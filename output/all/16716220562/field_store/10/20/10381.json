You wouldn't mind comin' into this 'ere grog-shop while I git change, would you?  Or if you'll lend me a sixpence I'll go in and git it for you.\"  \"No,\" said I, putting my fingers into my waistcoat pocket; \"but here is a sixpence for you, which you may keep, and never mind the change, if you'll walk along the streets with me a bit.\"  The urchin held out his dirty hand, and I put the coin into it.  He smiled, tossed the sixpence, caught it deftly, and transferred it to his right trousers pocket.  \"Vell, you are a rum 'un.  But I say, all square?  No dodges?  Honour bright?\"  \"No dodges.  Honour bright,\" I replied.  \"Come along.\"  At this point my attention was attracted by a sudden change in the behaviour of Dumps.  He went cautiously towards the boy, and snuffed as him for a moment.  \"I say, is he wicious?\" he asked, backing a little.  \"I think not, but--\"  I was checked in my speech by the little dog uttering a whine of delight and suddenly dancing round the boy, wagging its tail violently, and indeed wriggling its whole shapeless body with joy; as some dogs are wont to do when they meet with an old friend unexpectedly.  \"Why, he seems to know you,\" said I, in surprise.  \"Vell, he do seem to 'ave 'ad the honour of my acquaintance some'ow,\" returned the boy, whose tone of banter quickly passed away.  \"What d'ee call 'im?\"  \"Dumps,\" said I.  \"That won't do.  Has he a vite spot on the bridge of 'is nose?\" asked the boy earnestly.  \"I really cannot tell.  It is not long--\"  \"Here, Punch, come here!\" called the boy, interrupting.  At the name of Punch my doggie became so demonstrative in his affections that he all but leaped into the boy's arms, whined lovingly, and licked his dirty face all over.  \"The wery dog,\" said the boy, after looking at his nose; \"only growed so big that his own mother wouldn't know 'im.--Vy, where 'ave you bin all this long while, Punch?\"  \"D'you mean to say that you know the dog, and that his name is Punch?\"  \"Vell, you _are_ green.  Wouldn't any cove with half an eye see that the dog knows me, an' so, in course, I must know _him_?  An' ven I called 'im Punch didn't he answer?--hey?\"  I was obliged to admit the truth of these remarks.  After the first ebullition of joy at the meeting was over, we went along the street together.  \"Then the dog is yours?\" said I as we went along.  \"No, he ain't mine.  He was mine once--ven he was a pup, but I sold 'im to a young lady for--a _wery_ small sum.\"  \"For how much?\"  I asked.  \"For five bob.  Yes--on'y five bob!  I axed vun pound, but the young lady was so pleasant an' pritty that I come down to ten bob.  Then she said she was poor--and to tell 'ee the plain truth she looked like it-- an' she wanted the pup so bad that I come down to five.\"  \"And who was this young lady?\"  \"Blow'd if I knows.  She went off wi' my Punch, an' I never saw'd 'em more.\"  \"Then you don't know what induced her to sell Punch to a low fellow--but of course you know nothing about that,\" said I, in a musing tone, as I thought of the strange manner in which this portion of my doggie's history had come to light, but I was recalled from my reverie by the contemptuous tones of my little companion's voice, as he said--  \"But I _do_ know something about that.\"  \"Oh, indeed!  I thought you said you never saw the young lady again.\"  \"No more I did.  Neither did I ever see Punch again till to-day, but I know for certain that my young lady never sold no dog wotsomedever to no _low_ feller as ever walked in shoe leather or out of it!\"  \"Ah, I see,\" said I slowly, \"you mean--\"  \"Yes, out with it, that's just wot I do mean--that the low feller prigged the pup from her, an' I on'y vish as I 'ad a grip of his ugly nose, and I'd draw it out from his uglier face, I would, like the small end of a telescope, and then shut it up flat again--so flat that you'd never know he'd had no nose at all!\"  My little sharp-witted companion then willingly gave me an account of all he knew about the early history of my doggie.  The story was not long, but it began, so to speak, at the beginning.  Punch, or Dumps, as I continued to call him, had been born in a dry water-butt which stood in a back yard near the Thames.  This yard was, or had been, used for putting away lumber.  \"It was a queer place,\" said my little companion, looking up in my face with a droll expression--\"a sort o' place that, when once you had gone into it, you was sure to wish you hadn't.  Talk o' the blues, sir; I do assure _you_ that w'en I used to go into that yard of a night it gave me the black-an'-blues, it did.  There was a mouldiness an' a soppiness about it that beat the katticombs all to sticks.  It looked like a place that some rubbish had bin flung into in the days before Adam an' Eve was born, an' 'ad been forgotten tee-totally from that time to this.  Oh, it was awful!  Used to make my marrow screw up into lumps w'en I was used to go there.\"  \"But why did you go there at all if you disliked it so much?\"  I asked.  \"Vy? because I 'adn't got no better place to go to.  I was used to sleep there.  I slep' in the self-same water-butt where Punch was born. That's 'ow I come to scrape acquaintance with 'im.  I'd bin away from 'ome in the country for a week's slidin'.\"  \"A week's what?\"  \"Slidin'.  Don't you know what sliding on the ice is?\"  \"Oh!--yes.  Are you very fund of that?\"  \"I should think I was--w'en my boots are good enough to stick on, but they ain't always that, and then I've got to slide under difficulties. Sometimes I'm out o' boots an' shoes altogether, in vich case slidin's impossible; but I can look on and slide in spirit, vich is better than nuffin'.  But, as I was sayin' w'en you 'ad the bad manners to interrupt me, I 'ad bin away from 'ome for a week--\"  \"Excuse my interrupting you again, but where is your home, may I ask?\"  \"You may ask, but it 'ud puzzle me to answer for I ain't got no 'ome, unless I may say that London is my 'ome.  I come an' go where I pleases, so long's I don't worrit nobody.  I sleep where I like, if the bobbies don't get their eyes on me w'en I'm agoin' to bed, an' I heat wotever comes in my way if it ain't too tough.  In winter I sleeps in a lodgin' 'ouse w'en I can but as it costs thrippence a night, I finds it too expensive, an' usually prefers a railway arch, or a corner in Covent Garden Market, under a cart or a barrow, or inside of a empty sugar-barrel--anywhere so long's I'm let alone; but what with the rain, the wind, the cold, and the bobbies, I may be said to sleep under difficulties.  Vell, as I was agoin' to say w'en--\"  \"Excuse me once more--what is your name?\" said I.  \"Hain't got no name.\"  \"No name!  Come, you are joking.  What is your father's name?\"  \"Hain't got no father--never 'ad, as I knows on, nor mother neither, nor brother, nor sister, nor aunt, nor wife--not even a mother-in-law.  I'm a unit in creation, I is--as I once heerd a school-board buffer say w'en he was luggin' me along to school; but he was too green, that buffer was, for a school-boarder.  I gave 'im the slip at the corner of Watling Street, an' they've never bin able to cotch me since.\"  \"But you must be known by some name,\" said I.  \"What do your companions call you?\"  \"They call me bad names, as a rule.  Some o' the least offensive among 'em are Monkey-face, Screwnose, Cheeks, Squeaker, Roundeyes, and Slidder.  I prefers the last myself, an' ginerally answers to it.  But, as I was agoin' to say, I'd bin away for a veek, an' w'en I comed 'ome--\"  \"To which part of home? for London is a wide word, you know,\" I said.  \"Now, sir, if you go for to interrupt me like that I'll 'ave to charge a bob for this here valk; I couldn't stand it for sixpence.\"  \"Come, Slidder, don't be greedy.\"  \"Vell, sir, if you got as many kicks as I do, and as few ha'pence, p'r'aps you'd be greedy too.\"  \"Perhaps I should, my boy,\" said I, in a gentle tone.  \"But come, I will give you an extra sixpence if we get along well.  Let's have the rest of your story; I won't interrupt again.\"  \"It ain't my story, it's Punch's story,\" returned the waif, as he stooped to pat the gratified doggie.  \"Vell, w'en I com'd 'ome it was lateish and I was tired, besides bein' 'ungry; so I goes right off to my water-butt, intendin' to go to bed as usual, but no sooner did I put my head in, than out came a most awful growl.  The butt lay on its side, and I backed out double quick just in time, for a most 'orrible-lookin' terrier dog rushed at me.  Bein' used to dogs, I wasn't took by surprise, but fetched it a clip with one o' my feet in its ribs that sent it staggerin' to the palin' o' the yard.  It found a hole, bolted through, scurried up the lane yellin', and I never saw'd it more!  This was Punch's mother.  On goin' into the butt afterwards I found three dead pups and one alive, so I pitched the dead ones away an' shoved the live one into the breast of my coat, where he slep' till mornin'.  At first I 'ad a mind to drown the pup, but it looked so comfortable an' playful, an' was such a queer critter, that I called him Punch, an' became a father to 'im.  I got him bones an' other bits o' grub, an' kep' 'im in the water-butt for three veeks.  Then he began to make a noise v'en I left him; so, bein' sure the bobbies would rout 'im out at last, I took 'im an' sold 'im to the first pleasant lady that seemed to fancy 'im.\"  \"Well, Slidder,\" said I, as we turned down into the mean-looking alley where Mrs Willis, my little old woman, dwelt, \"I am greatly interested in what you have told me about my little dog, and I am interested still more in what you have told me about yourself.  Now, I want you to do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21752"],["title","My Doggie and I (#3)"],["body","a favour.  I wish you to go with me to visit an old woman, and, after that, to walk home with me--part of the way, at least.\"  The boy, whose pinched, hunger-smitten face had an expression of almost supernatural intelligence on it, bestowed on me a quick, earnest glance.  \"No dodges?  Honour bright?  You ain't a school-board buffer?\" he asked.  \"No dodges.  Honour bright,\" I replied, with a smile.  \"Vell, then, heave ahead, an' I'll foller.\"  We passed quickly down to the lower end of the alley, which seemed to lose itself in a wretched court that appeared as if it intended to slip into the river--an intention which, if carried out, would have vastly improved its sanitary condition.  Here, in a somewhat dark corner of the court, I entered an open door, ascended a flight of stairs, and gained a second landing.  At the farthest extremity of the passage I stopped at a door and knocked.  Several of the other doors of the passage opened, and various heads were thrust out, while inquisitive eyes surveyed me and my companion.  A short survey seemed to suffice, for the doors were soon shut, one after another, with a bang, but the door at which I knocked did not open.  Lifting the latch, I entered, and observed that Mrs Willis was seated by the window, looking wistfully out.  Being rather deaf, she had not heard my knock.  \"Come in,\" I whispered to little Slidder, \"sit down on this stool near the door, and keep quiet until I speak to you.\"  So saying, I advanced to the window.  The view was not interesting.  It consisted of the side of a house; about three feet distant, down which ran a water-spout, or drain-pipe, which slightly relieved the dead look of the bricks.  From one pane of the window it was possible, by squeezing your cheek against it, to obtain a perspective view of chimney-pots.  By a stretch of the neck upwards you could see more chimney pots.  By a stretch of imagination you could see cats quarrelling around them,--or anything else you pleased!  Sitting down on a rickety chair beside the little old woman, I touched her gently on the shoulder.  She had come to know my touch by that time, I think, for she looked round with a bright little smile.    CHAPTER THREE.  TREATS OF AN OLD HEROINE.  It was pleasant yet sad to observe the smile with which old Mrs Willis greeted me--pleasant, because it proved that she was rejoiced to see me; sad, because it was not quite in keeping with the careworn old face whose set wrinkles it deranged.  \"I knew you would come.  You never miss the day,\" she said, both words and tone showing that she had fallen from a much higher position in the social scale.  \"It costs me little to visit you once a week, dear Mrs Willis,\" I replied, \"and it gives me great pleasure; besides, I am bound by the laws of the Society which grants your annuity to call personally and pay it.  I only wish it were a larger sum.\"  \"Large enough; more than I deserve,\" said the old woman in a low tone, as she gazed somewhat vacantly at the dead wall opposite, and let her eyes slowly descend the spout.  The view was not calculated to distract or dissipate the mind.  The bricks were so much alike that the eye naturally sought and reposed on or followed the salient feature.  Having descended the spout as far as the window-sill permitted, the eyes of Mrs Willis slowly reascended as far as possible, and then turned with a meek expression to my face. \"More than I deserve,\" she repeated, \"and _almost_ as much as I require. It is very kind of the Society to give it, and of you to bring it.  May God bless you both!  Ah, doctor!  I'm often puzzled by--eh!  What's that?\"  The sudden question, anxiously asked, was accompanied by a feeble attempt to gather her poor garments close round her feet as Dumps sniffed at her skirts and agitated his ridiculous tail.  \"It's only my dog, granny,\"--I had of late adopted this term of endearment; \"a very quiet well-behaved creature, I assure you, that seems too amiable to bite.  Why, he appears to have a tendency to claim acquaintance with everybody.  I do believe he knows _you_!\"  \"No, no, he doesn't.  Put him out; pray put him out,\" said the old woman, in alarm.  Grieved that I had unintentionally roused her fear, I opened the door and called Dumps.  My doggie rose, with his three indicators erect and expectant.  \"Go out, sir, and lie down!\"  The indicators slowly drooped, and Dumps crawled past in abject humility.  Shutting the door, I returned.  \"I hope you don't dislike little boys as well as little dogs, granny, because I have brought one to wait for me here.  You won't mind his sitting at the door until I go?\"  \"No, no!\" said Mrs Willis quickly; \"I like little boys--when--when they're good,\" she added, after a pause.  \"Say I'm one o' the good sort, sir,\" suggested Slidder, in a hoarse whisper.  \"Of course, it ain't true, but wot o' that, if it relieves her mind?\"  Taking no notice of this remark, I again sat down beside my old woman.  \"What were you going to say about being puzzled, granny?\"  \"Puzzled, doctor! did I say I was puzzled?\"  \"Yes, but pray don't call me doctor.  I'm not quite fledged yet, you know.  Call me Mellon, or John.  Well, you were saying--\"  \"Oh, I remember.  I was only going to say that I've been puzzled a good deal of late by that text in which David says, `I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.'  Now, my father and mother were both good Christians, and, although I cannot claim to be a _good_ one myself, I do claim to be a poor follower of Jesus.  Yet here am I--\"  She paused.  \"Well, granny,\" said I, \"are you forsaken?\"  \"Nay, John, God forbid that I should say so; but am I not a beggar?  Ah pride, pride, you are hard to kill!\"  \"_Are_ you a beggar?\"  I asked in a tone of surprise.  \"When did you beg last, granny?\"  \"Is not a recipient of charity a beggar?\"  \"No,\" I replied stoutly, \"he is not.  A solicitor of charity is a beggar, but a recipient thereof is not.  In your case it was I who was the beggar.  Do you not remember when I found you first, without a crust in the house, how I had to beg and entreat you to allow me to put your name on this charity, and how you persistently refused, until at last I did it without your consent; and how, eventually, you gave in only when I charged you with pride?  You are not forsaken, granny, and you are not a beggar.\"  \"Brayvo, doctor! you have 'er there!\" came in a soft whisper from the door.  For a moment I felt tempted to turn the boy out, as I had turned out the dog; but, seeing that my old woman had not overheard the remark, I took no notice of it.  \"You have put the matter in a new light John,\" said Mrs Willis slowly, as her eyes once more sought the spout.  \"You often put things in new lights, and there does seem some truth in what you say.  It did hurt my pride at first, but I'm gettin' used to it now.  Besides,\" continued the old lady, with a deep sigh, \"that trouble and everything else is swallowed up in the great sorrow of my life.\"  \"Ah! you refer to your granddaughter, I suppose,\" said I in a tone of profound sympathy.  \"You have never told me about her, dear granny.  If it is not too painful a subject to speak of, I should like to hear about her.  When did she die?\"  \"Die!\" exclaimed Mrs Willis with a burst of energy that surprised me--\"she did not die!  She left me many, many months ago, it seems like years now.  My Edie went out one afternoon to walk, like a beautiful sunbeam as she always was, and--and--she never came back!\"  \"Never came back!\"  I echoed, in surprise.  \"No--never.  I was not able to walk then, any more than now, else I would have ranged London all round, day and night, for my darling.  As it was, a kind city missionary made inquiries at all the police-offices, and everywhere else he could think of, but no clew could be gained as to what had become of her.  At last he got wearied out and gave it up.  No wonder; he had never seen Edie, and could not love her as I did.  Once he thought he had discovered her.  The body of a poor girl had been found in the river, which he thought answered to her description.  I thought so too when he told me what she was like, and at once concluded she had tumbled in by accident and been drowned--for, you see, my Edie was good and pure and true.  She could not have committed suicide unless her mind had become deranged, and there was nothing that I knew of to bring about that.  They got me with much trouble into a cab, and drove me to the place.  Ah! the poor thing--she was fair and sweet to look upon, with her curling brown hair and a smile still on the parted lips, as if she had welcomed Death; but she was not my Edie.  For months and months after that I waited and waited, feeling sure that she would come. Then I was forced to leave my lodging.  The landlord wanted it himself. I begged that he would let me remain, but he would not.  He was a hard-hearted, dissipated man.  I took another lodging, but it was a long way off, and left my name and new address at the old one.  My heart sank after that, and--and I've no hope now--no hope.  My darling must have met with an accident in this terrible city.  She must have been killed, and will never come back to me.\"  The poor creature uttered a low wail, and put a handkerchief to her old eyes.  \"But, bless the Lord!\" she added in a more cheerful tone, \"I will go to her--soon.\"  For some minutes I knew not what to say in reply, by way of comforting my poor old friend.  The case seemed indeed so hopeless.  I could only press her hand.  But my nature is naturally buoyant, and ready to hope against hope, even when distress assails myself.  \"Do not say there is no hope, granny,\" said I at last, making an effort to be cheerful.  \"You know that with God all things are possible.  It may be that this missionary did not go the right way to work in his search, however good his intentions might have been.  I confess I cannot imagine how it is possible that any girl should disappear in this "]]]
