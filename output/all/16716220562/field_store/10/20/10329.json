A rumble in the far distance--ominous and low at first, but rapidly increasing to the tones of distant thunder.  It is the night express for the North--going at fifty miles an hour.  At such a rate of speed it might go right round the world in twenty-one days!  While yet distant the whistle is heard, shrill, threatening, and prolonged. Louder and louder; it is nearing the curve now and the earth trembles-- the house trembles too, but Gertie's parted lips breathe as softly as before; baby's eyes are as tight and his entire frame as still as when he first fell asleep.  Mrs Marrot, too, maintains the monotony of her snore.  Round the curve it comes at last, hammer and tongs, thundering like Olympus, and yelling like an iron fiend.  The earthquake is \"on!\" The embankment shudders; the house quivers; the doors, windows, cups, saucers, and pans rattle.  Outside, all the sledge-hammers and anvils in Vulcan's smithy are banging an _obbligato_ accompaniment to the hissing of all the serpents that Saint Patrick drove out of Ireland as the express comes up; still Gertie's rest is unbroken.  She does indeed give a slight smile and turn her head on the other side, as if she had heard a pleasant whisper, but nothing more.  Baby, too, vents a prolonged sigh before plunging into a profounder depth of repose.  Mrs Marrot gives a deprecatory grunt between snores, but it is merely a complimentary \"Hallo! 's that you?\" sort of question which requires no answer.  As the rushing storm goes by a timid and wakeful passenger happens to lower the window and look out.  He sees the house.  \"It's all over?\" are his last words as he falls back in his seat and covers his face with his hands.  He soon breathes more freely on finding that it is not all over, but fifteen or twenty miles lie between him and the house he expected to annihilate, before his nervous system has quite recovered its tone.  This, reader, is a mere sample of the visitations by which that family was perpetually affected, though not afflicted.  Sometimes the rushing masses were heavy goods trains, which produced less fuss, but more of earthquake.  At other times red lights, intimating equally danger and delay, brought trains to a stand close to the house, and kept them hissing and yelling there as if querulously impatient to get on.  The uproar reached its culminating point about 12:45, on the night of which we write, when two trains from opposite directions were signalled to wait, which they did precisely opposite John Marrot's windows, and there kept up such a riot of sound as feeble language is impotent to convey. To the accustomed ears the whistle and clank of a checked and angry pilot-engine might have been discerned amid the hullabaloo; but to one whose experience in such matters was small, it might have seemed as though six or seven mad engines were sitting up on end, like monster rabbits on a bank, pawing the air and screaming out their hearts in the wild delirium of unlimited power and ungovernable fury.  Still, although they moved a little, the sleepers did not awake--so potent is the force of habit!  However, it did not last long.  The red lights removed their ban, the white lights said \"Come on,\" the monster rabbits gave a final snort of satisfaction and went away--each with its tail of live-stock, or minerals, or goods, or human beings, trailing behind it.  The temporary silence round the house was very intense, as may well be believed--so much so that the heavy foot-fall of a man in the bypath that led to it sounded quite intrusive.  He was a tall broad-shouldered man in a large pilot coat, cap and boots, and appeared to walk somewhat lame as he approached the door.  He tried the handle.  It was locked, of course.  \"I thought so,\" he muttered in a low bass voice; \"so much for a bad memory.\"  He rapped twice on the door, loudly, with his knuckles and then kicked it with his boot.  Vain hope!  If a burglar with a sledge-hammer had driven the door in, he would have failed to tickle the drum of any ear there.  The man evidently was aware of this, for, changing his plan, he went round to a back window on the ground-floor, and opened it at the top with some difficulty.  Peeping in he gazed for some time intently, and then exclaimed under his breath, \"Ha! it's open by good luck.\" Gathering a handful of gravel, he threw it into the house with considerable force.  The result proved that he had not aimed at random, for the shower entered the open door of Nanny's sleeping-cellar and fell smartly on her face.  It is well-known that sailors, although capable of slumbering through loud and continuous noises, can be awakened by the slightest touch, so likewise Nanny.  On receiving the shower of gravel she incontinently buried her head in the blankets, drew an empty coal-scuttle over her shoulders and began to shout thieves! and murder! at the top of her voice.  Having taken such pains to muffle it, of course no one heard her cries.  The man, if a burglar, had evidently a patient philosophical turn of mind, for he calmly waited till the damsel was exhausted, and when she at length peeped out to observe the effect of her heroic efforts at self-preservation he said quietly, \"Nanny, lass, don't be a fool!  It's me; open the door; I've gone an' forgot my latch-key.\"  \"Oh la! master, it ain't you, is it?  It ain't thieves and robbers, is it?\"  \"No, no.  Open the door like a good girl.\"  \"And it ain't an accident, is it?\" continued Nanny partially dressing in haste.  \"Oh, I knows it's a accident, Missus always prophesied as a accident would come to pass some day, which has come true.  You're not maimed, master?\"  \"No, no; be quick, girl!\"  \"Nor Willum ain't maimed, is he?  He ain't dead?  Oh _don't_ say Willum is--\"  \"Bill Garvie's all right,\" said the engine-driver, as he brushed past the girl and went up-stairs.  Now, although Mrs Marrot's ears were totally deaf to locomotives they were alert enough to the sound of her husband's voice.  When, therefore, he entered the kitchen, he found her standing on the floor with an ample shawl thrown round her.  \"Nothing wrong?\" she inquired anxiously.  \"Nothing, Molly, my dear, only I got a slight bruise on the leg in the engine-shed to-day, and I had to go up an' show it to the doctor, d'ye see, before comin' home, which has made me later than usual.\"  \"Are you _sure_ it's not a back hurt, father?\" asked Loo, coming in at the moment--also enveloped in a shawl, and looking anxious.  \"Sure? ay, I'm sure enough; it's only a scratch.  See here.\"  Saying this he removed one of his boots, and pulling up his trousers displayed a bandaged leg.  \"Well, but we can't see through the bandages, you know,\" said Mrs Marrot.  \"Let me take them off, father, and I'll replace--\"  \"Take 'em off!\" exclaimed John, pulling down the leg of his trouser and rising with a laugh.  \"No, no, Loo; why, it's only just bin done up all snug by the doctor, who'd kick up a pretty shindy if he found I had undid it.  There's one good will come of it anyhow, I shall have a day or two in the house with you all; for the doctor said I must give it a short rest.  So, off to bed again, Loo.  This is not an hour for a respectable young woman to be wanderin' about in her night-dress.  Away with you!\"  \"Was any one else hurt, father?\" said Loo.  She asked the question anxiously, but there was a slight flush on her cheek and a peculiar smile which betrayed some hidden feeling.  \"No one else,\" returned her father.  \"I tell 'ee it wasn't an accident at all--it was only a engine that brushed up agin me as I was comin' out o' the shed.  That's all; so I just came home and left Will Garvie to look after our engine.  There, run away.\"  Loo smiled, nodded and disappeared, followed by Mrs Marrot, who went, like a sensible woman, to see that her alarmed domestic was all right. While she was away John went to the crib and kissed the rosy cheek of his sleeping boy.  Then he bent over the bed with the white dimity curtains to Miss Gertie's forehead, for which purpose he had to remove a mass of curly hair with his big brown hand.  \"Bless you, my darling,\" he said in silent speech, \"you came near bein' fatherless this night--nearer than you ever was before.\"  He kissed her again tenderly, and a fervent \"thank the Lord!\" rose from his heart to heaven.  In less than half-an-hour after this the engine-driver's family sank into profound repose, serenaded by the music of a mineral train from the black country, which rushed laboriously past their dwelling like an over-weighted thunderbolt.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE DRIVER VISITS A LITTLE ELDERLY GENTLEWOMAN AND PREPARES THE IRON HORSE FOR ACTION.  Next day John Marrot spent the brief period of repose accorded by the doctor to his leg in romping about the house with the baby in his arms. Being a large man, accustomed to much elbow-room and rapid motion, and the house being small, John may be said to have been a dangerous character in the family on such occasions.  Apart from baby, no elephant was ever more sluggish in his motions; but when coupled--professionally speaking--to his own tender infant, John knew no bounds, his wife knew no rest and his baby knew no higher earthly bliss.  Sometimes it was on his shoulder, sometimes on his head and often on his foot, riding with railway speed to \"Banbury Cross.\"  Again it was on its back in the crib or on the bed being tickled into fits of laughter, which bid fair at times to merge into fits of convulsion, to the horror of little Gertie, who came in for a large share of that delightful holiday's enjoyment, but whose spirit was frequently harrowed with alarm at the riotous conduct of her invalid father.  In his glee the man might have been compared to a locomotive with a bad driver, who was constantly shutting off the steam and clapping on the brakes too soon or too late, thus either falling short of or overshooting his mark.  What between the door and the dresser,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21740"],["title","The Iron Horse (#2)"],["body","fire, the crib, the window, and the furniture, John showed himself a dreadfully bad pilot and was constantly running into or backing out of difficulties.  At last towards the afternoon of that day, while performing a furious charge round the room with baby on his head, he overturned the wash-tub, which filled the baby with delirious joy, and Gertie with pleasurable alarm.  As for Mrs Marrot, she was too happy to have her husband at home for a whole day to care much about trifles, nevertheless she felt it her duty to reprove him, lest the children should learn a bad lesson.  \"There now, John, I knew you'd do it at last.  You're much too violent, and you shouldn't ought to risk the baby's neck in that way.  Such a mess!  How _can_ you expect me to keep things tidy if you go on so?\"  John was very penitent.  He did not reply at first, but putting baby into the crib--where it instantly drowned with a great yell the shriek of a passing train--he went down on his knees and began to \"swab\" up the water with a jack-towel.  Loo ran laughingly from the corner where she had been sewing, and insisted on doing it for him.  \"You'll hurt your leg, father, if you bend it so, and I'm sure it must be swelled and pained enough already with so much romping.\"  \"Not a bit, Loo,\" objected John.  \"It was me as caused the mess, an' justice requires that I should swab it up.  There, go sew that sentiment into a sampler an' hang it up over yer bed.\"  But Loo would not give in.  While they were still engaged in the controversy the door opened, and young Bob Marrot stood before them with his eyes wide open and his hair straight up on end, as if he had recently seen a ghost.  This aspect, however, was no sign of alarm, being his normal condition.  \"Ha! seems to me, somehow, that somebody's bin up to somethin'.\"  \"Right Bob,\" replied his father, rising from his knees and throwing the jack-towel at him.  The lad easily evaded the shot, being well accustomed to elude much more deadly missiles, and, picking up the towel, quietly set to work to perform the duty in dispute.  \"You're wanted,\" he said, looking up at his father while he wrung the towel over a tin basin.  \"Eh!  Where?\"  \"Up at the shed.\"  \"I'm on sick leave,\" said John.  \"Can't help that.  The 6:30 p.m. passenger train must be drove, and there's nobody left but you to drive it.  Jones is away with a goods train owin' to Maxwell having sprained his ankle, and Long Thompson is down with small-pox, so you'll have to do it.  I offered 'em my services, but the manager he said that intelligent lads couldn't be spared for such menial work, and told me to go and fetch you.\"  \"Maxwell had no business to sprain his ankle,\" said John Marrot. \"Hows'ever,\" he added cheerfully, \"I've had a rare good holiday, an' the leg's all but right again, so, Molly, let's have an early tea; I'll give it a good rest for another half-hour and then be ready for the 6:30 p.m-ers.  Cut off your steam, will you?\"  This last observation was made to the baby, and was accompanied by a shake and a toss towards the ceiling which caused him to obey instantly, under the impression, no doubt that the fun was to be renewed.  Being, however, consigned to the care of Gertie he again let on the steam and kept it up during the whole time the family were at tea--which meal they enjoyed thoroughly, quite regardless of the storm.  He was asleep when his father rose at last and buttoned his heavy coat up to the chin, while Mrs Marrot stood on tiptoe to arrange more carefully the woollen shawl round his neck.  \"Now, don't stand more than you can help on your hurt leg, John.\"  \"Certainly not, duckie,\" said John, stooping to kiss the upturned face; \"I'll sit on the rail as much as I can, like a 'Merican racoon.  By the way,\" he added, turning suddenly to Loo, \"you delivered that note from young Mr Tipps to his mother?\"  \"Yes, immediately after I got it from you; and I waited to see if there was an answer, but she said there wasn't.  It must have contained bad news, I fear, for she turned pale while she read it.\"  \"H'm, well,\" said John, putting on his cap, \"don't know nothin' about what was in it, so it's no bizzness o' mine.\"  With a hearty good-evening to all, and a special embrace to Gertie, the engine-driver left his home, accompanied by Bob his hopeful son.  \"Mr Sharp,\" said Bob, as they walked along, \"has bin makin' oncommon partikler inquiries among us about some o' the porters.  I raither think they're a bad lot.\"  \"Not at all,\" replied his father severely.  \"They're no more a bad lot than the drivers, or, for the matter of that, than the clerks or the directors, or the lamp-boys.  You ought to be gittin' old enough by this time, Bob, to know that every lot o' fish in this world, however good, has got a few bad uns among 'em.  As a rule railway directors and railway clerks, and railway porters and railway officials of all sorts are good--more or less--the same may be said of banks an' insurances, an' all sorts of things--but, do what ye may, a black sheep or two _will_ git in among 'em, and, of course, the bigger the consarn, the more numerous the black sheep.  Even the clergy ain't free from that uniwersal law of natur.  But what's Mr Sharp bin inquiring arter?\"  \"Ah--wot indeed!\" replied Bob; \"'ow should I know?  Mr Sharp ain't the man to go about the line with a ticket on his back tellin' wot he's arter.  By no means.  P'lice superintendents ain't usually given to that; but he's arter _somethin'_ partickler.\"  \"Well, that ain't no bizzness of ours, Bob, so we don't need to trouble our heads about it.  There's nothin' like mindin' yer own bizzness. Same time,\" added John after a short pause, \"that's no reason why, as a sea-farin' friend o' mine used to say, a man shouldn't keep his weather-eye open, d'ye see?\"  Bob intimated that he did see, by winking with the eye that chanced to be next his parent; but further converse between father and son was interrupted at a turn in the road, where they were joined by a stout, broad-shouldered young man, whose green velveteen jacket vest, and trousers bespoke him a railway porter.  \"Evenin', Sam,\" said our driver with a friendly nod; \"goin' on night dooty, eh?\"  \"Yes, worse luck,\" replied Sam, thrusting his powerful hands into his pockets.  \"Why so, Sam, you ain't used to mind night dooty?\"  \"No more I do,\" said Sam testily, \"but my missus is took bad, and there's no one to look after her properly--for that old 'ooman we got ain't to be trusted.  'Tis a hard thing to have to go on night dooty when a higher dooty bids me stay at home.\"  There was a touch of deep feeling in the tone in which the latter part of Sam Natly's remark was uttered.  His young wife, to whom he had been only a year married, had fallen into bad health, and latterly the doctors had given him little encouragement to hope for her recovery.  \"Sam,\" said John Marrot stopping, \"I'll go an' send a friend, as I knows of, to look after yer wife.\"  \"A friend?\" said Sam; \"you can't mean any o' your own family, John, for you haven't got time to go back that length now, and--\"  \"Well, never mind, I've got time to go where I'm agoin'.  You run on to the shed, Bob, and tell Garvie that I'll be there in fifteen minutes.\"  The engine-driver turned off abruptly, and, increasing his pace to a smart walk, soon stood before the door of one of those uncommonly small neat suburban villas which the irrigating influence of the Grand National Trunk Railway had caused to spring up like mushrooms around the noisy, smoky, bustling town of Clatterby--to the unspeakable advantage of that class of gentlefolk who possess extremely limited incomes, but who, nevertheless, prefer fresh air to smoke.  \"Is your missus at 'ome?\" he inquired of the stout elderly woman who answered to his modest summons--for although John was wont to clatter and bang through the greater part of his daily and nightly career, he was tender of touch and act when out of his usual professional beat.  \"Yes; do you wish to see her?\"  \"I does, my dear.  Sorry I 'aven't got a card with me, but if you'll just say that it's John Marrot, the engine-driver, I dessay that'll do for a free pass.\"  The elderly woman went off with a smile, but returned quickly with an anxious look, and bade the man follow her.  He was ushered into a small and poorly furnished but extremely neat and clean parlour, where sat a thin little old lady in an easy-chair, looking very pale.  \"Ev'nin', ma'am,\" said John, bowing and looking rougher and bigger than usual in such a small apartment.  \"You--you--don't bring bad news, I hope!--my son Joseph--\"  \"Oh no, Mrs Tipps, not by no means,\" said Marrot, hasting to relieve the timid old lady's feelings, \"Mr Joseph is all right--nothing wotiver wrong with him--nor likely to be, ma'am.  Leastwise he wos all right w'en I seed 'im last.\"  \"And when might that be?\" asked the timid old lady with a sigh of relief as she clasped her hands tightly together.  \"W'y, let me see,\" said John, touching his forehead, \"it was yesterday evenin' w'en I came up with the northern express.\"  \"But many accidents might have happened since yesterday evening,\" said Mrs Tipps, still in an anxious tone.  \"That's true, ma'am.  All the engines on the Grand Trunk from the Pentland Firth to the Channel might have bu'sted their bilers since that time--but it ain't likely,\" replied John, with a bland smile.  \"And--and what was my son doing when you passed him?  Did you speak to him?\"  \"Speak to him!  Bless your heart, ma'am,\" said John, with another benignant smile, \"I went past Langrye station at sixty mile an hour, so we hadn't much chance to speak to each other.  It would have been as much as we could have managed, if we'd tried it, to exchange winks.\"  \"Dreadful!\" exclaimed Mrs Tipps in a low tone.  \"Is that the usual rate of travelling on your railway?\"  \"Oh dear no, ma'am.  It's only _my_ express train as goes at that rate. Other expresses run between forty and fifty miles, an' or'nary"]]]
