For her mission is a true one, And the river ever true, Rolls along the grandest valley, That a river e'er rolled through; Peopled by a population Rich in soul and thought divine, From her source up in the mountains, Till her soul the sea entwines.  Turning to the sun that's setting, Setting far beyond the rim, Of the horizon of vision, Where the eyes grow weak and dim, You behold the Swannanoa, Naiad, pure and fresh and sweet, Crystalline, and cool and limpid, Strays some other stream to greet.  From the cliffside in the mountains Roll a thousand little streams, Laughing as they greet each other, Where the sunshine never beams; Rippling, idling, swirling slowly, Leaping down a waterfall, You can hear the drops of water, Sweetly to their compeers call.  Down the valley glides the river, Murmuring a sad farewell, To the birds and bees and people, Who along its highway dwell; Wishing them a happy future, Wishing them prosperity, While it fills its many missions 'Twixt the mountains and the sea.  Bathing rocks, refreshing people, Casting up its silver spray, As it glides along the valley, Flows forever and for aye. Men may move their tents and chattels, Others die or go astray, Still the stream flows fresh forever, Never resting night or day.  Giving life unto the flowers, Blooming on its verdant side, As it travels, as it journeys, As its ripples make their stride. In the gloaming of the twilight, When the birds had ceased to fly, And the dazzling dome of heaven Gave resplendence to the sky.  Occoneechee, squaw and warrior, Watched the stream, as on it sped, Rippling o'er the pebbly bottom, Lying on its rocky bed; Grasses waving green around them, Nodding boughs bid them adieu, And it wafted them caresses, Like the sunbeams sparkling dew.  Precious fragrance filled the valley, From the sweet shrub and the pine, Luscious fruits and ripening melons Lade the apple tree and vine. All along the pretty valley, Harvest fields and curing hay Make the white man rich and happy, Where the warriors used to stray.  At the juncture of the river, Where the Indians used to dwell, Where they made their pots of red clay, Made them crude but made them well, Here they tented long and hunted, Fished the Tah-kee-os-tee stream, Strolled along the racing river, Where its rippling waters gleam.  Moons passed on, and yet no greetings Came to cheer the wandering maid, Who so long had sought her lover, Till her hopes began to fade, And she felt that she must hasten, Quickly hasten thru the wild, By the rapid river racing, She the nature-loving child.  Then they took their little ponies, Girt them with a roebuck hide, Seated on the nimble ponies, Started swiftly on the ride, On to Toxaway the river, On to Toxaway the lake, Where the leaf of vine and alder, Hide the muskrat and the snake.  All along the racing river, Gorgeous forest trees are seen, And the wild deer in the forest Dwells beneath the coat of green. Here the beaver, hare and turkey Share their food and come to drink, In the splendid spreading forest, Near the Tah-kee-os-tee's brink.  Here they fished and caught the rainbow, Caught the little mountain trout, In the lake and in the river, With their poles both crude and stout; Caught the squirrel and the pheasant, Chased the turkey, deer and bear, Caught a-plenty, all they needed, Yet they had not one to spare.  In the sapphire land they lingered Many days and many nights, On the mountains, 'mid the laurel, Looking at the wondrous sights, That will greet you in the mountains, That you see in vales below, As you tread the paths untrodden, As you wander to and fro.  In the forest land primeval Where the fountains form their heads, Lies the famous vale of flowers, Splendid valley of pink beds. Every tribe and every hunter Knows this lone secluded spot, From the other vales so famous; When once seen is ne'er forgot.  In this vale of flowers and sunshine, Lies the Aidenn, most tranquil, Where the sore and heavy-laden, Gambol peacefully at will; Hear the trill of distant music, Played on Nature's vibrant chime, Resonant with sweetest concord All attuned to perfect time.  Here the weary, heavy-laden Soul, may lose his load of care, And the body, sick and wounded, Find an answer to his prayer. Precious incense here arises, From the brasier of the vale That ascends the lofty mountains, By an unseen, trackless trail.  Pisgah stands, the peer and rival Of Olympus, famed of old, Where the gods met in their councils, And their consultations held. Looking far across the valleys, They behold on either side, Rivers, vales and gushing fountains, Which forever shall abide.  In the distance stands eternal, Junaluska's pretty mound, Which in beauty of the landscape Is the grandest ever found. Rushing streams of purest water, Giving off their silver spray, Add a beauty to the forest, In a new and novel way.  And the balsam peaks of fir tree Looks like midnight in the day, Looks like shadows in the sunshine, In the fading far away. Dense and dark and much foreboding Apprehensions do declare, To the one who sleeps beneath them With its flood of balmy air.  \"Occoneechee, forest dweller, We have traveled many miles, Through the mountains, o'er the valleys, Where the face of Nature smiled; We have tasted of the fountains, Whence breaks forth the Keowee, Nymph of beauty, joy and pleasure, Once the home of Cherokee.  We have rested near the water, Seen the fleck and shimmering flow, Of the waters kissed by Nature, Lovely river Tugaloo, Where the Cherokee once rambled, Spoiled 'mid the scenes so wild, Where the forest and the river Have the wood-gods oft beguiled.  Wandered o'er the sapphire country, Land which doth the soul delight, With its mounds and vales and rivers; God ne'er made a holier site For the human race to dwell in, Where the human soul can rise, Higher in its aspirations Toward the rich Utopian skies\"  Here the lyrics sung by Nature, Played upon its strings of gold, Float out on the evening breezes, And its music ne'er grows old, To the soul and life and spirit, Which is bent and bowed with care. This the sweetest land Elysian, To the one who wanders there.  Convolutions of the lilies, Tranquil bloom and curve and die, Near the river, 'neath the shadows Of the white pine, smooth and high. Sparkling, gleaming in the sunlight Bursts the water, pure and free, From the rocks high on the mountains, Once the home of Cherokee.  Dancing, rippling, roaring, rushing, Comes Tallulah in its rage, Like an eagle bounding forward, From an exit in a cage. In the distance, you behold it Rise and babble, laugh and smile; Then amid the reeds and rushes, Turns and loiters for awhile.  Then it curves among the eddies, Hastens on to meet the bend, In the meadows, like the fragrance Borne aloft upon the wind; Silently reflecting sunbeams To the distant verdant hill From its surface calm and placid, Smooth, untarnished little rill;  Gleams and glides accelerated, As it gathers, as it grows, As the brook becomes a river, As it ever onward flows; Swirls and turns and dashes downward, Heaves and moans and dashes wild, For a chasm down the canyon, Like a lost, demented child;  Furious, frantic, leaps and lashes Down into the great abyss, Falls and foams and seethes forever Where the rocks and river kiss. Tallulah Falls, the work and wonder Of the cycles and the age, Pours its deluge down the ravine, Unobstructed in its rage.  Flying fowls of evil omen, Dare not stop it in its flight, Lest the river overwhelm them With its power of strength and might-- Lest the river dash to pieces Bird or beast that would impede Such a torrent as confronts you With its force of fearful speed.  Then it rushes fast and furious Into mist and fog and spray, Rises like the ghost of Banquo, Will not linger, stop nor stay. O'er the precipice it plunges, Bounds and surges down the steep, As it gushes forth forever, Toward the blue and boundless deep.  In the Appalachian mountains Stands Satulah, high and proud, With its base upon the Blue Ridge, And its head above the cloud. From its top the panorama Rises grandly into view, And presents a thousand landscapes, Every one to Nature true.  Round by round the mountains rise up, Round on round, and tier on tier, You behold them in their beauty, Through a vista, bright and clear. Like concentric circles floating, Ebbing on a crystal bay To the distance they're receding, Fading like declining day.  Hardby stands the Whiteside Mountain, Like an athlete, strong and tall, Perpendicularly rising As a mighty granite wall; Towering o'er the Cashier's valley, Stretching calmly at its base, Like a bouquet of rich roses Beautifying Nature's vase.  High above the other mountains, Whiteside stands in bold relief, With its court house and its cavern Refuge for the soul with grief; Like a monolith it rises To a grand majestic height, Till its crest becomes a mirror, To refract the rays of light.  From its summit grand and gorgeous Like a splendid stereoscope, Comes a view yet undiscovered Full of awe, and life and hope. Smiling vales and nodding forests Greet you like a loving child, From the zenith of the mountain, Comes the landscape undefiled.  Flying clouds pour forth their shadows, As the curious mystic maze Shrouds the mountains from the vision, With its dark and lowering haze. Fog so dense come stealing o'er you That you know not day from night, Till the rifting of the shadows Makes room for the golden light.  In the Blue Ridge, near the headland In the Hamburg scenic mountains, Comes a silver flow of water From a score of dancing fountains, Tripping lightly, leaping gently, Slipping 'neath the underbrush Without noise it creepeth slowly Toward the place of onward rush.  Floats along beneath the hemlock, Nods to swaying spruce and pine, Murmurs in its pebbly bottom Holds converse with tree and vine. Winds around the jutting ledges Of translucent spar and flint, With effulgence like the jasper With its glare and gleam and glint.

Thus the Tuckaseigee river Rises far back in the dell, Where the dank marsh of the mountain Rise and fall, assuage and swell, Till its flow becomes augmented By a thousand little streams Coming from the rocky highlands Through their fissures and their seams.  Fills the valley, passes quickly, Trips and falls a hundred feet, Swirls a moment, makes a struggle, Doth the same rash act repeat. Rushes, rages, fumes and surges, Dashes into mist and spray, Heaves and sighs, foments and lashes, As it turns to rush away;  Roars and fills the earth and heaven With the pean of its rage, Plunges down deep in the gulches, Where the rocks are worn with age. Maddened by the sudden conflict, Starts anew to rend the wall That confines its turbid waters To the defile and the fall.  Once again it leaps and rushes Toward the towering granite wall, And it bounds full many a fathom In its final furious fall. Much it moans and seethes and surges, Starts again at rapid speed, O'er the rocky pot-hole gushes Like a gaited blooded steed.  Thus the Tuckaseigee river Falls into the great abyss Down the canyon, rough and rugged, Where the spar and granite kiss. Then it flows still fast and faster, With its flood both bright and clear, Through the cycles ripe with ages Month on month and year on year.  Near the apex of the mountains, In the silence of the dale, Where no human foot has trodden Path or road or warrior's trail, From the tarn or seep there drippeth Crystal water bright and free, That becomes a nymph of beauty, Pretty vale of Cullowhee.  In the spreading vale the townhouse, And the Indian village stood; In the alcove, well secluded, In the grove of walnut wood. Ancient chiefs held many councils, Sung the war-song, kept the dance, While the squaws and pretty maidens Vie each other in the prance.  Cullowhee, thou stream and valley, Once the domicile and home, Of a people free and happy, Free from tribal fear and gloom, Where, O where, are thy great warriors-- Where thy chiefs and warriors bold-- Who once held in strict abeyance Those who plundered you of old?  Gone forever are thy warriors, Gone thy chiefs and maidens fair, Vanished like the mist of summer, Gone! but none can tell us where. From their homes were hounded, driven, Like the timid hind or deer, Herded like the driven cattle, Forced from home by gun and spear.  \"Tell me, vale or rippling water, Tell me if ye can or will, If you've seen my long-lost lover Known as wandering Whippoorwill?\" But the water, cool and placid, That comes from the mountain high Swirled a moment, then departing Made no answer or reply.  Then the maiden's grief grew greater, As she lingered by the stream Watching for some sign or token Or some vision through a dream; But no dream made revelation, Only sorrow filled her years, And her eyes lost much of luster As her cheeks suffused with tears.  Turning thence into the forest Over hill and brook and mound, To the Cullasaja river Through the forest land they wound; Through the tangled brush and ivy, Rough and rugged mountainside, Led the ponies through the forest, Far too steep for them to ride.  They descended trails deserted, Where the chieftains used to go, Near the Cullasaja river, Near its rough uneven flow; Camped upon its bank at evening, Heard at night the roar and splash Of the voice of many waters Down the fearful cascade dash.  Stood at sunrise where the shadow Of the cliffs cast darkening shade, Where the rainbows chase the rainbow Like as sorrows chased the maid. Traveled down the silver current, Rested often on the way, Strolled the banks and fished the current Of the crystal Ellijay.  Pleasantly the winding current Eddies, swirls and loiters free Till it joins the radiant waters Of the little Tennessee; Where the mound stands in the meadow, Once the townhouse capped its crest, There the tribe was wont to gather, Council, plan and seek for rest.  To the mound the tribe assembled, From the regions all around, Came from Cowee and Coweeta, Where the Cherokee abound; Came from Nantahala mountains, Skeenah and Cartoogechaye, Nickajack and sweet Iola, And from Choga far away.  All the great men and the warriors Brought the women, and their wives, Came by hundreds without number, Like the swarms around the hives; But today there is no warrior, Not a maiden can be found, Tenting on the pretty meadow, Or upon Nik-wa-sa mound.  In the Cowee spur of mountains, Stands the Bald and Sentinel, Of the valley and the river, Of the moorland and the dell. Like a pyramid it rises, Layer on layer and flight on flight Till its crest ascends the confines Of the grand imperial height.  From its summit far receding, Contours of the mountains rise, Numerous as the constellations In the arched dome of the skies. Far away beyond the valley Double Top confronts the eye, Black Rock rises like a shadow On the blue ethereal sky.  Jones' Knob makes its appearance, Highest, grandest height of all Penetrates the vault of heaven, None so picturesque or tall. Wayah, Burningtown and Wesser Raise their bald heads to the cloud High and haughty, rich in beauty And extremely vain and proud.  Una and Yalaka mountains Stand so near up by the side Of the Cowee, that you'd take them For its consort or its bride. Festooned, wreathed and decorated With the honeysuckle bloom, And the lady-slipper blossom, There dispels the hour of gloom.  Ginseng and the Indian turnip Grow up from their fallow beds In the dark coves of the mountains, With their beaded crimson heads. Fertile fields and stately meadows Stretch along the sylvan streams And surpass the fields Elysian, Seen in visionary dreams.  From the summit of the Cowee In the season of the fall, Fog fills all the pretty valley Settles like the deathly pall, Coming from the rill and river, To the isothermal belt, Where the sunbeam meets the fog-line And the frost and ices melt.  Jutting tops of verdant mountains Penetrate the fog below, As the islands in the ocean Form the archipelago. Sea of fog stands out before you, With its islands and its reef Silent and devoid of murmur As the quivering aspen leaf.  \"Occoneechee, look to Northland, See the Smoky Mountains rise, Like a shadow in the valley Or a cloud upon the skies. Many days since you beheld them In their grand, majestic height; Many days from these you've wandered From their fountains, pure and bright.  \"Hie thee to the Smoky Mountains, Tarry not upon the plain, Linger not upon the border Of the fields of golden grain. Flee thee as a kite or eagle, Not a moment stop or stay, Hasten to Oconaluftee, Be not long upon the way.  \"I have much to speak unto you E'er I take my final leave, Some will sadden, some will gladden, Some bring joy and some will grieve. All our legends, myths and stories Soon will fall into decay, And I must transmit them to you E'er I turn to go away.  \"Mount thee, mount thee quick this pony, Spryly spring upon its back, Leave no vestige, sign or token Or the semblance of a track, Whereby man may trace or trail thee, In the moorland or morass, By the radiant river flowing Or secluded mountain pass.  \"Grasp the reins, hold fast the girdle, Like flamingoes make your flight To the great dome of the mountain That now gleams within your sight. Clingman's Dome, the crowning glory Of the high erupted hills, They will shield you and protect you, With its cliffs and rolling rills.\"  Sped they like the rolling current, Sped they like a gleam of light, Sped they as the flying phantom Or a swallow in its flight, To their refuge in the mountain, To the temple of the earth, Near the lonely spot secluded, That had known her from her birth.  Standing, gazing, watching, peering, Through the azure atmosphere, At the wilderness before you And the scene both rich and clear. Cerulean the gorgeous mountains Rise and loom up in your sight, Like a splendid constellation On a crisp autumnal night.  'Twixt the fall and winter season, Comes a tinge of milky haze, Stealing o'er the Smoky Mountains, Shutting out the solar rays, Flooding vales and filling valleys, Coming, creeping, crawling slow, Fills the firmament with shadows As with crystal flakes of snow.  Through the haze and mist and shadows You discern a ball of fire, From the rim of Nature rising As a knighted funeral pyre; Yet it moveth slowly upward, Creeps aloft along the sky, As a billow on the ocean Meets the ship, then passes by.  This you say is Indian summer, Tepid season of the year, When glad harvest songs ascendeth Full of hope and love and cheer. From Penobscot, down the Hudson, By the Susquehanna wild, Through the Shenandoah valley Roamed the forest-loving child.  Roamed the Mohawk and the Huron, Seneca and Wyandot, Delaware and the Mohican, Long since perished and forgot. Powhattan and Tuscarora, And the wandering Showano, Creek and Seminole and Erie, Miami and Pamlico,  Chicasaw and the Osages, Kickapoo and Illinois, Ottawas and Susquehannas, Objibwas and Iroquois, Once enjoyed the Indian summers, Once to all this land was heir, Sportive, free and lithe and happy, Chief and maid and matron fair.  As the blossoms in the forest Bloom, then fall into decay, So the mighty tribes here mentioned, Flourished, so traditions say; Then the coming of the white man, Spread consternation far and wide; Then decay and desolation Conquered all their manly pride.  Treaties made were quickly broken And their homes were burned with fire, Which provoked the mighty tribesmen And aroused their vengeful ire. Furious raids on hostile savage With the powder-horn and gun, Soon reduced the noble red man Slowly, surely, one by one,  Till not one now roams the forest, None are left to tell the tale; All their guns and bows are broken, None now for them weep or wail.
