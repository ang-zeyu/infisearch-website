Young Mr. Hill paused while sharpening his pencil to wave him a friendly greeting.  Stephen, craning in his seat, caught sight of Mr. Lincoln slouched into one of his favorite attitudes, his chin resting in his hand.  But who is this, erect, compact, aggressive, searching with a confident eye the wilderness of upturned faces? A personage, truly, to be questioned timidly, to be approached advisedly. Here indeed was a lion, by the very look of him, master of himself and of others. By reason of its regularity and masculine strength, a handsome face. A man of the world to the cut of the coat across the broad shoulders. Here was one to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation, like a character in a play, to arouse dreams of Washington and its senators and great men. For this was one to be consulted by the great alone. A figure of dignity and power, with magnetism to compel moods. Since, when he smiled, you warmed in spite of yourself, and when he frowned the world looked grave.  The inevitable comparison was come, and Stephen's hero was shrunk once more. He drew a deep breath, searched for the word, and gulped. There was but the one word. How country Abraham Lincoln looked beside Stephen Arnold Douglas!  Had the Lord ever before made and set over against each other two such different men? Yes, for such are the ways of the Lord.            ........................  The preliminary speaking was in progress, but Stephen neither heard nor saw until he felt the heavy hand of his companion on his knee.  \"There's something mighty strange, like fate, between them two,\" he was saying. \"I recklect twenty-five years ago when they was first in the Legislatur' together. A man told me that they was both admitted to practice in the S'preme Court in '39, on the same day, sir. Then you know they was nip an' tuck after the same young lady. Abe got her. They've been in Congress together, the Little Giant in the Senate, and now, here they be in the greatest set of debates the people of this state ever heard; Young man, the hand of fate is in this here, mark my words--\"  There was a hush, and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled. A man, lean, angular, with coat-tail: flapping-unfolded like a grotesque figure at a side-show.  No confidence was there. Stooping forward, Abraham Lincoln began to speak, and Stephen Brice hung his head and shuddered. Could this shrill falsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning? Could this awkward, yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom he had worshipped? Ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there, on the stand and from the crowd. Thrice distilled was the agony of those moments!  But what was this feeling that gradually crept over him? Surprise? Cautiously he raised his eyes. The hands were coming around to the front. Suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back, with a determined gesture, the head was raised,--and.--and his shame was for gotten. In its stead wonder was come. But soon he lost even that, for his mind was gone on a journey. And when again he came to himself and looked upon Abraham Lincoln, this was a man transformed. The voice was no longer shrill. Nay, it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on those who heard. Now it rose, and again it fell into tones so low as to start a stir which spread and spread, like a ripple in a pond, until it broke on the very edge of that vast audience.     \"Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,    against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude    slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State    Constitution?\"  It was out, at last, irrevocably writ in the recording book of History, for better, for worse. Beyond the reach of politician, committee, or caucus. But what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that these minutes even now basting into eternity held the Crisis of a nation that is the hope of the world? Not you, Judge Douglas who sit there smiling. Consternation is a stranger in your heart,--but answer the question if you can. Yes, your nimble wit has helped you out of many a tight corner. You do not feel the noose--as yet. You do not guess that your reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country. It is not you who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of Democracy splitting on the rocks at Charleston and at Baltimore, when the power of your name might have steered her safely.  But see! what is this man about whom you despise? One by one he is taking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your ship. Look, he holds them in his hands without mixing them, and shows the false construction of its secret parts.  For Abraham Lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid that many a farmer, dulled by toil, heard and understood and marvelled. The simplicity of the Bible dwells in those speeches, and they are now classics in our literature. And the wonder in Stephen's mind was that this man who could be a buffoon, whose speech was coarse and whose person unkempt, could prove himself a tower of morality and truth. That has troubled many another, before and since the debate at Freeport.  That short hour came all too quickly to an end. And as the Moderator gave the signal for Mr. Lincoln, it was Stephen's big companion who snapped the strain, and voiced the sentiment of those about him.  \"By Gosh!\" he cried, \"he baffles Steve. I didn't think Abe had it in him.\"  The Honorable Stephen A. Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled as he rose to reply. As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to die out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man's should be. The question seemed not to trouble him in the least. But for Stephen Brice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even as Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors, and left it punily naked.  Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as was the man himself. His height was insignificant. But he had the head and shoulders of a lion, and even the lion's roar. What at contrast the ring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr. Lincoln's opening words. If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly disappointed. Mr. Douglas was far from dismay. As if to show the people how lightly he held his opponent's warnings, he made them gape by putting things down Mr. Lincoln's shirt-front and taking them out of his mouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that the Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might lead one to expect. Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at Freeport? And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his hearers \"Black Republicans.\" \"Not black,\" came from the crowd again and again, and once a man: shouted, \"Couldn't you modify it and call it brown?\" \"Not a whit!\" cried the Judge, and dubbed them \"Yankees,\" although himself a Vermonter by birth. He implied that most of these Black Republicans desired negro wives.  But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate as he was, to get over that without offence to the great South? Very skillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations. And then, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might have been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell. But tighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.  Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length. How were you to foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol? Had your sight been long, you would have paused before your answer. Had your sight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before the Nation, and you are holding his hat. Judge Douglas, this act alone has redeemed your faults. It has given you a nobility of which we did not suspect you. At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so you left the name of a patriot.  Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis which your craftiness might overcome.  \"It matters not,\" you cried when you answered the Question, \"it matters not which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the Constitution. The people have the lawful means to introduce or to exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police regulations.\"  Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the Freeport Heresy.  It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster House after the debate, found Mr. Lincoln. On his knee, in transports of delight, was a small boy, and Mr. Lincoln was serenely playing on the child's Jew's-harp. Standing beside him was a proud father who had dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible. In a corner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who wished to talk about the Question.  But when he saw Stephen, Mr. Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome that is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished.  \"Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,\" he said.  \"Why, Mr. Lincoln,\" he exclaimed, \"you have had no time.\"  \"I have taken the time,\" Mr. Lincoln replied, \"and I think that I am well repaid. Steve,\" said he, \"unless I'm mightily mistaken, you know a little more than you did yesterday.\"  \"Yes, sir! I do,\" said Stephen.  \"Come, Steve,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"be honest. Didn't you feel sorry for me last night?\"  Stephen flushed scarlet.  \"I never shall again, sir,\" he said.  The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5390"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 03 (#8)"],["body","out. In its stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--the sadness of the world's tragedies, of Stephen stoned, of Christ crucified.  \"Pray God that you may feel sorry for me again,\" he said.  Awed, the child on his lap was still. The politician had left the room. Mr. Lincoln had kept Stephen's hand in his own.  \"I have hopes of you, Stephen,\" he said. \"Do not forget me.\"  Stephen Brice never has. Why was it that he walked to the station with a heavy heart? It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was to be. This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor's cabin and hoed his neighbor's corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster and flat-boatman. Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice around a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt; rescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who feared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but these are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political mobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers east and west. This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the Nation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and whose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing. So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work was done, died a martyr.  Abraham Lincoln died in His name     CHAPTER VI  It was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day, dusty and travel-worn and perspiring. He had come straight from the ferry, without going home. And he had visions of a quiet dinner with Richter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about Abraham Lincoln. Had Richter ever heard of Lincoln?  But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was more serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a smile of welcome.  \"You are a little behind your time, my friend,\" said he, \"What has happened you?\"  \"Didn't the Judge get Mr, Lincoln's message?\" asked Stephen, with anxiety.  The German shrugged his shoulders.  \"Ah, I know not,\" he answered, \"He has gone is Glencoe. The Judge is ill, Stephen. Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard. The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe. But he would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the country yesterday, and orders him. Ach!\" exclaimed Richter, impulsively, \"what wonderful women you have in America! I could lose my head when I think of Miss Carvel.\"  \"Miss Carvel was here, you say?\" Stephen repeated, in a tone of inquiry.  \"Donner!\" said Richter, disgusted, \"you don't care.\"  Stephen laughed, in spite of himself.  \"Why should I?\" he answered. And becoming grave again, added: \"Except on Judge Whipple's account. Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?\"  \"This morning one of Colonel Carvel's servants came for his letters. He must be feeling better. I--I pray that he is better,\" said Richter, his voice breaking. \"He has been very good to me.\"  Stephen said nothing. But he had been conscious all at once of an affection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself. That afternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company's to inquire. Mr. Whipple was better, so Mr. Hopper said, and added that he \"presumed likely the Colonel would not be in for a week.\" It was then Saturday. Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel's sanctum behind the partition, giving orders to several clerks at the time. He was so prosperous and important that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who went away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.  On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company's, Eliphalet was too busy to see him. But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with orders, told him that the \"Jedge was wuss, suh.\" On Wednesday, there being little change, Mrs. Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum. On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New Code, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him. In reply to his anxious question Ephum answered:  \"I reckon he better, suh. He an' de Colonel done commence wrastlin' 'bout a man name o' Linkum. De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh.\"  It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel's compliments, asking Mr. Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the Judge might wish to see. And since there was no convenient train in the evening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr. Brice would spend the night. The Colonel mentioned the train on which Mr. Brice was expected.  The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from the hot and treeless prairies of Illinois. As Stephen alighted at the little station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel's buggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.  There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and flowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road. At last they came to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden house with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle. And then he saw the Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar. This, indeed, was real country.  As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward the house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him.  \"You are very welcome, sir,\" he said gravely. \"The Judge is asleep now,\" he added. \"I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning, and my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day. Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr. Brice. Jackson!\" cried Mr. Carvel, \"show Mr. Brice to his room.\"  Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen's bag, and led the way upstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on the south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table. After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden from between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the railroad upon him, and descended. The Colonel was still on the porch, in his easy-chair. He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside him stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint. Colonel Carvel rose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.  \"Your health, Mr. Brice,\" he said, \"and I hope you will feel at home here, sir. Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you wish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country.\"  Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him a cigar. He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young Yankee. The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of hospitality to a stranger. He talked horse, and no great discernment on Stephen's part was needed to perceive that this was Mr. Carvel's hobby.  \"I used to have a stable, Mr. Brice, before they ruined gentleman's sport with these trotters ten years ago. Yes sir, we used to be at Lexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames track after that. Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?\"  Yes, Stephen had, from Mr. Jack Brinsmade.  The Colonel's face beamed.  \"Why, sir,\" he cried, \"that very nigger, Ned, who drove you here from the cars-he used to ride Netty Boone. Would you believe that, Mr. Brice? He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track here. He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one hundred and a quarter. And I kept him down to that weight a whole year, Mr. Brice. Yes, sirree, a whole year.\"  \"Kept him down!\" said Stephen.  \"Why, yes, sir. I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with holes bored in the seat. Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him. Many a time I took off ten pounds that way. It needs fire to get flesh off a nigger, sir.\"  He didn't notice his guest's amazement.  \"Then, sir,\" he continued, \"they introduced these damned trotting races; trotting races are for white trash, Mr. Brice.\"  \"Pa!\"  The Colonel stopped short. Stephen was already on his feet. I wish you could have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then. She wore a white lawn dress. A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted back, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden. It was so that these Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and Yankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they were ill.  Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word. But Virginia turned to him with perfect self-possession.  \"He has been boring you with his horses, Mr. Brice,\" she said. \"Has he told you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and a quarter?\" (A laugh.) \"Has he given you the points of Water Witch and Netty Boone?\" (More laughter, increasing embarrassment for Stephen.) \"Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this house. Your jockey talk is intolerable.\"  O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced intolerable.  Mr. Carvel reached for another cigar asked, \"My dear,\" he asked, \"how is the Judge?\"  \"My dear,\" said Virginia, smiling, \"he is asleep. Mammy Easter is with him, trying to make out what he is saying. He talks in his sleep, just as you do--\"  \"And what is he saying?\" demanded the Colonel, interested.  Virginia set down the tray.  \"'A house divided against itself,'\" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of her arm, \"'cannot stand. I believe that this Government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to dissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.' Would you like any more?\" added Miss Virginia.  \"No,\" cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table. \"Why,\" said he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, \"cuss me"]]]
