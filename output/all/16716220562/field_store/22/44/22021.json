Still it cannot be denied that some of his teachings set aside many parts of the law of Moses, and seemed to be in conflict with its spirit.  6. The Gospel Supplants the Law.--The seeming conflict, referred to in the last paragraph, between the law of Moses and the teachings of Messiah disappears when it is understood {45} that the gospel of Jesus Christ was about to supplant the law. The gospel, under Moses was offered to ancient Israel before they received the law of carnal commandments; but they would not live in accordance with its divine precepts, but hardened their hearts against it until the gospel, as also the higher priesthood, was taken from among them. The lesser priesthood, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel, repentance and baptism, and the law of carnal commandments (the spirit of which is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth) remained with them,[28] to educate and instruct them, that they might be prepared eventually for the fullness of the gospel. When Jesus began his ministry by proclaiming his gospel, the law of Moses was about fulfilled, and many of the carnal commandments and precepts were being pushed aside by the more excellent precepts of the gospel, even as many of the sacrifices and burnt offerings were to be discontinued after Messiah should be offered up as a sacrifice, of which the sacrifices before mentioned were but types and symbols. (See note 4, end of section.)  7. Twelve Apostles Called.--From among the disciples which followed him Jesus selected twelve men whom he called apostles. Their names were: Simon, commonly called Peter; Andrew, brother to Peter; James, the son of Zebedee, sometimes called James the Elder; John, brother to James above named; Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew, the publican, author of the book of Matthew in the New Testament; James, the son of Alphaeus, also called James the less, perhaps to distinguish him from James the elder, or because of his small stature;[29] Lebbaeus usually called by his surname Thaddaeus; Simon, the Canaanite; Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.  8. These twelve men Jesus sent out on a mission to the cities of Israel, forbidding them to go into the way of the Gentiles, or into the cities of the Samaritans. Their mission was to the {46} lost sheep of the house of Israel.[30] They were sent without purse and without scrip, nor were they to provide themselves with two coats nor take thought as to what they should eat, or wherewithal they would be clothed; but they were to trust to the Lord, being assured that the laborer is worthy of his hire.  9. The burden of their message was to be: \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" They also received power from their Master to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: and were admonished, since they had received freely, to give as freely to others. Jesus told them they were going as sheep among wolves; that they would be brought before governors and kings for his sake; that they would be delivered up to councils, and scourged in the synagogues; that they would be hated of all men for his sake; but they were also given the comforting assurance that they who would endure to the end should be saved.[31] These apostles went forth through the towns of Judea preaching the gospel and healing the sick.  10. Seventies Called.--The harvest being great and the laborers few, Jesus called seventies into the ministry to aid the twelve apostles. He sent them two and two before him into every city and place where he himself expected to go. The commission, powers and instructions which the seventies received were nearly the same as those given to the twelve apostles.[32] These seventies went forth as the apostles had done and returning from their labor bore record that the power of God was with them in their ministry and that the very devils were subject to them in the name of Jesus.[33]  11. The Order of Events.--It would be difficult if not impossible to relate even the chief events in the life of Messiah in the order in which they occurred, since no little confusion exists in respect to the succession of events in the narratives of the New Testament. (See note 5, end of section.) Nor is it necessary to our purpose to dwell in detail or in sequence {47} upon those matters. It is sufficient for us to know that after the events we have already noted Messiah's mission was more boldly declared. He proclaimed himself to be the Son of God; the Messiah of which the scriptures had borne record;[34] he taught men that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son to redeem it, that whosoever would believe in him might have everlasting life.[35] In addition to this great doctrine we have seen that he taught repentance; he likewise taught that men must be born (baptized) of the water and of the Spirit before they could enter into the kingdom of God;[36] he made and baptized more disciples than John;[37] he also taught the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and announced himself as possessing the keys and powers thereof.[38]  12. The Divinity of Messiah's Mission.--Jesus sustained the divinity of his mission by pointing to the conformity of the facts connected with his career with the predictions of the scriptures;[39] by the testimony which John the Baptist bore;[40] by the works which he did--his wonderful miracles wherein the power of God was made manifest;[41] and lastly, and best of all, the testimony of the Father himself which was promised unto all those who would do his (the Father's) will.[42]  NOTES.  1. Order of the Temptations.--The order of the temptations is given differently by St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Matthew placing second the scene on the pinnacle of the temple, and St. Luke the vision of the kingdoms of the world. Both orders cannot be right, and possibly St. Luke may have been influenced in his arrangement by the thought that a temptation to spiritual pride and the arbitrary exercise of miraculous power was a subtler and less transparent, and therefore more powerful one than the temptation to fall down and recognize the power of evil. * * * The consideration that St. {48} Matthew, as one of the Apostles, is more likely to have heard the narrative immediately from the lips of Christ--gives greater weight to the order which he adopts.--Canon Farrar.  2. More than Three Temptations.--The positive temptations of Jesus were not confined to that particular point of time when they assailed him with concentrated force. [In the wilderness.] * * * But still more frequently in after life was he called to endure temptation of another kind--the temptation of suffering, and this culminated on two occasions, viz., in the conflict of Gethsemane, and in that moment of agony on the cross when he cried, \"_My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?\"_--Ullman.  3. Manner of Christ's Teaching.--Next to what our Savior taught, may be considered the manner of his teaching, which was extremely peculiar; yet, I think, precisely adapted to the peculiarity of his character and situation. His lessons did not consist of disquisitions; of anything like moral essays, or like sermons, or like set treatises upon several points which he mentioned. When he delivered a precept, it was seldom that he added any proof or argument, still more seldom that he accompanied it with, what all precepts require, limitations and distinctions. His instructions were conceived in short, emphatic, sententious rules, in occasional reflections or in sound maxims. I do not think this is a natural, or would it have been a proper method for a philosopher or a moralist or that it is a method which can be successfully imitated by us. But I contend that it was suitable to the character which Christ assumed, and to the situation in which, as a teacher, he was placed. He produced himself as a messenger from God. He put the truth of what he taught upon authority. [I say unto you, swear not at all; I say unto you, resist not evil; I say unto you, love your enemies.] In the choice, therefore, of his mode of teaching, the purpose by him to be consulted was _impression_; because conviction, which forms the principal end of our discourse, was to arise in the minds of his followers from a different source, from their respect to his person and authority. Now, for the purpose of impression singly and exclusively, I know nothing which would have so great force, as strong, ponderous maxims, frequently urged and frequently brought back to the thoughts of the hearers. I know nothing that could in this view be said better than, Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you; The first and great commandment is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.--Christian Evidences--Paley.  4. The Law Added to the Gospel.--The Mosaic Law never was considered, by those who understood it, \"an everlasting covenant.\" It was given for a special purpose, and when it had accomplished that purpose, it was laid aside. We read in Galatians iii:8, that \"the scripture, {49} foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\" From this it appears that the gospel was preached unto Abraham. In Hebrews (iv:2), Paul speaking of ancient Israel says: \"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them [ancient Israel]: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.\" Not only then was the gospel preached unto Abraham, but also unto the children of Israel. Now let us go back to the third chapter of Galatians; for Paul having stated that the gospel was preached unto Abraham, asks this question (ve"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5241"],["title","The Eye of Zeitoon (#0)"],["body","EYE OF ZEITOON  By Talbot Mundy  Author of  Rung Ho,  King--of the Khyber Rifles,  Hira Singh, The Ivory Trail, etc.   CONTENTS  Chapter                                                      Page  I  Parthians, Medes and Elamites .............................. 1 II  \"How did sunshine get into the garden?

Oh ye, who tread the trodden path And keep the narrow law In famished faith that Judgment Day Shall blast your sluggard mists away And show what Moses saw! Oh thralls of subdivided time, Hours Measureless I sing That own swift ways to wider scenes, New-plucked from heights where Vision preens A white, unwearied wing! No creed I preach to bend dull thought To see what I shall show, Nor can ye buy with treasured gold The key to these Hours that unfold New tales no teachers know. Ye'll need no leave o' the laws o' man, For Vision's wings are free; The swift Unmeasured Hours are kind And ye shall leave all cares behind If ye will come with me! In vain shall lumps of fashioned stuff Imprison you about; In vain let pundits preach the flesh And feebling limits that enmesh Your goings in and out, I know the way the zephyrs took Who brought the breath of spring, I guide to shores of regions blest Where white, uncaught Ideas nest And Thought is strong o' wing! Within the Hours that I unlock All customed fetters fall; The chains of drudgery release; Set limits fade; horizons cease For you who hear the call No trumpet note--no roll of drums, But quiet, sure and sweet-- The self-same voice that summoned Drake, The whisper for whose siren sake They manned the Devon fleet, More lawless than the gray gull's wait, More boundless than the sea, More subtle than the softest wind!   * * * * * *  Oh, ye shall burst the ties that bind If ye will come with me!   It is written with authority of Tarsus that once it was no mean city, but that is a tale of nineteen centuries ago.  The Turko-Italian War had not been fought when Fred Oakes took the fever of the place, although the stage was pretty nearly set for it and most of the leading actors were waiting for their cue.  No more history was needed than to grind away forgotten loveliness.  Fred's is the least sweet temper in the universe when the ague grips and shakes him, and he knows history as some men know the Bible--by fathoms;  he cursed the place conqueror by conqueror, maligning them for their city's sake, and if Sennacherib, who built the first foundations, and if Anthony and Cleopatra, Philip of Macedon, Timour-i-lang, Mahmoud, Ibrahim and all the rest of them could have come and listened by his bedside they would have heard more personal scandal of themselves than ever their contemporary chroniclers dared reveal.  All this because he insisted on ignoring the history he knew so well, and could not be held from bathing in the River Cydnus. Whatever their indifference to custom, Anthony and Cleopatra knew better than do that.  Alexander the Great, on the other hand, flouted tradition and set Fred the example, very nearly dying of the ague for his pains, for those are treacherous, chill waters.  Fred, being a sober man and unlike Alexander of Macedon in several other ways, throws off fever marvelously, but takes it as some persons do religion, very severely for a little while.  So we carried him and laid him on a nice white cot in a nice clean room with two beds in it in the American mission, where they dispense more than royal hospitality to utter strangers.  Will Yerkes had friends there but that made no difference;  Fred was quinined, low-dieted, bathed, comforted and reproved for swearing by a college-educated nurse, who liked his principles and disapproved of his professions just as frankly as if he came from her hometown.  (Her name was Van-something-or-other, and you could lean against the Boston accent--just a little lonely-sounding, but a very rock of gentle independence, all that long way from home!)  Meanwhile, we rested.  That is to say that, after accepting as much mission hospitality as was decent, considering that every member of the staff worked fourteen hours a day and had to make up for attention shown to us by long hours bitten out of night, we loafed about the city.  And Satan still finds mischief.  We called on Fred in the beginning twice a day, morning and evening, but cut the visits short for the same reason that Monty did not go at all:  when the fever is on him Fred's feelings toward his own sex are simply blunt bellicose.  When they put another patient in the spare bed in his room we copied Monty, arguing that one male at a time for him to quarrel with was plenty.  Monty, being Earl of Montdidier and Kirkudbrightshire, and a privy councilor, was welcome at the consulate at Mersina, twenty miles away.  The consul, like Monty, was an army officer, who played good chess, so that that was no place, either, for Will Yerkes and me.  Will prefers dime novels, if he must sit still, and there was none.  And besides, he was never what you could call really sedative.  He and I took up quarters at the European hotel--no sweet abiding-place. There were beetles in the Denmark butter that they pushed on to the filthy table-cloth in its original one-pound tin;  and there was a Turkish officer in riding pants and red morocco slippers, back from the Yemen with two or three incurable complaints.  He talked out-of-date Turkish politics in bad French and eked out his ignorance of table manners with instinctive racial habit.  To avoid him between meals Will and I set out to look at the historic sights, and exhausted them all, real and alleged, in less than half a day (for in addition to a lust for ready-cut building stone the Turks have never cherished monuments that might accentuate their own decadence).  After that we fossicked in the manner of prospectors that we are by preference, if not always by trade, eschewing polite society and hunting in the impolite, amusing places where most of the facts have teeth, sharp and ready to snap, but visible.  We found a khan at last on the outskirts of the city, almost in sight of the railway line, that well agreed with our frame of mind.  It was none of the newfangled, underdone affairs that ape hotels, with Greek managers and as many different prices for one service as there are grades of credulity, but a genuine two-hundred-year-old Turkish place, run by a Turk, and named Yeni Khan (which means the new rest house) in proof that once the world was younger.  The man who directed us to the place called it a kahveh;  but that means a place for donkeys and foot-passengers, and when we spoke of it as kahveh to the obadashi--the elderly youth who corresponds to porter, bell-boy and chambermaid in one--he was visibly annoyed.  Truly the place was a khan--a great bleak building of four high outer walls, surrounding a courtyard that was a yard deep with the dung of countless camels, horses, bullocks, asses;  crowded with arabas, the four-wheeled vehicles of all the Near East, and smelly with centuries of human journeys' ends.  Khans provide nothing except room, heat and water (and the heat costs extra);  there is no sanitation for any one at any price;  every guest dumps all his discarded rubbish over the balcony rail into the courtyard, to be trodden and wheeled under foot and help build the aroma.  But the guests provide a picture without price that with the very first glimpse drives discomfort out of mind.  In that place there were Parthians, Medes and Elamites, and all the rest of the list.  There was even a Chinaman.  Two Hindus were unpacking bundles out of a creaking araba, watched scornfully by an unmistakable Pathan.  A fat swarthy-faced Greek in black frock coat and trousers, fez, and slippered feet gesticulated with his right arm like a pump-handle while he sat on the balcony-rail and bellowed orders to a crowd mixed of Armenians, Italians, Maltese, Syrians and a Turk or two, who labored with his bales of cotton goods below.  (The Italians eyed everybody sidewise, for there were rumors in those days of impending trouble, and when the Turk begins hostilities he likes his first opponents easy and ready to hand.)  There were Kurds, long-nosed, lean-lipped and suspicious, who said very little, but hugged long knives as they passed back and forth among the swarming strangers.  They said nothing at all, those Kurds, but listened a very great deal.  Tall, mustached Circassians, with eighteen-inch Erzerum"]]]
