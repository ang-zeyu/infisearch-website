If the ball has any peculiar feature, as a        masquerade or costume, the invitation should        have some words to that effect in the lower        left hand corner--as, Costume of the XVIIth        Century, Bal Masque, or Bal Poudre.    INVITATIONS ASKED FOR STRANGERS. If a        hostess receives a request from friends for        invitations for friends of theirs, she can properly        refuse all such requests, and no friend        should feel aggrieved at a refusal for what        she has no right to ask and which the hostess        is under no obligation to give. If the        hostess chooses to grant the request, well and        good.         She would naturally do so when the request        is for a near relative, or the betrothed of the        one making the request.         A man should never ask for an invitation        to a ball for another person, except for his        fiancee or a near relative.         A woman may ask for an invitation for her        fiance, a brother, or a male friend of long        standing, or for a visiting friend. She should        take care that she does not ask it for some        one known to the hostess and whom the latter        does not desire to invite. No offense should be        felt at a refusal save, possibly, in the case of a        brother, sister, or fiance.    INVITATIONS GIVEN BY A NEWCOMER. When a        newcomer in a neighborhood desires to give        a ball but has no visiting list, it is allowable        for her to borrow the visiting list of        some friend. The friend, however, arranges        that in each envelope is placed a calling-card        of her own, so that the invited ones may know        that she is acting as sponsor for the newcomer.    INVITATIONS ANSWERED. Every invitation        should be answered as soon as possible, and        in the third person if the invitation was in the        third person. The answer should be sent to        the party requesting the pleasure, even if        many names are on the invitation.         When a subscriber to a subscription ball        invites a friend who is a non-subscriber, she        encloses her card in the envelope, and the invited        friend sends the answer to the subscriber        sending the invitation.    INTRODUCTIONS. When a man is introduced to a        woman at a ball, he should ask her for a        dance.    MEN AT. Courtesy toward his hostess and consideration        for his friends demands that a        man who can dance should do so.         To accept an invitation to a ball and then        refuse to dance shows that a man is lacking        in good breeding.         A man finding few friends at a ball should        ask some friend, or the hostess, to introduce        him to some women whom he can invite to        dance.         It is an act of discourtesy for a man not to        request a dance of a woman to whom he has        been introduced.         A man escorting a woman to a ball should        agree where to meet her after they have each        left their wraps at the dressing-rooms. It        may be at the foot of the stairway or near        the ball-room door.         It is now no longer customary for the man        and woman to enter arm in arm, but for the        woman to precede the man, and together        they greet the hostess. It is for the hostess        to merely bow or to shake hands, and the        guests follow her lead.         A man should see that his companion's        chaperone is comfortably seated, and then        ask his companion for a couple of dances,        and, with her permission, introduce other        young men, who should ask her to dance.        Such permission is not usually asked if the        man is her fiance, a near relative, or an old        friend.         It is strictly the woman's prerogative to decide        to retire, and no man should urge or        hint to a woman to retire earlier than she        wishes.    MEN--CARRIAGE. A man asking a woman to        accompany him to a ball should call in a carriage        for her and her chaperone.    MEN--DRESS. Men wear full evening dress in        summer or winter, city and town.         Gloves of white dressed kid should be worn        at all balls.    NEWCOMERS. See BALLS-INVITATIONS GIVEN BY        NEWCOMERS.     PATRONESSES. See PUBLIC BALLS--PATRONESSES.    TIPPING SERVANTS. Only at public balls is it        customary to give a tip to the men and        women in charge of the cloak-room.    SUPPER. Usually a buffet supper, being more        easily handled and arranged for. Supper at        tables requires many servants, much preparation,        and great care.    WOMEN AT. A mother should attend balls with        her daughters, going and returning with        them, and if she is not invited, they should        decline the invitation. The father can act        as escort if need be.         After greeting the hostess and guests, the        guests pay their respects to the head of the        house if he is present.         Taking leave of the hostess is unnecessary.         It is no longer customary for a couple to        enter arm in arm, but for the woman to precede        the man. A mother, elder sister, or        married woman takes the precedence over        a daughter, younger sister, or unmarried        woman.         If not at once asked to dance, a young        woman should take a seat by her chaperone.        It is bad taste to refuse a dance with one        man and then to dance that same dance with        another.         Both the hostess and the women wear their        most elaborate costume for such an entertainment-        decollete, short-sleeved, and a long train.         For a less elaborate affair the costume        may be plainer.    BALLS, ASSEMBLY. See ASSEMBLY BALLS.    BALLS, COSTUME. See COSTUME BALLS.    BALLS, DEBUT. See DEBUT BALLS.    BALLS, PUBLIC.

Small pieces should be cut or        broken off, and taken in the fingers, or they        may be cut up and eaten with a fork.    BARON-HOW ADDRESSED.

The best man is usually a bachelor, but        may be a married man or a widower, and is        selected by the groom. He fills an important        position, requiring tact, administrative        ability, and capacity to handle details. He        acts as the groom's representative, confidential        advisor, and business advisor.         After his selection he should send a gift to        the bride, and may, if he wish, send it to the        groom-a custom not yet clearly established,        and one not to be either encouraged or followed        with safety.         On the morning of the wedding-day he        should have received both the ring and fee        from the groom, and should personally see to        the church and other details.         He breakfasts with the groom, and together        they drive to the church.    CALLS. He should call on the bride's mother        within two weeks after the ceremony, and        also on the married couple upon their return        from their wedding trip.    CHURCH. He accompanies the groom into the        chancel, and stands by his side till the bride        appears, when he receives the groom's hat        and gloves, and stands a little way behind        him. When the clergyman bids the bride        and groom join hands, he gives the ring to        to the groom.         At the conclusion of the ceremony, he        gives the wedding fee to the clergyman, and        hastily leaves the church to summon the        groom's carriage and to return him his        hat. He signs the register, if a witness is        needed.         It is a better arrangement to have the        groom and the best man enter the church        without their hats, and have the latter sent        from the vestry to the church door, so that the        groom may receive his when he leaves the        church.         Especially is this a good arrangement if        the best man has to walk with the maid of        honor down the aisle.         After this, he hastens in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#4)"],["body","own carriage        to the bride's home, to assist in meeting and        introducing the guests at the reception or        breakfast.    DRESS. If the bride presents the best man with        the boutonniere, he should go to her house        on the wedding-day to have her put it in the        lapel of his coat.         He should dress as nearly as possible like the        groom-wearing afternoon dress at an afternoon        wedding, and at an evening wedding        evening dress.           See also GROOM-DRESS.    EXPENSES. The best man is the guest of the        groom, and in matters of expense this should        be borne in mind.    REPORTERS. If such is the wish of the family        of the bride, the best man attends to the reporters,        and furnishes them with the names        of groom, bride, relatives, friends, description        of gowns, and other details deemed        suitable for publication.    WEDDING BREAKFAST. The best man escorts        the maid of honor, and they are usually        seated at the bridal table.    WEDDING RECEPTION. The best man stands        with the married couple, and is introduced        to the guests.    WEDDING TRIP. He should arrange beforehand        all details of the trip-as to tickets, parlor-car,        flowers, baggage, etc. He alone knows the        point of destination, and is in honor bound        not to betray it, save in case of emergencies.        He should see that the married couple        leave the house without any trouble, and if        the station is near, he should go in a separate        carriage (provided by the groom) to personally        attend to all details. He is the last        one to see the married couple, and should return        to the house to give their last message        to the parents.    BEST WISHES TO BRIDE. One should give best wishes        to the bride and congratulations to the        groom.    BICYCLING. A man bicycling with a woman should        extend to her all the courtesies practised        when riding or driving with her, such as        allowing her to set the pace, taking the lead        on unfamiliar roads and in dangerous        places, riding on the side nearest obstacles,        etc.    MEN--DRESS. A man should wear the regulation        suit coat, waistcoat, and knickerbockers        of gray or brown tweed, avoiding all        eccentricities of personal taste.    BIRTH (Announcement). If wishing to send congratulations        after a birth, cards should be left in        person or sent by a messenger. Cut flowers        may be sent with the card.    BISHOP OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH--HOW ADDRESSED.        An official letter begins: My Lord, and ends:        I have the honor to remain your Lordship's        most obedient servant.         A social letter begins: My Dear Lord        Bishop, and ends: I have the honor to remain,        my Dear Lord Bishop, faithfully yours.         The address on the envelope: To the Right        Rev. The Lord Bishop of Kent.    BISHOP (PROTESTANT)-HOW ADDRESSED. An official        letter begins: Right Reverend and Dear Sir,        and ends: I have the honor to remain your        obedient servant.         A social letter begins: Dear  Bishop Wilson,        and ends: I remain sincerely yours.         The address on the envelope is: To the        Right Reverend John J. Wilson, Bishop of,        Montana.    BISHOP (ROMAN CATHOLIC)--HOW ADDRESSED. An        official or social letter begins. Right Reverend        and Dear Sir, and ends: I have the honor        to remain your humble servant.         The address on the envelope is: To the        Right Reverend John J. Wilson, Bishop of        Ohio.    BONNETS (THEATRE). A woman of any consideration        should either wear no bonnet or remove it        when the curtain rises.         It would be in place for a man or a woman        to politely request a woman whose bonnet        obstructs the view to remove it, and, after        it was done, to thank the woman for so        doing.    BOUQUETS (WEDDING). The bouquet carried by the        bride is furnished by the groom, who should        also provide bouquets for the bridesmaids.    BOWING    MEN, When leaving a woman at the door of        her house, he bows and retires as the door        is opened.         When seeing a woman to her carriage, he        should raise his hat on closing the door.         On a railroad a man removes his hat in a        parlor-car, but not in a day coach.         In street-cars a man should raise his hat        when giving his seat to a woman; also when        rendering a service to a woman in public, in        answering a question, or in apologizing to a        woman.         In elevators, when women are present,        the hat should be removed.         In hotel halls or corridors a man passing        a woman should raise his hat.         Men do not raise their hats to one another,        save out of deference to an elderly person, a        person of note, or a clergyman.         In driving, if impossible to raise the hat,        he should touch it with his whip.         The hat is gracefully lifted from the head,        brought to the level of the chest, and the        body inclined forward, and then replaced in        passing.         It is the woman's privilege to bow first if        it is a mere acquaintance. If, however, a        woman bows, and the man fails to recognize        her, he should bow in return.         A man may bow first to a very intimate        friend.         Meeting a woman to whom he has been        introduced at an entertainment, he should        wait until she bows first.         After bowing to a woman, the man may        join her, and with her permission may walk        a short distance with her.         He should not stand in the street and converse        with her any length of time. She may        excuse herself and pass on. He should not        feel affronted.         If he meets a woman he does not know        accompanied by a man he does know, both        men bow.         The man accompanying her should bow        to every man or woman to whom she bows.    WOMEN. A woman's bow should be dignified--        a faint smile and a gentle inclination of the        head.         Women bow first to men when meeting in        the street. A man may bow first if the        acquaintance is intimate.         When walking with a man, and they meet        another unknown to her, but known to her        escort, both men bow. If she meets a friend,        man or woman, unknown to her escort, he        bows.         Unless an introduction has taken place at        any function, no recognition is customary.        It is the woman's privilege, however, to decide        for herself whether she will recognize        the guest or not.         A man bowing and joining a woman on        the street must ask permission to do so.        She is at perfect liberty to gracefully decline.         If a man stops to talk on the street, she        may excuse herself and pass on. If she        continues the conversation and he stands        with his hat in his hand, she may request        him to replace it. Such conversations should        be brief.    BREAD should be broken into small pieces, buttered,        and transferred with the fingers to the mouth.        The bread should be placed on the small        plate provided for the purpose.    BREAKFASTS. Breakfasts are generally given from        ten to twelve in the morning. Very formal        breakfasts are held at twelve o'clock.    CALLS. A call need not be made after a simple        breakfast, but obligatory after a formal one.    DRESS. Street costumes are worn by men and        women.    GUESTS. Guests leave half an hour after the        breakfast.    HOURS. The hour is from 12 to 12.30.    INVITATIONS. Cards are engraved and sent a        week in advance for formal breakfasts, but        for informal breakfasts they may be written.        If given in honor of a special guest, the        name is engraved on the card--as, TO MEET        MR. WILSON.    MEN. Men are usually invited, and they are        often given for men. Men wear street costume.         Guests should leave half an hour after        breakfast. A call is not necessary after a        simple breakfast, but obligatory after a formal        one.    MEN LEAVING CARDS. After a breakfast a man        should leave a card for host and hostess,        whether the invitation was accepted or not.        Or it may be sent by mail or messenger, with        an apology for so doing.    WOMEN. Women wear street costume, including        gloves, the latter being taken off at table.        Women remove their coats and wraps, but        not bonnets.         Guests should leave half an hour after        breakfast. A call is not necessary after a        simple breakfast, but obligatory after a formal        one.    WEDDING. See WEDDING RECEPTIONS OR BREAKFASTS.    BREAKING DINNER ENGAGEMENTS. When it is absolutely        necessary to break an engagement made for        a dinner, a letter should be sent as soon as        possible to the hostess, either by special delivery        or messenger, giving the reason and        expressing regrets.    BRIDE. The bride selects the church and the clergyman,        and can, if she wishes, ask the latter        personally or by note to perform the ceremony.        She selects the music for the ceremony        and the organist, names the wedding        day, and selects the ushers and the bridesmaids.        Of the bridesmaids, she may select        one, some near friend, as the maid of honor,        to act for her, as the best man does for the        groom.         She further designates one of the ushers to        be master of ceremonies, and should instruct        him minutely as to the details she desires        carried out-how the wedding party shall enter        the church, proceed up the aisle, etc.         A few days"]]]
