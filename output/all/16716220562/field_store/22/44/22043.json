Business and professional men may call between        eight and nine o'clock, as their obligations        prevent them from observing the fashionable        hours.         Informal calls may be made on Sunday        after three o'clock by business and professional        men, provided there are no religious or other        scruples on the part of those receiving the        calls.         A business man may call in street dress        before six o'clock in the evening, or thereafter        if intimacy warrants.         Evening, or other than mere formal calls,        should not be made, save by special invitation.         A man should leave his card when calling.        If his hostess is married, he should leave        one also for the host. If she is out, he        should leave two.         When calling upon a young woman whose        hostess is not known to the man, he should        send his card to her.         If the woman is seated when a man enters        the room, she rises to greet him, and, if        she wishes, shakes hands. It is her option        to shake hands or not, and she should make        the first advances. It is bad form for him        to do so.         During a formal call, when other guests        are present, a man should remain standing        and depart upon the entrance of others. If        the hostess is seated at the time, she need not        rise or shake hands, but merely bow.         The hostess should not accompany a caller        to the door of the parlor, but bow from her        chair.         Dropping in at a theatre or opera party        does not relieve a man from making formal        calls that may be due.         A woman's escort to a theatre party should        call upon her within a week. If she were        his guest, he should do so within three days,        or send his card, with an apology.         Business calls are privileged, and can be        made when convenient, although preferably        by appointment.    WOMEN RECEIVING--INTRODUCTIONS. At formal        calls conversation should be general among        the guests. Introductions are unnecessary.    AFTERNOON. See AFTERNOON CALLS.    COUNTRY. See COUNTRY CALLS.    EVENING. See EVENING CALLS.    FIRST. See FIRST CALLS.    INVALID'S. See INVALID'S CALLS.    SUNDAY. See SUNDAY CALLS.    CANCELING DINNERS. When it becomes necessary for        a hostess to cancel or postpone a dinner, she        should send as soon as possible, either by        special delivery or messenger, a letter to each        guest who has accepted the invitation. The        letter, written either in the first or third person,        should state the reason and express        regrets.    CANCELING WEDDINGS. See WEDDINGS-INVITATIONS RECALLED.    CANES. A cane is the correct thing for a man when        walking, except when engaged in business.        It should be held a few inches below the        knob, ferrule down, and should, like umbrellas,        be carried vertically.    CALLING. When making a formal or brief call     the cane should be left in the hall.    CARDINAL-HOW ADDRESSED. A letter, official or        social, begins: Your Eminence, and ends: I        have the honor to remain your humble servant.        The address on the envelope is: His Eminence        Cardinal Wilson.    CARDS.    DEBUT. See DEBUT CARDS.    DEBUTANTS. See DEBUTANTE CARDS.    INFANT. See INFANT'S CARDS.    IN MEMORIAM.

HUSBAND AND WIFE. When the wife is calling,        she can leave cards of the husband and        sons if it is impossible for them to do so        themselves.         After an entertainment, cards of the family        can be left for the host and hostess by either        the wife or any of the daughters.        See Also MR. AND MRS. CARD.    LEAVING IN PERSON. When cards with a message        of congratulation are left in person,        nothing should be written on it.    LEAVING IN PERSON--AFTERNOON TEAS.        Women leave cards of their male relatives        as well as their own, although their names        may be announced upon entering the drawing-room.        Guests leave their cards in a receptacle        provided, or give them to the servant        at the door.    MEN. A bachelor should not use AT HOME        cards as a woman does, nor to invite his        friends by writing a date and MUSIC AT FOUR        on his calling card in place of an invitation.    MEN--LEAVING IN PERSON. When returning        to town after a long absence, a man should        leave cards having his address.         When calling upon a young woman whose        hostess is not known by the man, he should        send his card to her.         At the beginning of a season, a man should        leave two cards for all those whose entertainments        he is in the habit of attending, or on        whom he pays social calls. These cards        may also be mailed. If left in person, there        should be one for each member of the family        called upon, or only two cards. In the        former there should be left one card for the        host, one for the hostess, one for the        \"misses,\" and one for the rest of the family        and their guest.         Men of leisure should leave their own        cards, while business men can have them        left by the women of the family.         The corner of the card should not be        turned down.         Cards are now left in the hall by the servant        and the caller is announced. In business        calls the card is taken to the person for        whom the caller asked.         When calling, a man should leave a card        whether the hostess is at home or not.         P. P. C. card's may be left in person or        sent by mail upon departure from city, or        on leaving winter or summer resort.         When a man calls upon a young woman        whom a hostess is entertaining, he should        leave cards for both.         When a man calls upon another man, if he        is not at home, he should leave a card.         When a man calls on the hostess but not        the host he should leave a card for him.        If the hostess is out, he should leave two        cards--one for each.    BREAKFASTS, LUNCHEONS, DINNERS.  A man        should leave a card the day after a breakfast,        luncheon, or dinner for the host and hostess,        whether the invitation was accepted or not.        They may also be sent by mail or messenger,        with an apology for so doing.    BALLS, SUBSCRIPTION.  Shortly after receiving        an invitation to a subscription ball, a man        should leave a card for the patroness inviting        him.    DEBUTANTE.  When calling upon a debutante a        man should leave cards for her mother,        whether the entertainment was attended or        not.    ENTERTAINMENT BY MEN.  After a man's formal        entertainment for men, a man should leave a        card within one week, whether the event was        attended or not. It can be sent by mail or        messenger.    RECEPTION.  When the host and hostess receive        together, a man should leave one card for        both, and if not present at the reception, he        should send two cards.    THEATRE.  After a theatre party given by a        man, he should call within three days on the        woman he escorted or leave his card.    WEDDING RECEPTION.  After a wedding reception        a man should leave a card for the host        and hostess, and another for the bridal        couple.           If a man has been invited to the church        but not to the wedding reception, he should        leave a card for the bride's parents and the        bridal couple, or should mail a card.    SENDING BY MAIL, OR MESSENGER. After an        entertainment a man should call in person on        host and hostess, whether the invitation was        accepted or not. If a card is mailed or sent,        it should be accompanied with an apology.           At the beginning of the season a man        should leave cards for all those whose entertainments        he is in the habit of attending, or        on whom he pays social calls. These cards        may also be mailed. If left in person, there        should be one for each member of the household        or only two cards.         In the former case, there should be left one        card for the host, one for the hostess, one for        the \"misses,\" and one for the rest of the        family and the guest.         If a man is unable to make a formal call        upon a debutante and her mother at her        debut, he should send his card by mail or        messenger.         A man may mail his card to a woman        engaged to be married, if acquaintance        warrants.         Visitors to town should send cards to every        one whom they desire to see. The address        should be written on them.    AFTERNOON TEA. If a man is unable to be        present at an afternoon tea, he should send a        card the same afternoon.

ENTERTAINMENT BY MEN."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#8)"],["body","a man's formal        entertainment for men, a man should leave a        card within one week, whether the event was        attended or not. It can be sent by mail or        messenger.         P. P. C. cards may be sent by mail or messenger         upon departure from city, or on leaving          winter or summer resort.    RECEPTION. When the host and hostess receive        together, a man should leave one card for        both, and, if not present at the reception, he        should send two cards.    WEDDING RECEPTION. If a man has been invited         to the church but not the wedding        reception, he should leave or mail a card to        the bride's parents, and also to the bridal        couple.    STYLE.   The full name should be used, and if        too long, the initials only. The club address        is put in the lower left-hand corner, and if        not living at a club, the home address should        be in lower right-hand corner. In the absence        of a title, Mr. is always used on an        engraved but not a written card.         Cards should be engraved in plain letter,        according to prevailing fashion.         Facsimile cards engraved are no longer        used.         Written cards are in bad taste, but in case        of necessity they may be used. The name        should be written in full if not too long, and        should be the autograph of the sender.         Messages or writing should not appear on        men's cards. If address is changed, new        cards should be engraved. In an emergency        only the new address may be written.    MOURNING CARDS are the same size as visiting-        cards, and a black border is used--the width        to be regulated by the relationship of the        deceased relative.    MEN--STYLE, TITLES. Men having titles use        them before their names--as, Reverend, Rev.,        Mr., Dr., Army and Navy titles, and officers        on retired list. L.L.D. and all professional        titles are placed after the name. Political        and judicial titles are always omitted.         Physicians may use Dr. before or M.D.        after the name. On cards intended for social        use, office hours and other professional        matter are omitted.    MR. AND MRS. See MR. AND MRS. CARDS.    P. P. C. See P. P. C. CARDS.    SENDING BY MAIL OR MESSENGER. If after        accepting an invitation it is necessary to        decline, a card should be sent the evening of        the entertainment, with an explanatory note        the day following.         When an invitation has been received to        an \"At Home\" debut, and one has not been        able to attend, cards should be sent by mail        or messenger, to arrive at the time of the        ceremony.         A card should be mailed to a man engaged        to be married.    AFTERNOON TEAS. The invitations to a formal        afternoon tea are sent a week or ten days in        advance by mail or messenger. No reply is        necessary, but if unable to be present, a card        should be sent the day of the entertainment.         For an afternoon tea a visiting-card may        be used, with the hour for the \"tea\" written        or engraved over the date beneath the fixed        day of that week. They may be sent by mail        or messenger.         Persons unable to attend should send cards        the same afternoon.    BIRTH (ANNOUNCEMENT). If wishing to congratulate        after a birth, cards should be left in        person or sent by a messenger. Cut flowers        may be sent with the card.    CONDOLENCE. After a death in the family of        an acquaintance, a card with the word        Condolence written on it should be left in person or        by messenger. For very intimate acquaintances,        cut flowers may be left in person or        sent, together with a card or letter.         When unable to leave in person a card        with Condolence written on it, send it to intimate        friends only with a note of apology. If        out of town, it should be sent with a letter of        condolence.    TRAVELERS. A woman visiting a place for a        length of time should mail to her friends a        visiting-card which contains her temporary        address.         A man in similar situation should call upon        his friends, and if he does not find them at        home, should leave his card.    WEDDING INVITATIONS. Those present at the        ceremony should leave cards for those inviting        them, and if this is not possible, they can        be sent by mail or messenger.         Those invited but not present should send        cards.    WIDOW. See WIDOWS--CARDS.    WIFE. Only the wife of the oldest member of        the oldest branch may use her husband's        name without the initials.    WOMEN. Mrs. or Miss should always be used        before the names. The cards of single        women are smaller than those of married        women.         The husband's name should be used in        full, unless too long, when the initials are        used. Only the wife of the oldest member        of the oldest branch may use her husband's        name without initials.         Reception days should appear in the lower        left-hand corner, limiting dates--as, Until        Lent, or in January, may be either engraved        or written.         If a special function is allotted to any        reception days--as, the entertaining of special        guests--the hour of the reception day may be        written above the day and the date beneath it.    DAUGHTERS. See DAUGHTERS--CARDS.    LEAVING IN PERSON--BIRTH, ANNOUNCEMENT OF.        If wishing to send congratulations,        after receipt of a birth announcement card,        cards should be left in person or sent by a        messenger; cut flowers may be sent with the        card.         Before the wedding cards are issued, an        engaged woman should leave her card        personally upon her friends without entering the        house.         When calling at the beginning of the season        a woman should leave her own card,        those of the men of the family, and two of        her husband's.         After formal invitations, a woman should        leave her own card and those of the men of        the family who were invited, whether they        attended or not.         When calling formally a woman should        leave a card, whether the hostess is at home        or not.         When a woman calls upon a well-known        friend, it is not necessary to send up a card.         When making a call at a hotel or other        public place, the name of the person called        upon should be written in the upper left-        hand corner of the card--as:         For Mrs. Jane Wilson         The corner of the card should not be        turned down.         P. P. C. cards may be left in person or        sent by mail upon departure from city, or        on leaving winter or summer resort.         The corner of the card should not be        turned down.    RECEPTION. At receptions a woman should        leave the cards in the hall or hand them to        the servant.         At a \"coming-out reception\" a woman        should leave cards for the mother and        daughter.         A married man returns his social obligations        to women by personal calls, or his wife        can do it for him by leaving his card with        her own.    MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. After her debut the        younger of the two daughters has no card of        her own, as her full baptismal name appears        on her mother's card beneath her name. A        year after her first appearance she may have        a card of her own.         When a mother leaves her daughter's card,        it is for the hostess only.         If reception day appear on the mother's        card, the daughters also receive on that date,        as the daughters have no reception days of        their own.    MOTHER AND SON. When a mother is calling,        she can leave cards of her son for the host        and hostess if it is impossible for him to do so        himself.         A son entering society can have his cards        left by his mother upon a host and hostess.        Invitations to entertainments will follow.    RETURNING TO TOWN. Cards of the entire        family should be sent by mail to all        acquaintances when returning after a        prolonged absence.         When using cards, if out of town, the        place of a woman's permanent residence can        be written on the card--thus: New York.        Philadelphia.    SENDING BY MAIL OR MESSENGER. A woman        visiting a place for a length of time should        mail to her friends her visiting-card        containing her temporary address.         P. P. C. cards may be sent by mail or        messenger upon departure from city, or        on leaving winter or summer resort.         After a change of residence the cards of        the entire family should be sent out as soon        as possible.         At the beginning of the season both married        and single women should send their cards        to all their acquaintances.         Visitors to town should send cards to every        one whom they desire to see, with the address        written on the cards.         For afternoon tea a visiting-card may be        used. The hour for the tea is written or        engraved over, and the date beneath the fixed        day of the week. They may be sent by mail        or messenger.         The cards of a debutante may be sent by        mail or messenger.         Mourning cards should be sent to indicate        temporary retirement from society. Later        cards should be sent to indicate return to        society.    AFTERNOON TEA. If a woman is unable to be        present at an afternoon tea she should send        her card the same afternoon.    WEDDING RECEPTION. When invitations have        been received to the church but not to the        wedding reception,"]]]
