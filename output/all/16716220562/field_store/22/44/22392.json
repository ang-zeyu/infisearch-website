I should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends. I am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise.”  “Very good,” said Dick.  Here the stranger left the table, and walked up to the desk to settle his bill.  “You see what it is to be a man of fortun’, Frank,” said Dick, “and wear good clothes. I wonder what that chap’ll say when he sees me blackin’ boots to-morrow in the street?”  “Perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does, after all,” said Frank. “Some of these mining companies are nothing but swindles, got up to cheat people out of their money.”  “He’s welcome to all he gets out of me,” said Dick.     CHAPTER VI. UP BROADWAY TO MADISON SQUARE   As the boys pursued their way up Broadway, Dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement. Frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan Hotels, the former of white marble, the latter of a subdued brown hue, but not less elegant in its internal appointments. He was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars.  At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right, and pointed out the Clinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library, comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes.*  * Now not far from one hundred thousand.   A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues, and with one side on each.  “What is that building?” asked Frank.  “That’s the Cooper Institute,” said Dick; “built by Mr. Cooper, a particular friend of mine. Me and Peter Cooper used to go to school together.”  “What is there inside?” asked Frank.  “There’s a hall for public meetin’s and lectures in the basement, and a readin’ room and a picture gallery up above,” said Dick.  Directly opposite Cooper Institute, Frank saw a very large building of brick, covering about an acre of ground.  “Is that a hotel?” he asked.  “No,” said Dick; “that’s the Bible House. It’s the place where they make Bibles. I was in there once,—saw a big pile of ’em.”  “Did you ever read the Bible?” asked Frank, who had some idea of the neglected state of Dick’s education.  “No,” said Dick; “I’ve heard it’s a good book, but I never read one. I aint much on readin’. It makes my head ache.”  “I suppose you can’t read very fast.”  “I can read the little words pretty well, but the big ones is what stick me.”  “If I lived in the city, you might come every evening to me, and I would teach you.”  “Would you take so much trouble about me?” asked Dick, earnestly.  “Certainly; I should like to see you getting on. There isn’t much chance of that if you don’t know how to read and write.”  “You’re a good feller,” said Dick, gratefully. “I wish you did live in New York. I’d like to know somethin’. Whereabouts do you live?”  “About fifty miles off, in a town on the left bank of the Hudson. I wish you’d come up and see me sometime. I would like to have you come and stop two or three days.”  “Honor bright?”  “I don’t understand.”  “Do you mean it?” asked Dick, incredulously.  “Of course I do. Why shouldn’t I?”  “What would your folks say if they knowed you asked a boot-black to visit you?”  “You are none the worse for being a boot-black, Dick.”  “I aint used to genteel society,” said Dick. “I shouldn’t know how to behave.”  “Then I could show you. You won’t be a boot-black all your life, you know.”  “No,” said Dick; “I’m goin’ to knock off when I get to be ninety.”  “Before that, I hope,” said Frank, smiling.  “I really wish I could get somethin’ else to do,” said Dick, soberly. “I’d like to be a office boy, and learn business, and grow up ’spectable.”  “Why don’t you try, and see if you can’t get a place, Dick?”  “Who’d take Ragged Dick?”  “But you aint ragged now, Dick.”  “No,” said Dick; “I look a little better than I did in my Washington coat and Louis Napoleon pants. But if I got in a office, they wouldn’t give me more’n three dollars a week, and I couldn’t live ’spectable on that.”  “No, I suppose not,” said Frank, thoughtfully. “But you would get more at the end of the first year.”  “Yes,” said Dick; “but by that time I’d be nothin’ but skin and bones.”  Frank laughed. “That reminds me,” he said, “of the story of an Irishman, who, out of economy, thought he would teach his horse to feed on shavings. So he provided the horse with a pair of green spectacles which made the shavings look eatable. But unfortunately, just as the horse got learned, he up and died.”  “The hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur’ by the time he got through,” remarked Dick.  “Whereabouts are we now?” asked Frank, as they emerged from Fourth Avenue into Union Square.  “That is Union Park,” said Dick, pointing to a beautiful enclosure, in the centre of which was a pond, with a fountain playing.  “Is that the statue of General Washington?” asked Frank, pointing to a bronze equestrian statue, on a granite pedestal.  “Yes,” said Dick; “he’s growed some since he was President. If he’d been as tall as that when he fit in the Revolution, he’d have walloped the Britishers some, I reckon.”  Frank looked up at the statue, which is fourteen and a half feet high, and acknowledged the justice of Dick’s remark.  “How about the coat, Dick?” he asked. “Would it fit you?”  “Well, it might be rather loose,” said Dick, “I aint much more’n ten feet high with my boots off.”  “No, I should think not,” said Frank, smiling. “You’re a queer boy, Dick.”  “Well, I’ve been brought up queer. Some boys is born with a silver spoon in their mouth. Victoria’s boys is born with a gold spoon, set with di’monds; but gold and silver was scarce when I was born, and mine was pewter.”  “Perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by, Dick. Did you ever hear of Dick Whittington?”  “Never did. Was he a Ragged Dick?”  “I shouldn’t wonder if he was. At any rate he was very poor when he was a boy, but he didn’t stay so. Before he died, he became Lord Mayor of London.”  “Did he?” asked Dick, looking interested. “How did he do it?”  “Why, you see, a rich merchant took pity on him, and gave him a home in his own house, where he used to stay with the servants, being employed in little errands. One day the merchant noticed Dick picking up pins and needles that had been dropped, and asked him why he did it. Dick told him he was going to sell them when he got enough. The merchant was pleased with his saving disposition, and when soon after, he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts, he told Dick he might send anything he pleased in it, and it should be sold to his advantage. Now Dick had nothing in the world but a kitten which had been given him a short time before.”  “How much taxes did he have to pay on it?” asked Dick.  “Not very high, probably. But having only the kitten, he concluded to send it along. After sailing a good many months, during which the kitten grew up to be a strong cat, the ship touched at an island never before known, which happened to be infested with rats and mice to such an extent that they worried everybody’s life out, and even ransacked the king’s palace. To make a long story short, the captain, seeing how matters stood, brought Dick’s cat ashore, and she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice, and resolved to have her at any price. So he offered a great quantity of gold for her, which, of course, the captain was glad to accept. It was faithfully carried back to Dick, and laid the foundation of his fortune. He prospered as he grew up, and in time became a very rich merchant, respected by all, and before he died was elected Lord Mayor of London.”  “That’s a pretty good story,” said Dick; “but I don’t believe all the cats in New York will ever make me mayor.”  “No, probably not, but you may rise in some other way. A good many distinguished men have once been poor boys. There’s hope for you, Dick, if you’ll try.”  “Nobody ever talked to me so before,” said Dick. “They just called me Ragged Dick, and told me I’d grow up to be a vagabone (boys who are better educated need not be surprised at Dick’s blunders) and come to the gallows.”  “Telling you so won’t make it turn out so, Dick. If you’ll try to be somebody, and grow up into a respectable member of society, you will. You may not become rich,—it isn’t everybody that becomes rich, you know—but you can obtain a good position, and be respected.”  “I’ll try,” said Dick, earnestly. “I needn’t have been Ragged Dick so long if I hadn’t spent my money in goin’ to the theatre, and treatin’ boys to oyster-stews, and bettin’ money on cards, and such like.”  “Have you lost money that way?”  “Lots of it. One time I saved up five dollars to buy me a new rig-out, cos my best suit was all in rags, when Limpy Jim wanted me to play a game with him.”  “Limpy Jim?” said Frank, interrogatively.  “Yes, he’s lame; that’s what makes us call him Limpy Jim.”  “I suppose you lost?”  “Yes, I lost every penny, and had to sleep out, cos I hadn’t a cent to pay for lodgin’. ’Twas a awful cold night, and I got most froze.”  “Wouldn’t Jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging?”  “No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn’t let me have it.”  “Can you get lodging for five cents?” asked Frank, in surprise.  “Yes,” said Dick, “but not at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. That’s it right out there.”     CHAPTER VII. THE POCKET-BOOK   They had reached the junction of Broadway and of Fifth Avenue. Before them was a beautiful park of ten acres. On the left-hand side was a large marble building, presenting a fine appearance with its extensive white front. This was the building at which Dick pointed.  “Is that the Fifth Avenue Hotel?” asked Frank. “I’ve heard of it often. My Uncle"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5348"],["title","Ragged Dick, Or, Street Life in New York with the Boot-Blacks (#6)"],["body","always stops there when he comes to New York.”  “I once slept on the outside of it,” said Dick. “They was very reasonable in their charges, and told me I might come again.”  “Perhaps sometime you’ll be able to sleep inside,” said Frank.  “I guess that’ll be when Queen Victoria goes to the Five Points to live.”  “It looks like a palace,” said Frank. “The queen needn’t be ashamed to live in such a beautiful building as that.”  Though Frank did not know it, one of the queen’s palaces is far from being as fine a looking building as the Fifth Avenue Hotel. St. James’ Palace is a very ugly-looking brick structure, and appears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty. There are few hotels in the world as fine-looking as this democratic institution.  At that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk, who looked back at Dick, as if his face seemed familiar.  “I know that man,” said Dick, after he had passed. “He’s one of my customers.”  “What is his name?”  “I don’t know.”  “He looked back as if he thought he knew you.”  “He would have knowed me at once if it hadn’t been for my new clothes,” said Dick. “I don’t look much like Ragged Dick now.”  “I suppose your face looked familiar.”  “All but the dirt,” said Dick, laughing. “I don’t always have the chance of washing my face and hands in the Astor House.”  “You told me,” said Frank, “that there was a place where you could get lodging for five cents. Where’s that?”  “It’s the News-boys’ Lodgin’ House, on Fulton Street,” said Dick, “up over the ‘Sun’ office. It’s a good place. I don’t know what us boys would do without it. They give you supper for six cents, and a bed for five cents more.”  “I suppose some boys don’t even have the five cents to pay,—do they?”  “They’ll trust the boys,” said Dick. “But I don’t like to get trusted. I’d be ashamed to get trusted for five cents, or ten either. One night I was comin’ down Chatham Street, with fifty cents in my pocket. I was goin’ to get a good oyster-stew, and then go to the lodgin’ house; but somehow it slipped through a hole in my trowses-pocket, and I hadn’t a cent left. If it had been summer I shouldn’t have cared, but it’s rather tough stayin’ out winter nights.”  Frank, who had always possessed a good home of his own, found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home, or money to procure the common comfort of a bed.  “What did you do?” he asked, his voice full of sympathy.  “I went to the ‘Times’ office. I knowed one of the pressmen, and he let me set down in a corner, where I was warm, and I soon got fast asleep.”  “Why don’t you get a room somewhere, and so always have a home to go to?”  “I dunno,” said Dick. “I never thought of it. P’rhaps I may hire a furnished house on Madison Square.”  “That’s where Flora McFlimsey lived.”  “I don’t know her,” said Dick, who had never read the popular poem of which she is the heroine.  While this conversation was going on, they had turned into Twenty-fifth Street, and had by this time reached Third Avenue.  Just before entering it, their attention was drawn to the rather singular conduct of an individual in front of them. Stopping suddenly, he appeared to pick up something from the sidewalk, and then looked about him in rather a confused way.  “I know his game,” whispered Dick. “Come along and you’ll see what it is.”  He hurried Frank forward until they overtook the man, who had come to a stand-still.  “Have you found anything?” asked Dick.  “Yes,” said the man, “I’ve found this.”  He exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills, to judge from its plethoric appearance.  “Whew!” exclaimed Dick; “you’re in luck.”  “I suppose somebody has lost it,” said the man, “and will offer a handsome reward.”  “Which you’ll get.”  “Unfortunately I am obliged to take the next train to Boston. That’s where I live. I haven’t time to hunt up the owner.”  “Then I suppose you’ll take the pocket-book with you,” said Dick, with assumed simplicity.  “I should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it returned to the owner,” said the man, glancing at the boys.  “I’m honest,” said Dick.  “I’ve no doubt of it,” said the other. “Well, young man, I’ll make you an offer. You take the pocket-book—”  “All right. Hand it over, then.”  “Wait a minute. There must be a large sum inside. I shouldn’t wonder if there might be a thousand dollars. The owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward.”  “Why don’t you stay and get it?” asked Frank.  “I would, only there is sickness in my family, and I must get home as soon as possible. Just give me twenty dollars, and I’ll hand you the pocket-book, and let you make whatever you can out of it. Come, that’s a good offer. What do you say?”  Dick was well dressed, so that the other did not regard it as at all improbable that he might possess that sum. He was prepared, however, to let him have it for less, if necessary.  “Twenty dollars is a good deal of money,” said Dick, appearing to hesitate.  “You’ll get it back, and a good deal more,” said the stranger, persuasively.  “I don’t know but I shall. What would you do, Frank?”  “I don’t know but I would,” said Frank, “if you’ve got the money.” He was not a little surprised to think that Dick had so much by him.  “I don’t know but I will,” said Dick, after some irresolution. “I guess I won’t lose much.”  “You can’t lose anything,” said the stranger briskly. “Only be quick, for I must be on my way to the cars. I am afraid I shall miss them now.”  Dick pulled out a bill from his pocket, and handed it to the stranger, receiving the pocket-book in return. At that moment a policeman turned the corner, and the stranger, hurriedly thrusting the bill into his pocket, without looking at it, made off with rapid steps.  “What is there in the pocket-book, Dick?” asked Frank in some excitement. “I hope there’s enough to pay you for the money you gave him.”  Dick laughed.  “I’ll risk that,” said he.  “But you gave him twenty dollars. That’s a good deal of money.”  “If I had given him as much as that, I should deserve to be cheated out of it.”  “But you did,—didn’t you?”  “He thought so.”  “What was it, then?”  “It was nothing but a dry-goods circular got up to imitate a bank-bill.”  Frank looked sober.  “You ought not to have cheated him, Dick,” he said, reproachfully.  “Didn’t he want to cheat me?”  “I don’t know.”  “What do you s’pose there is in that pocket-book?” asked Dick, holding it up.  Frank surveyed its ample proportions, and answered sincerely enough, “Money, and a good deal of it.”  “There aint stamps enough in it to buy a oyster-stew,” said Dick. “If you don’t believe it, just look while I open it.”  So saying he opened the pocket-book, and showed Frank that it was stuffed out with pieces of blank paper, carefully folded up in the shape of bills. Frank, who was unused to city life, and had never heard anything of the “drop-game” looked amazed at this unexpected development.  “I knowed how it was all the time,” said Dick. “I guess I got the best of him there. This wallet’s worth somethin’. I shall use it to keep my stiffkit’s of Erie stock in, and all my other papers what aint of no use to anybody but the owner.”  “That’s the kind of papers it’s got in it now,” said Frank, smiling.  “That’s so!” said Dick.  “By hokey!” he exclaimed suddenly, “if there aint the old chap comin’ back ag’in. He looks as if he’d heard bad news from his sick family.”  By this time the pocket-book dropper had come up.  Approaching the boys, he said in an undertone to Dick, “Give me back that pocket-book, you young rascal!”  “Beg your pardon, mister,” said Dick, “but was you addressin’ me?”  “Yes, I was.”  “’Cause you called me by the wrong name. I’ve knowed some rascals, but I aint the honor to belong to the family.”  He looked significantly at the other as he spoke, which didn’t improve the man’s temper. Accustomed to swindle others, he did not fancy being practised upon in return.  “Give me back that pocket-book,” he repeated in a threatening voice.  “Couldn’t do it,” said Dick, coolly. “I’m go’n’ to restore it to the owner. The contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick, and he’ll be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder.”  “You gave me a bogus bill,” said the man.  “It’s what I use myself,” said Dick.  “You’ve swindled me.”  “I thought it was the other way.”  “None of your nonsense,” said the man angrily. “If you don’t give up that pocket-book, I’ll call a policeman.”  “I wish you would,” said Dick. “They’ll know most likely whether it’s Stewart or Astor that’s lost the pocket-book, and I can get ’em to return it.”  The “dropper,” whose object it was to recover the pocket-book, in order to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer, was irritated by Dick’s refusal, and above all by the coolness he displayed. He resolved to make one more attempt.  “Do you want to pass the night in the Tombs?” he asked.  “Thank you for your very obligin’ proposal,” said Dick; “but it aint convenient to-day. Any other time, when you’d like to have me come and stop with you, I’m agreeable; but my two youngest children is down with the measles, and I expect I’ll have to set up all night to take care of ’em. Is the Tombs, in gineral, a pleasant place of residence?”  Dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that Frank could scarcely forbear laughing, though it is hardly necessary to say that the dropper was by no means so inclined.  “You’ll know sometime,” he said, scowling.  “I’ll make you a fair offer,” said Dick. “If I get more’n fifty dollars as a reward for my honesty, I’ll divide with you. But I say, aint it most time to go back to your sick family in Boston?”  Finding that nothing was to be made out of Dick, the man strode away with a muttered curse.  “You were too smart for him, Dick,” said Frank.  “Yes,” said Dick, “I aint knocked round the city streets all my life for nothin’.”    "]]]
