The first was Victor Russell, a lad of fourteen, whose arrow went three feet above the mark.  “The prize is mine if none of you do better than that,” laughed Victor, good-naturedly.  “I hope not, for the credit of the club,” said the president. “Mr. Crawford, will you shoot next?”  “I would prefer to be the last,” said Carl, modestly.  “John Livermore, your turn now.”  John came a little nearer than his predecessor, but did not distinguish himself.  “If that is a specimen of the skill of the clubmen,” thought Carl, “my chance is a good one.”  Next came Frank Stockton, whose arrow stuck only three inches from the center of the target.  “Good for Fred!” cried Edward Downie. “Just wait till you see me shoot!”  “Are you a dangerous rival?” asked Carl, smiling.  “I can hit a barn door if I am only near enough,” replied Edward.  “Edward Downie!” called the president.  Edward took his bow and advanced to the proper place, bent it, and the arrow sped on its way.  There was a murmur of surprise when his arrow struck only an inch to the right of the centre. No one was more amazed than Edward himself, for he was accounted far from skillful. It was indeed a lucky accident.  “What do you say to that?” asked Edward, triumphantly.  “I think the prize is yours. I had no idea you could shoot like that,”  said Carl.  “Nor I,” rejoined Edward, laughing.  “Carl Crawford!” called the president.  Carl took his position, and bent his bow with the greatest care. He exercised unusual deliberation, for success meant more to him than to any of the others. A dollar to him in his present circumstances would be a small fortune, while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly felt. His heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on its mission.  His unusual deliberation, and the fact that he was a stranger, excited strong interest, and all eyes followed the arrow with eager attentiveness.  There was a sudden shout of irrepressible excitement.  Carl’s arrow had struck the bull’s-eye and the prize was his.  “Christopher!” exclaimed Edward Downie, “you’ve beaten me, after all!”  “I’m almost sorry,” said Carl, apologetically, but the light in his eyes hardly bore out the statement.  “Never mind. Everybody would have called it a fluke if I had won,”  said Edward. “I expect to get the prize for the long jump. I am good at that.”  “So am I, but I won’t compete; I will leave it to you.”  “No, no. I want to win fair.”  Carl accordingly entered his name. He made the second best jump, but Edward’s exceeded his by a couple of inches, and the prize was adjudged to him.  “I have my revenge,” he said, smiling. “I am glad I won, for it wouldn’t have been to the credit of the club to have an outsider carry off two prizes.”  “I am perfectly satisfied,” said Carl; “I ought to be, for I did not expect to carry off any.”  Carl decided not to compete for any other prize. He had invested twenty cents and got back a dollar, which left him a profit of eighty cents. This, with his original quarter, made him the possessor of a dollar and five cents.  “My luck seems to have turned,” he said to himself, and the thought gave him fresh courage.  It was five o’clock when the games were over, and Carl prepared to start again on his journey.  “Where are you going to take supper?” asked Downie.  “I--don’t--know.”  “Come home with me. If you are in no hurry, you may as well stay overnight, and go on in the morning.”  “Are you sure it won’t inconvenience you?”  “Not at all.”  “Then I’ll accept with thanks.”    CHAPTER XII.  AN ODD ACQUAINTANCE.   After breakfast the next morning Carl started again on his way. His new friend, Edward Downie, accompanied him for a mile, having an errand at that distance.  “I wish you good luck, Carl,” he said, earnestly. “When you come this way again, be sure to stop in and see me.”  “I will certainly do so, but I hope I may find employment.”  “At any rate,” thought Carl, as he resumed his journey alone, “I am better off than I was yesterday morning. Then I had but twenty-five cents; now I have a dollar.”  This was satisfactory as far as it went, but Carl was sensible that he was making no progress in his plan of earning a living. He was simply living from hand to mouth, and but for good luck he would have had to go hungry, and perhaps have been obliged to sleep out doors. What he wanted was employment.  It was about ten o’clock when, looking along the road, his curiosity was excited by a man of very unusual figure a few rods in advance of him. He looked no taller than a boy of ten; but his frame was large, his shoulders broad, and his arms were of unusual length. He might properly be called a dwarf.  “I am glad I am not so small as that,” thought Carl. “I am richer than he in having a good figure. I should not like to excite attention wherever I go by being unusually large or unusually small.”  Some boys would have felt inclined to laugh at the queer figure, but Carl had too much good feeling. His curiosity certainly was aroused, and he thought he would like to get acquainted with the little man, whose garments of fine texture showed that, though short in stature, he was probably long in purse. He didn’t quite know how to pave the way for an acquaintance, but circumstances favored him.  The little man drew out a handkerchief from the side pocket of his overcoat. With it fluttered out a bank bill, which fell to the ground apparently unobserved by the owner.  Carl hurried on, and, picking up the bill, said to the small stranger as he touched his arm: “Here is some money you just dropped, sir.”  The little man turned round and smiled pleasantly.  “Thank you. Are you sure it is mine?”  “Yes, sir; it came out with your handkerchief.”  “Let me see. So it is mine. I was very careless to put it loose in my pocket.”  “You were rather careless, sir.”  “Of what denomination is it?’  “It is a two-dollar note.”  “If you had been a poor boy,” said the little man, eying Carl keenly, “you might have been tempted to keep it. I might not have known.”  Carl smiled.  “What makes you think I am not a poor boy?” he said.  “You are well dressed.”  “That is true; but all the money I have is a dollar and five cents.”  “You know where to get more? You have a good home?”  “I had a home, but now I am thrown on my own exertions,” said Carl, soberly.  “Dear me! That is bad! If I were better acquainted, I might ask more particularly how this happens. Are you an orphan?”  “No, sir; my father is living.”  “And your mother is dead?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Is your father a poor man?”  “No, sir; he is moderately rich.”  “Yet you have to fight your own way?”  “Yes, sir. I have a stepmother.”  “I see. Are you sure you are not unreasonably prejudiced against your stepmother? All stepmothers are not bad or unkind.”  “I know that, sir.”  “Yours is, I presume?”  “You can judge for yourself.”  Carl recited some incidents in his experience with his stepmother. The stranger listened with evident interest.  “I am not in general in favor of boys leaving home except on extreme provocation,” he said, after a pause; “but in your case, as your father seems to take part against you, I think you may be justified, especially as, at your age, you have a fair chance of making your own living.”  “I am glad you think that, sir. I have begun to wonder whether I have not acted rashly.”  “In undertaking to support yourself?”  “Yes, sir.”  “How old are you?”  “Sixteen.”  “At fourteen I was obliged to undertake what you have now before you.”  “To support yourself?”  “Yes; I was left an orphan at fourteen, with no money left me by my poor father, and no relatives who could help me.”  “How did you make out, sir?” asked Carl, feeling very much interested.  “I sold papers for a while--in Newark, New Jersey--then I got a place at three dollars a week, out of which I had to pay for board, lodging and clothes. Well, I won’t go through my history. I will only say that whatever I did I did as well as I could. I am now a man of about middle age, and I am moderately wealthy.”  “I am very much encouraged by what you tell me, sir.”  “Perhaps you don’t understand what a hard struggle I had. More than once I have had to go to bed hungry. Sometimes I have had to sleep out, but one mustn’t be afraid to rough it a little when he is young. I shouldn’t like to sleep out now, or go to bed without my supper,” and the little man laughed softly.  “Yes, sir; I expect to rough it, but if I could only get a situation, at no matter what income, I should feel encouraged.”  “You have earned no money yet?”  “Yes, sir; I earned a dollar yesterday.”  “At what kind of work?”  “Archery.”  The little man looked surprised.  “Is that a business?” he asked, curiously.  “I’ll explain how it was,” and Carl told about the contest.  “So you hit the mark?” said the little man, significantly.  Somehow, there was something in the little man’s tone that put new courage into Carl, and incited him to fresh effort.  “I wonder, sir,” he said, after a pause, “that you should be walking, when you can well afford to ride.”  The little man smiled.  “It is by advice of my physician,” he said. “He tells me I am getting too stout, and ought to take more or less exercise in the open air. So I am trying to follow his advice.”  “Are you in business near here, sir?”  “At a large town six miles distant. I may not walk all the way there, but I have a place to call at near by, and thought I would avail myself of the good chance offered to take a little exercise. I feel repaid. I have made a pleasant acquaintance.”  “Thank you, sir.”  “There is my card,” and the little man took out a business card, reading thus:  HENRY JENNINGS, FURNITURE WAREHOUSE, MILFORD.   “I manufacture my furniture in the country,” he continued, “but I ship it by special arrangements to a house in New York in which I am also interested.”  “Yes, sir, I see. Do you employ many persons in your establishment?”  “About thirty.”  “Do you think you could make room for me?”  “Do you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5301"],["title","The Imperialist (#0)"],["body","IMPERIALIST   By Sara Jeannette Duncan, 1861-1922 (aka Mrs. Everard Cotes)   1904     CHAPTER I  It would have been idle to inquire into the antecedents, or even the circumstances, of old Mother Beggarlegs. She would never tell; the children, at all events, were convinced of that; and it was only the children, perhaps, who had the time and the inclination to speculate. Her occupation was clear; she presided like a venerable stooping hawk, over a stall in the covered part of the Elgin market-place, where she sold gingerbread horses and large round gingerbread cookies, and brown sticky squares of what was known in all circles in Elgin as taffy. She came, it was understood, with the dawn; with the night she vanished, spending the interval on a not improbable broomstick. Her gingerbread was better than anybody’s; but there was no comfort in standing, first on one foot and then on the other, while you made up your mind--the horses were spirited and you could eat them a leg at a time, but there was more in the cookies--she bent such a look on you, so fierce and intolerant of vacillation. She belonged to the group of odd characters, rarer now than they used to be, etched upon the vague consciousness of small towns as in a way mysterious and uncanny; some said that Mother Beggarlegs was connected with the aristocracy and some that she had been “let off” being hanged. The alternative was allowed full swing, but in any case it was clear that such persons contributed little to the common good and, being reticent, were not entertaining. So you bought your gingerbread, concealing, as it were, your weapons, paying your copper coins with a neutral nervous eye, and made off to a safe distance, whence you turned to shout insultingly, if you were an untrounced young male of Elgin, “Old Mother Beggarlegs! Old Mother Beggarlegs!” And why “Beggarlegs” nobody in the world could tell you. It might have been a dateless waggery, or it might have been a corruption of some more dignified surname, but it was all she ever got. Serious, meticulous persons called her “Mrs” Beggarlegs, slightly lowering their voices and slurring it, however, it must be admitted. The name invested her with a graceless, anatomical interest, it penetrated her wizened black and derisively exposed her; her name went far indeed to make her dramatic. Lorne Murchison, when he was quite a little boy was affected by this and by the unfairness of the way it singled her out. Moved partly by the oppression of the feeling and partly by a desire for information he asked her sociably one day, in the act of purchase, why the gilt was generally off her gingerbread. He had been looking long, as a matter of fact, for gingerbread with the gilt on it, being accustomed to the phrase on the lips of his father in connection with small profits. Mother Beggarlegs, so unaccustomed to politeness that she could not instantly recognize it, answered him with an imprecation at which he, no doubt, retreated, suddenly thrown on the defensive hurling the usual taunt. One prefers to hope he didn’t, with the invincible optimism one has for the behaviour of lovable people; but whether or not his kind attempt at colloquy is the first indication I can find of that active sympathy with the disabilities of his fellow-beings which stamped him later so intelligent a meliorist. Even in his boy’s beginning he had a heart for the work; and Mother Beggarlegs, but for a hasty conclusion, might have made him a friend.  It is hard to invest Mother Beggarlegs with importance, but the date helps me--the date I mean, of this chapter about Elgin; she was a person to be reckoned with on the twenty-fourth of May. I will say at once, for the reminder to persons living in England that the twenty-fourth of May was the Queen’s Birthday. Nobody in Elgin can possibly have forgotten it. The Elgin children had a rhyme about it--     The twenty-fourth of May       Is the Queen’s Birthday;    If you don’t give us a holiday,       We’ll all run away.  But Elgin was in Canada. In Canada the twenty-fourth of May WAS the Queen’s Birthday; and these were times and regions far removed from the prescription that the anniversary “should be observed” on any of those various outlying dates which by now, must have produced in her immediate people such indecision as to the date upon which Her Majesty really did come into the world. That day, and that only, was the observed, the celebrated, a day with an essence in it, dawning more gloriously than other days and ending more regretfully, unless, indeed, it fell on a Sunday when it was “kept” on the Monday, with a slightly clouded feeling that it wasn’t exactly the same thing. Travelled persons, who had spent the anniversary there, were apt to come back with a poor opinion of its celebration in “the old country”--a pleasant relish to the more-than-ever appreciated advantages of the new, the advantages that came out so by contrast. More space such persons indicated, more enterprise they boasted, and even more loyalty they would flourish, all with an affectionate reminiscent smile at the little ways of a grandmother. A “Bank” holiday, indeed! Here it was a real holiday, that woke you with bells and cannon--who has forgotten the time the ancient piece of ordnance in “the Square” blew out all the windows in the Methodist church?--and went on with squibs and crackers till you didn’t know where to step on the sidewalks, and ended up splendidly with rockets and fire-balloons and drunken Indians vociferous on their way to the lock-up. Such a day for the hotels, with teams hitched three abreast in front of their aromatic barrooms; such a day for the circus, with half the farmers of Fox County agape before the posters--with all their chic and shock they cannot produce such posters nowadays, nor are there any vacant lots to form attractive backgrounds--such a day for Mother Beggarlegs! The hotels, and the shops and stalls for eating and drinking, were the only places in which business was done; the public sentiment put universal shutters up, but the public appetite insisted upon excepting the means to carnival. An air of ceremonial festivity those fastened shutters gave; the sunny little town sat round them, important and significant, and nobody was ever known to forget that they were up, and go on a fool’s errand. No doubt they had an impressiveness for the young countryfolk that strolled up and down Main Street in their honest best, turning into Snow’s for ice-cream when a youth was disposed to treat. (Gallantry exacted ten-cent dishes, but for young ladies alone, or family parties, Mrs Snow would bring five-cent quantities almost without asking, and for very small boys one dish and the requisite number of spoons.) There was discrimination, there was choice, in this matter of treating. A happy excitement accompanied it, which you could read in the way Corydon clapped his soft felt hat on his head as he pocketed the change. To be treated--to ten-cent dishes--three times in the course of the day by the same young man gave matter for private reflection and for public entertainment, expressed in the broad grins of less reckless people. I speak of a soft felt hat, but it might be more than that: it might be a dark green one, with a feather in it; and here was distinction, for such a hat indicated that its owner belonged to the Independent Order of Foresters, who Would leave their spring wheat for forty miles round to meet in Elgin and march in procession, wearing their hats, and dazzlingly scatter upon Main Street. They gave the day its touch of imagination, those green cocked hats; they were lyrical upon the highways; along the prosaic sidewalks by twos and threes they sang together. It is no great thing, a hat of any quality; but a small thing may ring dramatic on the right metal, and in the vivid idea of Lorne Murchison and his sister Advena a Robin Hood walked in every Independent Forester, especially in the procession. Which shows the risks you run if you, a person of honest livelihood and solicited vote, adopt any portion of a habit not familiar to you, and go marching about with a banner and a band. Two children may be standing at the first street corner, to whom your respectability and your property may at once become illusion and your outlawry the delightful fact.  A cheap trip brought the Order of Green Hats to Elgin; and there were cheap trips on this great day to persuade other persons to leave it. The Grand Trunk had even then an idea of encouraging social combination for change of scene, and it was quite a common thing for the operatives of the Milburn Boiler Company to arrange to get themselves carried to the lakeside or “the Falls” at half a dollar a head. The “hands” got it up themselves and it was a question in Elgin whether one might sink one’s dignity and go as a hand for the sake of the fifty-cent opportunity, a question usually decided in the negative. The social distinctions of Elgin may not be easily appreciated by people accustomed to the rough and ready standards of a world at the other end of the Grand Trunk; but it will be clear at a glance that nobody whose occupation prescribed a clean face could be expected to travel cheek by jowl, as a privilege, with persons who were habitually seen with smutty ones, barefaced smut, streaming out at the polite afternoon hour of six, jangling an empty dinner pail. So much we may decide, and leave it, reflecting as we go how simple and satisfactory, after all, are the prejudices which can hold up such obvious justification. There was recently to be pointed out in England the heir to a dukedom who loved stoking, and got his face smutty by preference. He would have been deplorably subversive of accepted conventions in Elgin; but, happily or otherwise, such persons and such places have at present little more than an imaginative acquaintance, vaguely cordial on the one side, vaguely critical on the other, and of no importance in the sum.
