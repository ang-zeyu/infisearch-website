Clean clothes and a dirty skin don’t go very well together. Frank, you may attend to him. I am obliged to go at once. Have you got as much money as you require?”  “Yes, uncle.”  “One more word, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney, addressing Dick; “I may be rash in trusting a boy of whom I know nothing, but I like your looks, and I think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew.”  “Yes, I will, sir,” said Dick, earnestly. “Honor bright!”  “Very well. A pleasant time to you.”  The process of cleansing commenced. To tell the truth Dick needed it, and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant. Frank added to his gift a shirt, stockings, and an old pair of shoes. “I am sorry I haven’t any cap,” said he.  “I’ve got one,” said Dick.  “It isn’t so new as it might be,” said Frank, surveying an old felt hat, which had once been black, but was now dingy, with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off.  “No,” said Dick; “my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy, and I’ve kep’ it ever since out of respect for his memory. But I’ll get a new one now. I can buy one cheap on Chatham Street.”  “Is that near here?”  “Only five minutes’ walk.”  “Then we can get one on the way.”  When Dick was dressed in his new attire, with his face and hands clean, and his hair brushed, it was difficult to imagine that he was the same boy.  He now looked quite handsome, and might readily have been taken for a young gentleman, except that his hands were red and grimy.  “Look at yourself,” said Frank, leading him before the mirror.  “By gracious!” said Dick, starting back in astonishment, “that isn’t me, is it?”  “Don’t you know yourself?” asked Frank, smiling.  “It reminds me of Cinderella,” said Dick, “when she was changed into a fairy princess. I see it one night at Barnum’s. What’ll Johnny Nolan say when he sees me? He won’t dare to speak to such a young swell as I be now. Aint it rich?” and Dick burst into a loud laugh. His fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friend’s surprise. Then the thought of the valuable gifts he had received occurred to him, and he looked gratefully at Frank.  “You’re a brick,” he said.  “A what?”  “A brick! You’re a jolly good fellow to give me such a present.”  “You’re quite welcome, Dick,” said Frank, kindly. “I’m better off than you are, and I can spare the clothes just as well as not. You must have a new hat though. But that we can get when we go out. The old clothes you can make into a bundle.”  “Wait a minute till I get my handkercher,” and Dick pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag, which might have been white once, though it did not look like it, and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt.  “You mustn’t carry that,” said Frank.  “But I’ve got a cold,” said Dick.  “Oh, I don’t mean you to go without a handkerchief. I’ll give you one.”  Frank opened his trunk and pulled out two, which he gave to Dick.  “I wonder if I aint dreamin’,” said Dick, once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass. “I’m afraid I’m dreamin’, and shall wake up in a barrel, as I did night afore last.”  “Shall I pinch you so you can wake here?” asked Frank, playfully.  “Yes,” said Dick, seriously, “I wish you would.”  He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket, and Frank pinched him pretty hard, so that Dick winced.  “Yes, I guess I’m awake,” said Dick; “you’ve got a pair of nippers, you have. But what shall I do with my brush and blacking?” he asked.  “You can leave them here till we come back,” said Frank. “They will be safe.”  “Hold on a minute,” said Dick, surveying Frank’s boots with a professional eye, “you aint got a good shine on them boots. I’ll make ’em shine so you can see your face in ’em.”  And he was as good as his word.  “Thank you,” said Frank; “now you had better brush your own shoes.”  This had not occurred to Dick, for in general the professional boot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots, if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair.  The two boys now went downstairs together. They met the same servant who had spoken to Dick a few minutes before, but there was no recognition.  “He don’t know me,” said Dick. “He thinks I’m a young swell like you.”  “What’s a swell?”  “Oh, a feller that wears nobby clothes like you.”  “And you, too, Dick.”  “Yes,” said Dick, “who’d ever have thought as I should have turned into a swell?”  They had now got out on Broadway, and were slowly walking along the west side by the Park, when who should Dick see in front of him, but Johnny Nolan?  Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnny’s amazement at his change in appearance. He stole up behind him, and struck him on the back.  “Hallo, Johnny, how many shines have you had?”  Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick, whose voice he recognized, but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick, but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity.  “What luck, Johnny?” repeated Dick.  Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment.  “Who be you?” he said.  “Well, that’s a good one,” laughed Dick; “so you don’t know Dick?”  “Where’d you get all them clothes?” asked Johnny. “Have you been stealin’?”  “Say that again, and I’ll lick you. No, I’ve lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin’ to a party, and didn’t have none fit to wear, and so I put on my second-best for a change.”  Without deigning any further explanation, Dick went off, followed by the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan, who could not quite make up his mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was really Ragged Dick or not.  In order to reach Chatham Street it was necessary to cross Broadway. This was easier proposed than done. There is always such a throng of omnibuses, drays, carriages, and vehicles of all kinds in the neighborhood of the Astor House, that the crossing is formidable to one who is not used to it. Dick made nothing of it, dodging in and out among the horses and wagons with perfect self-possession. Reaching the opposite sidewalk, he looked back, and found that Frank had retreated in dismay, and that the width of the street was between them.  “Come across!” called out Dick.  “I don’t see any chance,” said Frank, looking anxiously at the prospect before him. “I’m afraid of being run over.”  “If you are, you can sue ’em for damages,” said Dick.  Finally Frank got safely over after several narrow escapes, as he considered them.  “Is it always so crowded?” he asked.  “A good deal worse sometimes,” said Dick. “I knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross, and at last got run over by an omnibus, leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children. His widder, a beautiful young woman, was obliged to start a peanut and apple stand. There she is now.”  “Where?”  Dick pointed to a hideous old woman, of large proportions, wearing a bonnet of immense size, who presided over an apple-stand close by.  Frank laughed.  “If that is the case,” he said, “I think I will patronize her.”  “Leave it to me,” said Dick, winking.  He advanced gravely to the apple-stand, and said, “Old lady, have you paid your taxes?”  The astonished woman opened her eyes.  “I’m a gov’ment officer,” said Dick, “sent by the mayor to collect your taxes. I’ll take it in apples just to oblige. That big red one will about pay what you’re owin’ to the gov’ment.”  “I don’t know nothing about no taxes,” said the old woman, in bewilderment.  “Then,” said Dick, “I’ll let you off this time. Give us two of your best apples, and my friend here, the President of the Common Council, will pay you.”  Frank smiling, paid three cents apiece for the apples, and they sauntered on, Dick remarking, “If these apples aint good, old lady, we’ll return ’em, and get our money back.” This would have been rather difficult in his case, as the apple was already half consumed.  Chatham Street, where they wished to go, being on the East side, the two boys crossed the Park. This is an enclosure of about ten acres, which years ago was covered with a green sward, but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings. Dick pointed out the City Hall, the Hall of Records, and the Rotunda. The former is a white building of large size, and surmounted by a cupola.  “That’s where the mayor’s office is,” said Dick. “Him and me are very good friends. I once blacked his boots by partic’lar appointment. That’s the way I pay my city taxes.”     CHAPTER V. CHATHAM STREET AND BROADWAY   They were soon in Chatham Street, walking between rows of ready-made clothing shops, many of which had half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk. The proprietors of these establishments stood at the doors, watching attentively the passersby, extending urgent invitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter.  “Walk in, young gentlemen,” said a stout man, at the entrance of one shop.  “No, I thank you,” replied Dick, “as the fly said to the spider.”  “We’re selling off at less than cost.”  “Of course you be. That’s where you makes your money,” said Dick. “There aint nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any profit on his goods.”  The Chatham Street trader looked after our hero as if he didn’t quite comprehend him; but Dick, without waiting for a reply, passed on with his companion.  In some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on.  “I am only offered two dollars, gentlemen, for this elegant pair of doeskin pants, made of the very best of cloth. It’s a frightful sacrifice. Who’ll give an eighth? Thank you, sir. Only seventeen shillings! Why the cloth cost more by the yard!”  This speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three men, holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in the legs, and presenting a cheap Bowery look.  Frank and Dick paused before the shop door, and finally saw them knocked down to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5348"],["title","Ragged Dick, Or, Street Life in New York with the Boot-Blacks (#4)"],["body"," a verdant-looking individual at three dollars.  “Clothes seem to be pretty cheap here,” said Frank.  “Yes, but Baxter Street is the cheapest place.”  “Is it?”  “Yes. Johnny Nolan got a whole rig-out there last week, for a dollar,—coat, cap, vest, pants, and shoes. They was very good measure, too, like my best clothes that I took off to oblige you.”  “I shall know where to come for clothes next time,” said Frank, laughing. “I had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country. I suppose the Baxter Street tailors are fashionable?”  “In course they are. Me and Horace Greeley always go there for clothes. When Horace gets a new suit, I always have one made just like it; but I can’t go the white hat. It aint becomin’ to my style of beauty.”  A little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk, distributing small printed handbills. One was handed to Frank, which he read as follows,—  “GRAND CLOSING-OUT SALE!—A variety of Beautiful and Costly Articles for Sale, at a Dollar apiece. Unparalleled Inducements! Walk in, Gentlemen!”  “Whereabouts is this sale?” asked Frank.  “In here, young gentlemen,” said a black-whiskered individual, who appeared suddenly on the scene. “Walk in.”  “Shall we go in, Dick?”  “It’s a swindlin’ shop,” said Dick, in a low voice. “I’ve been there. That man’s a regular cheat. He’s seen me before, but he don’t know me coz of my clothes.”  “Step in and see the articles,” said the man, persuasively. “You needn’t buy, you know.”  “Are all the articles worth more’n a dollar?” asked Dick.  “Yes,” said the other, “and some worth a great deal more.”  “Such as what?”  “Well, there’s a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars.”  “And you sell it for a dollar. That’s very kind of you,” said Dick, innocently.  “Walk in, and you’ll understand it.”  “No, I guess not,” said Dick. “My servants is so dishonest that I wouldn’t like to trust ’em with a silver pitcher. Come along, Frank. I hope you’ll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin’ the public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they are worth.”  “How does he manage, Dick?” asked Frank, as they went on.  “All his articles are numbered, and he makes you pay a dollar, and then shakes some dice, and whatever the figgers come to, is the number of the article you draw. Most of ’em aint worth sixpence.”  A hat and cap store being close at hand, Dick and Frank went in. For seventy-five cents, which Frank insisted on paying, Dick succeeded in getting quite a neat-looking cap, which corresponded much better with his appearance than the one he had on. The last, not being considered worth keeping, Dick dropped on the sidewalk, from which, on looking back, he saw it picked up by a brother boot-black who appeared to consider it better than his own.  They retraced their steps and went up Chambers Street to Broadway. At the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street is a large white marble warehouse, which attracted Frank’s attention.  “What building is that?” he asked, with interest.  “That belongs to my friend A. T. Stewart,” said Dick. “It’s the biggest store on Broadway.* If I ever retire from boot-blackin’, and go into mercantile pursuits, I may buy him out, or build another store that’ll take the shine off this one.”  * Mr. Stewart’s Tenth Street store was not open at the time Dick spoke.   “Were you ever in the store?” asked Frank.  “No,” said Dick; “but I’m intimate with one of Stewart’s partners. He is a cash boy, and does nothing but take money all day.”  “A very agreeable employment,” said Frank, laughing.  “Yes,” said Dick, “I’d like to be in it.”  The boys crossed to the West side of Broadway, and walked slowly up the street. To Frank it was a very interesting spectacle. Accustomed to the quiet of the country, there was something fascinating in the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks, and the great variety of vehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street. Then again the shop-windows with their multifarious contents interested and amused him, and he was constantly checking Dick to look in at some well-stocked window.  “I don’t see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy of them,” he said. “We haven’t got but two stores in our village, and Broadway seems to be full of them.”  “Yes,” said Dick; “and its pretty much the same in the avenoos, ’specially the Third, Sixth, and Eighth avenoos. The Bowery, too, is a great place for shoppin’. There everybody sells cheaper’n anybody else, and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods.”  “Where’s Barnum’s Museum?” asked Frank.  “Oh, that’s down nearly opposite the Astor House,” said Dick. “Didn’t you see a great building with lots of flags?”  “Yes.”  “Well, that’s Barnum’s.* That’s where the Happy Family live, and the lions, and bears, and curiosities generally. It’s a tip-top place. Haven’t you ever been there? It’s most as good as the Old Bowery, only the plays isn’t quite so excitin’.”  * Since destroyed by fire, and rebuilt farther up Broadway, and again burned down in February.   “I’ll go if I get time,” said Frank. “There is a boy at home who came to New York a month ago, and went to Barnum’s, and has been talking about it ever since, so I suppose it must be worth seeing.”  “They’ve got a great play at the Old Bowery now,” pursued Dick. “’Tis called the ‘Demon of the Danube.’ The Demon falls in love with a young woman, and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep rock where his castle stands.”  “That’s a queer way of showing his love,” said Frank, laughing.  “She didn’t want to go with him, you know, but was in love with another chap. When he heard about his girl bein’ carried off, he felt awful, and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free. Well, at last he got into the castle by some underground passage, and he and the Demon had a fight. Oh, it was bully seein’ ’em roll round on the stage, cuttin’ and slashin’ at each other.”  “And which got the best of it?”  “At first the Demon seemed to be ahead, but at last the young Baron got him down, and struck a dagger into his heart, sayin’, ‘Die, false and perjured villain! The dogs shall feast upon thy carcass!’ and then the Demon give an awful howl and died. Then the Baron seized his body, and threw it over the precipice.”  “It seems to me the actor who plays the Demon ought to get extra pay, if he has to be treated that way.”  “That’s so,” said Dick; “but I guess he’s used to it. It seems to agree with his constitution.”  “What building is that?” asked Frank, pointing to a structure several rods back from the street, with a large yard in front. It was an unusual sight for Broadway, all the other buildings in that neighborhood being even with the street.  “That is the New York Hospital,” said Dick. “They’re a rich institution, and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms.”  “Did you ever go in there?”  “Yes,” said Dick; “there was a friend of mine, Johnny Mullen, he was a newsboy, got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin’ Broadway down near Park Place. He was carried to the Hospital, and me and some of his friends paid his board while he was there. It was only three dollars a week, which was very cheap, considerin’ all the care they took of him. I got leave to come and see him while he was here. Everything looked so nice and comfortable, that I thought a little of coaxin’ a omnibus driver to run over me, so I might go there too.”  “Did your friend have to have his leg cut off?” asked Frank, interested.  “No,” said Dick; “though there was a young student there that was very anxious to have it cut off; but it wasn’t done, and Johnny is around the streets as well as ever.”  While this conversation was going on they reached No. 365, at the corner of Franklin Street.*  * Now the office of the Merchants’ Union Express Company.   “That’s Taylor’s Saloon,” said Dick. “When I come into a fortun’ I shall take my meals there reg’lar.”  “I have heard of it very often,” said Frank. “It is said to be very elegant. Suppose we go in and take an ice-cream. It will give us a chance to see it to better advantage.”  “Thank you,” said Dick; “I think that’s the most agreeable way of seein’ the place myself.”  The boys entered, and found themselves in a spacious and elegant saloon, resplendent with gilding, and adorned on all sides by costly mirrors. They sat down to a small table with a marble top, and Frank gave the order.  “It reminds me of Aladdin’s palace,” said Frank, looking about him.  “Does it?” said Dick; “he must have had plenty of money.”  “He had an old lamp, which he had only to rub, when the Slave of the Lamp would appear, and do whatever he wanted.”  “That must have been a valooable lamp. I’d be willin’ to give all my Erie shares for it.”  There was a tall, gaunt individual at the next table, who apparently heard this last remark of Dick’s. Turning towards our hero, he said, “May I inquire, young man, whether you are largely interested in this Erie Railroad?”  “I haven’t got no property except what’s invested in Erie,” said Dick, with a comical side-glance at Frank.  “Indeed! I suppose the investment was made by your guardian.”  “No,” said Dick; “I manage my property myself.”  “And I presume your dividends have not been large?”  “Why, no,” said Dick; “you’re about right there. They haven’t.”  “As I supposed. It’s poor stock. Now, my young friend, I can recommend a much better investment, which will yield you a large annual income. I am agent of the Excelsior Copper Mining Company, which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world. It’s sure to yield fifty per cent. on the investment. Now, all you have to do is to sell out your Erie shares, and invest in our stock, and I’ll insure you a fortune in three years. How many shares did you say you had?”  “I didn’t say, that I remember,” said Dick. “Your offer is very kind and obligin’, and as soon as I get time I’ll see about it.”  “I hope you will,” said the stranger. “Permit me to give you my card. ‘Samuel Snap, No. — Wall"]]]
