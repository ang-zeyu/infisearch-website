But the limb cut off has no power of moving.          --Thus, our loss of the _organs_ of perception and motion,         not being the destruction of the power, there is no         ground to think that the destruction of other organs or         instruments would destroy _us_.      _Objection._ These observations apply equally to brutes.        _Ans._ 1. Be it so. Perhaps they are immortal:--may hereafter       improve: we know not what latent powers they may have.          1.) The human being at one period looks as little likely to         make great intellectual attainments; for a long time he has         capacities for virtue and religion, but cannot use them.          2.) Many persons go out of the world who never became able         to exercise these capacities; _e.g._ infants.        _Ans._ 2. If brutes were immortal, it does not prove them to       be _moral agents_.          1.) It may be necessary, for aught we know, that there         should be living creatures not moral agents, nor rational.          2.) All difficulties as to what would become of them, are         founded in our ignorance.    =2.= That our souls, though not material, so depend upon the   bodily structure, that we cannot survive its destruction.      _Ans._ 1. Reason, memory, &c. _do not_ depend on the body,     as perceptions by the senses do. Death may destroy those     _instruments_, and yet not destroy the _powers_ of reflection.      _Ans._ 2. Human beings exist, here, in two very different     states, each having its own laws: sensation and reflection. By     the first we feel; by the second we reason and will.        1.) Nothing which we know to be destroyed at death, is       necessary to reflecting on ideas formerly received.        2.) Though the senses act like scaffolds, or levers, to       _bring in_ ideas, yet when once in, we can reflect, &c.       without their aid.      _Ans._ 3. There are diseases which prove fatal, &c., yet do     not, in any part of their course, _impair_ the intellect; and     this indicates that they do not _destroy_ it.        1.) In the diseases alluded to, persons have their reflective       power, in full, the very moment before death.        2.) Now, why should a disease, at a certain degree, utterly       destroy powers which were not even affected by it, up to that       point?    =3.= That death at least _suspends_ our reflective powers,   or interrupts our continuing to exist in the like state of   reflection which we do now.      _Ans._ There appears so little connection between our powers of     sensation and our powers of reflection that we cannot presume     that what might _destroy the former_, could even _suspend the     latter_.        1.) We daily see reason, memory, &c. exercised without any       assistance, that we know of, from our bodies.        2.) Seeing them in lively exercise to the last, we must infer       that death is not a discontinuance of their exercise, nor of       the enjoyments and sufferings of such exercise.        3.) Our posthumous life may be but a going on, with       additions. Like the change at our birth--which produced not       a suspension of the faculties we had before, nor a _total_       change in our state of life; but a continuance of both, with       great alterations.        4.) Death may but at once put us into a _higher_ state of       life, as our birth did; our relation to bodily organs may be       the only hinderance to our entering a higher condition of the       reflective powers.        5.) Were we even sure that death would suspend our       intellectual powers, it would not furnish even the lowest       probability that it would destroy them.      _Objec._ From the analogy of plants.        _Ans._ This furnishes poets with apt illustrations of our       frailty, but affords no proper analogy. Plants are destitute       of perception and action, and this is the very matter in       question.   REMARKS.    =1.= It has been shown, that confining ourselves to what we   know, we see no probability of ever ceasing to be:--it cannot be   concluded from the reason of the thing:--nor from the analogy of   nature.    =2.= We are therefore to go upon the belief of a future existence.    =3.= Our going into _new scenes_ and conditions, is just as   natural as our coming into the world.    =4.= Our condition may naturally be a social one.    =5.= The advantages of it may naturally be bestowed, according to   some fixed law, in proportion to one’s degrees in virtue.      1.) Perhaps not so much as now _by society_; but by God’s more     immediate action.      2.) Yet this will be no less _natural_, _i.e._ stated, fixed,     or settled.      3.) Our notions of what is natural, are enlarged by greater     knowledge of God and his works.      4.) There may be some beings in the world, to whom the whole     of Christianity is as natural as the visible course of nature     seems to us.    =6.= These probabilities of a future life, though they do not   satisfy curiosity, answer all the purposes of religion, as well   as demonstration.      1.) Even a demonstration of a future state, would not     demonstrate religion, but would be reconcilable with atheism.      2.) But as religion implies a future state, any presumption     against such a state, would be a presumption against religion.      3.) The foregoing observations remove all presumptions of that     sort, and prove to a great probability, a fundamental doctrine     of religion.   CHAPTER II.  THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD BY REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.  The question of a future life is rendered momentous by our capacity for happiness and misery.  Especially if that happiness or misery depends on our present conduct.  We should feel the deepest solicitude on this subject.  And that if there were no proof of a future life and interest, other than the probabilities just discussed.   I. _In the present world our pleasures and pains are, to a great extent, in our own power._    =1.= We see them to be consequences of our actions.    =2.= And we can _foresee_ these consequences.    =3.= Our desires are not gratified, without the right kind of   exertion.    =4.= By prudence we may enjoy life; rashness, or even neglect may   make us miserable.    =5.= Why this is so is another matter.      1.) It may be impossible to be otherwise.      2.) Or it may be best on the whole.      3.) Or God’s plan may be to make only the good happy.      4.) Or the whole plan may be incomprehensible to us.      _Objec._ It may be said “this is only the course of nature.”        _Ans._ It is granted: but          1. The course of nature is but the will of God. We admit         that God is the natural governor of the world: and must not         turn round and deny it because his government is _uniform_.          2. Our natural foresight of the consequences of actions, is         his appointment.          3. The consequences themselves, are his appointment.          4. Our ability to foresee these consequences, is God’s         _instruction_ how we are to act.      _Objec._ By this reasoning we are instructed to gratify our     appetites, and such gratification is our reward for so doing.        _Ans._ Certainly not. Foreseen pleasures and pains are proper       motives to action _in general_; but we may, in particular       cases, damage ourselves by indulgence. Our eyes are made to       see with, but not to look at every thing:--for instance the       sun.  It follows, from what has been said, that   II. _We are, now, actually under God’s government, in the strictest sense._    =1.= Admitting that there is a God, it is not so much a matter of   speculation, as of experience, that he governs us.    =2.= The annexing of pleasures and pains to certain actions, and   giving notice them, is the very essence of government.    =3.= Whether by direct acts upon us, or by contriving a general   plan, does not affect the argument.      1.) If magistrates could make laws which should _execute     themselves_, their government would be far more perfect than it     is.      2.) God’s making fire burn us, is as much an instance of     government, as if he _directly inflicted_ the burn, whenever we     touched fire.    =4.= Hence the analogy of nature shows nothing to render   incredible the Bible doctrine of God’s rewarding or punishing   according to our actions.   _Additional remarks on Punishment._  As men object chiefly to future punishment, it is proper to show further that the course of administration, as to _present_ punishment, is analogous to what religion teaches as to _the future_.  Indeed they add credibility to it.  And ought to raise the most serious apprehension.   I. _Circumstances to be observed touching present punishments._    =1.= They often follow acts which produce present pleasure or   advantage.    =2.= The sufferings often far exceed the pleasure or advantage.    =3.= They often follow remotely.    =4.= After long delay they often come suddenly.    =5.= As those remote effects are not certainly foreseen, they   may not be thought of at the time; or if so, there is a hope of   escaping.    =6.= There are opportunities of advantage, which if neglected do   not recur.    =7.= Though, in some cases, men who have sinned up to a certain   point, may retrieve their affairs, yet in many cases, reformation   is of no avail.    =8.= Inconsiderateness is often as disastrous as wilful   wrong-doing.    =9.= As some punishments by civil government, are capital, so are   some natural punishments.      1.) Seem intended to remove the offender out of the way.      2.) Or as an example to others.   II. _These things are not accidental, but proceed from fixed laws._    =1.= They are matters of daily experience.    =2.= Proceed from the general laws, by which the world is   governed.   III. _They so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53346"],["title","The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature (#6)"],["body","resemble what religion teaches, as to future punishment, that both might be expressed in the same words._  _e.g._ Proverbs, ch. i.    The analogy sufficiently answers all objections against the   Scripture doctrine of future punishment, such as      1.) That our frailty or temptations annihilate the guilt of     vice.      2.) Or the objection from necessity.      3.) Or that the Almighty cannot be contradicted.      4.) Or that he cannot be offended.   REMARKS.    =1.= Such reflections are terrific, but ought to be stated and   considered.    =2.= Disregard of a hereafter cannot be justified by any thing   short of a _demonstration_ of atheism. Even skeptical doctrines   afford no justification.    =3.= There is no pretence of reason for presuming that the   licentious will not find it better for them that they had never   been born.   CHAPTER III.  MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD.  As the structure of the world shows _intelligence_, so the mode of distributing pleasure and pain, shows government. That is, God’s _natural_ government, such as a king exercises over his subjects.  But this does not, at first sight, determine what is the _moral character_ of such government.   I. _What is a moral or righteous government?_    =1.= Not mere rewarding and punishing.    =2.= But doing this according to character.    =3.= The perfection of moral government is doing this _exactly_.      _Objec._ God is simply and absolutely benevolent.        _Ans._ Benevolence, infinite in degree, would dispose him       to produce the greatest possible happiness, regardless of       behaviour. This would rob God of other attributes; and should       not be asserted unless it can be proved. And whether it can       be proved is not the point now in hand.        The question is not whether there may not be, in the       universe, beings to whom he manifests absolute benevolence,       which might not be incompatible with justice; but whether he       treats _us_ so.    =4.= It must be owned to be vastly difficult, in such a   disordered world, to estimate with exactness the overplus of   happiness on the side of virtue: and there may be exceptions to   the rule. But it is far from being doubtful that _on the whole_,   virtue is happier than vice, in this world.   II. _The beginnings of a righteous administration, are seen in nature._    =1.= It has been proved (ch. ii.) that God _governs_: and it is   reasonable to suppose that he would govern _righteously_.      1.) Any other rule of government would be harder to account for.      2.) The Bible doctrine that hereafter the good shall be happy,     and the wicked miserable, is no more than an expectation that a     method of government, now begun, shall be carried on.    =2.= The opposite consequences of prudence and rashness, show   a right constitution of nature; and our ability to foresee and   control these consequences, shows that we are under moral law.    =3.= God has so constructed society that vice, to a great degree,   is actually punished by it.      1.) Without this, society could not exist.      2.) This is God’s government, through society; and is as     _natural_, as society.      3.) Since the course of things is God’s appointment, men are     unavoidably accountable for their behaviour.      _Objec._ Society often punishes good actions, and rewards     wickedness.        _Ans._ 1. This is not _necessary_, and consequently not       natural.        2. Good actions are never punished by society as _good_, but       because considered bad.    =4.= By the course of nature, virtue is rewarded, and vice   punished, _as such_, which proves a moral government; as will   be seen if we rightly distinguish between actions and their   qualities.      1.) An action may produce present gratification though it be     wrong: in which case the gratification is in the act, not the     morality of it: in other cases the enjoyment consists wholly in     the quality of virtuousness.      2.) Vice is naturally attended with uneasiness, apprehension,     vexation, remorse, &c.        --This is a very different feeling from that produced by mere       misfortune.        --Men comfort themselves under misfortune, that it was not       their own fault.      3.) Honest and good men are befriended _as such_.      4.) Injuries are resented as implying fault; and good offices     are regarded with gratitude on account of the _intention_, even     when they fail to benefit us.        --This is seen in family government, where children are       punished for falsehood, fretfulness, &c., though no one is       hurt.        --And also in civil government, where the absence or presence       of ill intention goes far in determining the penalty of       wrong-doing.      5.) The whole course of the world, in all ages and relations,     turns much upon approbation and disapprobation.      6.) The very fact of our having a moral nature, is a proof of     our being under God’s moral government.        --We are placed in a condition which unavoidably operates on       our moral nature.        --Hence it arises that reward to virtue and reprobation of       vice, as such, is a _rule_, never inverted. If it be thought       that there are instances to the contrary, (which is not so,)       they are evidently monstrous.        --The _degree_ in which virtue and vice receive proper       returns, is not the question now, but only the thing itself,       in some degree.      7.) It is admitted that virtue sometimes suffers, and vice     prospers; but this is _disorder_, and not the order of nature.      8.) It follows, that we have in the government of the world,     a declaration from God, for virtue and against vice. So far     as a man is true to virtue, is he on the side of the divine     administration. Such a man must have a _sense of security_, and     a hope of _something better_.    =5.= This hope is confirmed by observing that virtue has   necessary tendencies beyond their present effects.      1.) These are very obvious with regard to individuals.      2.) Are as real, though not so patent, in regard to society.        --The power of a society under the direction of virtue, tends       to prevail over power not so directed, just as power under       direction of reason, tends to prevail over brute force.        --As this may not be conceded, we will notice how the case       stands, as to reason:          · Length of time, and proper opportunity, are necessary for         reason to triumph over brutes.          · Rational beings, disunited, envious, unjust, and         treacherous, may be overcome by brutes, uniting themselves         by instinct: but this would be an inverted order of things.        --A like tendency has virtue to produce superiority.          · By making the good of society, the object of every member         of it.          · By making every one industrious in his own sphere.          · By uniting all in one bond of veracity and justice.      3.) If the part of God’s government which we see, and the part     we do not see, make up one scheme, then we see a _tendency_ in     virtue to superiority.      4.) But to _produce_ that superiority there must be        --A force proportioned to the obstacles.        --Sufficient lapse of time.        --A fair field of trial; such as extent of time, adequate       occasions, and opportunities for the virtuous to unite.      5.) These things are denied to virtue in this life, so that its     tendencies, though real, are _hindered_.      6.) But it may have all requisite advantages hereafter.        --Eternity will be lasting enough.        --Good men will unite; as they cannot do now, scattered over       the earth, and ignorant of one another.        --Other orders of virtuous beings will join; for the very       nature of virtue is a bond of union.      7.) The tendency of such an order of things, so far as seen by     vicious beings in any part of the universe, would be to the     amendment of all who were capable of it, and their recovery to     virtue.      8.) All this goes to show that the hinderances to virtue are     contingent, and that its beneficial tendencies are God’s     declarations in its favor.      9.) If the preceding considerations are thought to be too     speculative, we may easily come to the same result by     reflecting on the supremacy which any earthly nation would     attain, by entire virtue for many ages.   REMARKS.  Consider now the general system of religion. The government of the world is one; it is moral; virtue shall in the end prevail over wickedness; and to see the importance and fitness of such an arrangement we have only to consider what would be the state of things, if vice had these advantages, or virtue the contrary.    _Objec._ Why may not things be now going on in other worlds, and   continue always to go on in this world, in the same mixed and   disordered state as at present?      _Ans._ We are not proving that God’s moral government is     _perfect_, or the truth of religion, but only seeing what     there is in the course of nature, to confirm it, supposing it     to be known. Were there nothing to judge by, but the present     distribution of pleasure and pain, we should have no ground     to conclude that hereafter we should be rewarded or punished     exactly according to our deserts. But even then there would     be no indication that vice is better than virtue. Still the     preceding observations _confirm_ the doctrine of future     retribution; for,        1.) They show that the Author of nature is not indifferent to       virtue and vice.        2.) That future distributive justice would differ not in       _kind_, but in degree only, from God’s present government. It       would be the _effect_, towards which we see the _tendency_.        3.) That higher rewards and punishments _may be_ hereafter.        4.) That we should _expect_ it to be so; because the       tendencies of vice and"]]]
