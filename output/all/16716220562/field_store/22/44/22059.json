After all it was not so bad to be arrested, if all jail sentences were served in such nice clean kitchens, thought the girl.  But the reflection of a girl scout meeting at Flosston, and the stinging memory of the honor badge, picked up that night and carried off by the reckless Tessie, would torture her in spite of the more important issues in the girl's experience.  Where would Tessie go? Where would she stay and what would become of her? No doubt, as the officer had remarked, such a girl would easily become the prey of the unscrupulous, and at this thought Dagmar shuddered. What dreadful things always happen to runaway girls in the movies? Again the standard asserted its power.  Next moment the opening door announced Mrs. Cosgrove was back, and Dagmar had \"cleaned her plate.\"  \"There now, you will feel better,\" and the woman quickly gathered up the tea dishes. \"Come in the other room, and tell me your story before Jim comes back; sometimes a woman can help a girl more than a man can, and, as Jim says, I am sort of a wedge between the law and the victim,\" and she laughed lightly at the idea of interfering with her husband's business.  Dagmar told her story. She did not spare herself or attempt to cover her mistakes. She had left home because she was tired of Milltown and because she thought she would be better able to help her folks by getting out of the factory. Yes, she had listened to Tessie, and Tessie was different. Her mother allowed her out late nights, and had no objections to her going to dances in the factory hall, without brother or father. When Dagmar went her brother Frank always accompanied her.  \"Well, that's encouraging,\" spoke Mrs. Cosgrove when Dagmar paused. \"When folks have that much sense you can always talk to them. Now, when Molly comes we will talk it over with her. I wouldn't mind leaving off my work to-morrow, although I did plan to clean the cellar, and I could go out and see your mother--that is, if Molly thought there would be a chance for work for you here, and perhaps we could fix it so you could stay for a while anyway. I don't believe it would do you good to go right back in that crowd again. What you need is new chums.\"  \"Oh, I couldn't give you all that trouble,\" objected Dagmar. \"I am willing to go right back in the morning.\"  \"It's right you should say so,\" continued the wise woman, \"but you see, my girl, when you go back, you get right in the same rut again, and all those mill girls would just make life miserable for you. I am not encouraging you to stay away from home, but as Molly says, she is a leader in the scout girls you know--she always says when a thing goes wrong in one place it is best to try it in another. That is if the thing must be done, and, of course, you must work. However, wait until Molly comes in. She has learned so much since she has tried to teach others that I do believe she knows more than I do.\"  \"You say she is a scout lieutenant?\"  \"Yes, they only take girls eighteen or over for that office and my Molly was eighteen two days before she was elected,\" and at the thought Mrs. Cosgrove indulged in a satisfactory chuckle.  It was all very bewildering to Dagmar, but just how it happened that she did not return to Flosston immediately was due to a very interesting plan made by Molly and co-operated in by her official father, and finally worked out by the near-official mother.     CHAPTER VI  A NOVEL JAIL   Thus it was that the girl scouts of Flosston and Lieutenant Molly Cosgrove of Franklin stumbled over the same case of a sister in need.  Returning from the big rally at the County Headquarters on that eventful evening, Molly Cosgrove found more than her usual hot cup of tea awaiting her. There was the strange young girl with the wonderful blue eyes, around which a telltale pink rim outlined the long silky lashes.  Molly thought she had never seen a prettier girl, while in turn Dagmar decided Molly Cosgrove was the very biggest, dearest, noblest girl she had ever seen. Formalities over, talk of the rally quickly put the stranger at ease.  \"We had a wonderful rally,\" Molly enthused, \"and at a business meeting held before the open session, it was decided to start obtaining recruits from the mills.\"  \"Oh, that will be splendid!\" exclaimed Dagmar, who now felt quite at home with the Cosgroves. \"We have always wanted to know about those girl scouts.\"  \"Well, you will soon have an opportunity,\" continued the girl, whose cheeks still glowed with rally excitement, \"and I am a member of the committee appointed to visit the mills.\"  \"That is just the thing,\" declared Mrs. Cosgrove, \"for your boss always lets you follow the Troop orders, and by going into Flosston you may fix it for this scared little girl to stay here for a while.\"  \"There, Mother, I always said you should be on the pay-roll. Isn't she the loveliest cop?\" Molly asked Dagmar. \"No wonder the Town Council thanked Mrs. Jim Cosgrove for her work among the women and girls! Why, Mom, you are a born welfare worker, and could easily have my position in the Mill. You see, I am what they call a welfare worker,\" again Molly addressed Dagmar directly.  \"Oh, yes, I know. We have one in the Fluffdown Mill. Her name is Miss Mathews but she hardly ever comes in our room,\" offered Dagmar.  \"Well, now Molly,\" said Mrs. Cosgrove very decidedly, \"I just mentioned we might see that the girl got work in new surroundings, with you and me to keep an eye on her, so she could cut away from that crowd. What I have been able to find out is not much to its credit and there's reasons (with a look that pointed at Dagmar's beauty) why a girl like this should not run wild. It seems to me,\" smoothing out her big apron, by way of punctuation, \"that it has all happened for the best. We can fix it so Pop won't make it an arrest after all, then you can get leave to go to Flosston first thing in the morning, can't you?\"  \"Oh, yes, the welfare work of all the big mills is co-related,\" replied the daughter, while the mother put her feet on the little velvet hassock, and seemed glad of the chance to draw her breath after the long speech.  Dagmar was sitting in one of the narrow arm chairs of the old-fashioned parlor suite. Her long, rather shapely hands traced the lines and cross-bars in her plaid skirt, and the sudden shifting of her gaze, from one speaker to the other, betrayed the nervousness she was laboring under.  \"All right then, that's one more thing settled. And do you think the girl--say, girl, I don't like that name you have, what else can we call you?\" she broke off suddenly with this question to Dagmar.  \"My name is Dagmar Bosika, and I like Bosika best,\" replied the little stranger.  \"All right, that's number three settled. You will be Bose. I can say that, but I never could think of the other queer foreign name.\"  \"And we will have to change your last name, too, I guess,\" put in Molly, \"as some one from Flosston might recognize it. We can just leave off the first syllable and have it Rose Dix or Dixon. I think Dixon would sound best.\"  \"We are settling quite a few points,\" laughed Mrs. Cosgrove, \"if some one doesn't upset them. I have no fears from Pop--\"  \"Oh, Pop is putty in our hands,\" went on the resourceful Molly, \"no danger from his end. But how about your folks, Rose?\"  Dagmar smiled before she replied. The new name struck on her ear a little oddly, but it pleased her, she had never liked Dagmar, and utterly despised the mill girls' nickname \"Daggie.\"  \"Mother and father have always said they would let me do what I thought would be best for me,\" she said at length. \"I never did anything they told me I should not, and we often talked of my getting in a store or something like that. Mother works in the mill in another room, and she was always worried about me being away from her.\"  \"A store would be no good for you,\" objected Mrs. Cosgrove, again including the girl's beauty in her scrutiny. \"You would be best off within the reach of a welfare worker like Molly. But look at the time! Martin will be in from the club, and even Dad will be comin' around for his midnight coffee, before we call this meetin' to a halt. I say, Molly, we are runnin' an opposition scout meetin' it seems to me,\" and she got up with that finality, which plainly puts the period to all conversation.  A few moments later Rose had washed face and hands, brushed her hair, as Molly kindly hinted she should, and taking her shabby, washed, but unironed, night dress from the famous \"telescope,\" she said her prayers and was ready for bed. How comfortable the room seemed! How strange she should be in it? And where was the unfortunate, headstrong Tessie?  A prayer for the safety of the wandering one sprung from the heart of this other girl, now away from home the very first night in her young life. That her mother would believe her at a girl's home, according to the little note left stuck in her looking glass, Rose was quite certain, so there was no need to worry concerning distress from the home circle, at least not yet, and tomorrow morning young Miss Cosgrove would go to the mill and very quietly arrange everything with her mother.  \"The girl scouts are better than the police,\" she decided, not quite understanding how both could work so intimately, along different lines, yet each reaching the same result to assist wayward girls.  This was, surely, a queer sort of arrest, a lovely kind of cell, and a most friendly pair of jailers, the little runaway had fallen among, and that she dreamed wonderful dreams, glowing with roses and fragrant with perfume, was not to be wondered at, for Mrs. Cosgrove's linen was sweet enough to induce even more delicious fancies.  But what of poor, lost, erring, headstrong Tessie Warlitz? Rose imagined her in all sorts of wild predicaments, but with that kindness so marked in girls who have themselves suffered cruel misunderstandings, Rose determined not to betray her chum, but rather to do her utmost to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5263"],["title","The Girl Scout Pioneers; Or, Winning the First B. C. (#7)"],["body","her, and win her back to good standing among girls--somehow. Thus really began in so subtle a manner her own interest in the principles of the Girl Scouts.  \"To help an erring sister\" is a fundamental of the cause, but Rose little knew what that silent consecration would cost her. When all was quiet, late that night, young Martin Cosgrove sauntered along home and giving the familiar \"three dots and a dash\" whistle notified his mother of his approach. The light in the sitting-room window had in its turn told Martin his mother awaited him.  \"S-s-sh!\" whispered the mother, opening the door very softly. \"Don't make any noise.\"  \"What's up or who's sick?\" asked the good-looking young man, pinching his mother's plump arm.  \"There's a little girl asleep in the spare room. Don't wake her,\" cautioned the mother, who, to prevent even a hat falling, had secured Martin's things and was putting them on the rack.  \"Friend of Molly's? Some new girl scout?\" he asked, when they reached the seclusion of the kitchen.  \"Well, no, not just that, but a poor child Dad found lost,\" she compromised.  \"Lost, eh! And Chief of Police Mrs. Cosgrove rescued the lost chee-il-dd--as usual! Mom, you're a great cop, and I hear Molly is following in your fair footsteps!\"  \"Stop your nonsense, Marty, and be off to bed. It's awful late! There's your fresh shirt for the morning. Take it along with you.\"  \"Thanks, Mom, and you have the Chink beat in his line, too,\" giving the freshly ironed cambric shirt an approving pat. \"Tell Molly to go easy out at Flosston. Those True Tred Girl Scouts are a pretty lively little bunch from what I hear.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the mother. \"What did you hear about Flosston?\"  \"Oh, just heard the boys talking. Nothing very much, but some girls ran away, not scouts, mill girls, mill detectives on their trail, and the Girl Scouts went on a hike and lassoed some poor guy by mistake. Oh, you know a lot of stuff like that, everybody hears and no one knows the real sense of. Only I thought Molly, just taking up with the Flosston work, ought to keep both eyes open, and wear good sensible shoes. Night, Mom!\" and he kissed her very fondly. Mrs. Cosgrove indulged in two special brands of real pride--her boy and her girl!     CHAPTER VII  TENDERFOOT ADVENTURES   The ends of this story are winding out like the strings of a Maypole, and just like those pretty dancing streamers, do the story lines all swing from the pole of the Girl Scout activities.  The Flosston rally was held for the purpose of planning a broader program, and as told by Lieutenant Cosgrove, the arrangements there were made to afford the mill girls a chance to enjoy the meetings, and to participate generally in the regular membership. These plans had already thrown their influence over an entire chain of the big factories of Eastern Pennsylvania.  Most of the plants employed one or two women welfare workers in their ranks, following the campaign waged by progressive women in the interests of better conditions among women wage-earners. This qualification pertained to girls as well as adults.  So it was that young Molly Cosgrove, an assistant welfare worker, would be allowed to go from one mill to another in carrying out the new movement of Girl Scouts for mill workers between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two years. No girl under sixteen was supposed to be at work in mills, and if any such was found she must have been listed at the required minimum, sixteen.  The sensational news of two girls having run away from the Fluffdown mills was now quickly making its way through Flosston and near-by communities. The Wartliz family had done its part in spreading the scandal, while the Brodix people said little, wagged their heads and grieved sincerely, for their Dagmar was a cherished daughter, and her loss had sadly strained the humble home circle.  The fact that Miss Cosgrove had arrived at Fluffdown and talked with Mrs. Brodix was known only to those workers directly at that particular bench, and they quickly surmised the welfare worker was making inquiries about Dagmar.  Instead, she had brought to the alarmed mother the news of her daughter's safety and secretly a plan had been made, whereby this little black-eyed woman would soon come out to Franklin on an evening, to see Dagmar, now known as Rose, and so make sure that the kind offices of the new found friends would be thoroughly understood, and likewise agreed to by Mrs. Brodix.  Not even the talkative Kate Jordan, who worked next to Mrs. Brodix and kept her eyes and ears attentive during Molly Cosgrove's visit to the afflicted mill hand, guessed any of this, while the escape of Tessie Wartliz, from the very grasp of Officer Cosgrove, remained a secret with those who directly encountered the business end of that experience.  Meanwhile the girls of True Tred were radiant with the prospect of their work--that of assisting the mill girls and actually taking part in real Americanization. To the younger girls, especially Cleo, Grace and Madaline, the plan opened a field of exciting adventure, for they had never been allowed to visit the mills, and were not encouraged to make acquaintance among the workers.  \"Now,\" said Cleo, when the three Tenderfoots got together after school was dismissed, \"we will have as much real fun with live girls as we have ever seen played out in the pictures. Some mill girls do the queerest things, talk so funny, you can scarcely understand them, and they act--well, just like a play. Florence Hayden says so, she helped with their Christmas Sunday School entertainment last year.\"  \"Oh, well,\" demurred Madaline more kindly, \"they never went to our schools. Some of them went to the Town Hall night school, but they only met their friends there and never got a chance to learn our ways.\"  \"You're a real good little home missionary, Madie,\" commented Grace, \"and I'll vote for you when the mill committees are made up, only,\" and she puckered her pretty mouth into a rosette intended to express deep scorn, \"of course we're too young, and we are only in the Tenderfoot Class.\"  \"I suppose Margaret will be picked,\" said Cleo, \"she is fifteen and first class and has had a merit badge.\"  \"But she lost it,\" Grace reminded the trio.  \"And is going to get another from headquarters, Captain Clark said so.\"  \"Well, she deserves it, I'm sure,\" protested Cleo.  \"Oh, of course she does, but I would, too, if my plan worked out the other day,\" went on Grace.  \"What plan?\" demanded Cleo, while Madaline pulled a long, serious face.  \"Oh, I wanted to do something noble and I tried to, but it did not just work out,\" faltered Grace, \"but--I--am going--to try it again!\" and her eyes blazed defiance at Madaline.  \"You just do, Grace Philow, and I'll--\"  \"Who cares!\" interrupted the unconquerable Grace, while Cleo looked a whole volume of inquiries.  The McKay twins were romping over from a near-by playhouse, a little tepee made of cast off \"shutters\" the janitor had put outside after wrenching them from hinges, and the girls had promptly availed themselves of the material for a most attractive playhouse.  \"Hello! hello!\" called both. \"Who wants a ride home? Mother is sending the big car.\"  \"Oh, we all do, of course,\" spoke Cleo, the first to mingle words with her delight. \"Who wouldn't love a ride in that big, spiffy limousine!\"  \"Well, thank you just the same, but I don't, just today,\" Grace surprised them with answering. \"I have an appointment with Brother Benny.\"  \"Oh!\" said Winnie McKay significantly.  \"I see!\" drawled her sister Norma.  \"Suit yourself,\" deprecated Cleo.  \"If you can't, you can't,\" philosophized Madaline.  \"That's exactly it,\" amplified Grace. \"I can't, so I can't. Thank you, Winnie and Norma, for the lovely invitation, and please let me put it down to my credit account? I would like a refund,\" and she laughed her irresistible explosive outburst, in which the whole party joined, whether willingly or from acute inflection.  A few moments later the party, all but Grace, climbed into the lovely, softly lined car, and when Winnie told the chauffeur to drive to the post-office first, Cleo was delighted to find she had a postal card to drop in the box. That would give every one around the Green a chance to see the style of the McKay twins and their school chums.  And while the big car rolled smoothly over Oakley Avenue, Grace and Bennie were hurrying about--over a woodland road too rough and too narrow for other traffic than just nimble, willing feet.  \"You're crazy!\" declared Benny, halting at the prospect of the long winding path Grace led him to, and insisted was the \"right way.\"  \"That's what the girls say,\" answered the sister, \"but really, Benny, I am not at all. Just as sane as--Libby Lintot, and you know every one says she is as crazy as a loon. But all the same if we follow this path we will come to my tree, and maybe we will find a lovely dead tramp all buried in the spring pine needles, tied up by Grace Philow Tenderfoot!\"  \"Grace Philow lunatic!\" answered the brother. \"Nice thing to make a fellow miss a whole afternoon on marbles, just to hunt a tied-up tramp!\"  \"Would you rather hunt tigers'?\" asked Grace, running along like a wild squirrel, jumping over rocks and springing across the perpetual little streams and brooklets.  \"Sure I would, wouldn't you? What's an old tramp?\" sneered Bennie.  \"Wait till you see him,\" promised Grace, \"he's lovely. That is I think he is. I didn't exactly see his face, I was so busy tieing him up,\" explained the sister.  Benny, two years younger than Grace, went forth on the man hunt, armed with his pop gun and water pistol. It was actually two days after the eventful experience of Grace and Madaline in River Bend Wood, when the latter had made such a desperate attempt to rescue the alleged \"Mrs. Johnston's wash,\" but though many hours had passed, Grace was still haunted with the awful possibilities of her beloved tramp dying there, all tied up with clove"]]]
