He remarked to me that it was time for     a new religion to spring up; that mankind were all rife and ready     for it. I thought he alluded to the Campbellite doctrine. He said     it would not be long before something would make its appearance;     he also said that he thought of leaving Pennsylvania and should     be absent for some months. I asked him how long. He said it would     depend upon circumstances. I began to think a little strange of his     remarks, as he was a minister of the gospel. I left Ohio that fall     and went to the State of New York to visit my friends who lived in     Waterloo, not far from the mine of golden Bibles. In November I was     informed that my old neighbor, E. Partridge, and the Rev. Sidney     Rigdon, were in Waterloo, and that they both had become the dupes     of Joe Smith's necromancies. It then occurred to me that Rigdon's     new religion had made its appearance, and when I became informed     of the Spaulding manuscript, I was confirmed in the opinion that     Rigdon was at least accessory, if not the principal, in getting up     this farce.\" [81]  [Footnote 81: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 317. \"Prophet of the Nineteenth Century,\" 58. \"Early Days of Mormonism,\" 172-3.]  This last article was first published in book form in 1842, thirty-four years before Rigdon's death, but never publicly denied or explained by him. Whether this particular letter was published in the _Christian Observer_ and _Episcopal Recorder_ I cannot say, but other portions of the same book evidently were, and received comment in a Mormon church organ. [82] This but emphasizes Rigdon's silence upon Dr. Rosa's letter.  [Footnote 82: _Gospel Reflector_, 19.]  In Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" [83] it is said that Rigdon, during the incubation period of Mormonism between 1827 and 1830, preached new matters of doctrine which were afterwards found to be inculcated in the Mormon Bible. The evident purpose of all this was to prepare his congregation for the acceptance of Mormonism, and the end was most successfully achieved. Evidently this and the other circumstances showing Rigdon's foreknowledge of the forthcoming Book of Mormon, all combined with a guilty conscience, irresistibly impelled the making of an explanation tending to allay the suspicion that there was a conscious purpose in all such conduct. This defense is found in a revelation to Sidney Rigdon, dated December 7, 1830, at the alleged first meeting between Rigdon and Smith, and within one month after the former's conversion. The revelation, in part, says:  [Footnote 83: Page 289. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]      \"Behold thou was sent forth, even as John, _To prepare the way_     before me, and before Elijah which should come, _and thou knewest     it not_.\" [84]  [Footnote 84: Section 35, \"Doctrine and Covenants.\" Supplement 14, _Millennial Star,_ 50. The exact date of this revelation is December 7th. 1830, according to Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 107.]  That Rigdon did prepare the way we knew before the revelation informed us of it. That it was done unconsciously we cannot even now believe.  Especially in the light of the foregoing evidence, this revelation must be construed as much more convincing proof of Rigdon's advance knowledge of the forthcoming Book of Mormon and its contents than even a tacit admission.  It is practically an admission of guilty knowledge, coupled with a transparent effort at warding off the inference of complicity in fraud by veiling the acts constituting the evidence in an assumed mysticism, which really deceives few aside from the mystic degenerate and the willing victim who enters the fold for opportunities to \"fleece the flock of Christ.\"  III.  FROM RIGDON TO SMITH _via_ P. P. PRATT.  When to this evidence already adduced is added, as will be done, conclusive proof of the identity of the salient features of the Book of Mormon and Spaulding's rewritten \"Manuscript Found,\" it would seem that the case of plagiarism through Rigdon's complicity is established beyond reasonable doubt. The Mormon objector, however, insists that no possible connection between Rigdon and Smith has ever been shown to exist prior to 1830, and that, therefore, even if Rigdon did steal the manuscript, Smith could not have obtained it for use as a help in preparing the Book of Mormon. It would seem as if the facts above recited should, even if unaided by more direct evidence, raise an almost conclusive presumption of the existence of an undiscovered connection between the two. But we are not confined to an inference from such evidence alone. There are still more pointed evidentiary circumstances to which we will now give attention.  Parley Parker Pratt was born at Burlington, Otsego County, N.Y., April 12, 1807, of parents who later resided at Canaan, Columbia County, N.Y. [85] During his sixth year (1813) he went to reside with his father's sister, named Van Cott, [86] which name afterward became conspicuous in the early history of Utah. In 1826 Pratt spent a few months with an uncle in Wayne (formerly Ontario) County, N. Y. [87]  [Footnote 85: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 17.]  [Footnote 86: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 19.]  [Footnote 87: \"Supplement 14, _Millennial Star_,\" 1.]  This, it will be remembered, is the same county in which Smith was at that time gaining much newspaper notoriety as a \"peep-stone\" money digger [88] through mention made of him in papers published in several counties in southern New York and northern Pennsylvania. [89] While Smith was thus working the gullible of his neighborhood with his necromancy, Pratt was a peddler, who, it is said, knew almost everybody in western New York. [90] At that time Ontario County took in all the territory of several counties as now bounded, and in 1820 had only a population of 80,267. [91] Pratt, therefore, could hardly have helped knowing Smith's fame, which was such as at once to have suggested him as the star actor in any scheme of fraud requiring a prophet. In view of Pratt's subsequent connection with the Wells family, [92] who were Smith's neighbors and friends, [93] it is more than probable that he knew the Smiths personally in or prior to 1826, although, of course, they would carefully guard the fact of such acquaintance from publicity as a most important secret.  [Footnote 88: \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" 27.]  [Footnote 89: \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 47.]  [Footnote 90: \"Hand Book of Mormonism,\" 3.]  [Footnote 91: Compendium, 11th Census.]  [Footnote 92: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 37.]  [Footnote 93: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" by Lucy Smith, 101-2-3.]  In October of this year Pratt went to Ohio, locating at Amherst, thirty miles west of Cleveland [94] and was also located fifty miles west of Kirtland. [95] One of the temptations inducing Pratt's departure from New York was to get to a country where, as he himself expresses it, there is \"no law to sweep [away] all the hard earnings of years to pay a small debt.\" [96] The ethical status of an average country peddler who is willing to leave his native state to avoid the payment of his \"small debts\" furnishes a fertile immorality in which to plant the seeds of religious imposture.  [Footnote 94: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 27.]  [Footnote 95: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 50.]  [Footnote 96: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 26.]  It will be remembered that it was also in 1826 that Rigdon went for a second time to reside in Ohio, where he became an itinerant \"Disciple\" preacher, laboring in the vicinity of Bainbridge, Mantua, Kirtland, Mentor, Chester, New Lisbon, and Warren, [97] at some of which places Rigdon had an unsavory reputation. [98] Rigdon and Pratt, therefore, were in the same neighborhood in 1826, and undoubtedly met soon after. The date of their first meeting is nowhere given, but may reasonably be inferred from an address delivered by Parley P. Pratt in 1843 or '4. In this discourse Pratt tells of an occurrence which transpired on his way to his future Ohio home, which occurrence furnishes the key to his first connection with Mormonism. On his way he stopped at a humble cottage, the name of whose occupant he carefully fails to give. Here, while asleep (so he says), \"a messenger of a mild and intelligent countenance suddenly stood before me [Pratt], arrayed in robes of dazzling splendor.\" According to Mormon theology, an angel is but an exalted man. [99] Of course Sidney Rigdon was an exalted man; why not, then, an angel? This angel claimed to hold the keys to the mysteries of this wonderful country, and took Pratt out to exhibit those mysteries to him. Pratt then had portrayed to his mind the whole future of Mormonism; its cities, with inhabitants from all parts of the globe; its temples, with a yet unattained splendor; its present church organization was, with considerable definiteness outlined; its political ambition to establish a temporal kingdom of God on the ruins of this government was set forth with quite as much definiteness as in the subsequent more publicly uttered, treasonable sermons. [100] I conclude from the exact manner in which this \"Angel of the Prairies\" foreknew the ambitions, hopes, and future achievements of the Mormon Church and the similar admitted foreknowledge of Rigdon and the subsequently established connection between Rigdon, Pratt, and Smith, that the \"Angel of the Prairies\" who outlined to Pratt his then contemplated and now executed religious fraud, was none other than Sidney Rigdon himself, and that this fact accounts for Pratt's failure to give the name of his host or the date of his first meeting with Rigdon.

BY ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH  The greatest of all the gifts of God unto his children, is the gift of salvation.[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov. 6:13.]  The greatest of all his works, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, which constitutes his glory.[B]  [Footnote B: Book of Moses 1:39.]  For this grand and glorious purpose, worlds are created by him and peopled with his children. He gives to them his commandments, granting the power to choose for themselves whether or not they will obey. Those who obey him in all things he has promised great blessings, they shall be added upon in his celestial kingdom for ever and ever, and shall be crowned with the fullness of his glory. But to those who reject laws, and become a law unto themselves in unrighteousness, shall punishment be meted out according to their evil deeds.  The plan of salvation, or code of laws, which is known as the gospel of Jesus Christ, was adopted in the heavens, before the foundation of the world was laid. It was appointed there that Adam our father should come to this earth and stand at the head of the whole human family. It was a part of this great plan, that he should partake of the forbidden fruit and fall, thus bringing suffering and death into the world, even for the ultimate good of his children. By many he has been severely criticized because of his fall, but Latter-day Saints, through modern revelation, have learned that such was necessary in order that man should have his agency and, through the various vicissitudes he has to pass, receive a knowledge of both good and evil, without which it would be impossible for him to gain the exaltation prepared for him.  It was also necessary because of Adam's transgression for the Only Begotten Son of the Father to come to redeem the world from Adam's fall. This also was a part of the plan chosen before the earth was made, for Jesus is called the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world. He came and redeemed us from the fall--even all the inhabitants of the earth. Not only did he redeem us from Adam's transgression, but he also redeemed us from our own sins, on condition that we obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel.[D]  [Footnote D: Heb. 5:9; Matt. 7:21; John 1:3-6.]  \"And now, behold,\" said the Prophet Lehi to his son Jacob, \"if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were, after they were created; and they must have remained for ever, and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore, they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.  \"And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free for ever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves, and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.  \"Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\"[C]  [Footnote C: II Nephi 2:22-27.]  The primary and fundamental principles of this plan of salvation are:  First: Faith in God the Father, in his Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost. We must accept them as the presiding authority in the heavens, who govern and control all things, who are omnipotent, just and true.  Second: We must accept the infinite atonement of Christ, believing that he is the Redeemer of the world, both from Adam's transgression and from our individual sins on condition of our repentance.  Third: We must repent of all our sins, giving our hearts to God, with the full intent of serving him.  Fourth: We must be baptized in water for the remission of our sins, by one who is called of God and clothed with divine authority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel.  Fifth: We must have the hands of those holding authority placed upon our heads, and through their ministrations receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,--the spirit of Truth and Prophecy that guides us in all truth.  Sixth: We must be willing to serve the Lord with all our heart, mind and strength, keeping his commandments even unto the end.  Upon these laws, salvation is based, and the promised blessings are unto all men. These conditions are not severe, nor grievous, and are within the power of the weakest of the weak, if they will only place their trust in their Redeemer.  All who repent and obey these laws, will be redeemed and saved from the sins of the world; but they who refuse and repent not, will have to suffer for their own sins. The Lord says: \"He created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness created he them, and gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship. But by the transgression of these holy laws, man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man. Wherefore the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son, as it is written in those scriptures which have been given of him. He suffered temptations, but gave no heed unto them; he was crucified, died and rose again the third day; and ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father, that as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved: not only those who believed after he came in the meridian of time, in the flesh, but all those from the beginning, even as many as were before he came, who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as [Transcriber's note: sentence leaves off here in the original.]  Moreover, he further says: \"And surely every man must repent or suffer, for I God am endless: * * * Therefore I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not! For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent, but if they would not repent, they must suffer even as I, which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both in body and spirit: and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink--nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\"[G]  [Footnote G: Doc. & Cov. 19:4, 15-19.]  These principles were taught to Adam after he was driven from the Garden of Eden, who repented and was baptized in water for the remission of his sins, and received the Holy Ghost. And Eve, when she heard the gospel plan, rejoiced, saying: \"Were it not for our transgression, we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known to their sons and daughters.\"[H]  [Footnote H: Book of Moses 5:11-12.]  Thus the principles of the gospel were taught from the beginning among the children of Adam. Some believed and accepted them, many others rejected them, bringing down upon their heads the wrath of God, for his anger was kindled against them because of their rebellion. In course of time, when the inhabitants of the earth were sufficiently corrupt, he caused the floods to come upon them, sweeping them off the earth. Noah, who was a preacher of righteousness, continued to preach these saving principles. The gospel was also taught to Abraham, and has always been among men when they were prepared to receive it.  Latter-day Saints have been severely criticised by many professing Christians for believing it necessary to comply with these first principles of the gospel. We are told that such views make us narrow and illiberal, for we reject and damn all who do not accept \"Mormonism\" and the ministration of our elders, while they on the other hand, give a broader interpretation of the scriptures, holding it but necessary to believe in Christ--to confess him with the mouth and to believe in the heart that Christ was raised from the dead.
