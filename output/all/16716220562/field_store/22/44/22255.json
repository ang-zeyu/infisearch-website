Vol. 2 (of 3) (#1)"],["body","simply got an acknowledgement from him, but did not go through some other form, satisfying the judgment, I think they term it.\"  \"Well, I am sure no one would ever doubt your word,\" cried Kate, \"even if these papers cannot be found.\"  \"I am afraid, my dear child, the great mass of legal and money-lending people do not come within the category of christians, who 'believe all things.' I must write to Moore this very day, I'll be in time for the Irish post, give me my desk, Kate.\"  \"But suppose this man insists on the production of these papers, and you cannot satisfy him?\" asked Kate, as she was leaving the room after arranging the Colonel's writing materials.  He looked up with a sudden expression of pain in his noble, benevolent countenance.  \"We shall be beggars, my child! that's all.\"  Miss Vernon walked into the drawing-room, and opened the piano mechanically; while her thoughts were busily engaged in conjecturing whether the lingering debility of indisposition, rather than justly grounded fears, prompted her grandfather's gloomy view of Lady Desmond's intelligence.  \"Shall we then really know the poverty, nurse talks of? Shall I be strong enough to say, in sincerity, '_Thy will be done!_'\"  But soon these gloomy speculations gave place to the pleasanter topic of her cousin's invitation, which seemed to have escaped her grandfather's notice.  She had been _thus_ meditating for some time, when nurse entered with a letter in her hand.  \"The master's love, Miss Kate, and if it's not too early he'd like you to go out wid him, he says he does not feel so well!\"  \"Yes, nurse, I will go and get my bonnet and shawl, when I have settled this music.\"  \"Faith now, alannah, I'm not plaised at all with the looks iv him!\"  \"How?\" said Kate, suspending her occupation of replacing the books in the music-stand, and looking up anxiously in Mrs. O'Toole's face, which wore an unusual look of care, especially about the depressed corners of her expressive mouth.  \"Sorra one iv me can tell why, but he looks like as when a big black cloud is beginin' to be dhrawn over the sun in a fine summer's day; he just sits in the chair tired like; an ses he, 'only one letther for the post, nurse,' ses he, 'but be sure it's in time for the Irish maal,' and then he give me the message, I gave yes. The Cross iv Christ betune us an harum, ses I, as soon as I see 'J. Moore, Esquire,' on the letther; how are we to have luck or grace when we have any thing to say to the man that sould Dungar, an give it up to the spalpeen that has it now; look Miss Kate, thim's the Esquires that's going now! Faith an I remember Paddy Moore, his father, carrying sacks iv corn to the mill, an meself own maid up at the big house! Ay, then, J. Moore, Esquire, ye'r the first esquire in yer family, any ways, an there was ever an always sorra to sup when there was letthers goin back an forward betune you an the masther!\"  \"But, nurse, I have always heard that Mr. Moore was an upright honourable man, and I hope grandpapa's letter will be only productive of good.\"  \"Well, well, may be so, but I'd a mighty quare dhrame both last night an the night afore. Oh, ye may laugh now, Miss Kate, but no matther! I seen the masther as plain as I see yer own sweet face forenent me, slippin, slippin down a steep slim place wid the say roarin mad ondher, an you houlding him for the dear life, an yer round white arms all strained an tremblin wid the weight that was too much for yez, an I couldn't help yez, tho' I struve an struve to run to yez; an in the struggle I woke up, all in a shake; an God forgive the word, but it's a mighty bad dhrame intirely!\"  \"No, Nurse--you say dreams go by contraries, so it is grandpapa that will be ascending some lofty eminence and dragging me after him.\"  \"It was in the mornin', asthore, in the mornin' I dhreamt it.\"  \"Never mind, nurse, if so, God will lend these slight arms strength for all that may be required of them--do not tell me any more dreams now, I must go to grandpapa.\"  \"Sweet Mary, shield ye darlint!\" ejaculated Mrs. O'Toole, as she looked after her nursling, \"but we've rested so long widout them thieving attorneys, I don't like to see them beginin' their letthers agin. _J. Moore, esquire!_ the divil go wid such esquires! amen.\"  Fearful and wonderful indeed is our spiritual organisation. Reason may smile at fears, unsubstantiated by any tangible motive, but the instant her accents of reproof have ceased, lo! the same formless and gnawing terror steals back, undiminished by one iota of its influence, to depress the soul, until again routed by reason's disciplined troops; a true guerilla warfare in which the irregular forces, ever ready to disperse and reassemble, always repulsed, but never conquered, are sure to wear out resistance in the end.  So Kate Vernon, in spite of her clear and cultivated intellect, her sound judgment, and her sense of the ridiculous, could not keep nurse's evil omen from dwelling on her mind; more, ay, a thousand times more, than her grandfather's apparent anxiety about the intelligence communicated by Lady Desmond, and they accomplished the circuit of the walls, silently, or, exchanging occasional remarks very foreign from the subject occupying both their minds.  At length the Colonel said abruptly--  \"Kate, my child, what do you think of Lady Desmond's invitation?\"  \"Oh! I think it a delightful plan; but you, grandpapa, do you think we shall be able to accept it?\"  \"At present decidedly not. I must not be farther from Dublin than I am--I fear I shall have much letter writing, if indeed I am not obliged to go to Ireland myself; if matters come right again, I shall certainly endeavour to let the Priory, and take you to Italy; this complete retirement is not good or safe.\"  \"Safe!\" said Kate, laughing. \"Why I thought it was quite _selon les regles_, of all romances, that a dethroned prince, and his lovely and interesting daughter, like you and I, should be safe only while in obscurity.\"  \"According to old romances, I grant; but according to reality, there is more danger in the strong contrasts which the occasional breaks in a life of retirement present, in the tone of mind it engenders, than in the action of society, at least to you, Kate.\"  \"Danger! Oh, tempt me not to boast,\" cried Kate, endeavouring to draw her grandfather from his moralising mood. \"You may despise old romances, but you are nevertheless assuming the tone of some melancholy Count Alphonso, warning a sensitive and angelic Lady Malvina, against the world in general: dearest and best,\" she continued, in graver and tenderer tones, \"I must swim down the troubled current of life, as you have done before me, and meet its difficulties and trials--leave me then to the same guide by whose aid, you have passed many a dangerous rapid safely, to float in a smooth, though diminutive haven at last.\"  \"You are right, Kate, quite right; but how much longer the smoothness will last, God only knows.\"  \"Well, there _is_ a God, to know all, and direct all, and that consciousness, must rob the future of all apprehension. Shall I write to Lady Desmond, on our return, and tell her of our indecision and its causes?\"  \"By all means. Yet, dear child, I wish _you_ would accept her invitation, you want change, and I could remain quite comfortably with nurse and--\"  \"Do not utter such treason! Leave you! and to amuse myself in Italy, when there is a chance that so far from being able to do without me, you may peculiarly want me.\"  \"My dear, dear, unselfish child.\"  \"Not a bit unselfish--_tout au contraire_. I should be miserable away, besides--but here are our friends, Winter and Gilpin, so, dearest grandpapa, leave the future to take care of itself; all will be arranged for the best.\"  There was no time to say more, as the painter and organist approached; but though the Colonel made no reply, some unexplained current of feeling induced him to pass his arm through Kate's, instead of offering it, as was his habit, for her support.  \"Ha! Miss Vernon, I see you have taken advantage of a stray gleam of sun, to seduce the Colonel into risking another cold--the wind is truly detestable, but as I could not keep Gilpin in doors, I came out with him, he has not a grain of prudence!\"  \"My dear Winter, it is a remarkable fine day for March, I am glad, Gilpin, you felt equal to a walk.\"  \"I think you look better,\" observed Kate.  \"Yes: I think I am better, I feel to revive at the approach, however boisterous, of spring.\"  \"_Cospetto!_ three months in Italy would make you a new man; but here, the great mystery to me is, how any one who catches a cold ever loses it.\"  \"The remedy is worse than the disease; imagine a depressed invalid in a strange country, without a single friend, or, even acquaintance, and ignorant of its language,\" returned Gilpin.  \"Wretched indeed! but wait for me, Mr. Gilpin, we have some thoughts of taking a flight to Italy, this summer,\" said Miss Vernon.  \"_Corpo di Baccho!_ I'll not be left behind: to act as Miss Vernon's _cicerone_, would be something more than commonly delightful--what a state of enjoyment you would be in; but what put such a move into your head, Colonel?\"  \"An invitation from Lady Desmond, who is at Florence,\" said Colonel Vernon, \"Our acceptance of it however is very uncertain, though I see Kate is full of the project. I had another letter, Messieurs, which I think will give you pleasure--here; read it, Winter.\"  \"Bombay--Fred Egerton--_che gusto_.\"  A quick glance at Kate. The whole party moved slowly towards Abbey Gardens, the Colonel and Winter, who read the letter aloud, and Gilpin close behind with Kate.  \"_Ad ogni uccello suo nido Ã© bello_,\" said Winter, as he concluded the epistle, \"here am I shivering and pining for a warm sun, which many years' custom has made natural to me, and there is that young scape-grace, revelling in baths; and slaves, and sunshine, dying to be back among east winds and consumption!\"  \"Captain Egerton does not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#2)"],["body","his friends--as soldiers are said to do,\" said Gilpin.  \"Pooh, pshaw!\" cried Winter, \"he was bored by a bad sea voyage; sea-sickness is at the bottom of half the sentimental adieus to my native shores, that you read in albums and annuals, wait until he gets among his tiger-shooting brother officers, or the Bombay belles, he'll soon forget the sum-total of all he left behind--stuff!\"  \"I do not quite agree with you, Mr. Winter,\" replied Kate. \"I think Captain Egerton will always remember our little circle, kindly, and be delighted to see any member of it again. Beyond this we have no right to expect; he would not charge his memory with regrets for people, who do not let his absence interfere with their pleasures or occupations.\"  \"Bravo, Miss Vernon! if he was some worthy curate, in a white tie and spectacles, you would not bustle up so warmly in his defence; but a handsome light dragoon, with moustache, and a long sword and spurs, and saucy 'make way for me look,' is another affair.\"  \"Wrong again, Mr. Winter,\" said Kate. \"I see no reason why a Lancer's cap may not cover as good qualities, as a clerical broad-brim--and I have been too long your pupil, not to appreciate form and color.\"  \"Good; and if every Lancer was like Captain Egerton, I, for one, would prefer trusting them, even in a confessional, to the white neck-clothed curates,\" chimed in the organist.  \"In truth, though Egerton is the type of a class I have always disliked, I cannot help liking him--especially when I think of his--pooh, pooh--I was forgetting--\" And Winter stopped abruptly.  \"You are mysterious,\" said the Colonel. \"But let me see the _Times_, at your house; I want to read the Indian news, that came by the last mail; and to see Mrs. Winter.\"  \"Do you really think you will go to Italy, Miss Vernon?\" asked Gilpin.  \"I fear it is problematical. I long to travel; but grandpapa has some business, and nurse has had a dream, which bodes evil for my wishes.\"  \"Oh, the dream ought not to be classed with the business.\"  \"I dare confess to you, and to you only,\" returned Kate, with a smile, \"that it seems to shake my hopes far more than the business.\"  \"The philosophic Miss Vernon--superstitious!\"  \"No, no! yet, you know--      'It may be a sound,     A tone of music, summer's eve, or spring;     A flower, the wind, the ocean, which shall wound,     Striking the electric chain wherewith we're darkly bound.'\"  \"Winter would say it was the east wind.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said Miss Vernon, \"for alas! how ignominiously physical are the causes of many a tenderly poetic mood! not that I am at all addicted to such, but--\"  \"I think it is a mistake to consider everything physical, as despicable,\" observed Gilpin; \"we hear of mere physical force, mere physical wants; but the same hand made and blended our two natures, and we shall be happy and healthy, in proportion as we train both to work in harmony, without giving undue preference to either.\"  \"I often think we have a species of trinity within us,\" said Miss Vernon. \"We have sense with all its powerful tendencies in one direction, and spirit with its aspirations in another, while the heart and its affections seem to be neutral ground, where the claims of both may be adjusted.\"  \"I like the fancy; but sense gets the upper hand in many a heart.\"  \"No,\" interrupted Kate, \"the heart may be destroyed in the struggle, but while it exists, the spirit always has fair play.\"  \"Your sentence is too sweeping; in all such warfare, the variations are so delicately shaded that--\"  \"Walk in, Colonel,\" broke in Winter; \"never mind if Mrs. Winter is in or not; Gilpin, we'll have some Scotch broth for luncheon, that will set you up. I give you no choice--in you must come.\"  \"Sense must carry the day, Mr. Gilpin,\" said Kate, smiling.         *       *       *       *       *  Some days elapsed after this conversation before a reply from Mr. Moore reached the Colonel; and the anxiety he and Kate had experienced, died away into a half-forgetfulness.  It is strange how events, which at first strike us with such keen force, lose their sharpness of outline as the mind becomes accustomed to what was at first a novel aspect of affairs; and, as nothing fresh arises, we gradually sink back into our former frame of mind, or recur to that which distressed it, in momentary spasms of anxiety.  So Kate and her grandfather had quite recovered their usual serenity, and the former had written to Lady Desmond, long and affectionately; rejoicing that the cloud which had for a while interposed between them, had been dispersed; merely mentioning the obstacle to their journey, as a temporary annoyance, and speaking of its removal as a matter of certainty.  But she did not allude to it when in conversation with the Colonel, as she fancied he avoided the subject.  Such was their frame of mind when, at the usual post hour, one morning, Mrs. O'Toole entered.  \"A letther for the masther,\" a large, blue, pitiless looking envelop, such as emanate from attorneys' and merchants' offices, implacable places, sacrificial alters, where youth and joy, tenderness and the pleasant amenities of life are immolated at the shrine of the English juggernaut \"business.\"  The Colonel, keeping his eye fixed on it, felt in his pockets for his spectacles, silently, with a certain determination of manner, very different from the joyous confusion with which he sought for them, when opening Fred Egerton's letter; then with a loud hem, as if he wished to clear both throat and brains, he tore open the missive.  Kate sat opposite gazing at him, as if she could read the contents through his countenance; and although that morning she had risen with the full conviction that the anticipated letter would only prove their anxiety to be groundless, she now felt the terrible, creeping, gnawing, sickening sensation of doubt and dread which makes the hand so cold, and the eye so dim, when felt in its full force.  This however was her first and but slight experience of care, so she sat quite still, not knowing of what she thought, until her grandfather had turned over the second page of the rather lengthy epistle; and she could see the flourishing signature at the end of it. Still the Colonel did not speak, but turned back to re-read some passage, and Kate was surprised to find she had not courage to ask \"what news?\"  At last her grandfather without looking up, handed her the letter, observing--  \"Much what I ought to have anticipated; read it, my dear.\"  Kate, with a sensation of extreme repugnance, took the letter and read as follows:--                                             \"_Dublin, March 27th_, 18--.        \"MY DEAR SIR,   \"In reply to yours of the 21st inst., on the subject of Lady Desmond's  communication to Miss Vernon, it is true that the present Mr. Taaffe  has raised the question as to whether the debt to his uncle was paid;  seeing, on searching the records, that the judgments securing it  remain unsatisfied on the roll. But, as I concluded you got warrants  to satisfy them, at the time of the payment, I was not uneasy on the  subject, and thought it unnecessary to trouble you until I should  first search amongst your papers in my possession for them, which, as  yet, I have not done, as the matter was not pressing. If, however, you  did not get the necessary warrants to satisfy, as I begin to apprehend  was the case from the tenor of your letter, I fear we shall have some  trouble, as the present Mr. Taaffe affects to consider himself bound  to conclude the debt was not paid; and obliged, in his character  as executor of his late uncle, to call it in, altho' he knows, in  his heart, (as I firmly believe), the contrary. I trust, however,  although you may not, (from your unacquaintance with law terms and  forms) recollect what sort of acknowledgment you got at the time, it  will turn up to be a warrant to satisfy, or, if not, some docu-ment  sufficient to induce a court of equity to stay any proceedings Mr.  Taaffe may be advised to institute at law, on foot of the judgment.   \"You had better search diligently among your papers and send me  whatever you find, at all affecting this matter, and in the mean time  I will search also amongst those of yours in my possession.   \"With respectful compliments to Miss Vernon, I remain, my dear sir,  your faithful and obedient servant,                                                               \"J. MOORE.    \"To Colonel Vernon, &c.\"   Kate's first feeling was that of indignant scorn at such, to her  imagination, unheard of villany as that recorded in the letter she had  just perused; but she suppressed the expression of it, in order to  put the least gloomy view of the matter, her simple sense presented,  before her grandfather.   \"After all it is not so bad,\" she said, \"you see, Mr. Moore, only  anticipates, 'some trouble,' and surely there can be no doubt your  word would be taken, especially in Ireland, before any other man's  oath!\"   \"My dear Kate, '_some trouble_,' has a very vague meaning from a  solicitor; it may be a month's quibbling or forty years' litigation;  and in law there is no such thing as honour; every thing must be  proved; and though judge and jury may believe me incapable of wronging  Mr. Taaffe of one sou; yet, if I cannot bring _legal proof_, he must  succeed.\"   \"What a dishonest wretch he must be! but I always had a horror of the  name of Taaffe!\" cried Kate, the proud, indignant blood mounting to  her forehead.   \"Some association of ideas with Taffy's thieving propensities?\"  observed the Colonel, with an effort to be cheerful.   \"But, dear grandpapa, what is to be done? this letter leaves us just  in the same state of uncertainty we were in before.\"   \"We must search amongst all my papers, dear child, as Moore advises;  if I find any thing bearing on the subject, I will send it to him; but  I much fear I shall find nothing; I destroyed a great many papers,  as useless, on leaving Dungar, and"]]]
