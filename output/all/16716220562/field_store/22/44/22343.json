The damask table cloths with the ribbon pattern must be bleached to-morrow.  Nobody else in Avonlea has such tablecloths.  And we'll put the little dining-room table on the hall landing, upstairs, for the presents.\"  Rachel was not thinking about the presents, or the housewifely details of the wedding.  Her breath was coming quicker, and the faint blush on her smooth cheeks had deepened to crimson.  She knew that a critical moment was approaching.  With a steady hand she wrote the last name on her list and drew a line under it.  \"Well, have you finished?\" asked her mother impatiently.  \"Hand it here and let me look over it to make sure that you haven't left anybody out that should be in.\"  Rachel passed the paper across the table in silence.  The room seemed to her to have grown very still.  She could hear the flies buzzing on the panes, the soft purr of the wind about the low eaves and through the apple boughs, the jerky beating of her own heart.  She felt frightened and nervous, but resolute.  Mrs. Spencer glanced down the list, murmuring the names aloud and nodding approval at each. But when she came to the last name, she did not utter it.  She cast a black glance at Rachel, and a spark leaped up in the depths of the pale eyes.  On her face were anger, amazement, incredulity, the last predominating.  The final name on the list of wedding guests was the name of David Spencer.  David Spencer lived alone in a little cottage down at the Cove.  He was a combination of sailor and fisherman. He was also Isabella Spencer's husband and Rachel's father.  \"Rachel Spencer, have you taken leave of your senses?  What do you mean by such nonsense as this?\"  \"I simply mean that I am going to invite my father to my wedding,\" answered Rachel quietly.  \"Not in my house,\" cried Mrs. Spencer, her lips as white as if her fiery tone had scathed them.  Rachel leaned forward, folded her large, capable hands deliberately on the table, and gazed unflinchingly into her mother's bitter face.  Her fright and nervousness were gone.  Now that the conflict was actually on she found herself rather enjoying it.  She wondered a little at herself, and thought that she must be wicked.  She was not given to self-analysis, or she might have concluded that it was the sudden assertion of her own personality, so long dominated by her mother's, which she was finding so agreeable.  \"Then there will be no wedding, mother,\" she said.  \"Frank and I will simply go to the manse, be married, and go home.  If I cannot invite my father to see me married, no one else shall be invited.\"  Her lips narrowed tightly.  For the first time in her life Isabella Spencer saw a reflection of herself looking back at her from her daughter's face--a strange, indefinable resemblance that was more of soul and spirit than of flesh and blood.  In spite of her anger her heart thrilled to it.  As never before, she realized that this girl was her own and her husband's child, a living bond between them wherein their conflicting natures mingled and were reconciled.  She realized too, that Rachel, so long sweetly meek and obedient, meant to have her own way in this case--and would have it.  \"I must say that I can't see why you are so set on having your father see you married,\" she said with a bitter sneer.  \"HE has never remembered that he is your father.  He cares nothing about you--never did care.\"  Rachel took no notice of this taunt.  It had no power to hurt her, its venom being neutralized by a secret knowledge of her own in which her mother had no share.  \"Either I shall invite my father to my wedding, or I shall not have a wedding,\" she repeated steadily, adopting her mother's own effective tactics of repetition undistracted by argument.  \"Invite him then,\" snapped Mrs. Spencer, with the ungraceful anger of a woman, long accustomed to having her own way, compelled for once to yield.  \"It'll be like chips in porridge anyhow--neither good nor harm.  He won't come.\"  Rachel made no response.  Now that the battle was over, and the victory won, she found herself tremulously on the verge of tears. She rose quickly and went upstairs to her own room, a dim little place shadowed by the white birches growing thickly outside--a virginal room, where everything bespoke the maiden.  She lay down on the blue and white patchwork quilt on her bed, and cried softly and bitterly.  Her heart, at this crisis in her life, yearned for her father, who was almost a stranger to her.  She knew that her mother had probably spoken the truth when she said that he would not come. Rachel felt that her marriage vows would be lacking in some indefinable sacredness if her father were not by to hear them spoken.  Twenty-five years before this, David Spencer and Isabella Chiswick had been married.  Spiteful people said there could be no doubt that Isabella had married David for love, since he had neither lands nor money to tempt her into a match of bargain and sale.  David was a handsome fellow, with the blood of a seafaring race in his veins.  He had been a sailor, like his father and grandfather before him; but, when he married Isabella, she induced him to give up the sea and settle down with her on a snug farm her father had left her. Isabella liked farming, and loved her fertile acres and opulent orchards.  She abhorred the sea and all that pertained to it, less from any dread of its dangers than from an inbred conviction that sailors were \"low\" in the social scale--a species of necessary vagabonds.  In her eyes there was a taint of disgrace in such a calling.  David must be transformed into a respectable, home-abiding tiller of broad lands.  For five years all went well enough.  If, at times, David's longing for the sea troubled him, he stifled it, and listened not to its luring voice.  He and Isabella were very happy; the only drawback to their happiness lay in the regretted fact that they were childless.  Then, in the sixth year, came a crisis and a change.  Captain Barrett, an old crony of David's, wanted him to go with him on a voyage as mate.  At the suggestion all David's long-repressed craving for the wide blue wastes of the ocean, and the wind whistling through the spars with the salt foam in its breath, broke forth with a passion all the more intense for that very repression.  He must go on that voyage with James Barrett--he MUST!  That over, he would be contented again; but go he must. His soul struggled within him like a fettered thing.  Isabella opposed the scheme vehemently and unwisely, with mordant sarcasm and unjust reproaches.  The latent obstinacy of David's character came to the support of his longing--a longing which Isabella, with five generations of land-loving ancestry behind her, could not understand at all.  He was determined to go, and he told Isabella so.  \"I'm sick of plowing and milking cows,\" he said hotly.  \"You mean that you are sick of a respectable life,\" sneered Isabella.  \"Perhaps,\" said David, with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders.  \"Anyway, I'm going.\"  \"If you go on this voyage, David Spencer, you need never come back here,\" said Isabella resolutely.  David had gone; he did not believe that she meant it.  Isabella believed that he did not care whether she meant it or not.  David Spencer left behind him a woman, calm outwardly, inwardly a seething volcano of anger, wounded pride, and thwarted will.  He found precisely the same woman when he came home, tanned, joyous, tamed for a while of his _wanderlust_, ready, with something of real affection, to go back to the farm fields and the stock-yard.  Isabella met him at the door, smileless, cold-eyed, set-lipped.  \"What do you want here?\" she said, in the tone she was accustomed to use to tramps and Syrian peddlers.  \"Want!\" David's surprise left him at a loss for words.  \"Want! Why, I--I--want my wife.  I've come home.\"  \"This is not your home.  I'm no wife of yours.  You made your choice when you went away,\" Isabella had replied.  Then she had gone in, shut the door, and locked it in his face.  David had stood there for a few minutes like a man stunned.  Then he had turned and walked away up the lane under the birches.  He said nothing--then or at any other time.  From that day no reference to his wife or her concerns ever crossed his lips.  He went directly to the harbor, and shipped with Captain Barrett for another voyage.  When he came back from that in a month's time, he bought a small house and had it hauled to the \"Cove,\" a lonely inlet from which no other human habitation was visible. Between his sea voyages he lived there the life of a recluse; fishing and playing his violin were his only employments.  He went nowhere and encouraged no visitors.  Isabella Spencer also had adopted the tactics of silence.  When the scandalized Chiswicks, Aunt Jane at their head, tried to patch up the matter with argument and entreaty, Isabella met them stonily, seeming not to hear what they said, and making no response.  She worsted them totally.  As Aunt Jane said in disgust, \"What can you do with a woman who won't even TALK?\"  Five months after David Spencer had been turned from his wife's door, Rachel was born.  Perhaps, if David had come to them then, with due penitence and humility, Isabella's heart, softened by the pain and joy of her long and ardently desired motherhood might have cast out the rankling venom of resentment that had poisoned it and taken him back into it.  But David had not come; he gave no sign of knowing or caring that his once longed-for child had been born.  When Isabella was able to be about again, her pale face was harder than ever; and, had there been about her any one discerning enough to notice it, there was a subtle change in her bearing and manner.  A certain nervous expectancy, a fluttering restlessness was gone.  Isabella had ceased to hope secretly that her husband would yet come back.  She had in her secret soul thought he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5340"],["title","Further Chronicles of Avonlea (#7)"],["body","would; and she had meant to forgive him when she had humbled him sufficiently, and when he had abased himself as she considered he should.  But now she knew that he did not mean to sue for her forgiveness; and the hate that sprang out of her old love was a rank and speedy and persistent growth.  Rachel, from her earliest recollection, had been vaguely conscious of a difference between her own life and the lives of her playmates.  For a long time it puzzled her childish brain. Finally, she reasoned it out that the difference consisted in the fact that they had fathers and she, Rachel Spencer, had none--not even in the graveyard, as Carrie Bell and Lilian Boulter had. Why was this?  Rachel went straight to her mother, put one little dimpled hand on Isabella Spencer's knee, looked up with great searching blue eyes, and said gravely,  \"Mother, why haven't I got a father like the other little girls?\"  Isabella Spencer laid aside her work, took the seven year old child on her lap, and told her the whole story in a few direct and bitter words that imprinted themselves indelibly on Rachel's remembrance.  She understood clearly and hopelessly that she could never have a father--that, in this respect, she must always be unlike other people.  \"Your father cares nothing for you,\" said Isabella Spencer in conclusion.  \"He never did care.  You must never speak of him to anybody again.\"  Rachel slipped silently from her mother's knee and ran out to the Springtime garden with a full heart.  There she cried passionately over her mother's last words.  It seemed to her a terrible thing that her father should not love her, and a cruel thing that she must never talk of him.  Oddly enough, Rachel's sympathies were all with her father, in as far as she could understand the old quarrel.  She did not dream of disobeying her mother and she did not disobey her.  Never again did the child speak of her father; but Isabella had not forbidden her to think of him, and thenceforth Rachel thought of him constantly--so constantly that, in some strange way, he seemed to become an unguessed-of part of her inner life--the unseen, ever-present companion in all her experiences.  She was an imaginative child, and in fancy she made the acquaintance of her father.  She had never seen him, but he was more real to her than most of the people she had seen.  He played and talked with her as her mother never did; he walked with her in the orchard and field and garden; he sat by her pillow in the twilight; to him she whispered secrets she told to none other.  Once her mother asked her impatiently why she talked so much to herself.  \"I am not talking to myself.  I am talking to a very dear friend of mine,\" Rachel answered gravely.  \"Silly child,\" laughed her mother, half tolerantly, half disapprovingly.  Two years later something wonderful had happened to Rachel.  One summer afternoon she had gone to the harbor with several of her little playmates.  Such a jaunt was a rare treat to the child, for Isabella Spencer seldom allowed her to go from home with anybody but herself.  And Isabella was not an entertaining companion.  Rachel never particularly enjoyed an outing with her mother.  The children wandered far along the shore; at last they came to a place that Rachel had never seen before.  It was a shallow cove where the waters purred on the yellow sands.  Beyond it, the sea was laughing and flashing and preening and alluring, like a beautiful, coquettish woman.  Outside, the wind was boisterous and rollicking; here, it was reverent and gentle.  A white boat was hauled up on the skids, and there was a queer little house close down to the sands, like a big shell tossed up by the waves. Rachel looked on it all with secret delight; she, too, loved the lonely places of sea and shore, as her father had done.  She wanted to linger awhile in this dear spot and revel in it.  \"I'm tired, girls,\" she announced.  \"I'm going to stay here and rest for a spell.  I don't want to go to Gull Point.  You go on yourselves; I'll wait for you here.\"  \"All alone?\" asked Carrie Bell, wonderingly.  \"I'm not so afraid of being alone as some people are,\" said Rachel, with dignity.  The other girls went on, leaving Rachel sitting on the skids, in the shadow of the big white boat.  She sat there for a time dreaming happily, with her blue eyes on the far, pearly horizon, and her golden head leaning against the boat.  Suddenly she heard a step behind her.  When she turned her head a man was standing beside her, looking down at her with big, merry, blue eyes.  Rachel was quite sure that she had never seen him before; yet those eyes seemed to her to have a strangely familiar look.  She liked him.  She felt no shyness nor timidity, such as usually afflicted her in the presence of strangers.  He was a tall, stout man, dressed in a rough fishing suit, and wearing an oilskin cap on his head.  His hair was very thick and curly and fair; his cheeks were tanned and red; his teeth, when he smiled, were very even and white.  Rachel thought he must be quite old, because there was a good deal of gray mixed with his fair hair.  \"Are you watching for the mermaids?\" he said.  Rachel nodded gravely.  From any one else she would have scrupulously hidden such a thought.  \"Yes, I am,\" she said.  \"Mother says there is no such thing as a mermaid, but I like to think there is.  Have you ever seen one?\"  The big man sat down on a bleached log of driftwood and smiled at her.  \"No, I'm sorry to say that I haven't.  But I have seen many other very wonderful things.  I might tell you about some of them, if you would come over here and sit by me.\"  Rachel went unhesitatingly.  When she reached him he pulled her down on his knee, and she liked it.  \"What a nice little craft you are,\" he said.  \"Do you suppose, now, that you could give me a kiss?\"  As a rule, Rachel hated kissing.  She could seldom be prevailed upon to kiss even her uncles--who knew it and liked to tease her for kisses until they aggravated her so terribly that she told them she couldn't bear men.  But now she promptly put her arms about this strange man's neck and gave him a hearty smack.  \"I like you,\" she said frankly.  She felt his arms tighten suddenly about her.  The blue eyes looking into hers grew misty and very tender.  Then, all at once, Rachel knew who he was.  He was her father.  She did not say anything, but she laid her curly head down on his shoulder and felt a great happiness, as of one who had come into some longed-for haven.  If David Spencer realized that she understood he said nothing. Instead, he began to tell her fascinating stories of far lands he had visited, and strange things he had seen.  Rachel listened entranced, as if she were hearkening to a fairy tale.  Yes, he was just as she had dreamed him.  She had always been sure he could tell beautiful stories.  \"Come up to the house and I'll show you some pretty things,\" he said finally.  Then followed a wonderful hour.  The little low-ceilinged room, with its square window, into which he took her, was filled with the flotsam and jetsam of his roving life--things beautiful and odd and strange beyond all telling.  The things that pleased Rachel most were two huge shells on the chimney piece--pale pink shells with big crimson and purple spots.  \"Oh, I didn't know there could be such pretty things in the world,\" she exclaimed.  \"If you would like,\" began the big man; then he paused for a moment.  \"I'll show you something prettier still.\"  Rachel felt vaguely that he meant to say something else when he began; but she forgot to wonder what it was when she saw what he brought out of a little corner cupboard.  It was a teapot of some fine, glistening purple ware, coiled over by golden dragons with gilded claws and scales.  The lid looked like a beautiful golden flower and the handle was a coil of a dragon's tail.  Rachel sat and looked at it rapt-eyed.  \"That's the only thing of any value I have in the world--now,\" he said.  Rachel knew there was something very sad in his eyes and voice. She longed to kiss him again and comfort him.  But suddenly he began to laugh, and then he rummaged out some goodies for her to eat, sweetmeats more delicious than she had ever imagined.  While she nibbled them he took down an old violin and played music that made her want to dance and sing.  Rachel was perfectly happy. She wished she might stay forever in that low, dim room with all its treasures.  \"I see your little friends coming around the point,\" he said, finally.  \"I suppose you must go.  Put the rest of the goodies in your pocket.\"  He took her up in his arms and held her tightly against his breast for a single moment.  She felt him kissing her hair.  \"There, run along, little girl.  Good-by,\" he said gently.  \"Why don't you ask me to come and see you again?\" cried Rachel, half in tears.  \"I'm coming ANYHOW.\"  \"If you can come, COME,\" he said.  \"If you don't come, I shall know it is because you can't--and that is much to know.  I'm very, very, VERY glad, little woman, that you have come once.\"  Rachel was sitting demurely on the skids when her companions came back.  They had not seen her leaving the house, and she said not a word to them of her experiences.  She only smiled mysteriously when they asked her if she had been lonesome.  That night, for the first time, she mentioned her father's name in her prayers.  She never forgot to do so afterwards.  She always said, \"bless mother--and father,\" with an instinctive pause between the two names--a pause which indicated new realization of the tragedy which had sundered them.  And the tone in which she said \"father\" was softer and more tender than the one which voiced \"mother.\"  Rachel never visited the Cove again.  Isabella Spencer discovered that the children had been there, and, although she knew nothing of Rachel's interview with her father, she told the child that she must never again go to that part of the shore.  Rachel shed many a bitter tear "]]]
