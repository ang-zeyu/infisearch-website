Because they alone had something to lose. The first notion --that of equality, threatened at once to make them doubt their own privileges and powers, to throw suspicion into the hearts of their followers, and to make all special, exceptional and isolated claims utterly void. The third--the insistence upon a truth which could be general and absolute, denied their right to establish their own truths in the hearts of men, and to rise above the most general truth which was reality; while in the second--the Semitic doctrine of general sin, which held that man was not only an imperfect, but also a fallen being, and that all his kind shared in this shame--there was not alone the ring of an absence of rank, but also of a universal depreciation of human nature which was ultimately to lead, by gradual stages, from a disbelief in man himself to a disbelief in nobles, in kings and finally in gods.[18]  At one stroke, not one or two human actions, but all human performances, inspirations and happy thoughts, had been stripped of their glory and condemned. Man could raise himself only by God's grace --that is to say, by a miracle, otherwise he was but a fallen angel, aimlessly beating the air with his broken wings.  These three blows levelled at the head of higher men were fatal to the artist; for it is precisely in the value of human inspirations, in the efficiency of human creativeness, and in the irresistible power of human will, that he, above all, must and does believe. It is his mission to demand obedience and to procure reverence; for, as we shall see, every artist worthy the name is at heart a despot.[19]  Fortunately, the Holy Catholic Church intervened, and by its rigorous discipline and its firm establishment upon a hierarchical principle, suppressed for a while the overweening temper of the Christian soul, and all claims of individual thought and judgment, while it also recognized an order of rank among men; but the three doctrines above described remained notwithstanding at the core of the Christian Faith, and awaited only a favourable opportunity to burst forth and blight all the good that the Church had done.  This favourable opportunity occurred in the person of Martin Luther. The Reformation, in addition to reinstating, with all their evil consequences, the three doctrines mentioned above, also produced a certain contempt for lofty things and an importunate individualism which has done nought but increase and spread from that day to this.  Individualism, on a large scale, of course, had been both tolerated and practised in Gothic architecture, and on this account the buildings of the Middle Ages might be said to breathe a more truly Christian spirit[20] than most of the sculpture and the painting of the same period, which are more hieratic.[21] But it was not until the Reformation began to spread that the most tiresome form of individualism, which we shall call Amateurism,[22] received, as it were, a Divine sanction; and there can be no doubt that it is against this element in modern life that not only Art, but all forces which aim at order, law and discipline, will eventually have to wage their most determined and most implacable warfare.   [13] The Judaic story of the fall of man is at bottom an essentially democratic one. This absence of rank in sin had no parallel in the aristocratic Pagan world. Likewise, in the manner of the fall, there is a total absence of noble qualities. \"Curiosity, beguilement, seductibility and wantonness--in short, a whole series of pre-eminently feminine passions--were regarded as the origin of evil.\" See _B. T._, pp. 78, 79.  [14] Bury, _History of the Later Roman Empire_, Vol. I, p. 33.  [15] _A._, Aph. 43 and 64.  [16] _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, No. 435.  [17] _Ibid_., No. 522.  [18] _W. P._, Vol. II, p. 312: \"When it occurs to inferior men to doubt that higher men exist, then the danger is great,\" etc. See, in fact, the whole of Aph. 874.  [19] See _A._, Aph. 49: \"The concept of guilt and punishment, inclusive of the doctrine of 'grace,' of 'salvation,' and of 'forgiveness'--lies through and through, without a shred of psychological truth. Sin,... this form of human self-violation _par excellence_, was invented solely for the purpose of making all science, all culture, and every kind of elevation and nobility utterly impossible.\"  [20] Ruskin, _On the Nature of Gothic Architecture_ (p. 7), contrasting the classic and Gothic style, says: \"... In the medi√¶val, or especially Christian, system of ornament, this slavery [_i.e._ the slavery imposed by the classic canon] is done away with altogether; Christianity having recognized, in small things as well as great, the individual value of every soul.\"  [21] In a good deal of the painting and sculpture of the pre-Renaissance period, too, signs were not lacking which showed that the Christian ideal of truth was beginning to work its effects by leading to a realism which I have classified in Lecture II as Police Art. Of course, a good deal of this realism may also be accounted for by the reasons which I suggest at the end of Part I of Lecture III; be this as it may, however, as it is difficult to decide the actual proportion of either of these influences, the weight of the Christian doctrine of Truth must not be altogether overlooked in such productions as Donatello's \"Crucifixion\" (Capella Bardi, S. Croce, Florence); Masolino's \"Raising of Tabitha\" (Carmine, Florence); Masaccio's Fresco (S. Maria del Carmine, Florence); Ucello's \"Rout of S. Romano\" (Uffizi); Andrea del Castagno's \"Crucifixion\" (in the Monastery of the Angeli, Florence); and the really beautiful statues of the Founders in the Cathedral of Naumburg.  [22] _W. P._, Vol. II, p. 297: \"The terrible consequences of 'freedom'--in the end everybody thinks he has the right to every problem. All order of rank is banished.\"     B. Protestantism.   For Protestantism was nothing more nor less than a general rebellion against authority.[23] By means of it the right of private judgment was installed once more, and to the individual was restored that importance which Christianity had acknowledged from the first, and which only the attitude of the Church had been able to modify. The layman, with his conscience acknowledged to be the supreme tribunal, was declared a free man, emancipated even from the law,[24] or, as Luther said, \"free Lord of all, subject to none.\"[25]  Now, not only the immortal soul of every individual became important; but also every one of his proclivities, desires and aspirations. He was told that he could be his own priest if he chose,[26] and that Christ had obtained this prerogative for him. Megalomania, in fact, as Nietzsche declares, was made his duty.[27]  \"Let men so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.\"[28]  With these words St. Paul had addressed the Corinthians, and Luther did not fail to base his strongest arguments upon the text.[29]  \"Even the Reformation,\" says Nietzsche, \"was a movement for individual liberty; 'Every one his own priest' is really no more than a formula for _libertinage_.As a matter of fact, the words, 'Evangelical freedom' would have sufficed--and all instincts which had reasons for remaining concealed broke out like wild hounds, the most brutal needs suddenly acquired the courage to show themselves, everything seemed justified.\"[30]  Was it at all likely that the formula, \"Every one his own priest,\" was going to lead to trouble only in ecclesiastical matters? As a matter of fact we know that Luther himself extended the principle still further in his own lifetime. By his radical alterations in the church service Luther gave the laity a much more prominent place in Divine worship than they had ever had before; for, in addition to the fact that the liturgy as compiled by him was written almost entirely in the native tongue, the special attention he gave to the singing of hymns[31] allowed the people an opportunity of displaying their individual powers to such an extent that it has even been said that \"they sang themselves into enthusiasm for the new faith.\"[31]  But these remarkable changes were only symbolic of the changes that followed elsewhere; for, once this spirit of individual liberty and judgment had invaded that department of life which theretofore had been held most sacred, what was there to prevent it from entering and defiling less sacred sanctuaries?  Bearing in mind the condition of the arts at the present day, and taking into account a fact which we all very well know; namely, that thousands upon thousands are now practising these arts who have absolutely no business to be associated with them in any way, we are almost inclined to forgive Protestantism and Puritanism their smashing of our images, and their material iconoclasm; so light does this damage appear, compared with the other indirect damage they have done to the spirit of Art, by establishing the fatal precedent of allowing everybody to touch and speak of everything--however sacred.  We may argue with Buckle that the English spirit is of a kind which is essentially Protestant in temper; but this only seems to make the matter worse.  When Cardinal Newman and Matthew Arnold point, the one to the evils of Liberalism, and the other to the evils of anarchy, we know to what they are referring. They are referring to the impossibility, nowadays, of awakening reverence for anything or for anybody.  \"May not every man in England say what he likes?\" Matthew Arnold exclaims. \"But,\" he continues, \"the aspirations of culture, which is the study of perfection, are not satisfied, unless what men say, when they may say what they like, is worth saying.... Culture indefatigably tries, not to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],["title","Wastralls: A Novel (#0)"],["body","*Wastralls*                                 *A Novel*                                      By                            C.

From the source to the engulfing sands was barely a mile, and the twinkling waters, if full and fierce in winter, showed a summer fear of their own broad stepping-stones. Nevertheless the sharp declivities, the juttings of rock, even the shelves and crags and walls of Dark Head, had been formed by the gnawing of this tiny but persistent flow.  The valley ran east and west.  The sun, rising beyond St. Cadic Mill, poured its noon warmth over Hember and sank behind the sheltered plateau on which stood the old home of the Rosevears.  The dying beams, however, could not reach the deep-set windows of Wastralls, for the crest of Dark Head reared itself between the farmstead and the harsh threat of the Atlantic.  The house lay in a fold of land, hidden equally from those who moved upon the face of the waters, and those who might be said, though their habitations were at a distance, to neighbour it.  As a refuge in troublous times, the position had its value, and there were indications that this shelf of rock had been, many centuries ago, the nest of some wild brood.  Upon their heels had followed as descendants or conquerors‚Äîthe script is too nearly obliterated to be read‚Äîmen who in their own strong person represented the law.  The gate-posts of Wastralls were crowned with the egg-shaped stones which indicated that it was a manor-house, and that its owner had the right to dispense justice.  Within the house, and occupying a space from wall to wall, was the ancient Justice Room; but its stately uses had long been abated, its irrevocable decisions had lost their force, in the autumn of its days it had become a lumber-room and more lately a bedchamber.  A century ago, from the mill at the head of the valley to the Wreckers‚Äô Hut on the foreshore, Trevorrick had been the property of one man.  Of peasant stock, how Freathy Rosevear came by land and money was matter of surmise.  ‚ÄôHe had gone out one morning a poor man, and had come home rich.‚Äô  Little need, however, to invent tales of hidden treasure, witchcraft, divination, when the caves in Morwen Cove made so safe a store-house: when the Wreckers‚Äô Hut stood behind the teeth of the Mad Rip: when the lanes that converged upon the towns‚Äîthe towns in which queer commodities could always be sold‚Äîwere so deep and secret. Whatever the sources of his income, as fortunes went, in that remote district, Freathy Rosevear was accounted wealthy.  He was also a man to take the eye.  Big, florid, fair, he might have stepped out of a Holbein canvas, and tales of his unusual strength were told and retold of a winter‚Äôs evening in the cottages.  Did his wife complain the store of wreck was running low?  Forthwith he had gone out, caught the first of the homing donkeys, and carried it, load and all, into her presence, with \"A fardel for my Lady\"‚Äîso the story.  The man was as Saul to a kingless folk, a head and shoulders above the multitude.  Like the last of the Tudor monarchs he brought the people among whom he lived material well-being, and, like other outstanding personalities, stamped his impress on the current coin. Before he died he was \"Old Squire\" and, as such, he lived in the long memory of the countryside.  Not that to them his death was the final exit from the stage of his influence and activities.  Though they followed him to his burying, though they saw the sods falling earth to earth, they could not believe that abundant, penetrating, imperial vitality could be resolved into its elements. Recognizing that neither heaven nor hell was the fitting place for it, they showed their faith in the life after death by a hardy belief that Old Squire, though rendered invisible, was still among them.  When this man‚Äôs grip upon Trevorrick relaxed, the land fell to his three legitimate sons: for his other children, and he had done his part in peopling the neighbourhood, he had provided during his life.  The legitimate sons, Freathy, Constantine, and Tom, were good farmers all, but cast in an ordinary mould.  They lived, they replenished the earth and, in the fullness of time, went back to it, dust to dust.  A younger Constantine now owned the mill, a younger Tom tilled the fat slopes of Hember, and Wastralls, the cradle of the race, was become the property of Freathy‚Äôs only child, his daughter Sabina.  Every rood of land in the valley was still Rosevear property, and the cousins, shut in by their hill boundaries, formed a community conscious at once of its kinship and its isolation.  Of the three farms, Wastralls was the largest and most important. Across the valley were wide commons‚Äîthe wastralls‚Äîonce bare, blown sand, but now converted by spire grass into turf for the fattening of red-brown bullocks.  On the heavy land between the house and the little stream were orchards and cornfields, while behind the cliffs, tethered in pairs to prevent them being blown over the edge, a flock of sheep nibbled the short grass.  The manor itself was a low two-storied oblong of country stone and, with its courts and outhouses, seemed as much an excrescence of the rocky ground as more solid outcroppings.  A grey irregularity by day, it sank, when twilight fell, into its surroundings. At dawn St. Cadic Mill was a black tower against the saffron; at dusk Hember windows flamed with reflections of the west; but both at dawn and dusk Wastralls was more a presumption than a fact.  The house was older than Hember, older than the mill, and its obscurity suggested that the forgotten builder had hoped the Storm-god might take Wastralls in his stride, that Death might fail, among so many grey swells and hummocks, to distinguish it.  The place had been built to house two families.  A dividing wall cut the fine chambers on the western front from the low-pitched rooms that looked across the yard. A green door, stout and with a heavy lock, was set in the dividing wall to allow of communication between the old-time lord of the manor and the bailiff who tilled his fields; but the families, living back to back, having different modes of egress and ingress, the one taking the field path, the other the road, preserved each its privacy. When Old Squire brought a wife to Wastralls, she, preferring the homeliness of the farmstead, had made it their dwelling-place.  From thenceforward the life of the house centred in the roomy, whitewashed kitchen; and the fine chambers, swept and shuttered, were only used on ceremonial occasions.  Old Squire had no use for state or trappings and when his son Freathy reigned in his stead, the lesser man asked no greater luxury than had satisfied his sire.  This second Freathy married a woman so indistinct that it was a wonder he had seen her sufficiently well to fall in love.  She ruled Wastralls with a boneless hand, and used her knees for praying rather than scrubbing. Of this vague, colourless creature was born the vital bright-haired Sabina.  Her father welcomed her as a beginning, \"first a maid and then a child,\" but his wife‚Äôs effort left her exhausted.  The tonic air of the valley made it difficult for her to die, but she failed a little, month by month, until, unnoticed, she was able to slip into her grave.  Freathy‚Äôs thought was \"must marry again, try to get a boy; ‚Äôtwon‚Äôt do to let a maid be heir of the land.\"  But he was comfortable as a widower, more comfortable than he had been during Dusha‚Äôs pious, slatternly existence and, Time, the inexorable, drew the daisy quilt about his neck, while he yet procrastinated.  For lack of a son Freathy had taken his daughter with him about the farm.  His thoughts being of the cattle-market, of soils and crops, it was of such matters that he spoke; and Sabina picked up the lore of the seasons as naturally as another child learns to sew and cook.  Her father was a man who drank, not continuously, but at intervals which, like a perspective of posts, showed diminishing interspaces.  The child accepted his habits as she accepted rain and shine and, when he was under the influence of liquor, did her young best to grapple with his duties.  By the time he died‚Äîfrom the effects of a night spent inadvertently in the open‚Äîshe had gathered a little store of experience, had indeed been farming Wastralls for over a year.  Freathy, intending to remarry and leave hearty sons, had not troubled to make a will and the girl of one-and-twenty succeeded to an unencumbered freehold of five hundred acres, the manor-house and what remained of Old Squire‚Äôs savings.  Offers of help came from both Hember and St. Cadic. Each was willing to work Wastralls with his own land, each hoped Sabina might listen to a cousinly tale of love.  She, however, having inherited the robust confidence of her grandfather, was determined to undertake on her own account the adventure of farming.  Nor were Tom and Constantine Rosevear altogether surprised. They had not played with her as children without recognizing her quality; and if they wondered ‚Äôwhat hand she‚Äôd make of it,‚Äô it was as those whose hearts prophesy unto them.  The brothers who had inherited Hember and St. Cadic had died young, but"]]]
