Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman. And when they were quite old, the old woman said to her husband \"How shall these our children get food when we are gone?\" So the old man travelled afar to the great god Kuvera, [26] the god of riches, and, taking from him seedlings of paddy, pulse, mustard, and gourds, journeyed for eight days and so reached his home. And after staying a couple of days, he set forth to cultivate, taking dry food with him. And first he marked out a piece of rich land by placing boundaries on all four sides of it, and so came home. And again he set out another day with hoe and axe, and cut and burned the jungle, and cleaned the soil, and after worshipping on each side of his field--on the east and on the west, on the north and on the south--he struck one blow with his hoe on each side.  And when all was ready, the old man planted his seedlings of various sorts, and finally went home and rested. And so, as time went by, the old woman desired vehemently to see how the crops were getting on. But the old man said \"There is no water on the road, and if you grow athirst, you will get no relief.\" But she persisted and prevailed, and made her husband take her along. And as they went, and were now quite close to her husband's field, behold, the old woman began to be very thirsty. And the old man, being enraged, cried \"What did I tell you? There is no water, and yet you would come.\" But she, being a woman, said \"If you do not give me to drink, I shall die. So, water you must procure as best you can.\" So the old man, seeing no other way, went to seek for water. And after long search, seeing a tank, he bound the old woman's eyes with a cloth and dragged her to the water's edge and said to her \"Drink if you will, but look not upon the tank.\" Now the ducks and other water fowls were playing in the water, and were making a merry noise, clacking and quacking. And, the old woman, being curious, like all her sex, peeped at them. And, seeing them at their play, she too desired to be happy in her husband's society, and, though he was very loth, prevailed with him. And so in due course there were born to them many sons and daughters. And then, in order to provide for their food, he journeyed to the Himalayas and digged a great tank, stocked with many kinds of fishes.  Now, one day the god Sri, the god of good luck, came that way with his white dog, ahunting for deer and hares and tortoises. And when he came to the margin of the tank, behold he was very thirsty. But when he stooped to drink, the fishes said to him eagerly that he must grant them a boon in return for their water. To which he assented, and when he had satisfied his thirst, the fishes said \"Take us to the great river, the Brahmaputra (or Lohit).\" So the god Sri tied them to his staff, and drew them after him, making runnels of water. And that is how the rivers were made. And the fishes in return gave him a pumpkin and a gourd. And, taking these with him to a friend's house, his friend regaled him with rice"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],["title","A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#8)"],["body","and pig's flesh, and in the morning he gave his friend the pumpkin. But when his friend cut open the pumpkin, it contained nothing but pure silver. So he bade the god Sri stay another day, and brewed fresh beer and killed another pig, and when he was going away gave him a flitch of bacon to take with him. So the god Sri gave him also the gourd. But when he cut open the gourd, it contained nothing but pure gold. And so the god Sri journeyed to his home. And when he got there, he found that his little daughter was very ill. And that was because he had given away the presents which the fishes had made him. But the fishes took pity on him, and came to him in the guise of physicians, and told him that if he would worship and do sacrifice on the banks of rivers, then his daughter would be healed, which he did. And that is why we Kacharis worship rivers. And that is all.      THE STORY OF THE LAZY BOY.  There was once a very lazy boy. And when everybody else had planted out his paddy, he was only setting forth to plough. But the old man of the season, [27] seeing him, said \"The season has gone; what are you ploughing for now? The paddy is all planted out, and it is late.\" But the boy would not listen to him, and ploughed sturdily ahead, beating his cattle soundly as he went. And when the old man again and again questioned him, he cried \"What sort of an old man is this? Can he not see that I am busy? I know very well what I am about.\" But the old man said gently \"Nay, my son: but it is for your good that I would speak to you.\" And the boy said \"Speak quickly then, and have done with it.\" And the old man said \"My son, the season is gone, what avails it to plough now?\" And then the boy cried \"Where has it gone? And when has it gone? And why has it gone? And how shall I find it?\" But the old man of the season said \"You should have ploughed when others did. The season has gone, and no man can bring it back.\" But the boy said \"I must bring it back, else, how shall I eat, and how shall I live? Do tell me where it is gone.\" And as he would not let the god go, finally, losing patience, he said \"You go over there, and you will find an old man with a snow-white head ploughing in a field. You get hold of him and do as he tells you.\" So saying, he made his escape. Then the lad hastened home to his mother and bade her cook supper quickly, and tie him up some rice to take with him on the morrow, for he was going to bring back the departed season for ploughing.  \"For\" said he \"when I was ploughing today, an old man told me that the season was gone, and that if I went after him and pursued him I would find him, and that I must do as he would tell me.\" So she rose very early in the morning, and giving him to eat and drink, set him on his way. And as he went, he asked all he met \"Can you tell me where the old man of the season has gone?\" But they said \"Every one knows that the season is gone, but where it has gone, or why it has gone, who can say?\" At last, when he was nearly in despair, he saw an old man ploughing afar off, and shouted to him \"Stay a moment, father, stay; I want to ask you a question.\" But the old man was busy, and went his ways. But the lad pursued him and never ceased calling after him till at last the old man, losing patience, turned upon him, and said \"What pertinacious noisy lad is this, who won't leave me alone?\" But the lad said \"Be not angry, my father, I am fallen into great trouble, and it behoves you to help me.\" \"Speak quickly, then,\" said the old man. And the boy said \"I take you to be the old man of the season, and I pray you not to slay me. All the others have planted out their paddy, and I have fallen behind, and have planted nothing. Therefore, unless you turn back, I cannot hope to get any harvest.\" But the old man said \"It is too late for me to return. Go you back, and plant your paddy as best you can.\" And so the lad hastened back and planted out his seedlings in such heedless haste as became him. And that's all!      THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS.  An old man and an old woman had a son. But the father died while his son was yet a child, and the mother brought up her boy by begging from house to house. When he was big enough he begged his mother to let him engage himself as a cowherd. But she said \"As long as I live, I must not let you undergo any trouble.\" But the gallant boy would not listen, and went and took service as a cowherd. But the other cowherd boys would not let him go out herding with them, and hated him, and beat him, in spite of the help of a good old man who took him into his house, so, being unable to stay any longer for grief and vexation, he went away into foreign lands.  And as he went his ways, he met Simli Bîr, the hero of the simul tree, and when he saw him he said \"Ah! here is a hero indeed, seeing that you bear a whole silk-cotton tree on your shoulder.\" But the other replied \"Whom do you call a hero? I am no hero at all. If you want a real hero, look out for Gilâ Charan.\" But the lad said \"As for Gilâ Charan, why, I am Gilâ Charan.\" On which Simli Bîr got leave to go with him. And as they went they met Dhop Bîr, and to him they said \"You are something like a hero. Why, you are carrying a whole dhop tree all by yourself.\" But the other said \"My brothers, of what account am I? The man they call Gilâ Charan, he is a hero if you like.\" Then Gilâ Charan said \"But I am he.\" On which Dhop Bîr said \"Let me come with you too.\"  And, so saying, he too joined the party. And in like manner they were joined by other four champions, namely, Mustard, Monkey, Ocean, and Fire, six in all, besides Gilâ Charan.  And when they had gone some way, one of them went into the house of a Râkshashani to beg fire for cooking. But when the old wretch saw that it was a man, she desired to devour him, and to that end lay still, pretending to be ill, and said to him in a weak voice \"The fire is quite close to me. Come and blow it up!\" and when he came close, she gave him a kick and sent him flying into a pit; and, seeing that he did not come, another champion went on the same quest and was treated in like fashion. Then Gilâ Charan guessed that something out of the way had happened, and went there himself; and, perceiving that the old woman was a vampire, took her by the throat and shook her well. But she cried \"Do not kill me, and I will show you where your friends are.\" Then the old woman got a ladder and released the two champions from the pit. Whereupon they killed her, and went on their way rejoicing.  And presently they came to a place where Rakshashas dwelt. But, not knowing this, they left Simli Bîr to cook rice and the rest went hunting. And when the rice was ready, two Rakshashas came and gobbled it up, so when the rest returned, hungry, for food, Simlî Bîr said he was very sorry. He had quite forgotten to cook, being very busy watching a beautiful white butterfly. But Gilâ Charan at once saw that was only a pretext. So he bid the rest go, and, staying behind, himself cooked rice afresh. On which the two Rakshashas came up roaring, and said \"Here, my son, hand over that rice.\" \"But,\" said Gilâ Charan, undaunted, \"we are hungry ourselves and have no rice to spare!\" \"What!\" cried they \"shall a scarcely weaned child speak to us like this?\" and they ran at him to eat him. But he seized them by their necks and threw them a field's length. And when they attacked him afresh, he slew them with his sword. And in like manner each of the Bîrs slew each his Rakshasha, and then each married a fair Rakshasha girl, and lived happily ever afterwards. And that's all!      THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT'S SON.  There was a lad whose father died while he was a child. And when, by slow degrees, he came to man's estate, he asked his mother one day how his father got a living. But she heaved a long sigh, and at last said \"Your father traded in foreign countries, my dear; and if he were alive now, we would not be in such distress now.\" But he said \"Ah! mother, may not I work at the same trade? Give me all the money there is, and let me too go trading.\" But his mother said \"Nay! my son, do not say that. While I live, even if I have to beg, you shall not want. And if you die in strange lands, what is to become of me?\" But her son would not hearken to her, and, begging money from her, bought merchandise, and hired a boat, and took two men with him; and, after doing obeisance to his mother, set forth into strange lands. And at last he moored his boat at the ghat of a certain village, and sent his men out to hawk his goods. But he himself stayed with the boat. And at that ghat dwelt an aged couple, who possessed a white and beautiful swan which they cherished as their own child, and fed with their own food. And one day at midday, when men were enjoying their siesta, the merchant lad saw the white swan remove her swan dress and bathe in the river, a lovely slim maiden. Whereupon he began to pay great regard to the old couple, and gave them of his store without money. But as time went by, all his goods were disposed of, and then he went to the old people and offered them a great price for their swan. Nor when they would give it to him for nothing would he accept it, seeing that it were a sin to take a wife as a gift. So, finally he made them take much money and went away home, taking his swan with him. But when he reached home, behold the swan remained a swan, and the lad was sore vexed and lost his sleep and his food, so that his mother was in fear, and asked sundry of the villagers what might be the matter.  And, finally, one of them, who was a wise woman, said to her: \"Something has happened to him while he was away trading, and now you must find out what it was. And the way to do it is this: You must get a fair girl to comb his hair; and let her pretend to grieve that he is so ill, and let her cry into his hair, and to a fair maiden he will tell what he would never say to his mother.\" So a girl came and combed his hair, and wept"]]]
