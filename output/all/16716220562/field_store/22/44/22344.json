Thenceforth there had been no communication between her and her father, save the unworded messages of soul to soul across whatever may divide them.  David Spencer's invitation to his daughter's wedding was sent with the others, and the remaining days of Rachel's maidenhood slipped away in a whirl of preparation and excitement in which her mother reveled, but which was distasteful to the girl.  The wedding day came at last, breaking softly and fairly over the great sea in a sheen of silver and pearl and rose, a September day, as mild and beautiful as June.  The ceremony was to be performed at eight o'clock in the evening. At seven Rachel stood in her room, fully dressed and alone.  She had no bridesmaid, and she had asked her cousins to leave her to herself in this last solemn hour of girlhood.  She looked very fair and sweet in the sunset-light that showered through the birches.  Her wedding gown was a fine, sheer organdie, simply and daintily made.  In the loose waves of her bright hair she wore her bridegroom's flowers, roses as white as a virgin's dream. She was very happy; but her happiness was faintly threaded with the sorrow inseparable from all change.  Presently her mother came in, carrying a small basket.  \"Here is something for you, Rachel.  One of the boys from the harbor brought it up.  He was bound to give it into your own hands--said that was his orders.  I just took it and sent him to the right-about--told him I'd give it to you at once, and that that was all that was necessary.\"  She spoke coldly.  She knew quite well who had sent the basket, and she resented it; but her resentment was not quite strong enough to overcome her curiosity.  She stood silently by while Rachel unpacked the basket.  Rachel's hands trembled as she took off the cover.  Two huge pink-spotted shells came first.  How well she remembered them! Beneath them, carefully wrapped up in a square of foreign-looking, strangely scented silk, was the dragon teapot. She held it in her hands and gazed at it with tears gathering thickly in her eyes.  \"Your father sent that,\" said Isabella Spencer with an odd sound in her voice.  \"I remember it well.  It was among the things I packed up and sent after him.  His father had brought it home from China fifty years ago, and he prized it beyond anything. They used to say it was worth a lot of money.\"  \"Mother, please leave me alone for a little while,\" said Rachel, imploringly.  She had caught sight of a little note at the bottom of the basket, and she felt that she could not read it under her mother's eyes.  Mrs. Spencer went out with unaccustomed acquiescence, and Rachel went quickly to the window, where she read her letter by the fading gleams of twilight.  It was very brief, and the writing was that of a man who holds a pen but seldom.      \"My dear little girl,\" it ran, \"I'm sorry I can't go to your     wedding.  It was like you to ask me--for I know it was your     doing.  I wish I could see you married, but I can't go to the     house I was turned out of.  I hope you will be very happy.  I     am sending you the shells and teapot you liked so much.  Do     you remember that day we had such a good time?  I would liked     to have seen you again before you were married, but it can't     be.                                             \"Your loving father,                                            \"DAVID SPENCER.\"  Rachel resolutely blinked away the tears that filled her eyes.  A fierce desire for her father sprang up in her heart--an insistent hunger that would not be denied.  She MUST see her father; she MUST have his blessing on her new life.  A sudden determination took possession of her whole being--a determination to sweep aside all conventionalities and objections as if they had not been.  It was now almost dark.  The guests would not be coming for half an hour yet.  It was only fifteen minutes' walk over the hill to the Cove.  Hastily Rachel shrouded herself in her new raincoat, and drew a dark, protecting hood over her gay head.  She opened the door and slipped noiselessly downstairs.  Mrs. Spencer and her assistants were all busy in the back part of the house.  In a moment Rachel was out in the dewy garden.  She would go straight over the fields.  Nobody would see her.  It was quite dark when she reached the Cove.  In the crystal cup of the sky over her the stars were blinking.  Flying flakes of foam were scurrying over the sand like elfin things.  A soft little wind was crooning about the eaves of the little gray house where David Spencer was sitting, alone in the twilight, his violin on his knee.  He had been trying to play, but could not. His heart yearned after his daughter--yes, and after a long-estranged bride of his youth.  His love of the sea was sated forever; his love for wife and child still cried for its own under all his old anger and stubbornness.  The door opened suddenly and the very Rachel of whom he was dreaming came suddenly in, flinging off her wraps and standing forth in her young beauty and bridal adornments, a splendid creature, almost lighting up the gloom with her radiance.  \"Father,\" she cried, brokenly, and her father's eager arms closed around her.  Back in the house she had left, the guests were coming to the wedding.  There were jests and laughter and friendly greeting. The bridegroom came, too, a slim, dark-eyed lad who tiptoed bashfully upstairs to the spare room, from which he presently emerged to confront Mrs. Spencer on the landing.  \"I want to see Rachel before we go down,\" he said, blushing.  Mrs. Spencer deposited a wedding present of linen on the table which was already laden with gifts, opening the door of Rachel's room, and called her.  There was no reply; the room was dark and still.  In sudden alarm, Isabella Spencer snatched the lamp from the hall table and held it up.  The little white room was empty. No blushing, white-clad bride tenanted it.  But David Spencer's letter was lying on the stand.  She caught it up and read it.  \"Rachel is gone,\" she gasped.  A flash of intuition had revealed to her where and why the girl had gone.  \"Gone!\" echoed Frank, his face blanching.  His pallid dismay recalled Mrs. Spencer to herself.  She gave a bitter, ugly little laugh.  \"Oh, you needn't look so scared, Frank.  She hasn't run away from you.  Hush; come in here--shut the door.  Nobody must know of this.  Nice gossip it would make!  That little fool has gone to the Cove to see her--her father.  I know she has.  It's just like what she would do.  He sent her those presents--look--and this letter.  Read it.  She has gone to coax him to come and see her married.  She was crazy about it.  And the minister is here and it is half-past seven.  She'll ruin her dress and shoes in the dust and dew.  And what if some one has seen her!  Was there ever such a little fool?\"  Frank's presence of mind had returned to him.  He knew all about Rachel and her father.  She had told him everything.  \"I'll go after her,\" he said gently.  \"Get me my hat and coat. I'll slip down the back stairs and over to the Cove.\"  \"You must get out of the pantry window, then,\" said Mrs. Spencer firmly, mingling comedy and tragedy after her characteristic fashion.  \"The kitchen is full of women.  I won't have this known and talked about if it can possibly be helped.\"  The bridegroom, wise beyond his years in the knowledge that it was well to yield to women in little things, crawled obediently out of the pantry window and darted through the birch wood.  Mrs. Spencer had stood quakingly on guard until he had disappeared.  So Rachel had gone to her father!  Like had broken the fetters of years and fled to like.  \"It isn't much use fighting against nature, I guess,\" she thought grimly.  \"I'm beat.  He must have thought something of her, after all, when he sent her that teapot and letter.  And what does he mean about the 'day they had such a good time'?  Well, it just means that she's been to see him before, sometime, I suppose, and kept me in ignorance of it all.\"  Mrs. Spencer shut down the pantry window with a vicious thud.  \"If only she'll come quietly back with Frank in time to prevent gossip I'll forgive her,\" she said, as she turned to the kitchen.  Rachel was sitting on her father's knee, with both her white arms around his neck, when Frank came in.  She sprang up, her face flushed and appealing, her eyes bright and dewy with tears. Frank thought he had never seen her look so lovely.  \"Oh, Frank, is it very late?  Oh, are you angry?\" she exclaimed timidly.  \"No, no, dear.  Of course I'm not angry.  But don't you think you'd better come back now?  It's nearly eight and everybody is waiting.\"  \"I've been trying to coax father to come up and see me married,\" said Rachel.  \"Help me, Frank.\"  \"You'd better come, sir,\" said Frank, heartily, \"I'd like it as much as Rachel would.\"  David Spencer shook his head stubbornly.  \"No, I can't go to that house.  I was locked out of it.  Never mind me.  I've had my happiness in this half hour with my little girl.  I'd like to see her married, but it isn't to be.\"  \"Yes, it is to be--it shall be,\" said Rachel resolutely.  \"You SHALL see me married.  Frank, I'm going to be married here in my father's house!  That is the right place for a girl to be married.  Go back and tell the guests so, and bring them all down.\"  Frank looked rather dismayed.  David Spencer said deprecatingly: \"Little girl, don't you think it would be--\"  \"I'm going to have my own way in this,\" said Rachel, with a sort of tender finality.  \"Go, Frank.  I'll obey you all my life after, but you must do this for me.  Try to understand,\" she added beseechingly.  \"Oh, I understand,\" Frank reassured her.  \"Besides, I think you are right.  But I was thinking of your mother.  She won't come.\"  \"Then you tell her that if she doesn't come I shan't be married at all,\" said Rachel.  She was betraying unsuspected ability to manage people.  She "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],["title","Kilmeny of the Orchard (#0)"],["body","OF THE ORCHARD  By L. M.

THE THOUGHTS OF YOUTH  The sunshine of a day in early spring, honey pale and honey sweet, was showering over the red brick buildings of Queenslea College and the grounds about them, throwing through the bare, budding maples and elms, delicate, evasive etchings of gold and brown on the paths, and coaxing into life the daffodils that were peering greenly and perkily up under the windows of the co-eds’ dressing-room.  A young April wind, as fresh and sweet as if it had been blowing over the fields of memory instead of through dingy streets, was purring in the tree-tops and whipping the loose tendrils of the ivy network which covered the front of the main building. It was a wind that sang of many things, but what it sang to each listener was only what was in that listener’s heart. To the college students who had just been capped and diplomad by “Old Charlie,” the grave president of Queenslea, in the presence of an admiring throng of parents and sisters, sweethearts and friends, it sang, perchance, of glad hope and shining success and high achievement. It sang of the dreams of youth that may never be quite fulfilled, but are well worth the dreaming for all that. God help the man who has never known such dreams--who, as he leaves his alma mater, is not already rich in aerial castles, the proprietor of many a spacious estate in Spain. He has missed his birthright.  The crowd streamed out of the entrance hall and scattered over the campus, fraying off into the many streets beyond. Eric Marshall and David Baker walked away together. The former had graduated in Arts that day at the head of his class; the latter had come to see the graduation, nearly bursting with pride in Eric’s success.  Between these two was an old and tried and enduring friendship, although David was ten years older than Eric, as the mere tale of years goes, and a hundred years older in knowledge of the struggles and difficulties of life which age a man far more quickly and effectually than the passing of time.  Physically the two men bore no resemblance to one another, although they were second cousins. Eric Marshall, tall, broad-shouldered, sinewy, walking with a free, easy stride, which was somehow suggestive of reserve strength and power, was one of those men regarding whom less-favoured mortals are tempted seriously to wonder why all the gifts of fortune should be showered on one individual. He was not only clever and good to look upon, but he possessed that indefinable charm of personality which is quite independent of physical beauty or mental ability. He had steady, grayish-blue eyes, dark chestnut hair with a glint of gold in its waves when the sunlight struck it, and a chin that gave the world assurance of a chin. He was a rich man’s son, with a clean young manhood behind him and splendid prospects before him. He was considered a practical sort of fellow, utterly guiltless of romantic dreams and visions of any sort.  “I am afraid Eric Marshall will never do one quixotic thing,” said a Queenslea professor, who had a habit of uttering rather mysterious epigrams, “but if he ever does it will supply the one thing lacking in him.”  David Baker was a short, stocky fellow with an ugly, irregular, charming face; his eyes were brown and keen and secretive; his mouth had a comical twist which became sarcastic, or teasing, or winning, as he willed. His voice was generally as soft and musical as a woman’s; but some few who had seen David Baker righteously angry and heard the tones which then issued from his lips were in no hurry to have the experience repeated.  He was a doctor--a specialist in troubles of the throat and voice--and he was beginning to have a national reputation. He was on the staff of the Queenslea Medical College and it was whispered that before long he would be called to fill an important vacancy at McGill.  He had won his way to success through difficulties and drawbacks which would have daunted most men. In the year Eric was born David Baker was an errand boy in the big department store of Marshall & Company. Thirteen years later he graduated with high honors from Queenslea Medical College. Mr. Marshall had given him all the help which David’s sturdy pride could be induced to accept, and now he insisted on sending the young man abroad for a post-graduate course in London and Germany. David Baker had eventually repaid every cent Mr. Marshall had expended on him; but he never ceased to cherish a passionate gratitude to the kind and generous man; and he loved that man’s son with a love surpassing that of brothers.  He had followed Eric’s college course with keen, watchful interest. It was his wish that Eric should take up the study of law or medicine now that he was through Arts; and he was greatly disappointed that Eric should have finally made up his mind to go into business with his father.  “It’s a clean waste of your talents,” he grumbled, as they walked home from the college. “You’d win fame and distinction in law--that glib tongue of yours was meant for a lawyer and it is sheer flying in the face of Providence to devote it to commercial uses--a flat crossing of the purposes of destiny. Where is your ambition, man?”  “In the right place,” answered Eric, with his ready laugh. “It is not your kind, perhaps, but there is room and need for all kinds in this lusty young country of ours. Yes, I am going into the business. In the first place, it has been father’s cherished desire ever since I was born, and it would hurt him pretty badly if I backed out now. He wished me to take an Arts course because he believed that every man should have as liberal an education as he can afford to get, but now that I have had it he wants me in the firm.”  “He wouldn’t oppose you if he thought you really wanted to go in for something else.”  “Not he. But I don’t really want to--that’s the point, David, man. You hate a business life so much yourself that you can’t get it into your blessed noddle that another man might like it. There are many lawyers in the world--too many, perhaps--but there are never too many good honest men of business, ready to do clean big things for the betterment of humanity and the upbuilding of their country, to plan great enterprises and carry them through with brain and courage, to manage and control, to aim high and strike one’s aim. There, I’m waxing eloquent, so I’d better stop. But ambition, man! Why, I’m full of it--it’s bubbling in every pore of me. I mean to make the department store of Marshall & Company famous from ocean to ocean. Father started in life as a poor boy from a Nova Scotian farm. He has built up a business that has a provincial reputation. I mean to carry it on. In five years it shall have a maritime reputation, in ten, a Canadian. I want to make the firm of Marshall & Company stand for something big in the commercial interests of Canada. Isn’t that as honourable an ambition as trying to make black seem white in a court of law, or discovering some new disease with a harrowing name to torment poor creatures who might otherwise die peacefully in blissful ignorance of what ailed them?”  “When you begin to make poor jokes it is time to stop arguing with you,”  said David, with a shrug of his fat shoulders. “Go your own gait and dree your own weird. I’d as soon expect success in trying to storm the citadel single-handed as in trying to turn you from any course about which you had once made up your mind. Whew, this street takes it out of a fellow! What could have possessed our ancestors to run a town up the side of a hill? I’m not so slim and active as I was on MY graduation day ten years ago. By the way, what a lot of co-eds were in your class--twenty, if I counted right. When I graduated there were only two ladies in our class and they were the pioneers of their sex at Queenslea. They were well past their first youth, very grim and angular and serious; and they could never have been on"]]]
