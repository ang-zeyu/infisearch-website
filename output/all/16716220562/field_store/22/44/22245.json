Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's cabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his hand. His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of meanness.  Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's character can be read upon his face.  \"That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat,\" Dan decided within himself. \"He looks like it.\"  He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.  The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the same age.  \"Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?\" asked the latter.  \"Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House,\" answered Sanderson.  \"That settles it,\" thought Dan.  He waited to hear what would come next.  \"I suppose it is meant for some young lady,\" suggested the other.  \"Maybe it is,\" answered Sanderson, with a grin.  Dan thought it was about time to come to business.  He touched the red-haired young man on the arm.  Sanderson looked round.  \"Well, boy, what is it?\" he asked.  \"You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House,\" said Dan.  \"What if I did?\" asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of what was coming.  \"You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment,\" continued Dan.  \"Do you mean to insult me?\" blustered Sanderson. \"Be off with you.\"  \"I am sorry I cannot accommodate you,\" said Dan, \"but I want you to give me a good piece for this first.\"  \"I never saw that half-dollar before,\" said Sanderson. \"I gave her good money.\"  \"Perhaps you can prove that before the court,\" said Dan.  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Sanderson, uneasily.  \"I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a good piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the pier,\" said Dan, firmly.  Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed. Soon his friend looked disgusted. Dan followed up his attack.  \"Fanny is a poor girl,\" he said. \"I found her crying over her loss, for it was more than all the money she had taken to-day.\"  \"Are you her friend?\" asked Sanderson, sneering.  \"Yes, I am,\" said Dan, stoutly.  \"This is a put-up job between you two,\" said Sanderson.  \"Gentlemen,\" said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him, \"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl. Shall he make it good?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried \"shame!\" with looks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair.  \"I don't believe a word of it,\" he ejaculated, in a rage. \"I gave the girl a quarter.\"  \"Too thin!\" said several.  \"But I'll give you the money to get rid of you,\" and he threw a half-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable.  \"Thank you, sir; here's your money,\" said Dan.  Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar, he took it and put it carefully in his pocket.  \"Keep it to pay your washerwoman with,\" said a jeering voice.  It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.  The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away from the unfriendly crowd.  \"You're a smart boy!\" cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan. \"How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the coin.\"  \"Fanny described him to me.\"  \"Then you hadn't seen him before?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"What are you doing for a living?\"  \"Selling papers, sir.\"  \"You are fit for something better. Come and see me to-morrow.\"  He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name        BARTON & ROGERS,      Commission Merchants,                No. -- Pearl street.   \"My name is Rogers,\" he continued. \"Inquire for me.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave little thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an important influence on his fortunes. He took the same boat back to New York, and hurried to the Astor House.  Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still standing in her wonted place.  \"I've got your money back, Fanny,\" said Dan.  \"Oh, have you?\" exclaimed Fanny, joyfully.  \"Yes; I made the fellow give it up.\"  \"Oh, how kind you are, Dan!\"  There was a listener to what passed between the two children. A tall lady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively. She was evidently revolving some plan in her head. As Dan was about turning away, she placed her hand on his arm.  \"Young man,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you.\"  \"All right, ma'am,\" said Dan, surprised.     CHAPTER XII.  A MYSTERIOUS LADY.   Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to send him on an errand, and his surprise vanished. She was tall, slender, and grave in appearance. She was probably not over thirty-five. Her first words renewed Dan's surprise.  \"Have you a mother living?\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"A father?\"  \"No, ma'am.\"  \"Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?\"  \"There is only one of me,\" answered Dan, humorously.  \"I suppose you are poor?\"  \"If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.\"  \"Probably you live in a poor place?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be only curiosity on the part of the lady. She noticed at once the change in his manner.  \"I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity,\" she said, quickly. \"I have an object in what I ask.\"  This naturally surprised Dan the more.  \"All right, ma'am,\" he said; \"I am ready to answer.\"  \"Are you at leisure for an hour or two?\" asked the lady.  Dan hesitated.  \"I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper,\" he said, hesitating.  \"Can't you send her a message not to expect you? Does this little girl know where you live?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Fanny, readily.  To her the lady turned.  \"Little girl,\" she said, \"go at once and tell this boy's mother that he will not be home till nine o'clock. Say he is called away by business.\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"This will pay you for your trouble.\"  The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents in her hand.  \"Thank you. How glad mother will be!\" she said.  As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of him. What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to explain his absence to his mother?  \"Now,\" said the lady, \"if you will hail the next stage we will go up town.\"  They had not long to wait. Soon they were rattling over the pavements through thronged Broadway. It was two years since Dan had been in a Broadway stage. He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but when it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.  Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage. Nearly opposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his side. Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn. Of course he did not betray any mark of recognition.  \"I like riding in a Broadway stage,\" he heard the young lady say. \"There is more to see as you go along. Besides, the company is more select.\"  \"Not always,\" said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.  Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it.  \"The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage,\" said the young lady.  \"It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.\"  \"How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?\"  \"I give it up,\" said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.  The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look.  \"Do you know that boy?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" answered Dan, \"I used to know him.\"  \"Why don't you know him now?\"  \"Because my father lost his property.\"  \"I see,\" said the lady. \"It is the way of the world. Don't mind it.\"  \"I don't,\" said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.  Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first time that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in company.  \"What can they have to do with each other?\" he asked himself, curiously. \"She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed.\"  At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief. Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a polite bow.  \"Thank you,\" said the young lady, with a pleasant smile.  \"You needn't have troubled yourself,\" said Tom Carver, irritated. \"This young lady is under _my_ charge.\"  \"It is no trouble, I assure you,\" answered Dan.  \"He is very polite,\" said the young lady, in a low voice, \"and very good-looking, too,\" she added, with a second look at Dan.  \"He is only a common newsboy,\" said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's tribute to a boy he disliked.  \"I can't help what he is,\" said the young lady, independently; \"he looks like a gentleman.\"  Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his face flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not being addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise.  \"He lives at the Five Points somewhere,\" muttered Tom.  The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only smiled in reply.  The stage kept on till it reached Madison square.  \"Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?\" said the lady, addressing Dan.  Dan did so.  He got out first, and helped his companion out.  \"Follow me into the hotel,\" she said.  Dan did so.  \"What is your name?\" asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs.  \"Dan Mordaunt.\"  \"I needn't ask if you have a good mother?\" she proceeded.  \"One of the best,\" said Dan, promptly.  \"You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady. Come into the parlor. I wish to speak to you on business.\"  Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the sofa beside her.  \"You have already told me that you have no sister,\" she began.  \"No, ma'am.\"  \"Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?\"  \"I think she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53346"],["title","The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature (#0)"],["body","was produced from scanned images of public domain material from the Google Books project.)

The biographies of that day were few and meagre; and in few cases is this so much to be regretted as in Butler’s. It would have been both interesting and profitable to trace the development and occupations of one of the mightiest of human minds. But no cotemporary gathered up the incidents of his life, and now all efforts to elicit them have been without success.  His father was a prosperous dry-goods merchant, who, at the time of his son’s birth, had retired from business with a competency, and resided in a suburban mansion called “The Priory,” still in existence.  Being a non-conformist, he educated Joseph at a “dissenting” academy at Gloucester, under SAMUEL JONES, a gentleman of great ability, and a skilful instructor, who raised up some of the greatest men of their day.[1]  It was while a member of this academy, and about the age of twenty-one, that Butler disclosed to the world his wonderful power of abstract reasoning, in his famous correspondence with Samuel Clarke, in relation to that eminent author’s “_Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God_.” This correspondence is now generally inserted at the end of that work.  Mr. Butler having deliberately adopted Episcopal views, and resolved to unite himself with the Established Church, his father, with praiseworthy liberality, sent him to Oxford, where he entered Oriel College, March, 1714. Of his college life there is no account; nor of the time and place of his ordination. He removed to London in 1718, on receiving the appointment of “Preacher at the Rolls.” His famous Fifteen Sermons were preached in that chapel, and published before resigning the place, with a dedication to Sir Joseph Jekyl, “as a parting mark of gratitude for the favors received during his connection with that learned society.”  One of Butler’s warmest college friends was Edward Talbot second son of a clergyman who afterwards became Bishop of Durham. This admirable young man died of smallpox; in his last hours recommending Butler to his father’s patronage; and scarcely had that gentleman attained the see of Durham, before he gave Mr. B. the living of Haughton, from whence he transferred him, in 1725, to the richer benefice of Stanhope.  On receiving this honorable and lucrative appointment, he resigned the Lectureship at the Rolls, and in the autumn of 1726 retired to his beautiful residence at Stanhope. Here, without a family to occupy his time, he devoted himself to his great work, the Analogy: using horseback exercise, seeing little company, living abstemiously and caring for his flock.  Seven years thus rolled away; when to draw him from what seemed to his friends too great retirement and application, Lord-Chancellor Talbot made him his chaplain, and afterwards, in 1736, gave him a prebend’s stall in Rochester. In 1736, Butler being now forty-four, Caroline, consort of George II., appointed him “Clerk of the Closet,” an office which merely required his attendance at the Queen’s apartments every evening, from seven to nine.  Being now in London, convenient to the press, and enjoying both leisure and competency, he published his immortal ANALOGY--the cherished work of his life. The Queen was delighted with the book, and made herself master of its glorious array of reasoning. But she died the same year, and he lost not only a patroness, but a friend. He returned to his benefice at Stanhope, the income of which had been held during his residence in London.  On her death-bed, the Queen had urged her husband to promote her honored chaplain to a bishopric; and next year, the see of Norwich becoming vacant, the Bishop of Bristol was translated to it, and the see of Bristol given to Butler. Bristol was the poorest bishopric in England, its emoluments being but $2,000 per annum; less than those of the rectorship of Stanhope. Butler distinctly disclosed his disappointment in his letter to the minister Walpole, accepting the position; and declared that he did not think it “very suitable to the condition of his fortune, nor answerable to the recommendation with which he was honored.” The king was not displeased at this candor, and in 1740 improved his income by giving him, in addition to his bishopric, the profitable and influential office of Dean of St. Paul’s. Butler, who had retained the living of Stanhope along with his bishopric, now resigned that rectorship. “The rich revenues,” says Professor Fitzgerald, “of the Deanery of St. Paul, enabled him to gratify his taste at Bristol.” He expended about $25,000 in improving and beautifying the episcopal residence and gardens. He fostered useful charities, and employed his wealth for others rather than for himself.  In 1750, upon the death of Dr. Edward Chandler, Bishop of Durham, Butler was promoted to that see, the most honorable and lucrative in England. He had before been offered the Primacy, on the death of Archbishop Potter, but declined it, with the remark that “it was too late for him to try to support a falling church.” On assuming his diocese at Durham, Butler delivered and published his famous Charge to the Clergy, upon “The Use and Importance of External Religion.” He was at once assailed vigorously, in pamphlets and papers, by Archdeacon Blackburn, the Rev. T. Lindsay, and others, on the charge of Popery; an imputation which is still sometimes cast upon him, and which finds some slender support in his setting up a marble cross over the communion-table at Bristol."]]]
