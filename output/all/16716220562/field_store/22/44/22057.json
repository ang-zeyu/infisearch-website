But we will not sermonize; even at this distance we may hold out the strong arm of influence, assuring our readers that the highest aims of writers and publishers are for the advancement of the younger girls, whose minds, for the moment, are entrusted to our keeping.  Coming back to our group of Girl Scouts, now holding conclave in the school yard of Flosston grammar grades, we find Grace and Madeline forming themselves into a committee of two, with the avowed intention of getting lip a hiking party for their own special benefit. These younger girls must soon undergo the test necessary for their qualification as second class scouts, and a hike on this lovely spring afternoon would aid them greatly in acquiring the outdoor knowledge necessary.  Margaret was rather inclined to dissent when the jaunt was proposed, she did not feel quite as hiky as usual, and she promptly remembered she had promised her mother some assistance in the little kitchen garden both were developing.  \"Oh, come on,\" pleaded Grace. \"If you say you want to go, I am sure Captain Clark will agree. I know where we can get the loveliest watercress.\"  This lure won Margaret, who had now fully recovered her scout cheer, and was trying bravely to forget the loss of her cherished badge\".  \"Mother loves watercress,\" she conceded, \"and I would go, if we are sure to be back by five. I have to go call for the mail before dark.\"  \"Oh, goody-good!\" sang out Grace. \"Now I can surely get my nature work all nicely covered. I'll tell Madaline. She is over there coaxing Cleo,\" and with a risky flourish of her red tie, a hop, skip and a jump, the Tenderfoot pranced across the big green schoolyard, in a fashion that belied her limitations on the tenderfoot basis.  \"Yes, I'll go,\" Cleo was agreeing, \"but I am afraid we can't get Captain Clark. I know she is going out to Kingsley to form a troop. Maybe we can get Lieutenant Lindsley. She is free from Normal at four. They have a lecture after two-thirty almost every day.\"  \"Oh, Lieutenant Lindsley would be lots of fun. She knows everything in hill and dale, and is not afraid of snakes or cows. But do you think we should notify the other girls? It is rather hard to get in touch with them in time,\" Grace ranted on.  By this time Margaret and Madaline had joined the group, and now all the scouts in seventh and eighth grammar grades were discussing plans for the precipitous hike. There were Mable Blake, also a tenderfoot, Adaline Allen and Mildred Clark, second grades, and the McKay twins, first class scouts. All of these willingly agreed to make the foot trip out to the Falls.  The afternoon school session received scant attention from the prospective hikers, the Tenderfoots especially being absorbed in the prospects of a spring afternoon in the woods.  So interested were Grace and Madaline they exchanged preparatory notes in the five minute rest period, although that time was set aside for real relaxation, and no one was supposed to use eyes or fingers during the short rest.  When school was finally dismissed the girls arranged to pass the homes of most of the group, as many of them lived on the same Oakley Avenue, and thus notify parents of their scout plans for the hike, and when Lieutenant Lindsley was eventually picked up from the practicing department of the Normal School, the ranks were filled, and the hike moved off towards the River Road.  It was a glorious afternoon, in late April. The peach blossoms were just breaking into pink puff balls, and the pear trees were burdened with a crop of spring \"snow,\" fragrant in their whitest of dainty blossoms.  But the still life beauties were not more attractive than the joyous, happy, romping girls, who capered along from the more noisy town streets, into the highways and byways of the long green stretch of country leading to the river brink, and to the woods on its border.  \"I'm going to do something really great,\" declared Grace. \"I don't care just what it is, but I want to have a real record, when I am called up to take my degree test. I am not afraid of anything in daylight, so beware! I may do something very desperate and rash this afternoon.\"  \"Spare us,\" pleaded Madaline. \"I have seen some of our courage worked out in the woods before. Remember the time you nearly set fire to the river? Well, don't, please, go try anything like that today.\"  \"No, it must be something for which I should receive a badge of courage, if I were in the first class. I want to blush with fitting modesty when Captain Clark invests me with the next degree, and I shall only blush when reminded of my noble deed this afternoon.\"  \"Since you are not particular about what deed shall be the noble one, won't you just give me a hand, and help me save this heel of mine from a blistering shoe? The shoe was all right in school, but just now it has picked up a snag, somehow, and between the shoe and the snag, my life is not worth living.\"  \"Poor Madie,\" soothed her chum. \"Let us sit right down here and diagnose the case. I'm first rate at diagnosing anything but why my bureau can't stay fixed. It has chronic upsettedness, and all my operations are of no avail. There go the girls down into the hazel nut gully. Let's sit on this lovely mossy couch, and look after the heel. Doesn't moss grow beautifully smooth under the cedars? I wonder how it ever gets so velvety?\"  At the twined and natural woven seat, wrought from the uncovered roots of a great hemlock, the girls caressed and patted the velvet moss that formed a veritable carpet--no--it was softer than carpet, a silken velvet throw, over a natural cedar divan. Even the suffering heel was forgotten, in the joy of nature study, in green, with the darker green canopy of cedars, and the music of a running river at the foot of the sloping hill. Here the scent of watercress vied with the hemlock and cedar, for its place as nature's perfume, and only such mingling of wild ferns, trailing arbutus, budding bush, and leafing vine, could produce the aroma of incense that just then permeated the woody glen.  \"Don't let the girls get too far away from us,\" cautioned Madeline. \"I wouldn't like to get really lost, even for the joke of having you find me, Gracie.\"  \"But you would do a little thing like that to help me out on my personal bravery stunt?\" teased her companion. \"I wonder why only the first class girls are permitted to do all those wonderful things and get all the really high honors?\"  \"Because they have gone through all the necessary trials and examinations,\" replied Madaline sagely. \"You and I can get credit for our deeds, but we must show our full records to get the highest B. C. That's fair. You can't make a major out of a private. He has got to go up by degrees.\"  \"Well, maybe it is fair, but I just love the glory of presentations. I am so sorry for Margaret. I would have dug up the town today to find that Merit Badge she lost last night.\"  \"I like the way she braved it out, though,\" added Madaline. \"She felt badly enough, and it did mean so much to her,\" finished the sympathetic scout.  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so,\" rather reluctantly agreed the ambitious Grace. \"But I shouldn't relish the feeling that some grimy mill girl was wearing the badge in a smoky factory.\"  \"Oh, Grace, shame! That's not scouty. You must not speak so of the mill girls. We hope to take some of them in our troop before long. We would have no right to public support if we did not do something definite for others, and the mill girls have so few chances. So don't, Gracie dear, ever speak like that again.\"  \"I won't if you say so, also if it isn't scouty. I am out to win the goal, and I don't mind what I may have to do to get my scout good conduct ball into the official basket. Now, how's the heel? Did the little pad of soft leaves help to keep the pressure off?\"  \"Yes, that was a fine idea, and I shall see to it that some day, when original work is called for, you get credit for the nature-aid heel pad. Rather a clumsy title, but when we explain how easy it is to get soft leaves to make pads for suffering feet, I am sure it will be welcome news to many an ambitious hiker.\"  \"Oh, Madie dear,\" suddenly exclaimed Grace. \"Where are the girls gone? They are not in the hazel nut clump, and I can't hear a sound!\"  \"Oh, my! Suppose they have gone looking for us the other way?\"  Both girls in alarm, now scurried through the woods, calling and giving the \"Coo-ee\" call, but not a sound answered them. Birds were flitting about from limb to branch, and the strange stillness of the woods frightened the little Tenderfoots.  \"You go along the bank, and I'll scour the elderberry patch. This wood is so dense in spots, and so clear under the hemlocks, it is easy to lose and hard to find anyone in it,\" declared Grace. \"I'm glad I brought my big rope. I intended to tie every knot in the course, and cut them all out to fetch back finished, and I haven't even unwound the rope.\"  \"If there is anything easier than getting lost in the woods it must be getting caught at whispering in the eighth grade,\" grumbled Madaline. \"I wish my old heel had behaved itself.\"  \"And all the plans for my brave stunt gone to naught,\" put in the now breathless Grace. \"I would never have made up the hike if I had not determined to get a glory mark out of it. Now see where we are! Miles from home, and darkness coming on at each end. Where could those girls have gone to?\"  \"Sure as shooting they have gone on searching for us. There's the reservoir road, going in the opposite direction, and also Chestnut Hill. To go either of those roads meant getting entirely away from the foolish little scouts who stopped to chatter and chin. Just shows what we can do when we don't know we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5263"],["title","The Girl Scout Pioneers; Or, Winning the First B. C. (#3)"],["body","uldn't.\"  For some moments they brushed their way through the thicket, beating down briars with their stout sticks, then coming to a broad clearance they found themselves in a great grove of pines, clean as a floor, except for the layer of savory pine needles, and almost dark as night from the density of the pine canopies.  \"My, how lovely!\" exclaimed Grace.  \"Yes, if we could only enjoy it,\" demurred Madaline.  \"Grace! What's that? Over under that thick tree!\"  \"A man! Let's run!\"  \"And there is a big bag beside him,\" whispered Grace. \"See the things sticking out of it!\"  \"No, I don't want to see anything. Run, I tell you!\"  \"Wait! Maybe I could make this my bravery act. Suppose I tie him with my strong rope?\"  \"Grace Philow! Are you crazy?\" and the more frightened girl attempted to drag the other away. \"Please--don't speak loud. If he wakes I shall die.\"  \"No, don't you dare! Just keep still. I am going to see if I can tie up one town tramp. There are plenty loose, and this is my golden opportunity!\"     CHAPTER III  A NOBLE DEED UNDONE   \"Now Grace! If you attempt to go near that dreadful man I shall scream and wake him up,\" threatened Madaline, in real alarm.  \"No, you won't either. You would be afraid to. Hush, keep still. I want to see if I can lasso his old bag. Wouldn't it be fine if I could rescue Mrs. Johnston's washing? You know it was stolen off her line two nights ago.\" With this the daring girl stole up more closely to the sleeping figure.  The quiet lull of the flowing river, as it fell over a little cascade, was acting as a potential lullaby to the wayfarer at the foot of the tree. His figure was grotesque, but at the distance the girls were viewing him from it was not possible to discern more than a figure--it might be that of almost any sort of a man, for all they could tell.  Grace untied her nice clean coil of rope, while Madaline besought her in every kind of cabalistic sign she could summon to her aid, to desist in her reckless intention of tieing the man to the tree. But the temptation was evidently too much for the frolicsome Grace, for as Madaline cast a wild eye over her shoulder in her flight from the spot, she could just see Grace, tip-toeing up to that figure.  A few seconds later came a stifled cry!  \"Wait, oh, Madie, wait!\" called Grace, and, stopping in the briar path, Madaline glimpsed the imperturbable Grace, making her way through the thicket and dragging something heavy behind her!  \"Mercy me!\"' exclaimed Madaline. \"What can she be tugging along!\"  \"Wait, help me!\" now called Grace in a bolder voice.  \"No, I will not! Grace Philow, are you crazy?\" gasped Madaline.  \"Crazy, not at all,\" sang out Grace in a laughing voice. \"I've got it!\"  \"Got what?\" Madaline cried anxiously.  \"Mrs. Johnston's wash!\"  \"Oh, Grace, you will get us both arrested.\"  \"For recovering stolen property! You have a fine sense of scout laws,\" Grace retorted. \"If you don't help me get out of the briars I shall report you to the captain--if we ever find her,\" and another laugh grated on the frightened ears of Madaline.  \"I can't help you, Grace,\" Madaline replied in a more conciliatory tone. \"The briars are so thick here, they almost tore off my shoe--it is not laced tight, you know.\"  \"Well, they are tearing up Mrs. Johnston's wash,\" admitted Grace, still tagging at the trailing bag, that could not be seen in the thicket and brambles she dragged it over.  \"Oh, Grace! There he comes!\" screamed Madaline, as a moving figure could be outlined in the shadows of the low brush, and tall swamp berry trees, that just towered high enough to hide the form that bent and broke the impeding young birches. It was the swish and motion of the brush that indicated his advance and location.  \"Mercy!\" yelled Grace, alarmed now in spite of her boasted courage. \"Let's run. But I won't drop this wash. I don't care if he follows me into the post-office for it,\" and at that, she gave the rope one more terrific jerk, the force of which brought the trailing obstacle out into the path where it had a clear track to follow the girl, who held madly to the other end of the rope.  No words were wasted as the girls scampered and scurried through that wood. Grace held firmly to the rope, and could feel that it still dragged her quarry, while Madaline never turned her head to see whether or not the pursuing man was at their heels. That they had not been struck down was enough, to be thankful for, thought Madaline.  And in all of this, no trace of the other members of the hiking party was discovered. More than once the girls heard something they decided ought to be their \"Coo-ee\" call, but each time it turned out to be nothing more friendly than the astonished birds, either laughing at the scouts, or rooting for their successful escape from the pursuer.  Beaching the big rock that covered the path, and always had to be climbed over \"by hand,\" the girls scrambled up, then down, and when Grace gave a necessarily vigorous tug at her rope it sprang up to her face in a real caress! In fact it actually coiled around her like a friendly thing.  Mrs. Johnston's wash was gone!  \"Oh, he grabbed it!\" wailed Grace. \"He got hold of my rope when we had to stop to make the rock and now--he has got it again!\"  \"Don't you dare stop one minute!\" panted Madaline. \"You have almost murdered us as it is,\" she proclaimed in her excitement, which always banished her ordinarily sparse supply of reasonable language.  \"Nice way you help a sister,\" mocked Grace. \"I thought you were going to help me win honors,\" and she gathered up her delinquent rope with a much disturbed expression on her pretty face.  \"I think I have helped you save your life, if you only knew it,\" Madaline managed to articulate. \"The idea--\"  \"All the same I did tie him up,\" admitted Grace, bolder now that she could see the end of the woods. \"I don't see how he got loose. I used the running bow-line, and a couple of clove hitches. Our old knots came in useful, but they didn't hold evidently. Hark! Wasn't that a whistle! Sounded like Margaret's trill.\"  \"Yes, and it's away over on the Avenue. Whatever will Captain Clark say?\"  \"Now, Madie, you just promise you will say nothing about my man and Mrs. Johnston's wash. I tried to do something noble and it didn't pan out, so if you are a good little pal, and a first rate sport, you will keep mam as a clam, won't you, please, Madie?\"  \"Well, since it did not end in a tragedy I suppose I may keep quiet without breaking honor, but you know, Gracie, I am six months older than you, and I would be held accountable at a trial.\"  \"Don't you fret,\" and Grace was now shaking her curly head and throwing her blazing cheeks up to the clearance light, with, renewed defiance. \"I certainly had a lovely time while it lasted.\"  \"There are the girls!\" exclaimed Madaline joyously. \"It would have been dreadful if they were obliged to go all the way into Flosston without us. They would have come back with the mill bell man looking for us.\"  \"Whoo-hoo!! Coo-ee, Coo-ee!!\" trilled Grace, and back came the welcome answer.  \"Coo-ee! Coo-ee! Whoo-hoo!\"  Realizing the lost was found, Lieutenant Lindsley stood on top of the little hill, just over the turn of the macadam road, that outlined Oakley Avenue, the one street of distinction that ran through the country and gave tone to little Flosston on its way. She was an attractive figure standing there in her plain serge suit, and soft tam-o'-shanter on her finely poised head, and even at a distance one would be correct in describing Romaine Lindsley as an attractive, fine-looking young girl.  Around her were the other members of the hiking party, all of whom had come to an abrupt halt, at the call of Grace and Madaline from the woodlands.  \"Don't run to meet them,\" cautioned the lieutenant, \"that might mean another mixup,\" and she gave a double quick trill to notify the delinquents they were expected to report promptly. \"After all there appears to be no harm done, other than the loss of an afternoon's sport.\"  \"But I did not get my watercress,\" wailed Winnie, the blonde of the McKay twins.  \"And I lost a perfectly good side comb mother just received from Philadelphia,\" complained Cleo. \"I wanted this kind and could not get them around here. Now one is lost and the other useless.\"  \"But we must not complain, Cleo,\" admonished the lieutenant pleasantly. \"It isn't good scouting, you know.\"  By this time the runaways, or lost sheep, had caught up with the awaiting contingent. That they would be deluged with questions, and all but stampeded for answers, was to be expected.  \"It was an accident,\" Grace managed to inject finally. \"Madie's foot went blistered--and I hunted around for some--some medicated leaves,\" this was said in an apologetic tone, \"and when the heel was all fixed we were thoroughly lost.\"  Madaline sighed and smiled alternately, and agreed without venturing to say so.  \"Well, we are glad you met with no mishap,\" declared the lieutenant, to whom girls lost in the woods was not a new adventure. \"We were going back for you just now. The trouble was we took the left road to look for you, when, of course, you were hugging due right. Didn't you see our trail?\"  \"Yes, after we struck it,\" responded spokes-man Grace. \"We were so deep in the cedar grove we had no chance to strike trails. Oh, girls, you should see the wonderful picnic grounds we discovered!\" she enthused, with the very evident intention of getting Madaline's mind off the man and the bag of wash. \"It is a perfect little park, all carpeted with pine needles, and canopied with the loveliest trees--\"  \"All right, Grace,\" cut in the lieutenant. \"But come along. We must be making tracks. No time just now for a panoramic view. We will certainly have to take this hike all over again to compensate the girls for their disappointment. However, no doubt we have learned something.\"  \"You bet,\" Grace whispered to Madaline, as she fell into step for the homeward march. \"I learned"]]]
