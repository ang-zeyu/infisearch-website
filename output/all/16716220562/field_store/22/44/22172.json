Where's my pretty cousin?\"  Mr. Baron had opened his mouth to speak several times during this characteristic greeting, and now he hastened to the foot of the stairs and shouted, \"Louise, come down and help your aunt entertain our guests.\" Meanwhile Whately stepped to the sideboard and helped himself liberally to the sherry.  \"You know me must maintain discipline,\" resumed Whately, as his uncle entered the dining-room. \"The night is mild and still. Let a long table be set on the piazza for my men. I can then pledge them through the open window, for since I give them such hard service, I must make amends when I can. Ah, Perkins, have your people rub the horses till they are ready to prance, then feed them lightly, two hours later a heavier feed, that's a good fellow! You were born under a lucky star, uncle. You might now be tied up by your thumbs, while the Yanks helped themselves.\"  \"It surely was a kind Providence which brought you here, nephew.\"  \"No doubt, no doubt; my good horse, also, and, I may add, the wish to see my pretty cousin. Ah! here she comes with the blushes of the morning on her cheeks,\" but his warmer than a cousinly embrace and kiss left the crimson of anger in their places.  She drew herself up indignantly to her full height and said, \"We have been discussing the fact that I am quite grown up. I will thank you to note the change, also.\"  \"Why, so I do,\" he replied, regarding her with undisguised admiration; \"and old Father Time has touched you only to improve you in every respect.\"  \"Very well, then,\" she replied, coldly, \"I cannot help the touch of Father Time, but I wish it understood that I am no longer a child.\"  \"Neither am I, sweet cousin, and I like you as a woman far better.\"  She left the room abruptly to assist her aunt.  \"Jove! uncle, but she has grown to be a beauty. How these girls blossom out when their time comes! Can it be that I have been absent a year?\"  \"Yes, and your last visit was but a flying one.\"  \"And so I fear this one must be. The Yanks are on the move, perhaps in this direction, and so are we. It was one of their scouting parties that we ran into. Their horses were fresher than ours and they separated when once in the shadow of the woods. They won't be slow, however, in leaving these parts, now they know we are here. I'm going to take a little well-earned rest between my scoutings, and make love to my cousin. Olympian humbugs! how handsome and haughty she has become! I didn't think the little minx had so much spirit.\"  \"She has suddenly taken the notion that, since she is growing up, she can snap her fingers at all the powers that be.\"  \"Growing up! Why, uncle, she's grown, and ready to hear me say, 'With all my worldly goods I thee endow.'\"  \"But the trouble is, she doesn't act as if very ready.\"  \"Oh, tush! she isn't ready to throw herself at the head of any one. That isn't the way of Southern girls. They want a wooer like a cyclone, who carries them by storm, marries them nolens volens, and then they're happy. But to be serious, uncle, in these stormy times Lou needs a protector. You've escaped for a long time, but no one can tell now what a day will bring forth. As my wife, Cousin Lou will command more respect. I can take her within our lines, if necessary, or send her to a place of safety. Ah, here comes my blooming aunt to prepare for supper.\"  \"Welcome to The Oaks,\" she again repeated. \"Never more welcome, since you come as defender as well as guest.\"  \"Yes, aunt; think of a red-whiskered Yank paying his respects instead of me.\"  \"Don't suggest such horrors, please.\"  The gentlemen now joined Miss Lou in the parlor, while under Mrs. Baron's supervision Zany, and Chunk, as gardener and man-of-all-work, with the aid of others soon set the two tables. Then began a procession of negroes of all sizes bearing viands from the kitchen.     CHAPTER IV  AUN' JINKEY'S POLICY   Allan Scoville, for such was the Union soldier's name, fully realized that he was in the enemy's country as he watched through a cranny in the cabin the shadowy forms of the Confederates file past. Every bone in his body ached as if it had been broken, and more than once he moved his arms and legs to assure himself that they were whole. \"Breath was just knocked right out of me,\" he muttered. \"I hope that's the worst, for this place may soon become too hot for me. My good horse is not only lost, but I may be lost also through him. That queer-looking darky, Chunk, is my best hope now unless it is Miss Lou. Droll, wasn't it, that I should take her for an angel? What queer thoughts a fellow has when within half an inch of the seamy side of life! Hanged if I deserve such an awakening as I thought was blessing my eyes on the other side. From the way I ache, the other side mayn't be far off yet. Like enough hours will pass before Chunk comes back, and I must try to propitiate his grandam.\"  He crawled painfully to the trap-door and, finding a chink in the boards, looked down into the apartment below. Aun' Jinkey was smoking as composedly it might seem as if a terrible Yankee, never seen before, was not over her head, and a band of Confederates who would have made him a prisoner and punished her were only a few rods away. A close observer, however, might have noticed that she was not enjoying languid whiffs, as had been the case in the afternoon. The old woman had put guile into her pipe as well as tobacco, and she hoped its smoke would blind suspicious eyes if any were hunting for a stray Yankee. Chunk's pone and bacon had been put near the fire to keep warm, and Scoville looked at the viands longingly.  At last he ventured to whisper, \"Aun' Jinkey, I am as hungry as a wolf.\"  \"Hesh!\" said the old woman softly. Then she rose, knocked the ashes from her pipe with great deliberation, and taking a bucket started for the spring. In going and coming she looked very sharply in all directions, thus satisfying herself that no one was watching the cabin. Re-entering, she whispered, \"Kin you lif de trap-do'?\"  Scoville opened it, and was about to descend. \"No, you kyant do dat,\" interposed Aun' Jinkey, quickly. \"Lie down up dar, en I han' you Chunk's supper. He gits his'n at de big house. You's got ter play possum right smart, mars'r, or you git cotched. Den we cotch it, too. You 'speck I doan know de resk Chunk en me tookin?\"  \"Forgive me, Aunt Jinkey. But your troubles will soon be over and you be as free as I am.\"  \"I doesn't want no sech freedom ez you got, mars'r, hid'n en scrugin' fum tarin' en rarin' red-hot gallopers ez Mad Whately en his men. Dey'd des bun de ole cabin en me in't ef dey knowed you's dar. Bettah stop yo' mouf wid yo' supper.\"  This Scoville was well contented to do for a time, while Aun' Jinkey smoked and listened with all her ears. Faint sounds came from the house and the negro quarters, but all was still about the cabin. Suddenly she took her pipe from her mouth and muttered, \"Dar goes a squinch-owl tootin'. Dat doan mean no good.\"  \"Aunt Jinkey,\" said Scoville, who was watching her, \"that screech-owl worries you, doesn't it?\"  \"Dere's mo' kin's ob squinch-owls dan you 'lows on, mars'r. Some toots fer de sake ob tootin' en some toots in warnin'.\"  \"That one tooted in warning. Don't be surprised if you hear another very near.\" He crawled to the cranny under the eaves and Aun' Jinkey fairly jumped out of her chair as she heard an owl apparently hooting on the roof with a vigor and truth to nature that utterly deceived her senses. Scoville repeated the signal, and then crept back to the chink in the floor. The old woman was trembling and looking round in dismayed uncertainty. \"There,\" he said, with a low laugh, \"that squinch-owl was I, and the first you heard was one of my men. Now, like a good soul, make pones and fry bacon for five men, and you'll have friends who will take good care of you and Chunk.\"  \"De Lawd he'p me! w'at comin' nex'? Miss Lou wuz a wishin' sump'n ud hap'n--w'at ain' gwinter hap'n?\"  \"Nothing will happen to harm you if you do as I say. Our men may soon be marching this way, and we'll remember our friends when we come.\"  \"I des hope dere'll be sump'n lef ob me ter reckermember,\" said Aun' Jinkey, but she rose to comply with the soldier's requirement, feeling that her only course was to fall in with the wishes of whoever happened to be uppermost in the troublous times now foreseen. She was in a terribly divided state of mind. The questions she had smoked and thought over so long now pressed with bewildering rapidity and urgency. An old family slave, she had a strong feeling of loyalty to her master and mistress. But they had been partially alienating Miss Lou, for whom she would open her veins, while her grandson was hot for freedom and looked upon Northern soldiers as his deliverers. Aun' Jinkey was not sure she wished to be delivered. That was one of the points she was not through \"projeckin'\" about. Alas! events would not wait for her conclusions, although more time had been given her than to many others forced to contemplate vast changes. With a shrewd simplicity she decided that it would be wise to keep on friendly terms with all the contending powers, and do what in her judgment was best for each.  \"Hit des took all de 'visions we got,\" she remarked, disconsolately.  \"You'll soon have visions of more to eat and wear than ever blessed your eyes,\" said Scoville, encouragingly.  \"Hi! granny,\" said Chunk, peeping in at the door.  \"How you start me!\" ejaculated the old woman, sinking into her chair.  \"That you, Chunk?\" asked Scoville. \"Is the coast clear?\"  \"I reck'n. Keep shy yet a while, mars'r.\" A few words explained the situation, and Chunk added: \"You des feed dem Yankees big, granny. I'se pervide mo'. I mus' go now sud'n. Made Aun' Suke b'lebe dat I knowed ob chickens w'at roos' in trees, en dey tinks I'se lookin' fer um. High ole times up ter de house,\" and he disappeared in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5309"],["title","\"Miss Lou\" (#5)"],["body","darkness.  In nervous haste Aun' Jinkey prepared the ample supper. Scoville hooted again, a shadowy form stole to the cabin for the food, and disappeared again toward the run. Then Aun' Jinkey prepared to compose her nerves by another smoke.  \"Hand me up a coal for my pipe, also,\" said Scoville, \"and then we'll have a sociable time.\"  \"I des feared onsosh'ble times dis eb'nin',\" remarked Aun' Jinkey.  \"If you knew how my bones ached, you'd help me pass the time.\"  \"Reck'n mine ache, too, 'fo' I troo wid dis bus'ness.\"  \"No, Aunt Jinkey, you won't be punished for doing a good deed. Your young mistress is on your side, anyway. Who is she?\"  \"Young mistis ain' got no po'r ef dey fin's out. She nuff ter do ter hol' 'er own.\"  \"How comes it she's friendly to 'we uns,' as you say down here?\"  \"She ain' friendly. You drap at her feet ez ef you wuz dead, en she hab a lil gyurlish, soft heart, dat's all. Didn't she tole you dat she ain' on yo' side?\"  \"Well, bless her heart, then.\"  \"I circumscribe ter dat ar.\"  \"Aren't you on our side?\"  \"I'se des 'twix en 'tween all de sides.\"  \"You're all right, Aunt Jinkey. I'd trust you with my life.\"  \"Reck'n you hab ter dis eb'nin'.\"  \"Well, about Miss Lou--you say she has trouble to hold her own. How's that?\"  \"Dem's fambly matters.\"  \"And so none of my business, unless she tells me herself.\"  \"How she gwine ter tol' you tings?\"  \"Ah, Aunt Jinkey, you've vegetated a great while in these slow parts. I feel it in my bones, sore as they are, that some day I'll give you a new dress that will make you look like a spike of red hollyhocks. You'll see changes you don't dream of.\"  \"My haid whirlin' now, mars'r. Hope ter grashus I kin do my wuk ter-morrer in peace and quietness.\"  There was neither peace nor quietness at the mansion. Whately, with a soldier's instincts to make the most of passing opportunities, added to the hasty tendencies of his own nature, was not only enjoying the abundant supper, but feasting his eyes meantime on the charms developed by his cousin in his absence. He knew of his uncle's wish to unite the two plantations, and had given his assent to the means, for it had always been his delight to tease, frighten, and pet his little cousin, whose promise of beauty had been all that he could desire. Now she evoked a sudden flame of passion, and his mind, which leaped to conclusions, was already engaged in plans for consummating their union at once. He sought to break down her reserve by paying her extravagant compliments, and to excite her admiration by accounts of battles in which he would not have posed as hero so plainly had he not been flushed with wine. There was an ominous fire in her eyes scarcely in accord with her cool demeanor. Unused to the world, and distrusting her own powers, she made little effort to reply, taking refuge in comparative silence. This course encouraged him and her uncle. The former liked her manifestation of spirit as long as he believed it to be within control. To his impetuous, imperious nature the idea of a tame, insipid bride was not agreeable; while Mr. Baron, still under the illusion that she was yet but a submissive child, thought that her bad mood was passing and would be gone in the morning. He little dreamed how swiftly her mind was awakening and developing under the spur of events. She did not yet know that her cousin was meditating such a speedy consummation of his purpose, but was aware that he and all her relatives looked upon her as his predestined wife. Now, as never before, she shrank from the relation, and in the instinct of self-preservation resolved never to enter into it.  Her long, rebellious reveries in solitude had prepared her for this hour, and her proud, excited spirit surprised her by the intensity of its passionate revolt. Not as a timid, shrinking maiden did she look at her cousin and his men feasting on the piazza. She glanced at him, then through the open windows at their burly forms, as one might face a menace which brought no thought of yielding.  The family resemblance between Whately and herself was strong. He had her blue eyes, but they were smaller than hers, and his expression was bold, verging toward recklessness. Her look was steady and her lips compressed into accord with the firm little chin.  Mrs. Baron's ideas of decorum soon brought temporary relief. She also saw that her nephew was becoming too excited to make a good impression, so she said, \"Louise, you may now retire, and I trust that you will waken tomorrow to the truth that your natural guardians can best direct your thoughts and actions.\"  Whately was about to rise in order to bid an affectionate good-night, but the girl almost fled from the room. In the hall she met Chunk, who whispered, \"Linkum man gittin' peart, Miss Lou.\"  \"She'll be over her tantrum by morning,\" said Mr. Baron in an apologetic tone. \"Perhaps we'll have to humor her more in little things.\"  \"That's just where the trouble lies, uncle. You and aunt have tried to make her feel and act as if as old as yourselves. She's no longer a child; neither is she exactly a woman. All young creatures at her age are skittish. Bless you, she wouldn't be a Baron if she hadn't lots of red, warm blood. So much the better. When I've married her she'll settle down like other Southern girls.\"  \"I think we had better discuss these matters more privately, nephew,\" said Mrs. Baron.  \"Beg pardon, I reckon we had, aunt. My advice, however, is that we act first and discuss afterward.\"  \"We'll talk it over to-morrow, nephew,\" said Mr. Baron. \"Of course as guardian I must adopt the best and safest plan.\"  Chunk's ears were long if he was short, and in waiting on a soldier near the window he caught the purport of this conversation.     CHAPTER V  WHATELY'S IDEA OF COURTSHIP   When waiting on the table, Zany either stood like an image carved out of black walnut or moved with the angular promptness of an automaton when a spring is touched. Only the quick roll of her eyes indicated how observant she was. If, however, she met Chunk in the hall, or anywhere away from observation, she never lost the opportunity to torment him. A queer grimace, a surprised stare, an exasperating derisive giggle, were her only acknowledgments of his amorous attentions. \"Ef I doesn't git eben wid dat niggah, den I eat a mule,\" he muttered more than once.  But Chunk was in great spirits and a state of suppressed excitement. \"'Pears ez ef I mout own mysef 'fo' dis moon done waxin' en wanin',\" he thought. \"Dere's big times comin,' big times. I'se yeard w'at hap'n w'en de Yanks go troo de kentry like an ol bull in a crock'ry sto'.\" In his duties of waiting on the troopers and clearing the table he had opportunities of purloining a goodly portion of the viands, for he remembered that he also had assumed the role of host with a very meagre larder to draw upon.  Since the Confederates were greatly wearied and were doubly inclined to sleep from the effects of a hearty supper and liberal potations, Mr. Baron offered to maintain a watch the early part of the night, while Perkins was enjoined to sleep with one eye open near the quarters. Mattresses and quilts were brought down and spread on the piazza floor, from which soon rose a nasal chorus, \"des like,\" as Chunk declared, \"a frog-pon' in full blas'.\"  Whately, trained in alert, soldierly ways, slept on the sofa in the parlor near his men. One after another the lights were extinguished, and the house became quiet. Chunk was stealing away with his plunder through the shrubbery in the rear of the house, when he was suddenly confronted by Zany. \"Hi! you niggah!\" she whispered, \"I'se cotch you now kyarin' off nuff vittles ter keep you a mont. You gwinter run away.\"  \"You wan ter run wid me?\" asked Chunk, unabashed.  \"What you took me fer?\"  \"Fer better er wuss, w'ite folks say. Reck'n it ud be fer wuss in dis case.\"  \"I reck'n de wuss ain' fur off. I des step ter ole mars'r an' tell 'im ter 'vestigate yo' cabin dis eb'nin',\" she said, and, with a great show of offended dignity, she was about to move away.  \"Look yere, Zany, doan yer be a fool. Doan you wanter be a free gyurl?\"  \"Ef you had me fer wuss I'd be des 'bout ez free ez Miss Lou w'en she mar'ed ter Mad Whately.\"  \"Hi! you year dat, too?\"  \"I got eyes, en I got years, en you ain' gwinter light out dis night en lebe yo' granny en we uns. I sut'ny put a spoke in yo' wheel dat stop hits runnin'.\"  Chunk was now convinced that he would have to take Zany into his confidence. He looked cautiously around, then whispered rapidly in her ear. \"Hi!\" she exclaimed, softly, \"you got longer head dan body.\"  \"I kin reach ter yo' lips,\" said Chunk, snatching a kiss.  \"Stop dat foolishness!\" she exclaimed, giving him a slight cuff.  \"Zany, keep mum ez a possum. Dere's big times comin', en no un kin hender um, dough dey kin git deysefs in a heap ob trouble by blarnations. De Linkum men soon gwine ter be top of de heap an I'se gwinter be on top wid um. Dar you be, too, ef you stan's by Miss Lou en me.\"  \"Ve'y well, but I'se gwinter keep my eye on you, Marse Chunk.\"  \"Reck'n you will, kaze I am' gwinter be fur off; en ef you puts yo' eye on some oder man, you soon fin' he ain' dar.\" With this ominous assurance he stole away.  Soon afterward the hoot of an owl was heard again; shadows approached the cabin; Scoville, assisted by Chunk, joined them, and there was a whispered consultation. Scoville put the result in the following words:  \"The chance is a good one, I admit. It is quite possible that we could capture the Johnnies and their horses, but that's not what we're out for. Besides, I'm too badly broken up. I couldn't ride to-night. You must go back to camp, and leave me to follow. Chunk here has provisions for you. Better be moving, for Whately will probably be out looking for you in the morning.\"  So it was decided, and the shadows disappeared. Scoville was put into Aun' Jinkey's bed, the old woman saying that she would sit up and watch."]]]
