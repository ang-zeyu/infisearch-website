Mrs. Abner shook her curls in a way that made people overwhelm her with proofs.  \"Mirandy, you're cracked,\" said she. \"Ain't you never been to Boston?\"  Miss Crane bridled. This was an uncalled-for insult.  \"I guess I visited down Boston-way oftener than you, Eliza Reed. You never had any clothes.\"  Mrs. Reed's strength was her imperturbability.  \"And you never set eyes on the Brice house, opposite the Common, with the swelled front? I'd like to find out where you were a-visitin'. And you've never heard tell of the Brice homestead, at Westbury, that was Colonel Wilton Brice's, who fought in the Revolution? I'm astonished at you, Mirandy. When I used to be at the Dales', in Mount Vernon Street, in thirty-seven, Mrs. Charles Atterbury Brice used to come there in her carriage, a-callin'. She was Appleton's mother. Severe! Save us,\" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, \"but she was stiff as starched crepe. His father was minister to France. The Brices were in the India trade, and they had money enough to buy the whole of St. Louis.\"  Miss Crane rattled the letter in her hand. She brought forth her reserves.  \"Yes, and Appleton Brice lost it all, in the panic. And then he died, and left the widow and son without a cent.\"  Mrs. Reed took off her spectacles.  \"I want to know!\" she exclaimed. \"The durned fool! Well, Appleton Brice didn't have the family brains, ands he was kind of soft-hearted. I've heard Mehitabel Dale say that.\" She paused to reflect. \"So they're coming here?\" she added. \"I wonder why.\"  Miss Crane's triumph was not over.  \"Because Silas Whipple was some kin to Appleton Brice, and he has offered the boy a place in his law office.\"  Miss Reed laid down her knitting.  \"Save us!\" she said. \"This is a day of wonders, Mirandy. Now Lord help the boy if he's gain' to work for the Judge.\"  \"The Judge has a soft heart, if he is crabbed,\" declared the spinster. \"I've heard say of a good bit of charity he's done. He's a soft heart.\"  \"Soft as a green quince!\" said Mrs. Abner, scornfully. \"How many friends has he?\"  \"Those he has are warm enough,\" Miss Crane retorted. \"Look at Colonel Carvel, who has him to dinner every Sunday.\"  \"That's plain as your nose, Mirandy Crane. They both like quarrellin' better than anything in this world.\"  \"Well,\" said Miss Crane, \"I must go make ready for the Brices.\"  Such was the importance of the occasion, however, that she could not resist calling at Mrs. Merrill's room, and she knocked at Mrs. Chandler's door to tell that lady and her daughter.  No Burke has as yet arisen in this country of ours to write a Peerage. Fame awaits him. Indeed, it was even then awaiting him, at the time of the panic of 1857. With what infinite pains were the pedigree and possessions of the Brice family pieced together that day by the scattered residents from Puritan-land in the City of St. Louis. And few buildings would have borne the wear and tear of many house-cleanings of the kind Miss Crane indulged in throughout the morning and afternoon.  Mr. Eliphalet Hopper, on his return from business, was met on the steps and requested to wear his Sunday clothes. Like the good republican that he was, Mr. Hopper refused. He had ascertained that the golden charm which made the Brices worthy of tribute had been lost. Commercial supremacy,--that was Mr. Hopper's creed. Family is a good thing, but of what use is a crest without the panels on which to paint it? Can a diamond brooch shine on a calico gown? Mr. Hopper deemed church the place for worship. He likewise had his own idol in his closet.  Eliphalet at Willesden had heard a great deal of Boston airs and graces and intellectuality, of the favored few of that city who lived in mysterious houses, and who crossed the sea in ships. He pictured Mrs. Brice asking for a spoon, and young Stephen sniffing at Mrs. Crane's boarding-house. And he resolved with democratic spirit that he would teach Stephen a lesson, if opportunity offered. His own discrepancy between the real and the imagined was no greater than that of the rest of his fellow-boarders.  Barring Eliphalet, there was a dress parade that evening,--silks and bombazines and broadcloths, and Miss Crane's special preserves on the tea-table. Alas, that most of the deserved honors of this world should fall upon barren ground!  The quality which baffled Mr. Hopper, and some other boarders, was simplicity. None save the truly great possess it (but this is not generally known). Mrs. Brice was so natural, that first evening at tea, that all were disappointed. The hero upon the reviewing stand with the halo of the Unknown behind his head is one thing; the lady of Family who sits beside you at a boarding-house and discusses the weather and the journey is quite another. They were prepared to hear Mrs. Brice rail at the dirt of St. Louis and the crudity of the West. They pictured her referring with sighs to her Connections, and bewailing that Stephen could not have finished his course at Harvard.  She did nothing of the sort.  The first shock was so great that Mrs. Abner Reed cried in the privacy of her chamber, and the Widow Crane confessed her disappointment to the confiding ear of her bosom friend, Mrs. Merrill. Not many years later a man named Grant was to be in Springfield, with a carpet bag, despised as a vagabond. A very homely man named Lincoln went to Cincinnati to try a case before the Supreme Court, and was snubbed by a man named Stanton.  When we meet the truly great, several things may happen. In the first place, we begin to believe in their luck, or fate, or whatever we choose to call it, and to curse our own. We begin to respect ourselves the more, and to realize that they are merely clay like us, that we are great men without Opportunity. Sometimes, if we live long enough near the Great, we begin to have misgivings. Then there is hope for us.  Mrs. Brice, with her simple black gowns, quiet manner, and serene face, with her interest in others and none in herself, had a wonderful effect upon the boarders. They were nearly all prepared to be humble. They grew arrogant and pretentious. They asked Mrs. Brice if she knew this and that person of consequence in Boston, with whom they claimed relationship or intimacy. Her answers were amiable and self-contained.  But what shall we say of Stephen Brice? Let us confess at once that it is he who is the hero of this story, and not Eliphalet Hopper. It would be so easy to paint Stephen in shining colors, and to make him a first-class prig (the horror of all novelists), that we must begin with the drawbacks. First and worst, it must be confessed that Stephen had at that time what has been called \"the Boston manner.\" This was not Stephen's fault, but Boston's. Young Mr. Brice possessed that wonderful power of expressing distance in other terms besides ells and furlongs,--and yet he was simple enough with it all.  Many a furtive stare he drew from the table that evening. There were one or two of discernment present, and they noted that his were the generous features of a marked man,--if he chose to become marked. He inherited his mother's look; hers was the face of a strong woman, wide of sympathy, broad of experience, showing peace of mind amid troubles--the touch of femininity was there to soften it.  Her son had the air of the college-bred. In these surroundings he escaped arrogance by the wonderful kindliness of his eye, which lighted when his mother spoke to him. But he was not at home at Miss Crane's table, and he made no attempt to appear at his ease.  This was an unexpected pleasure for Mr. Eliphalet Hopper. Let it not be thought that he was the only one at that table to indulge in a little secret rejoicing. But it was a peculiar satisfaction to him to reflect that these people, who had held up their heads for so many generations, were humbled at last. To be humbled meant, in Mr. Hopper's philosophy, to lose one's money. It was thus he gauged the importance of his acquaintances; it was thus he hoped some day to be gauged. And he trusted and believed that the time would come when he could give his fillip to the upper rim of fortune's wheel, and send it spinning downward.  Mr. Hopper was drinking his tea and silently forming an estimate. He concluded that young Brice was not the type to acquire the money which his father had lost. And he reflected that Stephen must feel as strange in St. Louis as a cod might amongst the cat-fish in the Mississippi. So the assistant manager of Carvel & Company resolved to indulge in the pleasure of patronizing the Bostonian.  \"Callatin' to go to work?\" he asked him, as the boarders walked into the best room.  \"Yes,\" replied Stephen, taken aback. And it may be said here that, if Mr. Hopper underestimated him, certainly he underestimated Mr. Hopper.  \"It ain't easy to get a job this Fall,\" said Eliphalet, \"St. Louis houses have felt the panic.\"  \"I am sorry to hear that.\"  \"What business was you callatin' to grapple with?\"  \"Law,\" said Stephen.  \"Gosh!\" exclaimed Mr. Hopper, \"I want to know.\" In reality he was a bit chagrined, having pictured with some pleasure the Boston aristocrat going from store to store for a situation. \"You didn't come here figurin' on makin' a pile, I guess.\"  \"A what?\"  \"A pile.\"  Stephen looked down and over Mr. Hopper attentively. He took in the blocky shoulders and the square head, and he pictured the little eyes at a vanishing-point in lines of a bargain. Then humor blessed humor--came to his rescue. He had entered the race in the West, where all start equal. He had come here, like this man who was succeeding, to make his living. Would he succeed?  Mr. Hopper drew something out of his pocket, eyed Miss Crane, and bit off a corner.  \"What office was you going into?\" he asked genially. Mr. Brice decided to answer that.  \"Judge Whipple's--unless he has changed his mind.\" Eliphalet gave him a look more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5388"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 01 (#5)"],["body"," than words.  \"Know the Judge?\"  Silent laughter.  \"If all the Fourth of Julys we've had was piled into one,\" said Mr. Hopper, slowly and with conviction, \"they wouldn't be a circumstance to Silas Whipple when he gets mad. My boss, Colonel Carvel, is the only man in town who'll stand up to him. I've seen 'em begin a quarrel in the store and carry it all the way up the street. I callate you won't stay with him a great while.\"     CHAPTER IV  BLACK CATTLE  Later that evening Stephen Brice was sitting by the open windows in his mother's room, looking on the street-lights below.  \"Well, my dear,\" asked the lady, at length, \"what do you think of it all?\"  \"They are kind people,\" he said.  \"Yes, they are kind,\" she assented, with a sigh. \"But they are not--they are not from among our friends, Stephen.\"  \"I thought that one of our reasons for coming West, mother,\" answered Stephen.  His mother looked pained.  \"Stephen, how can you! We came West in order that you might have more chance for the career to which you are entitled. Our friends in Boston were more than good.\"  He left the window and came and stood behind her chair, his hands clasped playfully beneath her chin.  \"Have you the exact date about you, mother?\"  \"What date, Stephen?\"  \"When I shall leave St. Louis for the United States Senate. And you must not forget that there is a youth limit in our Constitution for senators.\"  Then the widow smiled,--a little sadly, perhaps. But still a wonderfully sweet smile. And it made her strong face akin to all that was human and helpful.  \"I believe that you have the subject of my first speech in that august assembly. And, by the way, what was it?\"  \"It was on 'The Status of the Emigrant,'\" she responded instantly, thereby proving that she was his mother.  \"And it touched the Rights of Privacy,\" he added, laughing, \"which do not seem to exist in St. Louis boarding-houses.\"  \"In the eyes of your misguided profession, statesmen and authors and emigrants and other public charges have no Rights of Privacy,\" said she. \"Mr. Longfellow told me once that they were to name a brand of flour for him, and that he had no redress.\"  \"Have you, too, been up before Miss Crane's Commission?\" he asked, with amused interest.  His mother laughed.  \"Yes,\" she said quietly.  \"They have some expert members,\" he continued. \"This Mrs. Abner Reed could be a shining light in any bar. I overheard a part of her cross-examination. She--she had evidently studied our case--\"  \"My dear,\" answered Mrs. Brice, \"I suppose they know all about us.\" She was silent a moment, I had so hoped that they wouldn't. They lead the same narrow life in this house that they did in their little New England towns. They--they pity us, Stephen.\"  \"Mother!\"  \"I did not expect to find so many New Englanders here--I wish that Mr. Whipple had directed us elsewhere-\"  \"He probably thought that we should feel at home among New Englanders. I hope the Southerners will be more considerate. I believe they will,\" he added.  \"They are very proud,\" said his mother. \"A wonderful people,--born aristocrats. You don't remember those Randolphs with whom we travelled through England. They were with us at Hollingdean, Lord Northwell's place. You were too small at the time. There was a young girl, Eleanor Randolph, a beauty. I shall never forget the way she entered those English drawing-rooms. They visited us once in Beacon Street, afterwards. And I have heard that there are a great many good Southern families here in St. Louis.\"  \"You did not glean that from Judge Whipple's letter, mother,\" said Stephen, mischievously.  \"He was very frank in his letter,\" sighed Mrs. Brice.  \"I imagine he is always frank, to put it delicately.\"  \"Your father always spoke in praise of Silas Whipple, my dear. I have heard him call him one of the ablest lawyers in the country. He won a remarkable case for Appleton here, and he once said that the Judge would have sat on the Supreme Bench if he had not been pursued with such relentlessness by rascally politicians.\"  \"The Judge indulges in a little relentlessness now and then, himself. He is not precisely what might be termed a mild man, if what we hear is correct.\"  Mrs. Brice started.  \"What have you heard?\" she asked.  \"Well, there was a gentleman on the steamboat who said that it took more courage to enter the Judge's private office than to fight a Border Ruffian. And another, a young lawyer, who declared that he would rather face a wild cat than ask Whipple a question on the new code. And yet he said that the Judge knew more law than any man in the West. And lastly, there is a polished gentleman named Hopper here from Massachusetts who enlightened me a little more.\"  Stephen paused and bit his tongue. He saw that she was distressed by these things. Heaven knows that she had borne enough trouble in the last few months.  \"Come, mother,\" he said gently, \"you should know how to take my jokes by this time. I didn't mean it. I am sure the Judge is a good man,--one of those aggressive good men who make enemies. I have but a single piece of guilt to accuse him of.\"  \"And what is that?\" asked the widow.  \"The cunning forethought which he is showing in wishing to have it said that a certain Senator and Judge Brice was trained in his office.\"  \"Stephen--you goose!\" she said.  Her eye wandered around the room,--Widow Crane's best bedroom. It was dimly lighted by an extremely ugly lamp. The hideous stuffy bed curtains and the more hideous imitation marble mantel were the two objects that held her glance. There was no change in her calm demeanor. But Stephen, who knew his mother, felt that her little elation over her arrival had ebbed, Neither would confess dejection to the other.  \"I--even I--\" said Stephen, tapping his chest, \"have at least made the acquaintance of one prominent citizen, Mr. Eliphalet D. Hopper. According to Mr. Dickens, he is a true American gentleman, for he chews tobacco. He has been in St. Louis five years, is now assistant manager of the largest dry goods house, and still lives in one of Miss Crane's four-dollar rooms. I think we may safely say that he will be a millionaire before I am a senator.\"  He paused.  \"And mother?\"  \"Yes, dear.\"  He put his hands in his pockets and walked over to the window.  \"I think that it would be better if I did the same thing.\"  \"What do you mean, my son--\"  \"If I went to work,--started sweeping out a store, I mean. See here, mother, you've sacrificed enough for me already. After paying father's debts, we've come out here with only a few thousand dollars, and the nine hundred I saved out of this year's Law School allowance. What shall we do when that is gone? The honorable legal profession, as my friend reminded me to-night, is not the swiftest road to millions.\"  With a mother's discernment she guessed the agitation, he was striving to hide; she knew that he had been gathering courage for this moment for months. And she knew that he was renouncing thus lightly, for her sake an ambition he had had from his school days.  Widow passed her hand over her brow. It was a space before she answered him.  \"My son,\" she said, let us never speak of this again:  \"It was your father's dearest wish that you should become a lawyer and --and his wishes are sacred God will take care of us.\"  She rose and kissed him good-night.  \"Remember, my dear, when you go to Judge Whipple in the morning, remember his kindness, and--.\"  \"And keep my temper. I shall, mother.\"  A while later he stole gently back into her room again. She was on her knees by the walnut bedstead.  At nine the next manning Stephen left Miss Crane's, girded for the struggle with the redoubtable Silas Whipple. He was not afraid, but a poor young man as an applicant to a notorious dragon is not likely to be bandied with velvet, even though the animal had been a friend of his father. Dragons as a rule have had a hard rime in their youths, and believe in others having a hard time.  To a young man, who as his father's heir in Boston had been the subject of marked consideration by his elders, the situation was keenly distasteful. But it had to be gone through. So presently, after inquiry, he came to the open square where the new Court House stood, the dome of which was indicated by a mass of staging, and one wing still to be completed. Across from the building, on Market Street, and in the middle of the block, what had once been a golden hand pointed up a narrow dusty stairway.  Here was a sign, \"Law office of Silas Whipple.\"  Stephen climbed the stairs, and arrived at a ground glass door, on which the sign was repeated. Behind that door was the future: so he opened it fearfully, with an impulse to throw his arm above his head. But he was struck dumb on beholding, instead of a dragon, a good-natured young man who smiled a broad welcome. The reaction was as great as though one entered a dragon's den, armed to the teeth, to find a St. Bernard doing the honors.  Stephen's heart went out to this young man,--after that organ had jumped back into its place. This keeper of the dragon looked the part. Even the long black coat which custom then decreed could not hide the bone and sinew under it. The young man had a broad forehead, placid Dresden-blue eyes, flaxen hair, and the German coloring. Across one of his high cheek-bones was a great jagged scar which seemed to add distinction to his appearance. That caught Stephen's eye, and held it. He wondered whether it were the result of an encounter with the Judge.  \"You wish to see Mr. Whipple?\" he asked, in the accents of an educated German.  \"Yes,\" said Stephen, \"if he isn't busy.\"  \"He is out,\" said the other, with just a suspicion of a 'd' in the word. \"You know he is much occupied now, fighting election frauds. You read the papers?\"  \"I am a stranger here,\" said Stephen.  \"Ach!\" exclaimed the German, \"now I know you, Mr. Brice. The young one from Boston the Judge spoke of. But you did not tell him of your arrival.\"  \"I did not wish to"]]]
