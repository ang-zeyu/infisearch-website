The ushers, best man, and groom        may come after the dinner to attend the wedding        rehearsal. These rehearsals should be        gone through carefully, and if they can be        held at the church so much the better. Each        person should be instructed by note as to their        duties, as this prevents confusion.    CHURCH. On the wedding-day, after receiving        the bridesmaids and maid of honor at her        house, she goes to the church with her father         (or nearest male relative), and leans upon his        arm as they proceed up the aisle, following        the bridesmaids, and carrying her bridal bouquet         (or, if she wishes, a prayer-book).         Arriving at the chancel, she leaves her        father and steps forward to take the left arm        of the groom, who advances from the chancel        to meet her. They stand before the clergyman,        and, if they wish, may kneel, and upon        rising stand about a foot apart.         At the words of the ceremony, \"Who giveth        this woman away?\" or, \"To be married to this        man?\" her father advances and places her        right hand in that of the clergyman, who        places it in the groom's right hand. After        this her father retires to his seat in the pew        with his family.         When the plighting of the troth comes, the        groom receives the ring from the best man        and hands it to the bride, who gives it to the        clergyman. He returns it to the groom, who        then places it on the third finger of the bride's        left hand. When plighting the troth, the        bride gives her glove and bouquet to the maid        of honor, or, what is better, the finger of the        glove may be cut to allow the ring to be placed        on without the glove being removed.         The kiss at the altar is no longer in good        form.         At the end of the ceremony, after the clergyman        has congratulated the married couple,        the bride takes her husband's right arm and        they lead the procession to the vestibule, where        they receive the congratulations of near        friends. Here the maid of honor and bridesmaids        cloak and prepare the bride for the trip        home in the groom's carriage.    DRESS. The bride is veiled, and is dressed in        white-full dress, day or evening. Gloves        need not be worn in the church. The bridesmaids        provide their own outfit, unless the        bride asks them to dress in a style of her own        selecting. In this case, she supplies them        gowns, hats, gloves, and shoes, as she may        wish.    FAREWELL LUNCHEON. While a farewell luncheon        given to the bridesmaids by the bride        is not necessary, yet it is a pleasant way for a        woman to entertain her female friends the        last time in her father's house.         On this occasion it is a good plan for the        bride to give to the maid of honor and brides-maids        her souvenirs, which, of course, should        be alike, and of use at the wedding ceremony.    GIFTS. The bride may give to the groom a ring        as an engagement ring if she wishes. She        should make suitable gifts to the bridesmaids        as souvenirs of the occasion, and may also        present them with flowers. If she presents        boutonnieres to the best man and the ushers,        they should appear at her house before the        ceremony and have her place them in the        lapel of their coats.         She should acknowledge immediately the        receipt of all wedding gifts.    GLOVES. The bride need not wear gloves in the        church.    INVITATIONS. At a church wedding the bride        usually provides the bridesmaids with extra        invitations for their personal use.    KISS. Only the parents of the bride and her        most intimate relatives should kiss the bride.        It is now no longer good form for all to do so.    SEEING GROOM ON WEDDING-DAY. It is not        customary for the bride to see the groom on        the wedding-day till she meets him at the        altar.    WEDDING BREAKFAST. The bride and groom        occupy the centre one of the small tables.         At all wedding breakfasts it is customary        for the guests to assemble in the drawing-room,        and then to enter the breakfast-room        together--the bride and groom leading the        way.         It is not usual to have the bridal cake at        a wedding breakfast, but if such is the case,        the bride makes the first cut, and the slices        are given first to those at the bridal table.    WEDDING RECEPTION. She should stand by her        husband's side to receive the best wishes of all        present. The guests are not announced, but        are introduced by the ushers to the bride if        not known to her.         The bride should not leave her place to        mingle with the guests until all have been        introduced to her.    BRIDE'S FAMILY. See FAMILY OF BRIDE.    BRIDE'S FATHER. See FATHER OF BRIDE.    BRIDE'S MOTHER. See MOTHER OF BRIDE.    BRIDEGROOM. See GROOM.    BRIDESMAIDS. The bridesmaids are selected by the        bride, and number six, eight, or twelve--        mostly eight. She usually gives them a        dinner a few days before the wedding, at        which she shows them the trousseau and discusses        the details of the wedding.         The ushers and the groom are invited to        come after the dinner, and then the rehearsal        takes place. The bridesmaids should be        present at this and all other rehearsals, and        if unable to be present at the wedding should        give the bride ample notice, that a substitute        may be secured.    CALLS. They call upon the mother of the bride        within a week or ten days after the ceremony,        and upon the bride, in her own home, after        her return from her wedding trip.    CARRIAGES. A carriage provided by the family        of the bride calls for the bridesmaid on the        wedding-day, and takes her to the bride's        house. Her carriage follows the bride's to the        church, and, after the ceremony, takes her to        the wedding breakfast or reception.    CHURCH. They meet at the house of the bride,        and there take their carriages to the church.        While their carriages follow that of the bride,        they alight first and receive her in the vestibule.        They may carry bouquets supplied by        the bride's family or the groom.         In the procession up the aisle they follow        the ushers, walking two by two, and as the        ushers approach the altar they divide--one-half        to the right and one-half to the left. The        bridesmaids do likewise, leaving space for        the bridal party to pass.         In the procession down the aisle they follow        the best man and maid of honor to the        vestibule, where, after giving their best wishes        to the bride, and congratulations to the        groom, they return to the bride's home to        assist in entertaining the guests at the reception        or breakfast.    DANCING. At the wedding breakfast or reception        dancing is sometimes indulged in.    DINNER TO MARRIED COUPLE. The bridesmaids        usually give a dinner to the married couple        on the latter's return from their wedding trip.    DRESS. They usually follow the wishes of the        bride in the matter of dress. Should she        desire any particular style of dress, entailing        considerable expense, on account of novelty        or oddity, she usually presents them the outfit,        which it is permissible for them to accept.         If the bride has no particular wish, they        decide the matter among themselves, always        bearing in mind that their style of dress and        material must be subordinated to that of the        bride, and that there could be no greater exhibition        of lack of refinement and good taste        than for any bridesmaid to make herself in        any way more attractive than the bride.    GIFTS. It is customary for them to send a wedding        gift to the bride.         They usually receive a pretty souvenir        from the bride and a bouquet from the        groom.    INVITATIONS. At a large church wedding several        invitations are usually given to the        bridesmaids for their own personal use.    REHEARSALS. They should be present at all        rehearsals.    WEDDING BREAKFASTS. They pair off with the        ushers, and are usually seated at a table by        themselves.    WEDDING RECEPTIONS. They stand beside the        married couple, and are introduced to the        guests.    BROTHER AT DEBUT. A brother, when his sister's        debut takes the form of a supper or dinner,        should take his sister (the debutante) into        dinner or supper.    BUTLER--TIPS. It is customary for a man leaving a        house-party where he has been a guest to        tip the butler who acted as a valet.    CABINET ( U. S,), MEMBER OF--HOW ADDRESSED. An        official letter begins: Sir, and ends: I have,        sir, the honor to remain your most obedient        servant.         A social letter begins: My dear Mr. Wilson,        and ends: I have the honor to remain        most sincerely yours.         The address on the envelope is: Hon. John        J. Wilson, Secretary of State.    CAKE. is broken into pieces, the size of a mouthful,        and then eaten with fingers or fork.    CALLS. Unless close intimacy exists, calls should        only be made on the specified days.    ASKING MEN TO CALL ON WOMEN. A debutante        should leave this matter to her mother        or chaperone.         A young woman, until she has had some        experience in society, should be very careful        in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#6)"],["body","men to call.         She should not invite a man to call whom        she has met for the first time. No man        should be invited to call until she is assured        of his social standing and character.         In some parts of the country men first ask        permission to call, and in other parts women        first ask men to call.    ASKING WOMEN TO CALL ON WOMEN. It is        generally the custom for the married or elder        woman to ask the unmarried or younger        woman to call.    BACHELORS' DINNERS. See BACHELORS' DINNERS        --CALLS.    BREAKFAST. See BREAKFASTS--CALLS.    BEST MAN. See BEST MAN--CALLS    BRIDESMAIDS. See BRIDESMAIDS--CALLS.    CHAPERONES. See CHAPERONES--MEN CALLING.    BUSINESS. A business man may call in street        dress upon a woman before six o'clock.         Social visits may be made in the same        manner.    DAYS AT HOME. Calls should only be made on        the regular \"At Home\" days, and the        hostess should always be present on that day.        Very intimate friends may set aside this rule.    DEBUTANTE. See DEBUTANTE--CALLS.    DRESS. When making an afternoon call, a man        would wear afternoon dress, and evening        dress in making an evening call.    HIGH TEA. See HIGH TEA--CALLS.    HOURS. When no special day for receiving is        indicated, calls may be made at any proper        hour, according to the custom of the locality.        Men of leisure may call at the fashionable        hours from two till five in the afternoon, while        business and professional men may call between        eight and nine in the evening, as their        obligations prevent them from observing the        fashionable hours.    LENGTH. A formal call may last from fifteen to        thirty minutes. Old friends may stay longer.    LUNCHEONS. See LUNCHEON--CALLS.    MEN. AFTER ENTERTAINMENTS. After an entertainment        a man should call in person on        host and hostess, whether the invitation was        accepted or not. If a card is sent or mailed,        it should be accompanied with an apology.         To call on an acquaintance in an opera        box does not relieve one of the duty of making        a formal call in return for social favors.         When calling on the hostess but not on        the host, a man should leave a card for him.        If the hostess be out, he should leave two        cards.         Married men can return their social obligations        to women by personal calls, or the        women of the family can leave the men's        cards with their own.         A call should be made the day following a        luncheon or a breakfast; the same after a        dinner, or at least within a week. A call        should be made within a week after a ball.         After a theatre party given by a man, he        should call within three days on the woman        he escorted, or leave his card, and should        call within a week on the remainder of his        guests.    MEN CALLING ON MEN. At the beginning of        the season it is usual to leave a card for each        member of a family called on--one card for        husband, wife, \"misses,\" and guest, or rest        of the family. Sometimes two cards answer        the purpose.         They may be sent by mail or messenger.    MEN CALLING ON WOMEN. A man should call        only on \"At Home\" days, especially when        making the first call, unless specially invited.        He should call at the hour appointed.         When no special day for receiving is indicated,        calls may be made at any proper hour,        according to the custom of the locality. Men        of leisure may call at the fashionable hours        --from two till five o'clock.         Business and professional men may call        between eight and nine o'clock, as their obligations        prevent them from observing the        fashionable hours.         A business man may call in street dress        before six o'clock, and the same dress in the        evening, if intimately acquainted.         Informal calls may be made on Sunday        after three o'clock by business and professional        men, provided there are no religious or        other scruples on the part of those receiving        the calls.         Evening or other than mere formal calls        should not be made, save by special invitation.         The first call should last not longer than        ten or fifteen minutes. It is correct to ask        for all the women of the family.         At the first call he should give his card at        the door. At following calls it is optional        whether to give a card or merely the name,        asking at the same time for the person one        desires to see. When the servant's intelligence        seems doubtful, or the name is an        unusual one, it is safer to give a card.         When a woman invites a man to call without        specifying when, it is not considered as        an invitation at all, but merely as a formal        courtesy.         It is bad form to solicit by innuendo or        otherwise an invitation to call from a woman.        It is her privilege to make the first move in        such matters; otherwise she would be placed        in an embarrassing position.         When an invitation specifies the hour,        every effort should be made to be punctual.        It is impolite to be too early or too late.         At a formal call, when others are present,        a man should not be seated unless invited to        do so. He should leave as others come in,        and not remain longer than ten or fifteen        minutes.         A man having a card or letter of introduction        to a young woman should present it in        person to the chaperone. If she is out, he        should mail it to her, and she should at once        notify him whether he may call.         If a caller is a stranger to the young        woman's hostess, he should send his card to        the latter and ask to see her.         The chaperone may, if desirable, give a        man permission to call upon the woman        under her charge.         A man should not call upon an unmarried        woman until invited by her to do so. He        may ask a married woman who has a family        for permission to call.    GLOVES. Gloves need not be removed at a formal        or brief call.    ENTERTAINMENTS. At entertainments a man        should give his card to the servant at the        door or leave it in the hall.         A few appropriate words of greeting should        be addressed to the hostess and host as soon        after entering as possible.         Personal introductions are not absolutely        required at musicales, teas, \"At Homes,\" etc.        One may converse with those nearest, but        this does not warrant future recognition.         When light repasts are served, as teas, ices,        etc, a man should put his napkin on his        knee and hold the plate in his hand.         He should depart with as little ceremony        as possible--a bow and a smile, if host and        hostess are engaged, are sufficient. He        should not shake hands and try to speak unless        it can be done without becoming conspicuous.    MEN CALLING ON WOMEN--HAT. A man making        a formal or brief call should carry his        hat in his hand into the parlor.    SHAKING HANDS. A man should not offer to        shake hands first, as that is the privilege of        the women.    MEN--DRESS. In making ceremonious calls, men        wear afternoon dress, and after six o'clock        evening dress.           See also AFTERNOON DRESS--MEN. EVENING          DRESS--MEN.    PALL-BEARERS. See PALL-BEARERS--CALLS.    THEATRE. See THEATRE--CALLS.    USHERS. See USHERS--CALLS.    WEDDING INVITATIONS. Very intimate friends        can call personally. Friends of the groom        who have no acquaintance with the bride's        family should send their cards to those inviting        them.         Those who do not receive wedding invitations,        announcement, or \"At Home\" cards        should not call on the married couple, but        consider themselves as dropped from their        circle of acquaintance.    WOMEN RECEIVING AND INVITING MEN. The        invitation to call should be extended by the        woman, and if she does not specify the time,        will naturally be considered as an act of        courtesy, but not as an invitation.         These invitations should be given with great        care by young women. It is better to have        the invitation extended by her mother or        chaperone.         A married woman may ask a man to call,        especially if she have unmarried daughters.        An afternoon tea is an appropriate time to        specify. A man may ask a married woman        who has a family for permission to call.         At the beginning of a season, a man who        desires the further acquaintance of a woman        should leave his card in person for all the        members of the family.         A formal call, or the first call of the season,        should, mot last longer than ten or fifteen        minutes. It is proper for the man to inquire        for all the women of the family.         A man should call only on \"At Home\"        days, unless especially invited to come at        other times. The hostess should be home on        all \"At Home\" days, unless sickness or        other good cause prevents.         In the absence of \"At Home\" days, or        specified time, calls may be received at any        proper hour, according to the locality of the        place.         When men make a formal call at other than        specified time, the hostess may justly excuse        herself. The caller would have no ground        for offense.         Intimate friends need not hold to formal        hours for paying calls.         Men of leisure should call only at fashionable        hours--from two to five in the afternoon.     "]]]
