A minute later the rumbling of the thunder ceased for the time being, and they heard a murmur of voices coming from one of the rooms of the lodge.  “Why, somebody must be here!” ejaculated Ned. “Who can it be?”  “Two men, by their voices,” answered the hermit's boy. “Wait till I take a look at them?”  “Why not go in?” questioned the rich youth, carelessly.  “They may not be persons that we would care to meet, Ned. You know there are some undesirable characters about the lake.”  “That's true.”  Not far off was a narrow window, the panes of glass of which had long since been broken out. Moving toward this, Joe peered into the apartment beyond.  Close to an old fireplace, in which a few sticks of half-green timber were burning, sat two men. Both were well dressed, and Joe rightfully surmised that they were from the city. Each wore a hunting outfit and had a gun, but neither had any game.  “We came on a wild-goose chase,” grumbled one, as he stirred the fire. “Got nothing but a soaking for our pains.”  “Never mind, Malone,” returned the other, who was evidently the better educated of the two. “As we had to make ourselves scarce in the city this was as good a place to come to as any.”  “Don't you think they'll look for us here?”  “Why should they? We were sharp enough not to leave any trail behind--at least, I was.”  “Reckon I was just as sharp, Caven.”  “You had to be--otherwise you would have been nabbed.” Gaff Caven chuckled to himself. “We outwitted them nicely, I must say. We deserve credit.”  “I've spent more than half of what I got out of the deal,” went on Pat Malone, for such was the full name of one of the speakers.  “I've spent more than that. But never mind, my boy, fortune will favor us again in the near future.”  A crash of thunder drowned out the conversation following, and Joe hurried back to where he had left Ned.  “Well, have you found out who they are?” demanded the rich youth, impatiently.  “No, Ned, but I am sure of one thing.”  “What is that?”  “They are two bad men.”  “What makes you think that?”  “They said something about having to get out of the city, and one spoke about being nabbed. Evidently they went away to avoid arrest.”  At this announcement Ned Talmadge whistled softly to himself.  “Phew! What shall we do about it?” he asked, with a look of concern on his usually passive face.  Joe shrugged his shoulders.  “I don't know what to do.”  “Let us listen to what they have to say. Maybe we'll strike some clew to what they have been doing.”  “Would that be fair--to play the eaves-dropper?”  “Certainly--if they are evildoers. Anybody who has done wrong ought to be locked up for it,” went on Ned boldly.  With caution the two boys made their way to the narrow window, and Ned looked in as Joe had done. The backs of the two men were still towards the opening, so the lads were not discovered.  “What is this new game?” they heard the man called Malone ask, after a peal of thunder had rolled away among the mountains.  “It's the old game of a sick miner with some valuable stocks to sell,”  answered Gaff Caven.  “Have you got the stocks?”  “To be sure--one thousand shares of the Blue Bell Mine, of Montana, said to be worth exactly fifty thousand dollars.”  “Phew! You're flying high, Gaff!” laughed Pat Malone.  “And why not, so long as I sell the stocks?”  “What did they cost you?”  “Well, they didn't cost me fifty thousand dollars,” and Gaff Caven closed one eye suggestively.  “You bet they didn't! More than likely they didn't cost you fifty dollars.”  “What, such elegantly engraved stocks as those?”  “Pooh! I can buy a bushel-basket full of worthless stocks for a dollar,”  came from Pat Malone. “But that isn't here nor there. I go into the deal if you give me my fair share of the earnings.”  “I'll give you one-third, Pat, and that's a fair share, I think.”  “Why not make it half?”  “Because I'll do the most of the work. It's no easy matter to find a victim.” And Gaff Caven laughed broadly. He had a good-appearing face, but his eyes were small and not to be trusted.  “All right, I'll go in for a third then. But how soon is the excitement to begin?”  “Oh, in a week or so. I've got the advertisements in the papers already.”  “Not in New York?”  “No, it's Philadelphia this time. Perhaps I'll land one of our Quaker friends.”  “Don't be so sure. The Quakers may be slow but they generally know what they are doing.”  More thunder interrupted the conversation at this point, and when it was resumed the two men talked in such low tones that only an occasional word could be caught by the two boys.  “They surely must be rascals,” remarked Ned, in a whisper. “I'm half of a mind to have them locked up.”  “That's easier said than done,” answered Joe. “Besides, we haven't any positive proofs against them.”  The wind was now rising, and it soon blew so furiously that the two boys were forced to seek the shelter of the woodshed, since they did not deem it wise to enter the lodge so long as the two men were inside. They waited in the shed for fully half an hour, when, as suddenly as it had begun, the storm let up and the sun began to peep forth from between the scattering clouds.  “Now we can go home if we wish,” said Joe. “But for my part, I'd like to stay and see what those men do, and where they go to.”  “Yes, let us stay by all means,” answered the rich youth.  They waited a few minutes longer and then Ned suggested that they look into the window of the lodge once more. The hermit's boy was willing, and they approached the larger building with caution.  Much to their astonishment the two strangers had disappeared.  “Hullo! what do you make of that?” cried Ned, in amazement.  “Perhaps they are in one of the other rooms,” suggested Joe.  At the risk of being caught, they entered the lodge and looked into one room after another. Every apartment was vacant, and they now saw that the fire in the fireplace had been stamped out.  “They must have left while we were in the woodshed,” said Ned.  “Maybe they are out on the lake,” answered the hermit's boy, and he ran down to the water's edge, followed by his companion. But though they looked in every direction, not a craft of any kind was to be seen.  “Joe, they didn't take to the water, consequently they must have left by one of the mountain paths.”  “That is true, and if they did they'll have no nice time in getting through. All the bushes are sopping wet, and the mud is very slippery in places.”  They walked to the rear of the lodge and soon found the footprints of the two strangers. They led through the bushes and were lost at a small brook that ran into the lake.  “There is no use of our trying to follow this any further,” said Joe. “You'll get your clothing covered with water and mud.”  “I don't intend to follow,” answered Ned. “Just the same, I should like to know more about those fellows.”  “I wish I had seen their faces.”  “Yes, it's a pity we didn't get a better look at them. But I'd know their voices.”  By the time they gave up the hunt the sun was shining brightly. Both walked to where the boat had been left, and Joe turned the craft over so that the water might run out. Then he mopped off the seats as best he could.  Ned wanted to go directly home, and he and Joe rowed the craft in the direction of Riverside. As they passed along the lake shore the hermit's boy noted that several trees had been struck by lightning.  “I'm glad the lightning didn't strike the lodge while we were there,”  said he.  “It was certainly a severe storm while it lasted, Joe. By the way, shall I say anything about those two men?”  “Perhaps it won't do any harm to tell your father, Ned.”  “Very well, I'll do it.”  Soon Riverside was reached, and having paid for the fish and the outing, Ned Talmadge walked in the direction of his residence. Joe shoved off from the tiny dock and struck out for his home. He did not dream of the calamity that awaited him there.    CHAPTER III.   A HOME IN RUINS.   As Joe rowed toward his home on the mountain side, a good mile from Riverside, he could not help but think of the two mysterious men and of what they had said.  “They were certainly rascals,” he mused. “And from their talk they must have come from New York and are now going to try some game in Philadelphia.”  The hermit's boy was tired out by the day's outing, yet he pulled a fairly quick stroke and it was not long before he reached the dock at which he and Hiram Bodley were in the habit of leaving their boat. He cleaned the craft out, hid the oars in the usual place, and then, with his fishing lines in one hand and a good sized fish in the other, started up the trail leading to the place that he called home.  “What a place to come to, alongside of the one Ned lives in,” he said to himself. “I suppose the Talmadges think this is a regular hovel. I wish we could afford something better,--or at least live in town. It's lonesome here with nobody but old Uncle Hiram around.”  As Joe neared the cabin something seemed to come over him and, for some reason he could not understand, he felt very much depressed in spirits. He quickened his pace, until a turn of the trail brought the homestead into view.  A cry of alarm broke from his lips and with good reason. The little shelter had stood close to a large hemlock tree. The lightning had struck the tree, causing it to topple ever. In falling, it had landed fairly and squarely upon the cabin, smashing it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/528"],["title","Joe the Hotel Boy; Or, Winning out (#2)"],["body","ely. One corner of the cabin was in ashes, but the heavy rain had probably extinguished the conflagration.  “Uncle Hiram!” cried the boy, as soon as he recovered from his amazement. “Uncle Hiram, where are you?”  There was no answer to this call and for the moment Joe's heart seemed to stop beating. Was the old hermit under that pile of ruins? If so it was more than likely he was dead.  Dropping his fish and his lines, the youth sprang to the front of the cabin. The door had fallen to the ground and before him was a mass of wreckage with a small hollow near the bottom. He dropped on his knees and peered inside.  “Uncle Hiram!” he called again.  There was no answer, and he listened with bated breath. Then he fancied he heard a groan, coming from the rear of what was left of the cabin. He ran around to that point and pulled aside some boards and a broken window sash.  “Uncle Hiram, are you here?”  “Joe!” came in a low voice, full of pain. The man tried to say more but could not.  Hauling aside some more boards, Joe now beheld the hermit, lying flat on his back, with a heavy beam resting on his chest. He was also suffering from a cut on the forehead and from a broken ankle.  “This is too bad, Uncle Hiram!” he said, in a trembling voice. “I'll get you out just as soon as I can.”  “Be--be careful, Joe--I--I--my ribs must be broken,” gasped the hermit.  “I'll be careful,” answered the boy, and began to pull aside one board after another. Then he tugged away at the beam but could not budge it.  “Raise it up Joe--it--is--crushing the life ou--out of me,” said the hermit faintly.  “I'll pry it up,” answered the boy, and ran off to get a block of wood. Then he procured a stout pole and with this raised the heavy beam several inches.  “Can you crawl out, Uncle Hiram?”  There was no answer, and Joe saw that the man had fainted from exhaustion. Fixing the pole so it could not slip, he caught hold of the hermit and dragged him to a place of safety.  Joe had never had to care for a hurt person before and he scarcely knew how to proceed. He laid the hermit on the grass and washed his face with water. Soon Hiram Bodley opened his eyes once more.  “My chest!” he groaned. “All of my ribs must be broken! And my ankle is broken, too!” And he groaned again.  “I had better get a doctor, Uncle Hiram.”  “A doctor can't help me.”  “Perhaps he can.”  “I haven't any faith in doctors. A doctor operated on my mother and killed her.”  “But Doctor Gardner is a nice man. He will do all he can for you, I am sure,” urged Joe.  “Well, Dr. Gardner is a good fellow I admit. If you--can--can get him--I'll--I'll--” The sufferer tried to go on but could not.  “I think I can get him. But I hate to leave you alone.” And Joe stared around helplessly. He wished he had Ned with him.  “Never mind--give me a drink--then go,” answered Hiram Bodley. He had often taken Doctor Gardner out to hunt with him and liked the physician not a little.  Inside of five minutes Joe was on the way to the doctor's residence, which was on the outskirts of Riverside. He had left the hermit as comfortable as possible, on a mattress and covered with a cloth to keep off the night air,--for it was now growing late and the sun had set behind the mountains.  Tired though he was the boy pulled with might and main, and so reached the dock of the physician's home in a short space of time. Running up the walk of the neatly-kept garden, he mounted the piazza and rang the bell several times.  “What's the matter?” asked Doctor Gardner, who came himself to answer the summons.  “Our cabin is in ruins, because of the storm, and Mr. Bodley is badly hurt,” answered Joe, and related some of the particulars.  “This is certainly too bad, my boy,” said the physician. “I'll come at once and do what I can for him.”  He ran for a case of instruments and also for some medicines, and then followed Joe back to the boat.  “You act as if you were tired,” said the doctor, after he had watched Joe at the oars for several minutes.  “I am tired, sir--I've been rowing a good deal to-day. But I guess I can make it.”  “Let me row,” said the physician, and took the oars. He was a fine oarsman, and the trip was made in half the time it would have taken Joe to cover the distance.  At the dock there was a lantern, used by Joe and the hermit when they went fishing at night. This was lit, and the two hurried up the trail to the wreck of the cabin.  Hiram Bodley was resting where Joe had left him. He was breathing with difficulty and did not at first recognize the doctor.  “Take it off!” he murmured. “Take it off! It is--is crushing th--the life out of--of me!”  “Mr. Bodley--Hiram, don't you know me?” asked Doctor Gardner, kindly.  “Oh! So it's you? I guess you can't do much, doctor, can you? I--I'm done for!” And a spasm of pain crossed the sufferer's face.  “While there is life there is hope,” answered the physician, noncommittally. He recognized at once that Hiram Bodley's condition was critical.  “He'll get over it, won't he?” questioned Joe, quickly.  The doctor did not answer, but turned to do what he could for the hurt man. He felt of his chest and listened to his breathing, and then administered some medicine.  “His ankle is hurt, too,” said Joe.  “Never mind the ankle just now, Joe,” was the soft answer.  There was something in the tone that alarmed the boy and he caught the physician by the arm.  “Doctor, tell me the truth!” he cried. “Is he is he going to die?”  “I am afraid so, my lad. His ribs are crushed and one of them has stuck into his right lung.”  At these words the tears sprang into the boy's eyes and it was all he could do to keep from crying outright. Even though the old hermit had been rough in his ways, Joe thought a good deal of the man.  “Cannot you do something, doctor,” he pleaded.  “Not here. We might do something in a hospital, but he would not survive the journey. He is growing weaker every moment. Be brave, my lad. It is a terrible trial, I know, but you must remember that all things are for the best.”  Joe knelt beside the sufferer and took hold of his hand. Hiram Bodley looked at him and then at the doctor.  “I--I can't live--I know it,” he said hoarsely. “Joe, stay by me till I die, won't you?”  “Yes!” faltered the boy. “Oh, this is awful!”  “I'm sorry to leave you so soon, Joe--I--I thought I'd be--be able to do something for you some day.”  “You have done something for me, Uncle Hiram.”  “All I've got goes to you, Joe. Doctor, do you hear that?”  “I do.”  “It--it ain't much, but it's something. The blue box--I put it in the blue box--” Here the sufferer began to cough.  “The blue box?” came from Joe questioningly.  “Yes, Joe, all in the blue box--the papers and the money--And the blue box is--is--” Again the sufferer began to cough. “I--I want water!” he gasped.  The water was brought and he took a gulp. Then he tried to speak again, but the effort was in vain. The doctor and Joe raised him up.  “Uncle Hiram! Speak to me!” cried the boy.  But Hiram Bodley was past speaking. He had passed to the Great Beyond.    CHAPTER IV.   THE SEARCH FOR THE BLUE BOX.   Three days after his tragic death Hiram Bodley was buried. Although he was fairly well known in the lake region only a handful of people came to his funeral. Joe was the chief mourner, and it can honestly be said that he was much downcast when he followed the hermit to his last resting place.  After the funeral several asked Joe what he intended to do. He could not answer the question.  “Have you found that blue box?” questioned Doctor Gardner.  “No, sir, I have not thought of it.”  “Probably it contains money and papers of value, Joe.”  “I am going to look for it to-day,” said the boy. “I--I couldn't look for it while--while--”  “I understand. Well, I trust you locate the box and that it contains all you hope for,” added the physician.  As luck would have it, Ned Talmadge's family had just gone away on a trip to the West, so Mr. Talmadge could offer the boy no assistance. But Ned was on hand and did what he could.  “You don't know what you'll do next, do you, Joe?” asked Ned, as he and Joe returned to the wreck of the cabin.  “No.”  “Well, if you haven't any money I'll do what I can for you.”  “Thank you, Ned; you are very kind.”  “It must be hard to be thrown out on the world in this fashion,” went on the rich boy, sympathetically.  “It is hard. After all, I thought a good deal of Uncle Hiram. He was strange in his ways, but he had a good heart.”  “Wasn't he shot in the head once by accident in the woods?”  “Yes.”  “Maybe that made him queer at times.”  “Perhaps so.”  “I've got six dollars and a half of my spending money saved up. You may have that if you wish,” continued Ned, generously.  “I'd rather not take it, Ned.”  “Why not?”  “If I can, I want to be independent. Besides, I think there is money around somewhere,” and Joe mentioned the missing blue box.  “You must hunt for that blue box by all means!” cried the rich boy. “I'll help you.”  After the death of Hiram Bodley, Joe and two of the lake guides had managed to repair one room of the broken-down cabin, and from this the funeral had taken place.  The room contained a bed, a table, two benches and a few dishes and cooking utensils The floor was bare and the window was broken out. It was truly a most uninviting home.  “Of course you are not going to stay here, now you are alone?” said Ned, after a look around.  “I don't know where else to go, Ned.”  “Why not move into town!”  “Perhaps I will. But I want to find that blue box before I decide on anything.”  Without delay the two boys set to work among the ruins, looking into every hole and corner they could think of and locate. They pulled away heavy boards and logs, and Joe even got a spade and dug up the ground at certain points.  “It doesn't seem to be here,” said Ned, after an hour had passed.  “It must be here,” cried Joe.  “Perhaps it was buried under a tree.”  “That may be true. Anyway, I am certain it is somewhere"]]]
