A short hour saw the black mare tearing up the neatly raked gravel in front of the façade of the Court, and by the time the dog-cart had departed for the stables, the phaeton came up to the door, with one of the young ladies in the driving seat.  \"Well, this _is_ a nice pair of horses!\" said the damsel, who evidently was not unaccustomed to driving a pair, if not a more imposing team. \"Fast, so well matched and well mannered; it's a pleasure to drive them. And oh! what a lovely old hall--and such darling trees! How fortunate we were to pick up such a place! It's not too large: there's not much land, but it's a perfect gem in its way. I suppose we are to have the pictures of the ancestors, too?\"  \"We shall have that reflected glory,\" said the matron with a smile. \"Sir Roland would not sell them, but hoped we would give them house-room till he wanted them--which might not be for years and years.\"  \"So they will still look down upon us--or frown, as the case may be,\" said the younger girl. \"How savage I should be if I were an ancestor, and new people came to turn out my descendant!\"  \"We haven't turned him out. We only buy him out,\" said her mother, \"which is quite a different thing. It is the modern way of taking the baron's castle--without bloodshed and unpleasantness.\"  \"It is a great shame, all the same, that he should have to turn out,\" exclaimed the younger girl, indignantly. \"I am sure he is a nice fellow, which makes it all the worse, because--because----\"  \"Because every one says so,\" continued her elder sister; \"as if that was a reason!\"  \"No! because he has _such good horses_. When a man keeps them, in such buckle too, there can't be much wrong with him.\"  \"What _is_ the reason that he can't live in a place like this, I wonder?\" queried Miss Lexington in a musing tone. \"A bachelor, too! Men don't seem to know when they are well off. He ought to try a dry year on one of our Paroo runs, if he wants a change. That would take the nonsense out of him. Our vile sex at the bottom of it, I suppose!\"  \"I _did_ catch a whisper in London, before we left,\" said Miss Violet, cautiously.  \"You always do,\" interrupted her sister. \"I hope you don't talk to Pinson confidentially. What was it?\"  \"Only that a girl that every one seemed to know about wouldn't have him, and that he nearly went out of his mind about it: wouldn't hear of living in England afterwards.\"  \"Poor fellow! he'll know better some day--won't he, mother? He must be a romantic person to go mooning about, wanting to die or emigrate, for a trifle like that.\"  \"I sometimes wonder if you girls of the present day have hearts, from the way you talk,\" mused the matron. \"However, I suppose they're deeper down than ours used to be. But I don't like my girls to sneer at true love. It's a sacred and holy thing, without which we women would have a sad time in this world. But, in our own country, men have done rash things in the agony of disappointment. You have heard of young Anstruther?\"  \"Oh yes, long ago. He went home and shot himself because of a silly girl. I suppose he's sorry for it now.\"  \"Hearts are much the same, in all countries and ages, depend upon it, my dears; they make people do strange things. But let us hope that there will be no unruly promptings in this family.\"  \"Quite so, mother--same here; but I suppose, as Longfellow tells us, 'as long as the heart has woes,' all sorts of droll things will happen. And now suppose we go and look at the stables before afternoon tea; I want to see the hunters and polo ponies. The garden we can see tomorrow morning.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Sir Roland, having made final arrangements, concluded to run down to Massinger for farewell purposes, he declined courteously Mr. Lexington's invitation to stay with him, and took up his abode at the Massinger Arms, in the village, where he considered he would be quiet and more independent. He felt himself obliged to say farewell to the people he had known all his life, small and great. But he never had less inclination for conversation and the ordinary society business. A week at the outside would suffice for such leave-taking as he considered obligatory.  As to the emigration matter which had so disturbed his _monde_, another factor of controlling power entered into the calculation. A re-valuation of his property made it apparent that when every liability came to be paid off, the available residue would be much less than he or his men of business reckoned on. Not more, indeed, than the ridiculously small sum of thirty or forty thousand pounds. He was not going to live on the Continent, or any cheap foreign place, on this. Nor to angle for an heiress. So, having been informed that he could live like a millionaire in the colonies, and probably make a fortune out of a grazing estate which half the money would purchase, there was nothing to keep him in England. Such considerations, reinforced by the haunting memories of a \"lost Lenore\" in the guise of Hypatia, drove him forward on his course _outre mer_ with such feverish force that he could scarcely bear to await the day of embarkation.     CHAPTER III   He could not well refuse an invitation to dinner from his successor, who called upon him, in form, the day after his arrival, and again begged him to make the old hall his home until he left England.  This request he begged to decline, much to Mr. Lexington's disappointment, though he agreed to dine.  \"My people were looking forward to having your advice upon all sorts of matters, which, of course, you would know about better than any one else. We are not going to make any great changes that I know of,\" said Mr. Lexington. \"Everything on the estate is in excellent order; your overseer--I mean bailiff--seems sensible and experienced. I shall give him his own way chiefly. He knows the place and the people, which of course I don't. My children, being Australians, are fond of horses; they are so much pleased with your lot, that you may be sure of their being well treated--and pensioned, when their time comes. I never sold an old favourite in my life, and am not going to begin in England, though you can't turn out a horse here all the year round as you can in Australia. And now I'll say good afternoon. Sorry you can't stay with us. We shall see you at dinner--half-past seven; but come any time.\"  Upon which Mr. Lexington departed, leaving a pleasant impression with the former owner.  \"What mistaken prejudices English people have, for the most part!\" he thought. \"Sir Giles Weatherly, I heard, was raving at my want of loyalty to the landed interest because I had left an opening for some 'rough colonist' to break into our sacred county enclosure. This man is a thorough gentleman, liberal and right-feeling; besides, with pots of money too, he will be able to do far more for the neighbourhood than would ever have been in my power. I shouldn't be surprised if the county considers him an improvement upon an impoverished family like ours before many months are past.\"  With a half-sigh, involuntary, but not without a distinct feeling of regret, as he thought how soon his place would be filled up, and how different a position would have been his had one woman's answer been otherwise, he addressed himself once more to the momentous question of emigration. He had purchased a quantity of colonial literature, and had made some headway through the handbooks thoughtfully provided for the roving Englishman of the period. The difficulty lay in deciding between the different offshoots of Britain. All apparently possessed limitless areas of fertile land and rich pasturage, in addition to goldfields, coal-mines, opal and diamond deposits, silver and copper mines, the whole vast territory reposing in safety under the world-wide ægis of the British flag.  Before he had found anything like a solution of this pressing problem, the church clock suggested dressing. So, attiring himself suitably, he made his way to the Court. He rang the hall-door bell somewhat impatiently, having only partially got over the feeling of strangeness at being invited to dinner at his own house, so to speak, and being shown into the drawing-room by his own butler. This official's gravity relaxed suddenly, after a vain struggle, and ended in a gasping \"Oh, Sir Roland!\" as he announced him in due form.  In the drawing-room, where nothing had been added or altered, he found three ladies, the son of the house, and his host. \"Mrs. Lexington, Miss Lexington, and my daughter Violet, with my son Frank,\" comprehended the introductions.  All were in evening attire, the ladies very quietly but becomingly dressed. The dinner was much as usual; his own wines, glass, and table decorations were in the same order as before. Could he have given a dinner-party unawares? His position at the right hand of Mrs. Lexington seemed hardly to decide the question.  No reference was made by any of the company, which included the rector of the parish (a few minutes late), to his reasons for expatriating himself, though expressions of regret occurred that he should be leaving the country.  \"My daughters are lost in astonishment that you should voluntarily quit such a paradise, as it appears to us sunburnt Australians,\" said the lady of the house.  \"You wouldn't have got _me_ to leave it without a fight,\" said Miss Lexington; \"but I suppose men get tired of comfort in this dear old country, where everything goes on by itself apparently, and even the servants seem 'laid on' like the gas and water. They must want danger and discomfort as a change.\"  \"There would not appear to have been much in the country from which you came,\" replied Sir Roland, declining the personal question.  \"We have had our share,\" said Mr. Lexington. \"Fortunately one is seldom the worse for it; perhaps the more fitted to enjoy life's luxuries, when they come in their turn. Tell Sir Roland something, Frank, about that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53358"],["title","\"War to the Knife;\" or, Tangata Maori (#7)"],["body","season when you were travelling with the 'Diamond D' cattle.\"  \"Rather early in the evening for Queensland stories, isn't it?\" replied the younger man thus invoked, who did not, except in a deeper tint of bronze, present any point of departure from the home-grown product. \"Tell him one or two after dinner. I'd rather have his advice about the country sport, if he'll be good enough to enlighten me.\"  \"A better guide than my old friend the rector here the country doesn't hold,\" said the ex-squire. \"He knows to a day when 'cock' may be expected, and though he doesn't hunt now, he used to be in the first flight; as for fishing, he's Izaak Walton's sworn disciple. I leave you in good hands. All the same, I'm ready to be of use in any way.\"  \"The weather feels warm now, even to us. We hardly expected such a day,\" remarked Mrs. Lexington; \"and as we have none of us been home before, we don't quite know what to make of it.\"  \"If it's a trifle warm and close, it never lasts more than a few days, they tell me,\" said the eldest daughter; \"and the nights are always cool. That's one comfort. I always feel like putting a new line in my prayers of thankfulness for there being hardly any flies and no mosquitoes. And such lovely fresh mornings to wake up in! Such trees, such grass! No wonder the hymns speak of 'a happy English child!'\"  \"All the same, Australia is not a bad country,\" said Mrs. Lexington, \"though we did have seventeen days once at the Macquarie River when it was a hundred in the shade every day and ninety every night. On the other hand, the Riverina winter was superb--such cloudless days and merely bracing mornings and evenings. I dare say we shall miss _them_ here in 'chill October.' Sir Roland will give us his impressions when he returns, perhaps,\" she continued. \"It is hard to find a climate which is pleasant all the year round. A cool summer is enjoyed at the expense of a cold winter. And we have extremes even in Australia. I saw in the paper lately some account of pedestrians being thirty hours in snow, and much exhausted when they reached their destination after being out all night.\"  \"I should hardly have thought that possible,\" said the guest, genuinely astonished.  \"English people hear more of the heat of our climate than the cold,\" said his host, good-humouredly; \"but the mails are carried on snow-shoes in the winter season of a town I know, and I have seen the children going to school in them too.\"  \"Oh, come! dad will soon begin to tell stories about snakes,\" said Miss Violet, \"if we don't turn the conversation. Do you have much lawn tennis in the neighbourhood, Sir Roland?\"  \"A good deal,\" he replied, \"as the rector will tell you. His daughters are great performers, and at the last tournament with West Essex Miss Charlton was the champion.\"  \"Oh, how delightful! We all play except dad and mother, so we shall be able to keep up our form.\"  \"Then it's not too hot in the Australian summer for exercise?\"  \"It's never too hot for cricket, or dancing, or tennis in our country. We couldn't do without them, so the weather must take its chance. After all, a little heat, more or less, doesn't seem to matter.\"  \"Apparently not,\" said Sir Roland, noting the girl's well-developed figure, regular features, and animated expression.  In truth, they were both handsome girls, though their complexions showed a clear but healthy pallor, as distinguished from the rose-bloom of their British sisters. If Sir Roland had not been dead to all sympathetic consideration of the great world of woman, it would have occurred to him that a man might \"go farther and fare worse\" than by choosing either of these frank, unspoiled maidens, rich in the possession of the charm of youth and the crowning glory of the sex--the tender, faithful heart of a true woman.  But to his dulled and disturbed senses, not as yet recovered from the merciless blow dealt him by fate, no such appreciation of their youthful graces was possible.  He was courteous to the utmost point of politeness, scrupulously attentive to their queries about this, to them, unfamiliar land of their forefathers; careful also to requite the consideration with which he felt they had regarded him. But they might have been any one's maiden aunts, or indeed grandmothers, for all the personal interest which he felt in them. Indeed, when Mrs. Lexington caught her eldest daughter's eye and proceeded to the drawing-room, he was distinctly conscious of a feeling of relief.  Then, as he drew up his chair at the suggestion of his host, he began to show increased interest, as the question of a desirable colony to betake himself to was mooted.  \"You are not in the same position as many young men whom Frank and I have met. You are accustomed to a country life, and have a practical knowledge of farming. Your cattle and sheep (we went through them this morning) do the management credit, and the bailiff tells me that you directed it in a general way. The crops and the grass lands are A 1. So you won't have so much to learn when you've thought out the climate in Australia. May I consider that you prefer agriculture to a pastoral life?\"  \"I must say that I do, though I don't limit myself to any particular pursuit or investment. I should feel grateful for your advice in the matter.\"  \"We are all New South Wales people, born there indeed, and probably prejudiced in its favour. It is the mother colony of Australia, and until lately the largest, so that there was always plenty of scope. We have never, like most of the larger pastoralists, had much to do with farming, preferring to buy our hay, corn, flour, and such trifles from the small settlers.\"  \"The squatters, as I suppose they are called,\" interposed Massinger, who was beginning to be proud of his colonial knowledge.  \"Well, not exactly,\" corrected the colonist. \"The smaller holders are called farmers, or 'free-selectors,' having by a late Act of Parliament acquired the right of free choice over the Crown lands leased in vast acres to the squatters. They follow farming exclusively as an occupation, and are chiefly tenants, or men of small capital. The squatter, on the other hand, is the Australian country gentleman--the landlord, where he is a free holder. It is therefore the more fashionable pursuit, so to speak, and as such, has proved attractive to men like yourself, who commence colonial life with a fair amount of capital. Perhaps Frank will give you his views.\"  \"I never could stand farming at any price,\" said the younger colonist. \"I hardly know a turnip from a potato. My fancy has always been for the big outside stations. There's something to stir a man's blood in managing a property fifty miles square, with plain, forest, and river to match. Then twenty thousand head of cattle, or a hundred thousand sheep to organize a commissariat for, and an army of men to command! There's no time to potter about ploughing and harrowing, haymaking or reaping, in country like that. You might as well dig your own garden.\"  \"But surely they are necessary occupations?\" queried the intending colonist.  \"Not to men with a million of acres or so in hand. They can't worry over details. We buy everything we want in that way, and have it brought to our doors, more cheaply than we could grow it. Our work in life, so far, is to produce cheap beef, mutton, and wool, to feed your people and for them to manufacture. That, I take it, is our present business, and anything that interferes with it is a loss to the empire.\"  \"That seems a short list of products for a great country like yours. Couldn't you supply anything more from the land?\"  \"All in good time,\" said the young man, sipping his claret. \"By-and-by, when labour becomes more plentiful and the population denser, we shall send you butter and bacon, cheese, honey, fruit, flour, sugar, wine, and oil--even rabbits, confound them!--by the million. These products, when we have time, and have overtaken the local demand, we can export by the shipload. A hundred thousand frozen lambs--that kind of thing--in one steamer.\"  \"But you have said nothing about horses. Surely I have heard that your country is very suitable for rearing them?\" asked their guest.  \"Suitable!\" ejaculated the young Australian, with more animation than he had previously expressed. \"I should think so. Yet up to this day, though a fascinating pursuit, horses haven't paid so well as sheep and cattle. But our time is coming. I have always maintained that we could breed cavalry and artillery horses for all Europe--more cheaply, too, than any other country in the world; horses possessing extraordinary courage, stoutness, speed, and constitution. From the way in which they are reared on the natural grasses in the open air, they have the best feet and legs in the world. The Indian buyers find them more suitable for cavalry and artillery than Arabs or their own stud-breds, but as yet they only take a tenth part of what we could rear if the markets were more steady and assured. It will be proved some day that the English horse gains in stoutness in Australia after a generation, and I look forward even to our sending you back pure Australian thoroughbreds, equal in speed to their imported grandsires, but sounder, stronger in constitution, and with more bone.\"  As the descendant of Kentish squires spoke with heightened feeling upon what was evidently a favourite theme, Massinger could not help admitting that the speaker himself was no bad exemplar of the favourable conditions of a free, adventurous, roving life upon the Anglo-Saxon type. Frank Lexington was, indeed, as fine a man as you could make physically--a description once applied to him by an enthusiastic admirer at an up-country race meeting. Standing somewhat over six feet in height, he was admirably proportioned, and not less for strength than activity. His features were regular, approaching the Greek ideal in outline, while his steady eye and square jaw denoted the courage and decision which,"]]]
