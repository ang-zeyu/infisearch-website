He tasted the corn and the clear water again.  He admired his image in the river, and longed for the sound of his voice, until he began murmuring, \"Wheat! Wheat! Wheat!\" in his sleep.  In the earliest dawn a robin awoke him singing, \"Cheer up! Cheer up!\" and he answered with a sleepy \"Cheer! Cheer! Cheer!\"  Later the robin sang again with exquisite softness and tenderness: \"Cheer up, Dearie!  Cheer up, Dearie! Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer!\"  The Cardinal, now fully awakened, shouted lustily, \"Good Cheer! Good Cheer!\"  and after that it was only a short time until he was on his way toward the shining river.  It was better than before, and every following day found him feasting in the corn field and bathing in the shining water; but he always returned to his family at nightfall.  When black frosts began to strip the Limberlost, and food was almost reduced to dry seed, there came a day on which the king marshalled his followers and gave the magic signal.  With dusk he led them southward, mile after mile, until their breath fell short, and their wings ached with unaccustomed flight; but because of the trips to the river, the Cardinal was stronger than the others, and he easily kept abreast of the king.  In the early morning, even before the robins were awake, the king settled in the Everglades.  But the Cardinal had lost all liking for swamp life, so he stubbornly set out alone, and in a short time he had found another river.  It was not quite so delightful as the shining river; but still it was beautiful, and on its gently sloping bank was an orange orchard.  There the Cardinal rested, and found a winter home after his heart's desire.  The following morning, a golden-haired little girl and an old man with snowy locks came hand in hand through the orchard.  The child saw the redbird and immediately claimed him, and that same day the edict went forth that a very dreadful time was in store for any one who harmed or even frightened the Cardinal.  So in security began a series of days that were pure delight.  The orchard was alive with insects, attracted by the heavy odours, and slugs infested the bark.  Feasting was almost as good as in the Limberlost, and always there was the river to drink from and to splash in at will.  In those days the child and the old man lingered for hours in the orchard, watching the bird that every day seemed to grow bigger and brighter.  What a picture his coat, now a bright cardinal red, made against the waxy green leaves!  How big and brilliant he seemed as he raced and darted in play among the creamy blossoms!  How the little girl stood with clasped hands worshipping him, as with swelling throat he rocked on the highest spray and sang his inspiring chorus over and over: \"Good Cheer!  Good Cheer!\"  Every day they came to watch and listen.  They scattered crumbs; and the Cardinal grew so friendly that he greeted their coming with a quick \"Chip! Chip!\" while the delighted child tried to repeat it after him.  Soon they became such friends that when he saw them approaching he would call softly \"Chip! Chip!\" and then with beady eyes and tilted head await her reply.  Sometimes a member of his family from the Everglades found his way into the orchard, and the Cardinal, having grown to feel a sense of proprietorship, resented the intrusion and pursued him like a streak of flame.  Whenever any straggler had this experience, he returned to the swamp realizing that the Cardinal of the orange orchard was almost twice his size and strength, and so startlingly red as to be a wonder.  One day a gentle breeze from the north sprang up and stirred the orange branches, wafting the heavy perfume across the land and out to sea, and spread in its stead a cool, delicate, pungent odour.  The Cardinal lifted his head and whistled an inquiring note.  He was not certain, and went on searching for slugs, and predicting happiness in full round notes: \"Good Cheer! Good Cheer!\"  Again the odour swept the orchard, so strong that this time there was no mistaking it.  The Cardinal darted to the topmost branch, his crest flaring, his tail twitching nervously. \"Chip! Chip!\" he cried with excited insistence, \"Chip! Chip!\"  The breeze was coming stiffly and steadily now, unlike anything the Cardinal ever had known, for its cool breath told of ice-bound fields breaking up under the sun.  Its damp touch was from the spring showers washing the face of the northland.  Its subtle odour was the commingling of myriads of unfolding leaves and crisp plants, upspringing; its pungent perfume was the pollen of catkins.  Up in the land of the Limberlost, old Mother Nature, with strident muttering, had set about her annual house cleaning.  With her efficient broom, the March wind, she was sweeping every nook and cranny clean. With her scrub-bucket overflowing with April showers, she was washing the face of all creation, and if these measures failed to produce cleanliness to her satisfaction, she gave a final polish with storms of hail.  The shining river was filled to overflowing; breaking up the ice and carrying a load of refuse, it went rolling to the sea.  The ice and snow had not altogether gone; but the long-pregnant earth was mothering her children.  She cringed at every step, for the ground was teeming with life.  Bug and worm were working to light and warmth. Thrusting aside the mold and leaves above them, spring beauties, hepaticas, and violets lifted tender golden-green heads.  The sap was flowing, and leafless trees were covered with swelling buds. Delicate mosses were creeping over every stick of decaying timber.  The lichens on stone and fence were freshly painted in unending shades of gray and green. Myriads of flowers and vines were springing up to cover last year's decaying leaves.  \"The beautiful uncut hair of graves\" was creeping over meadow, spreading beside roadways, and blanketing every naked spot.  The Limberlost was waking to life even ahead of the fields and the river.  Through the winter it had been the barest and dreariest of places; but now the earliest signs of returning spring were in its martial music, for when the green hyla pipes, and the bullfrog drums, the bird voices soon join them.  The catkins bloomed first; and then, in an incredibly short time, flags, rushes, and vines were like a sea of waving green, and swelling buds were ready to burst.  In the upland the smoke was curling over sugar-camp and clearing; in the forests animals were rousing from their long sleep; the shad were starting anew their never-ending journey up the shining river; peeps of green were mantling hilltop and valley; and the northland was ready for its dearest springtime treasures to come home again.  From overhead were ringing those first glad notes, caught nearer the Throne than those of any other bird, \"Spring o' year! Spring o' year!\"; while stilt-legged little killdeers were scudding around the Limberlost and beside the river, flinging from cloudland their \"Kill deer! Kill deer!\" call.  The robins in the orchards were pulling the long dried blades of last year's grass from beneath the snow to line their mud-walled cups; and the bluebirds were at the hollow apple tree.  Flat on the top rail, the doves were gathering their few coarse sticks and twigs together.  It was such a splendid place to set their cradle.  The weatherbeaten, rotting old rails were the very colour of the busy dove mother.  Her red-rimmed eye fitted into the background like a tiny scarlet lichen cup.  Surely no one would ever see her!  The Limberlost and shining river, the fields and forests, the wayside bushes and fences, the stumps, logs, hollow trees, even the bare brown breast of Mother Earth, were all waiting to cradle their own again; and by one of the untold miracles each would return to its place.  There was intoxication in the air.  The subtle, pungent, ravishing odours on the wind, of unfolding leaves, ice-water washed plants, and catkin pollen, were an elixir to humanity.  The cattle of the field were fairly drunk with it, and herds, dry-fed during the winter, were coming to their first grazing with heads thrown high, romping, bellowing, and racing like wild things.  The north wind, sweeping from icy fastnesses, caught this odour of spring, and carried it to the orange orchards and Everglades; and at a breath of it, crazed with excitement, the Cardinal went flaming through the orchard, for with no one to teach him, he knew what it meant.  The call had come.  Holidays were over.  It was time to go home, time to riot in crisp freshness, time to go courting, time to make love, time to possess his own, time for mating and nest-building.  All that day he flashed around, nervous with dread of the unknown, and palpitant with delightful expectation; but with the coming of dusk he began his journey northward.  When he passed the Everglades, he winged his way slowly, and repeatedly sent down a challenging \"Chip,\" but there was no answer.  Then the Cardinal knew that the north wind had carried a true message, for the king and his followers were ahead of him on their way to the Limberlost.  Mile after mile, a thing of pulsing fire, he breasted the blue-black night, and it was not so very long until he could discern a flickering patch of darkness sweeping the sky before him.  The Cardinal flew steadily in a straight sweep, until with a throb of triumph in his heart, he arose in his course, and from far overhead, flung down a boastful challenge to the king and his followers, as he sailed above them and was lost from sight.  It was still dusky with the darkness of night when he crossed the Limberlost, dropping low enough to see its branches laid bare, to catch a gleam of green in its swelling buds, and to hear the wavering chorus of its frogs.  But there was no hesitation in his flight.  Straight and sure he winged his way toward the shining river; and it was only a few more miles until the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],["title","The Song of the Cardinal (#3)"],["body","waters of its springtime flood caught his eye.  Dropping precipitately, he plunged his burning beak into the loved water; then he flew into a fine old stag sumac and tucked his head under his wing for a short rest.  He had made the long flight in one unbroken sweep, and he was sleepy.  In utter content he ruffled his feathers and closed his eyes, for he was beside the shining river; and it would be another season before the orange orchard would ring again with his \"Good Cheer! Good Cheer!\"    Chapter 2  \"Wet year! Wet year!\" prophesied the Cardinal   The sumac seemed to fill his idea of a perfect location from the very first.  He perched on a limb, and between dressing his plumage and pecking at last year's sour dried berries, he sent abroad his prediction.  Old Mother Nature verified his wisdom by sending a dashing shower, but he cared not at all for a wetting.  He knew how to turn his crimson suit into the most perfect of water-proof coats; so he flattened his crest, sleeked his feathers, and breasting the April downpour, kept on calling for rain.  He knew he would appear brighter when it was past, and he seemed to know, too, that every day of sunshine and shower would bring nearer his heart's desire.  He was a very Beau Brummel while he waited.  From morning until night he bathed, dressed his feathers, sunned himself, fluffed and flirted. He strutted and \"chipped\" incessantly.  He claimed that sumac for his very own, and stoutly battled for possession with many intruders.  It grew on a densely wooded slope, and the shining river went singing between grassy banks, whitened with spring beauties, below it.  Crowded around it were thickets of papaw, wild grape-vines, thorn, dogwood, and red haw, that attracted bug and insect; and just across the old snake fence was a field of mellow mould sloping to the river, that soon would be plowed for corn, turning out numberless big fat grubs.  He was compelled almost hourly to wage battles for his location, for there was something fine about the old stag sumac that attracted homestead seekers.  A sober pair of robins began laying their foundations there the morning the Cardinal arrived, and a couple of blackbirds tried to take possession before the day had passed.  He had little trouble with the robins.  They were easily conquered, and with small protest settled a rod up the bank in a wild-plum tree; but the air was thick with \"chips,\" chatter, and red and black feathers, before the blackbirds acknowledged defeat.  They were old-timers, and knew about the grubs and the young corn; but they also knew when they were beaten, so they moved down stream to a scrub oak, trying to assure each other that it was the place they really had wanted from the first.  The Cardinal was left boasting and strutting in the sumac, but in his heart he found it lonesome business.  Being the son of a king, he was much too dignified to beg for a mate, and besides, it took all his time to guard the sumac; but his eyes were wide open to all that went on around him, and he envied the blackbird his glossy, devoted little sweetheart, with all his might.  He almost strained his voice trying to rival the love-song of a skylark that hung among the clouds above a meadow across the river, and poured down to his mate a story of adoring love and sympathy.  He screamed a \"Chip\" of such savage jealousy at a pair of killdeer lovers that he sent them scampering down the river bank without knowing that the crime of which they stood convicted was that of being mated when he was not.  As for the doves that were already brooding on the line fence beneath the maples, the Cardinal was torn between two opinions.  He was alone, he was love-sick, and he was holding the finest building location beside the shining river for his mate, and her slowness in coming made their devotion difficult to endure when he coveted a true love; but it seemed to the Cardinal that he never could so forget himself as to emulate the example of that dove lover.  The dove had no dignity; he was so effusive he was a nuisance.  He kept his dignified Quaker mate stuffed to discomfort; he clung to the side of the nest trying to help brood until he almost crowded her from the eggs.  He pestered her with caresses and cooed over his love-song until every chipmunk on the line fence was familiar with his story.  The Cardinal's temper was worn to such a fine edge that he darted at the dove one day and pulled a big tuft of feathers from his back.  When he had returned to the sumac, he was compelled to admit that his anger lay quite as much in that he had no one to love as because the dove was disgustingly devoted.  Every morning brought new arrivals--trim young females fresh from their long holiday, and big boastful males appearing their brightest and bravest, each singer almost splitting his throat in the effort to captivate the mate he coveted.  They came flashing down the river bank, like rockets of scarlet, gold, blue, and black; rocking on the willows, splashing in the water, bursting into jets of melody, making every possible display of their beauty and music; and at times fighting fiercely when they discovered that the females they were wooing favoured their rivals and desired only to be friendly with them.  The heart of the Cardinal sank as he watched.  There was not a member of his immediate family among them.  He pitied himself as he wondered if fate had in store for him the trials he saw others suffering.  Those dreadful feathered females! How they coquetted!  How they flirted! How they sleeked and flattened their plumage, and with half-open beaks and sparkling eyes, hopped closer and closer as if charmed.  The eager singers, with swelling throats, sang and sang in a very frenzy of extravagant pleading, but just when they felt sure their little loves were on the point of surrender, a rod distant above the bushes would go streaks of feathers, and there was nothing left but to endure the bitter disappointment, follow them, and begin all over.  For the last three days the Cardinal had been watching his cousin, rose-breasted Grosbeak, make violent love to the most exquisite little female, who apparently encouraged his advances, only to see him left sitting as blue and disconsolate as any human lover, when he discovers that the maid who has coquetted with him for a season belongs to another man.  The Cardinal flew to the very top of the highest sycamore and looked across country toward the Limberlost.  Should he go there seeking a swamp mate among his kindred?  It was not an endurable thought.  To be sure, matters were becoming serious.  No bird beside the shining river had plumed, paraded, or made more music than he.  Was it all to be wasted?  By this time he confidently had expected results.  Only that morning he had swelled with pride as he heard Mrs. Jay tell her quarrelsome husband that she wished she could exchange him for the Cardinal.  Did not the gentle dove pause by the sumac, when she left brooding to take her morning dip in the dust, and gaze at him with unconcealed admiration?  No doubt she devoutly wished her plain pudgy husband wore a scarlet coat.  But it is praise from one's own sex that is praise indeed, and only an hour ago the lark had reported that from his lookout above cloud he saw no other singer anywhere so splendid as the Cardinal of the sumac.  Because of these things he held fast to his conviction that he was a prince indeed; and he decided to remain in his chosen location and with his physical and vocal attractions compel the finest little cardinal in the fields to seek him.  He planned it all very carefully: how she would hear his splendid music and come to take a peep at him; how she would be captivated by his size and beauty; how she would come timidly, but come, of course, for his approval; how he would condescend to accept her if she pleased him in all particulars; how she would be devoted to him; and how she would approve his choice of a home, for the sumac was in a lovely spot for scenery, as well as nest-building.  For several days he had boasted, he had bantered, he had challenged, he had on this last day almost condescended to coaxing, but not one little bright-eyed cardinal female had come to offer herself.  The performance of a brown thrush drove him wild with envy.  The thrush came gliding up the river bank, a rusty-coated, sneaking thing of the underbrush, and taking possession of a thorn bush just opposite the sumac, he sang for an hour in the open.  There was no way to improve that music.  It was woven fresh from the warp and woof of his fancy. It was a song so filled with the joy and gladness of spring, notes so thrilled with love's pleading and passion's tender pulsing pain, that at its close there were a half-dozen admiring thrush females gathered around.  With care and deliberation the brown thrush selected the most attractive, and she followed him to the thicket as if charmed.  It was the Cardinal's dream materialized for another before his very eyes, and it filled him with envy.  If that plain brown bird that slinked as if he had a theft to account for, could, by showing himself and singing for an hour, win a mate, why should not he, the most gorgeous bird of the woods, openly flaunting his charms and discoursing his music, have at least equal success?  Should he, the proudest, most magnificent of cardinals, be compelled to go seeking a mate like any common bird?  Perish the thought!  He went to the river to bathe.  After finding a spot where the water flowed crystal-clear over a bed of white limestone, he washed until he felt that he could be no cleaner.  Then the Cardinal went to his favourite sun-parlour, and stretching on a limb, he stood his feathers on end, and sunned, fluffed and prinked until he was immaculate.  On the tip-top antler of the old stag sumac, he perched and strained until his jetty whiskers appeared stubby.  He poured out a tumultuous cry vibrant with every passion raging "]]]
