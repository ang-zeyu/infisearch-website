He was received, however, by the church and baptized by the pastor with some fears and doubts upon his mind. Very soon, Diotrephes-like, he began to put himself forward and seek pre-eminence, and was well-nigh supplanting the tried and faithful minister who had reared and nursed and led the church for a long series of years. So thoroughly convinced was Father Phillips by this time that he was not possessed of the spirit of Christ, notwithstanding his miraculous conversion and flippant speech, that he declared his belief 'that as long as he [Sidney Rigdon] should live, he would be a curse to the church of Christ.'\" [68]  [Footnote 68: \"Mormonism Exposed,\" by Williams, copied in \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" page 13.]  Concerning Rigdon's expulsion or resignation from the Baptist Church, the Mormons declare that it was caused by Rigdon's refusal to either accept or teach the doctrine of infant damnation. Dr. Winter, in the course of a historical notice of the First Baptist Church of Pittsburg, says: \"When Holland Sumner dealt with Rigdon for his bad teachings, and said to him: 'Brother Rigdon, you never got into a Baptist church without relating your Christian experiences,' Rigdon replied: 'When I joined the church at Peter's Creek I knew I could not be admitted without an experience, so I made up one to suit the purpose; but it was all made up and was of no use, nor true.' This I have just copied from an old memorandum as taken from Sumner himself.\" [69]  [Footnote 69: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 13. _Baptist Witness_ (Pittsburg), January 1, 1875.]  The first of these accounts was published in 1842, the last in January, 1875, and Rigdon lived until July 14, 1876. While one H. A. Dunlavy of Lebanon, O., did, in the March number of the same paper, publish an apology for Rigdon by way of answer to the article of Dr. Winter, yet neither Dunlavy nor Rigdon ever denied the facts alleged therein. We must, therefore, accept the facts stated as true, and they fasten upon Rigdon such religious dishonesty as establishes his willingness to be a party to a religious fraud in kind like the one here charged against him.  This, then, brings us to the question of what, if any, opportunity Rigdon had for stealing Spaulding's manuscript from Patterson's publishing office.  RIGDON HAD OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THE MANUSCRIPT.  It has been frequently charged that Sidney Rigdon lived in Pittsburg and was connected with the Patterson printing office during 1815 and 1816. To this charge Rigdon, under date Commerce (Ill.), May 27, 1839, makes the following denial:      \"It is only necessary to say in relation to the whole story about     Spaulding's writings being in the hands of Mr. Patterson, who was     then in Pittsburg, and who is said to have kept a private printing     office, and my saying that I was connected with the same office,     etc., etc., is the most base of lies, without even the shadow     of truth. There was no man by the name of Patterson during my     residence in Pittsburg who had a printing office; what might have     been before I lived here, I know not. Mr. Robert Patterson, I was     told, had owned a printing office before I lived in that city, but     had been unfortunate in business and failed before my residence in     Pittsburg. This Mr. Patterson, who was a Presbyterian preacher,     I had a very slight acquaintance with during my residence there.     He was then acting under an agency in the book and stationery     business, and was the owner of no property of any kind, printing     office, or anything else during the time I resided in that city. If     I were to say that I ever heard of the Rev. Solomon Spaulding and     his hopeful wife until Dr. P. Hurlburt wrote his lie about me, I     should be a liar like unto themselves.\" [70]  [Footnote 70: \"Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" 11 and 12. \"History of the Mormons,\" 45 and 46. \"The Mormons,\" 34. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 94. \"Plain Facts Showing the Falsehood and Folly of the Rev. C.S. Bush,\" p. 14 to 16.]  The evidence upon which is based the charge of Rigdon having a permanent residence in Pittsburg during the years in question, or his connection with Patterson's printing office, is so unsatisfactory that these issues must be found in favor of Rigdon's denial, even in spite of the fact that his evidence is discredited by reason of the conclusion as to his guilt, which is to be hereafter set forth, and his personal interest.  Rigdon, it will be remembered, lived within from six to ten miles of Pittsburg during the years in question. Pittsburg was the only town of consequence, and the family's place of buying and selling. Rigdon would of necessity make many friends in the city, and it would not be strange if almost everybody knew him and he knew all of the prominent citizens. In 1810 Pittsburg had only about 4,000 inhabitants, and in 1820 had but 7,248.  The very prevalent notion as to Rigdon's connection with the Patterson publishing establishment must have had some origin, which, in all probability, would be Rigdon's close friendship for some who were, in fact, connected with it. Upon this theory only can we account for such a general impression. [71]  [Footnote 71: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 11.]  It might be well, before entering upon that subject, to fix in our minds Patterson's business mutations. In 1812 Patterson was in the book business in the firm of Patterson and Hopkins. They had then in their employ one J. Harrison Lambdin, he being a lad of fourteen. January 1, 1818, Lambdin was taken into the partnership of Patterson and Lambdin, which firm succeeded R. and J. Patterson. R. Patterson had in his employ one Silas Engles as foreman printer and superintendent of the printing business. As such, the latter decided upon the propriety, or otherwise, of publishing manuscripts when offered. The partnership of Patterson and Lambdin \"had under its control the book store on Fourth Street, a book bindery, a printing office (not newspaper, but job office, under the name of Buttler and Lambdin), entrance on Diamond Alley, and a steam paper mill on the Allegheny (under the name of R. and J. Patterson).\" [72] Patterson and Lambdin continued in business until 1823. Lambdin died August 1, 1825, in his twenty-seventh year. Silas Engles died July 17, 1827, in his forty-sixth year. R. Patterson died September 5, 1854, in his eighty-second year. [73]  [Footnote 72: \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 26. \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 9.]  [Footnote 73: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 7 and 9. This covers all Patterson's migrations.]  RIGDON'S ONLY DENIAL ANALYZED.  Let us now analyze Mr. Rigdon's denial of 1839 as quoted above. Rigdon was an educated man, a controversialist in religion, and at the date of the denial he was also a lawyer. Therefore we are justified in holding him in a strict accountability for all that is necessarily implied from what he says or omits to say, as we could not, in justice, do with a layman.  Rigdon's first denial is of the \"Story about Spaulding's writing being in the hands of Patterson.\" This story is established by the evidence already adduced and some besides, even to the satisfaction of most Mormons.  The negative of this proposition Mr. Rigdon, if he was a stranger to the office, as is claimed, could not possibly assert as a matter within his own knowledge. If Rigdon had in his mind any fact upon which he justified this assertion, it could only have been a knowledge that the manuscript was at the printing office of Buttler and Lambdin, not knowing that that office was controlled by Patterson.  The second denial in Rigdon's statement is: \"There was no man by the name of Patterson during my residence in Pittsburg who had a printing office.\" The foregoing account of Patterson's business affairs is made up from the information possessed by Patterson's family and an employee. It must, therefore, be accepted as correct. Here again Rigdon's denial can be accounted for by assuming his ignorance of Patterson's interest in the printing office known as Buttler and Lambdin. Rigdon's son says Rigdon lived in Pittsburg in 1818. Church biographers allege that he preached there regularly after January 28, 1822. During 1818 and 1822 Patterson was in the printing business, and Rigdon's statement must be deemed untrue.  Howe, in his \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" [74] did, as early as 1834, charge that Rigdon had been \"on intimate terms\" with Lambdin. This statement in many forms has been very often republished since, and between 1834 and 1876, the year of Rigdon's death. During these forty-two years Rigdon never recorded a denial. That fact may, therefore, be taken as true. If Rigdon was on terms of intimacy with Lambdin, and Lambdin, at the time of that intimacy, as is clearly established and undenied, was connected with Patterson in the publishing business, Rigdon, being intimate with him, must have known something of Patterson's business, and assuming his mental faculties unimpaired, he, in the statement under consideration, must have told what he knew was untrue, justifying himself by the apparent evidence in his favor that Patterson's printing office was not run in his own name.  [Footnote 74: p. 289]  Rigdon's third matter of denial relates to his own admission of a connection with Patterson's printing establishment. This denial we must accept as true, since no one to whom he is alleged to have made the admission has ever recorded his evidence, and the hearsay statements without certainty of origin are too indefinite to be entitled to weight.  This paragraph above quoted and thus analyzed absolutely denies nothing in the remotest degree essential to the real issues involved in the charge of plagiarism under investigation, and is absolutely the only recorded public denial ever made by Rigdon, though from 1834 to 1876 he was almost continually under the fire of this charge, reiterated in various forms and with varying"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],["title","Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#7)"],["body","roofs.  RIGDON AND LAMBDIN IN 1815.  Heretofore we have argued that by his silence Rigdon admitted his intimacy with Lambdin, successively Patterson's employee and partner from 1812 to 1823. The early writers all treated the intimacy between Rigdon and Lambdin as a matter apparently too well known to need proof. Yet we need not rely upon that, nor even Rigdon's failure to deny, since more definite evidence has been preserved.  Mrs. R. J. Eichbaum, under date of Pittsburg, September 18, 1879, leaves us this very convincing statement:      \"My father, John Johnston, was postmaster at Pittsburg for about     eighteen years, from 1804 to 1822. My husband, William Eichbaumn,     succeeded him, and was postmaster for about eleven years, from 1822     to 1833. I was born August 25, 1792, and when I became old enough     I assisted my father in attending to the post office, and became     familiar with his duties. From 1811 to 1816 I was the regular     clerk in the office, assorting, making up, dispatching, opening,     and distributing the mails. Pittsburg was then a small town, and I     was well acquainted with all the stated visitors at the office who     called regularly for their mails. So meager at that time were the     mails that I could generally tell without looking whether or not     there was anything for such persons, though I would usually look     in order to satisfy them. I was married in 1815, and the next year     my connection with the office ceased, except during the absences     of my husband. I knew and distinctly remember Robert and Joseph     Patterson, J. Harrison Lambdin, Silas Engles, and Sidney Rigdon.     I remember Rev. Mr. Spaulding, but simply as one who occasionally     called to inquire for letters. I remember there was an evident     intimacy between Lambdin and Rigdon. They very often came to the     office together. I particularly remember that they would thus come     during the hour on Sabbath afternoon when the office was required     to be open, and I remember feeling sure that Rev. Mr. Patterson     knew nothing of this, or he would have put a stop to it. I do not     know what position, if any, Rigdon filled in Patterson's store or     printing office, but am well assured he was frequently, if not     constantly, there for a large part of the time when I was clerk in     the post office. I recall Mr. Engles saying that 'Rigdon was always     hanging around the printing office.' He was connected with the     tannery before he became a preacher, though he may have continued     the business whilst preaching.\" [75]  [Footnote 75: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 10-11.]  While this does not establish that Sidney Rigdon had a permanent abode in Pittsburg, nor that he was connected with Patterson's printing establishment, it yet explains why seemingly everybody who knew him reached that conclusion. It also establishes beyond doubt his undeniable intimacy with Lambdin and Engles, and by reason thereof, his possible access to Spaulding's manuscript, and doubtless is one of the circumstances leading Spaulding to suspect Rigdon of the theft.  RIGDON EXHIBITS SPAULDING'S MANUSCRIPT.  It will be remembered that in 1822-3 Rigdon was a Baptist preacher in Pittsburg. The Rev. John Winter, M.D., one of the western Pennsylvania's early preachers, was then (1822-3) a school teacher in Pittsburg. Dr. Winter died at Sharon, Pa., in 1878.  On one occasion during this period (1822-3) Dr. Winter was in Rigdon's study when the latter took from his desk a large manuscript, and said, substantially, that a Presbyterian minister named Spaulding, whose health had failed, brought it to a printer to see if it would pay to publish it. \"It is a romance of the Bible.\" Dr. Winter did not read the manuscript, nor think any more of the matter until the Book of Mormon appeared. It was thought by members of Dr. Winter's family that he had committed his recollections of this interview to writing, but none could be found.  The authorities of Dr. Winter's statement are Rev. A. G. Kirk, to whom Dr. Winter communicated it in a conversation had at New Brighton, Pa., in 1870-1. The second authority is the Rev. A. J. Bonsall, a stepson of Dr. Winter, and for twenty-three years pastor of the Baptist Church at Rochester, Pa. To him the same story was often repeated by Dr. Winter. The third authority is Mrs. W. Irvine, a daughter of Dr. Winter, in 1881 resident at Sharon, Pa. Her statement has one or two details not already given, so I quote:      \"I have frequently heard my father speak of Rigdon having     Spaulding's manuscript, and that he had gotten it from the printers     to read it as a curiosity; as such he showed it to father; and that     at the time Rigdon had no intention of making the use of it that he     afterwards did.\" [76]  [Footnote 76: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 11-12. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 42.]  Thus authenticated, Dr. Winter's statement may be given as much weight as though reduced to writing by himself.  RIGDON FOREKNOWS THE COMING AND CONTENTS OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.  The Rev. Adamson Bentley (whose wife was sister to Mrs. Sidney Rigdon) wrote the following to Walter Scott under date of January 22, 1841:      \"I know that Sidney Rigdon told me that there was a book coming     out, the manuscript of which had been found engraved on gold     plates, as much as two years before the Mormon book made its     appearance or had been heard of by me.\"  This statement was published in the _Millennial Harbinger_ for 1844, with the following editorial note from Rev. Alexander Campbell:      \"The conversation alluded to in Brother Bentley's letter of 1841     was in my presence as well as his, and my recollection of it led     me, some two or three years ago, to interrogate Brother Bentley     touching his recollection of it, which accorded with mine in every     particular, except the year in which it occurred, he placing it in     the summer of 1827, I in the summer of 1826, Rigdon at the same     time observing that in the plates dug up in New York there was an     account, not only of the aborigines of this country, but also it     was stated that the Christian religion had been preached in this     country during the first century, just as we were preaching it in     the Western Reserve.\" [77]  [Footnote 77: Besides _Millennial Harbinger_ 1844, p. 39, see \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 12 and 13. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]  It will be remembered that Rigdon lived for a time at his brother-in-law Bentley's house, and that it was Scott, Campbell, and Rigdon who, in Pittsburg, organized the Disciple Church in 1824 or 1825. The above statements were published in the _Millennial Harbinger_ in 1844 (p. 39), twenty-two years before Rigdon's death, yet he never published a denial to either. It seems that before that publication Adamson Bentley was orally making statements, probably to the same effect, which remained undenied by Rigdon, though he published a card denouncing his brother-in-law. [78]  [Footnote 78: _Evening and Morning Star,_ 301.]  Mrs. Amos Dunlap, a niece of Mrs. Rigdon, under date of Warren, O., December 7, 1879, writes this:      \"When I was quite a child I visited Mr. Rigdon's family. He married     my aunt. They at that time lived at Bainbridge, O. [1826-7]. During     my visit Mr. Rigdon went to his bedroom and took from a trunk which     he kept locked, a certain manuscript. He came out into the other     room and seated himself by the fireplace and commenced reading it.     His wife at that moment came into the room and exclaimed: 'What,     are you studying that thing again?' or something to that effect.     She then added: 'I mean to burn that paper.' He said, 'No indeed,     you will not; this will be a great thing some day.' Whenever he was     reading this he was so completely occupied that he seemed entirely     unconscious of anything passing around him.\" [79]  [Footnote 79: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 12. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]  Since Rigdon never, in person or by anyone else, has claimed to have written any such manuscript of his own, in the light of other evidence here adduced, we are warranted in believing that to have been Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found.\"  The Rev. D. Atwater, under date Mantua Station, O., April 26, 1873, three years before Rigdon's death, writes this:      \"Soon after this the great Mormon defection came on us     [Disciples]. Sidney Rigdon preached for us, and notwithstanding     his extravagantly wild freaks, he was held in high repute by many.     For a few months before his professed conversion to Mormonism, it     was noticed that his wild, extravagant propensities had been more     marked. That he knew before of the coming of the Book of Mormon is     to me certain from what he said [during] the first of his visits at     my father's some years before. He gave a wonderful description of     the mounds and other antiquities found in some parts of America,     and said that they must have been made by the aborigines. He said     that there was a book to be published containing an account of     those things. He spoke of these in his eloquent, enthusiastic     style, as being a thing most extraordinary. Though a youth then,     I took him to task for expending so much enthusiasm on such a     subject, instead of things of the gospel.\" [80]  [Footnote 80: \"Early History of the Disciples in the Western Reserve,\" 239-240, copied in \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 13. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]  Of this statement Rigdon never made a denial.  Dr. S. Rosa, under date of Painsville, O., June 3, 1841, writes, among other things, this:      \"In the early part of the year 1830, when the Book of Mormon     appeared, [and in November of which year Rigdon was converted],     either in May or June, I was in company with Sidney Rigdon, and     rode with him on horseback a few miles. Our conversation was     principally upon the subject of religion, as he "]]]
