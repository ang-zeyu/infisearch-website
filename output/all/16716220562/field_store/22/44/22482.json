Annapolis     THE CRISIS  BOOK I     CHAPTER I  WHICH DEALS WITH ORIGINS  Faithfully to relate how Eliphalet Hopper came try St. Louis is to betray no secret. Mr. Hopper is wont to tell the story now, when his daughter-in-law is not by; and sometimes he tells it in her presence, for he is a shameless and determined old party who denies the divine right of Boston, and has taken again to chewing tobacco.  When Eliphalet came to town, his son's wife, Mrs: Samuel D. (or S. Dwyer as she is beginning to call herself), was not born. Gentlemen of Cavalier and Puritan descent had not yet begun to arrive at the Planters' House, to buy hunting shirts and broad rims, belts and bowies, and depart quietly for Kansas, there to indulge in that; most pleasurable of Anglo-Saxon pastimes, a free fight. Mr. Douglas had not thrown his bone of Local Sovereignty to the sleeping dogs of war.  To return to Eliphalet's arrival,--a picture which has much that is interesting in it. Behold the friendless boy he stands in the prow of the great steamboat 'Louisiana' of a scorching summer morning, and looks with something of a nameless disquiet on the chocolate waters of the Mississippi. There have been other sights, since passing Louisville, which might have disgusted a Massachusetts lad more. A certain deck on the 'Paducah', which took him as far as Cairo, was devoted to cattle --black cattle. Eliphalet possessed a fortunate temperament. The deck was dark, and the smell of the wretches confined there was worse than it should have been. And the incessant weeping of some of the women was annoying, inasmuch as it drowned many of the profane communications of the overseer who was showing Eliphalet the sights. Then a fine-linened planter from down river had come in during the conversation, and paying no attention to the overseer's salute cursed them all into silence, and left.  Eliphalet had ambition, which is not a wholly undesirable quality. He began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable fellow-creatures. He reached out and touched lightly a young mulatto woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms. The peculiar dumb expression on her face was lost on Eliphalet. The overseer had laughed coarsely.  \"What, skeered on 'em?\" said he. And seizing the girl by the cheek, gave it a cruel twinge that brought a cry out of her.  Eliphalet had reflected upon this incident after he had bid the overseer good-by at Cairo, and had seen that pitiful coffle piled aboard a steamer for New Orleans. And the result of his reflections was, that some day he would like to own slaves.  A dome of smoke like a mushroom hung over the city, visible from far down the river, motionless in the summer air. A long line of steamboats --white, patient animals--was tethered along the levee, and the Louisiana presently swung in her bow toward a gap in this line, where a mass of people was awaiting her arrival. Some invisible force lifted Eliphalet's eyes to the upper deck, where they rested, as if by appointment, on the trim figure of the young man in command of the Louisiana. He was very young for the captain of a large New Orleans packet. When his lips moved, something happened. Once he raised his voice, and a negro stevedore rushed frantically aft, as if he had received the end of a lightning-bolt. Admiration burst from the passengers, and one man cried out Captain Brent's age--it was thirty-two.  Eliphalet snapped his teeth together. He was twenty-seven, and his ambition actually hurt him at such times. After the boat was fast to the landing stage he remained watching the captain, who was speaking a few parting words to some passengers of fashion. The body-servants were taking their luggage to the carriages. Mr. Hopper envied the captain his free and vigorous speech, his ready jokes, and his hearty laugh. All the rest he knew for his own--in times to come. The carriages, the trained servants, the obsequiousness of the humbler passengers. For of such is the Republic.  Then Eliphalet picked his way across the hot stones of the levee, pushing hither and thither in the rough crowd of river men; dodging the mules on the heavy drays, or making way for the carriages of the few people of importance who arrived on the boat. If any recollections of a cool, white farmhouse amongst barren New England hills disturbed his thoughts, this is not recorded. He gained the mouth of a street between the low houses which crowded on the broad river front. The black mud was thick under his feet from an overnight shower, and already steaming in the sun. The brick pavement was lumpy from much travel and near as dirty as the street. Here, too, were drays blocking the way, and sweaty negro teamsters swinging cowhides over the mules. The smell of many wares poured through the open doors, mingling with the perspiration of the porters. On every side of him were busy clerks, with their suspenders much in evidence, and Eliphalet paused once or twice to listen to their talk. It was tinged with that dialect he had heard, since leaving Cincinnati.  Turning a corner, Eliphalet came abruptly upon a prophecy. A great drove of mules was charging down the gorge of the street, and straight at him. He dived into an entrance, and stood looking at the animals in startled wonder as they thundered by, flinging the mud over the pavements. A cursing lot of drovers on ragged horses made the rear guard.  Eliphalet mopped his brow. The mules seemed to have aroused in him some sense of his atomity, where the sight of the pillar of smoke and of the black cattle had failed. The feeling of a stranger in a strange land was upon him at last. A strange land, indeed! Could it be one with his native New England? Did Congress assemble from the Antipodes? Wasn't the great, ugly river and dirty city at the end of the earth, to be written about in Boston journals?  Turning in the doorway, he saw to his astonishment a great store, with high ceilings supported by columns. The door was stacked high with bales of dry goods. Beside him was a sign in gold lettering, \"Carvel and Company, Wholesale Dry Goods.\" And lastly, looking down upon him with a quizzical expression, was a gentleman. There was no mistaking the gentleman. He was cool, which Eliphalet was not. And the fact is the more remarkable because the gentleman was attired according to the fashion of the day for men of his age, in a black coat with a teal of ruffled shirt showing, and a heavy black stock around his collar. He had a white mustache, and a goatee, and white hair under his black felt hat. His face was long, his nose straight, and the sweetness of its smile had a strange effect upon Eliphalet, who stood on one foot.  \"Well, sonny, scared of mules, are you?\" The speech is a stately drawl very different from the nasal twang of Eliphalet's bringing up. \"Reckon you don't come from anywhere round here?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Eliphalet. \"From Willesden, Massachusetts.\"  \"Come in on the 'Louisiana'?\"  \"Yes, sir.\" But why this politeness?  The elderly gentleman lighted a cigar. The noise of the rushing mules had now become a distant roar, like a whirlwind which has swept by. But Eliphalet did not stir.  \"Friends in town?\" inquired the gentleman at length.  \"No, sir,\" sighed Mr. Hopper.  At this point of the conversation a crisp step sounded from behind and wonderful smile came again on the surface.  \"Mornin', Colonel,\" said a voice which made Eliphalet jump. And he swung around to perceive the young captain of the Louisiana.  \"Why, Captain Lige,\" cried the Colonel, without ceremony, \"and how do you find yourself to-day, suh? A good trip from Orleans? We did not look for you so soon.\"  \"Tolluble, Colonel, tolluble,\" said the young man, grasping the Colonel's hand. \"Well, Colonel, I just called to say that I got the seventy bales of goods you wanted.\"  \"Ephum\" cried the Colonel, diving toward a counter where glasses were set out,--a custom new to Eliphalet,--\"Ephum, some of that very particular Colonel Crittenden sent me over from Kentucky last week.\"  An old darkey, with hair as white as the Colonel's, appeared from behind the partition.  \"I 'lowed you'd want it, Marse Comyn, when I seed de Cap'n comin',\" said he, with the privilege of an old servant. Indeed, the bottle was beneath his arm.  The Colonel smiled.  \"Hope you'se well, Cap'n,\" said Ephum, as he drew the cork.  \"Tolluble, Ephum,\" replied the Captain. \"But, Ephum--say, Ephum!\"  \"Y"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5388"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 01 (#1)"],["body","es, sah.\"  \"How's my little sweetheart, Ephum?\"  \"Bress your soul, sah,\" said Ephum, his face falling perceptibly, \"bress your soul, sah, Miss Jinny's done gone to Halcyondale, in Kaintuck, to see her grandma. Ole Ephum ain't de same nigger when she's away.\"  The young Captain's face showed as much disappointment as the darkey's.  \"Cuss it!\" said he, strongly, \"if that ain't too bad! I brought her a Creole doll from New Orleans, which Madame Claire said was dressed finer than any one she'd ever seen. All lace and French gewgaws, Colonel. But you'll send it to her?\"  \"That I will, Lige,\" said the Colonel, heartily. \"And she shall write you the prettiest note of thanks you ever got.\"  \"Bless her pretty face,\" cried the Captain. \"Her health, Colonel! Here's a long life to Miss Virginia Carvel, and may she rule forever! How old did you say this was?\" he asked, looking into the glass.  \"Over half a century,\" said Colonel Carvel.  \"If it came from the ruins of Pompeii,\" cried Captain Brent, \"it might be worthy of her!\"  \"What an idiot you are about that child, Lige,\" said the Colonel, who was not hiding his pleasure. The Colonel could hide nothing. \"You ruin her!\"  The bluff young Captain put down his glass to laugh.  \"Ruin her!\" he exclaimed. \"Her pa don't ruin her I eh, Ephum? Her pa don't ruin her!\"  \"Lawsy, Marse Lige, I reckon he's wuss'n any.\"  \"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, pulling his goatee thoughtfully, \"you're a damned impertinent nigger. I vow I'll sell you South one of these days. Have you taken that letter to Mr. Renault?\" He winked at his friend as the old darkey faded into the darkness of the store, and continued: \"Did I ever tell you about Wilson Peale's portrait of my grandmother, Dorothy Carvel, that I saw this summer at my brother Daniel's, in Pennsylvania? Jinny's going to look something like her, sir. Um! She was a fine woman. Black hair, though. Jinny's is brown, like her Ma's.\" The Colonel handed a cigar to Captain Brent, and lit one himself. \"Daniel has a book my grandfather wrote, mostly about her. Lord, I remember her! She was the queen-bee of the family while she lived. I wish some of us had her spirit.\"  \"Colonel,\" remarked Captain Lige, \"what's this I heard on the levee just now about your shootin' at a man named Babcock on the steps here?\"  The Colonel became very grave. His face seemed to grow longer as he pulled his goatee.  \"He was standing right where you are, sir,\" he replied (Captain Lige moved), \"and he proposed that I should buy his influence.\"  \"What did you do?\"  Colonel Carvel laughed quietly at the recollection  \"Shucks,\" said he, \"I just pushed him into the streets gave him a little start, and put a bullet past his ear, just to let the trash know the sound of it. Then Russell went down and bailed me out.\"  The Captain shook with laughter. But Mr. Eliphalet Hopper's eyes were glued to the mild-mannered man who told the story, and his hair rose under his hat.  \"By the way, Lige, how's that boy, Tato? Somehow after I let you have him on the 'Louisiana', I thought I'd made a mistake to let him run the river. Easter's afraid he'll lose the little religion she taught him.\"  It was the Captain's turn to be grave.  \"I tell you what, Colonel,\" said he; \"we have to have hands, of course. But somehow I wish this business of slavery had never been started!\"  \"Sir,\" said the Colonel, with some force, \"God made the sons of Ham the servants of Japheth's sons forever and forever.\"  \"Well, well, we won't quarrel about that, sir,\" said Brent, quickly. \"If they all treated slaves as you do, there wouldn't be any cry from Boston-way. And as for me, I need hands. I shall see you again, Colonel.\"  \"Take supper with me to-night, Lige,\" said Mr. Carvel. \"I reckon you'll find it rather lonesome without Jinny.\"  \"Awful lonesome,\" said the Captain. \"But you'll show me her letters, won't you?\"  He started out, and ran against Eliphalet.  \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Who's this?\"  \"A young Yankee you landed here this morning, Lige,\" said the Colonel. \"What do you think of him?\"  \"Humph!\" exclaimed the Captain.  \"He has no friends in town, and he is looking for employment. Isn't that so, sonny?\" asked the Colonels kindly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Come, Lige, would you take him?\" said Mr. Carvel.  The young Captain looked into Eliphalet's face. The dart that shot from his eyes was of an aggressive honesty; and Mr. Hopper's, after an attempt at defiance, were dropped.  \"No,\" said the Captain.  \"Why not, Lige?\"  \"Well, for one thing, he's been listening,\" said Captain Lige, as he departed.  Colonel Carvel began to hum softly to himself:--      \"'One said it was an owl, and the other he said nay,      One said it was a church with the steeple torn away,      Look a' there now!'  \"I reckon you're a rank abolitionist,\" said he to Eliphalet, abruptly.  \"I don't see any particular harm in keepin' slaves,\" Mr. Hopper replied, shifting to the other foot.  Whereupon the Colonel stretched his legs apart, seized his goatee, pulled his head down, and gazed at him for some time from under his eyebrows, so searchingly that the blood flew to Mr. Hopper's fleshy face. He mopped it with a dark-red handkerchief, stared at everything in the place save the gentleman in front of him, and wondered whether he had ever in his life been so uncomfortable. Then he smiled sheepishly, hated himself, and began to hate the Colonel.  \"Ever hear of the Liberator?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Mr. Hopper.  \"Where do you come from?\" This was downright directness, from which there was no escape.  \"Willesden, Massachusetts.\"  \"Umph! And never heard of Mr. Garrison?\"  \"I've had to work all my life.\"  \"What can you do, sonny?\"  \"I cal'late to sweep out a store. I have kept books,\" Mr. Hopper vouchsafed.  \"Would you like work here?\" asked the Colonel, kindly. The green eyes looked up swiftly, and down again.  \"What'll you give me?\"  The good man was surprised. \"Well,\" said he, \"seven dollars a week.\"  Many a time in after life had the Colonel reason to think over this scene. He was a man the singleness of whose motives could not be questioned. The one and sufficient reason for giving work to a homeless boy, from the hated state of the Liberator, was charity. The Colonel had his moods, like many another worthy man.  The small specks on the horizon sometimes grow into the hugest of thunder clouds. And an act of charity, out of the wisdom of God, may produce on this earth either good or evil.  Eliphalet closed with the bargain. Ephum was called and told to lead the recruit to the presence of Mr. Hood, the manager. And he spent the remainder of a hot day checking invoices in the shipping entrance on Second Street.  It is not our place here to chronicle Eliphalet's faults. Whatever he may have been, he was not lazy. But he was an anomaly to the rest of the young men in the store, for those were days when political sentiments decided fervent loves or hatreds. In two days was Eliphalet's reputation for wisdom made. During that period he opened his mouth to speak but twice. The first was in answer to a pointless question of Mr. Barbo's (aetat 25), to the effect that he, Eliphalet Hopper, was a Pierce Democrat, who looked with complacency on the extension of slavery. This was wholly satisfactory, and saved the owner of these sentiments a broken head. The other time Eliphalet spoke was to ask Mr. Barbo to direct him to a boardinghouse.  \"I reckon,\" Mr. Barbo reflected, \"that you'll want one of them Congregational boarding-houses. We've got a heap of Yankees in the town, and they all flock together and pray together. I reckon you'd ruther go to Miss Crane's nor anywhere.\"  Forthwith to Miss Crane's Eliphalet went. And that lady, being a Greek herself, knew a Greek when she saw one. The kind-hearted Barbo lingered in the gathering darkness to witness the game which ensued, a game dear to all New Englanders, comical to Barbo. The two contestants calculated. Barbo reckoned, and put his money on his new-found fellow-clerk. Eliphalet, indeed, never showed to better advantage. The shyness he had used with the Colonel, and the taciturnity practised on his fellow-clerks, he slipped off like coat and waistcoat for the battle. The scene was in the front yard of the third house in Dorcas Row. Everybody knows where Dorcas Row was. Miss Crane, tall, with all the severity of side curls and bombazine, stood like a stone lioness at the gate. In the background, by the steps, the boarders sat, an interested group. Eliphalet girded up his loins, and sharpened his nasal twang to cope with hers. The preliminary sparring was an exchange of compliments, and deceived neither party. It seemed rather to heighten mutual respect.  \"You be from Willesden, eh?\" said Crane. \"I calculate you know the Salters.\"  If the truth were known, this evidence of an apparent omniscience rather staggered Eliphalet. But training stood by him, and he showed no dismay. Yes, he knew the Salters, and had drawed many a load out of Hiram Salters' wood-lot to help pay for his schooling.  \"Let me see,\" said Miss Crane, innocently; \"who was it one of them Salters girls married, and lived across the way from the meetin'-house?\"  \"Spauldin',\" was the prompt reply.  \"Wal, I want t' know!\" cried the spinster: \"not Ezra Spauldin'?\"  Eliphalet nodded. That nod was one of infinite shrewdness which commended itself to Miss Crane. These courtesies, far from making awkward the material discussion which followed; did not affect it in the least.  \"So you want me to board you?\" said she, as if in consternation.  Eliphalet calculated, if they could come to terms. And Mr. Barbo keyed himself to enjoyment.  \"Single gentlemen,\" said she, \"pay as high as twelve dollars.\" And she added that they had no cause to complain of her table.  Eliphalet said he guessed he'd have to go somewhere else. Upon this the lady vouchsafed the explanation that those gentlemen had high positions and rented her large rooms. Since Mr. Hopper was from Willesden and knew the Salters,"]]]
