But, not to be outdone in fun, and also, to keep herself from growing serious, she sang back at him:      \"I don't want to stay at this place,        I don't like it any more!      I am going to the mountains,        Where I've never been before.      I shall tramp the mountain pathways,        I shall climb the mountain's peak;      I don't want to stay in this place,        So I'll go away next week!\"  \"All right for you!\" declared Jack. \"Go on, and joy go with you! But don't you send me any picture postcards of yourself lost in a perilous mountain fastness,--'cause I won't come and rescue you. So there!\"  \"What is a mountain fastness?\" demanded Patty. \"It sounds frisky.\"  \"It isn't,\" replied Jack; \"it's a deep gorge, with ice-covered walls and no way out; and as the darkness falls, dreadful growls are heard on all sides, and wild animals prowl--and prowl--and prow-ow-owl!\"  Jack's voice grew deep and terrible, as he suggested the awful situation, but Patty laughed gaily as she said:  \"Well, as long as they keep on prowling, they certainly can't harm me. It all sounds rather interesting. At any rate, the ice-covered walls sound cool. You must admit Spring Beach is a hot place.\"  \"All places are hot in hot weather,\" observed Beatrice, sapiently; \"when there's an ocean breeze, it's lovely and cool here.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Lora, \"when there IS. But there 'most generally ISN'T. To-day, I'm sure the thermometer must be about two hundred.\"  \"That's your heated imagination,\" said Jack. \"It's really about eighty-four in the shade.\"  \"Let's move around into the shade, then,\" said Patty. \"This side of the veranda is getting sunny.\"  So the young people went round the corner of the house to a cooler spot, and Nan expressed her intention of going down to the train to meet Mr. Fairfield.  \"You people,\" began Patty, after Nan had left them, \"mustn't talk as you do about my going away, before my stepmother. You see, we're going because she wants to go, but it isn't polite to rub it in!\"  \"I know it,\" said Beatrice, \"but I forgot it. But, I say, Patty, I think it's too bad for you to be trailed off there just to please her.\"  \"Not at all, Bee. She has stayed here three months to please me, and turn about is fair play.\"  \"It's Fairfield play, at any rate,\" put in Jack. \"You're a trump, Patty, to take it so sweetly. I wish you didn't have to go, though.\"  \"So say we all of us,\" declared Lora, but Patty ordered them, rather earnestly, to drop the subject and not refer to it again.  \"You must write me all about the Pageant, girls,\" she went on.  \"Can't I write too, though I'm not a girl?\" asked Jack.  \"No!\" cried Patty, holding up her hands in pretended horror. \"I couldn't receive a letter from a young man!\"  \"Oh, try it,\" said Jack, laughing. \"I'll help you. You've no idea how easy it is! Have you never had a letter from a man?\"  \"From papa,\" said Patty, putting the tip of her finger in her mouth, and speaking babyishly.  \"Papa, nothing! You get letters from those New York chaps, don't you, now?\"  \"Who New York chaps?\" asked Patty, opening her eyes wide, with an over-innocent stare.  \"Oh, that Harper kid and that Farrington cub and that Hepworth old gentleman!\"  \"What pretty pet names you call them! Yes, I get letters from them, but they're my lifelong friends.\"  \"That's the position I'm applying for. Don't you need one more L. L. F.?\" But Patty had turned to the girls, and they were counting up what few parties were to take place before Patty went away.  \"I'd have a farewell party myself,\" said Patty, thoughtfully, \"but there's so little time now, and Nan's pretty busy. I hate to bother her with it. You see, we leave next week,--Thursday.\"  \"And our house party comes that very day!\" said Beatrice, regretfully. \"And Captain Sayre is coming. He's the most stunning man! He's our second cousin, and older than we are, but he's just grand, isn't he, Lora?\"  \"Yes; and he'd adore Patty. Oh, girlie, DON'T go!\"  \"I think I'll kidnap Patty,\" said Jack. \"The day they start, I'll waylay the party as they board the train, and carry Patty off by force.\"  \"You'd have to get out a force of militia,\" laughed Patty. \"My father Fairfield is of a sharp-eyed disposition. You couldn't carry off his daughter under his nose.\"  \"Strategy!\" whispered Jack, in a deep, mysterious voice. \"I could manage it, somehow, I'm sure.\"  \"Well, it wouldn't do any good. He'd just come back after me, and we'd take the next train. But, oh, girls, I do wish I could stay here! I never had such a disappointment before. I've grown to love this place; and all you people; and my dear Camilla!\" Patty's blue eyes filled with real tears, as she dropped her light and bantering manner, and spoke earnestly.  \"It's a shame!\" declared Jack, as he noted the drops trembling on the long, curled lashes. \"Come on, girls, I'm going home before I express myself too strongly.\"  So Jack and the Sayre girls went away, and Patty went up to her own room.     CHAPTER II  MONA'S PLAN   That night, when Patty was alone in her own room, she threw herself into a rocking chair, and rocked violently, as was her habit, when she had anything to bother her. She looked about at the pretty room, furnished with all her dear and cherished belongings.  \"To go away from all this,\" she thought, \"and be mewed up in a little bare room, with a few sticks of horrid old furniture, and nowhere to put things away decently!\"  She glanced at her room wardrobes and numerous chiffoniers and dressing-tables.  \"Live in a trunk, I s'pose,\" she went on to herself; \"all my best frocks in a mess of wrinkles, all my best hats smashed to windmills! No broad ocean to look at! Nothing but mountains with trees all over their sides! Nothing to do but walk up rocky, steep paths to a spring, take a drink of water, and come stumbling down again! In the evenings, dress up, and promenade eighty thousand feet of veranda, AS ADVERTISED!\"  Roused to a frenzy by her own self-pity and indignation, Patty got up and stalked about the room. She flung off her pretty summer frock, and slipped on a blue silk kimono. Then she sat down in front of her dressing-table to brush her hair for the night.  She drew out the pins, and great curly masses came tumbling down around her shoulders. Patty's hair was truly golden, and did not turn darker as she grew older.  She brushed away slowly, and looked at herself in the mirror. What she saw must have surprised her, for she dropped her brush in astonishment.  \"Well, Patricia Fairfield!\" she exclaimed to her own reflection. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself! YOU, who are supposed to be of amiable disposition, YOU whom people call 'Sunshine,' because of your good nature, YOU who have every joy and every blessing that heart can wish, you look like a sour-faced, cross-grained, disgruntled old maid! So there now! And, Miss, do you want to know what _I_ think of you?\" She picked up her hair brush, and shook it at the flushed, angry face in the mirror. \"Well, _I_ think you're a monster of selfishness! You're a dragon of ingratitude! And a griffin of cross-patchedness! Now, Miss, WILL you drop this attitude of injured innocence, and act like a civilised human being?\"  Patty was a little over hard on herself. She hadn't at all exhibited such traits as she charged herself with, but she was not a girl to do things by halves. She sat, calmly looking at her own face, until the lines smoothed themselves out of her forehead, the dimples came back to her cheeks, and the laughter to her blue eyes.  \"That's better!\" she said, wagging her head at the pretty, smiling face. \"Now, never again, Patty Fairfield, let me see you looking mopy or peevish about anything! Mind, not about anything at all! You have enough blessings and pleasures to make up for any disappointments that may come to you. So, now that you've braced up, just STAY braced up! See?\"  The scolding, though self-inflicted, did Patty good, and humming a lively tune, she busied herself with arranging some fans and frills in boxes to take away with her.  If stray thoughts of the Pageant or the Fancy Dance crept into her mind, she determinedly thrust them out, and forced her anticipations to the unknown fun and gaiety she would enjoy at the big Mountain Houses.  And when at last, ready for bed, she stood in front of her long cheval glass, the folds of her blue dressing gown trailing away from her pretty, lace-frilled nightgown, she shook her forefinger warningly at the smiling reflection.  \"Now, mind you, Patricia, not a whimper out of you to-morrow! Not a shadow of a shade of disappointment on your fair young brow? Only happy smiles and pleasant words, and just MAKE yourself enjoy the prospect of those poky, gloomy, horrid old mountains!\"  It will be easily seen that Patty was amenable to discipline, for next morning she went dancing downstairs, looking like amiability personified. Even Nan came to the conclusion that Patty was reconciled to the mountain trip, and had begun to see the pleasanter side of it.  Mr. Fairfield regarded his daughter approvingly. Though Patty had not been cross or glum the day before, she had been silent, and now she treated her hearers to a flood of gay and merry chatter.  Only a fleeting shadow across her face, or a sudden, pained look in her eyes when Spring Beach matters were mentioned, revealed to her watchful father the fact that Patty's gaiety was the result of brave and honest will-power. But such shadows passed as quickly as they came, and the girl's pleasant and sweet demeanour was not unappreciated by her elders.  She joined heartily in the plans for the mountain trip; discussed itineraries with her father, and costumes with Nan.  As the three sat on the veranda, thus engaged, a flying figure came through the gate like a whirlwind, and Mona Galbraith precipitated herself into the family group.  \"Why, Mona, you look a little,--er,--hasty!\" exclaimed Patty as, out of breath, their visitor plumped herself into a swing and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5264"],["title","Patty's Butterfly Days (#2)"],["body","its tasselled ropes, while she regained her breath.  \"Yes,--yes,--and well I may!\" she panted. \"What DO you think, Patty? Oh, Mr. Fairfield, DO say yes! Coax him to, won't you, Mrs. Fairfield! Oh, I can't tell you,--I daren't! I just KNOW you won't do it! Oh, Patty, do,--DO!\"  Impetuous Mona had swayed out of the swing in her eagerness, and was now kneeling by Patty's side, stroking her hand, and gazing into her face with imploring eyes.  \"Mona Galbraith,\" said Patty, laughing, \"are you rehearsing for melodrama, or what? For, if so, you don't know your lines, and you're 'way off on your gestures, and--and, as a whole, your act is not convincing.\"  \"Oh, don't say that, Patty!\" exclaimed Mona, laughing herself. \"ANYTHING but that! It must be convincing,--it must,--it MUST!\"  \"Is it meant for a roaring farce?\" asked Mr. Fairfield, politely, \"or merely high comedy?\"  \"I think it's a problem play,\" said Nan, laughing anew at the excited visitor, who had returned to the swing, and was vigorously pushing herself back and forth with her slippered toe.  \"Let me help you, Mona,\" said Mr. Fairfield, kindly. \"Is it something you have to tell us,--or ask us?\"  \"Yes, sir, yes! That's it!\"  \"Well, tell us, then. But take your time and tell us quietly. Then you won't get incoherent.\"  The quiet friendliness of his tones seemed to reassure the girl, and letting the swing stand still, Mona began:  \"You see, Mr. Fairfield,--and Mrs. Fairfield, my father is going to Europe next week. It's on a business trip, and he only just found out that he had to go. He will take me with him if I want to go, but I don't! So I proposed a plan to him instead of that, which he thinks is fine. And,--and, I want to know what you think about it.\"  \"We will probably approve of it, if your father does,\" said Nan, helpfully.  \"Well--it's just this. For me to stay at home, and keep our house open, and have Patty stay there with me, instead of her going to the mountains with you.\"  \"You and Patty stay there alone!\" exclaimed Mr. Fairfield.  \"No, sir; not alone. Father would ask his sister, my Aunt Adelaide, to stay with us, as chaperon. She's a lovely lady, and she'd be glad to come.\"  \"Well, I don't know,--I don't know,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"I'm not sure I could go off and leave Patty with strangers.\"  \"But I'm not a stranger,\" said Mona, \"and Aunt Adelaide won't be, as soon as you know her. I haven't seen her myself for some years, but she's a lovely, sweet character,--everybody says so. And then, you see, we wouldn't have to close up our house, and Patty wouldn't have to leave Spring Beach,--and, oh, we could have lovely times!\"  \"How long will your father be gone?\"  \"Two months. August and September. He would rather take me with him, but he said if you all agreed to my plan, he would do so, too.\"  \"Well, it's a surprise,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"and we'll have to think it over, and talk it over. How does it strike you, Patty?\"  Patty considered. It was her habit to decide quickly, but this was a case with several sides to be looked at. Yet, of course, it must be decided at once, for Mr. Galbraith must have time to make his preparations.  Patty's heart jumped with joy at the thought of staying at Spring Beach instead of going to the mountains. But--the joy was a little dampened at the idea of staying with Mona, and not at \"The Pebbles.\"  \"Why can't we both stay here?\" she said at last. \"Let Mona visit me here, and let her aunt chaperon us just the same.\"  \"Oh, no,\" Mona said. \"I know father wouldn't consent to that. You see, it's a great undertaking to close up our big place, and find homes for the servants, and look after the horses and gardens and all that, just for two months. Father was relieved at the thought of just walking off and leaving it all in charge of Aunt Adelaide. And then, we could have so much more room there, you know--\" Mona paused, blushing. She did not want to imply that \"Red Chimneys\" was a grandly appointed mansion, while \"The Pebbles\" was only a pretty cottage, but that was what she meant.  \"Yes, I know,\" said Nan, kindly helping her out. \"You have such immense grounds, and luxuries of all sorts. Why, your place is a Pleasure Park of itself, with the pond and tennis court, and fountains and grottoes and all such things.\"  \"Yes, it is a lovely summer place,\" said Mona, earnestly, \"and I should do everything I could to make Patty happy there. I know how much she wants to stay at Spring Beach, and it seemed such a satisfactory plan all round.\"  Patty was still thinking. But, by this time, she was wondering if she were really a selfish, disagreeable snob or not. For, the truth was, Patty did not entirely like Mona, though she had grown to like her much better than at first. Nor did she like Mona's home, with its ostentatiously expensive appointments, both indoors and out. And yet, it was exceedingly comfortable and luxurious, and Patty knew she could do exactly as she chose in every respect.  But, again, Patty was a favourite in Spring Beach society, and Mona was not. This might cause complications in the matter of invitations to entertainments. But Patty knew this would mostly redound to Mona's benefit. She would be asked on Patty's account to places where otherwise she would not have been invited. And Patty well knew SHE would be left out of nothing just because she was visiting Mona.  And yet, to accept her hospitality for two months meant to acknowledge her as an intimate friend,--a chosen companion. Was it quite honest to do this when, privately, Patty disapproved of many of Mona's ways and tastes? Then, it occurred to Patty that Mr. Hepworth had urged her to do what she could to help Mona,--to improve her manners, her dress, her tastes. Patty jumped at this idea, and then as suddenly paused to scrutinise her own motives, and make sure she was not pretending to herself that she did for Mona's sake what she was really doing for her own. But being quick at decisions, she saw at once that it was about evenly divided. She was willing, if she could, to help Mona in any way, and she felt that this justified her in accepting the offered hospitality of one whom she couldn't emulate.  Mr. Fairfield watched Patty's face closely, and knew pretty well what sort of a mental controversy she was holding with herself. He was not surprised when she said at last:  \"Well, so far as I have a voice in this matter, I'd like to go. I think it's very kind of Mona to ask me, and I'd try not to be a troublesome visitor. You know, Father Fairfield, how much I would rather stay in Spring Beach than go to the mountains. And I suppose I could take my motor-car to Mona's with me.\"  \"Yes, of course,\" Mona said. \"And father says if I don't go to Europe, he'll buy me a runabout just like yours, and we can have lovely times going out together.\"  \"Would your aunt come at once?\" asked Nan, who wanted to know more about the chaperon who would have Patty in charge.  \"Yes, father will send for her as soon as we decide. But you know, Mrs. Fairfield, I should keep house, as I always do, and Aunt Adelaide would only be with us in the cause of propriety.\"  Nan smiled at the thought of Mona's housekeeping, for \"Red Chimneys\" was so liberally provided with servants that Mona's duties consisted mainly in mentioning her favourite dishes to the cook.  \"Are you sure you could behave yourself, Patty?\" asked her father, teasingly, \"without either Nan or myself to keep you in order?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Patty, drawing down the corners of her mouth demurely. \"In fact, as I should be on my own responsibility, I'd have to be even more careful of my manners than I am at home.\"  Mr. Fairfield sighed a little. \"Well, Puss,\" he said, \"I really wanted you with us on our trip, but as you'd rather stay here, and as this way seems providentially opened for you, I can only say you may accept Mona's invitation if you choose.\"  \"Then I DO choose, you dear old Daddy!\" cried Patty, making a rush for her father, and, seating herself on the arm of his chair, she patted his head, while she told him how glad she was of his consent. \"For,\" she said, \"I made up my mind not to coax. If you didn't agree readily, I was going to abide by your wishes, without a murmur.\"  \"Oh, what a goody-girl!\" said Mr. Fairfield, laughing. \"Now, you see, Virtue is its own reward.\"  \"And I'm SO glad!\" Mona declared, fervently. \"Oh, Patty, we'll have perfectly elegant times! I was so afraid you wouldn't WANT to come to stay with me.\"  \"Oh, yes, I do,\" said Patty, \"but I warn you I'm a self-willed young person, and if I insist on having my own way, what are you going to do?\"  \"Let you have it,\" said Mona, promptly. \"Your way is always better than mine.\"  \"But suppose you two quarrel,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"what can you do then? Patty will have nowhere to go.\"  \"Oh, we won't quarrel,\" said Mona, confidently. \"Patty's too sweet-tempered,--\"  \"And you're too amiable,\" supplemented Nan, who was fond of Mona in some ways, though not in others. But she, too, thought that Patty would have a good influence over the motherless girl, and she was honestly glad that Patty could stay at her beloved seashore for the rest of the summer.  So it was settled, and Mona went flying home to carry the glad news to her father, and to begin at once to arrange Patty's rooms.     CHAPTER III  SUSAN TO THE RESCUE   The day that Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield were to start on their trip to the mountains came during what is known as \"a hot spell.\" It was one of those days when life seems almost unbearable,--when the slightest exertion seems impossible.  There was no breeze from the ocean, and the faint, languid land breeze that now and then gave an uncertain puff, was about as refreshing as a heat-wave from an opened furnace door.  At the breakfast table, Patty tried to persuade them not to go that day. \"You'll faint in the train, Nan, on a day like this,\" she said. \"Do wait until to-morrow.\"  \"There's no prospect of its being any better to-morrow,\" said"]]]
