Such a man was Howard L. Krum, who, in further thinking on the subject, came upon the almost simple idea of having the transmitter start the receiver rather than having them both start at the same time. This arrangement required higher speed operation of the receiver and therefore the receiving code pulse positions were spread over a shorter area, which meant progressively decreasing the angular division of the receiving members. Then, to set the received start pulse in the most favorable position with relation to the following code signal reception, an orientation adjustment of the receiver start position was provided.  (Note: On June 20, 1961, Kleinschmidt wrote to Howard Krum—then in retirement in California—giving a short description of the Morkrum Company activities, including the wording of the above last two paragraphs, and asking him to write the Morkrum story. Howard Krum replied on July 3, 1961, indicating his approval and saying that he would be glad to put together some notes for Kleinschmidt. It was quite a shock, therefore, when a letter was received from Howard Krum’s son, Charles, in September of 1961, telling of his father’s sudden serious illness. Then, regretfully, it was not long afterwards that word was received of Howard Krum’s death on November 13, 1961.)      [Illustration: Fig. 8                 Morkrum Company No. 12 Typebar Page Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  Howard Krum’s improved method for operating start-stop, permutation-code telegraph systems was first applied to the Morkrum Green Code apparatus to control the selecting and printing operations of the Blickensdoerfer typewheel typewriter.  At this time the Kleinschmidt company and other manufacturers were starting to produce permutation-code, start-stop telegraph printers using typebar printing like the more modern typewriters which began rapidly to replace the Blickensdoerfer, the Hammond, and the other typewheel printing typewriters. Observing this situation, the Morkrum Company started intensive development work to produce the No. 12 typebar page printer, using the typebars and operating mechanism of the L. C. Smith typewriter and platen of a Woodstock typewriter (fig. 8).  Further developments produced the Morkrum No. 11 tape printer which used the Baudot combiner method for selecting and printing characters under control of start-stop, send-receive devices. The No. 11 was a small, compact tape printer operating at fifty words per minute. Quite a number were put into service at hotels and elsewhere for local message service (fig. 9).      [Illustration: Fig. 9                     Morkrum Company No. 11 Tape Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  The new No. 12 typebar page printer found numerous applications. It replaced the Green Code and the earlier Blue Code wherever used. The new No. 12 was installed at Western Union, on some railroads, and in the Chicago Police telegraph system. The No. 12s were also installed by Postal Telegraph on intercity circuits and used as receiving units for the Postal Multiplex. The Postal Multiplex had been designed by Morkrum and Postal engineers with the consultant assistance of Donald Murray who was a friendly associate and had a license agreement with the Morkrum Company covering some of his patents. A few No. 12 Morkrums were shipped abroad for use with the Murray Multiplex; the British Post Office Telegraph and the Australian Telegraph Administration were customers.  Late in 1924 the Morkrum Company and the Kleinschmidt Electric Company joined to form the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation. A story telling of the union of these two companies was published by _Fortune_ magazine in March of 1932.[7]  Before going to that story, it may be of interest to describe an important event concerning the change in the supply of electric power from direct current to 60-cycle alternating current and the final timing to exactly 60 cycles per second of all A.C. power supplies so that our electric clocks may be connected to an A.C. outlet and give correct time.  The advent of correctly timed, 60-cycle A.C. electric power, available throughout the nation, was a great boon to the designers of printing telegraph apparatus and some types of facsimile telegraph and picture transmitting systems. In prior years, overline synchronization of send and receive apparatus was always a problem and never perfect. Today, synchronizing apparatus between terminals becomes the simple matter of providing 60-cycle A.C. synchronous motors. Just plug into a power outlet and you have “sync”!  Henry Ellis Warren, a clock maker, noting the change in electric power service from direct current to 60-cycle alternating current, set about to build a motor to operate at 60-cycle speed but found that the 60-cycle frequency did not always hold to form, and when applied to running a clock, did not hold correct time.  The following excerpt, from _The Romance of Time_,[8] tells of Warren’s activities which led to synchronizing 60-cycle alternating current to exact time:    _Synchronous Electric Time_    One of the most important of all contributions to horology is the work   of an American who has earned the title, “Father of Electric Time.”    Henry Ellis Warren was graduated from Massachusetts Institute of   Technology in 1894. In 1907 he married and settled in Ashland,   Massachusetts. Here it was that he began to work out his idea for   electrically operated timepieces.    His first product was an ingenious battery-operated clock. In 1914 he   organized the Warren Clock Company and set up production in a barn on   his farm. Yet he knew the battery clock was not his goal, for direct   current offered no means of accurate regulation. Direct current flows   constantly in one direction only, like water down a river or like the   passage of time. On the other hand, alternating current changes   direction regularly, like the oscillation of the balance wheel in a   watch. But instead of the usual five times a second of the balance   wheel, most alternating current completes its trip forward and   backward sixty times a second. Obviously, a clock “geared” to such a   frequency would run as reliably as the current.    In 1916, after several years of extensive experimentation, Warren   developed a motor which would start by itself, run on alternating   current, and carry without difficulty the load of reduction gears   driving the clock hands. It could also handle the cams and contacts of   an alarm clock or set in motion a striking or chiming mechanism.    Then came the test. He plugged the clock into the power socket. It   commenced to run. Weeks of observation and checking showed an   irregular error of as much as ten to fifteen minutes a day.    Convinced that his clock was right, Warren discovered that the   alternating current frequency delivered to his barn factory was off   half a cycle per second—59½ and not 60 cycles. This slight deflection   would produce that much time loss in a 24-hour run. When he informed   the electric company of this error, he was met at first with polite   disbelief. Yet he showed such a comprehensive knowledge of the subject   that the company began to recheck their standards.    Warren built several more synchronous clocks and a master regulator of   his own design for power-station use. On one dial of his master clock   there were two hands, black and gold. The black hand was connected to   an accurately adjusted pendulum clock, beating seconds. The gold hand   was driven by the gear train of one of his electric clocks. As long as   the two hands revolved together, the current cycles were exactly 60   per second. Set up in a power station, this allowed the operator to   adjust the turbine generators as needed to keep the two hands of the   master clock together. Thus all other properly set electric clocks on   the same system would keep the same time automatically.    The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston tried out the   master clock on October 23, 1916. Since then this regulation has   continued.    Other power companies adopted Warren’s master clock. Today virtually   all alternating current furnished in America is similarly checked.   Practical electric time is available at the light socket almost   everywhere. But there are additional benefits.    Standardizing the frequency expanded the market for current to run the   increasing number of clocks in use. Yet, from the consumer’s point of   view, each clock draws little current, costing but a few pennies a   month. Uniform frequency also gave more even speeds in motor-driven   machinery, with a resultant improvement in product. It made easier the   joining of one power station to another. Synchronous motors used in   certain meters and recorders produced better, more accurate records at   lower cost.    The Warren enterprise expanded rapidly. The battery clock was   discontinued. The red barn was no longer large enough, and new space   was acquired. The trade mark “Telechron,” meaning “time from a   distance” (from two Greek words), was used to identify all products of   the company. The firm name was changed to stress the name Telechron,   and in 1952 a merger was made with the General Electric Company.   Plants are now operated in Worcester as well as in Ashland,   Massachusetts.  And now back to the telegraph field....                                    CHAPTER 4                     Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation                  (later renamed “Teletype Corporation”)   During and after the first world war, both the Morkrum Company and the Kleinschmidt Electric Company were progressively"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53481"],["title","Printing Telegraphy... A New Era Begins (#6)"],["body","and producing telegraph apparatus and bringing out new and improved operating devices to a point where conflicting patents were at issue. This meant infringement litigation which might destroy both companies. Neither company could obtain orders in sufficient quantity to make the manufacturing of apparatus profitable, and, with costly development work at hand, more capital investment was a continuous requirement.  The following excerpts from the March 1932 issue of _Fortune_[9] tells of the final joining of the two companies.    The Morkrum Co. had no profits to show for its efforts, and one can be   fairly safe in assuming that no other maker of telegraph printers made   profits. There were competitors, of course. Even the first telegraph   invented by Samuel Morse had a printer, but it printed in dots and   dashes instead of in letters of the English alphabet. That original   Morse printer was abandoned as far back as 1844 because a man who   could be trained to read dots and dashes could just as easily be   trained to listen to them. The problem of getting a printer to print   the alphabet was faced by inventors more than half a century ago, and   it was not really a difficult problem. The difficulty was to invent a   printer that was not too complicated and delicate to be reliable, that   was simple enough to be manufactured for a few hundred instead of a   few thousand dollars.    This difficulty occupied many minds other than the Morton-Krum   intelligences. The most noteworthy of Morkrum Co.’s rivals in   printer-making was Edward Kleinschmidt, an inventor who had all the   inventor’s legendary devotion to his task and to nothing else. His   creations included a vaccination shield, an automatic fishing reel,   and the perfection of the Wheatstone perforator. He had been tinkering   with a telegraph printer in one form and another since the beginning   of the century. In 1917 his project was revamped. It had the financial   backing of Charles B. Goodspeed, of the Buckeye Steel Casting Co.;   Paul M. Benedict, assistant to the president of the C. B. & Q.; Edward   Moore, son of Judge Moore of American Can fame; Eldon Bisbee, a New   York lawyer; and one of Mr. Bisbee’s legal clients, Albert Henry   Wiggin, then president of the Chase National Bank. It was Mr.   Goodspeed, a quiet, retiring gentleman, who supplied most of the   corporate (as distinct from inventive) energy of the Kleinschmidt   Electric Co....    In the years from 1917 to 1924 the Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum   companies became the leading makers of telegraph printers, but they   did not have an easy row to hoe. Their only possible customers were   the two great telegraph companies, the Telephone company, the   railroads, and an occasional outside business such as a press   association. The competition was disheartening, and it became keener   with the elevation of Sterling, son of Joy Morton, to the presidency   of the Morkrum Co., an elevation that was mainly a War-time accident,   for Sterling Morton had resigned from his father’s company to enlist   in the Army, had been rejected because of a small steel plate in his   anatomy, and had chosen the Morkrum Co. as an alternative. Engineering   progress was made, sometimes under ludicrous circumstances.    There was one occasion when Sterling Morton, about to sail for Europe,   heard that the Kleinschmidt Co. was about to bring out a simplex   printer. Up to that time both companies had been making printers for   use with multiplex machines. Mr. Morton was afraid that Mr.   Kleinschmidt was about to anticipate him in the simplex development   which was the forerunner of the present teletypewriter. This was a   contingency which Mr. Morton could not well permit. On the spur of the   moment, he called on Howard Krum, who happened to be in New York. They   bought a drawing board, hired a room at the Princeton Club, and worked   for twenty-four hours trying to design such a machine. Completely   baffled by one small detail, they gave up and took a bus for Coney   Island. On the way, Howard Krum doubled up in sudden ecstacy and   inspiration. They rushed from the bus at Coney Island, entered a soda   fountain, and on the spot designed the machine on the back of an   envelope. This simplex machine of the Morkrum Co. and the one   developed by Kleinschmidt at the same time are the machines which make   Teletype commercially important, the substance of the business today.    But engineering progress was not business progress. Both companies   from the standpoint of profits were failures. Their few customers   played them off against each other. In despair, they were both willing   to sell out. At one point Mr. Goodspeed offered the Kleinschmidt   company to Mr. Newcomb Carlton of Western Union for $412,000, the   amount invested in it. Mr. Morton sold his company in all but fact to   Mr. Charles G. du Bois, then president of Western Electric, but Mr. du   Bois went off to Europe, and his substitute refused to see any merit   in the deal. So it fell through. Unable to sell themselves to their   customers, they tried selling themselves to each other. In 1923   Messrs. Goodspeed and Morton came to terms. The Morkrum Co. signed the   agreement and, everything arranged, Mr. Goodspeed went off to bicycle   with his wife in South Africa—whereupon his company suddenly changed   its mind.    That was the situation of these two unfortunate companies in 1924 when   Mr. Morton started a suit for patent infringement against his rivals.   A counter suit was promptly filed. Mr. Goodspeed was quite right when   he said the suits would ruin both—there was every prospect that by the   time the courts had settled things, the patents would have been in   such a snarl that neither could do anything. The suit, in fact, was   Sterling Morton’s way of bringing matters to a head. So, figuratively   speaking, on the courthouse steps they merged.    The terms of the merger as embodied in the six-line agreement (it was   later made over into a twenty-five-page legal document which concluded   by saying that in case of dispute the six-line agreement should be the   final authority) were these: each of the old companies received a half   interest in the common stock (10,000 shares) of the new company;   15,000 shares (callable at 105) of the new company’s preferred stock   should be divided according to the assets of the old companies.   Actually, 13,979 shares of preferred were issued, the majority going   to the Morkrum group.  And so it was that the agreement to join both companies under the name Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation was consummated and chartered in the State of Delaware on December 29, 1924, with Sterling Morton as President, Howard L. Krum as Vice President in charge of manufacturing, and Edward E. Kleinschmidt as Vice President in charge of development, patents and foreign sales.  One of the first decisions to make was whether the Kleinschmidt plant in Long Island City or the Morkrum plant in Chicago would be the headquarters for the new company. The Kleinschmidt company was on a 27,000-foot leased floor in a building which R. H. Macy Company had just purchased to use for a warehouse, and negotiations had been going on for some time for the purchase of the Kleinschmidt lease—the sum of $25,000.00 having been offered. When the union of the two companies was decided upon, an agreement to vacate on the terms offered was signed, and the Kleinschmidt firm moved to the Morkrum-owned plant in Chicago.      [Illustration: Fig. 10   Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation No. 14 Start-Stop Typebar Tape Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  Bringing together the engineering talent and patents of the two companies had an immediate effect toward further progress. The first thing the new company set out to do, through consolidation of their past efforts, was to perfect a satisfactory start-stop-operated tape printer for the Western Union Telegraph Company to use for circuit extension to customers who were extensively using the telegraph for immediate, written communication. (This was to speed up telegraphic communication and eliminate the need for messenger service which had been the custom.) The Morkrum company had submitted their start-stop-operated Baudot tape printer, and the Kleinschmidt company had proposed the Western Union No. 22 tape printer in a redesign to start-stop operation. Now, the new company was able to combine both plans and as a result came up with their first development, a typebar, start-stop-operated, tape printer, the No. 14 (see figure 10). In the final design, Howard Krum and his production engineers took a large part. After tests and evaluation, Western Union’s first order was for 10,000 machines at $317.00 each. This amounted to a total of $3,170,000.00. No such quantity had ever been heard of before!  It is quite evident that while the two companies were separated, each coming up with improved and new designs of telegraph apparatus, there was a lack of decision by telegraph companies as to which type of apparatus to adopt in expanding their operations, and therefore they did not buy in quantity. The largest previous order to the Kleinschmidt Electric Company was for 800 No. 22 typebar tape printers for the Western Union Multiplex.  At Morkrum-Kleinschmidt more space was needed. The corner property on Wrightwood Avenue adjoining the Morkrum plant was purchased, and a four-story building was erected.  The design of a telegraph typewriter that would be more efficient and require a minimum of maintenance service was the most important project, and Morkrum-Kleinschmidt was working with Bell Laboratories engineers endeavoring to meet all the requirements of the Bell Telephone system. A typebar printer with a stationary printing platen and moving typebar printing unit was specified. These requirements were finally met with the design of the No. 15 page"]]]
