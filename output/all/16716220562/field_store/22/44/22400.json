The 3B thereafter became standard apparatus and additional orders were placed as the multiplex system at Western Union expanded (see figure 2).  Several years later, Western Union efficiency engineers found that, due to circuit failures, certain parts of messages would have to be repeated. Because this meant retyping the message, they felt, and for other reasons as well, that printing the received messages on tape would be more economical, since corrections could be inserted without repeating the entire message. To meet this requirement, the typebar page printer was redesigned for printing on tape. This was accomplished by using the same selection controls and operating the typebars to print downward on the tape instead of upward against the platen as in the page printer. A tape gummer to attach the tape to a message blank was also designed. The 21A, later No. 22, tape printer was ordered in quantity thereafter.  Seeing the possibility of using their typebar page printer for direct-line service, the Kleinschmidt company built a motor-driven send-receive unit having a single contact transmitter which operated under control of a code-perforated tape to transmit seven signals in succession: one start, five code, and a stop signal. The receiving unit had a seven-segment commutator, one segment for start, five for code, and one for stop, and a rotating brush to pick up and transmit the received code signals to the printing unit. This apparatus was installed at the United Press for news distribution to their connected newspapers. Another set was installed at the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for station communications, and still another in New York City at the Equitable Life Assurance Society between their downtown and uptown offices. In connection with the latter installation, the Equitable people asked permission to install the printing apparatus on the telephone line and there was objection from the telephone company. However, after some consideration they finally agreed that the apparatus could be installed but warning that should it create interference with the telephone line it would be removed immediately. As it turned out, the printer operation over this telephone circuit did not create any interference and the apparatus remained in service a long time (figure 3 ).      [Illustration: Fig. 3                        Kleinschmidt Electric Company              Teletypewriter Apparatus for Direct-Line Service]  The Kleinschmidt Electric Company now began to have financial difficulties. Edward Kleinschmidt was borrowing wherever he could. There was no large quantity production and evidently his charges for the apparatus delivered were too low. At any rate, early in 1917, Mr. Seely suggested that he get financial help to carry on and it was here that the following gentlemen entered the picture: Charles B. Goodspeed of the Buckeye Steel Casting Company; Paul M. Benedict, assistant to the president of the C. B. & Q.; Edward Moore, son of Judge Moore of the American Can Company; Eldon Bisbee, a New York lawyer; and one of Mr. Bisbee’s clients, Albert Henry Wiggen, who was then president of the Chase National Bank. With their financial backing, the company was able to continue with further developmental work on simplified and more efficient apparatus. Orders for various types of equipment for the Western Union Multiplex and for the Morse code keyboard perforator came along, but developmental costs were high and still more capital investment was required; Kleinschmidt would then borrow from the Chase Bank. Every so often at the Kleinschmidt company’s directors’ meetings, Mr. Holly, cashier of the bank and also a director of the company, would state that the Kleinschmidt loan “stood out like a lighthouse,” so a vote for an additional stock issue was carried and the loan paid.  Along about 1919 the Kleinschmidt company had completed a satisfactory keyboard-operated typebar teleprinter for intercommunication systems (see figure 4). The Kleinschmidt Telegraph Typewriter, as it was called, was installed at the New York City News, the Panama Canal, and at the Brooklyn Union Gas Company (fig. 5).  In 1922, Edward Kleinschmidt, having learned that Mr. J. E. Wright had discontinued further developments in the telegraph field, proposed the purchase of his patents, stating that this acquisition would broaden the Kleinschmidt company’s patent situation. The proposal was carried, and, after negotiations, Mr. Wright’s patents were bought for 100 shares of the Kleinschmidt Electric Company’s common stock.  In 1923, the Kleinschmidt Telegraph Typewriter was exhibited at the 20th Annual Business Show in New York and created a great deal of interest. In 1924, a complete telegraph system was engineered and set up for the Mexican government. (An engineer from Western Union was borrowed to help with this job.)  One day, in 1923, after some correspondence with Samuel Samuel & Co., Ltd., through whom the Kleinschmidt company received orders from Japan for the Morse code keyboard perforator, the Japanese Telegraph Administration sent one of their telegraph engineers, Mr. Y. Okomoto, to the company’s headquarters to assist in working out a keyboard arrangement of Japanese characters for a simplified alphabet consisting of 88 characters which the Japanese Telegraph Administration had devised. The five-unit code could not be used since only 64 selective positions could be had. So the telegraph typewriter mechanisms were changed to six-unit-code operation, which worked out very well. The Kleinschmidt company, and later Morkrum-Kleinschmidt, received continuing orders for the six-unit-code telegraph typewriters.

Krum, the vice president of the firm, entered the telegraph field quite by accident. A young electrical engineer named Frank Pearne, in 1902, had some ideas for a printing telegraph machine and needed financial backing to carry on his experiments. One of his contacts happened to be Joy Morton, the founder of the Morton Salt Company. Joy Morton became interested enough to become Pearne’s backer, and prevailed upon brother Mark to set up a laboratory in the attic of the cold-storage plant for Pearne’s experiments.  It seems that after a year or so, Pearne lost interest in his invention and went into the teaching field. He proved to be a very successful professor at Armour Tech where he remained until his death.[3] But Pearne’s work was not in vain, for Charles L. Krum had become intensely interested and carried on the work with further inventions of his own. Indeed, he filed his first patent application on August 20, 1903, which proposed the use of a code comprising four signals: a positive pulse or a negative pulse of low voltage, and a positive or negative pulse of a higher voltage. Four additional patents were filed, the last in 1906.  C. L. Krum then set about building a machine which was demonstrated in 1906 and looked promising enough to form a company to further develop it. This company was made up of the Mortons (brothers Joy and Mark) and the Krums (Charles L. and his son Howard who had just finished college). The combination of their names, of course, resulted in “The Morkrum Company,” which was incorporated in the State of Maine on October 7, 1907. The charter stockholders were Joy Morton, who shouldered the greatest financial burden; Charles Krum; Joy Morton’s secretary, Daniel Peterkin (he later became an officer of the Morkrum Company); Mark Morton; and Sterling Morton (Joy’s son, of whom we shall be hearing more later on). The working capital of the new company amounted to $150,000.00.  Charles Krum’s son Howard, after graduation, joined with his father in the developmental work of this new company and, due to his studies in electrical engineering, was able to help his father considerably. His first love and intended career was music, but he put this aside in favor of his father’s telegraph printer. However, a tune on the piano which he always kept in the laboratory would help him solve many a difficult problem.  In 1908 the Krums developed and produced a working model of the four-unit-code, plus-minus, high-low-voltage system, which was applied to operate the mechanism of an Oliver typewriter. The system was then given an operative test on the wires of the Chicago and Alton Railroad, of which Joy Morton was a director.  As their research work progressed, Howard studied the various systems in current use and, with his father, decided to abandon the plus-minus, high-low-voltage system. They turned instead to a system using the five-unit permutation code as employed by Baudot in his multiplex telegraph in which synchronized terminal apparatus with periodic correction was the controlling feature.  Their first joint patent describes a plan for accomplishing synchronized reception with transmission using a system of five relays interconnected to operate in successive cascade form; thus, when the relays at both terminals are correctly timed for successive operation, they will transmit and receive the five pulse combinations of the Baudot code. For transmitting and receiving the code pulses, each of the five relays has an additional contact. To start the relay cascade operation, a start relay is added at both terminals and operated by a start pulse which precedes each code transmission. It seemed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53481"],["title","Printing Telegraphy... A New Era Begins (#4)"],["body","for the Krums to turn to a relay system at first, since, from his work with the three-unit-code, high-low-voltage system, C. L. Krum was experienced with the possibilities of relay operation.  The system of the relay chain in cascade operation was employed to operate a page printer using the mechanisms of the Blickensdoerfer typewriter which had a three-row typewheel. The Postal Telegraph Company became interested and bought a number of these printers in 1910. This was the first sale of Morkrum apparatus and provided enthusiasm for the Krums for further research, which led to the substitution of a governed-motor-driven brush distributor to replace the relay cascade system. For this new plan the motor at the receiving printer operated at a slightly higher speed and was held in continuously synchronous operation with the transmitter by the periodic transmission of a correcting pulse. The new code selecting and printer control system was also adapted to operate the mechanism of the Blickensdoerfer typewheel typewriter. The idea worked out better than the cascade relay system, and a number of printers using this method were constructed and named the “Morkrum Blue Code.” A few were put in service at the Postal Telegraph Company.  The Associated Press (AP) became interested in the Morkrum “Blue Code” printer system as a replacement for the low-speed Morse system which was being used to transmit news items to newspapers in many cities. Here, continuous transmission under control of a code-punched tape, as used in the Morse code system, was a requirement, so Messrs. Krum set to work and designed a keyboard-operated, five-unit, Baudot-code perforator and an automatic punched-tape-controlled transmitter. This apparatus was installed at the New York headquarters in 1915 and receiving printers were gradually installed throughout the Associated Press system. The following excerpt and picture (fig. 6) from Oliver Gramling’s book, _AP—The Story of News_,[4] describes the introduction of the system to the Associated Press:    The tide of news by telegraph had continued with the years. Facilities   had been improved, the Morse clicked into virtually every town in the   country, but the old method was the same. Day in and day out, sending   operators took dispatches, translated them into the dash-dot of code,   and the telegraph keys sent the signals on the circuits at a rate of   twenty-five to thirty-five words a minute. In member newspaper offices   along the line the Morse sounders clack-clacked busily and receiving   operators translated the code symbols back into words, copying the   stories in jerky spurts. The news of more than half a century had been   handled that way.    For some time, however, Charles L. Krum, a Chicago cold-storage   engineer, and his son Howard had been working to perfect an automatic   machine which would send the printed word by wire at greater speed   without the intermediary of code. They called their invention the   Morkrum Telegraph Printer—coining the word Morkrum by combining the   inventor’s name with the first syllable in the last name of Joy   Morton, a Chicago businessman who financed them.      [Illustration: Fig. 6       A SENDING OPERATOR SAT AT A KEYBOARD LIKE THAT OF A TYPEWRITER.      Reproduced from _AP—The Story of News_, by permission of Associated                                                                  Press.]    Several other automatic telegraphic devices were being promoted, but   (Kent) Cooper and engineers in the Traffic Department decided Krum’s   machine held the most promise for their purposes. Tests got under way.   In the Associated Press headquarters, which had been moved seven   blocks from the old Western Union building to 51 Chambers Street, a   sending operator sat at a keyboard similar to that of an ordinary   typewriter. As he struck the keys, copying the dispatches before him,   the machine perforated a paper tape with a series of holes, each   combination representing a letter. The tape fed into a box-like   transmitter which transformed the tape perforations into electrical   impulses and sent them along the wires into the receiving machines in   newspaper offices. These impulses actuated telegraph relays and set   the receiving Morkrum machines automatically reproducing the letters   which the sending operators were typing miles away.    The tests demonstrated that the Morkrum could transmit news hour after   hour at the rate of sixty words a minute and the copy was delivered   clean and uniform. Thus began the slow extension of Morkrum   transmission to the whole leased wire system, replacing the “brass   pounding” Morse keys. It was a transition that required years and   until it was completed both Morse and Morkrum worked side by side in   many places.  An interesting story appeared recently in “The AP World,”[5] giving some recollections of AP’s first field maintenance man, Royal (Roy) Bailey, then aged 71 and living in retirement in California. He still remembers the AP’s first printing telegraph machines, the article says; in fact, he helped make them, for he was a mechanic in the Morkrum Company’s factory in Chicago. When the Morkrum Company shipped the first machines to AP headquarters, Bailey went along with the machines to install and maintain them, although he remained on the Morkrum Company’s payroll. He eventually installed AP printers all over New York City and Connecticut, in Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and in Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. He recalls that Morse telegraphers “used to groan when they first saw him.” The early teleprinters were hard to keep synchronized, Bailey further recalls, and copy boys had to check the speed frequently by sighting the striped motor flywheel through a tuning fork. (Many of those copy boys, he says, including Mickey Burt and Henry Elling, became AP engineers.)  As the experimental and developmental work continued at the Morkrum plant, Howard Krum studied all types of start-stop systems and found that synchronous control was the basis of all systems. After experimenting with various ideas his thoughts turned to a plan to make the start of the receiving unit somewhat independent of the transmitting unit start, thus avoiding irregularities then present in transmitter start devices. This idea led to the construction of a permutation-code, start-stop system, using segmented commutators with rotating brush distributors at both transmitting and receiving units and a start magnet for each to control start-stop operation.  In this system the transmitter start magnet, when energized, releases the transmitting brush, which immediately contacts the first segment to transmit a start pulse to operate the receiver start magnet; the five-unit-code signal combination follows and both transmitting and receiving units are stopped. The apparatus was applied to control the selecting and printing mechanism of the Blickensdoerfer typewheel typewriter and named the “Morkrum Green Code.” This improved apparatus soon replaced the Blue Code printer at Associated Press and other installations (see figs. 7 and 7A).  In this connection the following additional comments of Mr. Bailey may be of interest:[6]    In 1919 I installed the New York-Washington circuit, with drops at   Philadelphia and Baltimore. This was a new type of printer using what   we called the Green Code. This was considered an improvement over the   old Blue Code, which meant a rearrangement of the receiving mechanism,   but still the machines made use of a typewheel....    Our biggest job of all came in 1923 when we changed over all the old   Blue Code typewheel printers in the New York area to the new style L.   C. Smith typebar printers using Green Code. (Morkrum bought L. C.   Smith typewriters and added new machinery to them. Those printers   became the famous Model 12.)  As we have seen, a number of inventors had patented ways and means to adopt the five-unit code for operating a telegraph printer system by the transmission of a start pulse to start both transmitting apparatus and the distant receiving apparatus at the same time, followed by transmission of a selected code and a stop pulse. To achieve successful operation, very close speed adjustment was required. At first, this was achieved by the use of governed motors and, later, when accurately timed, 60-cycle alternating current became available, the problem of synchronous operation of send and receive stations was solved by the use of synchronous motors.      [Illustration: Fig. 7              Morkrum Company’s Blue Code Typewheel Page Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]      [Illustration: Fig. 7A             Morkrum Company’s Green Code Typewheel Page Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  Telegraph printer systems of this type were used by telegraph companies for city-to-city transmission of telegrams and by news-gathering and -distributing organizations to transmit the news from headquarters to newspapers in different cities. While start-stop systems of this type were used successfully on press circuits and on telegraph message station-to-station circuitry, trouble was experienced when a number of printer send-receive units were set up in an intercommunicating system. Here it was found that the receiver start was not always in time with the transmitter start, due to varying line circuit conditions and a variation in the start release mechanism at connected stations.  It seems odd that synchronous systems, where both transmitter and receiver were started at the same time (requiring both transmitter and receiver to maintain synchronism), held the field for so long a time, thus limiting telegraph transmission to one-way operation.  It evidently took a mind not bound or hampered by the standard and accepted way of operating synchronous systems to discard such old ideas and to"]]]
