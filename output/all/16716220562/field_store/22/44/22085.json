She set it on the table at Marjorie's bedside, and Marjorie gave a scream of delight when she saw a cut-glass bowl heaped high with pink ice cream.  \"Oh, Uncle Steve!\" she cried, \"the ice cream is the 'something better,' I know it is, and those other parcels are the other three promises! Can I open them now?\"  Almost without waiting for her question to be answered, Marjorie tore off papers and strings, and found, as she fully expected, a box of chocolate creams, a box of peppermint drops, and a lovely new story book.  Then Grandma came in to their tea party and they all ate the ice cream, and Marjorie declared it was the loveliest afternoon tea she had ever attended.  Even Puff was allowed to have a small saucer of the ice cream, for she was a very dainty kitten, and her table manners were quite those of polite society.  But the next afternoon Uncle Steve was obliged to go to town, and Marjorie felt quite disconsolate at the loss of the jolly afternoon hour.  But kind-hearted Grandma planned a pleasure for her, and told her she would invite both Stella Martin and Molly to come to tea with Marjorie from four till five.  Marjorie had not seen Stella since the day they came up together on the train, and the little girls were glad to meet again. Stella and Molly were about as different as two children could be, for while Molly was headstrong, energetic, and mischievous, Stella was timid, quiet, and demure.  Both Marjorie and Molly were very quick in their actions, but Stella was naturally slow and deliberate. When they played games, Stella took as long to make her move as Molly and Midge together. This made them a little impatient, but Stella only opened her big blue eyes in wonder and said, \"I can't do things any faster.\" So they soon tired of playing games, and showed Stella their paper-dolls' houses. Here they were the surprised ones, for Stella was an adept at paper dolls and knew how to draw and cut out lovely dolls, and told Marjorie that if she had a paintbox she could paint them.  \"I wish you would come over some other day, Stella, and do it,\" said Midge; \"for I know Uncle Steve will get me a paint-box if I ask him to, and a lot of brushes, and then we can all paint. Oh, we'll have lots of fun, won't we?\"  \"Yes, thank you,\" said Stella, sedately.  Marjorie giggled outright. \"It seems so funny,\" she said, by way of explanation, \"to have you say 'yes, thank you' to us children; I only say it to grown people; don't you, Molly?\"  \"I don't say it at all,\" confessed Molly; \"I mean to, but I 'most always forget. It's awful hard for me to remember manners. But it seems to come natural to Stella.\"  Stella looked at her, but said nothing. She was a very quiet child, and somehow she exasperated Marjorie. Perhaps she would not have done so had they all been out of doors, playing together, but she sat on a chair by Marjorie's bedside with her hands folded in her lap, and her whole attitude so prim that Marjorie couldn't help thinking to herself that she'd like to stick a pin in her. Of course she wouldn't have done it, really, but Marjorie had a riotous vein of mischief in her, and had little use for excessive quietness of demeanor, except when the company of grown-ups demanded it.  But Stella seemed not at all conscious that her conduct was different from the others, and she smiled mildly at their rollicking fun, and agreed quietly to their eager enthusiasms.  At last Jane came in with the tea-tray, and the sight of the crackers and milk, the strawberries and little cakes, created a pleasant diversion.  Stella sat still in her chair, while Marjorie braced herself up on her pillows, and Molly, who was sitting on the bed, bounced up and down with glee.  Marjorie was getting much better now, so that she could sit upright and preside over the feast. She served the strawberries for her guests, and poured milk for them from the glass pitcher.  Molly and Marjorie enjoyed the good things, as they always enjoyed everything, but Stella seemed indifferent even to the delights of strawberries and cream.  She sat holding a plate in one hand, and a glass of milk in the other, and showed about as much animation as a marble statue. Even her glance was roving out of the window, and somehow the whole effect of the child was too much for Marjorie's spirit of mischief.  Suddenly, and in a loud voice, she said to Stella, \"BOO!\"  This, in itself, was not frightful, but coming so unexpectedly it startled Stella, and she involuntarily jumped, and her glass and plate fell to the floor with a crash; and strawberries, cakes, and milk fell in a scattered and somewhat unpleasant disarray.  Marjorie was horrified at what she had done, but Stella's face, as she viewed the catastrophe, was so comical that Marjorie went off into peals of laughter. Molly joined in this, and the two girls laughed until the bed shook.  Frightened and nervous at the whole affair, Stella began to cry. And curiously enough, Stella's method of weeping was as noisy as her usual manner was quiet. She cried with such loud, heart-rending sobs that the other girls were frightened into quietness again, until they caught sight of Stella's open mouth and tightly-closed but streaming eyes, when hilarity overtook them again.  Into this distracting scene, came Grandma. She stood looking in amazement at the three children and the debris on the floor.  At first Mrs. Sherwood naturally thought it an accident due to Stella's carelessness, but Marjorie instantly confessed.  \"It's my fault, Grandma,\" she said; \"I scared Stella, and she couldn't help dropping her things.\"  \"You are a naughty girl, Mischief,\" said Grandma, as she tried to comfort the weeping Stella. \"I thought you would at least be polite to your little guests, or I shouldn't have given you this tea party.\"  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Marjorie, contritely; \"please forgive me, Stella, but honestly I didn't think it would scare you so. What would YOU do, Molly, if I said 'boo' to you?\"  \"I'd say 'boo yourself'!\" returned Molly, promptly.  \"I know you would,\" said Marjorie, \"but you see Stella's different, and I ought to have remembered the difference. Don't cry, Stella; truly I'm sorry! Don't cry, and I'll give you my--my paper-doll's house.\"  This was generous on Marjorie's part, for just then her paper-doll's house was her dearest treasure.  But Stella rose to the occasion.  \"I w-wont t-take it,\" she said, still sobbing, though trying hard to control herself; \"it wasn't your fault, Marjorie; I oughtn't to have been so silly as to be scared b-because you said b-boo!\"  By this time Jane had removed all evidences of the accident, and except for a few stains on Stella's frock, everything was in order.  But Stella, though she had quite forgiven Marjorie, was upset by the whole affair, and wanted to go home.  So Grandma declared she would take the child home herself and apologize to Mrs. Martin for Marjorie's rudeness.  \"It was rude, Marjorie,\" she said, as she went away; \"and I think Molly must go home now, and leave you to do a little thinking about your conduct to your other guest.\"  So Marjorie was left alone to think, and half an hour later Grandma returned.  \"That was a naughty trick, Marjorie, and I think you ought to be punished for it.\"  \"But, Grandma,\" argued Miss Mischief, \"I wasn't disobedient; you never told me not to say boo to anybody.\"  \"But I told you, dear, that you must use your common-sense; and you must have known that to startle Stella by a sudden scream at her was enough to make her drop whatever she was holding.\"  \"Grandma, I 'spect I was mischievous; but truly, she did look so stiff and pudgy, I just HAD to make her jump.\"  \"I know what you mean, Midge; and you have a natural love of mischief, but you must try to overcome it. I want you to grow up polite and kind, and remember those two words mean almost exactly the same thing. You knew it wasn't kind to make Stella jump, even if it hadn't caused her to upset things.\"  \"No, I know it wasn't, Grandma, and I'm sorry now. But I'll tell you what: whenever Stella comes over here again, I'll try to be SPECIALLY kind to her, to make up for saying boo!\"     CHAPTER VII  A BOAT-RIDE   Great was the rejoicing of the whole household when at last Marjorie was able to come downstairs once more.  Uncle Steve assisted her down. He didn't carry her, for he said she was far too much of a heavyweight for any such performance as that, but he supported her on one side, and with a banister rail on the other she managed beautifully.  And, anyway, her ankle was just about as well as ever. The doctor had not allowed the active child to come downstairs until there was little if any danger that an imprudence on her part might injure her again.  It was Saturday afternoon, and though she could not be allowed to walk about the place until the following week, yet Uncle Steve took her for a long, lovely drive behind Ned and Dick, and then brought her back to another jolly little surprise.  This was found in a certain sheltered corner of one of the long verandas. It was so built that it was almost like a cosy, little square room; and climbing vines formed a pleasant screen from the bright sunlight. To it Uncle Steve had brought a set of wicker furniture: dear little chairs and a table and a settee, all painted green. Then there was a green-and-white hammock swung at just the right height, and containing two or three fat, jolly-looking, green pillows, in the midst of which Puff had chosen to curl herself up for a nap.  There was a little bamboo bookcase, with a few books and papers, and a large box covered with Japanese matting, which had a hinged lid, and was lovely to keep things in. There was a rug on the floor, and Japanese lanterns hung from the ceiling, all in tones of green"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5271"],["title","Marjorie's Vacation (#8)"],["body"," white and silver.  Marjorie unceremoniously dislodged Puff from her comfortable position, and flung herself into the hammock instead.  \"Uncle Steve!\" she exclaimed, grabbing that gentleman tightly round the neck as he leaned over her to adjust her pillows, \"you are the best man in the whole world, and I think you ought to be President! If you do any more of these lovely things for me I shall just--just SUFFOCATE with joy. What makes you so good to me, anyhow?\"  \"Oh, because you're such a little saint, and never do anything naughty or mischievous!\"  \"That's a splendid reason,\" cried Marjorie, quite appreciating the joke, \"and, truly, Uncle Steve,--don't you tell,--it's a great secret: but I AM going to try to be more dignified and solemn.\"  This seemed to strike Uncle Steve as being very funny, for he sat down on the little wicker settee and laughed heartily.  \"Well, you may as well begin now, then; and put on your most dignified and pompous manner, as you lie there in that hammock, for I'm going to read to you until tea-time.\"  \"Goody, goody!\" cried Marjorie, bobbing up her curly head, and moving about excitedly. \"Please, Uncle, read from that new book you brought me last night. I'll get it!\"  \"That's a nice, dignified manner, that is! Your Serene Highness will please calm yourself, and stay just where you are. _I_ shall select the book to read from, and _I_ shall do the reading. All you have to do is to lie still and listen.\"  So Marjorie obeyed, and, of course, Uncle Steve picked out the very book she wanted, and read to her delightfully for an hour or more.  Marjorie's porch, as it came to be called, proved to be a favorite resort all summer long for the family and for any guests who came to the house. Marjorie herself almost lived in it for the first few days after she came downstairs, but at last the doctor pronounced her ankle entirely well, and said she might \"start out to find some fresh mischief.\"  So the next morning, directly after breakfast, she announced her intention of going down to see the boathouse.  \"Just think,\" she exclaimed, \"I have never seen it yet, and King told me to go down there the very first thing.\"  \"I suppose you'll come back half-drowned,\" said Grandma, \"but as you seem unable to learn anything, except by mistakes, go ahead. But, Marjorie, do try not to do some absurd thing, and then say that I haven't forbidden it! I don't forbid you to go in the boat, if Carter goes with you, but I do forbid you to go alone. Will you remember that?\"  \"Yes, Grandma, truly I will,\" said Marjorie, with such a seraphic smile that her grandmother kissed her at once.  \"Then run along and have a good time; and don't jump off the dock or anything foolish.\"  \"I won't,\" cried Marjorie, gayly; and then she went dancing down the path to the garden. Carter was in the greenhouse potting some plants.  \"Carter,\" said Marjorie, putting her head in at the door, \"are you very busy?\"  \"Busy, indeed! I have enough work here with these pesky plants to keep me steady at it till summer after next. Busy, is it? I'm so busy that the bees and the ants is idle beside me. Busy? Well, I AM busy!\"  But as the good-natured old man watched Marjorie's face, and saw the look of disappointment settling upon it, he said: \"But what matters that? If so be, Miss Midget, I can do anything for you, you've only to command.\"  \"Well, Carter, I thought this morning I'd like to go down to see the boathouse; and I thought, perhaps,--maybe, if you weren't busy, you might take me for a little row in the boat. Just a little row, you know--not very far.\"  It would have taken a harder heart than Carter's to withstand the pleading tones and the expectant little face; and the gardener set down his flower-pots, and laid down his trowel at once.  \"Did your grandmother say you could go, Miss Midget?\"  \"She said I could go if you went with me.\"  \"Then it's with ye I go, and we'll start at once.\"  Marjorie danced along by the side of the old man as he walked more slowly down the garden path, when suddenly a new idea came into her head.  \"Oh, Carter,\" she cried, \"have my seeds come up yet? And what are the flowers? Let's go and look at them.\"  \"Come up yet, is it? No, indeed, they've scarcely settled themselves down in the earth yet.\"  \"I wish they would come up, I want to see what they'll be. Let's go and look at the place where we planted them, Carter.\"  So they turned aside to the flowerbed where the precious seeds had been planted, but not even Marjorie's sharp eyes could detect the tiniest green sprout. With an impatient little sigh she turned away, and as they continued down toward the boathouse, Marjorie heard somebody calling, and Molly Moss came flying up to her, all out of breath.  \"We were so afraid we wouldn't catch you,\" she exclaimed, \"for your Grandma said you had gone out in the boat.\"  \"We haven't yet,\" answered Marjorie, \"but we're just going. Oh, Carter, can we take Molly, too?\"  \"And Stella,\" added Molly. \"She's coming along behind.\"  Sure enough, Stella was just appearing round the corner of the house, and walking as sedately as if on her way to church.  \"Hurry up, Stella,\" called Marjorie. \"Can we all go, Carter?\"  \"Yes, if yees'll set still in the boat and if the other little lady gets here before afternoon. She's the nice, quiet child, but you two are a pair of rascally babies, and I don't know whether it's safe to go on the water with ye. I'm thinkin' I'll take little Miss Stella, and leave ye two behind.\"  \"_I_ don't think you will, Carter,\" said Marjorie, not at all alarmed by the old man's threat. \"_I_ think you'll take all three of us, and we'll sit as still as mice, won't we, Molly?\"  \"Yes,\" said Molly; \"can we take off our shoes and stockings and hang our feet over the sides of the boat?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" cried Marjorie, \"that will be lots of fun!\"  \"Indeed you'll do nothing of the sort,\" and Carter's honest old face showed that he felt great anxiety concerning his madcap charges. \"Ye must promise to sit still, and not move hand or foot, or I'll go back to my work and leave yees on shore.\"  This awful suggestion brought about promises of strictly good behavior, and as Stella had arrived, the party proceeded to the boathouse.  Stella was mildly pleased at the prospect of a row, and walked demurely by Carter's side, while the other two ran on ahead and reached the boathouse first.  As the door was locked, and they could not open it, Marjorie, who was all impatience to see the boat, proposed that they climb in the window. Molly needed no second invitation, and easily slipped through the little square window, and Marjorie, with a trifle more difficulty, wriggled her own plump little body through after.  As the window was not on the side of the boathouse toward which Carter was approaching, he did not see the performance, and so when he and Stella reach the boathouse a few moments later, they could see nothing at all of the other two girls.  \"Merciful powers!\" he exclaimed. \"Whatever has become of them two witches?\"  \"Where can they be?\" cried Stella, clasping her hands, and opening her eyes wide in alarm.  Old Carter was genuinely frightened. \"Miss Marjorie!\" he called, loudly. \"Miss Molly! Where be ye?\"  Meanwhile, the two girls inside the boathouse had carefully scrambled down into the boat and sat quietly on the stern seat. There was a strong breeze blowing, and as the boat swayed up and down on the rippling water, its keel grating against the post to which it was tied, and the doors and windows being tightly shut, they did not hear Carter's voice. They really had no intention of frightening the old man, and supposed he would open the door in a moment.  But Carter's mind was so filled with the thought that the children had fallen into the water that it didn't occur to him to open the boathouse. He went to the edge of the pier, which was a narrow affair, consisting only of two wooden planks and a single hand rail, and gazed anxiously down into the water.  This gave Stella a firm conviction that the girls were drowned, and without another word she began to cry in her own noisy and tumultuous fashion. Poor Carter, already at his wits' end, had small patience with any additional worry.  \"Keep still, Miss Stella,\" he commanded; \"it's enough to have two children on me hands drowned without another one raising a hullabaloo. And it's a queer thing, too, if them wicked little rats is drownded, why they don't come up to the surface! My stars! Whatever will the Missus say? But, havin' disappeared so mortal quick, there's no place they can be but under the water. I'll get a boat-hook, and perhaps I can save 'em yet.\"  Trembling with excitement and bewildered with anxiety, so that he scarcely knew what he did, the old man fitted the key in the lock. He flung open the boathouse door and faced the two children, who sat quietly and with smiling faces in the boat.  \"Well, if ye don't beat all! Good land, Miss Marjorie, whatever did ye give me such a scare for? Sure I thought ye was drownded, and I was jest goin' to fish ye up with a boat-hook! My, but you two are terrors! And how did ye get in now? Through the keyhole, I suppose.\"  \"Why, no, Carter,\" exclaimed Marjorie, who was really surprised at the old man's evident excitement; \"we were in a hurry, and the door was locked, so we just stepped in through the window.\"  \"Stepped in through the window, is it? And if the window had been locked ye'd have jest stepped in through the chimley! And if the chimley had been locked, ye'd have stepped into the water, and ducked under, and come up through the floor! When ye're in a hurry, ye stop for nothin', Miss Midget.\"  The old man's relief at finding the children safe was so great that he was really talking a string of nonsense to hide his feelings.  But Stella, though she realized the girls were all right, could not control her own emotions so easily, and was still crying vociferously.  \"For goodness' sake!\" exclaimed Molly, \"what IS the matter with "]]]
