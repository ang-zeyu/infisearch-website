If you pull it about a little, you will find that you can separate it easily into parcels or slips running lengthways down the leg, each slip being fastened tight at either end, but loose between. Each slip is what is called =a muscle=. You will notice that many of these muscles are joined, sometimes at one end only, sometimes at both, to white or bluish white glistening cords or bands; made evidently of different material from the muscle itself. They are not soft and fleshy like the muscle, but firm and stiff. These are =tendons=. Sometimes they are broad and short, sometimes thin and long.  As you are separating these muscles from each other you will see (running down the leg between them) little white soft threads, very often branching out and getting too small to be seen. These are =nerves=. Between the muscles too are other little cords, red, or reddish black, and if you prick them, a drop or several drops of blood will ooze out. These are =veins=, and are not really cords or threads, but hollow tubes, filled with blood. Lying alongside the veins are similar small tubes, containing very little blood, or none at all. These are =arteries=. The =veins= and =arteries= together are called =blood-vessels=, and it will be easy for you to make out that the larger ones you see are really hollow tubes. Lastly, if you separate the muscles still more, you will come upon the hard =bone= in the middle of the leg, and if you look closely you will find that many of the muscles are fastened to this bone.  Now try to put back everything in its place, and you will find that though you have neither cut nor torn nor broken either muscle or blood-vessel or bone, you cannot get things back into their place again. Everything looks “messy.” This is partly because, though you have torn neither muscle nor blood-vessel, you have torn something which binds skin and muscle and fat and blood-vessels and bone all together; and if you look again you will see that between them there is a delicate stringy substance which binds and packs them all together, just as cotton-wool is used to pack up delicate toys and instruments. This stringy packing material which you have torn and spoilt is called =connective= because it connects all the parts together.  Well, then, in the leg (and it is just the same in the arm) we have skin, fat, muscle, tendons, blood-vessels, nerves, and bone all packed together with connective and covered with skin. These together form the solid leg. We may speak of them as =the tissues= of the leg.  =8.= If now you turn to the trunk and cut through the skin of the belly, you will first of all see muscles again, with nerves and blood-vessels as before. But when you carefully cut through the muscles (for you cannot easily separate them from each other here), you come upon something which you did not find in  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--_The Viscera of a Rabbit as seen upon simply opening the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen without any further Dissection._       _A_, cavity of the thorax, pleural cavity of either side; _B_,      diaphragm; _C_, ventricles of the heart; _D_, auricles; _E_,      pulmonary artery; _F_, aorta; _G_, lungs, collapsed, and occupying      only the back part of the chest; _H_, lateral portions of pleural      membranes; _I_, cartilage at the end of sternum; _K_, portion of      the wall of body left between thorax and abdomen; _a_, cut ends of      the ribs; _L_, the liver, in this case lying more to the left than      the right of the body; _M_, the stomach; _N_, duodenum; _O_, small      intestine; _P_, the cæcum, so largely developed in this and other      herbivorous animals; _Q_, the large intestine. ]  the leg, a =great cavity=. This is something quite new--there is nothing like it in the leg--a great cavity, quite filled with something, but still a great cavity; and if you slit the rabbit right up the front of its trunk and turn down or cut away the sides as has been done in Fig. 1, you will see that the whole trunk is =hollow= from top to bottom, from the neck to the legs.  If you look carefully you will see that the cavity is divided into two by a cross partition (Fig. 1, _B_) called the =diaphragm=. The part =below= the diaphragm is the larger of the two, and is called the =abdomen= or belly; in it you will see a large dark red mass, which is the =liver= (_L_). Near the liver is the smooth pale =stomach= (_M_), and filling up the rest of the abdomen you will see the coils of the =intestine= or bowel, very narrow in some parts (_O_), very broad (_P_ _Q_), broader even than the stomach, in others. If you pull the bowels on one side as you easily can do, you will find lying underneath them two small brownish red lumps, one on each side. These are the =kidneys=.  In the smaller cavity =above= the diaphragm, called the =thorax= or chest, you will see in the middle the =heart= (_C_), and on each side of the heart two pink bodies, which when you squeeze them feel spongy. These are the two =lungs= (_G_). You will notice that the heart and lungs do not fill up the cavity of the chest nearly so much as the liver, stomach, bowels, &c. fill up the cavity of the belly. In fact, in the chest there seems to be a large empty space. But as we shall see further on, the lungs did quite fill the chest before you opened it, but shrank up very much directly you cut into it, and so left the great space you see.  =9.= The trunk then is really a great chamber containing what are called the =viscera=, and divided into an upper and lower half, the upper half being filled with the heart and lungs, the lower with the liver, stomach, bowels, and some other organs. In front the abdomen is covered by skin and muscle only. But if all the sides of the trunk were made of such soft material it would be then a mere bag which could never keep its shape unless it were stuffed quite full. Some part of it must be strengthened and stiffened. And indeed the trunk is not a bag with soft yielding sides, but a box with walls which are in part firm and hard. You noticed that when you were cutting through the front of the chest you had to cut through several hard places. These were the =ribs= (Fig. 1, _a_), made either of hard bone or of a softer gristly substance called =cartilage=. And if you take away all the viscera from the cavity of the trunk and pass your finger along the back of the cavity, you will feel all the way down from the neck to the legs a hard part. This is the =backbone= or =vertebral column=. When you want to make a straw man stand upright you run a pole right through him to give him support. Such a support is the backbone to your own body, keeping the trunk from falling together.  In the abdomen nothing more is wanted than this backbone, the sides and front of the cavity being covered in with skin and muscle only. In the chest the sides are strengthened by the ribs, long thin hoops of bone which are fastened to the backbone behind and meet in front in a firm hard part, partly bone, partly cartilage, called the =sternum=.  But this backbone is not made of one long straight piece of bone. If it were you would never be able to bend your body. To enable you to do this it is made up of ever so many little flat round pieces of bone, laid one a-top of the other, with their flat sides carefully joined together, like so many bungs stuck together. Each of these little round flat pieces of the backbone is called a =vertebra=, and is of a very peculiar shape. Suppose you took a bung of bone, and fastened on to one side of its edge a ring of bone. That would represent a vertebra. The solid bung is what is called the =body=, and the hollow ring is what is called the =arch= of the vertebra. Now if you put a number of these bodies together one upon the top of the other, so that the bodies all came together and the rings all came together, you would have something very like the vertebral column (see Frontispiece, also Fig. 2). The bungs or bodies would make a solid jointed pillar, and the rings or arches would make together a tunnel or canal. And that is really what you have in the backbone. Only each vertebra is not exactly shaped like a bung and a ring; the body is very like a bung, but the arch is rough and jagged, and the bodies are joined together in a particular way. Still we have all the bodies of the vertebræ forming together a solid pillar which gives support to the trunk; and the arches forming together a tunnel or canal which is called the =spinal canal=, (Fig. 2, _C.S._) the use of which we shall see  [Illustration: FIG. 2.       A, a diagrammatic view of the human body cut in half lengthways.      _C.S._, the cavity of the brain and spinal cord; _N_, that of the      nose; _M_, that of the mouth; _Al. Al._, the alimentary canal      represented as a simple straight tube; _H_, the heart; _D_, the      diaphragm.       B, a transverse vertical section of the head taken along the line      _a b_; letters as before.       C, a transverse section taken along the line _c d_; letters as      before. ]  directly. The round flat body of each vertebra is turned to the front towards the cavity of the trunk, and it is the row of vertebral bodies which you feel as a hard ridge when you pass your fingers down the back of the abdomen. The arches are at the back of the bodies, so you cannot feel them in the abdomen; but if you turn the rabbit on its belly and pass your finger down its back, you will feel through the skin (and you can feel the same on your own body) a sharp edge, formed by what are called the spines, _i.e._ the uneven tips of the arches of the vertebræ (Fig. 2) all the way down the back.  So that what we really have in the trunk is this. In front a large cavity, containing the viscera, and surrounded in the upper part or thorax by hoops of bone, but not (or only slightly) in the lower part or abdomen; behind, a much smaller long narrow cavity or canal formed by the arches of the vertebræ, and therefore surrounded by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53347"],["title","Physiology (#3)"],["body","all the way along, and containing we shall presently see what; and between these two cavities, separating the one from the other, a solid pillar formed by the bodies of the vertebræ. So that if you were to take a cross slice, or transverse section as it is called, of the rabbit across the chest, you would get something like what is represented in Fig. 2, C, where _C.S._ is the narrow canal of the arches and where the broad cavity of the chest containing the heart _H_ is enclosed in the ribs reaching from the vertebra behind to the sternum in front. Both cavities are covered up on the outside with muscles, blood-vessels, nerves, connective, and skin, just as in the leg.  =10.= We have now to consider the =head and neck=. If you cut through the skin of the neck of the rabbit, you will see, first of all, muscles and nerves, and several large blood-vessels; but you will find no large cavity like that in the trunk. So far the neck is just like the leg. But if you look carefully you will see two tubes which are not blood-vessels, and the like of which you saw nowhere in the leg. One of these tubes is firm, with hardish rings in it; it is the windpipe or =trachea=; the other is soft, and its sides fall flat together; this is the gullet or =œsophagus=, leading from the mouth to the stomach. Behind these and the muscles in which they run you will find, just as in the trunk, a vertebral column, without ribs, but composed of bodies, and behind the bodies there is a vertebral canal. This vertebral column and vertebral canal in the neck are simply continuations of the vertebral column and canal of the trunk.  =The neck, then, differs from the leg in having a vertebral column and canal with a trachea and œsophagus, and differs from the trunk in having no cavity and no ribs.=  The head, again, is unlike all these. Indeed, you will not understand how the head is made unless you take a rabbit’s skull and place it side by side with the rabbit’s head. If you do this, you will at once see how the mouth and throat are formed. =You will notice that the skull is all in one piece=, except a bone which you will at once recognize as the jawbone, or, to speak more correctly, the lower =jawbone=; for there are two jawbones. Both these carry teeth, but the upper one is simply part of the skull, and does not move; the lower one does move; it can be made to shut close on the upper jaw, or can be separated a good way from it. The opening between the two jaws is the gap or gape of the mouth, which as you know can be opened or shut at pleasure. If you try it on yourself you will find that, as in the rabbit, it is the lower jaw which moves when you open or shut your mouth. The upper jaw does not move at all except when your whole head moves. Underneath the skull at the top of the neck the mouth narrows into the throat, into the upper part of which the cavity of the nose opens. So that there are two ways into the throat, one through the mouth and the other through the nose (Fig. 2).  At the back of the skull you will see a rounded opening, and if you put a bodkin through this opening you will find it leads into a large hollow space in the inside of the skull. In the living rabbit this hollow space is filled up with the =brain=. The skull, in fact, is a box of bone to hold the brain, a bony brain-case. This bony case fits on to the top of the vertebræ of the neck in such a way that the rounded opening we spoke of just now is placed exactly over the top of the tunnel or canal formed by the rings or arches of the vertebræ. If you were to put a wire through the arch of the lowest vertebra, you might push it up through the canal formed by the arches of all the vertebræ, right into the brain cavity. In fact the brain-case and the row of arches of the vertebræ form together one canal, which is a narrow tube in the back and in the neck, but swells out in the head into a wide rounded space (Fig. 2, A and B, _C.S._) During life this canal is filled with a peculiar white delicate material, which is called =nervous matter=. The rounded mass of this material which fills up the cavity of the skull is called the =brain=; the narrower, rod-like, or band-like mass which runs down the vertebral canal in the neck and back is called the =spinal cord=. They have separate names, but they are quite joined together, and the rounded brain tapers off into the band-like cord in such a way that it is difficult to say where the one begins and the other ends.  =11.= In the skull, besides the larger openings we have spoken of, you will find several small holes leading from the outside of the skull into the inside of the brain-case. Some of these holes are filled up during life by blood-vessels, but in others run those delicate white threads or cords which you have already learnt to call nerves. =Nerves are in fact branches of nervous material running out from the brain or spinal cord.= Those from the brain pass through holes in the skull, and at first sight seem to spread out very irregularly. Those which branch off from the spinal cord are far more regular. A nerve runs out on each side between every two vertebræ, little rounded gaps being left for that purpose where the vertebræ fit together, so that when you look at a spinal cord with portions of the nerves still connected with it, it seems not unlike a double comb with a row of teeth on either side. The nerves which spring in this way from the spinal cord are called =spinal nerves=, and soon after they leave the vertebral canal they divide into branches, and so are spread nearly all over the body. In any piece of skin or flesh you examine, never mind in what part of the body, you will find nerves and blood-vessels. If you trace the nerves out in one direction, you will find them joining together to form larger nerves, and these again joining others, till at last all end in either the spinal cord or the brain. If you try to trace the same nerves in the other direction, you will find them branching into smaller and smaller nerves, until they become too small to be seen. If you take a microscope you will find they get still smaller and smaller until they become the very finest possible threads.  The blood-vessels in a similar way join together into larger and larger tubes, which last all end, as we shall see, in the heart. =Every part of the body, with some few exceptions, is crowded with nerves and blood-vessels. The nerves all come from the brain or spinal cord--the vessels from the heart. So that every part of the body is governed by two centres, the heart, and the brain or spinal cord.= You will see how important it is to remember this when we get on a little further in our studies.  =12.= Well, then, the body is made up in this way. First there is the head. In this is the skull covered with skin and flesh, and containing the brain. The skull rests on the top of the backbone, where the head joins the neck. In the upper part of the neck, the throat divides into two pipes or tubes--one the windpipe, the other the gullet. These running down the neck in front of the vertebral column, covered up by many muscles, when they get about as far down as the level of the shoulders, pass into the great cavity of the body, and first into the upper part of it, or chest.  Here the windpipe ends in the lungs, but the gullet runs straight through the chest, lying close at the back on the backbone, and passes through a hole in the diaphragm into the abdomen, where it swells out into the stomach. Then it narrows again into the intestine, and after winding about inside the cavity of the abdomen a good deal, finally leaves it.  You see the =alimentary canal= (for that is the name given to this long tube made up of gullet, stomach, intestine, &c.) =goes right through the cavity of the body without opening into it=--very much as the tall narrow glass of a lamp passes through the large globe glass. You might pour anything down the narrow glass without its going into the globe glass, and you might fill the globe glass and yet leave the narrow glass quite empty. If you imagine both glasses soft and flexible instead of hard and stiff, and suppose the narrow glass to be very long and twisted about so as to all but fill the globe, you will have a very fair idea of how the alimentary canal is placed in the cavity of the body.  Besides the alimentary canal, there is in the chest, in addition to the windpipe and lungs, the heart with its great tubes, and in the abdomen there are the liver, the kidneys, and other organs.  These two great cavities, with all that is inside them, together with wrappings of flesh and skin which make up the walls of the cavities, form the trunk, and on to the trunk are fastened the jointed legs and arms. These have no large cavities, and the alimentary canal goes nowhere near them.  One more thing you have to note. There is only one alimentary canal, one liver, one heart--but there are two kidneys and two lungs, the one on one side, the other on the other, and the one very much like the other. There are two arms and two legs, the one almost exactly like the other. There is only one head, but one side of the head is almost exactly like the other. One side of the vertebral column is exactly like the other--as are also the two halves of the brain and the two halves of the spinal cord.  In fact, if you were to cut your rabbit in half from his nose to his tail, you would find that except for his alimentary canal, his heart, and his liver, one half was almost exactly the counterpart of the other.  Such is the structure of a rabbit, and your own body, in all the points I have mentioned, is made up exactly in the same way.     WHAT TAKES PLACE WHEN WE MOVE. § III.   =13.= Let us now go back to the question. =How is it that we can move about as we do?= And first of all let us take one particular movement and see if we can understand that.  For instance, you can bend your arm. You know that when your arm is lying flat on the table,"]]]
