That's enough for a gentleman.\"  \"Pooh!\" exclaimed his cousin, \"this isn't a cotton plantation. Aunt Lillian doesn't farm for money. If she did, you would have to check your extravagances mighty quick, sir.\"  \"I look after Pompey's reports, I do as much work as my ancestors,\" answered Clarence, hotly.  \"Ah, that is the trouble,\" said Virginia.  \"What do you mean?\" her cousin demanded.  \"We have been gentlemen too long,\" said Virginia.  The boy straightened up and rose. The pride and wilfulness of generations was indeed in his handsome face. And something else went with it. Around the mouth a grave tinge of indulgence.  \"What has your life been?\" she went on, speaking rapidly. \"A mixture of gamecocks and ponies and race horses and billiards, and idleness at the Virginia Springs, and fighting with other boys. What do you know? You wouldn't go to college. You wouldn't study law. You can't write a decent letter. You don't know anything about the history of your country. What can you do--?\"  \"I can ride and fight,\" he said. \"I can go to New Orleans to-morrow to join Walker's Nicaragua expedition. We've got to beat the Yankees, --they'll have Kansas away from us before we know it.\"  Virginia's eye flashed appreciation.  \"Do you remember, Jinny,\" he cried, \"one day long ago when those Dutch ruffians were teasing you and Anne on the road, and Bert Russell and Jack and I came along? We whipped 'em, Jinny. And my eye was closed. And you were bathing it here, and one of my buttons was gone. And you counted the rest.\"  \"Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,\" she recited, laughing. She crossed over and sat beside him, and her tone changed. \"Max, can't you understand? It isn't that. Max, if you would only work at something. That is why the Yankees beat us. If you would learn to weld iron, or to build bridges, or railroads. Or if you would learn business, and go to work in Pa's store.\"  \"You do not care for me as I am?\"  \"I knew that you did not understand,\" she answered passionately. \"It is because I care for you that I wish to make you great. You care too much for a good time, for horses, Max. You love the South, but you think too little how she is to be saved. If war is to come, we shall want men like that Captain Robert Lee who was here. A man who can turn the forces of the earth to his own purposes.\"  For a moment Clarence was moodily silent.  \"I have always intended to go into politics, after Pa's example,\" he said at length.  \"Then--\" began Virginia, and paused.  \"Then--?\" he said.  \"Then--you must study law.\"  He gave her the one keen look. And she met it, with her lips tightly pressed together. Then he smiled.  \"Virginia, you will never forgive that Yankee, Brice.\"  \"I shall never forgive any Yankee,\" she retorted quickly. \"But we are not talking about him. I am thinking of the South, and of you.\"  He stooped toward her face, but she avoided him and went back to the bench.  \"Why not?\" he said.  \"You must prove first that you are a man,\" she said.  For years he remembered the scene. The vineyard, the yellow stubble; and the river rushing on and on with tranquil power, and the slow panting of the steamboat. A doe ran out of the forest, and paused, her head raised, not twenty feet away.  \"And then you will marry me, Jinny?\" he asked finally.  \"Before you may hope to control another, we shall see whether you can control yourself, sir.\"  \"But it has all been arranged,\" he exclaimed, \"since we played here together years ago!\"  \"No one shall arrange that for me,\" replied Virginia promptly. \"And I should think that you would wish to have some of the credit for yourself.\"  \"Jinny!\"  Again she avoided him by leaping the low railing. The doe fled into the forest, whistling fearfully. Virginia waved her hand to him and started toward the house. At the corner of the porch she ran into her aunt Mrs. Colfax was a beautiful woman. Beautiful when Addison Colfax married her in Kentucky at nineteen, beautiful still at three and forty. This, I am aware, is a bald statement. \"Prove it,\" you say. \"We do not believe it. It was told you by some old beau who lives upon the memory of the past.\"  Ladies, a score of different daguerrotypes of Lillian Colfax are in existence. And whatever may be said of portraits, daguerrotypes do not flatter. All the town admitted that she was beautiful. All the town knew that she was the daughter of old Judge Colfax's overseer at Halcyondale. If she had not been beautiful, Addison Colfax would not have run away with her. That is certain. He left her a rich widow at five and twenty, mistress of the country place he had bought on the Bellefontaine Road, near St. Louis. And when Mrs. Colfax was not dancing off to the Virginia watering-places, Bellegarde was a gay house.  \"Jinny,\" exclaimed her aunt, \"how you scared me! What on earth is the matter?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Virginia  \"She refused to kiss me,\" put in Clarence, half in play, half in resentment.  Mrs. Colfax laughed musically. She put one of her white hands on each of her niece's cheeks, kissed her, and then gazed into her face until Virginia reddened.  \"Law, Jinny, you're quite pretty,\" said her aunt  \"I hadn't realized it--but you must take care of your complexion. You're horribly sunburned, and you let your hair blow all over your face. It's barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride. Your Pa doesn't look after you properly. I would ask you to stay to the dance to-night if your skin were only white, instead of red. You're old enough to know better, Virginia. Mr. Vance was to have driven out for dinner. Have you seen him, Clarence?\"  \"No, mother.\"  \"He is so amusing,\" Mrs. Colfax continued, \"and he generally brings candy. I shall die of the blues before supper.\" She sat down with a grand air at the head of the table, while Alfred took the lid from the silver soup-tureen in front of her. \"Jinny, can't you say something bright? Do I have to listen to Clarence's horse talk for another hour? Tell me some gossip. Will you have some gumbo soup?\"  \"Why do you listen to Clarence's horse talk?\" said Virginia. \"Why don't you make him go to work!\"  \"Mercy!\" said Mrs. Colfax, laughing, \"what could he do?\"  \"That's just it,\" said Virginia. \"He hasn't a serious interest in life.\"  Clarence looked sullen. And his mother, as usual, took his side.  \"What put that into your head, Jinny,\" she said. \"He has the place here to look after, a very gentlemanly occupation. That's what they do in Virginia.\"  \"Yes,\" said Virginia, scornfully, \"we're all gentlemen in the South. What do we know about business and developing the resources of the country? Not THAT.\"  \"You make my head ache, my dear,\" was her aunt's reply. \"Where did you get all this?\"  \"You ask me because I am a girl,\" said Virginia. \"You believe that women were made to look at, and to play with,--not to think. But if we are going to get ahead of the Yankees, we shall have to think. It was all very well to be a gentleman in the days of my great-grandfather. But now we have railroads and steamboats. And who builds them? The Yankees. We of the South think of our ancestors, and drift deeper and deeper into debt. We know how to fight, and we know how to command. But we have been ruined by--\" here she glanced at the retreating form of Alfred, and lowered her voice, \"by niggers.\"  Mrs. Colfax's gaze rested languidly on her niece's faces which glowed with indignation.  \"You get this terrible habit of argument from Comyn,\" she said. \"He ought to send you to boarding-school. How mean of Mr. Vance not to come! You've been talking with that old reprobate Whipple. Why does Comyn put up with him?\"  \"He isn't an old reprobate,\" said Virginia, warmly.  \"You really ought to go to school,\" said her aunt. \"Don't be eccentric. It isn't fashionable. I suppose you wish Clarence to go into a factory.\"  \"If I were a man,\" said Virginia, \"and going into a factory would teach me how to make a locomotive or a cotton press, or to build a bridge, I should go into a factory. We shall never beat the Yankees until we meet them on their own ground.\"  \"There is Mr. Vance now,\" said Mrs. Colfax, and added fervently, \"Thank the Lord!\"     CHAPTER IX  A QUIET SUNDAY IN LOCUST STREET  IF the truth were known where Virginia got the opinions which she expressed so freely to her aunt and cousin, it was from Colonel Carvel himself. The Colonel would rather have denounced the Dred Scott decision than admit to Judge Whipple that one of the greatest weaknesses of the South lay in her lack of mechanical and manufacturing ability. But he had confessed as much in private to Captain Elijah Brent. The Colonel would often sit for an hour or more, after supper, with his feet tucked up on the mantel and his hat on the back of his head, buried in thought. Then he would saunter slowly down to the Planters' House bar, which served the purposes of a club in those days, in search of an argument with other prominent citizens. The Colonel had his own particular chair in his own particular corner, which was always vacated when he came in at the door. And then he always had three fingers of the best Bourbon whiskey, no more and no less, every evening.  He never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the Planters' House bar. Judge Whipple, indeed, took his meals upstairs, but he never descended,--it was generally supposed because of the strong slavery atmosphere there. However, the Judge went periodically to his friend's for a quiet Sunday dinner (so called in derision by St. Louisans), on which occasions Virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely.  The Sunday following her ride to Bellegarde was the Judge's Sunday, Certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress. More than once had she scored a fair hit on the Judge for her father,--to the mutual delight of both"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5389"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","ntlemen. But to-day she dreaded being present at the argument. Just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine psychology best left to the reader for solution.  The argument began, as usual, with the tearing apart limb by limb of the unfortunate Franklin Pierce, by Judge Whipple.  \"What a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world,\" said the Judge. \"Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire\" (he pronounced this name with infinite scorn) \"managed by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi!\"  \"And he was well managed, sir,\" said the Colonel.  \"What a pliant tool of your Southern slaveholders! I hear that you are to give him a plantation as a reward.\"  \"No such thing, sir.\"  \"He deserves it,\" continued the Judge, with conviction. \"See the magnificent forts he permitted Davis to build up in the South, the arsenals he let him stock. The country does not realize this. But the day will, come when they will execrate Pierce before Benedict Arnold, sir. And look at the infamous Kansas-Nebraska act! That is the greatest crime, and Douglas and Pierce the greatest criminals, of the century.\"  \"Do have some more of that fried chicken, Judge,\" said Virginia.  Mr. Whipple helped himself fiercely, and the Colonel smiled.  \"You should be satisfied now,\" said he. \"Another Northern man is in the White House.\"  \"Buchanan!\" roared the Judge, with his mouth full.  \"Another traitor, sir. Another traitor worse than the first. He swallows the Dred Scott decision, and smirks. What a blot on the history of this Republic! O Lord!\" cried Mr. Whipple, \"what are we coming to? A Northern man, he could gag and bind Kansas and force her into slavery against the will of her citizens. He packs his Cabinet to support the ruffians you send over the borders. The very governors he ships out there, his henchmen, have their stomachs turned. Look at Walker, whom they are plotting against in Washington. He can't stand the smell of this Lecompton Constitution Buchanan is trying to jam down their throats. Jefferson Davis would have troops there, to be sure that it goes through, if he had his way. Can't you see how one sin leads to another, Carvel? How slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people?\"  \"It is because you won't let it alone where it belongs, sir,\" retorted the Colonel. It was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies. He talked slowly, and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent the more eager Judge from interrupting him.  \"The welfare of the whole South, as matters now stand, sir, depends upon slavery. Our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor. If you abolished that institution, Judge Whipple, you would ruin millions of your fellow-countrymen,--you would reduce sovereign states to a situation of disgraceful dependence. And all, sir,\" now he raised his voice lest the Judge break in, \"all, sir, for the sake of a low breed that ain't fit for freedom. You and I, who have the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence behind us, who are descended from a race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more, may well establish a Republic where the basis of stability is the self-control of the individual--as long as men such as you and I form its citizens. Look at the South Americans. How do Republics go there? And the minute you and I let in niggers, who haven't any more self-control than dogs, on an equal basis, with as much of a vote as you have,--niggers, sir, that have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days of Ham, --what's going to become of our Republic?\"  \"Education,\" cried the Judge.  But the word was snatched out of his mouth.  \"Education isn't a matter of one generation. No, sir, nor two, nor three, nor four. But of centuries.\"  \"Sir,\" said the Judge, \"I can point out negroes of intelligence and learning.\"  \"And I reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk English, and recite the catechism, and sing emotional hymns, if you brought over a couple of million from Africa,\" answered the Colonel, dryly, as he rose to put on his hat and light a cigar.  It was his custom to offer a cigar to the Judge, who invariably refused, and rubbed his nose with scornful violence.  Virginia, on the verge of leaving, stayed on, fascinated by the turn the argument had taken.  \"Your prejudice is hide-bound, sir,\" said Mr. Whipple.  \"No, Whipple,\" said the Colonel, \"when God washed off this wicked earth, and started new, He saw fit to put the sons of Ham in subjection. They're slaves of each other in Africa, and I reckon they're treated no better than they are here. Abuses can't be helped in any system, sir, though we are bettering them. Were the poor in London in the days of the Edwards as well off as our niggers are to-day?\"  The Judge snorted.  \"A divine institution!\" he shouted. \"A black curse! Because the world has been a wicked place of oppression since Noah's day, is that any reason why it should so continue until the day of Judgment?\"  The Colonel smiled, which was a sign that he was pleased with his argument.  \"Now, see here, Whipple,\" said he. \"If we had any guarantee that you would let us alone where we are, to manage our slaves and to cultivate our plantations, there wouldn't be any trouble. But the country keeps on growing and growing, and you're not content with half. You want everything,--all the new states must abolish slavery. And after a while you will overwhelm us, and ruin us, and make us paupers. Do you wonder that we contend for our rights, tooth and nail? They are our rights.\"  \"If it had not been for Virginia and Maryland and the South, this nation would not be in existence.\"  The Colonel laughed.  \"First rate, Jinny,\" he cried. \"That's so.\"  But the Judge was in a revery. He probably had not heard her.  \"The nation is going to the dogs,\" he said, mumbling rather to himself than to the others. \"We shall never prosper until the curse is shaken off, or wiped out in blood. It clogs our progress. Our merchant marine, of which we were so proud, has been annihilated by these continued disturbances. But, sir,\" he cried, hammering his fist upon the table until the glasses rang, \"the party that is to save us was born at Pittsburgh last year on Washington's birthday. The Republican Party, sir.\"  \"Shucks!\" exclaimed Mr. Carvel, with amusement, \"The Black Republican Party, made up of old fools and young Anarchists, of Dutchmen and nigger-worshippers. Why, Whipple, that party's a joke. Where's your leader?\"  \"In Illinois,\" was the quick response.  \"What's his name?\"  \"Abraham Lincoln, sir,\" thundered Mr. Whipple. \"And to my way of thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than any of your Washington statesmen. 'This government,' said he to a friend of mine, 'cannot exist half slave and half free.'\"  So impressively did Mr. Whipple pronounce these words that Mr. Carvel stirred uneasily, and in spite of himself, as though he were listening to an oracle. He recovered instantly.  \"He's a demagogue, seeking for striking phrases, sir. You're too intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he.\"  \"I tell you he is not, sir.\"  \"I know him, sir,\" cried the Colonel, taking down his feet. \"He's an obscure lawyer. Poor white trash! Torn down poor! My friend Mr. Richardson of Springfield tells me he is low down. He was born in a log cabin, and spends most of his time in a drug-store telling stories that you would not listen to, Judge Whipple.\"  \"I would listen to anything he said,\" replied the Judge. \"Poor white trash, sir! The greatest men rise from the people. A demagogue!\" Mr. Whipple fairly shook with rage. \"The nation doesn't know him yet. But mark my words, the day will come when it will. He was ballotted for Vice-President in the Philadelphia convention last year. Nobody paid any attention to that. If the convention had heard him speak at Bloomington, he would have been nominated instead of Fremont. If the nation could have heard him, he would be President to-day instead of that miserable Buchanan. I happened to be at Bloomington. And while the idiots on the platform were drivelling, the people kept calling for Lincoln. I had never heard of him then. I've never forgot him since. He came ambling out of the back of the hall, a lanky, gawky looking man, ridiculously ugly, sir. But the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound. The language which your low-down lawyer used was that of a God-sent prophet, sir. He had those Illinois bumpkins all worked up,--the women crying, and some of the men, too. And mad! Good Lord, they were mad--'We will say to the Southern disunionists,' he cried,--'we will say to the Southern disunionists, we won't go out of the Union, and you shan't.'\"  There was a silence when the Judge finished. But presently Mr. Carvel took a match. And he stood over the Judge in his favorite attitude, --with his feet apart,--as he lighted another cigar.  \"I reckon we're going to have war, Silas,\" said he, slowly; \"but don't you think that your Mr. Lincoln scares me into that belief. I don't count his bluster worth a cent. No sirree! It's this youngster who comes out here from Boston and buys a nigger with all the money he's got in the world. And if he's an impetuous young fool; I'm no judge of men.\"  \"Appleton Brice wasn't precisely impetuous,\" remarked Mr. Whipple. And he smiled a little bitterly, as though the word had stirred a memory.  \"I like that young fellow,\" Mr. Carvel continued. \"It seems to be a kind of fatality with me to get along with Yankees. I reckon there's a screw loose somewhere, but Brice acted the man all the way through. He goa a fall out of you, Silas, in your room, after the show. Where are you going, Jinny?\"  Virginia had risen, and she was standing very erects with a flush on her face, waiting for her father to finish.  \"To see Anne Brinsmade,\" she said. \"Good-by, Uncle Silas.\"  She had called him so from childhood. Hers was the one voice that seemed to soften him--it never failed. He turned to her now with a movement that was almost"]]]
