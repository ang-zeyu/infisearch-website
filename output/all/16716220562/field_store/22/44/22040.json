When the invitation has been issued in the        name of the hostess only, a husband and wife        each send a card, and if in the name of hostess        and her daughter, each should send two        cards. If the invitation has been issued in        the name of the husband and wife, the wife        should send one and a husband two cards.         If the woman in the family is the only one        present at the function, she can leave cards        for the rest of the family.    MEN. Both the host and men wear the regulation        afternoon dress, consisting of the long        frock coat with single or double-breasted        waistcoat to match, or of some fancy cloth,        and gray trousers. White linen, a light tie,        a silk hat, gray gloves, and patent leather        shoes complete the costume.         The overcoat, hat, and cane are left in        the dressing-room, and the guest removes one        or both gloves as he pleases--remembering        that he must offer his ungloved right hand        to the hostess.    SHAKING HANDS. Guests on being presented to        the hostess should shake hands. If guest        takes leave of hostess, they should shake        hands. If the hostess is surrounded by        guests, a pleasant nod of farewell is admissible.    WOMEN. Women leave cards of their male relatives        as well as their own, even though their        names may be announced upon entering.        Guests leave their cards in a receptacle provided        for the purpose, or give them to the        servant at the door.         Women wear a costume appropriate for        the afternoon, and keep their hats and        gloves on.    AFTERNOON TEAS (INFORMAL). An afternoon tea is a        simple entertainment. Refreshments are        generally served to the guests. An innovation        lately introduced has become quite popular        --namely, young women, invited for        the purpose, wait upon the guests, bringing        in one dainty at a time.         An afternoon tea is called a formal afternoon        tea when engraved cards have been        issued, naming set date.    CARDS. Guests should leave cards in the hall, or        hand them to the servant. Women may        leave the cards of the men of her family.        Those unable to attend should send card the        same afternoon by mail or messenger.           See also AFTERNOON TEAS (Formal)-Cards.    DRESS. Both men and women wear afternoon dress.    GUESTS. All guests, both men and women, wear        afternoon dress.         Guests may suit their convenience in arriving        or departing--provided they do not        come at the opening hour, nor stay to the        last moment.         After the guests have left their wraps in        the dressing-rooms, they leave their cards in        the tray in the hall and enter the drawing-        room, the women preceding the men.         After greeting the hostess and being introduced        to those assisting her, the guests quietly move        away and mingle with the rest.         Each guest goes to the dining-room when        he pleases and leaves when he wishes. It is        not necessary upon departure to shake hands        with the hostess at a large reception, though        it is better to do so at a small affair.         It is not necessary for a guest to stay the        entire evening; twenty minutes is sufficient.    HOST. If present, he does not receive with his        wife. It is not essential that he be present        on such an occasion.    HOSTESS. The hostess wears full dress. Daughters        may assist, or young women may be asked to do so.    HOURS. From four to seven.    INVITATIONS. For an afternoon tea a visiting-        card may be used with the hour and date        written or engraved on it. They may be sent        by mail or messenger.         The invitation need not be acknowledged.    AFTERNOON WEDDING RECEPTIONS are conducted the        same as Wedding Receptions, which see.

AT HOMES.    AFTERNOON AT HOMES. The days for receiving        are engraved in the lower left hand        corner of the card, with hours specified if one        wishes.         No changes should be made in these hours        by the hostess unless for exceptional reasons,        and she should always be present at the        time set.         Unless very intimate, the call should be        made only on the specified days.    BACHELORS. It is not customary for a bachelor        to use \"At Home\" cards as a woman does,        nor to invite his friends by writing a date        and Music at four on his calling-cards in        place of an invitation.    DRESS. In the afternoon the caller should wear        afternoon dress, and in the evening evening        dress.    ACKNOWLEDGING INVITATIONS. Invitations to        an ordinary at home need no acknowledgment.    INVITATIONS. Cards for an \"At Home\" are engraved        with the hour for beginning the        entertainment--as, Chocolate at 4.30 o'clock.        The invitations to a formal \"At Home\"        should be sent in two envelopes, but to an        ordinary \"At Home\" in one envelope. For        informal affairs the hour may be written on        an ordinary \"At Home\" card.    BACHELORS' DINNERS. They follow the usual custom        of formal dinners, and may be as elaborate as        desired. Women may be invited. Such        dinners are often given for men only.    CALLS. Women do not call upon a bachelor        after attending a dinner given by him.    CHAPERONE. If women are present, a married        woman as chaperone is indispensable, and        her husband must also be invited. The host        should call upon the chaperone and personally        request the favor.         The chaperone is taken into dinner by the        host, unless the latter takes in the woman in        whose honor the dinner may be given. In        the latter case, the chaperone is seated at the        host's left. She gives the signal for the        women to leave the dining-room.         All guests should be introduced to the        chaperone, and she should be called upon        after a short time by the host.    DRESS. All guests wear evening dress.    HOST. The host should call upon the chaperone        within a few days after the dinner.         If men only are present, he either precedes        or follows the guests into the dining-room,        and if he has given the dinner in honor of        some man, he has the latter seated at his        right. His duties are the same as the host        at dinners.    INVITATIONS. These are usually given in brief        notes, but may be engraved, and are similar        to the regular invitations to dinners, and are        treated accordingly.    MEN. The men wear evening dress, and follow        the same etiquette as at other dinners.    WOMEN. The women wear evening dress, and        follow the same etiquette as at all dinners,        except that no calls are made by them afterward        upon the host.    BACHELOR'S FAREWELL DINNER. If the groom wishes,     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#2)"],["body","   he may give a farewell dinner a few evenings        before the wedding to his best man, ushers,        and a few intimate friends. He sits at the        head of the table and the best man opposite,        and on this occasion he may give scarf-pins,        link cuff-buttons--or neckties and gloves, if        he wishes--to the best man and ushers.    BACHELORS' LUNCHEONS. These are conducted like        BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see. The one difference        is that, should the luncheon be given        before 6 P.M., afternoon dress should be worn.    BACHELORS' OPERA PARTIES. See THEATRE AND OPERA        PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.    BACHELORS' SUPPERS. These are conducted the same        as BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see.    BACHELORS' TEAS OR AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS.    CHAPERONES. If women are present, a married        chaperone is indispensable, who should be        the first person invited by personal call.         The chaperone at a small affair pours the        tea, and at a large one she receives with the        host, and each guest is presented to her.         The host conducts the chaperone to her        carriage, and also any other women who may        have assisted her.    DRESS. The hosts and guests wear afternoon        dress.    INVITATIONS. These maybe oral, brief notes, or,        for a large affair, engraved, and should be        sent from three days to a week in advance.    HOST. The host should greet his guests at the        door, shaking hands with each one, and introducing        to the chaperone those not known        to her.         He introduces guests who are strangers to        each other, bids them adieu, accompanies the        women to the door, and escorts the chaperone        to her carriage, and if she has come        alone without one, may very properly escort        her home.         If at a large reception several women have        helped him entertain, he should thank them        and see them to their carriages.         He will, of course, see that there is provided        a dressing-room for women with a maid to        wait upon them, and that the rooms are in        good order, well furnished with flowers, and        that the refreshments are attended to.          See also INVITATIONS.    MEN. Afternoon dress is worn.    WOMEN. The invitations, engraved or oral,        should be promptly acknowledged.         Women wear dress customary at afternoon        teas, and on their entrance should greet the        host. Upon departing they take leave of him,        though this is not necessary if the reception        be a large one.         If a young woman knows that a chaperone        is present, she need not have her own chaperone        accompany her.         If the chaperone leaves early, she should do        likewise.    BACHELORS' THEATRE PARTY. See THEATRE AND OPERA        PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.    BADGES--BALLS (PUBLIC). It is customary for men        and women on the committees to wear on the        left side of the breast ornamental badges,        embroidered with the official position of the        wearer.    BAGGAGE. If a man is traveling with a woman, he        should see to the checking and care of her        baggage.          See also TRAVELING.    WEDDING TRIP. The best man should, some        time before the wedding, see that the baggage        of the bridal couple has been checked, and        the checks given to the groom.          See also BEST MAN.    BALLS. A ball is an evening function, beginning at        a late hour, devoted wholly to dancing. The        costumes are more elaborate, the supper arrangements        more extensive, and the floral        decorations more lavish than at a dance.    ACCEPTING INVITATION TO DANCE. While a        young woman may accept or decline any invitation        to dance, it is considered an act of discourtesy        to refuse one man for a dance and        to accept an invitation thereafter for the        same dance from another.    ANNOUNCING GUESTS. The hostess decides        whether or not the guests are to be announced.        At public balls it is customary.    ANSWERING INVITATIONS. These should be answered        immediately, and if declined, the        ticket should be returned.    ARRIVING AT. There is no set rule when guests        should arrive.         In the city, guests should arrive anywhere        between eleven and twelve, and in the country,        fifteen minutes after the hour set in the        invitation.    ASKING WOMEN TO DANCE. A man asks for        the privilege of a dance either with the        daughter of the hostess, with any guest of        the latter, or with any young woman receiving        with her.         On being introduced to a woman, he may        ask her for a dance, and should be punctual        in keeping the engagement.         It is her privilege to end the dance at any        moment she wishes, after which he should        conduct her to her chaperone or find a seat        for her, after which he is at liberty to go        elsewhere.         If for any cause a man has to break his        engagements to dance, he should personally        explain the matter to every woman with        whom he has an engagement and make a        suitable apology.    BALLS, ASSEMBLY. The etiquette at an assembly        ball is much the same as at a private ball,        the functions and duties of the hostess being        filled by a committee of women selected for        that purpose.         On entering the room, the guests bow to        the committee and pass on.         It is not necessary to take leave of the        committee.    CARRIAGE. A man should provide a carriage        in which to call for the woman he escorts        and her chaperone.    CHAPERONES. For a small ball given in a private        house, the hostess need not invite the mothers        of the young women, and the young women        can properly attend, knowing that the hostess        will act as a chaperone.         But at a large ball it is necessary to invite        the mother as well as the daughters, and        the chaperone as well as the debutante under        her care. The mother can send regrets for        herself, and send her daughters in care of a        maid. Or she can attend, and, after remaining        a suitable time, she may entrust her        daughter to the care of a chaperone who        intends to remain the whole evening.    BALLS FOR DEBUTANTE.    DRESS. A debutante should dress in white or        some extremely delicate color, and wear very        little jewelry--some simple brooch or single        piece of jewelry, or a slender chain of pearls.    DUTIES OF DAUGHTERS. Except at her own        debut, a daughter does not assist her mother        in receiving. She should be ready, however,        to see that young women have partners, and        to speak, without introduction, to strangers.    GUEST OF HONOR. If the ball is given in honor        of some special person, he should be met on        his arrival, introduced to the women of the        reception committee, escorted to the seat prepared        for him, and be looked after the entire        evening.         At the end of the ball he should be escorted        to his carriage.    DUTIES OF HOST. It is not necessary that a        man receive with his wife. He should do all        he can to help make the ball successful,        especially if his name appears on the invitation.        He should assist in finding partners        for the women, taking the chaperones into        supper, preventing the men from selfishly        remaining in the dressing-room, and at the        end escorting unattended women to their        carriages.         When a formal supper is served, he takes        into supper the leading chaperone.    DUTIES OF HOSTESS. As a ball is an entertainment        for dancing, it is better to give two        small balls where the guests are not crowded        than one where they are. It is permissible        for a hostess not having sufficient room to        hire rooms in some place suitable for the        purpose.         In selecting guests, it is wise to have more        men present than women.         The hostess should see to it that the rooms        are well ventilated and well lighted. An        awning and a carpet from the street to the        hall door should be provided.         The hostess should stand near the door,        prepared to receive the guests as they enter,        shaking hands with each one, friend or        stranger, and introducing any woman who        may receive with her.         A hostess herself should not dance until        late in the evening, unless she knows that        nearly all her guests have arrived.         A wise hostess will personally see that the        women are provided with partners, and that        diffident young men are introduced.         The hostess should see that the floor is        suitable for dancing, that music is arranged,        programs printed, that dressing-rooms, one        for the men and one for the women, are arranged        for with suitable attendants.         The hostess should stand where the guests        can take leave of her, and should shake        hands with each when leaving.    HOURS. In the city the hour for a ball to begin        is from 10.30 to 11 P.M., but in the country        the hour is earlier--from 9 to 9.30.         A public ball begins promptly at the time        mentioned in the announcement.    INVITATIONS. These are issued from ten to        twenty days before the ball, and should be        answered immediately.         For an impromptu dance, they may be        issued within a few days of the affair.         These invitations should be engraved. As        a general rule, it is not now customary to put        on them the letters R. S. V. P.         But when an engraved invitation is posted,        two envelopes are used, the inner one bearing        the"]]]
