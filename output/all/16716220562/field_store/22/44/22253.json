When you bend your arm, then, this is what takes place. =By the exercise of your will a something is started in your brain. That something--we will not stop now to ask what that something is--passes from your brain to the spinal cord, leaves the spinal cord and travels along certain nerves, picking its way among the intricate bundles of delicate nervous threads which run from the upper part of the spinal cord to the arm until it reaches the biceps muscle. The muscle, directly that “something” comes to it along its nerves, contracts, shortens, and grows thick; it rises up in the arm; its lower tendon pulls at the radius; the radius with the ulna moves on the fulcrum of the humerus at the elbow-joint, and the arm is bent.=  You wish to leave off bending the arm. Your will ceases to act. The something to which your will had given rise dies away in the brain, dies away in the spinal cord, dies away in the nerves, even in the finest twigs. The muscle, no longer excited by that something, ceases to contract, ceases to swell up, ceases to pull at the radius, and the fore-arm by its own weight falls into its former straightness, stretching, as it falls, the muscle to its natural length.  =18.= So far I hope you have followed me, but we are still very far from being at the bottom of the matter. Why does the muscle contract when that something reaches it through the nerves? We must content ourselves by saying that it is the property of the muscle to do so. Does the muscle always possess this property? No, not always.  Suppose you were to tie a cord very tightly round the top of your arm, close to the shoulder. What would happen? If you tied it tight enough (I don’t ask you to do it, for you might hurt yourself) the arm would become pale, and very soon would begin to grow cold. It would get numbed, and would gradually seem to grow very heavy and clumsy; your feeling in it would be blunted, and after a while be altogether lost. When you tried to bend your arm you would find great difficulty in doing so. Though you tried ever so much, you could not easily make the biceps contract, and at last you would not be able to do so at all. You would discover that you had lost all power of bending your arm. And then if you undid the cord you would find that after some very uncomfortable sensations, little by little the power would come back to you; the arm would grow warm again, the heaviness and clumsiness would pass away, the feeling in it would return, you would be able to bend it, and at last all would be as it was before.  What did you do when you tied the cord tight? The chief thing you did was to press on the blood-vessels in the arm and so stop the blood from moving in them. If instead of tying the cord round the whole arm you had tied a finer thread round the blood-vessels only, you would have brought about very nearly the same effect. We saw in the last lesson how all parts of the body are supplied with blood-vessels, with veins, and arteries. In the arm there is a very large artery, branches from which go all over the arm. Some of these branches go to the biceps muscle. What would happen if you tied these branches only, tying them so tight as to stop all the blood in them, but not interfering with the blood-vessels in the rest of your arm? The arm as a whole would grow neither pale nor cold, it would not become clumsy or heavy, you would not lose your feeling in it, but nevertheless if you tried to bend your arm you would find you could not do it. You could not make the biceps contract, though all the rest of the arm might seem to be quite right.  What does this teach us? =It teaches us that the power which a muscle has of contracting when called upon to do so, may be lost and regained, and that it is lost when the blood is prevented from getting to it.= When a cord is tied round the whole arm, the power of the whole arm is lost. This loss of power is the beginning of death, and indeed if the cord were not unloosed the arm would quite die--would mortify, as it is said. When only those blood-vessels which go to the biceps are tied, the biceps alone begins to die, all the rest of the arm remaining alive, and the first sign of death in the biceps is the loss of the power to contract when called upon to do so.  In order that you may bend your arm, then, you must not only have a biceps muscle with its nerves, its tendons, and all its arrangements of bones and joints, but the muscle must be supplied with blood.  =19.= We can now go a step further and ask the question, =What is there in the blood that thus gives to the muscle the power of contracting, that in other words keeps the muscle alive?= The answer is very easily found. What is the name commonly given to this power of a muscle to contract? We generally call it strength. Lay your arm straight out on the table, put a heavy weight in your hand, and try to bend your arm. If you could do it, one would say you were strong; if you could not, one would say you were weak--all the stronger or weaker, the heavier or lighter the weight. In the one case your biceps had great power of contracting; in the other, little power. Try and find out the heaviest weight you can raise in this way by bending your arm, some morning, not too long after breakfast, when you are fresh and in good condition. Go without any dinner, and in the afternoon or evening, when you are tired and hungry, try to raise the same weight in the same way. You will not be able to do it. Your biceps will have lost some of its power of contracting, will be weaker than it was in the morning. What makes it weak? The want of food. But how can the food affect the muscle? You do not place the food in the muscle; you put it into your mouth, and from thence it goes into your stomach and into the rest of your alimentary canal, and there seems to disappear. How does the food get at the muscle? By means of the blood. The food becomes blood. =The things which you eat as food become changed into other things which form part of the blood. Those things going to the muscle give it strength and enable it to contract.= And that is why food makes you strong.  =20.= But you are always wanting food day by day, from time to time. Why is that? Because the muscle in getting strength out of the food changes it, uses it up, and so is always wanting fresh blood and new food. We have seen in Art. 1 that food is fuel. We have also seen that muscle (and other parts of the body do the same) is always burning, burning without flame but with heat, burning slowly but burning all the same, and doing the more work the more it burns. The fuel it burns is not dry wood or coal, but wet, watery blood, a special kind of fuel prepared for its private use, in the workshop of the stomach or elsewhere, out of the food eaten by the mouth. This it is always using up; of this it must always have a proper supply, if it is to go on working. Hence there must always be fresh blood preparing; hence there must from time to time be fresh supplies of food out of which to manufacture fresh blood.  To understand then fully what happens when you bend your arm, we have to learn not only what we have learnt about the bones and the joint and the muscle and the nerves, about the machinery and the engine, we have to study also how the food is changed into blood, how the blood is brought to the muscle, what it is in the blood on which the muscle lives, what it is which the muscle burns, and how the things which result from the burning, the ashes and the smoke or carbonic acid and the rest of them, are carried away from the muscle and out of the body.  Meanwhile let me remind you that for the sake of being simple I have been all this while speaking of one muscle only, the biceps in the arm. But there are a multitude of muscles in the body besides the biceps, as there are many bones besides those of the arm, and many joints besides the elbow. But what I have said of the one is in a general way true of all the rest. The muscles have various forms, they pull upon the bones in various ways, they work on levers of various kinds. The joints differ much in the way in which they work. All manner of movements are produced by muscles pulling sometimes with and sometimes against each other. But you will find when you come to examine them that all the movements of which your body is capable depend at bottom on this--=that certain muscular fibres, in obedience to a something reaching them through their nerves, contract, shorten, and grow thick, and so pull their one end towards the other, and that to do this they must be continually supplied with pure blood=.  Moreover, what I have said of the relations of muscle to blood is also true of all other parts of the body. Just as the muscle cannot work without a due supply of blood, so also the brain and the spinal cord and the nerves have even a more pressing need of pure blood. The weakness and faintness which we feel from want of food is quite as much a weakness of the brain and of the nerves as of the muscles,--perhaps rather more so. And other parts of the body of which we shall have to speak later on need blood too.  The whole history of our daily life is shortly this. The food we eat becomes blood, the blood is carried all over the body, round and round in the torrent of the circulation; as it sweeps past them, or rather through them, the muscle, the brain, the nerve, the skin pick out new food for their work and give back the things they have used or no longer want. As they all have different works, some use up what others have thrown away. There are, besides, scavengers and cleaners to pick up things no longer wanted anywhere and to throw them out of the body. Thus the blood is kept pure as well as fresh. Through the blood thus ever brought to them, each part does its work: the muscle contracts, the brain feels and wills, the nerves carry the feeling and the willing, and the other organs of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53347"],["title","Physiology (#7)"],["body"," body do their work too, and thus the whole body is kept alive and well.     THE NATURE OF BLOOD. § IV.   =21. What, then, is this blood which does so much?=  Did you ever look through a good microscope at the thin transparent web of a frog’s foot, and watch the red blood coursing along its narrow channels? If not, go and look at it at once; you will never understand any physiology till you have done so. There you will see a network of delicate passages far finer than any of your own hairs, and through those passages a tumbling crowd of tiny oval yellow globules hurrying and jostling along. Some of the passages are wider than others, and through some of the wider ones you will see a thick stream of globules rushing onwards towards the smaller channels, and spreading out among them. The globules which you see are floating in a fluid so clear that you cannot see it. Some of the smaller channels are so narrow that only one globule or =corpuscle=, as we may call it, can pass through at a time, and very frequently you may see them passing in single file. Watching them as they glide along these narrow paths, you will note that at last they tumble again into wider passages, somewhat like those from which they came, except that the stream runs away from instead of towards the narrower channels; and in the stream the corpuscle you are watching shoots out of sight. The finest passages are called =capillaries=; they are guarded by delicate walls which you can hardly see; they seem to you passages only, and how fine and small they are will come home to you when you recollect that all you are looking at is going on in the depths of a skin which is so thin that perhaps you would be inclined to say it has no thickness at all.  The larger channels which are bringing the blood down to the capillaries are the ends of vessels like those which in the rabbit you learnt to call arteries, and the other larger channels through which the blood is rushing away from the capillaries are the beginnings of veins.  When you have watched this frog’s foot for some little time, turn away and reflect that in almost every part of your own body, in every square inch, in almost every square line, something very similar might be seen could the microscope be brought to bear upon it, only the corpuscles are smaller and round, the capillaries narrower and for the most part more thick-set, and the race a swifter one. In the muscle of which we were speaking in the last lesson, each of the soft long fibres of which the muscle is composed is wrapped round with a close network of these tiny capillaries, through which, as long as life lasts, for ever rushes a swift stream of blood, reddened by countless numbers of tiny corpuscles.  In every part of your flesh, in your brain and spinal cord, in your skin, your bones, your lungs, in all organs and in nearly every part of your body, there is the same hurrying rush through narrow tubes of red corpuscles and of the clear fluid in which these swim.  If you prick your finger it bleeds. Almost any part of your body would bleed were you to prick it. So thick-set are the little blood-vessels, that wherever you thrust a needle, be it as fine a needle as you please, you will be sure to pierce and tear some little blood channel, either artery or capillary or vein, and out will come the ruddy drop.  =22. What is blood?= It is a fluid; it runs about like water: yet it is thicker than water, thicker for two reasons. In the first place, water, that is pure water, is all one substance. If you were to look at it with ever so powerful a microscope, you would see nothing in it. It is exceedingly transparent--you can see very well through ever such a thickness of clean water. But if you were to try and look through even a very thin sheet of blood spread out between two glass plates, you would find that you could see very little; =blood is very opaque=. If again you examine a drop of your blood with a microscope, what do you see? =A number of little=  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--_Red and White Corpuscles of the Blood magnified._       _A._ Moderately magnified. The red corpuscles are seen lying in      rows like rolls of coins; at _a_ and _a_ are seen two white      corpuscles.       _B._ Red corpuscles much more highly magnified, seen in face; _C._      ditto, seen in profile; _D._ ditto, in rows, rather more highly      magnified; _E._ a red corpuscle swollen into a sphere by imbibition      of water.       _F._ A white corpuscle magnified same as _B._; _G._ ditto, throwing      out some blunt processes; _K._ ditto, treated with acetic acid, and      showing nucleus, magnified same as _D._       _H._ Red corpuscles puckered or crenate all over.       _I._ Ditto, at the edge only. ]  =round bodies, the blood discs or blood corpuscles= (Fig. 4, _A_). If you look carefully you will notice that most of them are round, as _B_; but every now and then you see something like _C_. That is one of the round ones seen sideways; for they are not round or spherical like a ball, but circular and dimpled in the middle, something like certain kinds of biscuit. When you see one by itself it looks a little yellow in colour, that is all; but when you see them in a lump, the lump is clearly red. Remember how small they are: three thousand of them put flat in a line, edge to edge, like a row of draughts, would just about stretch across one inch. All the redness there is in blood belongs to them. When you see one of them, you see so little of the redness that it seems yellow. If you were to put a drop of blood into a tumbler of water, the water would not be stained red, but only just turned of a yellowish tint, so little redness would be given to it by the drop of blood. In the same way a very very thin slice of currant jelly would look yellowish, not red.  These red corpuscles are not hard solid things, but delicate and soft, very tender, very easily broken to pieces, more like the tiniest lumps of red jelly than anything else, and yet made so as to bear all the squeezing which they get as they are driven round and round the body.  Besides these red corpuscles, you may see if you look attentively =other little bodies, just a little bigger than the red corpuscles, not coloured at all, and not circular and flat, but quite round like a ball= (Fig. 4, _a_, _F_, _G_). That is to say, these are very often quite round, only they have a curious trick of changing their form. Imagine you were looking at a suet dumpling so small that about two thousand five hundred of them could be placed side by side in the length of one inch--and suppose the round dumpling while you were looking at it gradually changed into the shape of a three-cornered tart, and then into a rounded square, and then into the shape of a pear, and then into a thing that had no shape at all, and then back again into a round ball, and kept doing this apparently all of its own accord while you were looking at it--wouldn’t you think it very curious? Well, one of these little bodies in the blood of which we are speaking, and which are called white corpuscles, may be seen, when a drop of blood is watched under the microscope, to go on in this way, continually changing its shape. But of these =white corpuscles= of the blood, and of their wonderful movements, you will learn more as you go on in your physiological studies.  =23.= Besides these red and white corpuscles there is nothing else very important in the blood that you can _see_ with the microscope; but their being in the blood is one reason why blood is thicker than water.  Did you ever see a pig or sheep killed? If so, you would be sure to notice that the blood ran quite fluid from the blood-vessels in the neck, ran and was spilt like so much water--but that very soon the blood caught in the pail or spilt on the stones became quite solid, so that you could pick it up in lumps. Whenever blood is shed from the living body, within a short time it becomes solid. This becoming solid is called the =clotting= or =coagulation of blood=.  What makes it clot? Suppose while the blood was running from the pig’s neck into the butcher’s pail, and while it was still quite fluid, you were to take a bunch of twigs and keep slowly stirring the blood round and round in the pail. You would naturally expect that the blood would soon begin to clot, would get thicker and thicker and more and more difficult to stir. But it does not; and if you keep on stirring long enough you will find that it never clots at all. =By continually stirring it you will prevent its clotting.= Now take out your bundle of twigs: you will find it covered all over with a thick reddish mass of some soft sticky substance; and if you pump on the red mass you will be able to wash away all its red colour, and will have nothing left but a quantity of white, soft, sticky, stringy material, all entangled and matted together among the twigs of your bundle. This stringy material is in reality made up of a number of fine, delicate, soft, elastic threads or fibres, and is called =fibrin=.  =You see, by stirring, or, as it is frequently called, whipping the blood with the bundle of twigs, you have taken the fibrin out of the blood, and so prevented its clotting.=  If you were to take one of the clotted lumps of blood that were spilt on the ground or a bit of the clot from a pail in which the blood had not been whipped, and wash it long enough, you would find at last that all the colour went away from the lump, and you had nothing left but a small quantity of white stringy substance. This white stringy substance is fibrin--exactly the same thing you got on your bundle of twigs.  If the blood is carefully caught in a pail, and afterwards not disturbed at all, it clots into a solid mass. The whole of the blood seems to have changed into a complete jelly; and if you turn it out of the pail, as you may do, it keeps its shape, and gives you quite a mould of the pail, a great trembling red jelly just the shape of "]]]
