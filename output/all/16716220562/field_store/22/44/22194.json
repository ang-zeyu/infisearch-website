If this fool could only use his bayonet as he can shoot, I think I would be dead too. His brains, though, are all behind his right eye. Tie him up, where no little child can come and make him prisoner!”  “Arrest that man!” commanded Brown, and two men detached themselves from the end of the guard, and stood him between them, behind the line.  “Here's his rifle!” smiled Juggut Khan, and Brown received it with an ill grace.  “How did you get past the other sentry?” he asked.  “Oh, easily! You English are only brave; you have no brains. Sometimes one part of the rule is broken, but the other never. You are not always brave!”  “I suppose you're angry because he killed your horse?”  “I am angry, Brown sahib, for greater happenings than that! The man conceivably was right, since I did not halt for him, and I suppose he had his orders. I am angry because the standard of rebellion is raised, and because of what it means to me!”  “Are you drunk, Juggut Khan?”  “Your honor is pleased to be humorous? No, I am not drunk. Nor have I eaten opium. I have eaten of the bread of bitterness this day, and drunk of the cup of gall. I have seen British officers--good, brave fools, some of whom I knew and loved--killed by the men they were supposed to lead. I have seen a barracks burning, and a city given over to be looted. I have seen white women--nay, sahib, steady!--I have seen them run before a howling mob, and I have seen certain of them shot by their own husbands!”  “Quietly!” ordered Brown. “Don't let the men hear!”  “One of them I slew myself, because her husband, who was wounded, sent me to her and bade me kill her. She died bravely. And certain others I have hidden where the mutineers are not likely to discover them at present. I ride now for succor--or, I rode, rather, until your expert marksman interfered with me! I now need another horse.”  “You mean that the native troops have mutinied?” “I mean rather more than that, sahib. Mohammedans and Hindus are as one, and the crowd is with them. This is probably the end of the powder-train, for, from what I heard shouted by the mutineers, almost the whole of India is in revolt already!”  “Why?”  “God knows, sahib! The reason given is that the cartridges supplied are greased with the blended fat of pigs and cows, thus defiling both Hindu and Mohammedan alike. But, if you ask me, the cause lies deeper. In the meantime, the rebels have looted Jailpore and burned their barracks, and within an hour or two they will start along this road for Bholat, which they have a mind to loot likewise. My advice to you is retire at once. Get me another horse from somewhere, that I may carry warning. Then follow me as fast as you and your men can move.”  “Bah!” said Brown. “They'll find General Baines to deal with them at Bholat.”  “Who knows yet how many in Bholat have not risen? Are you positive that the garrison there has not already been surrounded by rebels? I am not! I would not be at all surprised to learn that General Baines is so busy defending himself that he can not move in any direction. And--does your honor mean to hold this guardroom here against five thousand?”  “I mean to obey my orders!” answered Brown.  “And your orders are?”  “My orders!”  “Would they preclude the provision of another horse for me?”  “There's a village about a mile away, down over yonder, where I think you'll find a decent horse--along that road there.”  “And your honor's orders would possibly permit a certain payment for the horse?”  “Positively not!” said Brown.  “Then--'  “To seize a horse, for military use, under the spur of necessity, and after giving a receipt for it, would be in order.”  “So I am to spend the night wandering around the countryside, in a vain endeavor to--”  But Brown was doing mathematics in his head. Two men to guard prisoners, two on guard at the crossroads, two at the guardroom door--six from twelve left six, and six were not enough to rape a countryside.  “Guard!” he ordered. “Release that prisoner. Now, you Stanley, let this be a lesson to you, and remember that I only set you free because I'd have been short-handed otherwise. Number One! Stand guard between the clink and the guardroom door. Keep an eye on both. The remainder--form two-deep. Right turn! By the left, quick-march! Left wheel!... Now,”  he said, turning to Juggut Khan, “if you'll come along I'll soon get a horse for you!”  The Rajput strode along beside him, and gave him some additional information as they went, Brown taking very good care all the time to keep out of earshot of the men and to speak to Juggut Khan in low tones. He learned, among other things, that Juggut Khan had lost every anna that he owned, and had only escaped with his life by dint of luck and swordship and most terrific riding.  “Are all of you Rajputs loyal?” asked Brown.  “I know not. I know that I myself shall stay loyal until the end!”  “Well--the end is not in doubt. There can only be one end!” commented Brown.  “Of a truth, sahib, I believe that you are right. There can only be one end. This night is not more black, this horizon is no shorter, than the outlook!”  “Then, you mean--”  “I mean, sahib, that this uprising is more serious than you--or any other Englishman--is likely to believe. I believe that the side I fight for will be the losing side.”  “And yet, you stay loyal?”  “Why not?”  “All the same, Juggut Khan--I'm not emotional, or a man of many words. I don't trust Indians as a rule! I--but--here--will you shake hands?”  “Certainly, sahib!” said the Rajput. “We be two men, you and I! Why should the one be loyal and the other not?”  “When this is over,” said Brown, “if it ends the way we want, and we're both alive, I'd like to call myself your friend!”  “I have always been your friend, sahib, and you mine, since the day when you bandaged up a boy and gave him your own drinking-water and carried him in to Bholat on your shoulder, twenty miles or more.”  “Oh, as for that--any other man would have done the same thing. That was nothing!”  “Strange that when a white man does an honorable deed he lies about it!”  said Juggut Khan. “That was not nothing, sahib, and you know it was not nothing! You know that from the heat and the exertion you were ill for more than a month afterward. And you know that there were others there, of my own people, who might have done what you did, and did not!”  “But, hang it all! Why drag up a little thing like this?”  “Because, sahib, I might have no other opportunity, and--”  “Well? And what?”  “And the Rajput boy whom you carried was my son!”     III.  The finding of a remount for Juggut Khan was not so troublesome as might have been supposed. The rumors and plans and whispered orders for the coming struggle had been passed around the countryside for months past, and every man who owned a horse had it stalled safely near him, for use when the hour should come.  There were country-ponies and Arabs and Kathiawaris and Khaubulis among which to pick, and though the average run of them was worse than merely bad, and though both best and worst were hidden away whenever possible, good horses were discoverable. Within an hour, Bill Brown; with the aid of his men, had routed out a Khaubuji stallion for Juggut Khan, one fit to carry him against time the whole of the way to Bholat.  The Rajput mounted him where Brown unearthed him, and watched the signing of a scribbled-out receipt with a cynical smile.  “If he comes to claim his money for the horse,” said Juggut Khan, “I--even I, who am penniless--will pay him. Good-by, Brown sahib!” He leaned over and grasped the sergeant by the hand. “Take my advice, now. I know what is happening and what has happened. Fall back on Bholat at once. Hurry! Seize horses or even asses for your men, and ride in hotfoot. Salaam!”  He drove his right spur in, wheeled the horse and started across country in the direction of Bholat at a hand-gallop, guiding himself solely by the soldier's sixth sense of direction, and leaving the problem of possible pitfalls to the horse.  “If what he says is true,” said Brown, as the clattering hoof-beats died away, “and I'm game to take my oath he wouldn't lie to me, I'd give more than a little to have him with me for the next few hours!”  The men came clustering round him now, anxious for an explanation. They had held their tongues while Juggut Khan was there, because they happened to know Brown too well to do otherwise. He would have snubbed any man who dared to question him before the Indian. But, now that the Indian was gone, curiosity could stay no longer within bounds.  “What is it, Sergeant? Anything been happening? What's the news? What's that I heard him say about rebellion? They're a rum lot, them Rajputs. D'you think he's square? Tell us, Sergeant!”  “Listen, then. Rebellion has broken out. The native barracks at Jailpore have been burned, and all the English officers are killed--or so says Juggut Khan. He's riding on, to carry the news to General Baines. He says that the mutineers are planning to come along this way some time within the next few hours!”  “What are we going to do, then?”  “That's my business! I'm in command here!”  “Yes, but, Sergeant--aren't you going back to Bholat? Aren't you going to follow him? Are you going to stay here and get cut up? We'll get caught here like rats in a trap!”  “Are you giving orders here?” asked Brown acidly. “Fall in! Come on, now! Hurry! 'Tshun--eyes right--ri'--dress. Eyes--front. Ri'--turn. By the left--quick--march! Silence, now! Left! Left! Left!”  He marched them back toward the crossroads without giving them any further opportunity to remonstrate or ask for information.  It was not until he reached the crossroads, without being challenged, that he showed any sign of being in any way disturbed.  “Sentry!” he shouted. “Sentry!”  But there was no answer.  “Halt!” he ordered, and he himself went forward to investigate. The "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5315"],["title","Told in the East (#4)"],["body","swallowed him, but the men could hear him move, and they heard him fall. They heard him muttering, too, within ten paces of them. Then they heard his order.  “Bring a light here, some one.”  One man produced a piece of candle, struck a match and lit it. A moment later they had all broken order, and were standing huddled up together like a frightened flock of sheep, peering through dancing, candle-lit shadows at something horrible that Brown was handling.  “What is it, Sergeant?”  “What in hell's happened?”  “Who was that swearing?” inquired Brown, with a sudden look up across his shoulder. “You, Taylor? You again? Swearing in the presence of death? Talking of hell, with your two comrades lying dead at the crossroads, and you like to follow both o' them at any minute?”  Both of the guards lay dead. They lay quite neatly, side by side, without a sign about them to show that they had met with violence. Brown rolled one body over, though, and then the cause of death became more obvious. A stream of blood welled out of the man's back, from between the shoulder-blades--warm blood, that had not even started to coagulate.  “They've been dead about three minutes!” commented Brown, rising, and wiping his hands in the road-dust to get the blood off them. “Pick 'em up. Carefully, now! Frog-march 'em, face-downwards. That's better! Now, forward. Quick, march!”  The procession advanced toward the guardhouse in grim silence, and once again there was no challenge when there should have been. The lamp was still burning in the guardroom, for they could see it plainly as they drew nearer, but there was no noise of a sentry's footfalls, or hoarse “Halt!” and “Who comes there?”  Nor was there any sign yet of the man whom Brown had left to guard both “clink” and guardroom. Brown let them take their dead comrades into the guardroom first, then set two fresh guards at the door, and covered up the bodies with a sheet before commencing to investigate.  He started off toward the cell where he had imprisoned the fakir. He went by himself, and no one volunteered to go with him.  He had gone five yards when the second explanation met his eyes. This time there was no need to stoop down, nor to turn any body over. The sentry whom he had left to guard both cell and guardroom stood bolt upright, with his mouth and his eyes wide open; skewered to the wall of the guardhouse by an iron spike, which pierced his chest.  “A lamp and four men here!” ordered Brown, without waiting to let the horror of the sight sink in. “Take that poor chap down, and lay him in the guardroom beside the others. How? How should I know? Pull it out, or break it off--I don't care which; don't leave him there, that's all.”  He walked on toward the cell-door, while they labored, and fingered gingerly around the spike, which must have been driven through the sentry's chest with a hammer.  “I thought as much!” he muttered. And, though he had not thought as much, he might have done so. “I knew that a man who could maim his own body in that way was capable of any crime in the calendar!”  The door of the cell stood open, and there was no sign of any fakir, or of any one who might have helped him go--nothing but an empty cell, with the haunting smell of the fakir still abiding in it.  Bill Brown spat, and closed the cell-door.  “I'm thinking that Juggut Khan told nothing but the truth,” he muttered. “Things look right, don't they, if that's so! Obey, Obey! I'd have liked to see England just once again--I would indeed. If I could only see her just once. If I'd a letter from her, or her picture. This is a rotten, rat-in-a-hole, lonely, uncreditable way to die! I wish Juggut Khan were here. I'd have somebody to help me keep my good courage up in that case.”  The lock on the cell-door was broken, so he only closed it, then started back toward the guardroom.  “Three rifles, and three ammunition pouches gone!” he muttered. “That's three weapons they've got, in any case. A hornet's nest'd be better stopping in than this place.”  He overtook the men who were carrying in the nail-killed sentry, and he saw that their faces were drawn and white. So were those of the other men, who were clustered in the guardroom door.  “What next, Sergeant? Hadn't we better be quick? Why not burn the place? That'd do instead o' buryin' the dead ones, and it'd give us a light to get away by. Might serve as a beacon, too. Might fetch assistance!”  It was evident that panic had set in.  “Fall in!” commanded Brown, and his straight back took on a curve that meant straightness to the nth power.  “'Tshun! Ri'--dress! Eyes--front!”  He glared at them for just about one minute before he spoke, and during that minute each man there realized that what was coming would be quite irrevocable.  “I'm sergeant here. My orders are to hold this post until relieved. Therefore--and I hope there's no man here holds any other notion; I hope it for his own sake!--until we are relieved, we're going to hold it! Moreover, this command is going to be a real command, from now on. It's going to buck up. I'm going to put some ginger in it. There are three dead men here to be avenged, and I'm going to avenge 'em, or make you do it! And if any man imagines he's going to help himself by feeling afraid, let me assure him that the only thing he needs to fear is me! I've a right to command men--I know how--I intend to do it. And if I've got to make men first out of whey-faced cowards, why, I'm game to do it, and this is just where I begin! Now! Anybody got a word to say?”  There was grim silence.  “Good! I'll assume, then, until I'm contradicted, that you're all brave men. Into the guardroom with you!”  “Sahib! Sahib!” said a voice beside him.  “Well? What?”  It was the Beluchi interpreter who had carried the lamp for him that evening when he arrested the fakir.  “Run, sahib! It is time to run away!”  “Go on, then! Why don't you run?”  “I am afraid, sahib.”  “Of what?”  “Of the men who slew the soldiers. Sahib! Remember what the fakir said. You will be pegged out on an anthill, sahib, when you have been beaten. Run, while there is yet time!”  “Did you see them kill my men?”  “Nay, sahib!”  “How was that?”  “I ran away and hid, sahib.”  “How many were there?”  “Very many. The Punjabi skin-buyer brought them.”  “He did, did he? Very well! Did he go off with the fakir?”  “I think he did. I did not see.”  “Well, we'll suppose he did, then. And when the day breaks; we'll suppose that we can find him, and we'll go in search of him, and I wouldn't like to be that Punjabi when I do find him! Get into the guard-room, and wait in there until I give you leave to stir.”     IV.  An Indian city that has yet to have its mysterie's laid bare and banished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The bazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow but straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys, deep sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls and guarded stairways.  For every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where a man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no designer, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of secret ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the newest house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against the kings of men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.  After the Mutiny of '57 came broader roads--so that a cannon might be trained along them.  But in '57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat and rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and prophecies were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din of many-colored markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a Hindu king to commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem Nizam, to celebrate his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again by the Honorable East India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its native troops.  From the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy back-bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the sin-steeped underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the many-graded, many-minded polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a million underdogs had turned against their masters. A hundred factions and as many more religions, all had one common end in view--to loot. All were agreed on one thing--that the first stage of the game must be to turn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India, into a charnel-house.  Around and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept uncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys, with the blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British uniforms, and the unspent pay of “John Company” still jingling in their pockets, danced weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing their way, when they saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women screamed. Caste looted caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the streets. Here and there a pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had wealth had also courage, and apprentices and friends to help him defend his store.  And through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and the volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of the sacred war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was scorched and smoked and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of red mutiny, and throbbed with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums. And that was only one of the hells, and a small one. India glowed red that night from end to end!  Juggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out of that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and his goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark lay indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women and a child who"]]]
