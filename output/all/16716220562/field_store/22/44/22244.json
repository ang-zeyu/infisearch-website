He knew that it must amount to several dollars, and this he felt would keep him in cigarettes and pay for evenings at the theater for several days.  \"I wish I had it,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder where the ould woman kapes it.\"  The more Mike thought of it the more he coveted this money, and he set to work contriving means to get possession of it.  Finally he arranged upon a plan.  About three o'clock in the afternoon he knocked at Mrs. Mordaunt's door. She answered the knock in person.  \"Mike Rafferty!\" she said, in surprise. \"Won't you come in?\"  \"Oh, no; I can't. It's bad news I bring you about Dan.\"  \"What is it? Tell me quick, in Heaven's name!\" she exclaimed, her heart giving a great bound.  \"He's been run over, ma'am, by a hoss, in front of the Astor House, and they took him into the drug store at the corner. He wants you to go right over.\"  \"Is he--badly hurt?\" asked the agonized mother.  \"I guess he's broke his leg,\" said Mike.  In two minutes Mrs. Mordaunt, trembling with apprehension, her faltering limbs almost refusing to bear her weight, was on her way to the Astor House.  As Mike had calculated, she did not stop to lock the door.  The young scape-grace entered the deserted room, rummaged about till he found the scanty hoard reserved for the landlord, and then went off whistling.  \"Now I'll have a bully time,\" he said to himself. \"Didn't I fool the ould woman good?\"     CHAPTER IX.  MIKE'S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.   Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy acquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great nervous agitation.  \"Why, mother, what's the matter?\" asked Dan, in surprise. \"What brings you out this afternoon?\"  \"Oh, Dan!\" she gasped, \"are you hurt?\"  Dan opened his eyes in wonder. It occurred to him that his mother must have lost her mind.  \"Hurt!\" he repeated.  \"Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.\"  \"My leg broken! Who told you so?\"  \"Mike Rafferty.\"  \"Then I wish I had him here,\" said Dan, indignantly; \"I'd let him know whether my leg is broken or not. You bet I would!\"  \"Haven't you been run over, then?\"  \"Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn't be done without my knowing it.\"  \"I am so glad, so relieved!\" sighed Mrs. Mordaunt. \"I don't know how I got here, I was so agitated.\"  \"When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?\" asked Dan.  \"Only a few minutes ago. He said you had been taken into a drug store, and wanted me to come right over.\"  \"It's a mean trick he played on you, mother,\" said Dan, indignantly. \"I don't see what made him do it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt. \"He must have meant it as a joke.\"  \"A pretty poor joke. I'll get even with him for that.\"  \"I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe. I am ready to forgive him. He didn't know how much he was distressing me.\"  \"Then he ought to have known. You may forgive him if you want to; I sha'n't.\"  \"I will go home now, Dan. I feel a good deal happier than I did when I was hurrying over here.\"  \"I will go with you, mother. I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any more this afternoon. Where did you leave Mike? I hope I can come across him soon.\"  \"I left him at the door of our room.\"  \"Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?\" asked Dan.  \"No; I believe not.\"  \"Then let us go home at once. Some one might get in.\"  \"There isn't much to take, Dan,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, with a faint smile.  \"There is our rent money, mother.\"  \"I didn't think of that.\"  \"We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.\"  \"You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?\"  \"I think he would if he knew where to find it.\"  \"I wish I had brought it with me,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, in a tone of anxiety.  \"Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.\"  \"Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan. You can go quicker.\"  \"All right; I'll do it. Where is the money?\"  \"In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table.\"  \"Are the drawers locked?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then hereafter you'd better lock them. Well, I'll be off, and will meet you at the room.\"  Dan was not long in reaching his humble home. The more he thought of it, the more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother. To lose the rent money would be a serious matter. Mr. Grab hated him, he knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.  Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once to the little work-table. He pulled the drawer open without ceremony, and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found the pocket-book.  His heart gave a joyous bound.  \"It's all right, after all,\" he said. \"Mike isn't so bad as I thought him.\"  He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell. There was a twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all.  \"He's stolen the money, after all,\" he said, his heart sinking. \"What are we going to do now?\"  He waited till his mother reached home. She looked inquiringly at him. One glance told her what had happened.  \"Is it gone, Dan?\" she gasped.  \"That is all that is left,\" answered Dan, holding up the scrip.  \"Mike could not be wicked enough to take it.\"  \"Couldn't he, though? You don't know him as I do, mother. He's a mean thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field. I wish you had locked the door.\"  \"I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you were hurt.\"  \"That's why he told you.\"  \"What can we do, Dan? Mr. Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay him.\"  \"I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can. That's the first thing.\"  Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs. Rafferty's door.  She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been washing.  \"Is it you, Dan?\" she said. \"And how is your mother to-day?\"  \"Is Mike in?\" asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question.  \"No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.\"  \"Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs. Rafferty?\"  \"Yes, he did. He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could get a job, shure. Did you want him?\"  \"Yes, I did, Mrs. Rafferty. I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a bad trick on my mother.\"  \"Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!\" wailed Mrs. Rafferty. \"He's always up to something bad. Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the wash-tub all day long.\"  \"He's a bad son to you, Mrs. Rafferty.\"  \"So he is, Dan, dear. I wish he was like you. And what kind of trick has he played on your good mother?\"  \"He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg. Of course she went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he took the money from her pocket-book.\"  Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs. Rafferty knew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been implicated in thefts on several occasions.  \"Was it much, Dan?\" she asked.  \"Six or seven dollars. I can't say just how much.\"  \"Oh, what a bad bye! I don't know what to do wid him, shure.\"  \"It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow,\" continued Dan. \"It is a very serious matter.\"  \"I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear. It's a shame it is.\"  \"You are an honest woman, Mrs. Rafferty, but you ought not to make it up. I wish I could find Mike. Do you think he has really gone to Brooklyn.\"  \"Shure, I don't know. He said so.\"  \"He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent.\"  \"So he might, shure.\"  \"Well, Mrs. Rafferty, I can't stop any longer. I'll try to find him.\"  He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed to discover.  \"Don't wait supper for me, mother,\" he said. \"I'm going in search of Mike.\"  \"You won't fight with him, Dan?\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, anxiously.  \"I can't promise, mother. I will only agree to be prudent. I am not going to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you may be sure of that.\"  So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind. Mike was sure to keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would be upon his track. While our hero was searching for him, he would have plenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained unlawful possession. To punish him without regaining the contents of the lost pocket-book would be an empty triumph. In the street below Dan espied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike.  \"How are you, Terence?\" he said. \"Have you seen anything of Mike?\"  \"I saw him only a few minutes ago.\"  \"Where did he go?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"I want to see him on business.\"  \"I'll tell you where he'll be this evening.\"  \"Where?\"  \"He's going to the Old Bowery, and I'm goin' wid him.\"  \"Does he treat?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where did he get the money?\"  \"He didn't tell me,\" said Terence.  \"He's taken the rent money. I'm sure of it now,\" said Dan to himself. \"I wish I knew where to find him.\"     CHAPTER X.  DAN AS A DETECTIVE.   Dan quickly decided that if Mike had been going to Brooklyn, he would not have announced it under the circumstances.  \"He meant to send me there on a wild-goose chase,\" he reflected. \"I am not quite so green as he takes me to be.\"  Dan could not decide as easily where Mike had gone. Hood says in his poem of \"The Lost Heir,\"        \"A boy as is lost in London streets is like a needle in a bundle        of hay.\"   A hunt for a boy in the streets of New York is about equally hopeless. But Dan did not despair.  \"I'll just stroll round a little,\" he said to himself. \"Maybe I'll find him.\"  Dan bent his steps toward the Courtlandt-street Ferry.  \"Perhaps Mike has gone to Jersey City,\" he said to himself. \"Anyway, I'll go over there.\"  It was not an expensive journey. Six cents would defray Dan's expenses both ways, and he was willing to incur this expense. He meant to look about him, as something"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53345"],["title","Dan, the Newsboy (#7)"],["body","turn up by which he could turn an honest penny.  Something did turn up.  Near him in the cabin of the ferry-boat sat a gentleman of middle age, who seemed overloaded with baggage. He had two heavy carpet-bags, a satchel, and a bundle, at which he looked from time to time with a nervous and uncomfortable glance. When the boat touched shore he tried to gather his various pieces of luggage, but with indifferent success. Noticing his look of perplexity, Dan approached him, and said, respectfully:  \"Can't I assist you, sir?\"  \"I wish you would, my boy,\" said the gentleman, relieved.  \"All right, sir. I'll take one of the carpet-bags and the satchel, if you like.\"  \"Thank you; that will do nicely.\"  So the two left the boat together.  \"Where are you going, sir?\" asked Dan.  \"Do you know the wharf of the Cunard steamers?\" asked the gentleman.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Is it far off?\"  \"Not more than five or six minutes' walk,\" answered Dan.  \"Can you help me as far as that with my luggage?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I will make it worth your while, and you will be doing me a great favor besides. I was brought down to the ferry, but the rascally hackman demanded five dollars more to carry me across and land me at the Cunard pier. He thought I would have to submit to this imposition, but I was so indignant that I tried to handle all my luggage myself. I don't know how I should have managed without you.\"  \"I won't charge you so much, sir,\" said Dan, smiling.  \"It isn't for the money I cared so much as for the imposition. I would rather pay you ten dollars than the hackman five.\"  \"Be careful, sir,\" said Dan, smiling, \"or I may take advantage of your liberal offer.\"  The gentleman smiled in turn.  \"You don't look like a boy that would take advantage of a traveler.\"  \"You can't judge from appearances, sir. I have been robbed of six dollars to-day, and I might try to make it up that way.\"  \"You have been robbed! How?\"  Dan briefly related the circumstances.  \"Was it all the money your mother had?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How did you happen to be coming across the ferry?\"  \"I thought Mike might be here somewhere.\"  By this time they were in sight of the Cunard wharf.  \"Were you ever on a Cunard steamer?\" asked the gentleman.  \"No, sir.\"  \"Help me on board with my luggage, and I will show you about.\"  \"I thought the steamers generally left in the morning,\" said Dan.  \"So they do; but to-day the tide did not serve till later.\"  Dan helped Mr. Stevens down below with his luggage, and assisted him in storing them in his stateroom. He surveyed with interest the cabin, the deck, the dining-saloon, and the various arrangements.  \"Well,\" said the gentleman, smiling, \"how do you like it?\"  \"First-rate, sir.\"  \"Do you think you would like to be going with me?\"  \"Yes, sir, but for my mother.\"  \"Of course, it won't do to desert her; otherwise I might be tempted to make you an offer. I am sure you would be very useful to me.\"  \"I should like it very much, if mother did not need me.\"  Dan went up stairs with Mr. Stevens, and remained till visitors were warned that it was time to go ashore.  \"I must go, sir,\" he said.  Mr. Stevens drew a five-dollar bill from his vest pocket and handed it to Dan.  \"I haven't any change, sir,\" said Dan.  \"None is required,\" said the gentleman, smiling.  \"Do you really mean to give me five dollars, sir?\"  \"That is what the hackman wanted to charge me.\"  \"But it was too much.\"  \"It was too much for him; it is not too much for you, if I am willing to give it to you.\"  \"You are very kind, sir,\" said Dan, almost doubting the reality of his good fortune.  \"It will prove that I spoke truly when I said I didn't care for the amount of money, only for the imposition. I am really very glad to give it to you. Good-by, my boy.\"  He offered his hand. Dan shook it heartily, and, wishing him a pleasant voyage, descended the gangplank.  \"That is almost as much as Mike robbed me of,\" he said to himself. \"How lucky I came over to Jersey City! Now, if I could only get back part of the money Mike robbed me of, I should be the better off for his mean trick.\"  Dan did not immediately return to New York. He had been so fortunate that he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.  He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind, when his attention was suddenly drawn to him. Just in front of him he saw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth, and both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets. He was strolling along in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy whom he had so meanly robbed.  Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his pace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.  Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan.  \"Has he found it out?\" suggested his guilty conscience. \"Anyway, he can't prove anything. I'll bluff him off.\"  \"Hallo, Dan!\" he said, in affected cordiality. \"What brings you over here?\"  \"What brings _you_ over here, Mike?\" asked Dan, significantly.  \"I'm looking for a job,\" said Mike.  \"You look like it,\" retorted Dan, \"with both hands in your pockets and a cigar in your mouth! Times seem to be good with you. How much did that cigar cost?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood. \"A man gave it to me for holdin' his hoss.\"  Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie.  \"I thought you bought it.\"  \"I haven't got any money.\"  \"Did they let you over the ferry free, then?\"  \"Oh, I had money enough for that.\"  \"I guess you have got more.\"  \"No, I haven't. Ten cents was all I had.\"  \"Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?\" asked Dan.  Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this unexpected question.  \"What do you mane?\" he stammered.  \"Terence told me you had invited him.\"  \"Then he lies!\" said Mike, his self-assurance returning. \"He invited me.\"  \"Look here, Mike Rafferty,\" said Dan, out of patience; \"that won't go down! Terence told the truth. I know where you got the money you were going to treat him with.\"  \"Where, then?\"  \"From my mother's pocket-book.\"  \"It's a lie!\" blustered Mike.  \"It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making any more trouble, I'll have you arrested.\"  \"You can't. We're in Jersey----\"  \"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.\"  \"I didn't take the money,\" said Mike, sullenly.  \"You did, and you know it,\" said Dan, firmly. \"Give me what you have left, and I'll make no trouble about it. If you don't, you're booked for another term at the island.\"  Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and finally extracted from him four dollars and a half. The rest Mike pretended he had spent. He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough to take him to the Old Bowery.  On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had received on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a farewell shot.  \"How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?\"  Mike did not deign a reply.  \"That is my first appearance as a detective,\" thought Dan. \"It seems to pay.\"     CHAPTER XI.  DAN HAS ANOTHER ADVENTURE.   It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found himself again in front of the Astor House.  \"Shall I buy any evening papers?\" Dan asked himself. \"No, I won't. I've made enough to satisfy me for one day.\"  Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying crowds.  He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.  He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and he felt like a gentleman of leisure.  All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob. It proceeded from a little flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.  \"What's the matter, Fanny?\" asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the little flower-girl was one of his acquaintances. \"Haven't you sold as many bouquets as usual?\"  \"Yes,\" said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, \"I've sold more.\"  \"Then what's the matter? Has any one been teasing you?\"  \"No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me.\"  \"Let me see it.\"  Dan inspected the piece. He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in appearance and unmistakably bad.  \"When did you take it?\"  \"Just now. A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave me this to change.\"  \"Didn't you see that it was bad?\"  \"I didn't look at it till afterward. Then it was too late.\"  \"So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?\"  \"Yes,\" said the little girl, again beginning to sob.  \"How many bouquets had you sold?\"  \"Seven.\"  \"Then you have less money than when you began?\"  \"Yes, Dan.\"  \"Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?\"  \"Yes, for he hurried away.\"  \"Which way did he go?\"  \"Down Broadway.\"  \"Maybe he was going to Jersey City.\"  \"No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.\"  \"Then he was going to Brooklyn. How did he look?\"  \"He was short and had red hair.\"  \"How was he dressed?\"  \"He had on a gray suit.\"  \"How long ago did this happen?\"  \"About five minutes.\"  \"Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him. Stay here till I come back.\"  Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run.  \"I hope he won't have taken the boat,\" he said to himself. \"If he has I shall lose him.\"  Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but did not stop to apologize. He ran into a fat gentleman who looked daggers at him, but kept on.  Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat as it was leaving the New York pier.  Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.  \"He may be on board the boat. I'll go forward,\" said Dan to himself.  He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward deck. The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in Brooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.  Dan looked about him for a time"]]]
