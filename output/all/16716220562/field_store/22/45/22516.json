He looked grave. \"You must take care, honey,\" he said, lowering his voice. \"They suspect me now of communicating with the Governor and McCulloch. Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and to stand by your colors. But this sort of thing,\" said he, stroking the gown, \"this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only sets spies upon us. Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes standing in the alley last night for three hours.\"  \"Pa,\" cried the girl, \"I'm so sorry.\" Suddenly searching his face with a swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and lined. \"Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must not go off on any more trips.\"  The Colonel shook his head sadly.  \"It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant duties --Jinny--\"  \"Yes?\"  The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr, Hopper, who was still standing at the bottom of the steps. He checked himself abruptly as Eliphalet pulled off his hat,  \"Howdy, Colonel?\" he said.  Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen by a presentiment. As she saw her father start down the steps, she yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she knew not what. Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly as ever. And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor.  \"Won't--won't you come in, Mr. Hopper?\"  Virginia started  \"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel,\" he answered; easily. \"I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter.\"  Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs. Gaining her room, she shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her there. The man's face had all at once become a terror. She threw herself on the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still leering at her with a new confidence. Presently she grew calmer; rising, she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the stairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her. She had never been in fear of a man before. She hearkened over the banisters for his voice, heard it, and summoned all her courage. How cowardly she had been to leave her father alone with him.  Eliphalet stayed to tea. It mattered little to him that Mrs. Colfax ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at that lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory. It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed what it cost her. Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner, and gloated over that likewise. Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's pain is missed by your beast of prey. The Colonel was gravely polite, but preoccupied. Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a guest. He offered Mr. Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would have given it to a governor.  \"Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke,\" he said, waving the bog away.  Mrs. Colfax flung herself out of the room.  It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered.  \"The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr. Hopper,\" his landlady remarked, \"where have you been so late?\"  \"I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea with 'em,\" he answered, striving to speak casually.  Miss Crane lingered in Mrs. Abner Reed's room later than usual that night.     CHAPTER III  THE SCOURGE OF WAR  \"Virginia,\" said Mrs. Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, \"I am going back to Bellegarde today. I really cannot put up with such a person as Comyn had here to tea last night.\"  \"Very well, Aunt Lillian. At what time shall I order the carriage?\"  The lady was surprised. It is safe to say that she had never accurately gauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection for her aunt through Clarence, held in check. Only a moment since Mrs. Colfax had beheld her niece. Now there had arisen in front of her a tall person of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively. It was not what Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade. Mrs. Colfax sank into a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had thrust into her hand.  \"What--what is it?\" she gasped. \"I cannot read.\"  \"There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek,\" said Virginia, in an emotionless voice. \"General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we should be thankful. More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their way here. They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from Springfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to eat or drink.\"  \"And--Clarence?\"  \"His name is not there.\"  \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Mrs. Colfax. \"Are the Yankees beaten?\"  \"Yes,\" said Virginia, coldly. \"At what time shall I order the carriage to take you to Bellegarde?\"  Mrs. Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown. \"Oh, let me stay,\" she cried, \"let me stay. Clarence may be with them.\"  Virginia looked down at her without pity.  \"As you please, Aunt Lillian,\" she answered. \"You know that you may always stay here. I only beg of you one thing, that when you have anything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it before Pa. He has enough to worry him.\"  \"Oh, Jinny,\" sobbed the lady, in tears again, \"how can you be so cruel at such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?\"  But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for Colonel Carvel's house. All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which she had long denied herself. At evening she went to the station at Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed back by the soldiers, until the trains came in. Alas, the heavy basket which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again. The first hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.  The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have their hearts wrung. The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun reeked with white wash and paint. The miserable men lay on the hard floor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle. Those were the first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to appal us. Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed on the field weeks before.  Mrs. Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an ordeal. She spoke the truth, for Mr. Carvel had to assist her to the waiting-room. Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia busy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed eyes were following her every motion. His frontiersman's clothes, stained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body. At Virginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh water, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands. It was Mr. Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe some of the broth from Virginia's basket. For the first time since the war began something of happiness entered her breast.  It was Mr. Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged the place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to work in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down the names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night writing to them.  They put a mattress under the Arkansan. Virginia did not leave him until he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken face. Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that rose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to join her father and aunt in the carriage below.  The panic of flight had seized her. She felt that another little while in this heated, horrible place would drive her mad. She was almost at the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.  An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face. He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn. A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right band. The left sleeve was empty. Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity, thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there. Her face the girl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man. The sweetness of her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning that he might listen:  \"You have a wife?\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"And a child?\"  The answer came so painfully.  \"A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.\"  \"I shall write to your wife,\" said the lady, so gently that Virginia could scarce hear, \"and tell her that you are cared for. Where does she live?\"  He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota. Then he added, \"God bless you, lady.\"  Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them. The lady turned her face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes. Virginia felt them wet in her own. Her worship was not given to many. Nobility, character, efficiency,-all were written on that face. Nobility spoke in the large features, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes. Virginia had seen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her.  \"Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?\"  The surgeon got down beside her and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5393"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 06 (#6)"],["body","the man's pulse. The eyes closed. For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head. \"He has fainted,\" he said.  \"Do you think he can be saved?\" asked the lady again. The surgeon smiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of amputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand, a clear eye and brain, and a good heart.  \"My dear Mrs. Brice,\" he said, \"I shall be glad to get you permission to take him, but we must first make him worth the taking. Another hour would have been too late.\" He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and then added, \"We must have one more to help us.\"  Just then some one touched Virginia's arm. It was her father.  \"I am afraid we must go, dear,\" he said, \"your aunt is getting impatient.\"  \"Won't you please go without me, Pa?\" she asked. \"Perhaps I can be of some use.\"  The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went away. The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of astonishment. It was Mrs. Brice's searching gaze that brought the color to the girl's, face.  \"Thank you, my dear,\" she said simply.  As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the carriage, Colonel Carvel came back. For two reeking hours he stood against the newly plastered wall. Even he was surprised at the fortitude and skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly cut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough bandages. At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary surgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to him, his thanks to the two ladies.  Virginia stood up, faint and dizzy. The work of her hands had sustained her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come. She went down the stairs on her father's arm, and out into the air. All at once she knew that Mrs. Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.  \"My dear?\" she was saying, \"God will reward you for this act. You have taught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles.\"  Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing. The mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was filled with a longing unutterable. It was not because Margaret Brice was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with hers --whom she saw in her dreams. And yet now some of Stephen's traits seemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation. Virginia had labored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His work, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters. One brief second had been needful for the spell.  The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished him, and Mrs. Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and watch by the sergeant's pallet. Virginia's eyes followed her up the stairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage. With her foot on the step Virginia paused.  \"Pa,\" she said, \"do you think it would be possible to get them to let us take that Arkansan into our house?\"  \"Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like,\" said the Colonel. \"Here he comes now, and Anne.\"  It was Virginia who put the question to him.  \"My dear,\" replied that gentleman, patting her, \"I would do anything in the world for you. I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon. Virginia,\" he added, soberly, \"it is such acts as yours to-day that give us courage to live in these times.\"  Anne kissed her friend.  \"Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men. What am I saying?\" she cried. \"They are your men, too. This horrible war cannot last. It cannot last. It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on the face of the commanding general when Mr. Brinsmade at length got to him with her request. This was before the days when the wounded arrived by the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to throw out of gear the workings of a great system. But the General, had had his eye on Mr. Carvel from the first. Therefore he smiled.  \"Colonel Carvel,\" said Mr. Brinsmade, with dignity, \"is a gentleman. When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.\"  \"Even to an enemy,\" the General put in, \"By George, Brinsmade, unless I knew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself. Well, well, he may have his Arkansan.\"  Mr. Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview his Excellency, the Commander in-chief. It was like obtaining an audience with the Sultan or the Czar. Citizens who had been prominent in affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men like Mr. Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows in one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain. The General might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough. His European notions of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter. He was a royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a glittering guard. It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of thing. That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less in communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two hours to mop their brows.  On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette, you discovered a good man and a patriot. It was far from being the General's fault that Mr. Hopper and others made money in mules and worthless army blankets. Such things always have been, and always will be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep of security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword. We shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army of comfortable size will save millions in the end. So much for Democracy when it becomes a catchword.  The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the Western Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing. Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with truth its doings. The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler hero than he was never under a man's hand. For the glory of generals fades beside his glory.  It was Mr. Brinsmade's carriage that brought Mrs. Brice home from her trying day in the hospital. Stephen, just returned from drill at Verandah hall, met her at the door. She would not listen to his entreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the porch behind the house, where there was a little breeze.  \"Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen,\" she said. \"It was while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost his arm. I hope we shall be allowed to have him here. He is suffering horribly.\"  \"What happened, mother?\" he asked.  \"It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow,\" she said. \"I saw the--the flies around him. And as I got down beside him to fan them away I had such a queer sensation. I knew that some one was standing behind me, looking at me. Then Dr. Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the man, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get help. Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice. It was that Miss Carvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you bought Hester, and to whose party you once went. Do you remember that they offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?\"  \"Yes,\" said Stephen.  \"She is a wonderful creature,\" his mother continued. \"Such personality, such life! And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to make? They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them.\" The good lady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making. \"I saw how it happened. The girl was carried away by her pity. And, my dear, her capability astonished me. One might have thought that she had always been a nurse. The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must it have been for her. After the operation was over, I followed her downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the building, waiting for their carriage. I felt that I must say something to her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done. When I saw her there, I scarcely knew what to say. Words seemed so inadequate. It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that place since morning. I am sure she could not have borne it much longer. Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so when I took it, and she was very pale. She usually has color, I believe. Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such politeness. He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked, and he brought a mattress for us. I have heard that his house is watched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating with the Confederate leaders.\" Mrs. Brice sighed. He seems such a fine character. I hope they will not get into any trouble.\"  \"I hope not, mother,\" said Stephen.  It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the Iron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards drawn up. On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their countrymen. Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands. The tears ran on his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion. Judge Whipple, grim and silent, stood apart. But he uncovered his head with the others when the train rolled in. Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes were piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of Captain Carl Richter.  Far from the land"]]]
