Now, in order to verify the prophet's words, I will refer you to the book of Omni, Book of Mormon, which says:   \"And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he  dwelt with them for the space of nine moons\" (months).  Coriantumr, weak, wounded and alone, had to wend his way about 3,000 miles to Zarahemla, where he remained until his death and was buried by this strange people.  Thus ended two great nations around this historic hill, in fulfillment of God's word, as found in the Book of Mormon, page 474:   \"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it  [and this will apply to all people in every age] shall be free from  bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven,  if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ. I  will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins, but thou shalt not  sin any more, for ye shall remember that my spirit shall not always  strive with man; wherefore if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe, ye  shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.\"  This has been fulfilled to the very letter with both nations.  CHAPTER III.  The Angel that had been foretold would \"Fly through the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to Preach unto them that Dwell on the Earth\" appears to Joseph Smith.--The Golden Plates are Given into his Charge.  The memorable twenty-second day of September, 1827, was the day appointed by the angel Moroni to meet Joseph Smith on the Hill Cumorah. There he was to receive the gold plates, the breast-plate and the Urim and Thummim. The accompanying shows Joseph grown to maturity, being no longer a lad of tender years as when he received his first vision. He now stands in his noble, dignified manhood, in the twenty-second year of his age. Before being entrusted with those valuable plates it was necessary that he should become experienced with regard to such sacred matters. For more than four years previous to this event he had at intervals met the angel and been instructed by him. This was during the important period between boyhood and manhood, when the mind is easily impressed. During all that time, he had not been permitted to take the plates away.  The appointed time now having come, we see him receiving the treasure, as pictured in the engraving. He is holding the book in his hands, while the breast-plate rests on the edge of the stone box, with the sword of Laban near by. The angel, holding the Urim and Thummim, is in the act of delivering it unto Joseph, and while doing so charges him as follows:   \"Now you have got the record into your own hands, and you are but a  young man: therefore, you will have to be watchful and faithful to  your trust, or you will be overpowered by wicked men; for they will  lay every plan and scheme possible to get it away from you; and if you  do not take heed continually, they will succeed. While it was in my  hands, I could keep it and no man had power to take it away; but now I  give it up to you. Beware, and look well to your ways, and you shall  have power to retain it, until the time for it to be translated.\"  In 1834 I first listened to this Prophet of God, who related this vision he had been favored with. The honesty and power of his expression carried conviction with it.  I will now introduce a few Bible quotations in order to prove that just such an event as the one represented by the accompanying illustration was to take place in the latter days. Zechariah in his 2nd chapter says:   \"And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another  angel went out to meet him.   \"And said unto him, run, speak to this  young man, saying, Jerusalem  shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men  and cattle therein.\"  In order to discover further the mind of God's inspired prophet, we will turn to his 8th chapter, which reads as follows:   \"Again the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,   \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great  jealousy. * * *   \"Thus saith the Lord; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the  midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth.   \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, there shall yet old men and old women  dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his  hand for very age.   \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing  in the streets thereof.   \"* * * Behold I will save my people from the east country, and from  the west country;   \"And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of  Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.\"  Soon after the message of the angel to the young man Joseph, he, in obedience to God's command, organized the church. In due time there were Twelve Apostles, and he appointed two of those Apostles on a mission to Jerusalem. Upon Mount Olivet, one of the apostles,--Orson Hyde,--offered a dedicatory prayer unto God, the Eternal Father.  In that prayer he supplicated God to remember his promises made to Father Abraham concerning this dry and barren land, and Abraham's seed which should inhabit this thirsty country, and who had wandered as strangers in a strange land. The land had become barren because of the sins of those who, in their ignorance, crucified God's Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ. He further pleaded:   \"And as Jesus, thy Son, in his sorrowful and trying hours, cried,  'Lord, forgive them, they know not what they do!' so do thou, O God,  have mercy on them and let the promises of the prophets come up in  remembrance before thee. Be pleased, O Father, to send the rains on  these parched lands; and may the dews fall upon the hills and valleys,  that the land may again teem with plenty, and cities be built up unto  the Lord our God.\"  This is the substance of the supplication of the Apostle who dedicated the land of Palestine. Since then the way is being prepared with a railroad from the Mediterranean Sea to Jerusalem; and lo! the time has come for God's mercy, as foretold by Isaiah, 40th chapter:   \"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye  comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is  accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of  the Lord's hand double for all her sins.\"  Joel, another of God's ancient prophets, prophecying of future events, in 2nd chapter, says:   \"Fear not, O land; be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in  the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,  and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and  the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of  wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. * * * And ye  shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord  your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall  never be ashamed.\"  Realizing that the words of the prophets Isaiah and Joel will have a literal fulfillment, we can readily conceive of the way being thus prepared for the support of the hosts that are soon to fill the streets of Jerusalem; for without the early and the latter rains, this land, for so many generations barren, could not be redeemed. Indeed, the words of those who crucified the Savior, or who consented to his death, are brought forcibly to the minds of Christians:   \"His blood be upon us and our children.\"_--Matt.27:25_  Because of their wicked desires, desolation has rested upon this land which once flowed with milk and honey. But, thank God! a pardoning time is being ushered in. The angel spoken of by Zechariah has come with the glad tidings.  [Image: The Angel Moroni Delivering the Golden Plates to Joseph Smith.]  John, the Revelator, also, was permitted to behold an angel who had a message to deliver. Who can truthfully say the angel he saw is not the very one Zechariah said should speak to the young man?   \"And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having  the everlasting gospel [the Book of Mormon says it contains the  everlasting gospel] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and  to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people; saying with  a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his  judgment is come; and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the  sea, and the fountains of waters.\"_--Revelation, 14,6-7._  In Zechariah, 2nd chapter, 8th verse, it says:   \"Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for lo, I come, and I will  dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be  joined to the Lord in that day.\"  What day? The day in which the angel was to speak to the _young_ (not old) man. In Zion there are now over twenty nationalities who are joined to the Lord.  Zechariah in the same chapter says:   \"And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the Holy Land and  shall choose Jerusalem again. Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord;  for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.\"  These things are soon to take place, when the Jews will be gathered.   \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter of Jerusalem;  behold thy king cometh unto thee.\"_--Zec. 9, 9._  He will come this second time, when:   \"They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.\"_--Zec. 12,10._  Again, this prophet says in chapter 15, 6:   \"And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?  Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of  my friends.\"   \"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David  and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\"_--Zec. 12, 1._  The same book, 14th chapter, says:   \"His feet shall stand in that day upon the _Mount of Olives_.\"  It appears sufficiently plain that God has set"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],["title","Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#6)"],["body","hand again the second time to gather not only the _Jews,_ but the _House_ of Israel.  In Isaiah, 11th chapter, it is clearly stated that there is to be an ensign to the _people_; to it shall the _gentiles_ seek. And the next verse says that in that day the Lord will set his hand _again_ the _second_ time to gather his people.   \"And he shall set up an ensign for the _nations,_ and shall assemble  the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the  four corners of the earth.\"_--Isaiah, 11,12._  We learn more perfectly in the tenth verse that the Gentiles as well as the Jews are remembered.  Isaiah, 2nd chapter, says:   \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the  Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains.\"  Following on we find that two places are distinctly spoken of: _Zion,_ from whence the law of God is to go forth; and the word of the Lord from JERUSALEM. And as Jesus came to his own (the Jews) first, and to the Gentiles last, so now the first shall be last and the last shall be first. And in our day Joseph Smith has been directed by the Lord to gather the people to Zion, as so vividly portrayed by the prophet who saw the angel who should run and speak to the young man.  Having introduced these Bible evidences, we shall repeat the testimony of three witnesses whom God raised up, and who, until their death, were always true and faithful to their testimony:   \"Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto  whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the  Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain  this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of  the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who  came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we also know that  they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice  hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work  is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which  are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of  God, and not of man. And we declare with words of solemness, that an  angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our  eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon;  and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord  Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are  true: and it is marvelous in our eyes; nevertheless, the voice of the  Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be  obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these  things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid  our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the  judgment seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the  heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the  Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.   OLIVER COWDERY, DAVID WHITMER, MARTIN HARRIS.  Notwithstanding every one of these three witnesses withdrew from the Church in 1838, yet they remained firm in their declarations to the truth of their testimony. Nine years afterwards Oliver Cowdery returned to the church and was rebaptized. In 1871 Martin Harris came to Utah, and he also was rebaptized. David Whitmer, who died at Richmond, Ray Co., Mo., was the only one of the three who died without rebaptism. He had resided in that place nearly fifty years, and many leading citizens of Richmond signed their names, which were published, testifying that David Whitmer was an honorable citizen whose veracity was unquestioned.  I can testify to the truth of these statements, for I visited him in 1870, also in 1879, and again in 1886. I was acquainted with him in 1833 and also in 1838 when he was disfellowshipped by the Church at Far West, Mo. It was no secret among those who knew him at his home in Richmond that he always stood firm to his testimony, as above stated. The other two witnesses were equally valiant, both while in full fellowship and after withdrawing from the Church, and I defy the world to impeach either of those three witnesses.  Joseph Smith could not have accomplished the work entrusted to him without the aid of the Urim and Thummim. It was therefore provided for him. Anciently it was used by God's servants--His prophets, seers and revelators. The language engraven upon the gold plates is Reformed Egyptian and is spoken of in the Book of Mormon, which says:   \"And now behold, we have written this according to our knowledge  in the characters which are called among us the Reformed Egyptian,  being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of  speech.\"_--Book of Mormon, p.570, N. E._  And the thirty-fourth verse says:   \"But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and that none  other people knoweth our language; therefore hath he prepared means  for the interpretation thereof.\"  There is still another instance worth mentioning. King Limhi was in possession of twenty-four gold plates, and desired to have them translated. Ammon told the king:   \"I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man who can translate the  records; for he has wherewith that he can look and translate all  records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God, and the  things are called interpreters.\"_--Book of Mormon, p. 30, N. E._   \"And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which  were fastened into the two rims of a bow. Now these things were  prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation  to generation, for the purpose of interpreting language.\"_--Book of  Mormon, p. 228, 13-14 v._   \"And whosoever has these things is called Seer, after the manner of  old times.\"_--Book of Mormon, p. 228, 16 v._  By the above we learn that the Urim and Thummim or interpreters was anciently used, and answered the description of those that Joseph is represented as receiving.  The Prophet's mother was permitted to see and handle them and describes them thus:   \"I found that they consisted of two smooth, three-cornered diamonds,  set in glass, and the glasses were set in silver bows which were  connected with each other in much the same way as old-fashioned  spectacles.\"  Martin Harris described them just the same, only he said they were larger than the ordinary spectacles.  Some have marveled at the Lord's choice in selecting one so young and unlearned as Joseph Smith to perform so great a work. However, the Lord's ways are not man's ways. For,   \"As the Heavens are higher than the earth, so are the Lord's ways  higher than man's ways.\"  As an instance we read how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel unto Jesse, saying he had provided a king among his sons. And how, when Samuel looked on Eliab, he thought surely the Lord's anointed was before him. But the Lord said unto Samuel:   \"Look not at his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because  I have refused him; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man  looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\"  After seven sons of Jesse had been presented, Samuel asked, \"Are here all thy children?\" to which Jesse replied, \"There remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep.\" And he it was whom the Lord had chosen should be anointed king. Samuel did the bidding of the Lord, and we learn that the spirit of God rested upon David, and he became a man after God's own heart.  In this connection we will not pass by unnoticed God's mighty power in raising up the great prophet Moses, as a deliverer of His chosen people from under the hand of Pharoah, the oppressor and king of Egypt. In this case, His power was manifested in overruling Pharoah's midwives even unto disobedience of their wicked king in preserving the male children of the promised seed of Abraham, as found in the 1st chapter of Exodus:   \"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt  commanded them, but saved the men children alive.\" [That is, the  Hebrew children, for they were the ones the king sought to destroy.]   \"Therefore, God dealt well with the midwives; and the people  multiplied, and waxed very mighty.   \"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made  them houses.   \"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, every son that is born  ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.\"  Where is the mother that will not join in saying that King Pharoah was an oppressor, a tyrant and a murderer? Yet God's ways are so kind, good merciful and wise that we are led to praise His holy name forever. God raised up a Moses, whose mother kept him hid three months, after which she put him in an ark of bulrushes, while his sister acted as a spy and watched over him at a distance. King Pharoah's daughter to her bath drew near; the babe's cries inclined her heart to the young Hebrew, the spy was at hand, the real mother was procured, who received pay for minding her own child. Moses finally became the adopted son of the king's daughter, whom she named Moses, because she drew him out of the water, as found in the 2nd chapter of Exodus. The life and history of Moses is well known to every Bible student, as the deliverer of ancient Israel, and I ask, is it more marvelous to accept a modern Moses in the person of Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom God raised up in our day?  Again, if the selection by Jesus of Peter the fisherman to be the chief apostle had taken place in our day, it would probably have seemed as surprising as the choosing of Joseph Smith for his work. The fellow apostles of Peter were all unlearned, except Paul.  It is just as easy for our Lord to accomplish His purposes now through the agency of unlearned men as it was anciently. God _has_ established a Church through the agency of this young man, which has caused the wisdom of the wise to perish.  The story of Joseph Smith'"]]]
