I have seen its deepest shadows; and,\" he added in a low tone \"how glorious its light can be.\"     CHAPTER VII.  An hour later, Bent-Anat and her train of followers stood before the gate of the House of Seti.  Swift as a ball thrown from a man's hand, a runner had sprung forward and hurried on to announce the approach of the princess to the chief priest. She stood alone in her chariot, in advance of all her companions, for Pentaur had found a place with Paaker.  At the gate of the temple they were met by the head of the haruspices.  The great doors of the pylon were wide open, and afforded a view into the forecourt of the sanctuary, paved with polished squares of stone, and surrounded on three sides with colonnades.  The walls and architraves, the pillars and the fluted cornice, which slightly curved in over the court, were gorgeous with many colored figures and painted decorations. In the middle stood a great sacrificial altar, on which burned logs of cedar wood, whilst fragrant balls of Kyphi       [Kyphi was a celebrated Egyptian incense.  Recipes for its      preparation have been preserved in the papyrus of Ebers, in the      laboratories of the temples, and elsewhere.  Parthey had three      different varieties prepared by the chemist, L. Voigt, in Berlin.      Kyphi after the formula of Dioskorides was the best.  It consisted      of rosin, wine, rad, galangae, juniper berries, the root of the      aromatic rush, asphalte, mastic, myrrh, Burgundy grapes, and honey.]  were consumed by the flames, filling the wide space with their heavy perfume.  Around, in semi-circular array, stood more than a hundred white-robed priests, who all turned to face the approaching princess, and sang heart-rending songs of lamentation.  Many of the inhabitants of the Necropolis had collected on either side of the lines of sphinxes, between which the princess drove up to the Sanctuary.  But none asked what these songs of lamentation might signify, for about this sacred place lamentation and mystery for ever lingered. \"Hail to the child of Rameses!\"--\"All hail to the daughter of the Sun!\" rang from a thousand throats; and the assembled multitude bowed almost to the earth at the approach of the royal maiden.  At the pylon, the princess descended from her chariot, and preceded by the chief of the haruspices, who had gravely and silently greeted her, passed on to the door of the temple.  But as she prepared to cross the forecourt, suddenly, without warning, the priests' chant swelled to a terrible, almost thundering loudness, the clear, shrill voice of the Temple scholars rising in passionate lament, supported by the deep and threatening roll of the basses.  Bent-Anat started and checked her steps.  Then she walked on again.  But on the threshold of the door, Ameni, in full pontifical robes, stood before her in the way, his crozier extended as though to forbid her entrance.  \"The advent of the daughter of Rameses in her purity,\" he cried in loud and passionate tones, \"augurs blessing to this sanctuary; but this abode of the Gods closes its portals on the unclean, be they slaves or princes. In the name of the Immortals, from whom thou art descended, I ask thee, Bent-Anat, art thou clean, or hast thou, through the touch of the unclean, defiled thyself and contaminated thy royal hand?\"  Deep scarlet flushed the maiden's cheeks, there was a rushing sound in her ears as of a stormy sea surging close beside her, and her bosom rose and fell in passionate emotion.  The kingly blood in her veins boiled wildly; she felt that an unworthy part had been assigned to her in a carefully-premeditated scene; she forgot her resolution to accuse herself of uncleanness, and already her lips were parted in vehement protest against the priestly assumption that so deeply stirred her to rebellion, when Ameni, who placed himself directly in front of the Princess, raised his eyes, and turned them full upon her with all the depths of their indwelling earnestness.  The words died away, and Bent-Anat stood silent, but she endured the gaze, and returned it proudly and defiantly.  The blue veins started in Ameni's forehead; yet he repressed the resentment which was gathering like thunder clouds in his soul, and said, with a voice that gradually deviated more and more from its usual moderation:  \"For the second time the Gods demand through me, their representative: Hast thou entered this holy place in order that the Celestials may purge thee of the defilement that stains thy body and soul?\"  \"My father will communicate the answer to thee,\" replied Bent-Anat shortly and proudly.  \"Not to me,\" returned Ameni, \"but to the Gods, in whose name I now command thee to quit this sanctuary, which is defiled by thy presence.\"  Bent-Anat's whole form quivered.  \"I will go,\" she said with sullen dignity.  She turned to recross the gateway of the Pylon.  At the first step her glance met the eye of the poet.  As one to whom it is vouchsafed to stand and gaze at some great prodigy, so Pentaur had stood opposite the royal maiden, uneasy and yet fascinated, agitated, yet with secretly uplifted soul.  Her deed seemed to him of boundless audacity, and yet one suited to her true and noble nature.  By her side, Ameni, his revered and admired master, sank into insignificance; and when she turned to leave the temple, his hand was raised indeed to hold her back, but as his glance met hers, his hand refused its office, and sought instead to still the throbbing of his overflowing heart.  The experienced priest, meanwhile, read the features of these two guileless beings like an open book.  A quickly-formed tie, he felt, linked their souls, and the look which he saw them exchange startled him. The rebellious princess had glanced at the poet as though claiming approbation for her triumph, and Pentaur's eyes had responded to the appeal.  One instant Ameni paused.  Then he cried: \"Bent-Anat!\"  The princess turned to the priest, and looked at him gravely and enquiringly.  Ameni took a step forward, and stood between her and the poet.  \"Thou wouldst challenge the Gods to combat,\" he said sternly.  \"That is bold; but such daring it seems to me has grown up in thee because thou canst count on an ally, who stands scarcely farther from the Immortals than I myself.  Hear this:--to thee, the misguided child, much may be forgiven.  But a servant of the Divinity,\" and with these words he turned a threatening glance on Pentaur--\"a priest, who in the war of free-will against law becomes a deserter, who forgets his duty and his oath--he will not long stand beside thee to support thee, for he--even though every God had blessed him with the richest gifts--he is damned.  We drive him from among us, we curse him, we--\"  At these words Bent-Anat looked now at Ameni, trembling with excitement, now at Pentaur standing opposite to her.  Her face was red and white by turns, as light and shade chase each other on the ground when at noon-day a palm-grove is stirred by a storm.  The poet took a step towards her.  She felt that if he spoke it would be to defend all that she had done, and to ruin himself.  A deep sympathy, a nameless anguish seized her soul, and before Pentaur could open his lips, she had sunk slowly down before Ameni, saying in low tones:  \"I have sinned and defiled myself; thou hast said it--as Pentaur said it by the hut of the paraschites.  Restore me to cleanness, Ameni, for I am unclean.\"  Like a flame that is crushed out by a hand, so the fire in the high- priest's eye was extinguished.  Graciously, almost lovingly, he looked down on the princess, blessed her and conducted her before the holy of holies, there had clouds of incense wafted round her, anointed her with the nine holy oils, and commanded her to return to the royal castle.  Yet, said he, her guilt was not expiated; she should shortly learn by what prayers and exercises she might attain once more to perfect purity before the Gods, of whom he purposed to enquire in the holy place.  During all these ceremonies the priests stationed in the forecourt continued their lamentations.  The people standing before the temple listened to the priest's chant, and interrupted it from time to time with ringing cries of wailing, for already a dark rumor of what was going on within had spread among the multitude.  The sun was going down.  The visitors to the Necropolis must soon be leaving it, and Bent-Anat, for whose appearance the people impatiently waited, would not show herself.  One and another said the princess had been cursed, because she had taken remedies to the fair and injured Uarda, who was known to many of them.  Among the curious who had flocked together were many embalmers, laborers, and humble folk, who lived in the Necropolis.  The mutinous and refractory temper of the Egyptians, which brought such heavy suffering on them under their later foreign rulers, was aroused, and rising with every minute.  They reviled the pride of the priests, and their senseless, worthless, institutions.  A drunken soldier, who soon reeled back into the tavern which he had but just left, distinguished himself as ringleader, and was the first to pick up a heavy stone to fling at the huge brass-plated temple gates.  A few boys followed his example with shouts, and law-abiding men even, urged by the clamor of fanatical women, let themselves be led away to stone-flinging and words of abuse.  Within the House of Seti the priests' chant went on uninterruptedly; but at last, when the noise of the crowd grew louder, the great gate was thrown open, and with a solemn step Ameni, in full robes, and followed by twenty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 02 (#8)"],["body","stophori--[An order of priests]--who bore images of the Gods and holy symbols on their shoulders--Ameni walked into the midst of the crowd.  All were silent.  \"Wherefore do you disturb our worship?\"  he asked loudly and calmly.  A roar of confused cries answered him, in which the frequently repeated name of Bent-Anat could alone be distinguished.  Ameni preserved his immoveable composure, and, raising his crozier, he cried--  \"Make way for the daughter of Rameses, who sought and has found purification from the Gods, who behold the guilt of the highest as of the lowest among you.  They reward the pious, but they punish the offender. Kneel down and let us pray that they may forgive you, and bless both you and your children.\"  Ameni took the holy Sistrum       [A rattling metal instrument used by the Egyptians in the service of      the Gods.  Many specimens are extant in Museums.  Plutarch describes      it correctly, thus: \"The Sistrum is rounded above, and the loop      holds the four bars which are shaken.\"  On the bend of the Sistrum      they often set the head of a cat with a human face.]  from one of the attendant pastophori, and held it on high; the priests behind him raised a solemn hymn, and the crowd sank on their knees; nor did they move till the chant ceased and the high-priest again cried out:  \"The Immortals bless you by me their servant.  Leave this spot and make way for the daughter of Rameses.\"  With these words he withdrew into the temple, and the patrol, without meeting with any opposition, cleared the road guarded by Sphinxes which led to the Nile.  As Bent-Anat mounted her chariot Ameni said \"Thou art the child of kings. The house of thy father rests on the shoulders of the people.  Loosen the old laws which hold them subject, and the people will conduct themselves like these fools.\"  Ameni retired.  Bent-Anat slowly arranged the reins in her hand, her eyes resting the while on the poet, who, leaning against a door-post, gazed at her in beatitude.  She let her whip fall to the ground, that he might pick it up and restore it to her, but he did not observe it.  A runner sprang forward and handed it to the princess, whose horses started off, tossing themselves and neighing.  Pentaur remained as if spell-bound, standing by the pillar, till the rattle of the departing wheels on the flag-way of the Avenue of Sphinxes had altogether died away, and the reflection of the glowing sunset painted the eastern hills with soft and rosy hues.  The far-sounding clang of a brass gong roused the poet from his ecstasy. It was the tomtom calling him to duty, to the lecture on rhetoric which at this hour he had to deliver to the young priests.  He laid his left hand to his heart, and pressed his right hand to his forehead, as if to collect in its grasp his wandering thoughts; then silently and mechanically he went towards the open court in which his disciples awaited him.  But instead of, as usual, considering on the way the subject he was to treat, his spirit and heart were occupied with the occurrences of the last few hours.  One image reigned supreme in his imagination, filling it with delight--it was that of the fairest woman, who, radiant in her royal dignity and trembling with pride, had thrown herself in the dust for his sake.  He felt as if her action had invested her whole being with a new and princely worth, as if her glance had brought light to his inmost soul, he seemed to breathe a freer air, to be borne onward on winged feet.  In such a mood he appeared before his hearers.  When he found himself confronting all the the well-known faces, he remembered what it was he was called upon to do.  He supported himself against the wall of the court, and opened the papyrus-roll handed to him by his favorite pupil, the young Anana.  It was the book which twenty-four hours ago he had promised to begin upon.  He looked now upon the characters that covered it, and felt that he was unable to read a word.  With a powerful effort he collected himself, and looking upwards tried to find the thread he had cut at the end of yesterday's lecture, and intended to resume to-day; but between yesterday and to-day, as it seemed to him, lay a vast sea whose roaring surges stunned his memory and powers of thought.  His scholars, squatting cross-legged on reed mats before him, gazed in astonishment on their silent master who was usually so ready of speech, and looked enquiringly at each other.  A young priest whispered to his neighbor, \"He is praying--\" and Anana noticed with silent anxiety the strong hand of his teacher clutching the manuscript so tightly that the slight material of which it consisted threatened to split.  At last Pentaur looked down; he had found a subject.  While he was looking upwards his gaze fell on the opposite wall, and the painted name of the king with the accompanying title \"the good God\" met his eye. Starting from these words he put this question to his hearers, \"How do we apprehend the Goodness of the Divinity?\"  He challenged one priest after another to treat this subject as if he were standing before his future congregation.  Several disciples rose, and spoke with more or less truth and feeling. At last it came to Anana's turn, who, in well-chosen words, praised the purpose-full beauty of animate and inanimate creation, in which the goodness of Amon       [Amon, that is to say, \"the hidden one.\"  He was the God of Thebes,      which was under his aegis, and after the Hykssos were expelled from      the Nile-valley, he was united with Ra of Heliopolis and endowed      with the attributes of all the remaining Gods.  His nature was more      and more spiritualized, till in the esoteric philosophy of the time      of the Rameses he is compared to the All filling and All guiding      intelligence.  He is \"the husband of his mother, his own father, and      his own son,\" As the living Osiris, he is the soul and spirit of all      creation.]  of Ra,       [Ra, originally the Sun-God; later his name was introduced into the      pantheistic mystic philosophy for that of the God who is the      Universe.]  and Ptah,       [Ptah is the Greek Henhaistas, the oldest of the Gods, the great      maker of the material for the creation, the \"first beginner,\" by      whose side the seven Chnemu stand, as architects, to help him, and      who was named \"the lord of truth,\" because the laws and conditions      of being proceeded from him.  He created also the germ of light, he      stood therefore at the head of the solar Gods, and was called the      creator of ice, from which, when he had cleft it, the sun and the      moan came forth.  Hence his name \"the opener.\"]  as well as of the other Gods, finds expression.  Pentaur listened to the youth with folded arms, now looking at him enquiringly, now adding approbation.  Then taking up the thread of the, discourse when it was ended, he began himself to speak.  Like obedient falcons at the call of the falconer, thoughts rushed down into his mind, and the divine passion awakened in his breast glowed and shone through his inspired language that soared every moment on freer and stronger wings.  Melting into pathos, exulting in rapture, he praised the splendor of nature; and the words flowed from his lips like a limpid crystal-clear stream as he glorified the eternal order of things, and the incomprehensible wisdom and care of the Creator--the One, who is one alone, and great and without equal.  \"So incomparable,\" he said in conclusion, \"is the home which God has given us.  All that He--the One--has created is penetrated with His own essence, and bears witness to His Goodness.  He who knows how to find Him sees Him everywhere, and lives at every instant in the enjoyment of His glory.  Seek Him, and when ye have found Him fall down and sing praises before Him.  But praise the Highest, not only in gratitude for the splendor of that which he has created, but for having given us the capacity for delight in his work.  Ascend the mountain peaks and look on the distant country, worship when the sunset glows with rubies, and the dawn with roses, go out in the nighttime, and look at the stars as they travel in eternal, unerring, immeasurable, and endless circles on silver barks through the blue vault of heaven, stand by the cradle of the child, by the buds of the flowers, and see how the mother bends over the one, and the bright dew-drops fall on the other.  But would you know where the stream of divine goodness is most freely poured out, where the grace of the Creator bestows the richest gifts, and where His holiest altars are prepared?  In your own heart; so long as it is pure and full of love. In such a heart, nature is reflected as in a magic mirror, on whose surface the Beautiful shines in three-fold beauty.  There the eye can reach far away over stream, and meadow, and hill, and take in the whole circle of the earth; there the morning and evening-red shine, not like roses and rubies, but like the very cheeks of the Goddess of Beauty; there the stars circle on, not in silence, but with the mighty voices of the pure eternal harmonies of heaven; there the child smiles like an infant-god, and the bud unfolds to magic flowers; finally, there thankfulness grows broader and devotion grows deeper, and we throw ourselves into the arms of a God, who--as I imagine his glory--is a God to whom the sublime nine great Gods pray as miserable and helpless suppliants.\"  The tomtom which announced the end of the hour interrupted him.  Pentaur ceased speaking with a deep sigh, and for a minute not a scholar moved.  At last the poet laid the papyrus roll out of his hand, wiped the sweat from his hot brow, and walked slowly towards the gate of the court, which led into the sacred grove of the temple.  He had hardly crossed the threshold when he felt a hand laid upon his shoulder.  He looked round.  Behind him stood Ameni.  \"You fascinated your hearers, my friend,\" said the high-priest, coldly; \"it "]]]
