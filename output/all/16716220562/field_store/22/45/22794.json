The only thing that he still desired was to drain the cup of pleasure in her society till all was over.  She sees this, grieves over it, and leaves no means of rousing him to fresh energy untried; yet how rarely he rallies his powers to earnest labour!  \"While she is fortifying the mouths of the Nile and the frontiers of the country, building ship after ship, arming and negotiating, she can not resist him when he summons her to new pleasures.  \"Though so many of the traits which rendered him great and noble have vanished, she can not give up the old love and clings steadfastly to him because, because--I know not why.  A woman's loving heart does not question motives and laws.  Besides, he is the father of her children and, in playing with them, he regains the old joyousness of mood so enthralling to the heart.  \"Since Archibius has taken charge of them, they can dispense with Euphronion, their tutor.  The clever man knows Rome, Octavianus, and those who surround him, so he was chosen as an envoy.  His object was to induce the conqueror to transfer the sovereignty of Egypt to the boys Antonius Helios, and Alexander, but Caesar vouchsafed no answer to the mediator in Antony's affairs--nay, did not even grant him an audience.  \"To Cleopatra Octavianus promised friendly treatment, and the fulfilment of her wish concerning the boys if--and now came the repetition of the old demand--she would put Antony out of the world or deliver him into his hands.  \"This demand, which contains base treachery, was impossible for her noble soul.  Since she had resolved to build the tomb, granting it became impossible, yet Octavianus made every effort to tempt her to the base deed.  True, the death of this one man would have spared much bloodshed. The Caesar knows how to choose his tools.  He sent here as negotiator a clever young man, who possessed great charms of mind and person.  No plan to prejudice the Queen against her husband and persuade her to commit the treachery was left untried.  He went so far as to assure Cleopatra that in former years she had won the Caesar's heart, and that he still loved her.  She accepted these assurances at their true value and remained steadfast.  \"Antony at first paid no heed to the intriguer.  But when he learned what means he employed, and especially how he made use of the surrender of one of Caesar's murderers, which he himself had long regretted, to brand him as an ungrateful traitor, he would not have been Mark Antony if he had accepted it quietly.  He was completely his old self when he ordered the smooth fellow--who, however, had come as the ambassador of the mighty victor--to be scourged, sent him back to Rome, and wrote a letter to Octavianus, in which he complained of the man's arrogance and presumption, adding--spite of my heavy heart I can not help smiling when I think of it--that misfortune had rendered him unusually irritable; yet if his action perhaps displeased Caesar, he might treat his freedman Hipparchus, who was in his power, as he had served Thyrsus!  \"You see that his gay arrogance has not deserted him.  Trouble slips away from him as rain is shaken from the coarse military cloak which he wore in the Parthian war, and therefore it cannot exert its purifying power.  \"When we consider that, a few years ago, this man, as it were, doubled himself when peril was most threatening, his conduct now, on the eve of the decisive struggle, is intelligible only to those who know him as we do.  If he fights, he will no longer do so to save himself, or even to conquer, but to die an honourable death.  If he still enjoys the pleasures offered, he believes that he can thus mitigate for himself the burden of defeat, and diminish the grandeur of the conqueror's victory. In the eyes of the world, at least, a man who can still revel like Antony is only half vanquished.  Yet the lofty tone of his mind was lowered. The surrender of the murderer of Caesar--his name was Turullius--proves it.  \"And this, Barine--tell your husband so--this is what fills me with anxiety and compels me to entreat you not to think of returning home yet.  \"Antony is now the jovial companion of his son, and permits Antyllus to share all his own pleasures.  Of course, he heard of Caesarion's passion, and is disposed to help the poor fellow.  He has often said that nothing would better serve to rouse the dreamer from torpor than your charming vivacity.  As the earth could scarcely have swallowed you up, you would be found; he, too, should be glad to hear you sing again.  I know that search will be made for you.  \"How imperiously this state of affairs requires you to exercise caution needs no explanation.  On the other hand, you may find comfort in the tidings that Cleopatra intends to send Caesarion with his tutor Rhodon to Ethiopia, by way of the island of Philae.  Archibius heard through Timagenes that Octavianus considers the son of Caesar, whose face so wonderfully resembles his father's, a dangerous person, and this opinion is the boy's death-warrant.  Antyllus, too, is going on a journey.  His destination is Asia, where he is to seek to propitiate Octavianus and make him new offers.  As you know, he was betrothed to his daughter Julia.  The Queen ceased long ago to believe in the possibility of victory, yet, spite of all the demands of the \"Comrades of Death\" and her own cares, she toils unweariedly in preparing for the defence of the country.  She is doubtless the only member of that society who thinks seriously of the approaching end.  \"Now that the tomb is rising, she ponders constantly upon death.  She, who was taught by Epicurus to strive for freedom from pain and is so sensitive to the slightest bodily suffering, is still seeking a path which, with the least agony, will lead to the eternal rest for which she longs.  Iras and the younger pupils of Olympus are aiding her.  The old man furnishes all sorts of poisons, which she tries upon various animals --nay, recently even on criminals sentenced to death.  All these experiments seem to prove that the bite of the uraeus serpent, whose image on the Egyptian crown symbolizes the sovereign's instant power over life and death, stills the heart most swiftly and with the least suffering.  \"How terrible these things are!  What pain it causes to see the being one loves most, the mother of the fairest children, so cruelly heighten the anguish of parting, choose death, as it were, for a constant companion, amid the whirl of the gayest amusements!  She daily looks all his terrors in the face, yet with proud contempt turns her back upon the bridge which might perhaps enable her for a time to escape the monster.  This is grand, worthy of her, and never have I loved her more tenderly.  \"You, too, must think of her kindly.  She deserves it.  A noble heart which sees itself forced to pity a foe, easily forgives; and was she ever your enemy?  \"I have written a long, long letter to solace your seclusion from the world and relieve my own heart.  Have patience a little while longer. The time is not far distant when Fate itself will release you from exile. How often your relatives, Archibius and Gorgias, whom I now see frequently in the presence of the Queen, long to visit you!--but they, too, believe that it might prove a source of danger.\"  The warnings in this letter were confirmed by another from Archibius, and soon after they heard that Caesarion had really sailed up the Nile for Ethiopia with his tutor Rhodon, and Antyllus had been sent to Asia to visit Octavianus.  The latter had received him, it is true; but sent him home without making any pledges.  These tidings were not brought by letter, but by Gorgias himself, whose visit surprised them one evening late in March.  Rarely had a guest received a more joyous welcome.  When he entered the bare room, Barine was making a net and telling the fisherman's daughter Dione the story of the wanderings of Ulysses.  Dion, too, listened attentively, now and then correcting or explaining her descriptions, while carving a head of Poseidon for the prow of a newly built boat.  As Gorgias unexpectedly crossed the threshold, the dim light of the lamp fed by kiki-oil seemed transformed into sunshine.  How brightly their eyes sparkled, how joyous were their exclamations of welcome and surprise!  Then came questions, answers, news!  Gorgias was obliged to share the family supper, which had only waited the return of the father who had brought the guest.  The fresh oysters, langustae, and other dishes served tasted more delicious to the denizen of the city than the most delicious banquets of the \"Comrades of Death\" to which he was now frequently invited by the Queen.  All that Pyrrhus said voluntarily and told his sons in reply to their questions was so sensible and related to matters which, because they were new to Gorgias, seemed so fascinating that, when Dion's good wine was served, he declared that if Pyrrhus would receive him he, too, would search for pursuers and be banished here.  When the three again sat alone before the plain clay mixing vessel it seemed to the lonely young couple as if the best part of the city life which they had left behind had found its way to them, and what did they not have to say to one another!  Dion and Barine talked of their hermit life, Gorgias of the Queen and the tomb, which was at the same time a treasure chamber.  The slanting walls were built as firmly as if they were intended to last for centuries and defy a violent assault.  The centre of the lower story was formed by a lofty hall of vast dimensions, in whose midst were the large marble sarcophagi.  Men were working busily upon the figures in relief intended for the decoration of the sides and lids.  This hall, whose low"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5480"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 08 (#5)"],["body"," ceiling was supported by three pairs of heavy columns, was furnished like a reception-room.  The couches, candelabra, and altars were already being made.  Charmian had kept the fugitives well informed.  In the subterranean chambers at the side of the hall, and in the second story, which could not be commenced until the ceiling was completed, store-rooms were to be made, and below and beside them were passages for ventilation and the storage of combustible materials.  Gorgias regretted that he could not show his friend the hall, which was perhaps the handsomest and most costly he had ever created.  The noblest material-brown porphyry, emerald-green serpentine, and the dark varieties of marble-had been used, and the mosaic and brass doors, which were nearing completion, were masterpieces of Alexandrian art.  To have all this destroyed was a terrible thought, but even more unbearable was that of its object--to receive the body of the Queen.  Again rapturous admiration of this greatest and noblest of women led Gorgias to enthusiastic rhapsodies, until Dion exercised his office of soberer, and Barine asked tidings of her mother, her grandparents, and her sister.  There was nothing but good news to be told.  True, the architect had to wage a daily battle with the old philosopher, who termed it an abuse of hospitality to remain so long at his friend's with his whole family; but thus far Gorgias had won the victory, even against Berenike, who wished to take her father and his household to her own home.  Cleopatra had purchased the house and garden of Didymus at thrice their value, the architect added.  He was now a wealthy man, and had commissioned him to build a new mansion.  The land facing the sea and near the museum had been found, but the handsome residence would not be completed until summer.  The dry Egyptian air would have permitted him to roof it sooner, but there were many of Helena's wishes--most of them very sensible ones--to be executed.  Barine and Dion glanced significantly at each other; but the architect, perceiving it, exclaimed: \"Your mute language is intelligible enough, and I confess that for five months Helena has seemed to me the most attractive of maidens.  I see, too, that she has some regard for me. But as soon as I stand before her--the Queen, I mean--and hear her voice, it seems as if a tempest swept away every thought of Helena, and it is not in my nature to deceive any one.  How can I woo a girl whom I so deeply honour--your sister, Barine--when the image of another rules my soul?\"  Dion reminded him of his own words that the Queen was loved only as a goddess and, without waiting for his reply, turned the conversation to other topics.  It was three hours after midnight when Pyrrhus warned Gorgias that it was time for departure.  When the fisherman's fleetest boat was at last bearing him back to the city he wondered whether girls who, before marriage, lived like Helena in undisturbed seclusion, would really be better wives and more content with every lot than the much-courted Barine, whom Dion had led from the gayest whirl of life in the capital to the most desolate solitude.  This delightful evening was followed by a day of excitement and grave anxiety.  It had been necessary to conceal the young couple from the collector's officials, who took from Pyrrhus part of his last year's savings, and the large new boat which he used to go out on the open sea. The preparations for war required large sums; all vessels suitable for the purpose were seized for the fleet, and all residents of the city and country shared the same fate as Pyrrhus.  Even the temple treasures were confiscated, and yet no one could help saying to himself that the vast sums which, through these pitiless extortions, flowed into the treasury, were used for the pleasures of the court as well as for the equipment of the fleet and the army.  Yet so great was the people's love for the Queen, so high their regard for the independence of Egypt, so bitter their hate of Rome, that there was no rebellion.  How earnestly Cleopatra, amid all the extravagant revels, from which she could not too frequently absent herself, toiled to advance the military preparations, could be seen even by the exiles from their cliff; for work in two dock-yards was continued day and night, and the harbour was filled with vessels.  Ships of war were continually moving to and fro, and from the Serpent Island they witnessed constantly, often by starlight, the drilling of the oarsmen and of whole squadrons upon the open sea. Sometimes a magnificent state galley appeared, on whose deck was Antony, who inspected the hastily equipped fleet to make the newly recruited sailors one of those kindling speeches in which he was a master hard to surpass.  Two sons of Pyrrhus were now numbered in the crews of the recently built war ships.  They had been impressed into the service in April, and though Dion had placed a large sum at their father's disposal to secure their release, the attempt was unsuccessful.  So there had been sorrow and tears in the contented little colony of human beings on the lonely cliff, and when Dionysus and Dionichos had a day's leave of absence to visit their relatives, they complained of the cruel haste with which the young men were drilled and wearied to exhaustion, and spoke of the sons of citizens and peasants who had been dragged from their villages, their parents, and their business to be trained for seamen.  There was great indignation among them, and they listened only too readily to the agitators who whispered how much better they would have fared on the galleys of Octavianus.  Pyrrhus entreated his sons not to join any attempt at mutiny; the women, on the contrary, would have approved anything which promised to release the youths from their severe service, and their bright cheerfulness was transformed into anxious depression.  Barine, too, was no longer the same.  She had lost her joyous activity, her eyes were often wet with tears, and she moved with drooping head as if some heavy care oppressed her.  Was it the heat of April, with its desert winds, which had brought the transformation?  Had longing for the changeful, exciting life of former days at last overpowered her?  Was solitude becoming unendurable?  Was her husband's love no longer sufficient to replace the many pleasures she had sacrificed?--No!  It could not be that; never had she gazed with more devoted tenderness into Dion's face than when entirely alone with him in shady nooks.  She who in such hours looked the very embodiment of happiness and contentment, certainly was neither ill nor sorrowful.  Dion, on the contrary, held his head high early and late, and appeared as proud and self-conscious as though life was showing him its fairest face. Yet he had heard that his estates had been sequestrated, and that he owed it solely to the influence of Archibius and his uncle, that his property, like that of so many others, had not been added to the royal treasures. But what disaster could he not have speedily vanquished in these days?  A great joy--the greatest which the immortals can bestow upon human beings--was dawning for him and his young wife, and in May the women on the island shared her blissful hope.  Pyrrhus brought from the city an altar and a marble statue of Ilythyia, the Goddess of Birth, called by the Romans Lucina, which his friend Anukis had given him, in Charmian's name, for the young wife.  She had again spoken of the serpents which lived in such numbers in the neighbouring islands, and her question whether it would be difficult to capture one alive was answered by the freedman in the negative.  The image of the goddess and the altar were erected beside the other sanctuaries, and how often the stone was anointed by Barine and the women of the fisherman's family!  Dion vowed to the goddess a beautiful temple on the cliff and in the city if she would be gracious to his beloved young wife.  When, in June, the noonday sun blazed most fiercely, the fisherman brought to the cliff Helena, Barine's sister, and Chloris, Dion's nurse, who had been a faithful assistant of his mother, and afterwards managed the female slaves of the household.  How joyously and gratefully Barine held out her arms to her sister!  Her mother had been prevented from coming only by the warning that her disappearance would surely attract the attention of the spies.  And the latter were very alert; for Mark Antony had not yet given up the pursuit of the singer, nor had the attorney Philostratus recalled the proclamation offering two talents for the capture of Dion, and both the latter's palace and Berenike's house were constantly watched.  It seemed more difficult for the quiet Helena to accommodate herself to this solitude than for her gayer-natured sister.  Plainly as she showed her love for Barine, she often lapsed into reverie, and every evening she went to the southern side of the cliff and gazed towards the city, where her grandparents doubtless sorely missed her, spite of the careful attention bestowed upon them in Gorgias's house.  Eight days had passed since her arrival, and life in this wilderness seemed more distasteful than on the first and the second; the longing for her grandparents, too, appeared to increase; for that day she had gone to the shore, even under the burning rays of the noonday sun, to gaze towards the city.  How dearly she loved the old people!  But Dion's conjecture that the tears sparkling in Helena's eyes when she entered their room at dusk were connected with another resident of the capital, spite of his wife's indignant denial, appeared to be correct; for, a short time after, clear voices were heard in front of the-house, and when a deep, hearty laugh rang out, Dion started up, exclaiming, \"Gorgias never laughs in that way, except when he has had some unusual piece of good fortune!\"  He hurried out as he spoke, and gazed around; but, notwithstanding the bright"]]]
