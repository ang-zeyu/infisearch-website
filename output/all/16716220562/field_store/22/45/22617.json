This is the first time I could ever really claim that. In other cases I may have helped; but, Anne, if I had not stayed at Allonby's last night and fought death hand to hand, that woman would have died before morning.  I tried an experiment that was certainly never tried in Four Winds before.  I doubt if it was ever tried anywhere before outside of a hospital.  It was a new thing in Kingsport hospital last winter.  I could never have dared try it here if I had not been absolutely certain that there was no other chance.  I risked it--and it succeeded.  As a result, a good wife and mother is saved for long years of happiness and usefulness.  As I drove home this morning, while the sun was rising over the harbor, I thanked God that I had chosen the profession I did.  I had fought a good fight and won--think of it, Anne, WON, against the Great Destroyer.  It's what I dreamed of doing long ago when we talked together of what we wanted to do in life. That dream of mine came true this morning.\"  \"Was that the only one of your dreams that has come true?\" asked Anne, who knew perfectly well what the substance of his answer would be, but wanted to hear it again.  \"YOU know, Anne-girl,\" said Gilbert, smiling into her eyes.  At that moment there were certainly two perfectly happy people sitting on the doorstep of a little white house on the Four Winds Harbor shore.  Presently Gilbert said, with a change of tone, \"Do I or do I not see a full-rigged ship sailing up our lane?\"  Anne looked and sprang up.  \"That must be either Miss Cornelia Bryant or Mrs. Moore coming to call,\" she said.  \"I'm going into the office, and if it is Miss Cornelia I warn you that I'll eavesdrop,\" said Gilbert.  \"From all I've heard regarding Miss Cornelia I conclude that her conversation will not be dull, to say the least.\"  \"It may be Mrs. Moore.\"  \"I don't think Mrs. Moore is built on those lines.  I saw her working in her garden the other day, and, though I was too far away to see clearly, I thought she was rather slender.  She doesn't seem very socially inclined when she has never called on you yet, although she's your nearest neighbor.\"  \"She can't be like Mrs. Lynde, after all, or curiosity would have brought her,\" said Anne.  \"This caller is, I think, Miss Cornelia.\"  Miss Cornelia it was; moreover, Miss Cornelia had not come to make any brief and fashionable wedding call.  She had her work under her arm in a substantial parcel, and when Anne asked her to stay she promptly took off her capacious sun-hat, which had been held on her head, despite irreverent September breezes, by a tight elastic band under her hard little knob of fair hair.  No hat pins for Miss Cornelia, an it please ye!  Elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and they were good enough for HER.  She had a fresh, round, pink-and-white face, and jolly brown eyes.  She did not look in the least like the traditional old maid, and there was something in her expression which won Anne instantly.  With her old instinctive quickness to discern kindred spirits she knew she was going to like Miss Cornelia, in spite of uncertain oddities of opinion, and certain oddities of attire.  Nobody but Miss Cornelia would have come to make a call arrayed in a striped blue-and-white apron and a wrapper of chocolate print, with a design of huge, pink roses scattered over it.  And nobody but Miss Cornelia could have looked dignified and suitably garbed in it.  Had Miss Cornelia been entering a palace to call on a prince's bride, she would have been just as dignified and just as wholly mistress of the situation.  She would have trailed her rose-spattered flounce over the marble floors just as unconcernedly, and she would have proceeded just as calmly to disabuse the mind of the princess of any idea that the possession of a mere man, be he prince or peasant, was anything to brag of.  \"I've brought my work, Mrs. Blythe, dearie,\" she remarked, unrolling some dainty material.  \"I'm in a hurry to get this done, and there isn't any time to lose.\"  Anne looked in some surprise at the white garment spread over Miss Cornelia's ample lap.  It was certainly a baby's dress, and it was most beautifully made, with tiny frills and tucks.  Miss Cornelia adjusted her glasses and fell to embroidering with exquisite stitches.  \"This is for Mrs. Fred Proctor up at the Glen,\" she announced.  \"She's expecting her eighth baby any day now, and not a stitch has she ready for it.  The other seven have wore out all she made for the first, and she's never had time or strength or spirit to make any more.  That woman is a martyr, Mrs. Blythe, believe ME.  When she married Fred Proctor _I_ knew how it would turn out.  He was one of your wicked, fascinating men.  After he got married he left off being fascinating and just kept on being wicked.  He drinks and he neglects his family. Isn't that like a man?  I don't know how Mrs. Proctor would ever keep her children decently clothed if her neighbors didn't help her out.\"  As Anne was afterwards to learn, Miss Cornelia was the only neighbor who troubled herself much about the decency of the young Proctors.  \"When I heard this eighth baby was coming I decided to make some things for it,\" Miss Cornelia went on.  \"This is the last and I want to finish it today.\"  \"It's certainly very pretty,\" said Anne.  \"I'll get my sewing and we'll have a little thimble party of two.  You are a beautiful sewer, Miss Bryant.\"  \"Yes, I'm the best sewer in these parts,\" said Miss Cornelia in a matter-of-fact tone.  \"I ought to be!  Lord, I've done more of it than if I'd had a hundred children of my own, believe ME!  I s'pose I'm a fool, to be putting hand embroidery on this dress for an eighth baby. But, Lord, Mrs. Blythe, dearie, it isn't to blame for being the eighth, and I kind of wished it to have one real pretty dress, just as if it WAS wanted.  Nobody's wanting the poor mite--so I put some extra fuss on its little things just on that account.\"  \"Any baby might be proud of that dress,\" said Anne, feeling still more strongly that she was going to like Miss Cornelia.  \"I s'pose you've been thinking I was never coming to call on you,\" resumed Miss Cornelia.  \"But this is harvest month, you know, and I've been busy--and a lot of extra hands hanging round, eating more'n they work, just like the men.  I'd have come yesterday, but I went to Mrs. Roderick MacAllister's funeral.  At first I thought my head was aching so badly I couldn't enjoy myself if I did go.  But she was a hundred years old, and I'd always promised myself that I'd go to her funeral.\"  \"Was it a successful function?\" asked Anne, noticing that the office door was ajar.  \"What's that?  Oh, yes, it was a tremendous funeral.  She had a very large connection.  There was over one hundred and twenty carriages in the procession.  There was one or two funny things happened.  I thought that die I would to see old Joe Bradshaw, who is an infidel and never darkens the door of a church, singing 'Safe in the Arms of Jesus' with great gusto and fervor.  He glories in singing--that's why he never misses a funeral.  Poor Mrs. Bradshaw didn't look much like singing--all wore out slaving.  Old Joe starts out once in a while to buy her a present and brings home some new kind of farm machinery. Isn't that like a man?  But what else would you expect of a man who never goes to church, even a Methodist one?  I was real thankful to see you and the young Doctor in the Presbyterian church your first Sunday. No doctor for me who isn't a Presbyterian.\"  \"We were in the Methodist church last Sunday evening,\" said Anne wickedly.  \"Oh, I s'pose Dr. Blythe has to go to the Methodist church once in a while or he wouldn't get the Methodist practice.\"  \"We liked the sermon very much,\" declared Anne boldly.  \"And I thought the Methodist minster's prayer was one of the most beautiful I ever heard.\"  \"Oh, I've no doubt he can pray.  I never heard anyone make more beautiful prayers than old Simon Bentley, who was always drunk, or hoping to be, and the drunker he was the better he prayed.\"  \"The Methodist minister is very fine looking,\" said Anne, for the benefit of the office door.  \"Yes, he's quite ornamental,\" agreed Miss Cornelia.  \"Oh, and VERY ladylike.  And he thinks that every girl who looks at him falls in love with him--as if a Methodist minister, wandering about like any Jew, was such a prize!  If you and the young doctor take MY advice, you won't have much to do with the Methodists.  My motto is--if you ARE a Presbyterian, BE a Presbyterian.\"  \"Don't you think that Methodists go to heaven as well as Presbyterians?\" asked Anne smilelessly.  \"That isn't for US to decide.  It's in higher hands than ours,\" said Miss Cornelia solemnly.  \"But I ain't going to associate with them on earth whatever I may have to do in heaven.  THIS Methodist minister isn't married.  The last one they had was, and his wife was the silliest, flightiest little thing I ever saw.  I told her husband once that he should have waited till she was grown up before he married her. He said he wanted to have the training of her.  Wasn't that like a man?\"  \"It's rather hard to decide just when people ARE grown up,\" laughed Anne.  \"That's a true word, dearie.  Some are grown up when they're born, and others ain't grown up when they're eighty, believe ME. That same Mrs. Roderick I was speaking of never grew up.  She was as foolish when she was a hundred as when she was ten.\"  \"Perhaps that was why she lived so long,\" suggested Anne.  \"Maybe 'twas.  _I_'d rather live fifty sensible years than a hundred foolish ones.\"  \"But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 02 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      UARDA  Volume 2.  By Georg Ebers    CHAPTER V.  The night during which the Princess Bent-Anat and her followers had knocked at the gate of the House of Seti was past.  The fruitful freshness of the dawn gave way to the heat, which began to pour down from the deep blue cloudless vault of heaven.  The eye could no longer gaze at the mighty globe of light whose rays pierced the fine white dust which hung over the declivity of the hills that enclosed the city of the dead on the west.  The limestone rocks showed with blinding clearness, the atmosphere quivered as if heated over a flame; each minute the shadows grew shorter and their outlines sharper.  All the beasts which we saw peopling the Necropolis in the evening had now withdrawn into their lurking places; only man defied the heat of the summer day.  Undisturbed he accomplished his daily work, and only laid his tools aside for a moment, with a sigh, when a cooling breath blew across the overflowing stream and fanned his brow.  The harbor or clock where those landed who crossed from eastern Thebes was crowded with barks and boats waiting to return.  The crews of rowers and steersmen who were attached to priestly brotherhoods or noble houses, were enjoying a rest till the parties they had brought across the Nile drew towards them again in long processions.  Under a wide-spreading sycamore a vendor of eatables, spirituous drinks, and acids for cooling the water, had set up his stall, and close to him, a crowd of boatmen, and drivers shouted and disputed as they passed the time in eager games at morra.       [In Latin \"micare digitis.\"  A game still constantly played in the      south of Europe, and frequently represented by the Egyptians.  The      games depicted in the monuments are collected by Minutoli, in the      Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung, 1852.]  Many sailors lay on the decks of the vessels, others on the shore; here in the thin shade of a palm tree, there in the full blaze of the sun, from those burning rays they protected themselves by spreading the cotton cloths, which served them for cloaks, over their faces.  Between the sleepers passed bondmen and slaves, brown and black, in long files one behind the other, bending under the weight of heavy burdens, which had to be conveyed to their destination at the temples for sacrifice, or to the dealers in various wares.  Builders dragged blocks of stone, which had come from the quarries of Chennu and Suan,       [The Syene of the Greeks, non, called Assouan at the first      cataract.]  on sledges to the site of a new temple; laborers poured water under the runners, that the heavily loaded and dried wood should not take fire.  All these working men were driven with sticks by their overseers, and sang at their labor; but the voices of the leaders sounded muffled and hoarse, though, when after their frugal meal they enjoyed an hour of repose, they might be heard loud enough.  Their parched throats refused to sing in the noontide of their labor.  Thick clouds of gnats followed these tormented gangs, who with dull and spirit-broken endurance suffered alike the stings of the insects and the blows of their driver.  The gnats pursued them to the very heart of the City of the dead, where they joined themselves to the flies and wasps, which swarmed in countless crowds around the slaughter houses, cooks' shops, stalls of fried fish, and booths of meat, vegetable, honey, cakes and drinks, which were doing a brisk business in spite of the noontide heat and the oppressive atmosphere heated and filled with a mixture of odors.  The nearer one got to the Libyan frontier, the quieter it became, and the silence of death reigned in the broad north-west valley, where in the southern slope the father of the reigning king had caused his tomb to be hewn, and where the stone-mason of the Pharaoh had prepared a rock tomb for him.  A newly made road led into this rocky gorge, whose steep yellow and brown walls seemed scorched by the sun in many blackened spots, and looked like a ghostly array of shades that had risen from the tombs in the night and remained there.  At the entrance of this valley some blocks of stone formed a sort of doorway, and through this, indifferent to the heat of day, a small but brilliant troop of the men was passing.  Four slender youths as staff bearers led the procession, each clothed only with an apron and a flowing head-cloth of gold brocade; the mid-day sun played on their smooth, moist, red-brown skins, and their supple naked feet hardly stirred the stones on the road.  Behind them followed an elegant, two-wheeled chariot, with two prancing brown horses bearing tufts of red and blue feathers on their noble heads, and seeming by the bearing of their arched necks and flowing tails to express their pride in the gorgeous housings, richly embroidered in silver, purple, and blue and golden ornaments, which they wore--and even more in their beautiful, royal charioteer, Bent-Anat, the daughter of Rameses, at whose lightest word they pricked their ears, and whose little hand guided them with a scarcely perceptible touch.  Two young men dressed like the other runners followed the chariot, and kept the rays of the sun off the face of their mistress with large fans of snow-white ostrich feathers fastened to long wands.  By the side of Bent-Anat, so long as the road was wide enough to allow of it, was carried Nefert, the wife of Mena, in her gilt litter, borne by eight tawny bearers, who, running with a swift and equally measured step, did not remain far behind the trotting horses of the princess and her fan-bearers.  Both the women, whom we now see for the first time in daylight, were of remarkable but altogether different beauty.  The wife of Mena had preserved the appearance of a maiden; her large almond-shaped eyes had a dreamy surprised look out from under her long eyelashes, and her figure of hardly the middle-height had acquired a little stoutness without losing its youthful grace.  No drop of foreign blood flowed in her veins, as could be seen in the color of her skin, which was of that fresh and equal line which holds a medium between golden yellow and bronze brown--and which to this day is so charming in the maidens of Abyssinia--in her straight nose, her well-formed brow, in her smooth but thick black hair, and in the fineness of her hands and feet, which were ornamented with circles of gold.  The maiden princess next to her had hardly reached her nineteenth year, and yet something of a womanly self-consciousness betrayed itself in her demeanor.  Her stature was by almost a head taller than that of her friend, her skin was fairer, her blue eyes kind and frank, without tricks of glance, but clear and honest, her profile was noble but sharply cut, and resembled that of her father, as a landscape in the mild and softening light of the moon resembles the same landscape in the broad clear light of day.  The scarcely perceptible aquiline of her nose, she inherited from her Semitic ancestors,       [Many portraits have come down to us of Rameses: the finest is the      noble statue preserved at Turin.  A likeness has been detected      between its profile, with its slightly aquiline nose, and that of      Napoleon I.]  as well as the slightly waving abundance of her brown hair, over which she wore a blue and white striped silk kerchief; its carefully-pleated folds were held in place by a gold ring, from which in front a horned urarus       [A venomous Egyptian serpent which was adopted as the symbol of      sovereign power, in consequence of its swift effects for life or      death.  It is never wanting to the diadem of the Pharaohs.]  raised its head crowned with a disk of rubies.  From her left temple a large tress, plaited with gold thread, hung down to her waist, the sign of her royal birth.  She wore a purple dress of fine, almost transparent stuff, that was confined with a gold belt and straps.  Round her throat was fastened a necklace like a collar, made of pearls and costly stones, and hanging low down on her well-formed bosom.  Behind the princess stood her charioteer, an old officer of noble birth.  Three litters followed the chariot of the princess, and in each sat two officers of the court; then came a dozen of slaves ready for any service, and lastly a crowd of wand-bearers to drive off the idle populace, and of lightly-armed soldiers, who--dressed only in the apron and head-cloth-- each bore a dagger-shaped sword in his girdle, an axe in his right hand, and in his left; in token of his peaceful service, a palm-branch.  Like dolphins round a ship, little girls in long shirt-shaped garments swarmed round the whole length of the advancing procession, bearing water-jars on their steady heads, and at a sign from any one who was thirsty were ready to give him a drink.  With steps as light as the gazelle they often outran the horses, and nothing could be more graceful than the action with which the taller ones bent over with the water-jars held in both arms to the drinker.  The courtiers, cooled and shaded by waving fans, and hardly perceiving the noontide heat, conversed at their ease about indifferent matters, and the princess pitied the poor horses, who were tormented as they ran, by annoying gadflies; while the runners and soldiers, the litter-bearers and fan-bearers, the girls with their jars and the panting slaves, were compelled to exert themselves under the rays of the mid-day sun in the service of their masters, till their sinews threatened to crack and their lungs to burst their bodies.  At a spot where the road widened, and where, to the right, lay the steep cross-valley where the last kings of the dethroned race were interred, the procession stopped"]]]
