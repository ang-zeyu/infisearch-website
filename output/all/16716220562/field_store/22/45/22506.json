He was a lieutenant in one of Blair's companies before the call came.\"  The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.  \"Find it pretty hard?\" he asked.  Stephen's expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more vigorously than before.  \"Just you WAIT, Mr. Brice,\" he said. \"It won't hurt you any.\"  Stephen was grateful. But he hoped to fall out of the talk. Much to his discomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks. His whole manner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain Elijah Brent.  \"Aren't you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile Library Hall?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the Judge. \"He is.\"  At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen's.  \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except some of Abraham Lincoln's. Brinsmade gave it to me to read. Whipple, that speech reminded me of Lincoln. It was his style. Where did you get it, Mr. Brice?\" he demanded.  \"I heard Mr. Lincoln's debate with Judge Douglas at 'Freeport,\" said Stephen; beginning to be amused.  The Major laughed.  \"I admire your frankness, sir,\" he said. \"I meant to say that its logic rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.\"  \"I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman.\"  At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds. Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last in the blue of their country's service. Old soldiers with baskets of cartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the recruits. Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not enough belts to go around. The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned. It was driven away again by Major Sherman's vivacious comments. For suddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.  \"Look at him!\" cried the Major, \"he's a man after my own heart. Just look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the papers bulging from his pockets. Not dignified, eh, Whipple? But this isn't the time to be dignified. If there were some like Lyon in Washington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time. Don't talk to me of Washington! Just look at him!\"  The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major Sherman's picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment, and from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing, gesticulating, commanding. In him Stephen recognized the force that had swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the tape with which they had tied him.  Would he be duped by the Governor's ruse of establishing a State Camp at this time? Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not. This man could see to the bottom, through every specious argument. Little matters of law and precedence did not trouble him. Nor did he believe elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops were there for peace.  After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to Captain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of the Volunteer regiments. Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march.  \"To Camp Jackson?\" asked Stephen.  Richter shrugged his shoulders.  \"We are not consulted, my friend,\" he said. \"Will you come into my quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?\"  Stephen went. It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship was gone. To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were asunder, and he was become an outcast.     CHAPTER XVIII  THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED  That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something was to happen. For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday's incidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed.  \"I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day,\" he said to his mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room.  Mrs. Brice dropped her knitting in her lap.  \"Why, Stephen?\"  \"I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them finishing the equipment of the new regiments. Something was in the wind. Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about. I think he must have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from the South.\"  Mrs. Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the apprehension she felt.  \"Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?\" she asked.  \"I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops. I meant to tell you about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used to be in the army. Mr. Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many other prominent men here. He came to St. Louis some months ago to take the position of president of the Fifth Street Line. He is the keenest, the most original man I have ever met. As long as I live I shall never forget his description of Lyon.\"  \"Is the Major going back into the army?\" said Mrs. Brice, Stephen did not remark the little falter in her voice. He laughed over the recollection of the conversation in the street car.  \"Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him,\" he said. \"He thinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple to say so anywhere. I could not have believed it possible that two men could have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and not be shot down. I thought that it was as much as a man's life is worth to mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd. And the way Mr. Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to make your hair stand on end.\"  \"He must be a bold man,\" murmured Mrs. Brice.  \"Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?\"  \"Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number.\"  Mrs. Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.  \"I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen,\" she said.  He was silent. From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed very far away. The morning sun poured in through the south windows and was scattered by the silver on the sideboard. From above, on the wall, Colonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down. Stephen's eyes lighted on the portrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to ply his father with questions about it. Then the picture had suggested only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history. Something worthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high. The hatred and the suffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of loving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas, Will war ever be painted with a wart?  The sound of feet was heard on the pavement. Stephen rose, glancing at his mother. Her face was still upon her knitting.  \"I am going to the Arsenal,\" he said. \"I must see what as happening.\"  To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women. She did not try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by. But when the door had shut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.  His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag, ominously quiet at that early hour. At sight of it anger made him hot again. The car for South St. Louis stood at the end of the line, fast filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of the equipment of the new troops. There was little talk among them, and that little guarded.  It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into life at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory of their first green. Stephen found the shaded street in front of the Arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd. Sharp commands broke the silence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the wall. Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no part.  As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices close beside him. Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr. Cluyme. It was Mr. Cluyme who was speaking.  \"Well, Mr. Hopper,\" he said, \"in spite of what you say, I expect you are dust as eager as I am to see what is going on. You've taken an early start this morning for sightseeing.\"  Eliphalet's equanimity was far from shaken.  \"I don't cal'late to take a great deal of stock in the military,\" he answered. \"But business is business. And a man must keep an eye on what is moving.\"  Mr. Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his voice.  \"You're right, Hopper,\" he assented. \"And if this city is going to be Union, we ought to know it right away.\"  Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of a man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward before Mr. Hopper. He presented a somewhat uncompromising front. Mr. Cluyme instantly melted away.  \"My friend,\" said the stranger, quietly, \"I think we have met before, when your actions were not greatly to your credit. I do not forget a face, even when I see it in the dark. Now I hear you utter words which are a disgrace to a citizen of the United States. I have some respect for a rebel. I have none for you, sir.\"  As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that Eliphalet had changed countenance. The manner of an important man of affairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him. He took a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift. Stephen rejoiced to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company before that dignitary had time to depart, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5392"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 05 (#4)"],["body"," unconcernedly there as if nothing had occurred.  Then Stephen stared at him.  He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a great El Sol cigar. He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots. His trousers were creased at the knees. His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively. He had a light brown beard that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.  This was all that Stephen saw. And yet the very plainness of the man's appearance only added to his curiosity. Who was this stranger? His words, his action, too, had been remarkable. The art of administering a rebuke like that was not given to many men. It was perfectly quiet, perfectly final. And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and dismissed it.  Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper. Stephen had suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain, and hence the conversation with Mr. Cluyme had given him no shock in the way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel Carvel to hear it? Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the cigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple? The sudden rattle of drums gave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and hatred fast widening between the friends.  All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand against the tree-box. A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate, the Union leader in his colonel's uniform, on horseback at its head. He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle, chatting with other officers around him.  Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up to the Colonel's horse, He was still smoking. This move, too, was surprising enough, It argued even more assurance. Stephen listened intently.  \"Colonel Blair, my name is Grant,\" he said briefly.  The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially, \"Captain Ulysses Grant,\" said he; \"of the old army?\"  Mr. Grant nodded.  \"I wanted to wish you luck,\" he said.  \"Thank you, Grant,\" answered the Colonel. \"But you? Where are you living now?\"  \"I moved to Illinois after I left here,\" replied Mr. Grant, as quietly as before, \"and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there. I went down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to be of any help I could. They made me a clerk in the adjutant general's office of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while.\" He paused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into the Colonel's comprehension. \"Then they found out that I'd been quartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders Now I'm a state mustering officer. I came down to Belleville to muster in a regiment, which wasn't ready. And so I ran over here to see what you fellows were doing.\"  If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone, it is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter. But Mr. Grant possessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however; that Colonel Blair had other things to think of. Nevertheless he said kindly:  \"Aren't you going in, Grant?\"  \"I can't afford to go in as a captain of volunteers,\" was the calm reply: \"I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can command a regiment.\"  The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not reply. Mr. Grant moved off up the street. Some of the younger officers who were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.  \"Command a regiment!\" cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized as having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington's, and whose stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly. \"I guess I'm about as fit to command a regiment as Grant is.\"  \"That man's forty years old, if he's a day,\" put in another. \"I remember when he came here to St. Louis in '54, played out. He'd resigned from the army on the Pacific Coast. He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois Road, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until last year. You remember him, Joe.\"  \"Yep,\" said Joe. \"I spotted him by the El Sol cigar. He used to bring a load of wood to the city once in a while, and then he'd go over to the Planters' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows, and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian. After that he came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one winter. But he didn't make it go. Curious, it is just a year ago this month than he went over to Illinois. He's an honest fellow, and hard working enough, but he don't know how. He's just a dead failure.\"  \"Command a regiment!\" laughed the first, again, as of this in particular had struck his sense of humor. \"I guess he won't get a regiment in a hurry, There's lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for good jobs now.\"  \"He might fool you fellows yet,\" said the one caller, though his tone was not one of conviction. \"I understand he had a first-rate record an the Mexican War.\"  Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which put an end to this desultory talk. As the First Regiment took up the march, the words \"Camp Jackson\" ran from mouth to mouth on the sidewalks. Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on passing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming hosts beating in his ears.  In the city, shutters were going up on the stores. The streets were filled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here and there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the negro drivers betraying their excitement. While Stephen related to his mother the events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner. It lay; still untouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the front steps. Sigel's regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its wake a seething crowd.  Three persons came out of the big house next door. One was Anna Brinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered. The third was Jack. His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he struggling in her grasp. Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of a pepperbox revolver.  \"Let me go, Anne!\" he cried. \"Do you think I can stay here while my people are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?\"  \"John,\" said Mr. Brinsmade, sternly, \"I cannot let you join a mob. I cannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.\"  \"You cannot prevent me, sir,\" shouted the young man, in a frenzy. \"When foreigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them down.\"  Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of the regiment. Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream. After that silence fell upon the street, and Mr. Brinsmade turned and went back into the house, his head bowed as in prayer. Stephen and his mother drew back, but Anne saw them.  \"He is a rebel,\" she faltered. \"It will break my father's heart.\"  She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes. Then she, too went in.  \"I cannot stay here mother,\" he said.  As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name. He paused, and she caught his sleeve.  \"I knew you would go,\" she said, \"I knew you would go. Oh, Stephen, you have a cool head. Try to keep Jack--out of mischief.\"  He left her standing on the pavement. But when he reached the corner and looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to meet his mother. Then he walked rapidly westward. Now and again he was stopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the second ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now runs. There stood the new double mansion Mr. Spencer Catherwood had built two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at the side, and the brick stable and stable yard. As Stephen approached it, the thought came to him how little this world's goods avail in times of trouble. One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching regiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken his doors. Another was in Clarence Colfax's company of dragoons, and still another had fled southward the night after Sumter.  Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the new-turned street, to gaze westward. Clouds were gathering in the sky, but the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines had crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the glint of the sun on rifle barrels. Directed by a genius in the art of war, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.  As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who hurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano. They came through the wide-shuttered window above his head. Then a girl's voice rose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--         \"Away down South in de fields of cotton,         Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,         Look away, look away, Look away, look away.         Den I wish I was in Dixie's Land,         Oh, oh! oh, oh!         In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,         And live and die in Dixie's Land.         Away, away, away.         Away down South in Dixie.\"  The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter. Stephen was rooted to the spot.  \"Jinny! Jinny Carvel, how dare you!\" came through the shutters. \"We shall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here.\"  Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods' coachman, came out of the stable yard. The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror. Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:  \"Mistah Brice, if de"]]]
