She could often distinguish the shrill voice of Boges joking and laughing with these women, who were under his charge.  At last all was quiet in the wide palace halls and then her thoughts turned to her distant home and her poor sister Tachot, longing for her and for the beautiful Bartja, who, Croesus had told her, was going to-morrow to the war and possibly to death.  At last she fell asleep, overcome by the fatigue of the journey and dreaming of her future husband.  She saw him on his black charger. The foaming animal shied at Bartja who was lying in the road, threw his rider and dragged him into the Nile, whose waves became blood-red.  In her terror she screamed for help; her cries were echoed back from the Pyramids in such loud and fearful tones that she awoke.  But hark! what could that be?  That wailing, shrill cry which she had heard in her dream,--she could hear it still.  Hastily drawing aside the shutters from one of the openings which served as windows, she looked out.  A large and beautiful garden, laid out with fountains and shady avenues, lay before her, glittering with the early dew.       [The Persian gardens were celebrated throughout the old world, and      seem to have been laid out much less stiffly than the Egyptian.      Even the kings of Persia did not consider horticulture beneath their      notice, and the highest among the Achaemenidae took an especial      pleasure in laying out parks, called in Persian Paradises.  Their      admiration for well-grown trees went so far, that Xerxes, finding on      his way to Greece a singularly beautiful tree, hung ornaments of      gold upon its branches.  Firdusi, the great Persian epic poet,      compares human beauty to the growth of the cypress, as the highest      praise he can give.  Indeed some trees were worshipped by the      Persians; and as the tree of life in the Hebrew and Egyptian, so we      find sacred trees in their Paradise.]  No sound was to be heard except the one which had alarmed her, and this too died away at last on the morning breeze.  After a few minutes she heard cries and noise in the distance, then the great city awaking to its daily work, which soon settled down into a deep, dull murmur like the roaring of the sea.  Nitetis was by this time so thoroughly awakened from the effect of the fresh morning air, that she did not care to lie down again.  She went once more to the window and perceived two figures coming out of the house.  One she recognized as the eunuch Boges; he was talking to a beautiful Persian woman carelessly dressed.  They approached her window. Nitetis hid herself behind the half-opened shutter and listened, for she fancied she heard her own name.  \"The Egyptian is still asleep.\"  said Boges.  \"She must be much fatigued by the journey.  I see too that one of her windows is still firmly closed.\"  \"Then tell me quickly,\" said the Persian.  \"Do you really think that this stranger's coming can injure me in any way?\"  \"Certainly, I do, my pretty one.\"  \"But what leads you to suppose this?\"  \"She is only to obey the king's commands, not mine.\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"No, my treasure.  I know the king.  I can read his features as the Magi read the sacred books.\"  \"Then we must ruin her.\"  \"More easily said than done, my little bird.\"  \"Leave me alone!  you are insolent.\"  \"Well, but nobody can see us, and you know you can do nothing without my help.\"  \"Very well then, I don't care.  But tell me quickly what we can do.\"  \"Thanks, my sweet Phaedime.  Well, for the present we must be patient and wait our time.  That detestable hypocrite Croesus seems to have established himself as protector of the Egyptian; when he is away, we must set our snares.\"  The speakers were by this time at such a distance, that Nitetis could not understand what they said.  In silent indignation she closed the shutter, and called her maidens to dress her.  She knew her enemies now--she knew that a thousand dangers surrounded her, and yet she felt proud and happy, for was she not chosen to be the real wife of Cambyses?  Her own worth seemed clearer to her than ever before, from a comparison with these miserable creatures, and a wonderful certainty of ultimate victory stole into her heart, for Nitetis was a firm believer in the magic power of virtue.  \"What was that dreadful sound I heard so early?\"  she asked of her principal waiting-woman, who was arranging her hair.  \"Do you mean the sounding brass, lady?\"  \"Scarcely two hours ago I was awakened by a strange and frightful sound.\"  \"That was the sounding brass, lady.  It is used to awaken the young sons of the Persian nobles, who are brought up at the gate of the king.  You will soon become accustomed to it.  We have long ceased even to hear it, and indeed on great festivals, when it is not sounded, we awake from the unaccustomed stillness.  From the hanging-gardens you will be able to see how the boys are taken to bathe every morning, whatever the weather may be.  The poor little ones are taken from their mothers when they are six years old, to be brought up with the other boys of their own rank under the king's eye.\"  \"Are they to begin learning the luxurious manners of the court so early?\"  \"Oh no! the poor boys lead a terrible life.  They are obliged to sleep on the hard ground, to rise before the sun.  Their food is bread and water, with very little meat, and they are never allowed to taste wine or vegetables.  Indeed at times they are deprived of food and drink for some days, simply to accustom them to privations.  When the court is at Ecbatana or Pasargadae, and the weather is bitterly cold, they are sure to be taken out to bathe, and here in Susa, the hotter the sun, the longer and more difficult the marches they are compelled to take.\"       [The summer residences of the kings cf Persia, where it is sometimes      very cold.  Ecbatana lies at the foot of the high Elburs (Orontes)      range of mountains in the neighborhood of the modern Hamadan;      Pasargadae not far from Rachmet in the highlands of Iran]  \"And these boys, so simply and severely brought up, become in after life such luxurious men?\"  \"Yes, that is always the case.  A meal that has been waited for is all the more relished when it comes.  These boys see splendor and magnificence around them daily; they know how rich they are in reality, and yet have to suffer from hunger and privation.  Who can wonder, if, when at last they gain their liberty, they plunge into the pleasures of life with a tenfold eagerness?  But on the other hand, in time of war, or when going to the chase, they never murmur at hunger or thirst, spring with a laugh into the mud regardless of their thin boots and purple trousers, and sleep as soundly on a rock as on their beds of delicate Arabian wool.  You must see the feats these boys perform, especially when the king is watching them!  Cambyses will certainly take you if you ask him.\"  \"I know those exercises already.  In Egypt the girls as well as the boys are kept to such gymnastic exercises.  My limbs were trained to flexibility by running, postures, and games with hoops and balls.  \"How strange!  Here, we women grow up just as we please, and are taught nothing but a little spinning and weaving.  Is it true that most of the Egyptian women can read and write?\"  \"Yes, nearly all.\"  \"By Mithras, you must be a clever people!  Scarcely any of the Persians, except the Magi and the scribes, learn these difficult arts.  The sons of the nobles are taught to speak the truth, to be courageous, obedient, and to reverence the gods; to hunt, ride, plant trees and discern between herbs; but whoever, like the noble Darius, wishes to learn the art of writing, must apply to the Magi.  Women are forbidden to turn their minds to such studies.--Now your dress is complete.  This string of pearls, which the king sent this morning, looks magnificent in your raven-black hair, but it is easy to see that you are not accustomed to the full silk trousers and high-heeled boots.  If, however, you walk two or three times up and down the room you will surpass all the Persian ladies even in your walk!\"  At this moment a knock was heard and Boges entered.  He had come to conduct Nitetis to Kassandane's apartments, where Cambyses was waiting for her.  The eunuch affected an abject humility, and poured forth a stream of flattering words, in which he likened the princess to the sun, the starry heavens, a pure fount of happiness, and a garden of roses.  Nitetis deigned him not a word in reply, but followed, with a beating heart, to the queen's apartment.  In order to keep out the noonday sun and produce a salutary half-light for the blind queen's eyes, her windows were shaded by curtains of green Indian silk.  The floor was covered with a thick Babylonian carpet, soft as moss under the foot.  The walls were faced with a mosaic of ivory, tortoise-shell, gold, silver, malachite, lapis-lazuli, ebony and amber. The seats and couches were of gold covered with lions' skins, and a table of silver stood by the side of the blind queen.  Kassandane was seated in a costly arm-chair.  She wore a robe of violet-blue, embroidered with silver, and over her snow-white hair lay a long veil of delicate lace, woven in Egypt, the ends of which were wound round her neck and tied in a large bow beneath her chin.  She was between sixty and seventy years old; her face, framed, as it were, into a picture by the lace veil, was exquisitely symmetrical in its form, intellectual, kind and benevolent in its expression.  The blind eyes were closed, but those who gazed on her felt that, if open, they would shine with the gentle light of stars.  Even when sitting, her attitude and height showed a tall and stately figure. Indeed her entire appearance was worthy the widow of the great and good Cyrus.  On a low seat at her feet, drawing long threads from a golden spindle, sat the queen's youngest child Atossa,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 05 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 1.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 5.    CHAPTER XIV.  The next day Nitetis removed to the country-house in the hanging-gardens, and began a monotonous, but happy and industrious life there, according to the rules laid down by Croesus.  Every day she was carried to Kassandane and Atossa in a closely shut-up litter.  Nitetis soon began to look upon the blind queen as a beloved and loving mother, and the merry, spirited Atossa nearly made up to her for the loss of her sister Tachot, so far away on the distant Nile.  She could not have desired a better companion than this gay, cheerful girl, whose wit and merriment effectually prevented homesickness or discontent from settling in her friend's heart.  The gravity and earnestness of Nitetis' character were brightened by Atossa's gaiety, and Atossa's exuberant spirits calmed and regulated by the thoughtful nature of Nitetis.  Both Croesus and Kassandane were pleased and satisfied with their new daughter and pupil, and Oropastes extolled her talents and industry daily to Cambyses.  She learnt the Persian language unusually well and quickly; Cambyses only visited his mother when he hoped to find Nitetis there, and presented her continually with rich dresses and costly jewels.  But the highest proof of his favor consisted in his abstaining from visiting her at her house in the hanging-gardens, a line of conduct which proved that he meant to include Nitetis in the small number of his real and lawful wives, a privilege of which many a princess in his harem could not boast.  The grave, beautiful girl threw a strange spell over this strong, turbulent man.  Her presence alone seemed enough to soften his stubborn will, and he would watch their games for hours, his eyes fixed on her graceful movements.  Once, when the ball had fallen into the water, the king sprang in after it, regardless of his costly apparel.  Nitetis screamed on seeing his intention, but Cambyses handed her the dripping toy with the words: \"Take care or I shall be obliged to frighten you again.\"  At the same time he drew from his neck a gold chain set with jewels and gave it to the blushing girl, who thanked him with a look which fully revealed her feelings for her future husband.  Croesus, Kassandane and Atossa soon noticed that Nitetis loved the king. Her former fear of this proud and powerful being had indeed changed into a passionate admiration.  She felt as if she must die if deprived of his presence.  He seemed to her like a, glorious and omnipotent divinity, and her wish to possess him presumptuous and sacrilegious; but its fulfilment shone before her as an idea more beautiful even than return to her native land and reunion with those who, till now, had been her only loved ones.  Nitetis herself was hardly conscious of the strength of her feelings, and believed that when she trembled before the king's arrival it was from fear, and not from her longing to behold him once more.  Croesus, however, had soon discovered the truth, and brought a deep blush to his favorite's cheek by singing to her, old as he was, Anacreon's newest song, which he had learnt at Sais from Ibykus                \"We read the flying courser's name                Upon his side in marks of flame;                And by their turban'd brows alone                The warriors of the East are known.                But in the lover's glowing eyes,                The inlet to his bosom lies;                Through them we see the tiny mark,                Where Love has dropp'd his burning spark\"                                    --Paegnion 15  And thus, in work and amusement, jest, earnest, and mutual love, the weeks and months passed with Nitetis.  Cambyses' command that she was to be happy in his land had fulfilled itself, and by the time the Mesopotamian spring-tide (January, February and March), which succeeds the rainy month of December, was over, and the principal festival of the Asiatics, the New Year, had been solemnized at the equinox, and the May sun had begun to glow in the heavens, Nitetis felt quite at home in Babylon, and all the Persians knew that the young Egyptian princess had quite displaced Phaedime, the daughter of Otanes, in the king's favor, and would certainly become his first and favorite wife.  Boges sank considerably in public estimation, for it was known that Cambyses had ceased to visit the harem, and the chief of the eunuchs had owed all his importance to the women, who were compelled to coax from Cambyses whatever Boges desired for himself or others.  Not a day passed on which the mortified official did not consult with the supplanted favorite Phaedime, as to the best means of ruining Nitetis, but their most finely spun intrigues and artifices were baffled by the strength of king's love and the blameless life of his royal bride.  Phaedime, impatient, mortified, and thirsting for vengeance, was perpetually urging Boges to some decided act; he, on the contrary, advised patience.  At last, however, after many weeks, he came to her full of joy, exclaiming: \"I have devised a little plan which must ruin the Egyptian woman as surely as my name is Boges.  When Bartja comes back, my treasure, our hour will have arrived.\"  While saying this the creature rubbed his fat, soft hands, and, with his perpetual fulsome smile, looked as if he were feasting on some good deed performed.  He did not, however, give Phaedime the faintest idea of the nature of his \"little plan,\" and only answered her pressing questions with the words: \"Better lay your head in a lion's jaws, than your secret in the ears of a woman.  I fully acknowledge your courage, but at the same time advise you to remember that, though a man proves his courage in action, a woman's is shown in obedience.  Obey my words and await the issue in patience.\"  Nebenchari, the oculist, continued to attend the queen, but so carefully abstained from all intercourse with the Persians, that he became a proverb among them for his gloomy, silent ways.  During the day he was to be found in the queen's apartments, silently examining large rolls of papyri, which he called the book of Athotes and the sacred Ambres; at night, by permission of the king and the satraps of Babylon, he often ascended one of the high towers on the walls, called Tritantaechmes, in order to observe the stars.  The Chaldaean priests, the earliest astronomers, would have allowed him to take his observations from the summit of the great temple of Bel, their own observatory, but he refused this offer decidedly, and persisted in his haughty reserve.  When Oropastes attempted to explain to him the celebrated Babylonian sun-dial, introduced by Anaximander of Miletus into Greece, he turned from the Magian with a scornful laugh, saying: \"We knew all this, before you knew the meaning of an hour.\"  Nitetis had shown Nebenchari much kindness, yet he took no interest in her, seemed indeed to avoid her purposely, and on her asking whether she had displeased or offended him, answered: \"For me you are a stranger. How can I reckon those my friends, who can so gladly and so quickly forget those they loved best, their gods, and the customs of their native land?\"  Boges quickly discovered this state of feeling on the part of Nebenchari, and took much pains to secure him as an ally, but the physician rejected the eunuch's flatteries, gifts, and attentions with dignity.  No sooner did an Angare appear in the court of the palace with despatches for the king, than Boges hastened to enquire whether news from the Tapuri had arrived.  At length the desired messenger appeared, bringing word that the rebels were subdued, and Bartja on the point of returning.  Three weeks passed--fresh messengers arrived from day to day announcing the approach of the victorious prince; the streets glittered once more in festal array, the army entered the gates of Babylon, Bartja thanked the rejoicing multitude, and a short time after was in the arms of his blind mother.  Cambyses received his brother with undisguised warmth, and took him to the queen's apartments, when he knew that Nitetis would be there.  For he was sure the Egyptian girl loved him; his previous jealousy seemed a silly fancy now, and he wished to give Bartja an opportunity of seeing how entirely he trusted his bride.  Cambyses' love had made him mild and gentle, unwearied in giving and in doing good.  His wrath slumbered for a season, and around the spot where the heads of those who had suffered capital punishment were exhibited as a warning to their fellow-men, the hungry, screeching crows now wheeled, in vain.  The influence of the insinuating eunuchs (a race who had never been seen within the gates of Cyrus until the incorporation of Media, Lydia and Babylon, in which countries they had filled many of the highest offices at court and in the state), was now waning, and the importance of the noble Achaemenidae increasing in proportion; for Cambyses applied oftener to the latter than to the former for advice in matters relating to the welfare of the country.  The aged Hystaspes, father of Darius, governor of Persia proper and cousin to the king; Pharnaspes, Cambyses' grandfather on the mother's side; Otanes, his uncle and father-in-law.  Intaphernes, Aspathines, Gobryas, Hydarnes, the general Megabyzus, father of Zopyrus, the envoy Prexaspes, the noble Croesus, and the old warrior Araspes; in short, the flower of the ancient Persian aristocracy, were now at the court of Cambyses.  To this must be added that the entire nobility of the realm, the satraps or governors of the provinces, and the chief priests from every town were also assembled at Babylon to celebrate the king's birthday.
