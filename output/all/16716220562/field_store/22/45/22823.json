I will come presently with Marthana, and show you how to make a bandage.\"  The shepherdess cast down her eyes, and passively allowed herself to be conducted to the wounded man.  Meanwhile Marthana had prepared the brown mixture.  Petrus had his staff and felt-hat brought to him, gave Hermas the medicine and desired him to follow him.  Sirona looked after the couple as they went.  \"What a pity for such a fine lad!\" she exclaimed.  \"A purple coat would suit him better than that wretched sheepskin.\"  The mistress shrugged her shoulders, and signing to her daughter said: \"Come to work, Marthana, the sun is already high.  How the days fly! the older one grows the quicker the hours hurry away.\"  \"I must be very young then,\" said the centurion's wife, \"for in this wilderness time seems to me to creep along frightfully slow.  One day is the same as another, and I often feel as if life were standing perfectly still, and my heart pulses with it.  What should I be without your house and the children?--always the same mountain, the same palm-trees, the same faces!--\"  \"But the mountain is glorious, the trees are beautiful!\" answered Dorothea.  \"And if we love the people with whom we are in daily intercourse, even here we may be contented and happy.  At least we ourselves are, so far as the difficulties of life allow.  I have often told you, what you want is work.\"  \"Work! but for whom?\" asked Sirona.  \"If indeed I had children like you! Even in Rome I was not happy, far from it; and yet there was plenty to do and to think about.  Here a procession, there a theatre; but here!  And for whom should I dress even?  My jewels grow dull in my chest, and the moths eat my best clothes.  I am making doll's clothes now of my colored cloak for your little ones.  If some demon were to transform me into a hedge-hog or a grey owl, it would be all the same to me.\"  \"Do not be so sinful,\" said Dorothea gravely, but looking with kindly admiration at the golden hair and lovely sweet face of the young woman. \"It ought to be a pleasure to you to dress yourself for your husband.\"  \"For him?\" said Sirona.  \"He never looks at me, or if he does it is only to abuse me.  The only wonder to me is that I can still be merry at all; nor am I, except in your house, and not there even but when I forget him altogether.\"  \"I will not hear such things said--not another word,\" interrupted Dorothea severely.  \"Take the linen and cooling lotion, Marthana, we will go and bind up Anubis' wound.\"     CHAPTER IV.  Petrus went up the mountain side with Hermas.  The old man followed the youth, who showed him the way, and as he raised his eyes from time to time, he glanced with admiration at his guide's broad shoulders and elastic limbs.  The road grew broader when it reached a little mountain plateau, and from thence the two men walked on side by side, but for some time without speaking till the senator asked: \"How long now has your father lived up on the mountain?\"  \"Many years,\" answered Hermas.  \"But I do not know how many--and it is all one.  No one enquires about time up here among us.\"  The senator stood still a moment and measured his companion with a glance.  \"You have been with your father ever since he came?\"  he asked.  \"He never lets me out of his sight;\" replied Hermas.  \"I have been only twice into the oasis, even to go to the church.\"  \"Then you have been to no school?\"  \"To what school should I go!  My father has taught me to read the Gospels and I could write, but I have nearly forgotten how.  Of what use would it be to me?  We live like praying beasts.\"  Deep bitterness sounded in the last words, and Petrus could see into the troubled spirit of his companion, overflowing as it was with weary disgust, and he perceived how the active powers of youth revolted in aversion against the slothful waste of life, to which he was condemned. He was grieved for the boy, and he was not one of those who pass by those in peril without helping them.  Then he thought of his own sons, who had grown up in the exercise and fulfilment of serious duties, and he owned to himself that the fine young fellow by his side was in no way their inferior, and needed nothing but to be guided aright.  He thoughtfully looked first at the youth and then on the ground, and muttered unintelligible words into his grey beard as they walked on.  Suddenly he drew himself up and nodded decisively; he would make an attempt to save Hermas, and faithful to his own nature, action trod on the heels of resolve.  Where the little level ended the road divided, one path continued to lead upwards, the other deviated to the valley and ended at the quarries.  Petrus was for taking the latter, but Hermas cried out, \"That is not the way to our cave; you must follow me.\"  \"Follow thou me!\"  replied the senator, and the words were spoken with a tone and expression, that left no doubt in the youth's mind as to their double meaning.  \"The day is yet before us, and we will see what my laborers are doing.  Do you know the spot where they quarry the stone?\"  \"How should I not know it?\" said Hermas, passing the senator to lead the way.  \"I know every path from our mountain to the oasis, and to the sea. A panther had its lair in the ravine behind your quarries.\"  \"So we have learnt,\" said Petrus.  \"The thievish beasts have slaughtered two young camels, and the people can neither catch them in their toils nor run them down with dogs.\"  \"They will leave you in peace now,\" said the boy laughing.  \"I brought down the male from the rock up there with an arrow, and I found the mother in a hollow with her young ones.  I had a harder job with her; my knife is so bad, and the copper blade bent with the blow; I had to strangle the gaudy devil with my hands, and she tore my shoulder and bit my arm.  Look! there are the scars.  But thank God, my wounds heal quicker than my father's.  Paulus says, I am like an, earth-worm; when it is cut in two the two halves say good-bye to each other, and crawl off sound and gay, one way, and the other another way.  The young panthers were so funny and helpless, I would not kill them, but I did them up in my sheepskin, and brought them to my father.  He laughed at the little beggars, and then a Nabataean took them to be sold at Clysma to a merchant from Rome.  There and at Byzantium, there is a demand for all kinds of living beasts of prey.  I got some money for them, and for the skins of the old ones, and kept it to pay for my journey, when I went with the others to Alexandria to ask the blessing of the new Patriarch.\"  \"You went to the metropolis?\" asked Petrus.  \"You saw the great structures, that secure the coast from the inroads of the sea, the tall Pharos with the far-shining fire, the strong bridges, the churches, the palaces and temples with their obelisks, pillars, and beautiful paved courts?  Did it never enter your mind to think that it would be a proud thing to construct such buildings?\"  Hermas shook his head.  \"Certainly I would rather live in an airy house with colonnades than in our dingy cavern, but building would never be in my way.  What a long time it takes to put one stone on another!  I am not patient, and when I leave my father I will do something that shall win me fame.  But there are the quarries--\"  Petrus did not let his companion finish his sentence, but interrupted him with all the warmth of youth, exclaiming: \"And do you mean to say that fame cannot be won by the arts of building?  Look there at the blocks and flags, here at the pillars of hard stone.  These are all to be sent to Aila, and there my son Antonius, the elder of the two that you saw just now, is going to build a House of God, with strong walls and pillars, much larger and handsomer than our church in the oasis, and that is his work too.  He is not much older than you are, and already he is famous among the people far and wide.  Out of those red blocks down there my younger son Polykarp will hew noble lions, which are destined to decorate the finest building in the capital itself. When you and I, and all that are now living, shall have been long since forgotten, still it will be said these are the work of the Master Polykarp, the son of Petrus, the Pharanite.  What he can do is certainly a thing peculiar to himself, no one who is not one of the chosen and gifted ones can say, 'I will learn to do that.'  But you have a sound understanding, strong hands and open eyes, and who can tell what else there is hidden in you.  If you could begin to learn soon, it would not yet be too late to make a worthy master of you, but of course he who would rise so high must not be afraid of work.  Is your mind set upon fame?  That is quite right, and I am very glad of it; but you must know that he who would gather that rare fruit must water it, as a noble heathen once said, with the sweat of his brow.  Without trouble and labor and struggles there can be no victory, and men rarely earn fame without fighting for victory.\"  The old man's vehemence was contagious; the lad's spirit was roused, and he exclaimed warmly: \"What do you say? that I am afraid of struggles and trouble?  I am ready to stake everything, even my life, only to win fame. But to measure stone, to batter defenceless blocks with a mallet and chisel, or to join the squares with accurate pains--that does not tempt me.  I should like to win the wreath in the Palaestra by flinging the strongest to the ground, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5495"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 02 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      HOMO SUM  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.   CHAPTER V.  Thanks to the senator's potion Stephanus soon fell asleep.  Paulus sat near him and did not stir; he held his breath, and painfully suppressed even an impulse to cough, so as not to disturb the sick man's light slumbers.  An hour after midnight the old man awoke, and after he had lain meditating for some time with his eyes open, he said thoughtfully: \"You called yourself and us all egotistic, and I certainly am so.  I have often said so to myself; not for the first time to day, but for weeks past, since Hermas came back from Alexandria, and seems to have forgotten how to laugh.  He is not happy, and when I ask myself what is to become of him when I am dead, and if he turns from the Lord and seeks the pleasures of the world, my heart sickens.  I meant it for the best when I brought him with me up to the Holy Mountain, but that was not the only motive--it seemed to me too hard to part altogether from the child. My God! the young of brutes are secure of their mother's faithful love, and his never asked for him when she fled from my house with her seducer. I thought he should at least not lose his father, and that if he grew up far away from the world he would be spared all the sorrow that it had so profusely heaped upon me, I would have brought him up fit for Heaven, and yet through a life devoid of suffering.  And now--and now?  If he is miserable it will be through me, and added to all my other troubles comes this grief.\"  \"You have sought out the way for him,\" interrupted Paulus, \"and the rest will be sure to come; he loves you and will certainly not leave you so long as you are suffering.\"  \"Certainly not?\" asked the sick man sadly.  \"And what weapons has he to fight through life with?\"  \"You gave him the Saviour for a guide; that is enough,\" said Paulus soothingly.  \"There is no smooth road from earth to Heaven, and none can win salvation for another.\"  Stephanus was silent for a long time, then he said: \"It is not even allowed to a father to earn the wretched experience of life for his son, or to a teacher for his pupil.  We may point out the goal, but the way thither is by a different road for each of us.\"  \"And we may thank God for that,\" cried Paulus.  \"For Hermas has been started on the road which you and I had first to find for ourselves.\"  \"You and I,\" repeated the sick man thoughtfully.  \"Yes, each of us has sought his own way, but has enquired only which was his own way, and has never concerned himself about that of the other.  Self! self!--How many years we have dwelt close together, and I have never felt impelled to ask you what you could recall to mind about your youth, and how you were led to grace.  I learnt by accident that you were an Alexandrian, and had been a heathen, and had suffered much for the faith, and with that I was satisfied.  Indeed you do not seem very ready to speak of those long past days.  Our neighbor should be as dear to us as our self, and who is nearer to me than you?  Aye, self and selfishness!  There are many gulfs on the road towards God.\"  \"I have not much to tell,\" said Paulus.  \"But a man never forgets what he once has been.  We may cast the old man from us, and believe we have shaken ourselves free, when lo! it is there again and greets us as an old acquaintance.  If a frog only once comes down from his tree he hops back into the pond again.\"  \"It is true, memory can never die!\" cried the sick man.  \"I can not sleep any more; tell me about your early life and how you became a Christian. When two men have journeyed by the same road, and the moment of parting is at hand, they are fain to ask each other's name and where they came from.\"  Paulus gazed for some time into space, and then he began: \"The companions of my youth called me Menander, the son of Herophilus.  Besides that, I know for certain very little of my youth, for as I have already told you, I have long since ceased to allow myself to think of the world.  He who abandons a thing, but clings to the idea of the thing, continues--\"  \"That sounds like Plato,\" said Stephanus with a smile.  \"All that heathen farrago comes back to me today,\" cried Paulus.  \"I used to know it well, and I have often thought that his face must have resembled that of the Saviour.\"  \"But only as a beautiful song might resemble the voice of an angel,\" said Stephanus somewhat drily.  \"He who plunges into the depths of philosophic systems--\"  \"That never was quite my case,\" said Paulus.  \"I did indeed go through the whole educational course; Grammar, Rhetoric, Dialectic and Music--\"  \"And  Arithmetic,  Geometry, and Astronomy,\" added Stephanus.  \"Those were left to the learned many years since,\" continued Paulus, \"and I was never very eager for learning.  In the school of Rhetoric I remained far behind my fellows, and if Plato was dear to me I owe it to Paedonomus of Athens, a worthy man whom my father engaged to teach us.\"  \"They say he had been a great merchant,\" interrupted Stephanus.  \"Can it be that you were the son of that rich Herophilus, whose business in Antioch was conducted by the worthy Jew Urbib?\"  \"Yes indeed,\" replied Paulus, looking down at the ground in some confusion.  \"Our mode of life was almost royal, and the multitude of our slaves quite sinful.  When I look back on all the vain trifles that my father had to care for, I feel quite giddy.  Twenty sea-going ships in the harbor of Eunostus, and eighty Nile-boats on Lake Mareotis belonged to him.  His profits on the manufacture of papyrus might have maintained a cityfull of poor.  But we needed our revenues for other things.  Our Cyraenian horses stood in marble stalls, and the great hall, in which my father's friends were wont to meet, was like a temple.  But you see how the world takes possession of us, when we begin to think about it! Rather let us leave the past in peace.  You want me to tell you more of myself?  Well; my childhood passed like that of a thousand other rich citizens' sons, only my mother, indeed, was exceptionally beautiful and sweet, and of angelic goodness.\"  \"Every child thinks his own mother the best of mothers,\" murmured the sick man.  \"Mine certainly was the best to me,\" cried Paulus.  \"And yet she was a heathen.  When my father hurt me with severe words of blame, she always had a kind word and loving glance for me.  There was little enough, indeed, to praise in me.  Learning was utterly distasteful to me, and even if I had done better at school, it would hardy have counted for much to my credit, for my brother Apollonius, who was about a year younger than I, learned all the most difficult things as if they were mere child's play, and in dialectic exercises there soon was no rhetorician in Alexandria who could compete with him.  No system was unknown to him, and though no one ever knew of his troubling himself particularly to study, he nevertheless was master of many departments of learning.  There were but two things in which I could beat him--in music, and in all athletic exercises; while he was studying and disputing I was winning garlands in the palaestra.  But at that time the best master of rhetoric and argument was the best man, and my father, who himself could shine in the senate as an ardent and elegant orator, looked upon me as a half idiotic ne'er-do- weel, until one clay a learned client of our house presented him with a pebble on which was carved an epigram to this effect: 'He who would see the noblest gifts of the Greek race, should visit the house of Herophilus, for there he might admire strength and vigor of body in Menander, and the same qualities of mind in Apollonius.'  These lines, which were written in the form of a lute, passed from mouth to mouth, and gratified my father's ambition; from that time he had words of praise for me when my quadriga won the race in the Hippodrome, or when I came home crowned from the wrestling-ring, or the singing match.  My whole life was spent in the baths and the palaestra, or in gay feasting.\"  \"I know it all,\" exclaimed Stephanus interrupting him, \"and the memory of it all often disturbs me.  Did you find it easy to banish these images from your mind?\"  \"At first I had a hard fight,\" sighed Paulus.  \"But for some time now, since I have passed my fortieth year, the temptations of the world torment me less often.  Only I must keep out of the way of the carriers who bring fish from the fishing towns on the sea, and from Raithu to the oasis.\"  Stephanus looked enquiringly at the speaker, and Paulus went on: \"Yes, it is very strange.  I may see men or women--the sea yonder or the mountain here, without ever thinking of Alexandria, but only of sacred things; but when the savor of fish rises up to my nostrils I see the market and fish stalls and the oysters--\"  \"Those of Kanopus are famous,\" interrupted Steplianus, \"they make little pasties there--\"Paulus passed the back of his hand over his bearded lips, exclaiming, \"At the shop of the fat cook--Philemon--in the street of Herakleotis.\"  But he broke off, and cried with an impulse of shame, \"It were better that I should cease telling of my past life.  The day does not dawn yet, and you must try to sleep.\"  \"I cannot sleep,\" sighed Stephanus; \"if you love me go on with your story.\"  \"But do not interrupt me again then,\" said Paulus, and he went on: \"With all this gay life I was not happy--by no means.  When I was alone sometimes, and no longer sitting in the crowd of merry boon-companions and complaisant wenches, emptying the wine cup and crowned with poplar, I often felt as if I were walking on the brink of a dark abyss as if every thing in myself and around me were utterly hollow and empty.  I could stand gazing for hours at the sea, and as the waves"]]]
