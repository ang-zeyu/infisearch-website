Kassandane sent at once to the hanging-gardens, with a request that Nitetis would come to her apartments.  Atossa, as unbridled in her joy as in her grief, ran to meet her friend's litter and flew from one of her attendants to the other crying: \"They are all innocent; we shall not lose one of them--not one!\"  When at last the litter appeared and her loved one, pale as death, within it, she burst into loud sobs, threw her arms round Nitetis as she descended, and covered her with kisses and caresses till she perceived that her friend's strength was failing, that her knees gave way, and she required a stronger support than Atossa's girlish strength could give.  The Egyptian girl was carried insensible into the queen-mother's apartments.  When she opened her eyes, her head-more like a marble piece of sculpture than a living head--was resting on the blind queen's lap, she felt Atossa's warm kisses on her forehead, and Cambyses, who had obeyed his mother's call, was standing at her side.  She gazed on this circle, including all she loved best, with anxious, perplexed looks, and at last, recognizing them one by one, passed her hand across her pale fore head as if to remove a veil, smiled at each, and closed her eyes once more.  She fancied Isis had sent her a beautiful vision, and wished to hold it fast with all the powers of her mind.  Then Atossa called her by her name, impetuously and lovingly.  She opened her eyes again, and again she saw those loving looks that she fancied had only been sent her in a dream.  Yes, that was her own Atossa--this her motherly friend, and there stood, not the angry king, but the man she loved.  And now his lips opened too, his stern, severe eyes rested on her so beseechingly, and he said: \"O Nitetis, awake!  you must not--you cannot possibly be guilty!\"  She moved her head gently with a look of cheerful denial and a happy smile stole across her features, like a breeze of early spring over fresh young roses.  \"She is innocent! by Mithras, it is impossible that she can be guilty,\" cried the king again, and forgetful of the presence of others, he sank on his knees.  A Persian physician came up and rubbed her forehead with a sweet-scented oil, and Nebenchari approached, muttering spells, felt her pulse, shook his head, and administered a potion from his portable medicine-chest. This restored her to perfect consciousness; she raised herself with difficulty into a sitting posture, returned the loving caresses of her two friends, and then turning to Cambyses, asked: \"How could you believe such a thing of me, my King?\"  There was no reproach in her tone, but deep sadness, and Cambyses answered softly, \"Forgive me.\"  Kassandane's blind eyes expressed her gratitude for this self- renunciation on the part of her son, and she said: \"My daughter, I need your forgiveness too.\"  \"But I never once doubted you,\"  cried Atossa, proudly and joyfully kissing her friend's lips.  \"Your letter to Bartja shook my faith in your innocence,\" added Kassandane.  \"And yet it was all so simple and natural,\" answered Nitetis.  \"Here, my mother, take this letter from Egypt.  Croesus will translate it for you. It will explain all.  Perhaps I was imprudent.  Ask your mother to tell you what you would wish to know, my King.  Pray do not scorn my poor, ill sister.  When an Egyptian girl once loves, she cannot forget.  But I feel so frightened.  The end must be near.  The last hours have been so very, very terrible.  That horrible man, Boges, read me the fearful sentence of death, and it was that which forced the poison into my hand.  Ah, my heart!\"  And with these words she fell back into the arms of Kassandane.  Nebenchari rushed forward, and gave her some more drops, exclaiming: \"I thought so!  She has taken poison and her life cannot be saved, though this antidote may possibly prolong it for a few days.\"  Cambyses stood by, pale and rigid, following the physician's slightest movements, and Atossa bathed her friend's forehead with her tears.  \"Let some milk be brought,\"  cried Nebenchari, \"and my large medicine- chest; and let attendants be called to carry her away, for quiet is necessary, above all things.\"  Atossa hastened into the adjoining room; and Cambyses said to the physician, but without looking into his face: \"Is there no hope?\"  \"The poison which she has taken results in certain death.\"  On hearing this the king pushed Nebenchari away from the sick girl, exclaiming: \"She shall live.  It is my will.  Here, eunuch! summon all the physicians in Babylon--assemble the priests and Alobeds!  She is not to die; do you hear?  she must live, I am the king, and I command it.\"  Nitetis opened her eyes as if endeavoring to obey her lord.  Her face was turned towards the window, and the bird of paradise with the gold chain on its foot, was still there, perched on the cypress-tree.  Her eyes fell first on her lover, who had sunk down at her side and was pressing his burning lips to her right hand.  She murmured with a smile:  \"O, this great happiness!\"  Then she saw the bird, and pointed to it with tier left hand, crying: \"Look, look, there is the Phoenix, the bird of Ra!\"  After saying this she closed her eyes and was soon seized by a violent attack of fever.     CHAPTER VII.  Prexaspes, the king's messenger, and one of the highest officials at court, had brought Gaumata, Mandane's lover, whose likeness to Bartja was really most wonderful, to Babylon, sick and wounded as he was.  He was now awaiting his sentence in a dungeon, while Boges, the man who had led him into crime, was nowhere to be found, notwithstanding all the efforts of the police.  His escape had been rendered possible by the trap-door in the hanging-gardens, and greatly assisted by the enormous crowds assembled in the streets.  Immense treasures were found in his house.  Chests of gold and jewels, which his position had enabled him to obtain with great ease, were restored to the royal treasury.  Cambyses, however, would gladly have given ten times as much treasure to secure possession of the traitor.  To Phaedime's despair the king ordered all the inhabitants of the harem, except his mother, Atossa and the dying Nitetis, to be removed to Susa, two days after the accused had been declared innocent.  Several eunuchs of rank were deposed from their offices.  The entire caste was to suffer for the sins of him who had escaped punishment.  Oropastes, who had already entered on his duties as regent of the kingdom, and had clearly proved his non-participation in the crime of which his brother had been proved guilty, bestowed the vacant places exclusively on the Magi.  The demonstration made by the people in favor of Bartja did not come to the king's ears until the crowd had long dispersed.  Still, occupied as he was, almost entirely, by his anxiety for Nitetis, he caused exact information of this illegal manifestation to be furnished him, and ordered the ringleaders to be severely punished. He fancied it was a proof that Bartja had been trying to gain favor with the people, and Cambyses would perhaps have shown his displeasure by some open act, if a better impulse had not told him that he, not Bartja, was the brother who stood in need of forgiveness.  In spite of this, however, he could not get rid of the feeling that Bartja, had been, though innocent, the cause of the sad events which had just happened, nor of his wish to get him out of the way as far as might be; and he therefore gave a ready consent to his brother's wish to start at once for Naukratis.  Bartja took a tender farewell of his mother and sister, and started two days after his liberation.  He was accompanied by Gyges, Zopyrus, and a numerous retinue charged with splendid presents from Cambyses for Sappho. Darius remained behind, kept back by his love for Atossa.  The day too was not far distant, when, by his father's wish, he was to marry Artystone, the daughter of Gobryas.  Bartja parted from his friend with a heavy heart, advising him to be very prudent with regard to Atossa.  The secret had been confided to Kassandane, and she had promised to take Darius' part with the king.  If any one might venture to raise his eyes to the daughter of Cyrus, assuredly it was the son of Hystaspes; he was closely connected by marriage with the royal family, belonged like Cambyses to the Pasargadae, and his family was a younger branch of the reigning dynasty.  His father called himself the highest noble in the realm, and as such, governed the province of Persia proper, the mother-country, to which this enormous world-empire and its ruler owed their origin.  Should the family of Cyrus become extinct, the descendants of Hystaspes would have a well-grounded right to the Persian throne.  Darius therefore, apart from his personal advantages, was a fitting claimant for Atossa's hand.  And yet no one dared to ask the king's consent.  In the gloomy state of mind into which he had been brought by the late events, it was likely that he might refuse it, and such an answer would have to be regarded as irrevocable. So Bartja was obliged to leave Persia in anxiety about the future of these two who were very dear to him.  Croesus promised to act as mediator in this case also, and before Bartja left, made him acquainted with Phanes.  The youth had heard such a pleasant account of the Athenian from Sappho, that he met him with great cordiality, and soon won the fancy of the older and more experienced man, who gave him many a useful hint, and a letter to Theopompus, the Milesian, at Naukratis.  Phanes concluded by asking for a private interview.  Bartja returned to his friends looking grave and thoughtful; soon, however, he forgot his cause of anxiety and joked merrily with them over a farewell cup.  Before he mounted his horse the next morning, Nebenchari asked to be allowed an audience.  He was admitted, and begged Bartja to take the charge of a large written roll for king Amasis.  It contained a detailed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5456"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 07 (#6)"],["body","of Nitetis' sufferings, ending with these words: \"Thus the unhappy victim of your ambitious plans will end her life in a few hours by poison, to the use of which she was driven by despair.  The arbitrary caprices of the mighty can efface all happiness from the life of a human creature, just as we wipe a picture from the tablet with a sponge.  Your servant Nebenchari is pining in a foreign land, deprived of home and property, and the wretched daughter of a king of Egypt dies a miserable and lingering death by her own hand.  Her body will be torn to pieces by dogs and vultures, after the manner of the Persians.  Woe unto them who rob the innocent of happiness here and of rest beyond the grave!\"  Bartja had not been told the contents of this letter, but promised to take it with him; he then, amid the joyful shouts of the people, set up outside the city-gate the stones which, according to a Persian superstition, were to secure him a prosperous journey, and left Babylon.  Nebenchari, meanwhile, prepared to return to his post by Nitetis' dying- bed.  Just as he reached the brazen gates between the harem-gardens and the courts of the large palace, an old man in white robes came up to him. The sight seemed to fill Nebenchari with terror; he started as if the gaunt old man had been a ghost.  Seeing, however, a friendly and familiar smile on the face of the other, he quickened his steps, and, holding out his hand with a heartiness for which none of his Persian acquaintances would have given him credit, exclaimed in Egyptian: \"Can I believe my eyes?  You in Persia, old Hib?  I should as soon have expected the sky to fall as to have the pleasure of seeing you on the Euphrates.  But now, in the name of Osiris, tell me what can have induced you, you old ibis, to leave your warm nest on the Nile and set out on such a long journey eastward.\"  While Nebenchari was speaking, the old man listened in a bowing posture, with his arms hanging down by his side, and when he had finished, looked up into his face with indescribable joy, touched his breast with trembling fingers, and then, falling on the right knee, laying one hand on his heart and raising the other to heaven, cried: \"Thanks be unto thee, great Isis, for protecting the wanderer and permitting him to see his master once more in health and safety.  Ah, child, how anxious I have been!  I expected to find you as wasted and thin as a convict from the quarries; I thought you would have been grieving and unhappy, and here you are as well, and handsome and portly as ever.  If poor old Hib had been in your place he would have been dead long ago.\"  \"Yes, I don't doubt that, old fellow.  I did not leave home of my own will either, nor without many a heartache.  These foreigners are all the children of Seth.  The good and gracious gods are only to be found in Egypt on the shores of the sacred, blessed Nile.\"  \"I don't know much about its being so blessed,\" muttered the old man.  \"You frighten me, father Hib.  What has happened then?\"  \"Happened!  Things have come to a pretty pass there, and you'll hear of it soon enough.  Do you think I should have left house and grandchildren at my age,--going on for eighty,--like any Greek or Phoenician vagabond, and come out among these godless foreigners (the gods blast and destroy them!), if I could possibly have staid on in Egypt?\"  \"But tell me what it's all about.\"  \"Some other time, some other time.  Now you must take me to your own house, and I won't stir out of it as long as we are in this land of Typhon.\"  The old man said this with so much emphasis, that Nebenchiari could not help smiling and saying: \"Have they treated you so very badly then, old man?\"  \"Pestilence and Khamsin!\" blustered the old man.       [The south-west wind, which does so much injury to the crops in the      Nile valley.  It is known to us as the Simoom, the wind so perilous      to travellers in the desert.]  \"There's not a more good-for-nothing Typhon's brood on the face of the earth than these Persians.  I only wonder they're not all red-haired and leprous.  Ah, child, two whole days I have been in this hell already, and all that time I was obliged to live among these blasphemers.  They said no one could see you; you were never allowed to leave Nitetis' sick-bed. Poor child!  I always said this marriage with a foreigner would come to no good, and it serves Amasis right if his children give him trouble. His conduct to you alone deserves that.\"  \"For shame, old man!\"  \"Nonsense, one must speak one's mind sometimes.  I hate a king, who comes from nobody knows where.  Why, when he was a poor boy he used to steal your father's nuts, and wrench the name-plates off the house-doors.  I saw he was a good-for-nothing fellow then.  It's a shame that such people should be allowed to...\"  \"Gently, gently, old man.  We are not all made of the same stuff, and if there was such a little difference between you and Amasis as boys, it, is your own fault that, now you are old men, he has outstripped you so far.  \"My father and grandfather were both servants in the temple, and of course I followed in their footsteps.\"  \"Quite right; it is the law of caste, and by that rule, Amasis ought never to have become anything higher than a poor army-captain at most.\"  \"It is not every one who's got such an easy conscience as this upstart fellow.\"  \"There you are again!  For shame, Hib!  As long as I can remember, and that is nearly half a century, every other word with you has been an abusive one.  When I was a child your ill-temper was vented on me, and now the king has the benefit of it.\"  \"Serves him right!  All, if you only knew all!  It's now seven months since .  .  .\"  \"I can't stop to listen to you now.  At the rising of the seven stars I will send a slave to take you to my rooms.  Till then you must stay in your present lodging, for I must go to my patient.\"  \"You must?--Very well,--then go and leave poor old Hib here to die. I can't possibly live another hour among these creatures.\"  \"What would you have me do then?\"  \"Let me live with you as long as we are in Persia.\"  \"Have they treated you so very roughly?\"  \"I should think they had indeed.  It is loathsome to think of.  They forced me to eat out of the same pot with them and cut my bread with the same knife.  An infamous Persian, who had lived many years in Egypt, and travelled here with us, had given them a list of all the things and actions, which we consider unclean.  They took away my knife when I was going to shave myself.  A good-for-nothing wench kissed me on the forehead, before I could prevent it.  There, you needn't laugh; it will be a month at least before I can get purified from all these pollutions. I took an emetic, and when that at last began to take effect, they all mocked and sneered at me.  But that was not all.  A cursed cook-boy nearly beat a sacred kitten to death before my very eyes.  Then an ointment-mixer, who had heard that I was your servant, made that godless Bubares ask me whether I could cure diseases of the eye too.  I said yes, because you know in sixty years it's rather hard if one can't pick up something from one's master.  Bubares was interpreter between us, and the shameful fellow told him to say that he was very much disturbed about a dreadful disease in his eyes.  I asked what it was, and received for answer that he could not tell one thing from another in the dark!\"  \"You should have told him that the best remedy for that was to light a candle.\"  \"Oh, I hate the rascals!  Another hour among them will be the death of me!\"  \"I am sure you behaved oddly enough among these foreigners,\" said Nebenchiari smiling, \"you must have made them laugh at you, for the Persians are generally very polite, well-behaved people.  Try them again, only once.  I shall be very glad to take you in this evening, but I can't possibly do it before.\"  \"It is as I thought!  He's altered too, like everybody else!  Osiris is dead and Seth rules the world again.\"  \"Farewell!  When the seven stars rise, our old Ethiopian slave, Nebununf, will wait for you here.\"  \"Nebununf, that old rogue?  I never want to see him again.\"  \"Yes, the very same.\"  \"Him--well it's a good thing, when people stay as they were.  To be sure I know some people who can't say so much of themselves, and who instead of minding their own business, pretend to heal inward diseases, and when a faithful old servant .  .  .\"  \"Hold your tongue, and wait patiently till evening.\"  These last words were spoken seriously, and produced the desired impression.  The old man made another obeisance, and before his master left him, said: \"I came here under the protection of Phanes, the former commander of the Greek mercenaries.  He wishes very much to speak with you.\"  \"That is his concern.  He can come to me.\"  \"You never leave that sick girl, whose eyes are as sound as .  .  .\"  \"Hib!\"  \"For all I care she may have a cataract in both.  May Phanes come to you this evening?\"  \"I wished to be alone with you.\"  \"So did I; but the Greek seems to be in a great hurry, and he knows nearly everything that I have to tell you.\"  \"Have you been gossiping then?\"  \"No--not exactly--but .  .  .\"  \"I always thought you were a man to be trusted.\"  \"So I was.  But this Greek knows already a great deal of what I know, and the rest .  .  .\"  \"Well?\"  \"The rest he got out of me, I hardly know how myself.  If I did not wear this amulet against an evil eye, I should have been obliged .  .  .\"  \"Yes, yes, I know the Athenian--I can forgive you.  I should like him to come with you this evening.  But I see the sun is already high in the heavens.  I have no time to lose.  Tell me in a few words what has happened.\"  \"I thought this evening .  .  .\"  \"No, I must have at least a general idea of what has happened before I see the Athenian.  Be brief.\"  \"You have been robbed!\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"Is not that enough?\"  \"Answer me.  Is that all?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"Then farewell.\"  \"But Nebenchari!\"  The"]]]
