A man like Orion could afford to keep them, of course; for the abbess had said that every one knew that the great Mukaukas was a very rich man, though even the chief magistrate of the city could not fully satisfy himself concerning the enormous amount of property left.  Well, well; God's ways were past finding out.  Why should He smother one under heaps of gold, while He gave thousands of poor creatures too little to satisfy their hunger!  By the end of this torrent of words the two women had reached the house; and not till then was Paula clear in her own mind: Away, away with the passion which still strove for the mastery, whether it were in deed hatred or love!  For she felt that she could not rightly enjoy her recovered freedom, her new and quiet happiness in the pretty home she owed to the physician's thoughtful care, till she had finally given up Orion and broken the last tie that had bound her to his house.  Could she desire anything more than what the present had to offer her? She had found a true haven of rest where she lacked for nothing that she could desire for herself after listening to the admonitions of Philip pus.  Round her were good souls who felt with and for her, many occupations for which she was well-fitted, and which suited her tastes, with ample opportunities of bestowing and winning love.  Then, a few steps through pleasant shades took her to the convent where she could every day attend divine service among pious companions of her own creed, as she had done in her childhood.  She had longed intensely for such food for the spirit, and the abbess--who was the widow of a distinguished patrician of Constantinople and had known Paula's parents--could supply it in abundance.  How gladly she talked to the girl of the goodness and the beauty of those to whom she owed her being and whom she had so early lost!  She could pour out to this motherly soul all that weighed on her own, and was received by her as a beloved daughter of her old age.  And her hosts--what kind-hearted though singular folks! nay, in their way, remarkable.  She had never dreamed that there could be on earth any beings at once so odd and so lovable.  First there was old Rufinus, the head of the house, a vigorous, hale old man, who, with his long silky, snow-white hair and beard, looked something like the aged St. John and something like a warrior grown grey in service.  What an amiable spirit of childlike meekness he had, in spite of the rough ways he sometimes fell into.  Though inclined to be contradictory in his intercourse with his fellow-men, he was merry and jocose when his views were opposed to theirs.  She had never met a more contented soul or a franker disposition, and she could well understand how much it must fret and gall such a man to live on,--day after day, appearing, in one respect at any rate, different from what he really was. For he, too, belonged to her confession; but, though he sent his wife and daughter to worship in the convent chapel, he himself was compelled to profess himself a Coptic Christian, and submit to the necessity of attending a Jacobite church with all his family on certain holy days, averse as he was to its unattractive form of worship.  Rufinus possessed a sufficient fortune to secure him a comfortable maintenance; and yet he was hard at work, in his own way, from morning till night.  Not that his labors brought him any revenues; on the contrary, they led to claims on his resources; every one knew that he was a man of good means, and this would have certainly involved him in persecution if the Patriarch's spies had discovered him to be a Melchite, resulting in exile and probably the confiscation of his goods.  Hence it was necessary to exercise caution, and if the old man could have found a purchaser for his house and garden, in a city where there were ten times as many houses empty as occupied, he would long since have set out with all his household to seek a new home.  Most aged people of vehement spirit and not too keen intellect, adopt a saying as a stop-gap or resting-place, and he was fond of using two phrases one of which ran:  \"As sure as man is the standard of all things\" and the other--referring to his house--\"As sure as I long to be quit of this lumber.\"  But the lumber consisted of a well-built and very spacious dwellinghouse, with a garden which had commanded a high price in earlier times on account of its situation near the river.  He himself had acquired it at very small cost shortly before the Arab incursion, and--so quickly do times change--he had actually bought it from a Jacobite Christian who had been forced by the Melchite Patriarch Cyrus, then in power, to fly in haste because he had found means to convert his orthodox slaves to his confession.  It was Philippus who had persuaded his accomplished and experienced friend to come to Memphis; he had clung to him faithfully, and they assisted each other in their works.  Rufinus' wife, a frail, ailing little woman, with a small face and rather hollow cheeks, who must once have been very attractive and engaging, might have passed for his daughter; she was, in fact, twenty years younger than her husband.  It was evident that she had suffered much in the course of her life, but had taken it patiently and all for the best.  Her restless husband had caused her the greatest trouble and alarms, and yet she exerted herself to the utmost to make his life pleasant.  She had the art of keeping every obstacle and discomfort out of his way, and guessed with wonderful instinct what would help him, comfort him, and bring him joy.  The physician declared that her stooping attitude, her bent head, and the enquiring expression of her bright, black eyes were the result of her constant efforts to discover even a straw that might bring harm to Rufinus if his callous and restless foot should tread on it.  Their daughter Pulcheria, was commonly called \"Pul\" for short, to save time, excepting when the old man spoke of her by preference as \"the poor child.\"  There was at all times something compassionate in his attitude towards his daughter; for he rarely looked at her without asking himself what could become of this beloved child when he, who was so much older, should have closed his eyes in death and his Joanna perhaps should soon have followed him; while Pulcheria, seeing her mother take such care of her father that nothing was left for her to do, regarded herself as the most superfluous creature on earth and would have been ready at any time to lay down her life for her parents, for the abbess, for her faith, for the leech; nay, and though she had known her for no more than two days, even for Paula.  However, she was a very pretty, well-grown girl, with great open blue eyes and a dreamy expression, and magnificent red-gold hair which could hardly be matched in all Egypt.  Her father had long known of her desire to enter the convent as a novice and become a nursing sister; but though he had devoted his whole life to a similar impulse, he had more than once positively refused to accede to her wishes, for he must ere long be gathered to his fathers and then her mother, while she survived him, would want some one else to wear herself out for.  Just now \"Pul\" was longing less than usual to take the veil; for she had found in Paula a being before whom she felt small indeed, and to whom her unenvious soul, yearning and striving for the highest, could look up in satisfied and rapturous admiration.  In addition to this, there were under her own roof two sufferers needing her care: Rustem, the wounded Masdakite, and the Persian girl.  Neforis, who since the fearful hour of her husband's death had seemed stunned and indifferent to all the claims of daily life, living only in her memories of the departed, had been more than willing to leave to the physician the disposal of these two and their removal from her house.  In the evening after Paula's arrival Philippus had consulted with his friends as to the reception of these new guests, and the old man had interrupted him, as soon as he raised the question of pecuniary indemnification, exclaiming:  \"They are all very welcome.  If they have wounds, we will make them heal; if their heads are turned, we will screw them the right way round; if their souls are dark, we will light up a flame in them.  If the fair Paula takes a fancy to us, she and her old woman may stay as long as it suits her and us.  We made her welcome with all our hearts; but, on the other hand, you must understand that we must be free to bid her farewell --as free as she is to depart.  It is impossible ever to know exactly how such grand folks will get on with humble ones, and as sure as I long to be quit of this piece of lumber I might one day take it into my head to leave it to the owls and jackals and fare forth, staff in hand.--You know me.  As to indemnification--we understand each other.  A full purse hangs behind the sick, and the sound one has ten times more than she needs, so they may pay.  You must decide how much; only--for the women's sake, and I mean it seriously--be liberal.  You know what I need Mammon for; and it would be well for Joanna if she had less need to turn over every silver piece before she spends it in the housekeeping.  Besides, the lady herself will be more comfortable if she contributes to pay for the food and drink.  It would ill beseem the daughter of Thomas to be down every evening under the roof of such birds of passage as we are with thanks for favors received.  When each one pays his share we stand on a footing of give and take; and if either one feels any particular affection to another it is not strangled by 'thanks' or 'take it;' it is love for love's sake and a joy to both parties.\"  \"Amen,\" said the leech; and Paula had been quite satisfied by her friend's arrangements.  By the next day she felt herself one of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5521"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 05 (#3)"],["body"," household, though she every hour found something that could not fail to strike her as strange.     CHAPTER XIX.  When Paula had eaten with Rufinus and his family after the funeral ceremonies, she went into the garden with Pul and the old man--it had been impossible to induce Perpetua to sit at the same table with her mistress.  The sun was now low, and its level beams gave added lustre to the colors of the flowers and to the sheen of the thick, metallic foliage of the south, which the drought and scorching heat had still spared. A bright-hued humped ox and an ass were turning the wheel which raised cooling waters from the Nile and poured them into a large tank from which they flowed through narrow rivulets to irrigate the beds.  This toil was now very laborious, for the river had fallen to so low a level as to give cause for anxiety, even at this season of extreme ebb.  Numbers of birds with ruffled feathers, with little splints on their legs, or with sadly drooping heads, were going to roost in small cages hung from the branches to protect them from cats and other beasts of prey; to each, as he went by, Rufinus spoke a kindly word, or chirruped to encourage and cheer it. Aromatic odors filled the garden, and rural silence; every object shone in golden glory, even the black back of the negro working at the water- wheel, and the white and yellow skin of the ox; while the clear voices of the choir of nuns thrilled through the convent-grove.  Pul listened, turning her face to meet it, and crossing her arms over her heart.  Her father pointed to her as he said to Paula:  \"That is where her heart is.  May she ever have her God before her eyes! That cannot but be the best thing for a woman.  Still, among such as we are, we must hold to the rule:  Every man for his fellowman on earth, in the name of the merciful Lord!--Can our wise and reasonable Father in Heaven desire that brother should neglect brother, or--as in our case--a child forsake its parents?\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied Paula.  \"For my own part, nothing keeps me from taking the veil but my hope of finding my long-lost father; I, like your Pulcheria, have often longed for the peace of the cloister.  How piously rapt your daughter stands there!  What a sweet and touching sight!--In my heart all was dark and desolate; but here, among you all, it is already beginning to feel lighter, and here, if anywhere, I shall recover what I lost in my other home.--Happy child!  Could you not fancy, as she stands there in the evening light, that the pure devotion which fills her soul, radiated from her?  If I were not afraid of disturbing her, and if I were worthy, how gladly would I join my prayers to hers!\"  \"You have a part in them as it is,\" replied the old man with a smile. \"At this moment St. Cecilia appears to her under the guise of your features.  We will ask her--you will see.\"  \"No, leave her alone!\"  entreated Paula with a blush, and she led Rufinus away to the other end of the garden.  They soon reached a spot where a high hedge of thorny shrubs parted the old man's plot from that of Susannah.  Rufinus here pricked up his ears and then angrily exclaimed:  \"As sure as I long to be quit of this lumber, they are cutting my hedge again!  Only last evening I caught one of the slaves just as he was going to work on the branches; but how could I get at the black rascal through the thorns?  It was to make a peep-hole for curious eyes, or for spies, for the Patriarch knows how to make use of a petticoat; but I will be even with them!  Do you go on, pray, as if you had seen and heard nothing; I will fetch my whip.\"  The old man hurried away, and Paula was about to obey him; but scarcely had he disappeared when she heard herself called in a shrill girl's voice through a gap in the hedge, and looking round, she spied a pretty face between the boughs which had yesterday been forced asunder by a man's hands--like a picture wreathed with greenery.  Even in the twilight she recognized it at once, and when Katharina put her curly head forward, and said in a beseeching tone: \"May I get through, and will you listen to me?\"  she gladly signified her consent.  The water-wagtail, heedless of Paula's hand held out to help her, slipped through the gap so nimbly that it was evident that she had not long ceased surmounting such obstacles in her games with Mary.  As swift as the wind she came down on her feet, holding out her arms to rush at Paula; but she suddenly let them fall in visible hesitancy, and drew back a step.  Paula, however, saw her embarrassment; she drew the girl to her, kissed her forehead, and gaily exclaimed:  \"Trespassing!  And why could you not come in by the gate?  Here comes my host with his hippopotamus thong.--Stop, stop, good Rufinus, for the breach effected in your flowery wall was intended against me and not against you.  There stands the hostile power, and I should be greatly surprised if you did not recognize her as a neighbor?\"  \"Recognize her?\" said the old man, whose wrath was quickly appeased. \"Do we know each other, fair damsel--yes or no?  It is an open question.\"  \"Of course!\"  cried Katharina, \"I have seen you a hundred times from the gnat-tower.\"  \"You have had less pleasure than I should have had, if I had been so happy as to see you.--We came across each other about a year ago.  I was then so happy as to find you in my large peach-tree, which to this day takes the liberty of growing over your garden-plot.\"  \"I was but a child then,\" laughed Katharina, who very well remembered how the old man, whose handsome white head she had always particularly admired, had spied her out among the boughs of his peach-tree and had advised her, with a good-natured nod, to enjoy herself there.  \"A child!\" repeated Rufinus.  \"And now we are quite grown up and do not care to climb so high, but creep humbly through our neighbor's hedge.\"  \"Then you really are strangers?\"  cried Paula in surprise.  \"And have you never met Pulcheria, Katharina?\"  \"Pul?--oh, how glad I should have been to call her!\"  said Katharina. \"I have been on the point of it a hundred times; for her mere appearance makes one fall in love with her,--but my mother. . . .\"  \"Well, and what has your mother got to say against her neighbors?\"  asked Rufinus.  \"I believe we are peaceable folks who do no one any harm.\"  \"No, no, God forbid!  But my mother has her own way of viewing things; you and she are strangers still, and as you are so rarely to be seen in church. . . .\"  \"She naturally takes us for the ungodly.  Tell her that she is mistaken, and if you are Paula's friend and you come to see her--but prettily, through the gate, and not through the hedge, for it will be closely twined again by to-morrow morning--if you come here, I say, you will find that we have a great deal to do and a great many creatures to nurse and care for--poor human creatures some of them, and some with fur or feathers, just as it comes; and man serves his Maker if he only makes life easier to the beings that come in his way; for He loves them all. Tell that to your mother, little wagtail, and come again very often.\"  \"Thank you very much.  But let me ask you, if I may, where you heard that odious nickname?  I hate it.\"  \"From the same person who told you the secret that my Pulcheria is called Pul!\"  said Rufinus; he laughed and bowed and left the two girls together.  \"What a dear old man!\" cried Katharina.  \"Oh, I know quite well how he spends his Days!  And his pretty wife and Pul--I know them all.  How often I have watched them--I will show you the place one day!  I can see over the whole garden, only not what goes on near the convent on the other side of the house, or beyond those trees.  You know my mother; if she once dislikes any one...  But Pul, you understand, would be such a friend for me!\"  \"Of course she would,\" replied Paula.  \"And a girl of your age must chose older companions than little Mary.\"  \"Oh, you shall not say a word against her!\"  cried Katharina eagerly. \"She is only ten years old, but many a grown-up person is not so upright or so capable as I have found her during these last few miserable days.\"  \"Poor child!\"  said Paula stroking her hair.  At this a bitter sob broke suddenly and passionately from Katharina; she tried with all her might to suppress it, but could not succeed.  Her fit of weeping was so violent that she could not utter a word, till Paula had led her to a bench under a spreading sycamore, had induced her with gentle force to sit down by her side, clasping her in her arms like a suffering child, and speaking to her words of comfort and encouragement.  Birds without number were going to rest in the dense branches overhead, owls and bats had begun their nocturnal raids, the sky put on its spangled glory of gold and silver stars, from the western end of the town came the jackals' bark as they left their lurking-places among the ruined houses and stole out in search of prey, the heavy dew, falling through the mild air silently covered the leaves, the grass, and the flowers; the garden was more powerfully fragrant now than during the day-time, and Paula felt that it was high time to take refuge from the mists that came up from the shallow stream.  But still she lingered while the little maiden poured out all that weighed upon her, all she repented of, believing she could never atone for it; and then all she had gone through, thinking it must break her heart, and all she still had to live down and drive out of her mind.  She told Paula how Orion had wooed her, how much she loved him, how her heart had been tortured by jealousy of her, Paula, and how she had allowed herself to be led away into bearing false witness before the judges.  And then she went on to say it was Mary who had first opened her eyes to the abyss by which she was standing.  In the afternoon after the death of the Mukaukas she had gone with her mother to the governor's house to join in her friends' lamentations.  She had"]]]
