Fosh-bal-soj was possessed of enormous strength and he was fighting for his life.  The Englishman soon realized that the battle was going against him.  Already his lungs were pounding painfully for air as he reached for his pistol.  It was with difficulty that he drew it from its holster, and even then, with death staring him in the face, he thought of his precious ammunition.  \"Can't waste it,\" he thought; and slipping his fingers to the barrel he raised the weapon and struck Fosh-bal-soj a terrific blow between the eyes.  Instantly the clawlike fingers released their hold, and the creature sank limply to the floor beside Bradley, who lay for several minutes gasping painfully in an effort to regain his breath.  When he was able, he rose, and leaned close over the Wieroo, lying silent and motionless, his wings drooping limply and his great, round eyes staring blankly toward the ceiling.  A brief examination convinced Bradley that the thing was dead, and with the conviction came an overwhelming sense of the dangers which must now confront him; but how was he to escape?  His first thought was to find some means for concealing the evidence of his deed and then to make a bold effort to escape.  Stepping to the second door he pushed it gently open and peered in upon what seemed to be a store room.  In it was a litter of cloth such as the Wieroos' robes were fashioned from, a number of chests painted blue and white, with white hieroglyphics painted in bold strokes upon the blue and blue hieroglyphics upon the white.  In one corner was a pile of human skulls reaching almost to the ceiling and in another a stack of dried Wieroo wings.  The chamber was as irregularly shaped as the other and had but a single window and a second door at the further end, but was without the exit through the roof and, most important of all, there was no creature of any sort in it.  As quickly as possible Bradley dragged the dead Wieroo through the doorway and closed the door; then he looked about for a place to conceal the corpse.  One of the chests was large enough to hold the body if the knees were bent well up, and with this idea in view Bradley approached the chest to open it.  The lid was made in two pieces, each being hinged at an opposite end of the chest and joining nicely where they met in the center of the chest, making a snug, well-fitting joint. There was no lock.  Bradley raised one half the cover and looked in. With a smothered \"By Jove!\" he bent closer to examine the contents--the chest was about half filled with an assortment of golden trinkets. There were what appeared to be bracelets, anklets and brooches of virgin gold.  Realizing that there was no room in the chest for the body of the Wieroo, Bradley turned to seek another means of concealing the evidence of his crime.  There was a space between the chests and the wall, and into this he forced the corpse, piling the discarded robes upon it until it was entirely hidden from sight; but now how was he to make good his escape in the bright glare of that early Spring day?  He walked to the door at the far end of the apartment and cautiously opened it an inch.  Before him and about two feet away was the blank wall of another building.  Bradley opened the door a little farther and looked in both directions.  There was no one in sight to the left over a considerable expanse of roof-top, and to the right another building shut off his line of vision at about twenty feet.  Slipping out, he turned to the right and in a few steps found a narrow passageway between two buildings.  Turning into this he passed about half its length when he saw a Wieroo appear at the opposite end and halt.  The creature was not looking down the passageway; but at any moment it might turn its eyes toward him, when he would be immediately discovered.  To Bradley's left was a triangular niche in the wall of one of the houses and into this he dodged, thus concealing himself from the sight of the Wieroo.  Beside him was a door painted a vivid yellow and constructed after the same fashion as the other Wieroo doors he had seen, being made up of countless narrow strips of wood from four to six inches in length laid on in patches of about the same width, the strips in adjacent patches never running in the same direction.  The result bore some resemblance to a crazy patchwork quilt, which was heightened when, as in one of the doors he had seen, contiguous patches were painted different colors.  The strips appeared to have been bound together and to the underlying framework of the door with gut or fiber and also glued, after which a thick coating of paint had been applied. One edge of the door was formed of a straight, round pole about two inches in diameter that protruded at top and bottom, the projections setting in round holes in both lintel and sill forming the axis upon which the door swung.  An eccentric disk upon the inside face of the door engaged a slot in the frame when it was desired to secure the door against intruders.  As Bradley stood flattened against the wall waiting for the Wieroo to move on, he heard the creature's wings brushing against the sides of the buildings as it made its way down the narrow passage in his direction.  As the yellow door offered the only means of escape without detection, the Englishman decided to risk whatever might lie beyond it, and so, boldly pushing it in, he crossed the threshold and entered a small apartment.  As he did so, he heard a muffled ejaculation of surprise, and turning his eyes in the direction from whence the sound had come, he beheld a wide-eyed girl standing flattened against the opposite wall, an expression of incredulity upon her face.  At a glance he saw that she was of no race of humans that he had come in contact with since his arrival upon Caprona--there was no trace about her form or features of any relationship to those low orders of men, nor was she appareled as they--or, rather, she did not entirely lack apparel as did most of them.  A soft hide fell from her left shoulder to just below her left hip on one side and almost to her right knee on the other, a loose girdle was about her waist, and golden ornaments such as he had seen in the blue-and-white chest encircled her arms and legs, while a golden fillet with a triangular diadem bound her heavy hair above her brows.  Her skin was white as from long confinement within doors; but it was clear and fine.  Her figure, but partially concealed by the soft deerskin, was all curves of symmetry and youthful grace, while her features might easily have been the envy of the most feted of Continental beauties.  If the girl was surprised by the sudden appearance of Bradley, the latter was absolutely astounded to discover so wondrous a creature among the hideous inhabitants of the City of Human Skulls.  For a moment the two looked at one another in unconcealed consternation, and then Bradley spoke, using to the best of his poor ability, the common tongue of Caspak.  \"Who are you,\" he asked, \"and from where do you come?  Do not tell me that you are a Wieroo.\"  \"No,\" she replied, \"I am no Wieroo.\"  And she shuddered slightly as she pronounced the word.  \"I am a Galu; but who and what are you?  I am sure that you are no Galu, from your garments; but you are like the Galus in other respects.  I know that you are not of this frightful city, for I have been here for almost ten moons, and never have I seen a male Galu brought hither before, nor are there such as you and I, other than prisoners in the land of Oo-oh, and these are all females. Are you a prisoner, then?\"  He told her briefly who and what he was, though he doubted if she understood, and from her he learned that she had been a prisoner there for many months; but for what purpose he did not then learn, as in the midst of their conversation the yellow door swung open and a Wieroo with a robe slashed with yellow entered.  At sight of Bradley the creature became furious.  \"Whence came this reptile?\" it demanded of the girl.  \"How long has it been here with you?\"  \"It came through the doorway just ahead of you,\" Bradley answered for the girl.  The Wieroo looked relieved.  \"It is well for the girl that this is so,\" it said, \"for now only you will have to die.\" And stepping to the door the creature raised its voice in one of those uncanny, depressing wails.  The Englishman looked toward the girl.  \"Shall I kill it?\" he asked, half drawing his pistol.  \"What is best to do?--I do not wish to endanger you.\"  The Wieroo backed toward the door.  \"Defiler!\" it screamed.  \"You dare to threaten one of the sacred chosen of Luata!\"  \"Do not kill him,\" cried the girl, \"for then there could be no hope for you.  That you are here, alive, shows that they may not intend to kill you at all, and so there is a chance for you if you do not anger them; but touch him in violence and your bleached skull will top the loftiest pedestal of Oo-oh.\"  \"And what of you?\" asked Bradley.  \"I am already doomed,\" replied the girl; \"I am cos-ata-lo.\"  \"Cos-ata-lo! cos-ata-lu!\"  What did these phrases mean that they were so oft repeated by the denizens of Oo-oh?  Lu and lo, Bradley knew to mean man and woman; ata; was employed variously to indicate life, eggs, young, reproduction and kindred subjects; cos was a negative; but in combination they were meaningless to the European.  \"Do you mean they will kill you?\" asked Bradley.  \"I but wish that they would,\" replied the girl.  \"My fate is to be worse than death--in just a few nights more, with the coming of the new moon.\"  \"Poor she-snake!\" snapped the Wieroo.  \"You are to become sacred above all other shes.  He Who Speaks for Luata has chosen you for himself. Today you go to his temple--\" the Wieroo used a phrase meaning literally High Place--\"where you will receive the sacred commands.\"  The girl shuddered and cast a sorrowful glance toward Bradley.  \"Ah,\" she sighed, \"if I could but see my beloved "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/553"],["title","Out of Time's Abyss (#8)"],["body","once again!\"  The man stepped suddenly close to her side before the Wieroo could interpose and in a low voice asked her if there was no way by which he might encompass her escape.  She shook her head sorrowfully.  \"Even if we escaped the city,\" she replied, \"there is the big water between the island of Oo-oh and the Galu shore.\"  \"And what is beyond the city, if we could leave it?\" pursued Bradley.  \"I  may only guess from what I have heard since I was brought here,\" she answered; \"but by reports and chance remarks I take it to be a beautiful land in which there are but few wild beasts and no men, for only the Wieroos live upon this island and they dwell always in cities of which there are three, this being the largest.  The others are at the far end of the island, which is about three marches from end to end and at its widest point about one march.\"  From his own experience and from what the natives on the mainland had told him, Bradley knew that ten miles was a good day's march in Caspak, owing to the fact that at most points it was a trackless wilderness and at all times travelers were beset by hideous beasts and reptiles that greatly impeded rapid progress.  The two had spoken rapidly but were now interrupted by the advent through the opening in the roof of several Wieroos who had come in answer to the alarm it of the yellow slashing had uttered.  \"This jaal-lu,\"  cried the offended one, \"has threatened me.  Take its hatchet from it and make it fast where it can do no harm until He Who Speaks for Luata has said what shall be done with it.  It is one of those strange creatures that Fosh-bal-soj discovered first above the Band-lu country and followed back toward the beginning.  He Who Speaks for Luata sent Fosh-bal-soj to fetch him one of the creatures, and here it is.  It is hoped that it may be from another world and hold the secret of the cos-ata-lus.\"  The Wieroos approached boldly to take Bradley's \"hatchet\" from him, their leader having indicated the pistol hanging in its holster at the Englishman's hip, but the first one went reeling backward against his fellows from the blow to the chin which Bradley followed up with a rush and the intention to clean up the room in record time; but he had reckoned without the opening in the roof.  Two were down and a great wailing and moaning was arising when reinforcements appeared from above.  Bradley did not see them; but the girl did, and though she cried out a warning, it came too late for him to avoid a large Wieroo who dived headforemost for him, striking him between the shoulders and bearing him to the floor.  Instantly a dozen more were piling on top of him.  His pistol was wrenched from its holster and he was securely pinioned down by the weight of numbers.  At a word from the Wieroo of the yellow slashing who evidently was a person of authority, one left and presently returned with fiber ropes with which Bradley was tightly bound.  \"Now bear him to the Blue Place of Seven Skulls,\" directed the chief Wieroo, \"and one take the word of all that has passed to Him Who Speaks for Luata.\"  Each of the creatures raised a hand, the back against its face, as though in salute.  One seized Bradley and carried him through the yellow doorway to the roof from whence it rose upon its wide-spread wings and flapped off across the roof-tops of Oo-oh with its heavy burden clutched in its long talons.  Below him Bradley could see the city stretching away to a distance on every hand.  It was not as large as he had imagined, though he judged that it was at least three miles square.  The houses were piled in indescribable heaps, sometimes to a height of a hundred feet.  The streets and alleys were short and crooked and there were many areas where buildings had been wedged in so closely that no light could possibly reach the lowest tiers, the entire surface of the ground being packed solidly with them.  The colors were varied and startling, the architecture amazing.  Many roofs were cup or saucer-shaped with a small hole in the center of each, as though they had been constructed to catch rain-water and conduct it to a reservoir beneath; but nearly all the others had the large opening in the top that Bradley had seen used by these flying men in lieu of doorways.  At all levels were the myriad poles surmounted by grinning skulls; but the two most prominent features of the city were the round tower of human skulls that Bradley had noted earlier in the day and another and much larger edifice near the center of the city. As they approached it, Bradley saw that it was a huge building rising a hundred feet in height from the ground and that it stood alone in the center of what might have been called a plaza in some other part of the world.  Its various parts, however, were set together with the same strange irregularity that marked the architecture of the city as a whole; and it was capped by an enormous saucer-shaped roof which projected far beyond the eaves, having the appearance of a colossal Chinese coolie hat, inverted.  The Wieroo bearing Bradley passed over one corner of the open space about the large building, revealing to the Englishman grass and trees and running water beneath.  They passed the building and about five hundred yards beyond the creature alighted on the roof of a square, blue building surmounted by seven poles bearing seven skulls.  This then, thought Bradley, is the Blue Place of Seven Skulls.  Over the opening in the roof was a grated covering, and this the Wieroo removed.  The thing then tied a piece of fiber rope to one of Bradley's ankles and rolled him over the edge of the opening.  All was dark below and for an instant the Englishman came as near to experiencing real terror as he had ever come in his life before.  As he rolled off into the black abyss he felt the rope tighten about his ankle and an instant later he was stopped with a sudden jerk to swing pendulumlike, head downward.  Then the creature lowered away until Bradley's head came in sudden and painful contact with the floor below, after which the Wieroo let loose of the rope entirely and the Englishman's body crashed to the wooden planking.  He felt the free end of the rope dropped upon him and heard the grating being slid into place above him.    Chapter 3  Half-stunned, Bradley lay for a minute as he had fallen and then slowly and painfully wriggled into a less uncomfortable position.  He could see nothing of his surroundings in the gloom about him until after a few minutes his eyes became accustomed to the dark interior when he rolled them from side to side in survey of his prison.  He discovered himself to be in a bare room which was windowless, nor could he see any other opening than that through which he had been lowered.  In one corner was a huddled mass that might have been almost anything from a bundle of rags to a dead body.  Almost immediately after he had taken his bearings Bradley commenced working with his bonds.  He was a man of powerful physique, and as from the first he had been imbued with a belief that the fiber ropes were too weak to hold him, he worked on with a firm conviction that sooner or later they would part to his strainings.  After a matter of five minutes he was positive that the strands about his wrists were beginning to give; but he was compelled to rest then from exhaustion.  As he lay, his eyes rested upon the bundle in the corner, and presently he could have sworn that the thing moved.  With eyes straining through the gloom the man lay watching the grim and sinister thing in the corner.  Perhaps his overwrought nerves were playing a sorry joke upon him.  He thought of this and also that his condition of utter helplessness might still further have stimulated his imagination.  He closed his eyes and sought to relax his muscles and his nerves; but when he looked again, he knew that he had not been mistaken--the thing had moved; now it lay in a slightly altered form and farther from the wall.  It was nearer him.  With renewed strength Bradley strained at his bonds, his fascinated gaze still glued upon the shapeless bundle.  No longer was there any doubt that it moved--he saw it rise in the center several inches and then creep closer to him.  It sank and arose again--a headless, hideous, monstrous thing of menace.  Its very silence rendered it the more terrible.  Bradley was a brave man; ordinarily his nerves were of steel; but to be at the mercy of some unknown and nameless horror, to be unable to defend himself--it was these things that almost unstrung him, for at best he was only human.  To stand in the open, even with the odds all against him; to be able to use his fists, to put up some sort of defense, to inflict punishment upon his adversary--then he could face death with a smile.  It was not death that he feared now--it was that horror of the unknown that is part of the fiber of every son of woman.  Closer and closer came the shapeless mass.  Bradley lay motionless and listened.  What was that he heard!  Breathing?  He could not be mistaken--and then from out of the bundle of rags issued a hollow groan.  Bradley felt his hair rise upon his head.  He struggled with the slowly parting strands that held him.  The thing beside him rose up higher than before and the Englishman could have sworn that he saw a single eye peering at him from among the tumbled cloth.  For a moment the bundle remained motionless--only the sound of breathing issued from it, then there broke from it a maniacal laugh.  Cold sweat stood upon Bradley's brow as he tugged for liberation.  He saw the rags rise higher and higher above him until at last they tumbled upon the floor from the body of a naked man--a thin, a bony, a hideous caricature of man, that mouthed and mummed and, wabbling upon its weak and shaking legs, crumpled to the floor again, still laughing--laughing horribly.  It crawled toward Bradley.  \"Food!  Food!\" it screamed.  \"There is a way out! There is a way out!\""]]]
