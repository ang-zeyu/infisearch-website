If mighty Isis does not lend her aid, the young prince's life will soon be over.\"  Then, turning to the donkey, he dealt him two severe blows on the right and left haunches, shouting: \"Hi, Grey!  It does one good to hear that royal backs have room for the cudgel too.\"  Meanwhile, the Nubian was hesitating whether she should not first turn the donkey to the right and seek Didymus; but Barine was threatened by greater peril, and her life was of more value than the welfare of the aged pair.  This decided the question, and she rode forward.  The donkey and his driver did their best, but they came too late; for in the little palace at Kanopus, Anukis learned from the porter that Archibius had gone to the city with his old friend Timagenes, the historian, who lived in Rome, and seemed to have come to Alexandria as an envoy.  Charmian, too, had been here, but also failed to find the master of the house, and followed him.  Evil tidings-which, owing to the loss of time involved, might prove fatal.  If the donkey had only been swifter!  True, Archibius's stable was full of fine animals, but who was she that she should presume to use them?  Yet she had gained something which rendered her the equal of many who were born free and occupied a higher station-- the reputation for trustworthiness and wisdom; and relying upon this, she told the faithful old steward, as far as possible, what was at stake, and soon after he himself took her, both mounted on swift mules, to the city and the Paneum garden.  He chose the nearest road thither through the Gate of the Sun and the Kanopic Way.  Usually at this hour it was crowded with people, but to-day few persons were astir.  All the idlers had thronged to the Bruchium and the harbour to see the returning ships of the vanquished fleet, hear something new, witness the demonstrations of joy, the sacrifices and processions, and--if Fortune favoured--meet the Queen and relieve their overflowing hearts by acclamations.  When the carriage turned towards the left and approached the Paneum, progress for the first time became difficult.  A dense crowd had gathered around the hill on whose summit the sanctuary of Pan dominated the spacious garden.  Anukis's eye perceived the tall figure of Philostratus. Was the mischief-maker everywhere?  This time he seemed to encounter opposition, for loud shouts interrupted his words.  Just as the carriage passed he pointed to the row of houses in which the widow of Leonax lived, but violent resistance followed the gesture.  Anukis perceived what restrained the crowd; for, as the equipage approached its destination, a body of armed youths stopped it.  Their finely-formed limbs, steeled by the training of the Palaestra, and the raven, chestnut, and golden locks floating around their well-shaped heads, were indeed beautiful.  They were a band of the Ephebi, formerly commanded by Archibius, and to whose leadership more recently Dion had been elected.  The youths had heard what had occurred--that imprisonment, perhaps even worse disaster, threatened him.  At any other time it would scarcely have been possible to oppose the decree of the Government and guard their imperilled friend, but in these dark days the rulers must deal with them.  Though they were loyal to the Queen, and had resolved, spite of her defeat, to support her cause, as soon as she needed them, they would not suffer Dion to be punished for a crime which, in their eyes, was an honour.  Their determination to protect him grew more eager with every vexatious delay on the part of the city council to deal with a matter which concerned one of their own body.  They had not yet decided whether to demand a full pardon or only a mild sentence for the man who had wounded the \"King of kings,\" the son of the sovereign.  Moreover, the quiet Caesarion, still subject to his tutor, had not understood how to win the favour of the Ephebi.  The weakling never appeared in the Palaestra, which even the great Mark Antony did not disdain to visit. The latter had more than once given the youths assembled there proofs of his giant strength, and his son Antyllus also frequently shared their exercises.  Dion had merely dealt Caesarion with his clenched fist one of the blows which every one must encounter in the arena.  Philotas of Amphissa, the pupil of Didymus, had been the first to inform them of the attack and, with fiery zeal, had used his utmost power to atone for the wrong done to his master's granddaughter.  His appeal had roused the most eager sympathy.  The Ephebi believed themselves strong enough to defend their friend against any one and, if the worst should come, they knew they would be sustained by the council, the Exegetus, the captain of the guard--a brave Macedonian, who had once been an ornament of their own band--and the numerous clients of Dion and his family. There was not a single weakling among them.  They had already found an opportunity to prove this; for, though they had arrived too late to protect Didymus's property from injury, they had checked the fury of the mob whose passions Philostratus had aroused, and forced back the crowd whom the Syrian led to Barine's dwelling to devote it to the same fate.  Another equipage was already standing before the door of Berenike's house--one of the carriages which were always at the disposal of the Queen's officials--when Anukis left Archibius's vehicle.  Had some of Alexas's myrmidons arrived, or was he himself on the way to examine Dion, or even arrest him?  The driver, like all the palace servants, knew Anukis, and she learned from him that he had brought Gorgias, the architect.  Anukis had never met the latter, though, during the rebuilding of Caesarion's apartments, she had often seen him, and heard much of him; among other things, that Dion's beautiful palace was his work.  He was a friend of the wounded man, so she need not fear him.  When she entered the atrium she heard that Berenike had gone out to drive with Archibius and his Roman friend.  The leech had forbidden his patient to see many visitors.  No one had been admitted except Gorgias and one of Dion's freedmen.  But time pressed; people of the same rank and disposition understand one another; the old porter and the Nubian were both loyal to their employers, and, moreover, were natives of the same country; so it required only a few words to persuade the door-keeper to conduct her without delay to the bedside of the wounded man.  The freedman, a tall, weather-beaten greybeard, simply clad, who looked like a pilot, was waiting outside the sick-room.  He had not yet been admitted to Dion's presence, but this did not appear to vex him, for he stood leaning quietly against the wall beside the door, gazing at the broad-brimmed sailor's hat which he was slowly turning in his hands.  Scarcely had Dion heard Anukis's name, when an eager \"Let her come in\" reached her ears through the half-open door.  The Nubian waited to be summoned, but her dark face must have showed distinctly that something important and urgent had brought her here, for the wounded man added to his first words of greeting the expression of a fear that she had no good news.  Her reply was an eager nod of assent, accompanied by a doubtful glance at Gorgias; and Dion now curtly told the architect the name of the newcomer, and assured her that his friend might hear everything, even the greatest secret.  Anukis uttered a sigh of relief and then, in a tone of the most earnest warning, poured forth the story of the impending danger.  She would not be satisfied when he spoke of the Ephebi, who were ready to defend him, and the council, which would make the cause of one of its members its own, but entreated him to seek some safe place of refuge, no matter where; for powers against whom no resistance would avail were stretching their hands towards him.  Even this statement, however, proved useless, for Dion was convinced that the influence of his uncle, the Keeper of the Seal, would guard him from any serious danger.  Then Anukis resolved to confess what she had overheard; but she told the story without mentioning Barine, and the peril threatening her also.  Finally, with all the warmth of a really anxious heart, she entreated him to heed her warning.  Even while she was still speaking, the friends exchanged significant glances; but scarcely had the last words fallen from her lips when the giant figure of the freedman passed through the door, which had remained open.  \"You here, Pyrrhus?\" cried the wounded man kindly.  \"Yes, master, it is I,\" replied the stalwart fellow, twirling his sailor hat still faster.  \"Listening isn't exactly my trade, and I don't usually enter your  presence uninvited;  but I couldn't help hearing what came through the door, and the croaking of the old raven drew me in.\"  \"I wish you had heard more cheerful things,\" replied Dion; \"but the brown-skinned bird of ill omen usually sings pleasant songs, and they all come from a faithful heart.  But when my silent Pyrrhus opens his mouth so far, something important must surely follow, and you can speak freely in her presence.\"  The sailor cleared his throat, gripped his coarse felt hat in his sinewy hands, and said, in such a tremulous, embarrassed tone that his heavy chin quivered and his voice sometimes faltered: \"If the woman is to be trusted, you must leave here, master, and seek some safe hiding-place. I came to offer one.  On my way I heard your name.  It was said that you had wounded the Queen's son, and it might cost you your life.  Then I thought: 'No, no, not that, so long as Pyrrhus lives, who taught his young master Dion to use the oars and to set his first sail--Pyrrhus and his family.'  Why repeat what we both know well enough?  From my first boat and the land on our island to the liberty you bestowed upon us, we owe everything to your father and to you, and a blessing has rested upon your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5478"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 06 (#3)"],["body","and our labour, and what is mine is yours.  No more words are needed.  You know our cliff beyond the Alveus Steganus, north of the great harbour--the Isle of Serpents.  It is quickly gained by any one who knows the course through the water, but is as inaccessible to others as the moon and stars.  People are afraid of the mere name, though we rid the island of the vermin long ago.  My boys Dionysus, Dionichus, and Dionikus--they all have 'Dion' in their name--are waiting in the fish market, and when it grows dusk--\"  Here the wounded man interrupted the speaker by holding out his hand and thanking him warmly for his fidelity and kindness, though he refused the well-meant invitation.  He admitted that he knew no safer hiding-place than the cliff surrounded by fluttering sea-gulls, where Pyrrhus lived with his family and earned abundant support by fishing and serving as pilot.  But anxiety concerning his future wife prevented his leaving the city.  The freedman however gave him no rest.  He represented how quickly the harbour could be reached from his island, that fish were brought thence from it daily, and he would therefore always have news of what was passing.  His sons were like him, and never used any unnecessary words; talking did not suit them.  The women of the household rarely left the island.  So long as it sheltered their beloved guest, they should not set foot away from it.  If occasion should require, the master could be in Alexandria again quickly enough to put anything right.  This suggestion pleased the architect, who joined in the conversation to urge the freedman's request.  But Dion, for Barine's sake, obstinately refused, until Anukis, who had long been anxious to go in pursuit of Archibius, thought it time to give her opinion.  \"Go with the man, my lord!\" she cried.  \"I know what I know.  I will tell our Barine of your faithful resolution; but how can she show her gratitude for it if you are a dead man?\"  This question and the information which followed it turned the scale; and, as soon as Dion had consented to accompany the freedman, the Nubian prepared to continue her errands, but the wounded man detained her to give many messages for Barine, and then she was stopped by the architect, who thought he had found in her the right assistant for numerous plans he had in his mind.  He had returned early that morning from Heroonpolis, where, with other members of his profession, he had inspected the newly constructed waterway.  The result of the first investigation had been unfavourable to the verge of discouragement; and, in behalf of the others, he had gone to the Queen to persuade her to give up the enterprise which, though so full of promise, was impracticable in the short time at their disposal.  He had travelled all night, and was received as soon as Cleopatra rose from her couch.  He had driven from the Lochias in the carriage placed at his disposal because he had business at the arsenal and various points where building was going on, in order to inspect the wall erected for Antony on the Choma, and the Temple of Isis at the Corner of the Muses, to which Cleopatra desired to add a new building.  But scarcely had he quitted the Bruchium when he was detained by the crowd assailing the house of Didymus with beams and rams, and at the same time keeping off the Ephebi who had attacked them.  He had forced his way through the raging mob to aid the old couple and their granddaughter.  The slave Phryx had been busily preparing the boats which lay moored in the harbour of the seawashed estate, but Gorgias had found it difficult to persuade the grey-haired philosopher to go with him and his family to the shore.  He was ready to face the enraged rioters and--though it should cost his life--cry out that they were shamefully deceived and were staining themselves with a disgraceful crime.  Not until the architect represented that it was unworthy of a Didymus to expose to bestial violence a life on which helpless women and the whole world--to whom his writings were guide-posts to the realms of truth-- possessed a claim, could he be induced to yield.  Nevertheless, the sage and his relatives almost fell into the hands of the furious rabble, for Didymus would not depart until he had saved this, that, and the other precious book, till the number reached twenty or thirty.  Besides, his old deaf wife, who usually submitted quietly when her defective hearing prevented her comprehension of many things, insisted upon knowing what was occurring.  She ordered everybody who came near her to explain what had happened, thus detaining her granddaughter Helena, who was trying to save the most valuable articles in the dwelling.  So the departure was delayed, and only the brave defence of young Philotas, Didymus's assistant, and some of the Ephebi, who joined him, enabled them to escape unharmed.  The Scythian guards, which at last put a stop to the frantic rage of the deluded populace, arrived too late to prevent the destruction of the house, but they saved Philotas and the other youths from the fists and stones of the rabble.  When the boats had gone farther out into the harbour the question of finding a home for the philosopher and his family was discussed.  Berenike's house was also threatened, and the rules of the museum prevented the reception of women.  Five servants had accompanied the family, and none of Didymus's learned friends had room for so many guests.  When the old man and Helena began to enumerate the lodgings of which they could think, Gorgias interposed with an entreaty that they would come to his house.  He had inherited the dwelling from his father.  It was very large and spacious, almost empty, and they could reach it speedily, as it stood on the seashore, north of the Forum.  The fugitives would be entirely at liberty there, since he had work on hand which would permit him to spend no time under his own roof except at night.  He soon overcame the trivial objections made by the philosopher and, fifteen minutes after they had left the Corner of the Muses, he was permitted to open the door of his house to his guests, and he did so with genuine pleasure.  The old housekeeper and the grey-haired steward, who had been in his father's service, looked surprised, but worked zealously after Gorgias had confided the visitors to their charge.  The pressure of business forbade his fulfilling the duties of host in his own person.  Didymus and his family had reason to be grateful; and when the old sage found in the large library which the architect placed at his disposal many excellent books and among them some of his own, he ceased his restless pacing to and fro and forced himself to settle down.  Then he remembered that, by the advice of a friend, he had placed his property in the keeping of a reliable banker and, though life still seemed dark grey, it no longer looked as black as before.  Gorgias briefly related all this to the Nubian, and Dion added that she would find Archibius with his Roman friend at the house of Berenike's brother, the philosopher Arius.  Like himself, the latter was suffering from an injury inflicted by a reckless trick of Antyllus.  Barine's mother was there also, so Anukis could inform them of the fate of Didymus and his brother, and tell them that he, Dion, intended to leave her house and the city an hour after sunset.  \"But,\" interrupted Gorgias, \"no one, not even your hostess Berenike and her brother, must know your destination.--You look as if you could keep a secret, woman.\"  \"Though she owes her nickname Aisopion to her nimble tongue,\" replied Dion.  \"But this tongue is like the little silver fish with scarlet spots in the palace garden,\" said Anukis.  \"They dart to and fro nimbly enough; but as soon as danger threatens they keep as quiet in the water as though they were nailed fast.  And--by mighty Isis!--we have no lack of peril in these trying times.  Would you like to see the lady Berenike and the others before your departure?\"  \"Berenike, yes; but the sons of Arius--they are fine fellows--would be wise to keep aloof from this house to-day.\"  \"Yes indeed!\" the architect chimed in.  \"It will be prudent for their father, too, to seek some hiding-place.  He is too closely connected with Octavianus.  It may indeed happen that the Queen will desire to make use of him.  In that case he may be able to aid Barine, who is his sister's child.  Timagenes, too, who comes from Rome as a mediator, may have some influence.\"  \"The same thoughts entered my poor brain also,\" said Anukis.  \"I am now going to show the gentlemen the danger which threatens her, and if I succeed--Yet what could a serving-woman of my appearance accomplish? Still--my house is nearer to the brink of the stream than the dwelling of most others, and if I fling in a loaf, perhaps the current will bear it to the majestic sea.\"  \"Wise Aisopion!\" cried Dion; but the worthy maid-servant shrugged her crooked shoulders, saying: \"We needn't be free-born to find pleasure in what is right; and if being wise means using one's brains to think, with the intention of promoting right and justice, you can always call me so. Then you will start after sundown?\"  With these words she was about to leave the room, but the architect, who had watched her every movement, had formed a plan and begged her to follow him.  When they reached the next room he asked for a faithful account of Barine and the dangers threatening her.  After consulting her as if she were an equal, he held out his hand in farewell, saying: \"If it is possible to bring her to the Temple of Isis unseen, these clouds may scatter.  I shall be in the sanctuary of the goddess from the first hour after sunset.  I have some measurements to take there.  When you say you know that the immortals will have pity on the innocent woman whom they have led to the verge of the abyss, perhaps you may be right.  It seems as if matters here were combining in a way which would be apt to rob"]]]
