He could not be mistaken, and as in the face of approaching danger he collected himself and recovered his powers of thought and deliberation, his ear distinctly caught the mighty floods of stirring sound that came over the mountain, from the brazen cymbals struck by the watchmen to warn the inhabitants of the oasis, and the anchorites.  Was Hermas returned?  Had the Blemmyes outstripped him?  From what quarter were the marauding hosts coming on?  Could he venture to remain here near his victim, or was it his duty to use his powerful arms in defence of his helpless companions?  In agonized doubt he looked down at the youth's pallid features, and deep, sorrowful compassion filled his mind.  How promising was this young tree of humanity that his rough fist had broken off! and these brown curls had only yesterday been stroked by a mother's hand.  His eyes filled with tears, and he bent as tenderly as a father might over the pale face, and pressed a gentle kiss on the bloodless lips of the senseless youth.  A thrill of joy shot through him, for Polykarp's lips were indeed not cold, he moved his hand, and now--the Lord be praised!  he actually opened his eyes.  \"And I am not a murderer!\"  A thousand voices seem to sing with joy in his heart, and then he thought to himself, \"First I will carry him down to his parents in the oasis, and then go up to the brethren.\"  But the brazen signals rang out with renewed power, and the stillness of the holy wilderness was broken here by the clatter of men's voices, there by a blast of trumpets, and there again by stifled cries.  It was as if a charm had given life to the rocks and lent their voices; as if noise and clamor were rushing like wild torrents down every gorge and cleft of the mountainside.  \"It is too late,\" sighed the anchorite.  \"If I only could--if I only knew--\"  \"Hallo! hallo! holy Paulus!\"  a shrill woman's voice which seemed to come from high up in the air rang out joyful and triumphant, interrupting the irresolute man's meditations, \"Hermas is alive!  Hermas is here again! Only look up at the heights.  There flies the standard, for he has warned the sentinels.  The Blemmyes are coming on, and he sent me to seek you. You must come to the strong tower on the western side of the ravine. Make haste! come at once!  Do you hear?  He told me to tell you.  But the man in your lap--it is--yes, it is--\"  \"It is your master's son Polykarp,\" Paulus called back to her.  \"He is hurt unto death; hurry down to the oasis, and tell the senator, tell Dame Dorothea--\"  \"I have something else to do now,\" interrupted the shepherdess.  \"Hermas has sent me to warn Gelasius, Psoes, and Dulas, and if I went down into the oasis they would lock me up, and not let me come up the mountain again.  What has happened to the poor fellow?  But it is all the same: there is something else for you to do besides grieving over a hole in Polykarp's head.  Go up to the tower, I tell you, and let him lie--or carry him up with you into your new den, and hand him over to your sweetheart to nurse.\"  \"Demon!\"  exclaimed Paulus, taking up a stone.  \"Let him he!\"  repeated Miriam.  \"I will betray her hiding-place to Phoebicius, if you do not do as Dermas orders you.  Now I am off to call the others, and we shall meet again at the tower.  And you had better not linger too long with your fair companion--pious Paulus--saintly Paulus!\"  And laughing loudly, she sprang away from rock to rock as if borne up by the air.  The Alexandrian looked wrathfully after her; but her advice did not seem to be bad, he lifted the wounded man on his shoulders, and hastily carried him up towards his cave; but before he could reach it he heard steps, and a loud agonized scream, and in a few seconds Sirona was by his side, crying in passionate grief, \"It is he, it is he-and oh, to see him thus!--But he must live, for if he were dead your God of Love would be inexorable, pitiless, hard, cruel--it would be--\"  She could say no more, for tears choked her voice, and Paulus, without listening to her lamentation, passed quickly on in front of her, entered the cave and laid the unconscious man down on the couch, saying gravely but kindly, as Sirona threw herself on her knees and pressed the young man's powerless hand to her lips, \"If indeed you truly love him, cease crying and lamenting.  He yesterday got a severe wound on his head; I have washed it, now do you bind it up with care, and keep it constantly cool with fresh water.  You know your way to the spring; when he recovers his senses rub his feet, and give him some bread and a few drops of the wine which you will find in the little cellar hard by; there is some oil there too, which you will need for a light.  \"I must go up to the brethren, and if I do not return to-morrow, give the poor lad over to his mother to nurse.  Only tell her this, that I, Paulus, gave him this wound in a moment of rage, and to forgive me if she can, she and Petrus.  And you too forgive me that in which I have sinned against you, and if I should fall in the battle which awaits us, pray that the Lord may not be too hard upon me in the day of judgment, for my sins are great and many.\"  At this moment the sound of the trumpets sounded even into the deepest recess of the cave.  Sirona started.  \"That is the Roman tuba,\" she exclaimed.  \"I know the sound--Phoebicius is coming this way.\"  \"He is doing his duty,\" replied Paulus.  \"And still, one thing more.  I saw last night a ring on your hand--an onyx.\"  \"There it lies,\" said Sirona; and she pointed to the farthest corner of the cave, where it lay on the dusty soil.  \"Let it remain there,\" Paulus begged of her;  he bent over the senseless man once more to kiss his forehead, raised his hand towards Sirona in sign of blessing, and rushed out into the open air.     CHAPTER XIX.  Two paths led over the mountain from the oasis to the sea; both followed deep and stony gorges, one of which was named the \"short cut,\" because the traveller reached his destination more quickly by that road than by following the better road in the other ravine, which was practicable for beasts of burden.  Half-way up the height the \"short cut\" opened out on a little plateau, whose western side was shut in by a high mass of rock with steep and precipitous flanks.  At the top of this rock stood a tower built of rough blocks, in which the anchorites were wont to take refuge when they were threatened with a descent of their foes.  The position of this castle--as the penitents proudly styled their tower --was well-chosen, for from its summit they commanded not only the \"short cut\" to the oasis, but also the narrow shell-strewn strip of desert which divided the western declivity of the Holy Mountain from the shore, the blue-green waters of the sea, and the distant chain of hills on the African coast.  Whatever approached the tower, whether from afar or from the neighborhood, was at once espied by them, and the side of the rock which was turned to the roadway was so precipitous and smooth that it remained inaccessible even to the natives of the desert, who, with their naked feet and sinewy arms, could climb points which even the wild goat and the jackal made a circuit to avoid.  It was more accessible from the other side, and in order to secure that, a very strong wall had been built, which enclosed the level on which the castle stood in the form of a horseshoe, of which the ends abutted on the declivity of the short road. This structure was so roughly and inartistically heaped together that it looked as if formed by nature rather than by the hand of man.  The rough and unfinished appearance of this wall-like heap of stones was heightened by the quantity of large and small pieces of granite which were piled on the top of it, and which had been collected by the anchorites, in case of an incursion, to roll and hurl down on the invading robbers.  A cistern had been dug out of the rocky soil of the plateau which the wall enclosed, and care was taken to keep it constantly filled with water.  Such precautions were absolutely necessary, for the anchorites were threatened with dangers from two sides.  First from the Ishmaelite hordes of Saracens who fell upon them from the east, and secondly from the Blemmyes, the wild inhabitants of the desert country which borders the fertile lands of Egypt and Nubia, and particularly of the barren highlands that part the Red Sea from the Nile valley; they crossed the sea in light skiffs, and then poured over the mountain like a swarm of locusts.  The little stores and savings which the defenceless hermits treasured in their caves had tempted the Blemmyes again and again, in spite of the Roman garrison in Pharan, which usually made its appearance on the scene of their incursion long after they had disappeared with their scanty booty.  Not many months since, the raid had been effected in which old Stephanus had been wounded by an arrow, and there was every reason to hope that the wild marauders would not return very soon, for Phoebicius, the commander of the Roman maniple in the oasis, was swift and vigorous in his office, and though he had not succeeded in protecting the anchorites from all damage, he had followed up the Blemmyes, who fled at his approach, and cut them off from rejoining their boats.  A battle took place between the barbarians and the Romans, not far from the coast on the desert tract dividing the hills from the sea, which resulted in the total annihilation of the wild tribes and gave ground to hope that such a lesson might serve as a warning to the sons of the desert.  But if hitherto the more easily quelled promptings of covetousness had led them to cross the sea, they were now animated by the most sacred of all duties, by the law which required them to avenge the blood of their fathers and brothers, and they dared to plan a fresh incursion in which they should put forth all their resources.  They were at the same time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5498"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","to exercise the greatest caution, and collected their forces of young men in the valleys that lay hidden in the long range of coast- hills.  The passage of the narrow arm of the sea that parted them from Arabia Petraea, was to be effected in the first dark night; the sun, this evening, had set behind heavy storm-clouds that had discharged themselves in violent rain and had obscured the light of the waning moon.  So they drew their boats and rafts down to the sea, and, unobserved by the sentinels on the mountain who had taken shelter from the storm under their little penthouses, they would have reached the opposite shore, the mountain, and perhaps even the oasis, if some one had not warned the anchorites--and that some one was Hermas.  Obedient to the commands of Paulus, the lad had appropriated three of his friend's gold pieces, had provided himself with a bow and arrows and some bread, and then, after muttering a farewell to his father who was asleep in his cave, he set out for Raithu.  Happy in the sense of his strength and manhood, proud of the task which had been set him and which he deemed worthy of a future soldier, and cheerfully ready to fulfil it even at the cost of his life, he hastened forward in the bright moonlight.  He quitted the path at the spot where, to render the ascent possible even to the vigorous desert-travellers, it took a zigzag line, and clambered from rock to rock, up and down in a direct line; when he came to a level spot he flew on as if pursuers were at his heels.  After sunrise he refreshed himself with a morsel of food, and then hurried on again, not heeding the heat of noon, nor that of the soft sand in which his foot sank as he followed the line of the sea-coast.  Thus passionately hurrying onwards he thought neither of Sirona nor of his past life--only of the hills on the farther shore and of the Blemmyes--how he should best surprise them, and, when he had learnt their plans, how he might recross the sea and return to his own people.  At last, as he got more and more weary, as the heat of the sun grew more oppressive, and as the blood rushed more painfully to his heart and began to throb more rapidly in his temples, be lost all power of thought, and that which dwelt in his mind was no more than a dumb longing to reach his destination as soon as possible.  It was the third afternoon when he saw from afar the palms of Raithu, and hurried on with revived strength.  Before the sun had set he had informed the anchorite, to whom Paulus had directed him, that the Alexandrian declined their call, and was minded to remain on the Holy Mountain.  Then Hermas proceeded to the little harbor, to bargain with the fishermen of the place for the boat which he needed  While he was talking with an old Amalekite boatman, who, with his black-eyed sons, was arranging his nets, two riders came at a quick pace towards the bay in which a large merchant-ship lay at anchor, surrounded by little barks.  The fisherman pointed to it.  \"It is waiting for the caravan from Petra,\" he said.  \"There, on the dromedary, is the emperor's great warrior who commands the Romans in Pharan.\"  Hermas saw Phoebicius for the first time, and as he rode up towards him and the fisherman he started; if he had followed his first impulse, he would have turned and have taken to flight, but his clear eyes had met the dull and searching glance of the centurion, and, blushing at his own weakness, he stood still with his arms crossed, and proudly and defiantly awaited the Gaul who with his companion came straight up to him.  Talib had previously seen the youth by his father's side; he recognized him and asked how long he had been there, and if he had come direct from the mountain.  Hermas answered him as was becoming, and understood at once that it was not he that the centurion was seeking.  Perfectly reassured and not without curiosity he looked at the new-comer, and a smile curled his lips as he observed that the lean old man, exhausted by his long and hurried ride, could scarcely hold himself on his beast, and at the same time it struck him that this pitiable old man was the husband of the blooming and youthful Sirona.  Far from feeling any remorse for his intrusion into this man's house, he yielded entirely to the audacious humor with which his aspect filled him, and when Phoebicius himself asked him as to whether he had not met on his way with a fair-haired woman and a limping greyhound, he replied, repressing his laughter with difficulty:  \"Aye, indeed!  I did see such a woman and her dog, but I do not think it was lame.\"  \"Where did you see her?\"  asked Phoebicius hastily.  Hermas colored, for he was obliged to tell an untruth, and it might be that he would do Sirona an injury by giving false information.  He therefore ventured to give no decided answer, but enquired, \"Has the woman committed some crime that you are pursuing her?\"  \"A great one!\"  replied Talib, \"she is my lord's wife, and--\"  What she has done wrong concerns me alone,' said Phoebicius, sharply interrupting his companion.  \"I hope this fellow saw better than you who took the crying woman with a child, from Aila, for Sirona.  What is your name, boy?\"  \"Hermas,\" answered the lad.  \"And who are you, pray?\"  The Gaul's lips were parted for an angry reply, but he suppressed it and said, \"I am the emperor's centurion, and I ask you, what did the woman look like whom you saw, and where did you meet her?\"  The soldier's fierce looks, and his captain's words showed Hermas that the fugitive woman had nothing good to expect if she were caught, and as he was not in the least inclined to assist her pursuers he hastily replied, giving the reins to his audacity, \"I at any rate did not meet the person whom you seek; the woman I saw is certainly not this man's wife, for she might very well be his granddaughter.  She had gold hair, and a rosy face, and the greyhound that followed her was called Iambe.\"  \"Where did you meet her?\"  shrieked the centurion.  \"In the fishing-village at the foot of the mountain,\" replied Hermas. \"She got into a boat, and away it went!\"  \"Towards the north?\"  asked the Gaul.  \"I think so,\" replied Hermas, \"but I do not know, for I was in a hurry, and could not look after her.\"  \"Then we will try to take her in Klysma,\" cried Phoebicius to the Amalekite.  \"If only there were horses in this accursed desert!\"  \"It is four days' journey,\" said Talib considering.  \"And beyond Elim there is no water before the Wells of Moses.  Certainly if we could get good dromedaries--\"  \"And if,\" interrupted Hermas, \"it were not better that you, my lord centurion, should not go so far from the oasis.  For over there they say that the Blemmyes are gathering, and I myself am going across as a spy so soon as it is dark.\"  Phoebicius looked down gloomily considering the matter.  The news had reached him too that the sons of the desert were preparing for a new incursion, and he cried to Talib angrily but decidedly, as he turned his back upon Hermas, \"You must ride alone to Klysma, and try to capture her. I cannot and will not neglect my duty for the sake of the wretched woman.\"  Hermas looked after him as he went away, and laughed out loud when he saw him disappear into his inn.  He hired a boat from the old man for his passage across the sea for one of the gold pieces given him by Paulus, and lying down on the nets he refreshed him self by a deep sleep of some hours' duration.  When the moon rose he was roused in obedience to his orders, and helped the boy who accompanied him, and who understood the management of the sails and rudder, to push the boat, which was laid up on the sand, down into the sea.  Soon he was flying over the smooth and glistening waters before a light wind, and he felt as fresh and strong in spirit as a young eagle that has just left the nest, and spreads its mighty wings for the first time.  He could have shouted in his new and delicious sense of freedom, and the boy at the stern shook his head in astonishment when he saw Hermas wield the oars he had entrusted to him, unskilfully it is true, but with mighty strokes.  \"The wind is in our favor,\" he called out to the anchorite as he hauled round the sail with the rope in his hand, \"we shall get on without your working so hard.  You may save your strength.\"  \"There is plenty of it, and I need not be stingy of it,\" answered Hermas, and he bent forward for another powerful stroke.  About half-way he took a rest, and admired the reflection of the moon in the bright mirror of the water, and he could not but think of Petrus' court-yard that had shone in the same silvery light when he had climbed up to Sirona's window.  The image of the fair, whitearmed woman recurred to his mind, and a melancholy longing began to creep over him.  He sighed softly, again and yet again; but as his breast heaved for the third bitter sigh, he remembered the object of his journey and his broken fetters, and with eager arrogance he struck the oar flat on to the water so that it spurted high up, and sprinkled the boat and him with a shower of wet and twinkling diamond drops.  He began to work the oars again, reflecting as he did so, that he had something better to do than to think of a woman.  Indeed, he found it easy to forget Sirona completely, for in the next few days he went through every excitement of a warrior's life.  Scarcely two hours after his start from Raithu he was standing on the soil of another continent, and, after finding a hiding-place for his boat, he slipped off among the hills to watch the movements of the Blemmyes.  The very first day he went up to the valley in which they were gathering; on the second, after being many times seen and pursued, he succeeded in seizing a warrior who had been sent out to reconnoitre, and in carrying him off with him; he bound him, and by heavy threats learned many things from him.  The number of their collected enemies was great, but Hermas had hopes of outstripping them, for "]]]
