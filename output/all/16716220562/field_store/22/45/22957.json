In the passage leading to Paula's cell the man suddenly stood still: some one was approaching up the stairs.--If it should be the black Vekeel, and he should find visitors in the prison at so late an hour!  But no.  Two lamps were borne in front of the new-comers, and by their light the warder recognized John, the new Bishop of Memphis, who had often been here before now to console prisoners.  He had come to-night prompted by his desire to see the condemned Melchite.  Mary's dress and demeanor betrayed at once that she could not belong to any official employed here; and, as soon as he had learnt who she was, he whispered to his companion, an aged deacon who always accompanied him when he visited a female prisoner: \"We find her here!\" And when he had ascertained with whom the child had come hither at so late an hour, he turned again to his colleague and added in a low voice:  \"The wife and daughter of Rufinus!  Just so: I have long had my eye on these Greeks.  In church once or twice every year!--Melchites in disguise!  Allied with this Melchite!  And this is the school in which the Mukaukas' granddaughter is growing up!  An abominable trick! Benjamin judged rightly, as he always did!\"  Then, in a subdued voice, he asked:  \"Shall we take her away with us at once?\"  But, as the deacon made objections, he hastily replied: \"You are right; for the present it is enough that we know where she is to be found.\"  The warder meanwhile had opened Paula's cell; before the bishop went in he spoke a few kind words to the child, asking her whether she did not long to see her mother; and when Mary replied: \"Very often!\"  he stroked her hair with his bony hand and said:  \"So I thought.--You have a pretty name, child, and you, like your mother, will perhaps ere long dedicate your life to the Blessed among women, whose name you bear.\"  And, holding the little girl by the hand, he entered the cell.  While Paula looked in amazement at the prelate who came so late a visitor, Joanna and Pulcheria recognized him as the brave ecclesiastic who had so valiantly opposed the old sage and the misled populace, and they bowed with deep reverence.  This the bishop observed, and came to the conclusion that these Greeks perhaps after all belonged to his Church.  At any rate, the child might safely be left in their care a few days longer.  After he had exchanged a few cordial words with them the widow prepared to withdraw, and was about to take leave when he went up to her and announced that he would pay her a visit the next day or the day after; that he wished to speak with her of matters involving the happiness of one who was dear to them both, and Dame Joanna, believing that he referred to Paula, whispered:  \"She has no idea as yet of the terrible fate the people have in store for her.  If possible, spare her the fearful truth before she sleeps this night.\"  \"If possible,\" repeated the prelate.  Then, as Mary kissed his hand before leaving, he drew her to him and said: \"Like the Infant Christ, every Christian child is the Mother's.  You, Mary, are chosen before thousands!  The Lord took your father to himself as a martyr; your mother has dedicated herself to Heaven.  Your road is marked out for you, child, reflect on this.  To-morrow-no, the day after, I will see you and guide you in the new path.\"  At these words Joanna turned pale.  She now understood what the bishop's purpose was in calling on her.  At the bottom of the stairs, she threw her arms round the child and asked her in--a low voice: \"Do you pine for the cloister--do you wish to go away from us like your mother, to think of nothing but saving your soul, to live a nun in the holy seclusion which Pulcheria has described to you so often?\"  But this the child positively denied; and as Joanna's head drooped anxiously and sadly, Mary looked up brightly and exclaimed: \"Never fear, Mother dear!  Things will have altered greatly by the day after tomorrow. Let the bishop come!  I shall be a match for him!--Oh! you do not know me yet.  I have been like a lamb among you through all this misfortune and serious trouble; but there is something more in me than that.  You will be quite astonished!\"  \"Nay, nay.  Remain what you are,\" the widow said.  \"Always and ever full of love for you and Pul.  But I am a grand and trusted person now!  I have something very important to do for Orion to-morrow.  Something--Rustem will go with me.--Important, very important, Mother Joanna.  But what it is I must not tell--not even you!\"  Here she was interrupted, for the heavy prison door opened for their exit.  It was many hours before it was again unlocked to let out the bishop, so long was he detained talking to Paula in her cell.  To his enquiry as to whether she was an orthodox Greek, or as the common people called it, a Melchite, she replied that she was the latter; adding that, if he had come with a view to perverting her from the confession of her forefathers, his visit was thrown away; at the same time she reverenced him as a Christian and a priest; as a learned man, and the friend whom her deceased uncle had esteemed above every other minister of his confession; she was gladly ready to disclose to him all that lay on her soul in the face of death.  He looked into the pure, calm face; and though, at her first declaration, he had felt prompted to threaten her with the hideous end which he had but just done his utmost to avert, he now remembered the Greek widow's request and bound himself to keep silence.  He allowed her to talk till midnight, giving him the whole history of all she had known of joy and sorrow in the course of her young life; his keen insight searched her soul, his pious heart rose to meet the strength and courage of hers; and when he quitted her, as he walked home with the deacon, the first words with which he broke a long silence were:  \"While you were asleep, God vouchsafed me an edifying hour through that heretic child of earth.\"      CHAPTER XX.  When the door in the tall prison-wall was closed behind the women, Joanna made her way through streets still sultry under the silence of the night, Rustem following with the child.  The giant's good heart was devoted to Mary, and he often passed his huge hand over his eyes while she told him all that the scene they had witnessed meant, and the fearful end that threatened Paula.  He broke in now and again, giving utterance to his grief and wrath in strange, natural sounds; for he looked up to his beautiful sick nurse as to a superior being, and Mandane, too, had often remarked that they could never forget all that the noble maiden had done for them.  \"If only,\" Rustem cried at length, clenching his powerful fist, \"If only I could--they should see.  .  .  .\"  and the child looked up with shrewd, imploring eyes, exclaiming eagerly:  \"But you could, Rustem, you could!\"  \"I?\"  asked Rustem in surprise, and he shook his head doubtfully.  \"Yes, you, Rustem; you of all men.  We were talking over something in the prison, and if only you were ready and willing to help us in the matter.\"  \"Willing!\"  laughed the worthy fellow striking his heart; and he went on in his strangely-broken Greek, which was, however, quite intelligible: \"I would give hair and skin for the noble lady.  You have only to speak out.\"  The child clung to the big man with both hands and drew him to her saying: \"We knew you had a grate ful heart.  But you see.  .  .\"  and she interrupted herself to ask in an altered voice:  \"Do you believe in a God?  or stay--do you know what a sacred oath is? Can you swear solemnly?  Yes, yes.  .  .\"  and drawing herself up as tall as possible she went on very seriously: \"Swear by your bride Mandane--as truly as you believe that she loves you.  .  .\"  \"But, sweet soul....\"  \"Swear that you will never betray to a living soul what I am going to say--not even to Mother Joanna and Pulcheria; no, nor even to your Mandane, unless you find you cannot help it and she gives her sacred word....\"  \"What is it?  You quite frighten me!  What am I to swear?\"  \"Not to reveal what I am now going to tell you.\"  \"Yes, yes, little Mistress; I can promise you that.\"  Mary sighed, a long-drawn \"Ah ...!\"  and told him that a trustworthy messenger must be found to go forth to meet Amru, so as to be in time to save Paula.  Then came the question whether he knew the road over the hills from Babylon to the ancient town of Berenice; and when he replied that he had lately travelled that way, and that it was the shortest road to the sea for Djidda and Medina, she repeated her satisfied \"Ah!\"  took his hand, and went on with coaxing but emphatic entreaty while she played with his big fingers: \"And now, best and kindest Rustem, in all Memphis there is but one really trusty messenger; but he, you see, is betrothed, and so he would rather get married and go home with his bride than help us to save the life of poor Paula.\"  \"The cur!\"  growled the Persian.  At this Mary laughed out: \"Yes, the cur!\"  and went on gaily: \"But you are abusing yourself, you stupid Rustem.  You, you are the messenger I mean, the only faithful and trustworthy one far or near.  You, you must meet the governor....\"  \"I!\"  said the man, and he stood still with amazement; but Mary pulled him onward, saying: \"But come on, or the others will notice something.-- Yes, you, you must....\"  \"But child, child,\" interrupted Rustem lamentably,  \"I must go back to my master; and you see, common right and justice....\"  \"You do not choose to leave your sweetheart; not even if the kind creature who watched over you day and night should die for it--die the most cruel and horrible death!  You were ready enough to call that other, as you supposed, a cur--that other whom no one nursed till he was well again; but as for yourself.  .  .  .\"  \"Have patience then!  Hear me, little Mistress!\"  Rustem"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5527"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 11 (#7)"],["body","in again, and pulled away his hand.  \"I am quite willing to wait and Mandane must just submit.  But one man is not good for all tasks.  To ride, or guide a train of merchandise, to keep the cameldrivers in order, to pitch a camp- --all that I can do; but to parley with grand folks, to go straight up to such a man as the great chief Amru with prayers and supplications--all that, you see, sweetheart--even if it were to save my own father, that would be....\"  \"But who asks you to do all that?\"  said the child.  \"You may stand as mute as a fish: it will be your companion's business to do the talking.\"  \"There is to be another one then?  But, great Masdak!  I hope that will be enough at any rate!\"  \"Why will you constantly interrupt me?\"  the little girl put in.  \"Listen first and raise objections after wards.  The second messenger--now open your ears wide--it is I, I myself;--but if you stand still again, you will really betray me.  The long and short of it is, that as surely as I mean to save Paula, I mean to go forth to meet Amru, and if you refuse to go with me I will set out alone and try whether Gibbus the hunchback....\"  Rustem had needed some time to collect his senses after this stupendous surprise, but now he exclaimed: \"You--you--to Berenice, and  over the mountains.  .  .  .\"  \"Yes, over the mountains,\" she repeated, \"and if need be, through the clouds.\"  \"But such a thing was never heard of, never heard of on this earth!\"  the Persian remonstrated.  \"A girl, a little lady like you--a messenger, and all alone with a clumsy fellow like me.  No, no, no!\"  \"And again no, and a hundred times over no!\"  cried the child merrily. \"The little lady will stop at home and you will take a boy with you--a boy called Marius, not Mary.\"  \"A boy!  But I thought.--It is enough to puzzle one....\"  \"A boy who is a girl and a boy in one,\" laughed Mary.  \"But if you must have it in plain words: I shall dress up as a boy to go with you; to-morrow when we set out you will see, you will take me for my own brother.\"  \"Your own brother!  With a little face like yours!  Then the most impossible things will become possible,\" cried Rustem laughing, and he looked down good humoredly at the little girl.  But suddenly the preposterousness of her scheme rose again before his mind, and he exclaimed half-frantically: \"But then my master!--It will not do--It will never do!\"  \"It is for his sake that you will do us this service,\" said Mary confidently.  \"He is Paula's friend and protector; and when he hears what you have done for her he will praise you, while if you leave us in the lurch I am quite sure.  .  .  \"  \"Well?\"  \"That he will say: 'I  thought  Rustem was a shrewder man and had a better heart.'\"  \"You really think he will say that?\"  \"As surely as our house stands before us!--Well, we have no time for any more discussion, so it is settled: we start together.  Let me find you in the garden early to-morrow morning.  You must tell your Mandane that you are called away by important business.\"  \"And Dame Joanna?\"  asked the Persian, and his voice was grave and anxious as he went on: \"The thing I like least, child, is that you should not ask her, and take her into your confidence.\"  \"But she will hear all about it, only not immediately,\" replied Mary. \"And the day after to-morrow, when she knows what I have gone off for and that you are with me, she will praise us and bless us; yes, she will, as surely as I hope that the Almighty will succor us in our journey!\"  At these words, which evidently came from the very depths of her heart, the Masdakite's resistance altogether gave way--just in time, for their walk was at an end, and they both felt as though the long distance had been covered by quite a few steps.  They had passed close to several groups of noisy and quarrelsome citizens, and many a funeral train had borne the plague-stricken dead to the grave by torchlight under their very eyes, but they had heeded none of these things.  It was not till they reached the garden-gate that they observed what was going on around them.  There they found the gardener and all the household, anxiously watching for the return of their belated mistress. Eudoxia too was waiting for them with some alarm.  In the house they were met by Horapollo, but Joanna and Pulcheria returned his greeting with a cold bow, while Mary purposely turned her back on him.  The old man shrugged his shoulders with regretful annoyance, and in the solitude of his own room he muttered to himself:  \"Oh, that woman!  She will be the ruin even of the peaceful days I hoped to enjoy during the short remainder of my life!\"  The widow and her daughter for some time sat talking of Mary.  She had bid them good-night as devotedly and tenderly as though they were parting for life.  Poor child!  She had forebodings of the terrible fate to which the bishop, and perhaps her own mother had predestined her.  But Mary did not look as if she were going to meet misfortune; Eudoxia, who slept by her side, was rejoiced on the contrary at seeing her so gay; only she was surprised to see the child, who usually fell asleep as soon as her little head was on the pillow, lying awake so long this evening. The elderly Greek, who suffered from a variety of little ailments and always went to sleep late, could not help watching the little girl's movements.  What was that?  Between midnight and dawn Mary sprang from her bed, threw on her clothes, and stole into the next room with the night-lamp in her hand.  Presently a brighter light shone through the door-way.  She must have lighted a lamp,-and presently, hearing the door of the sitting-room opened, Eudoxia rose and noiselessly watched her.  Mary immediately returned, carrying a boy's clothes--a suit, in point of fact, which Pulcheria and Eudoxia had lately been making as a Sunday garb--for the lame gardener's boy.  The child smilingly tried on the little blue tunic; then, after tossing the clothes into a chest, she sat down at the table to write.  But she seemed to have set herself some hard task; for now she looked down at the papyrus and rubbed her forehead, and now she gazed thoughtfully into vacancy.  She had written a few sentences when she started up, called Eudoxia by name, and went towards the sleeping-room.  Eudoxia went forward to meet her; Mary threw herself into her arms, and before her governess could ask any questions she told her that she had been chosen to accomplish a great and important action.  She had been intending to wake her, to make her her confidant and to ask her advice.  How sweet and genuine it all sounded, and how charmingly confused she seemed in spite of the ardent zeal that inspired her!  Eudoxia's heart went forth to her; the words of reproof died on her lips, and for the first time she felt as though the orphaned child were her own; as though their joy and grief were one; as though she, who all her life long had thought only of herself and her own advantage, and who had regarded her care of Mary as a mere return in kind for a salary and home, were ready and willing to sacrifice herself and her last coin for this child.  So, when the little girl now threw her arms round Eudoxia's neck, imploring her not to betray her, but, on the contrary, to help her in the good work which aimed at nothing less than the rescue of Paula and Orion- the imperilled victims of Fate, her dry eyes sparkled through tears; she kissed Mary's burning cheeks once more and called her her own dear, dear little daughter.  This gave the child courage; with tragical dignity, which brought a smile to the governess' lips, she took Eudoxia's bible from the desk, and said, fixing her beseeching gaze on the Greek's face:  \"Swear!--nay, you must be quite  grave,  for nothing can be more solemn-- swear not to tell a soul, not even Mother Joanna, what I want to confess to you.\"  Eudoxia promised, but she would take no oath.  \"Yea, yea, and nay, nay,\" was the oath of the Christian by the law of the Lord; but Mary clung to her, stroked her thin cheeks, and at last declared she could not say a word unless Eudoxia yielded.  In such an hour the Greek could not resist this tender coaxing; she allowed Mary to take possession of her hand and lay it on the Bible; and when once this was done Eudoxia gave way, and with much head shaking repeated the oath that her pupil dictated, though much against her will.  After this the governess threw herself on the divan, as if exhausted and shocked at her own weakness; and the little girl took advantage of her victory, seating herself at her feet, and telling her all she knew about Paula and the perils that threatened her and Orion; and she was artful enough to give special prominence to Orion's danger, having long since observed how high he stood in Eudoxia's good graces.  So far Eudoxia had not ceased stroking her hair, while she assented to everything that was said; but when she heard that Mary proposed to undertake the embassy to Amru herself, she started to her feet in horror, and declared most positively that she would never, never consent to such rashness, to such fatal folly.  Mary now brought to bear her utmost resources of persuasion and flattery. There was no other fit messenger to be found, and the lives of Orion and Paula were at stake.  Was a ride across the mountains such a tremendous matter after all?  How well she knew how to manage a beast, and how little she suffered from the heat!  Had she not ridden more than once from Memphis to their estates by the seaboard?  And faithful Rustem would be always with her, and the road over the mountains was the safest in all the country, with frequent stations for the accommodation of travellers. Then, if they found Amru, she could give a more complete report than any other living soul.  But Eudoxia was not to be shaken; though she admitted that Mary's project was not so entirely crazy as it had at first appeared.  At this the little girl began again; after reminding Eudoxia"]]]
