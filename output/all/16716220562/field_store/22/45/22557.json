I am young and strong, and I am sure I can find some other way of earning a dollar a week.\"  \"At any rate, we will hope so, Luke.\"  Luke went to bed early that night. The next morning, as they were sitting at breakfast, Melinda Sprague rushed into the house and sank into a chair, out of breath.  \"Have you heard the news?\"  \"No. What is it?\"  \"The bank has been robbed! A box of United States bonds has been taken, amounting to thirty or forty thousand dollars!\"  Luke and his mother listened in amazement.    CHAPTER X  MELINDA MAKES MISCHIEF   \"Where did you hear this, Melinda?\" asked Mrs. Larkin.  \"I called on Mrs. Duncan just now--I was doing some work for her--and she told me. Isn't it awful?\"  \"Was the bank broken open last night, Miss Sprague?\" asked Luke.  \"I don't know when it was entered.\"  \"I don't understand it at all,\" said Luke, looking puzzled.  \"All I know is that, on examining the safe, the box of bonds was missing.\"  \"Then it might have been taken some time since?\"  \"Yes, it might.\"  The same thought came to Luke and his mother at once. Was the mysterious stranger the thief, and had he robbed the bank and transferred the tin box to Luke? It might be so, but, as this happened more than a fortnight since, it would have been strange in that case that the box had not been missed sooner at the bank. Luke longed to have Miss Sprague go, that he might confer with his mother on this subject. He had been told to keep the possession of the box secret, and therefore he didn't wish to reveal the fact that he had it unless it should prove to be necessary.  \"Were any traces of the robber discovered?\" he added.  \"Not that I heard of; but I pity the thief, whoever he is,\" remarked Melinda. \"When he's found out he will go to jail, without any doubt.\"  \"I can't understand, for my part, how an outside party could open the safe,\" said Mrs. Larkin. \"It seems very mysterious.\"  \"There's many things we can't understand,\" said Melinda, shaking her head sagely. \"All crimes are mysterious.\"  \"I hope they'll find out who took the bonds,\" said the widow. \"Did they belong to the bank?\"  \"No, they belonged to a gentleman in Cavendish, who kept them in the bank, thinking they would be safer than in his own house. Little did he know what iniquity there was even in quiet country places like Groveton.\"  \"Surely, Melinda, you don't think any one in Groveton robbed the bank?\" said Mrs. Larkin.  \"There's no knowing!\" said Miss Sprague, solemnly. \"There's those that we know well, or think we do, but we cannot read their hearts and their secret ways.\"  \"Have you any suspicions, Miss Sprague?\" asked Luke, considerably amused at the portentous solemnity of the visitor.  \"I may and I may not, Luke,\" answered Melinda, with the air of one who knew a great deal more than she chose to tell; \"but it isn't proper for me to speak at present.\"  Just then Miss Sprague saw some one passing who, she thought, had not heard of the robbery, and, hastily excusing herself, she left the house.  \"What do you think, Luke?\" asked his mother, after the spinster had gone. \"Do you think the box we have was taken from the bank?\"  \"No, I don't, mother. I did think it possible at first, but it seems very foolish for the thief, if he was one, to leave the box in the same village, in the charge of a boy. It would have been more natural and sensible for him to open it, take out the bonds, and throw it away or leave it in the woods.\"  \"There is something in that,\" said Mrs. Larkin, thoughtfully. \"There is certainly a mystery about our box, but I can't think it was stolen from the bank.\"  Meanwhile, Miss Sprague had formed an important resolve. The more she thought of it, the more she believed the missing box was the one of which she had caught a glimpse of in Mrs. Larkin's trunk. True, Luke and the widow had not betrayed that confusion and embarrassment which might have been anticipated when the theft was announced, but she had noticed the look exchanged between them, and she was sure it meant something. Above all, her curiosity was aroused to learn how it happened that a woman as poor as the Widow Larkin should have a tin box in her trunk, the contents of which might be presumed to be valuable.  \"I don't like to get Luke and his mother into trouble,\" Melinda said to herself, \"but I think it my duty to tell all I know. At any rate, they will have to tell how the box came into their possession, and what it contains. I'll go to the bank and speak to Squire Duncan.\"  Prince Duncan had called an extra meeting of the directors to consider the loss which had been discovered, and they were now seated in the bank parlor. There were three of them present, all of whom resided in Groveton--Mr. Manning, the hotelkeeper; Mr. Bailey, a storekeeper, and Mr. Beane, the Groveton lawyer.  Miss Sprague entered the bank and went up to the little window presided over by the paying-teller.  \"Is Squire Duncan in the bank?\" she asked.  \"Yes, Miss Sprague.\"  \"I would like to speak with him.\"  \"That is impossible. He is presiding at a directors' meeting.\"  \"Still, I would like to see him,\" persisted Melinda.  \"You will have to wait,\" said the paying-teller, coldly. He had no particular respect or regard for Miss Sprague, being quite familiar with her general reputation as a gossip and busybody.  \"I think he would like to see me,\" said Melinda, nodding her head with mysterious significance. \"There has been a robbery at the bank, hasn't there?\"  \"Do you know anything about it, Miss Sprague?\" demanded the teller, in surprise.  \"Maybe I do, and maybe I don't; but I've got a secret to tell to Squire Duncan.\"  \"I don't believe it amounts to anything,\" thought the teller. \"Well, I will speak to Squire Duncan,\" he said aloud.  He went to the door of the directors' room, and after a brief conference with Prince Duncan he returned with the message, \"You may go in, Miss Sprague.\"  She nodded triumphantly, and with an air of conscious importance walked to the bank parlor.  Prince Duncan and his associates were sitting round a mahogany table.  Melinda made a formal curtsy and stood facing them.  \"I understand, Miss Sprague, that you have something to communicate to us in reference to the loss the bank has just sustained,\" said the squire, clearing his throat.  \"I thought it my duty to come and tell you all I knew, Squire Duncan and gentlemen,\" said Melinda.  \"Quite right, Miss Sprague. Now, what can you tell us?\"  \"The article lost was a tin box, was it not?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"About so long?\" continued Miss Sprague, indicating a length of about fifteen inches.  \"Yes.\"  \"What was there in it?\"  \"Government bonds.\"  \"I know where there is such a box,\" said Miss Sprague, slowly.  \"Where? Please be expeditious, Miss Sprague.\"  \"A few days since I was calling on Mrs. Larkin--Luke's mother--just happened in, as I may say, and, not finding her downstairs, went up into her chamber. I don't think she heard me, for when I entered the chamber and spoke to her she seemed quite flustered. She was on her knees before an open trunk, and in that trunk I saw the tin box.\"  The directors looked at each other in surprise, and Squire Duncan looked undeniably puzzled.  \"I knew the box was one such as is used to hold valuable papers and bonds,\" proceeded Melinda, \"and, as I had always looked on the widow as very poor, I didn't know what to make of it.\"  \"Did you question Mrs. Larkin about the tin box?\" asked Mr. Beane.  \"No; she shut the trunk at once, and I concluded she didn't want me to see it.\"  \"Then you did not say anything about it?\"  \"No; but I went in just now to tell her about the bank being robbed.\"  \"How did it seem to affect her?\" asked Mr. Bailey.  \"She and Luke--Luke was there, too--looked at each other in dismay. It was evident that they were thinking of the box in the trunk.\"  Melinda continued her story, and the directors were somewhat impressed.  \"I propose,\" said Mr. Manning, \"that we get out a search-warrant and search Mrs. Larkin's cottage. That box may be the one missing from the bank.\"    CHAPTER XI  LUKE IS ARRESTED   Just after twelve o'clock, when Luke was at home eating dinner, a knock was heard at the front door.  \"I'll go, mother,\" said Luke, and he rose from the table, and, going into the entry, opened the outer door.  His surprise may be imagined when he confronted Squire Duncan and the gentlemen already mentioned as directors of the Groveton bank.  \"Did you wish to see mother?\" he asked.  \"Yes; we have come on important business,\" said Squire Duncan, pompously.  \"Walk in, if you please.\"  Luke led the way into the little sitting-room, followed by the visitors. The dinner-table was spread in the kitchen adjoining. The room looked very much filled up with the unwonted company, all being large men.  \"Mother,\" called Luke, \"here are some gentlemen who wish to see you.\"  The widow entered the room, and looked with surprise from one to another. All waited for Squire Duncan, as the proper person, from his official position, to introduce the subject of their visit.  \"Mrs. Larkin,\" said the squire, pompously, \"it has possibly come to your ears that the Groveton Bank, of which you are aware that I am the president, has been robbed of a box of bonds?\"  \"Yes, sir. I was so informed by Miss Melinda Sprague this morning.\"  \"I am also informed that you have in your custody a tin box similar to the one that has been taken.\"  He expected to see Mrs. Larkin show signs of confusion, but she answered calmly: "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5417"],["title","Struggling Upward, or Luke Larkin's Luck (#7)"],["body","\"I have a box in my custody, but whether it resembles the one lost I can't say.\"  \"Ha! you admit that you hold such a box?\" said the squire, looking significantly at his companions.  \"Certainly. Why should I not?\"  \"Are you willing to show it to us?\"  \"Yes, we are willing to show it,\" said Luke, taking it upon himself to answer, \"but I have no idea that it will do you any good.\"  \"That is for us to decide, young man,\" said Squire Duncan.  \"Do you suppose it is the box missing from the bank, sir?\"  \"It may be.\"  \"When did you miss the box?\"  \"Only this morning, but it may have been taken a month ago.\"  \"This box has been in our possession for a fortnight.\"  \"Such is your statement, Luke.\"  \"It is the truth,\" said Luke, flushing with indignation.  \"My boy,\" said Mr. Beane, \"don't be angry. I, for one, have no suspicion that you have done anything wrong, but it is our duty to inquire into this matter.\"  \"Who told you that we had such a box, Mr. Beane?\"  \"Miss Melinda Sprague was the informant.\"  \"I thought so, mother,\" said Luke. \"She is a prying old maid, and it is just like her.\"  \"Miss Sprague only did her duty,\" said the squire. \"But we are losing time. We require you to produce the box.\"  \"I will get it, gentlemen,\" said the widow, calmly.  While she was upstairs, Mr. Manning inquired: \"Where did you get the box, Luke?\"  \"If you identify it as the box taken from the bank,\" answered Luke, \"I will tell you. Otherwise I should prefer to say nothing, for it is a secret of another person.\"  \"Matters look very suspicious, in my opinion, gentlemen,\" said Squire Duncan, turning to his associates.  \"Not necessarily,\" said Mr. Beane, who seemed inclined to favor our hero. \"Luke may have a good reason for holding his tongue.\"  Here Mrs. Larkin presented herself with the missing box. Instantly it became an object of attention.  \"It looks like the missing box,\" said the squire.  \"Of course, I can offer no opinion,\" said Mr. Beane, \"not having seen the one lost. Such boxes, however, have a general resemblance to each other.\"  \"Have you the key that opens it?\" asked the squire.  \"No, sir.\"  \"Squire Duncan,\" asked Mr. Beane, \"have you the key unlocking the missing box?\"  \"No, sir,\" answered Squire Duncan, after a slight pause.  \"Then I don't think we can decide as to the identity of the two boxes.\"  The trustees looked at each other in a state of indecision. No one knew what ought to be done.  \"What course do you think we ought to take, Squire Duncan?\" asked Mr. Bailey.  \"I think,\" said the bank president, straightening up, \"that there is sufficient evidence to justify the arrest of this boy Luke.\"  \"I have done nothing wrong, sir,\" said Luke, indignantly. \"I am no more of a thief than you are.\"  \"Do you mean to insult me, you young jackanapes?\" demanded Mr. Duncan, with an angry flush on his face.  \"I intend to insult no one, but I claim that I have done nothing wrong.\"  \"That is what all criminals say,\" sneered the squire.  Luke was about to make an angry reply, but Mr. Beane, waving his hand as a signal for our hero to be quiet, remarked calmly: \"I think, Duncan, in justice to Luke, we ought to hear his story as to how the box came into his possession.\"  \"That is my opinion,\" said Mr. Bailey. \"I don't believe Luke is a bad boy.\"  Prince Duncan felt obliged to listen to that suggestion, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Beane being men of consideration in the village.  \"Young man,\" he said, \"we are ready to hear your story. From whom did you receive this box?\"  \"From a man named Roland Reed,\" answered Luke.  The four visitors looked at each other in surprise.  \"And who is Roland Reed?\" asked the president of the bank. \"It seems very much like a fictitious name.\"  \"It may be, for aught I know,\" said Luke, \"but it is the name given me by the person who gave me the box to keep for him.\"  \"State the circumstances,\" said Mr. Beane.  \"About two weeks since I was returning from the house of Miss Almira Clark, where I had gone on an errand for my mother. To shorten my journey, I took my way through the woods. I had nearly passed through to the other side, when a tall man, dark-complexioned, whom I had never seen before stepped up to me. He asked me my name, and, upon my telling him, asked if I would do him a favor. This was to take charge of a tin box, which he carried under his arm.\"  \"The one before us?\" asked Mr. Manning.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Did he give any reason for making this request?\"  \"He said he was about to leave the neighborhood, and wished it taken care of. He asked me to put it under lock and key.\"  \"Did he state why he selected you for this trust?\" asked Mr. Beane.  \"No, sir; he paid me for my trouble, however. He gave me a bank-note, which, when I reached home, I found to be a ten-dollar bill.\"  \"And you haven't seen him since?\"  \"Once only.\"  \"When was that?\"  \"On the evening of Florence Grant's party. On my way home the same man came up to me and asked if the box was safe. I answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'That is all--for the present,' and disappeared. I have not seen him since.\"  \"That is a very pretty romance,\" said Prince Duncan, with a sneer.  \"I can confirm it,\" said Mrs. Larkin, calmly. \"I saw Luke bring in the box, and at his request I took charge of it. The story he told at that time is the same that he tells now.\"  \"Very possibly,\" said the bank president. \"It was all cut and dried.\"  \"You seem very much prejudiced against Luke,\" said Mrs. Larkin, indignantly.  \"By no means, Mrs. Larkin. I judge him and his story from the standpoint of common sense. Gentlemen, I presume this story makes the same impression on you as on me?\"  Mr. Beane shook his head. \"It may be true; it is not impossible,\" he said.  \"You believe, then, there is such a man as Roland Reed?\"  \"There may be a man who calls himself such.\"  \"If there is such a man, he is a thief.\"  \"It may be so, but that does not necessarily implicate Luke.\"  \"He would be a receiver of stolen property.\"  \"Not knowing it to be such.\"  \"At all events, I feel amply justified in causing the arrest of Luke Larkin on his own statement.\"  \"Surely you don't mean this?\" exclaimed Mrs. Larkin, in dismay.  \"Don't be alarmed, mother,\" said Luke, calmly. \"I am innocent of wrong, and no harm will befall me.\"    CHAPTER XII  LUKE AS A PRISONER   Prince Duncan, who was a magistrate, directed the arrest of Luke on a charge of robbing the Groveton Bank. The constable who was called upon to make the arrest performed the duty unwillingly.  \"I don't believe a word of it, Luke,\" he said. \"It's perfect nonsense to say you have robbed the bank. I'd as soon believe myself guilty.\"  Luke was not taken to the lock-up, but was put in the personal custody of Constable Perkins, who undertook to be responsible for his appearance at the trial.  \"You mustn't run away, or you'll get me into trouble, Luke,\" said the good-natured constable.  \"It's the last thing I'd be willing to do, Mr. Perkins,\" said Luke, promptly. \"Then everybody would decide that I was guilty. I am innocent, and want a chance to prove it.\"  What was to be done with the tin box, was the next question.  \"I will take it over to my house,\" said Squire Duncan.  \"I object,\" said Mr. Beane.  \"Do you doubt my integrity?\" demanded the bank president, angrily.  \"No; but it is obviously improper that any one of us should take charge of the box before it has been opened and its contents examined. We are not even certain that it is the one missing from the bank.\"  As Mr. Beane was a lawyer, Prince Duncan, though unwillingly, was obliged to yield. The box, therefore, was taken to the bank and locked up in the safe till wanted.  It is hardly necessary to say that the events at the cottage of Mrs. Larkin, and Luke's arrest, made a great sensation in the village. The charge that Luke had robbed the bank was received not only with surprise, but with incredulity. The boy was so well and so favorably known in Groveton that few could be found to credit the charge. There were exceptions, however. Melinda Sprague enjoyed the sudden celebrity she had achieved as the original discoverer of the thief who had plundered the bank. She was inclined to believe that Luke was guilty, because it enhanced her own importance.  \"Most people call Luke a good boy,\" she said, \"but there was always something about him that made me suspicious. There was something in his expression--I can't tell you what--that set me to thinkin' all wasn't right. Appearances are deceitful, as our old minister used to say.\"  \"They certainly are, if Luke is a bad boy and a thief,\" retorted the other, indignantly. \"You might be in better business, Melinda, than trying to take away the character of a boy like Luke.\"  \"I only did my duty,\" answered Melinda, with an air of superior virtue. \"I had no right to keep secret what I knew about the robbery.\"  \"You always claimed to be a friend of the Larkins. Only last week you took tea there.\"  \"That's true. I am a friend now, but I can't consent to cover up inquiry. Do you know whether the bank has offered any reward for the detection of the thief?\"  \"No,\" said the other, shortly, with a look of contempt at the eager spinster. \"Even if it did, and poor Luke were found guilty, it would be blood-money that no decent person would accept.\"  \"Really, Mrs. Clark, you have singular ideas,\" said the discomfited Melinda. \"I ain't after no money. I only mean to do my duty, but if the bank should recognize the value of my services, it would be only right and proper.\"  There was another who heard with great satisfaction of Luke's arrest. This was Randolph Duncan. As it happened, he was late in learning that his rival had got into trouble, not having seen his father since breakfast.  \"This is great news about Luke,\" said his friend Sam Noble, meeting him on the street.  \"What news? I have heard nothing,\" said Randolph, eagerly.  \"He has been arrested.\"  \"You don't say so!\" exclaimed Randolph. \"What has he done?\"  \"Robbed the bank of a tin box full of bonds. It was worth an"]]]
