In saying this I refer to the campaigns in general; as to your own share in them, I can only say that if no fame is to be won there, you will be putting your own life and the happiness of your family in jeopardy literally for nothing, and that if, on the other hand, you should distinguish yourself again, it would only be giving fresh cause of jealousy and anger to your brother.  No, go to Persia, as soon as you can.\"  Bartja was just beginning to make various objections to these arguments, when he caught sight of Prexaspes coming up to them, looking very pale.  After the usual greeting, the envoy whispered to Bartja, that he should like to speak with him alone.  Rhodopis left them at once, and he began, playing with the rings on his right hand as he spoke, in a constrained, embarrassed way.  \"I come from the king.  Your display of strength irritated him yesterday, and he does not wish to see you again for some time.  His orders are, that you set out for Arabia to buy up all the camels that are to be had.       [Camels are never represented on the Egyptian monuments, whereas      they were in great use among the Arabians and Persians, and are now      a necessity on the Nile.  They must have existed in Egypt, however.      Hekekyan-Bey discovered the bones of a dromedary in a deep bore.      Representations of these creatures were probably forbid We know this      was the case with the cock, of which bird there were large numbers      in Egypt:  It is remarkable, that camels were not introduced into      Barbary until after the birth of Christ.]  \"As these animals can bear thirst very long, they are to be used in conveying food and water for our army on the Ethiopian campaign.  There must be no delay.  Take leave of your wife, and (I speak by the king's command) be ready to start before dark.  You will be absent at least a month.  I am to accompany you as far as Pelusium.  Kassandane wishes to have your wife and child near her during your absence.  Send them to Memphis as soon as possible; under the protection of the queen mother, they will be in safety.\"  Prexaspes' short, constrained way of speaking did not strike Bartja. He rejoiced at what seemed to him great moderation on the part of his brother, and at receiving a commission which relieved him of all doubt on the question of leaving Egypt, gave his friend, (as he supposed him to be), his hand to kiss and an invitation to follow him into the palace.  In the cool of the evening, he took a short but very affectionate farewell of Sappho and his child, who was asleep in Melitta's arms, told his wife to set out as soon as possible on her journey to Kassandane, called out jestingly to his mother-in-law, that at least this time she had been mistaken in her judgment of a man's character, (meaning his brother's), and sprang on to his horse.  As Prexaspes was mounting, Sappho whispered to him, \"Take care of that reckless fellow, and remind him of me and his child, when you see him running into unnecessary danger.\"  \"I shall have to leave him at Pelusium,\" answered  the envoy, busying himself with the bridle of his horse in order to avoid meeting her eyes.  \"Then may the gods take him into their keeping!\"  exclaimed Sappho, clasping her husband's hand, and bursting into tears, which she could not keep back.  Bartja looked down and saw his usually trustful wife in tears.  He felt sadder than he had ever felt before.  Stooping down lovingly from his saddle, he put his strong arm round her waist, lifted her up to him, and as she stood supporting herself on his foot in the stirrup, pressed her to his heart, as if for a long last farewell.  He then let her safely and gently to the ground, took his child up to him on the saddle, kissed and fondled the little creature, and told her laughingly to make her mother very happy while he was away, exchanged some warm words of farewell with Rhodopis, and then, spurring his horse till the creature reared, dashed through the gateway of the Pharaohs' palace, with Prexaspes at his side.  When the sound of the horses' hoofs had died away in the distance, Sappho laid her head on her grandmother's shoulder and wept uncontrollably. Rhodopis remonstrated and blamed, but all in vain, she could not stop her tears.     CHAPTER XV.  On the morning after the trial of the bow, Cambyses was seized by such a violent attack of his old illness, that he was forced to keep his room for two days and nights, ill in mind and body; at times raging like a madman, at others weak and powerless as a little child.  On the third day he recovered consciousness and remembered the awful charge he had laid on Prexaspes, and that it was only too possible he might have executed it already.  At this thought he trembled, as he had never trembled in his life before.  He sent at once for the envoy's eldest son, who was one of the royal cup-bearers.  The boy said his father had left Memphis, without taking leave of his family.  He then sent for Darius, Zopyrus and Gyges, knowing how tenderly they loved Bartja, and enquired after their friend.  On hearing from them that he was at Sais, he sent the three youths thither at once, charging them, if they met Prexaspes on the way, to send him back to Memphis without delay. This haste and the king's strange behavior were quite incomprehensible to the young Achaemenidae; nevertheless they set out on their journey with all speed, fearing that something must be wrong.  Cambyses, meanwhile, was miserably restless, inwardly cursed his habit of drinking and tasted no wine the whole of that clay.  Seeing his mother in the palace-gardens, he avoided her; he durst not meet her eye.  The next eight days passed without any sign of Prexaspes' return; they seemed to the king like a year.  A hundred times he sent for the young cup-bearer and asked if his father had returned; a hundred times he received the same disappointing answer.  At sunset on the thirteenth day, Kassandane sent to beg a visit from him. The king went at once, for now he longed to look on the face of his mother; he fancied it might give him back his lost sleep.  After he had greeted her with a tenderness so rare from him, that it astonished her, he asked for what reason she had desired his presence. She answered, that Bartja's wife had arrived at Memphis under singular circumstances and had said she wished to present a gift to Cambyses.  He gave Sappho an audience at once, and heard from her that Prexaspes had brought her husband an order to start for Arabia, and herself a summons to Memphis from the queen-mother.  At these words the king turned very pale, and his features were agitated with pain as he looked at his brother's lovely young wife.  She felt that something unusual was passing in his mind, and such dreadful forebodings arose in her own, that she could only offer him the gift in silence and with trembling hands.  \"My husband sends you this,\" she said, pointing to the ingeniously- wrought box, which contained the wax likeness of Nitetis.  Rhodopis had advised her to take this to the king in Bartja's name, as a propitiatory offering.  Cambyses showed no curiosity as to the contents of the box, gave it in charge to a eunuch, said a few words which seemed meant as thanks to his sister-in law, and left the women's apartments without even so much as enquiring after Atossa, whose existence he seemed to have forgotten.  He had come to his mother, believing that the visit would comfort and calm his troubled mind, but Sappho's words had destroyed his last hope, and with that his last possibility of rest or peace.  By this time either Prexaspes would already have committed the murder, or perhaps at that very moment might be raising his dagger to plunge it into Bartja's heart.  How could he ever meet his mother again after Bartja's death?  how could he answer her questions or those of that lovely Sappho, whose large, anxious, appealing eyes had touched him so strangely?  A voice within told him, that his brother's murder would be branded as a cowardly, unnatural, and unjust deed, and he shuddered at the thought. It seemed fearful, unbearable, to be called an assassin.  He had already caused the death of many a man without the least compunction, but that had been done either in fair fight, or openly before the world.  He was king, and what the king did was right.  Had he killed Bartja with his own hand, his conscience would not have reproached him; but to have had him privately put out of the way, after he had given so many proofs of possessing first-rate manly qualities, which deserved the highest praise --this tortured him with a feeling of rage at his own want of principle, -a feeling of shame and remorse which he had never known before.  He began to despise himself.  The consciousness of having acted, and wished to act justly, forsook him, and he began to fancy, that every one who had been executed by his orders, had been, like Bartja, an innocent victim of his fierce anger.  These thoughts became so intolerable, that he began to drink once more in the hope of drowning them.  But now the wine had precisely the opposite effect, and brought such tormenting thoughts, that, worn out as he was already by epileptic fits and his habit of drinking, both body and mind threatened to give way to the agitation caused by the events of the last months.  Burning and shivering by turns, he was at last forced to lie down.  While the attendants were disrobing him, he remembered his brother's present, had the box fetched and opened, and then desired to be left alone.  The Egyptian paintings on the outside of the box reminded him of Nitetis, and then he asked himself what she would have said to his deed.  Fever had already begun, and his mind was wandering as he took the beautiful wax bust out of the box.  He stared in horror at the dull, immovable eyes.  The likeness was so perfect, and his judgment so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5459"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 10 (#7)"],["body"," by wine and fever, that he fancied himself the victim of some spell, and yet could not turn his eyes from those dear features.  Suddenly the eyes seemed to move.  He was seized with terror, and, in a kind of convulsion, hurled what he thought had become a living head against the wall.  The hollow, brittle wax broke into a thousand fragments, and Cambyses sank back on to his bed with a groan.  From that moment the fever increased.  In his delirium the banished Phanes appeared, singing a scornful Greek song and deriding him in such infamous words, that his fists clenched with rage.  Then he saw his friend and adviser, Croesus, threatening him in the very same words of warning, which he had used when Bartja had been sentenced to death by his command on account of Nitetis: \"Beware of shedding a brother's blood; the smoke thereof will rise to heaven and become a cloud, that must darken the days of the murderer, and at last cast down the lightnings of heaven upon his head.\"  And in his delirious fancy this figure of speech became a reality.  A rain of blood streamed down upon him from dark clouds; his clothes and hands were wet with the loathsome moisture.  He went down to the Nile to cleanse himself, and suddenly saw Nitetis coming towards him.  She had the same sweet smile with which Theodorus had modelled her.  Enchanted with this lovely vision, he fell down before her and took her hand, but he had scarcely touched it, when drops of blood appeared at the tips of her delicate fingers, and she turned away from him with every sign of horror.  He humbly implored her to forgive him and come back; she remained inexorable.  He grew angry, and threatened her, first with his wrath, and then with awful punishments.  At last, as she only answered his threats by a low scornful laugh, he ventured to throw his dagger at her.  She crumbled at once into a thousand pieces, like the wax statue. But the derisive laughter echoed on, and became louder.  Many voices joined in it, each trying to outbid the other.  And the voices of Bartja and Nitetis were the loudest,--their tone the most bitter.  At last he could bear these fearful sounds no longer and stopped his ears; this was of no use, and he buried his head, first in the glowing desert-sand and then in the icy cold Nile-water, until his senses forsook him.  On awaking, the actual state of things seemed incomprehensible to him.  He had gone to bed in the evening, and yet he now saw, by the direction of the sun's rays which fell on his bed, that, instead of dawning as he had expected, the day was growing dark.  There could be no mistake; he heard the chorus of priests singing farewell to the setting Mithras.  Then he heard a number of people moving behind a curtain, which had been hung up at the head of his bed.  He tried to turn in his bed, but could not; he was too weak.  At last, finding it impossible to discover whether he was in real life or still in a dream, he called for his dressers and the courtiers, who were accustomed to be present when he rose.  They appeared in a moment, and with them his mother, Prexaspes, a number of the learned among the Magi, and some Egyptians who were unknown to him. They told him, that he had been lying in a violent fever for weeks, and had only escaped death by the special mercy of the gods, the skill of the physicians, and the unwearied nursing of his mother.  He looked enquiringly first at Kassandane, then at Prexaspes, lost consciousness again, and fell into a deep sleep, from which he awoke the next morning with renewed strength.  In four days he was strong enough to sit up and able to question Prexaspes on the only subject, which occupied his thoughts.  In consideration of his master's weakness the envoy was beginning an evasive reply, when a threatening movement of the king's gaunt, worn hand, and a look which had by no means lost its old power of awing into submission, brought him to the point at once, and in the hope of giving the king a great pleasure and putting his mind completely at rest, he began: \"Rejoice, O King!  the youth, who dared to desire the disparagement of thy glory, is no more.  This hand slew him and buried his body at Baal-Zephon.  The sand of the desert and the unfruitful waves of the Red Sea were the only witnesses of the deed; and no creature knows thereof beside thyself, O King, thy servant Prexaspes, and the gulls and cormorants, that hover over his grave.\"  The king uttered a piercing shriek of rage, was seized by a fresh shivering-fit, and sank back once more in raving delirium.  Long weeks passed, every day of which threatened its death.  At last, however, his strong constitution gained the day, but his mind had given way, and remained disordered and weak up to his last hour.  When he was strong enough to leave the sick-room and to ride and shoot once more, he abandoned himself more than ever to the pleasure of drinking, and lost every remnant of self-control.  The delusion had fixed itself in his disordered mind, that Bartja was not dead, but transformed into the bow of the King of Ethiopia, and that the Feruer (soul) of his father Cyrus had commanded him to restore Bartja to its original form, by subjugating the black nation.  This idea, which he confided to every one about him as a great secret, pursued him day and night and gave him no rest, until he had started for Ethiopia with an immense host.  He was forced, however, to return without having accomplished his object, after having miserably lost the greater part of his army by heat and the scarcity of provisions.  An historian, who may almost be spoken of as contemporary, tells us that the wretched soldiers, after having subsisted on herbs as long as they could, came to deserts where there was no sign of vegetation, and in their despair resorted to an expedient almost too fearful to describe.  Lots were drawn by every ten men, and he on whom the lot fell was killed and eaten by the other nine.       [Herodotus visited Egypt some 60 years after the death of Cambyses,      454 B.C.  He describes the Ethiopian campaign, III. 25.]  At last things went so far, that his subjects compelled this madman to return, but only, with their slavish Asiatic feelings, to obey him all the more blindly, when they found themselves once more in inhabited regions.  On reaching Memphis with the wreck of his army, he found the Egyptians in glorious apparel celebrating a festival.  They had found a new Apis and were rejoicing over the reappearance of their god, incarnate in the sacred bull.  As Cambyses had heard at Thebes, that the army he had sent against the oasis of Ammon in the Libyan desert, had perished miserably in a Khamsin, or Simoom, and that his fleet, which was to conquer Carthage, had refused to fight with a people of their own race, he fancied that the Memphians must be celebrating a festival of joy at the news of his misfortunes, sent for their principal men, and after reproaching them with their conduct, asked why they had been gloomy and morose after his victories, but joyous at hearing of his misfortunes.  The Memphians answered by explaining the real ground for their merry-making, and told him, that the appearance of the sacred bull was always celebrated in Egypt with the greatest rejoicings.  Cambyses called them liars, and, as such, sentenced them to death.  He then sent for the priests; received, however, exactly the same answer from them.  With the bitterest irony he asked to be allowed to make the acquaintance of this new god, and commanded them to bring him.  The bull Apis was brought and the king told that he was the progeny of a virgin cow and a moonbeam, that he must be black, with a white triangular spot on the forehead, the likeness of an eagle on his back, and on his side the crescent moon.  There must be two kinds of hair on his tail, and on his tongue an excrescence in the form of the sacred beetle Scarabaeus.  When Cambyses saw this deified creature he could discover nothing remarkable in him, and was so enraged that he plunged his sword into its side.  As the blood streamed from the wound and the animal fell, he broke out into a piercing laugh, and cried: \"Ye fools! so your gods are flesh and blood; they can be wounded.  Such folly is worthy of you.  But ye shall find, that it is not so easy to make a fool of me.  Ho, guards! flog these priests soundly, and kill every one whom you find taking part in this mad celebration.\"  The command was obeyed and fearfully exasperated the Egyptians.       [According to Herod. III. 29.  Cambyses' sword slipped and ran into      the leg of the sacred bull.  As the king died also of a wound in the      thigh, this just suits Herodotus, who always tries to put the      retribution that comes after presumptuous crime in the strongest      light; but it is very unlikely that the bull should have died of a      mere thigh wound.]  Apis died of his wound; the Memphians buried him secretly in the vaults belonging to the sacred bulls, near the Serapeum, and, led by Psamtik, attempted an insurrection against the Persians.  This was very quickly put down, however, and cost Psamtik his life,--a life the stains and severities of which deserve to be forgiven, in consideration of his unwearied, ceaseless efforts to deliver his people from a foreign yoke, and his death in the cause of freedom.  Cambyses' madness had meanwhile taken fresh forms.  After the failure of his attempt to restore Bartja, (transformed as he fancied into a bow) to his original shape, his irritability increased so frightfully that a single word, or even a look, was sufficient to make him furious.  Still his true friend and counsellor, Croesus, never left him, though the king had more than once given him over to the guards for execution.  But the guards knew their master; they took good care not to lay hands on the old man, and felt sure of impunity, as the king would either have forgotten his command, or repented of it by the next day, Once,"]]]
