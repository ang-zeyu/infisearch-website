This I considered the height of insolence, and cried   for help, when my father and mother both came running to my rescue.   My father stripped and tied him, and took him into the orchard,   where switches were plenty, and directed me to whip him; when one   switch wore out, he supplied me with others. After I had whipped him   a while, he fell on his knees to implore forgiveness, and I kicked   him in the face; my father said, “Don’t kick him, but whip him;”   this I did until his back was literally covered with _welts_. I know   I have repented, and trust I have obtained pardon for these things.    My father owned a woman (we used to call aunt Grace); she was   purchased in Old Virginia. She has told me that her old master, in   his _will_, gave her her freedom, but at his death his sons had sold   her to my father: when he bought her she manifested some   unwillingness to go with him, when she was put in irons and taken by   force. This was before I was born; but I remember to have seen the   irons, and was told that was what they had been used for. Aunt Grace   is still living, and must be between seventy and eighty years of   age; she has, for the last forty years, been an exemplary Christian.   When I was a youth I took some pains to learn her to read; this is   now a great consolation to her. Since age and infirmity have   rendered her of little value to her “owners,” she is permitted to   read as much as she pleases; this she can do, with the aid of   glasses, in the old family Bible, which is almost the only book she   has ever looked into. This, with some little mending for the black   children, is all she does; she is still held as a slave. I well   remember what _a heart-rending scene_ there was in the family when   _my father sold her husband_; this was, I suppose, thirty-five years   ago. And yet my father was considered one of the best of masters. I   know of few who were better, but of _many_ who were worse.  With regard to the intelligence of George, and his teaching himself to read and write, there is a most interesting and affecting parallel to it in the “Life of Frederick Douglass,”—a book which can be recommended to any one who has a curiosity to trace the workings of an intelligent and active mind through all the squalid misery, degradation and oppression, of slavery. A few incidents will be given.  Like Clark, Douglass was the son of a white man. He was a plantation slave in a proud old family. His situation, probably, may be considered as an average one; that is to say, he led a life of dirt, degradation, discomfort of various kinds, made tolerable as a matter of daily habit, and considered as enviable in comparison with the lot of those who suffer worse abuse. An incident which Douglass relates of his mother is touching. He states that it is customary at an early age to separate mothers from their children, for the purpose of blunting and deadening natural affection. When he was three years old his mother was sent to work on a plantation eight or ten miles distant, and after that he never saw her except in the night. After her day’s toil she would occasionally walk over to her child, lie down with him in her arms, hush him to sleep in her bosom, then rise up and walk back again to be ready for her field work by daylight. Now, we ask the highest-born lady in England or America, who is a mother, whether this does not show that this poor field-laborer had in her bosom, beneath her dirt and rags, a true mother’s heart?  The last and bitterest indignity which has been heaped on the head of the unhappy slaves has been the denial to them of those holy affections which God gives alike to all. We are told, in fine phrase, by languid ladies of fashion, that “it is not to be supposed that those creatures have the same feelings that we have,” when, perhaps, the very speaker could not endure one tithe of the fatigue and suffering which the slave-mother often bears for her child. Every mother who has a mother’s heart within her, ought to know that this is blasphemy against nature, and, standing between the cradle of her living and the grave of her dead child, should indignantly reject such a slander on all motherhood.  Douglass thus relates the account of his learning to read, after he had been removed to the situation of house-servant in Baltimore.  It seems that his mistress, newly married and unaccustomed to the management of slaves, was very kind to him, and, among other acts of kindness, commenced teaching him to read. His master, discovering what was going on, he says,    At once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among   other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a   slave to read. To use his own words, further, he said, “If you give   a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing   but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would   _spoil_ the best nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach   that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no   keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at   once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to   himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would   make him discontented and unhappy.” There words sank deep into my   heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called   into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and   special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with   which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in   vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing   difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man.   It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that   moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom.  After this, his mistress was as watchful to prevent his learning to read as she had before been to instruct him. His course after this he thus describes:    From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate   room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of   having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself.   All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken.   Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the _inch_, and   no precaution could prevent me from taking the _ell_.    The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most   successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys   whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could I converted   into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times   and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read.   When I was sent of errands I always took my book with me, and by   going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson   before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of   which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome;   for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white   children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the   hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more   valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names   of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the   gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that   it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an   unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian   country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they   lived on Philpot-street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I   used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would   sometimes say to them I wished I could be as free as they would be   when they got to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are   twenty-one, _but I am a slave for life_! Have not I as good a right   to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they   would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the   hope that something would occur by which I might be free.    I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being _a slave   for life_ began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time   I got hold of a book entitled “The Columbian Orator.” Every   opportunity I got I used to read this book. Among much of other   interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and   his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his   master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which   took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time.   In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was   brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the   slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as well as   impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the   desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in   the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.    In the same book I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and   in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to   me. I read them over and over again, with unabated interest. They   gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had   frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of   utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power   of truth over the conscience of even a slave-holder."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54812"],["title","A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (#8)"],["body"," I got from   Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful   vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled   me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward   to sustain slavery; but, while they relieved me of one difficulty,   they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I   was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and   detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a   band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to   Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced   us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the   most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold!   that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would   follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my   soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times   feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing.   It had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy.   It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which   to get out. In moments of agony I envied my fellow-slaves for their   stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the   condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Anything, no matter   what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my   condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was   pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or   inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal   wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It   was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever   present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw   nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and   felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it   smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every   storm.    I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself   dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I   should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have   been killed. While in this state of mind I was eager to hear any one   speak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while I could   hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I   found what the word meant. It was always used in such connections as   to make it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and   succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set   fire to a barn, or did anything very wrong in the mind of a   slave-holder, it was spoken of as the fruit of _abolition_. Hearing   the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it   meant. The dictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was   “the act of abolishing;” but then I did not know what was to be   abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not dare to ask any one about   its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted   me to know very little about. After a patient waiting, I got one of   our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions   from the North praying for the abolition of slavery in the District   of Columbia, and of the slave-trade between the states. From this   time I understood the words _abolition_ and _abolitionist_, and   always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear   something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves. The light broke   in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf of Mr.   Waters; and, seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went,   unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came to   me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are   ye a slave for life?” I told him that I was. The good Irishman   seemed to be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other   that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a   slave for life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised   me to run away to the North; that I should find friends there, and   that I should be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they   said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared   they might be treacherous. White men have been known to encourage   slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return   them to their masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men   might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and   from that time I resolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at   which it would be safe for me to escape. I was too young to think of   doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I   might have occasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the   hope that I should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile I would   learn to write.    The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by   being in Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the   ship carpenters, after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready   for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for   which it was intended. When a piece of timber was intended for the   larboard side it would be marked thus—“L.” When a piece was for the   starboard side it would be marked thus—“S.” A piece for the larboard   side forward would be marked thus—“L. F.” When a piece was for   starboard side forward it would be marked thus—“S. F.” For larboard   aft it would be marked thus—“L. A.” For starboard aft it would be   marked thus—“S. A.” I soon learned the names of these letters, and   for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in   the ship-yard. I immediately commenced copying them, and in a short   time was able to make the four letters named. After that, when I met   with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write   as well as he. The next word would be, “I don’t believe you. Let me   see you try it.” I would then make the letters which I had been so   fortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I got a   good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should   never have gotten in any other way. During this time my copy-book   was the board fence, brick wall and pavement; my pen and ink was a   lump of chalk. With these I learned mainly how to write. I then   commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster’s   Spelling-book, until I could make them all without looking on the   book. By this time my little Master Thomas had gone to school and   learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.   These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near   neighbors, and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to   class-meeting at the Wilk-street meeting-house every Monday   afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house. When left thus I   used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master   Thomas’ copy-book, copying what he had written. I continued to do   this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master   Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally   succeeded in learning how to write.  These few quoted incidents will show that the case of George Harris is by no means so uncommon as might be supposed.  Let the reader peruse the account which George Harris gives of the sale of his mother and her children, and then read the following account given by the venerable Josiah Henson, now pastor of the missionary settlement at Dawn, in Canada.  After the death of his master, he says, the slaves of the plantation were all put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder.    My brothers and sisters were bid off one by one, while my mother,   holding my hand, looked on in an agony of grief, the cause of which   I but ill understood at first, but which dawned on my mind with   dreadful clearness as the sale proceeded. My mother was then   separated from me, and put up in her turn. She was bought by a man   named Isaac R., residing in Montgomery County [Maryland], and then I   was offered to the assembled purchasers. My mother, half distracted   with the parting forever from all her children, pushed through the   crowd, while the bidding for me was going on, to the spot where R.   was standing. She fell at his feet, and clung to his knees,   entreating him, in tones that a mother only could command, to buy   her _baby_ as well as herself, and spare to her one of her little   ones at least. Will it, can it be believed, that this man, thus   appealed to, was capable not merely of turning a deaf ear to her   supplication, but of disengaging himself from her with such violent   blows and kicks as to reduce her to the necessity of creeping out of   his reach, and mingling the groan of bodily suffering with the sob   of a breaking heart?  Now, all these incidents that have been given are _real_ incidents of slavery, related by those who know slavery by the best of all tests—experience; and they are given by men who have earned a character in freedom which makes their word as good as the word of any man living.  The case of Lewis Clark might be called a harder one than common. The case of Douglass is probably a very fair average specimen.  The writer has conversed, in her time, with a very considerable number of liberated slaves, many of whom stated that their own individual lot had been comparatively a mild one; but she never talked with one who did not let fall, first or last, some incident which he had observed, some scene which he had witnessed, which went to show some most horrible abuse of the system; and, what was most affecting about it, the narrator often evidently considered it so much a matter of course as to mention it incidentally, without any"]]]
