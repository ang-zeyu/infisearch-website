When Dion perceived his friend, and Barine raised her head, turning her face towards him, it was indeed wet with tears, but their source could not be sorrow; for her blue eyes were sparkling with a happy light.  Yet Gorgias found something in her features which he was unable to express in words--the reflection of the ardent gratitude that had taken possession of her soul and filled it absolutely.  While seeking the architect, Dion had met Barine, who was on her way to her grandparents, and what he had dreaded the day before happened.  The first glance from her eyes which met his forced the decisive question from his lips.  In brief, earnest words he confessed his love for her, and his desire to make her his own, as the pride and ornament of his house.  Then, in the intensity of her bliss, her eyes overflowed and, under the spell of a great miracle wrought in her behalf, she found no words to answer; but Dion had approached, clasped her right hand in both of his, and frankly acknowledged how, with the image of his strict mother before his eyes, he had wavered and hesitated until love had overmastered him. Now, full of the warmest confidence, he asked whether she would consent to rule as mistress of his home, the honour and ornament of his ancient name?  He knew that her heart was his, but he must hear one thing more from her lips--  Here she had interrupted him with the cry, \"This one thing--that your wife, in joy and in sorrow, will live for you and you alone?  The whole world can vanish for her, now that you have raised her to your side and she is yours.\"  After this assurance, which sounded like an oath, Dion felt as if a heavy burden had fallen from his heart, and clasping her in his arms with passionate tenderness, he repeated, \"In joy and in sorrow!\"  Thus Gorgias and Helena had surprised them, and the architect felt for the first time that there is no distinction between our own happiness and that of those whom we love.  His friend Helena seemed to have the same feeling, when she saw what this day had given her sister; and the philosopher's house, so lately shadowed by anxiety, and many a fear, would soon ring with voices uttering joyous congratulations.  The architect no longer felt that he had a place in this circle, which was now pervaded by a great common joy, and after Dion made a brief explanation, Gorgias's voice was soon heard outside loudly issuing orders to the workmen.

D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 4.    CHAPTER IX.  Gorgias went to his work without delay.  When the twin statues were only waiting to be erected in front of the Theatre of Dionysus, Dion sought him.  Some impulse urged him to talk to his old friend before leaving the city with his betrothed bride.  Since they parted the latter had accomplished the impossible; for the building of the wall on the Choma, ordered by Antony, was commenced, the restoration of the little palace at the point, and many other things connected with the decoration of the triumphal arches, were arranged.  His able and alert foreman found it difficult to follow him as he dictated order after order in his writing- tablet.  The conversation with his friend was not a long one, for Dion had promised Barine and her mother to accompany them to the country. Notwithstanding the betrothal, they were to start that very day; for Caesarion had called upon Barine twice that morning.  She had not received him, but the unfortunate youth's conduct induced her to hasten the preparations for her departure.  To avoid attracting attention, they were to use Archibius's large travelling chariot and Nile boat, although Dion's were no less comfortable.  The marriage was to take place in the \"abode of peace.\"  The young Alexandrian's own ship, which was to convey the newly wedded pair to Alexandria, bore the name of Peitho, the goddess of persuasion, for Dion liked to be reminded of his oratorical powers in the council. Henceforward it would be called the Barine, and was to receive many an embellishment.  Dion confided to his friend what he had learned in relation to the fate of the Queen and the fleet, and, notwithstanding the urgency of the claims upon Gorgias's time, he lingered to discuss the future destiny of the city and her threatened liberty; for these things lay nearest to his heart.  \"Fortunately,\" cried Dion, \"I followed my inclination; now it seems to me that duty commands every true man to make his own house a nursery for the cultivation of the sentiments which he inherited from his forefathers and which must not die, so long as there are Macedonian citizens in Alexandria.  We must submit if the superior might of Rome renders Egypt a province of the republic, but we can preserve to our city and her council the lion's share of their freedom.  Whatever may be the development of affairs, we are and shall remain the source whence Rome draws the largest share of the knowledge which enriches her brain.\"  \"And the art which adorns her rude life,\" replied Gorgias.  \"If she is free to crush us without pity, she will fare, I think, like the maiden who raises her foot to trample on a beautiful, rare flower, and then withdraws it because it would be a crime to destroy so exquisite a work of the Creator.\"  \"And what  does  the  flower owe to your maiden,\" cried Dion, \"or our city to Rome?  Let us meet her claims with dignified resolution, then I think we shall not have the worst evils to fear.\"  \"Let us hope so.  But, my friend, keep your eyes open for other than Roman foes.  Now that it will become known that you do not love her, beware of Iras.  There is something about her which reminds me of the jackal.  Jealousy!--I believe she would be capable of the worst--\"  \"Yet,\" Dion interrupted, \"Charmian will soften whatever injury Iras plans to do me, and, though I cannot rely much upon my uncle, Archibius is above both and favours us and our marriage.\"  Gorgias uttered a sigh of relief, and exclaimed, \"Then on to happiness!\"  \"And you must also begin to provide for yours,\" replied Dion warmly. \"Forbid your heart to continue this wandering, nomad life.  The tent which the wind blows down is not fit for the architect's permanent residence.  Build yourself a fine house, which will defy storms, as you built my palace.  I shall not grudge it, and have already said, the times demand it.\"  \"I will remember the advice,\" replied Gorgias.  \"But six eyes are again bent upon me for direction.  There are so many important things to be done while we waste the hours in building triumphal arches for the defeated--trophies for an overthrow.  But your uncle has just issued orders to complete the work in the most magnificent style.  The ways of destiny and the great are dark; may the brightest sunshine illumine yours!  A prosperous journey!  We shall hear, of course, when you celebrate the wedding, and if I can I shall join you in the Hymenaeus. Lucky fellow that you are!  Now I'm summoned from over yonder!  May Castor and Pollux, and all the gods favourable to travel, Aphrodite, and all the Loves attend your trip to Irenia, and protect you in the realm of Eros and Hymen!\"  With these words the warm-hearted man clasped his friend to his breast for the first time.  Dion cordially responded, and at last shook his hard right hand with the exclamation:  \"Farewell, then, till we meet in Irenia on the wedding day, you dear, faithful fellow.\"  Then he entered the chariot which stood waiting, and Gorgias gazed after him thoughtfully.  The hyacinthine purple cloak which Dion wore that day had not vanished from his sight when a loud crashing, rattling, and roaring arose behind him.  A hastily erected scaffold, which was to support the pulleys for raising the statues, had collapsed.  The damage could be easily repaired, but the accident aroused a troubled feeling in the architect's mind.  He was a child of his time, a period when duty commanded the prudent man to heed omens.  Experience also taught him that when such a thing happened in his work something unpleasant was apt to occur within the circle of his friends.  The veil of the future concealed what might be in store for the beloved couple; but he resolved to keep his eyes open on Dion's behalf and to request Archibius to do the same.  The pressure of work, however, soon silenced the sense of uneasiness. The damage was speedily repaired, and later Gorgias, sometimes with one, sometimes with another tablet or roll of MS. in his hand, issued the most varied orders.  Gradually the light of this dismal day faded.  Ere the night, which threatened to bring rain and storm, closed in, he again rode on his mule to the Bruchium to overlook the progress of the work in the various buildings and give additional directions, for the labour was to be continued during the night.  The north wind was now blowing so violently from the sea that it was difficult to keep the torches and lamps lighted.  The gale drove the drops of rain into his face, and a glance northward showed him masses of black clouds beyond the harbour and the lighthouse.  This indicated a bad night, and again the boding sense of coming misfortune stole over him. Yet he set to work swiftly and prudently, helping with his own hands when occasion required.  Night closed in.  Not a star was visible in the sky, and the air, chilled by the north wind, grew so cold that Gorgias at last permitted his body slave to wrap his cloak around him.  While drawing the hood over his head, he gazed at a procession of litters and men moving towards Lochias.  Perhaps the Queen's children were returning home from some expedition. But probably they were rather private citizens on their way to some festival celebrating the victory; for every one now believed in a great battle and a successful issue of the war.  This was proved by the shouts and cheers of the people, who, spite of the storm, were still moving to and fro near the harbour.  The last of the torch-bearers had just passed Gorgias, and he had told himself that a train of litters belonging to the royal family would not move through the darkness so faintly lighted, when a single man, bearing in his hand a lantern, whose flickering rays shone on his wrinkled face, approached rapidly from the opposite direction.  It was old Phryx, Didymus's house slave, with whom the architect had become acquainted, while the aged scholar was composing the inscription for the Odeum which Gorgias had erected.  The aged servant had brought him many alterations of his master's first sketch, and Gorgias had reminded him of it the previous day.  The workmen by whom the statues had been raised to the pedestal, amid the bright glare of torches, to the accompaniment of a regular chant, had just dropped the ropes, windlasses, and levers, when the architect recognized the slave.  What did the old man want at so late an hour on this dark night?  The fall of the scaffold again returned to his mind.  Was the slave seeking for a member of the family?  Did Helena need assistance?  He stopped the gray-haired man, who answered his question with a heavy sigh, followed by the maxim, \"Misfortunes come in pairs, like oxen.\"  Then he continued: \"Yesterday there was great anxiety. Today, when there was so much rejoicing on account of Barine, I thought directly, 'Sorrow follows joy, and the second misfortune won't be spared us.'  And so it proved.\"  Gorgias anxiously begged him to relate what had happened, and the old man, drawing nearer, whispered that the pupil and assistant of Didymus-- young Philotas of Amphissa, a student, and, moreover, a courteous young man of excellent family--had gone to a banquet to which Antyllus, the son of Antony, had invited several of his classmates.  This had already happened several times, and he, Phryx, had warned him, for, when the lowly associate with the lofty, the lowly rarely escape kicks and blows. The young fellow, who usually had behaved no worse than the other Ephebi, had always returned from such festivities with a flushed face and unsteady steps, but to-night he had not even reached his room in the upper story.  He had darted into the house as though pursued by the watch, and, while trying to rush up the"]]]
