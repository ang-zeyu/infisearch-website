Golden boats were sailing on this lake and in them sat lovely boys and girls dressed in snow-white garments, and singing sweet songs as they passed over the water.  There were no rowers to direct these boats, and yet they moved over the ripples of the lake in a graceful order, as if guided by some magic unseen hand.  A large ship sailed in the midst of this little fleet.  Its deck glittered with precious stones.  It seemed to be steered by one beautiful boy only, and, strange to say, the rudder he guided consisted of one white lotusflower, the delicate leaves of which seemed scarcely to touch the water.  A very lovely woman, dressed like a queen, lay on silken cushions in the middle of the vessel; by her side sat a man of larger stature than that of ordinary mortals.  He wore a crown of ivy on his flowing curls, a panther-skin hung over his shoulders and he held a crooked staff in the right hand.  In the back part of the ship was a roof made of ivy, lotus- blossoms and roses; beneath it stood a milk-white cow with golden horns, covered with a cloth of purple.  The man was Osiris, the woman Isis, the boy at the helm their son Horus, and the cow was the animal sacred to the immortal Isis.  The little boats all skimmed over the water, singing glad songs of joy as they passed by the ship, and receiving in return showers of flowers and fruits, thrown down upon the lovely singers by the god and goddess within.  Suddenly I heard the roll of thunder.  It came crashing on, louder, and louder, and in the midst of this awful sound a man in the skin of a wild boar, with hideous features and bristling red hair, came out of the gloomiest part of the sacred grove, plunged into the lake, followed by seventy creatures like himself, and swam up to the ship of Osiris.       [We have taken our description of this spectacle entirely from the      Osiris-myth, as we find it in Plutarch, Isis and Orisis 13-19.      Diod. I. 22. and a thousand times repeated on the monuments.  Horus      is called \"the avenger of his father,\" &c.  We copy the battle with      all its phases from an inscription at Edfu, interpreted by Naville.]  \"The little boats fled with the swiftness of the wind, and the trembling boy helmsman dropped his lotusblossom.  \"The dreadful monster then rushed on Osiris, and, with the help of his comrades, killed him, threw the body into a coffin and the coffin into the lake, the waters of which seemed to carry it away as if by magic. Isis meanwhile had escaped to land in one of the small boats, and was now running hither and thither on the shores of the lake, with streaming hair, lamenting her dead husband and followed by the virgins who had escaped with her.  Their songs and dances, while seeking the body of Osiris, were strangely plaintive and touching, and the girls accompanied the dance by waving black Byssus scarfs in wonderfully graceful curves. Neither were the youths idle; they busied themselves in making a costly coffin for the vanished corpse of the god, accompanying their work with dances and the sound of castanets.  When this was finished they joined the maidens in the train of the lamenting Isis and wandered on the shore with them, singing and searching.  \"Suddenly a low song rose from some invisible lips.  It swelled louder and louder and announced, that the body of the god had been transported by the currents of the Mediterranean to Gebal in distant Phoenicia.  This singing voice thrilled to my very heart; Neithotep's son, who was my companion, called it 'the wind of rumor.'  \"When Isis heard the glad news, she threw off her mourning garments and sang a song of triumphant rejoicing, accompanied by the voices of her beautiful followers.  Rumor had not lied; the goddess really found the sarcophagus and the dead body of her husband on the northern shore of the lake.       [It is natural, that Isis should find the body of her husband in the      north.  The connection between Phoenicia and Egypt in this myth, as      it has been handed down to us by Plutarch, is very remarkable.  We      consider the explanation of the close affinity between the Isis and      Osiris and the Adonis myths to be in the fact, that Egyptians and      Phoenicians lived together on the shores of the Delta where the      latter had planted their colonies.  Plutarch's story of the finding      of Osiris' dead body is very charming.  Isis and Osiris.  Ed. Parth.      15.]  \"They brought both to land with dances; Isis threw herself on the beloved corpse, called on the name of Osiris and covered the mummy with kisses, while the youths wove a wonderful tomb of lotus-flowers and ivy.  \"When the coffin had been laid under this beautiful vault, Isis left the sad place of mourning and went to look for her son.  She found him at the east end of the lake, where for a long time I had seen a beautiful youth practising arms with a number of companions.  \"While she was rejoicing over her newly-found child, a fresh peal of thunder told that Typhon had returned.  This time the monster rushed upon the beautiful flowering grave, tore the body out of its coffin, hewed it into fourteen pieces, and strewed them over the shores of the lake.  \"When Isis came back to the grave, she found nothing but faded flowers and an empty coffin; but at fourteen different places on the shore fourteen beautiful colored flames were burning.  She and her virgins ran to these flames, while Horus led the youths to battle against Typhon on the opposite shore.  \"My eyes and ears hardly sufficed for all I had to see and hear.  On the one shore a fearful and interesting struggle, peals of thunder and the braying of trumpets; on the other the sweet voices of the women, singing the most captivating songs to the most enchanting dances, for Isis had found a portion of her husband's body at every fire and was rejoicing.  \"That was something for you, Zopyrus!  I know of no words to describe the grace of those girls' movements, or how beautiful it was to see them first mingling in intricate confusion, then suddenly standing in faultless, unbroken lines, falling again into the same lovely tumult and passing once more into order, and all this with the greatest swiftness. Bright rays of light flashed from their whirling ranks all the time, for each dancer had a mirror fastened between her shoulders, which flashed while she was in motion, and reflected the scene when she was still.  \"Just as Isis had found the last limb but one of the murdered Osiris, loud songs of triumph and the flourish of trumpets resounded from the opposite shore.  \"Horus had conquered Typhon, and was forcing his way into the nether regions to free his father.  The gate to this lower world opened on the west side of the lake and was guarded by a fierce female hippopotamus.  \"And now a lovely music of flutes and harps came nearer and nearer, heavenly perfumes rose into the air, a rosy light spread over the sacred grove, growing brighter every minute, and Osiris came up from the lower world, led by his victorious son.  Isis hastened to embrace her risen and delivered husband, gave the beautiful Horus his lotus-flower again instead of the sword, and scattered fruits and flowers over the earth, while Osiris seated himself under a canopy wreathed with ivy, and received the homage of all the spirits of the earth and of the Amenti.\"       [The lower world, in Egyptian Amenti, properly speaking, the West or      kingdom of death, to which the soul returns at the death of the      body, as the sun at his setting.  In a hieroglyphic inscription of      the time of the Ptolemies the Amenti is called Hades.]  Darius was silent.  Rhodopis began:  \"We thank you for your charming account; but this strange spectacle must have a higher meaning, and we should thank you doubly if you would explain that to us.\"  \"Your idea is quite right,\" answered Darius, \"but what I know I dare not tell.  I was obliged to promise Neithotep with an oath, not to tell tales out of school.\"  \"Shall I tell you,\" asked Rhodopis, \"what conclusions various hints from Pythagoras and Onuphis have led me to draw, as to the meaning of this drama?  Isis seems to me to represent the bountiful earth; Osiris, humidity or the Nile, which makes the earth fruitful; Horus, the young spring; Typhon, the scorching drought.  The bounteous earth, robbed of her productive power, seeks this beloved husband with lamentations in the cooler regions of the north, where the Nile discharges his waters.  At last Horus, the young springing power of nature, is grown up and conquers Typhon, or the scorching drought.  Osiris, as is the case with the fruitful principle of nature, was only apparently dead, rises from the nether regions and once more rules the blessed valley of the Nile, in concert with his wife, the bounteous earth.\"  \"And as the murdered god behaved properly in the lower regions,\" said Zopyrus, laughing, \"he is allowed, at the end of this odd story, to receive homage from the inhabitants of Hamestegan, Duzakh and Gorothman, or whatever they call these abodes for the Egyptian spirit-host.\"  \"They are called Amenti,\" said Darius, falling into his friend's merry mood; but you must know that the history of this divine pair represents not only the life of nature, but also that of the human soul, which, like the murdered Osiris, lives an eternal life, even when the body is dead.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the other; \"I'll try to remember that if I should chance to die in Egypt.  But really, cost what it may, I must see this wonderful sight soon.\"  \"Just my own wish,\" said Rhodopis.  \"Age is inquisitive.\"  \"Yo"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5459"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 10 (#3)"],["body","will never be old,\" interrupted Darius.  \"Your conversation and your features have remained alike beautiful, and your mind is as clear and bright as your eyes.\"  \"Forgive me for interrupting you,\" said Rhodopis, as if she had not heard his flattering words, \"but the word 'eyes' reminds me of the oculist Nebenchari, and my memory fails me so often, that I must ask you what has become of him, before I forget.  I hear nothing now of this skilful operator to whom the noble Kassandane owes her sight.\"  \"He is much to be pitied,\" replied Darius.  \"Even before we reached Pelusium he had begun to avoid society, and scorned even to speak with his countryman Onuphis.  His gaunt old servant was the only being allowed to wait on or be with him.  But after the battle his whole behavior changed.  He went to the king with a radiant countenance, and asked permission to accompany him to Sais, and to choose two citizens of that town to be his slaves.  Cambyses thought he could not refuse anything to the man, who had been such a benefactor to his mother, and granted him full power to do what he wished.  On arriving at Amasis' capital, he went at once to the temple of Neith, caused the high-priest (who had moreover placed himself at the head of the citizens hostile to Persia), to be arrested, and with him a certain oculist named Petammon.  He then informed them that, as punishment for the burning of certain papers, they would be condemned to serve a Persian to whom he should sell them, for the term of their natural lives, and to perform the most menial services of slaves in a foreign country.  I was present at this scene, and I assure you I trembled before the Egyptian as he said these words to his enemies.  Neithotep, however, listened quietly, and when Nebenchari had finished, answered him thus: If thou, foolish son, hast betrayed thy country for the sake of thy burnt manuscripts, the deed has been neither just nor wise.  I preserved thy valuable works with the greatest care, laid them up in our temple, and sent a complete copy to the library at Thebes.  Nothing was burnt but the letters from Amasis to thy father, and a worthless old chest.  Psamtik and Petammon were present, and it was then and there resolved that a new family tomb in the city of the dead should be built for thee as a compensation for the loss of papers, which, in order to save Egypt, we were unfortunately forced to destroy.  On its walls thou canst behold pleasing paintings of the gods to whom thou hast devoted thy life, the most sacred chapters from the book of the dead, and many other beautiful pictures touching thine own life and character.\"  \"The physician turned very pale--asked first to see his books, and then his new and beautifully-fitted-up tomb.  He then gave his slaves their freedom, (notwithstanding which they were still taken to Memphis as prisoners of war), and went home, often passing his hand across his forehead on the way, and with the uncertain step of one intoxicated. On reaching his house he made a will, bequeathing all he possessed to the grandson of his old servant Hib, and, alleging that he was ill, went to bed.  The next morning he was found dead.  He had poisoned himself with the fearful strychnos-juice.\"  \"Miserable man\" said Croesus.  \"The gods had blinded him, and he reaped despair instead of revenge, as a reward for his treachery.\"  \"I pity him,\" murmured Rhodopis.  \"But look, the rowers are taking in their oars.  We are at the end of our journey; there are your litters and carriages waiting for you.  It was a beautiful trip.  Farewell, my dear ones; come to Naukratis soon,  I shall return at once with Theopompus and Syloson.  Give little Parmys a thousand kisses from me, and tell Melitta never to take her out at noon.  It is dangerous for the eyes.  Good- night, Croesus; good-night, friends, farewell my dear son.\"  The Persians left the vessel with many a nod and farewell word, and Bartja, looking round once more, missed his footing and fell on the landing-pier.  He sprang up in a moment without Zopyrus' help, who came running back, calling out, \"Take care, Bartja!  It's unlucky to fall in stepping ashore.  I did the very same thing, when we left the ship that time at Naukratis.\"     CHAPTER XIV.  While our friends were enjoying their row on the Nile, Cambyses' envoy, Prexaspes, had returned from a mission to the long-lived Ethiopians.  He praised their strength and stature, described the way to their country as almost inaccessible to a large army, and had plenty of marvellous tales to tell.  How, for instance; they always chose the strongest and handsomest man in their nation for their king, and obeyed him unconditionally: how many of them reached the age of 120 years, and some even passed it: how they ate nothing but boiled flesh, drank new milk and washed in a spring the waters of which had the scent of violets, gave a remarkable lustre to their skins, and were so light that wood could not swim in them: how their captives wore golden fetters, because other metals were rare and dear in their country; and lastly, how they covered the bodies of the dead with plaster or stucco, over which a coating of some glass-like material was poured, and kept the pillars thus formed one year in their houses, during which time sacrifices were offered them, and at the year's end they were placed in rows around the town.  The king of this strange people had accepted Cambyses' presents, saying, in a scornful tone, that he new well his friendship was of no importance to the Persians, and Prexaspes had only been sent to spy out the land. If the prince of Asia were a just man, he would be contented with his own immense empire and not try to subjugate a people who had done him no wrong.  \"Take your king this bow,\" he said, \"and advise him not to begin the war with us, until the Persians are able to bend such weapons as easily as we do.  Cambyses may thank the gods, that the Ethiopians have never taken it into their heads to conquer countries which do not belong to them.\"  He then unbent his mighty bow of ebony, and gave it to Prexaspes to take to his lord.  Cambyses laughed at the bragging African, invited his nobles to a trial of the bow the next morning, and awarded Prexaspes for the clever way in which he had overcome the difficulties of his journey and acquitted himself of his mission.  He then went to rest, as usual intoxicated, and fell into a disturbed sleep, in which he dreamed that Bartja was seated on the throne of Persia, and that the crown of his head touched the heavens.  This was a dream, which he could interpret without the aid of soothsayer or Chaldean.  It roused his anger first, and then made him thoughtful.  He could not sleep, and such questions as the following came into his mind: \"Haven't you given your brother reason to feel revengeful?  Do you think he can forget that you imprisoned and condemned him to death, when he was innocent?  And if he should raise his hand against you, would not all the Achaemenidae take his part?  Have I ever done, or have I any intention of ever doing anything to win the love of these venal courtiers?  Since Nitetis died and that strange Greek fled, has there been a single human being, in whom I have the least confidence or on whose affection I can rely?\"  These thoughts and questionings excited him so fearfully, that he sprang from his bed, crying: \"Love and I have nothing to do with one another. Other men maybe kind and good if they like; I must be stern, or I shall fall into the hands of those who hate me--hate me because I have been just, and have visited heavy sins with heavy chastisements.  They whisper flattering words in my ear; they curse me when my back is turned.  The gods themselves must be my enemies, or why do they rob me of everything I love, deny me posterity and even that military glory which is my just due?  Is Bartja so much better than I, that everything which I am forced to give up should be his in hundred-fold measure?  Love, friendship, fame, children, everything flows to him as the rivers to the sea, while my heart is parched like the desert.  But I am king still.  I can show him which is the stronger of us two, and I will, though his forehead may touch the heavens.  In Persia there can be only one great man.  He or I, --I or he.  In a few days I'll send him back to Asia and make him satrap of Bactria.  There he can nurse his child and listen to his wife's songs, while I am winning glory in Ethiopia, which it shall not be in his power to lessen.  Ho, there, dressers!  bring my robes and a good morning- draught of wine.  I'll show the Persians that I'm fit to be King of Ethiopia, and can beat them all at bending a bow.  Here, give me another cup of wine.  I'd bend that bow, if it were a young cedar and its string a cable!\"  So saying he drained an immense bowl of wine and went into the palace-garden, conscious of his enormous strength and therefore sure of success.  All his nobles were assembled waiting for him there, welcomed him with loud acclamations, and fell on their faces to the ground before their king.  Pillars, connected by scarlet cords, had been quickly set up between the closely-cut hedges and straight avenues.  From these cords, suspended by gold and silver rings, yellow and dark blue hangings fluttered in the breeze.  Gilded wooden benches had been placed round in a large circle, and nimble cup-bearers handed wine in costly vessels to the company assembled for the shooting-match.  At a sign from the king the Achaemenidae rose from the earth.  Cambyses glanced over their ranks, and his face brightened on seeing that Bartja was not there.  Prexaspes handed him the Ethiopian bow, and pointed out a target at some distance.  Cambyses laughed at the large size of the target, weighted the bow with his right hand, challenged his subjects to try their fortune first, and handed the bow to the aged Hystaspes, as the highest in rank among the Achaemenidae.  While Hystaspes "]]]
