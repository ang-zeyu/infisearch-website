Here, on miserable couches, lay an old man shivering, and showing dark spots on his bare breast and face: and a child of five, whose crimson cheeks were burning with fever.  Heliodora felt as if she must suffocate in the plague stricken, heavy atmosphere, and Katharina clung to her helplessly; but the soothsayer pulled her away, saying: \"Each to one bed: you to the child, and you-- the old man.\"  Involuntarily they obeyed the woman who was panting with fright.  The water-wagtail, who never in her life thought of a sick person, turned very sick and looked away from the sufferer; but the your widow, who had spent many and many a night by the death-bed of a man she had loved, and who, tender-hearted, had often tended her sick slaves with her own hand, looked compassionately into the pretty, pain-stricken face of the child, and wiped the dews from his clammy brow.  Katharina shuddered; but her attention was presently attracted to something fresh; from the other side of the house came a clatter of weapons, the door was pushed open, and the physician Philippus walked into the room.  He desired the night-watch, who were with him, to wait outside.  He had come by the command of the police authorities, to whose ears information had been brought that there were persons sick of the plague in the house of Medea, and that she, nevertheless, continued to receive visitors.  It had long been decided that she must be taken in the act of sorcery, and warning had that day been given that she expected illustrious company in the evening.  The watch were to find her red- handed, so to speak; the leech was to prove whether her house was indeed plague-stricken; and in either case the senate wished to have the sorceress safe in prison and at their mercy, though even Philippus had not been taken into their confidence.  The visitors he had come upon were the last he had expected to find here. He looked at them with a disapproving shake of the head, interrupted the woman's voluble asseverations that these noble ladies had come, out of Christian charity, to comfort and help the sick, with a rough exclamation:  \"A pack of lies!\" and at once led the coerced sick nurses out of the house.  He then represented to them the fearful risk to which their folly had exposed them, and insisted very positively on their returning home and, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, taking a bath and putting on fresh garments.  With trembling knees they found their way back to the chariot; but even before it could start Heliodora had broken down in tears, while Katharina, throwing herself back on the cushions, thought, as she glanced at her weeping companion:  \"This is the beginning of the wonderful happiness she was promised!  It is to be hoped it may continue!\"  It seemed indeed as though Katharina's guardian spirit had overheard this amiable wish; for, as the chariot drove past the guard-house into the court-yard of the governor's house, it was stopped by armed men with brown, warlike faces, and they had to wait some minutes till an Arab officer appeared to enquire who they were, and what they wanted.  This they explained in fear and trembling, and they then learnt that the Arab government had that very evening taken possession of the residence. Orion was accused of serious crimes, and his guests were to depart on the following day.  Katharina, who was known to the interpreter, was allowed to go with Heliodora to the senator's wife; she might also use the chariot to return home in, and if she pleased, take the Byzantines with her, for the palace would be in the hands of the soldiery for the next few days.  The two young women held council.  Katharina pressed her friend to come at once to her mother's house, for she felt certain that they were plague-stricken, and how could they procure a bath in a house full of soldiers?  Heliodora could not and must not remain with Martina in this condition, and the senator's wife could follow her next day.  Her mother, she added, would be delighted to welcome so dear a guest.  The widow was passive, and when Martina had gladly consented to accept the invitation of her \"delivering angel,\" the chariot carried them to Susannah's house.  The widow had long been in bed, firmly convinced that her daughter was asleep and dreaming in her own pretty room.  Katharina would not have her disturbed, and the bath-room was so far from Susannah's apartment that she slept on quietly while Katharina and her guest purified themselves.     CHAPTER XI.  The inhabitants of the governor's residence passed a fearful night. Martina asked herself what sin she had committed that she, of all people, should be picked out to witness such a disaster.  And where were her schemes of marriage now?  Any movement in such heat was indeed scarcely endurable; but she would have moved from one part of the house to another a dozen times, and allowed herself to be tossed hither and thither like a ball, if it could have enabled her to save her dear \"great Sesostris\" from such hideous peril.  And at the bottom of all this was, no doubt, this wild, senseless business of the nuns.  And these Arabs!  They simply helped themselves to whatever they fancied, and were, of course, in a position to strip the son of the great Mukaukas of all he possessed and reduce him to beggary.  A pretty business this!  Heliodora, to be sure, had enough for both, and she and her husband would not forget them in their will; but there was more than this in the balance now: it was a matter of life and death.  A cold shudder ran through her at the thought; and her fears were only too well founded: the black Arab who had come to parley with her, and had finally allowed her to remain under this roof till next day, had told her as much through the interpreter.  A fearful, horrible, nameless catastrophe!  And that she should be in the midst of it and have to see it all!  Then her husband, her poor Justinus!  How hard this would fall on him! She could not cease weeping; and before she fell asleep she prayed fervently indeed, to the saints and the dear Mother of God, that they would bring all to a happy issue.  She closed her eyes on the thought: \"What a misfortune!\" and she woke to it again early in the morning.  She, however, had known nothing of the worst horrors of that fatal night.  A troop of Arab soldiers had crossed the Nile at nightfall, some on foot or on horseback and some in boats, led by Obada the Vekeel, and had invested the governor's residence.  When they had fully assured themselves that Orion was indeed absent they took Nilus prisoner. It was then Obada's business to inform the Mukaukas' widow of what had happened, and to tell her that she must quit the house next day.  This must be done, because he had views of his own as to what was to become of the venerable house of the oldest family in the country.  Neforis was still up, and when the interpreter was announced as Obada's forerunner, she was in the fountain-room.  He found her a good deal excited; for, although she was incapable of any consecutive train of thought and, when her mind was required to exert itself, her ideas only came like lightning-flashes through her brain, she had observed that something unusual was going on.  Sebek and her maid had evaded her enquiries, and would say no more than that Amru's representative had come to speak with the young master.  It seemed to be something important, perhaps some false accusation.  The interpreter now explained that Orion himself was accused of having planned and aided an enterprise which had cost the lives of twelve Arab soldiers; and, as she knew, any injury inflicted even on a single Moslem by an Egyptian was punished by death and the confiscation of his goods. Besides this, her son was accused of a robbery.  At the close of this communication, to which Neforis listened with a vacant stare, horrified and at last almost crushed, the interpreter begged that she would grant the Vekeel an audience.  \"Not just yet--give me a few minutes,\" said the widow, bringing out the words with difficulty: first she must have recourse to her secret specific.  When she had done so, she expressed her readiness to see Obada.  Her son's swarthy foe was anxious to appear a mild and magnanimous man in her eyes, so it was with flattering servility and many smirking grins that he communicated to her the necessity for her quitting the house in which she had passed the longest and happiest half of her life, and no later than next day.  To his announcement that her private fortune would remain untouched, and that she would be at liberty to reside in Memphis or to go to her own house in Alexandria, she indifferently replied that \"she should see.\"  She then enquired whether the Arabs had yet succeeded in capturing her son.  \"Not actually,\" replied the Vekeel.  \"But we know where he is hiding, and by to-morrow or the next day we shall lay hands on the unhappy young man.\"  But, as he spoke, the widow detected a malicious gleam in his eyes to which, so far, he had tried to give a sympathetic expression, and she went on with a slight shake of the bead: \"Then it is a case of life and death?\"  \"Compose yourself, noble lady,\" was the reply.  \"Of death alone.\"  Neforis looked up to heaven and for some minutes did not speak; then she asked:  \"And who has accused him of robbery?\"  \"The head of his own Church.....\"  \"Benjamin?\" she murmured with a peculiar smile.  Only yesterday she had made her will in favor of the patriarch and the Church.  \"If Benjamin could see that,\" said she to herself, \"he would change his views of you and your people, and have prayers constantly said for us.\"  As she spoke no more the Vekeel sat looking at her inquisitively and somewhat at a loss, till at length she rose, and with no little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5525"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 09 (#5)"],["body","dismissed him, remarking that now their business was at an end and she had nothing further to say to him.  This closed the interview; and as the Vekeel quitted the fountain-room he muttered to himself: \"What a woman!  Either she is possessed and her brain is crazed, or she is of a rarely heroic pattern.\"  Neforis was supported to her own room; when she was in bed she desired her maid to bring a small box out of her chest and place it on the little table containing medicines by the bead of the couch.  As soon as she was alone she took out two letters which George had written to her before their marriage, and a poem which Orion had once addressed to her; she tried to read them, but the words danced before her eyes, and she was forced to lay them aside.  She took up a little packet containing hair cut from the heads of her sons after death, and a lock of her husband's.  She gazed on these dear memorials with rapt tenderness, and now the poppy juice began to take effect: the images of those departed ones rose clear in her mind, and she was as near to them as though they were standing in living actuality by her side.  Still holding the curls in her hand, she looked up into vacancy, trying to apprehend clearly what had occurred within the last few hours and what lay before her: She must leave this room, this ample couch, this house-- all, in short, that was bound up with the dearest memories of those she had loved.  She was to be forced to this--but did it beseem her to submit to this Negro, this stranger in the house where she was mistress?  She shook her head with a scornful smile; then opening a glass phial, which was still half-full of opium pillules, she placed a few on her tongue and again gazed sky-wards.--Another face now looked down on her; she saw the husband from whom not even death could divide her, and at his feet their two murdered sons.  Presently Orion seemed to rise out of the clouds, as a diver comes up from the water, and make for the shore of the island on which George and the other two seemed to be standing.  His father opened his arms to receive him and clasped him to his heart, while she herself --or was it only her wraith--went to the others, who hurried forward to greet her tenderly; and then her husband, too, met her, and she found rest on his bosom.  For hours, and long before the incursion of the Arabs, she had been feeling half stunned and her mind clouded; but now a delicious, slumberous lethargy came over her, to which her whole being urged her to yield.  But every time her eyes closed, the thought of the morrow shot through her brain, and finally, with a great effort, she sat up, took some water--which was always close at hand--shook into it the remaining pillules in the bottle, and drank it off to the very last drop.  Her hand was steady; the happy smile on her lips, and the eager expression of her eyes, might have led a spectator to believe that she was thirsty and had mixed herself a refreshing draught.  She had no look of a desperate creature laying violent hands on her own life; she felt no hesitancy, no fear of death, no burthen of the guilt she was incurring-- nothing but ecstatic weariness and hope; blissful hope of a life without end, united to those she loved.  Hardly had she swallowed the deadly draught when she shivered with a sudden chill.  Raising herself a little she called her maid, who was sitting up in the adjoining room; and as the woman looked alarmed at her mistress's fixed stare, she stammered out: \"A priest--quick--I am dying.\"  The woman flew off to the viridarium to call Sebek, who was standing in front of the tablinum with the Vekeel; she told him what had happened, and the Negro gave him leave to obey his dying mistress, escorting him as far as the gate.  Just outside, the steward met a deacon who had been giving the blessing of the Church to a poor creature dying of the pestilence, and in a few minutes they were standing by the widow's bed.  The locks of her sons' hair lay by her side; her hands were folded over a crucifix; but her eyes, which had been fixed on the features of the Saviour, had wandered from it and again gazed up to Heaven.  The priest spoke her name, but she mistook him for her son and murmured in loving accents:  \"Orion, poor, poor child!  And you, Mary, my darling, my sweet little pet!  Your father--yes, dear boy, only come with me.--Your father is kind again and forgives you.  All those I loved are together now, and no one-- Who can part us?  Husband--George, listen.  .  .\"  The priest performed his office, but she paid no heed, still staring upwards; her smiling lips continued to move, but no articulate sound came from them.  At last they were still, her eyelids fell, her hands dropped the crucifix, a slight shiver ran through her limbs, which then relaxed, and she opened her mouth as though to draw a deeper breath.  But it closed no more, and when the faithful steward pressed her lips together her face was rigid and her heart had ceased to beat.  The honest man sobbed aloud; when he carried the melancholy news to the Vekeel, Obada growled out a curse, and said to a subaltern officer who was super-intending the loading of his camels with the treasures from the tablinum:  \"I meant to have treated that cursed old woman with conspicuous generosity, and now she has played me this trick; and in Medina they will lay her death at my door, unless. . .\"  But here he broke off; and as he once more watched the loading of the camels, he only thought to himself: \"In playing for such high stake's, a few gold pieces more or less do not count.  A few more heads must fall yet--the handsome Egyptian first and foremost.--If the conspirators at Medina only play their part!  The fall of Omar means that of Amru, and that will set everything right.\"     CHAPTER XII.  Katharina slept little and rose very early, as was her habit, while Heliodora was glad to sleep away the morning hours.  In this scorching season they were, to be sure, the pleasantest of the twenty-four, and the water-wagtail usually found them so; but to-day, though a splendid Indian flower had bloomed for the first time, and the head gardener pointed it out to her with just pride, she could not enjoy it and be glad.  It might perish for aught she cared, and the whole world with it!  There was no one stirring yet in the next garden, but the tall leech Philippus might be seen coming along the road to pay a visit to the women.  A few swift steps carried her to the gate, whence she called him.  She must entreat him to say nothing of her last night's expedition; but before she had time to prefer her request he had paused to tell her that the widow of the Mukaukas, overcome by alarm and horror, had followed her husband to the next world.  There had been a time when Katharina had been devoted to Neforis, regarding her as a second mother; when the governor's residence had seemed to her the epitome of all that was great, venerable, and illustrious; and when she had been proud and happy to be allowed to run in and out, and to be loved like a child of the family.  The tears that started to her eyes were sincere, and it was a relief to her, too, to lay aside the gay and defiantly happy mien which she wore as a mask, while all in her soul was dark, wild, and desperate.  The physician understood her grief; he readily promised not to betray her to any one, and did not blame her, though he again pointed out the danger she had incurred and earnestly insisted that every article of clothing, which she or Heliodora had worn, must be destroyed.  The subtle germ of the malady, he said, clung to everything; every fragment of stuff which had been touched by the plague-stricken was especially fitted to carry the infection and disseminate the disease.  She listened to him in deep alarm, but she could satisfy him on this point; everything she or her companion had worn had been burnt in the bath-room furnace.  The physician went on; and she, heedless of the growing heat, wandered restlessly about the grounds.  Her heart beat with short, quick, painful jerks; an invisible burthen weighed upon her and prevented her breathing freely.  A host of torturing thoughts haunted her unbidden; they were not to be exorcised, and added to her misery: Neforis dead; the residence in the hands of the Arabs; Orion bereft of his possessions and held guilty of a capital crime.  And the peaceful house beyond the hedge--what trouble was hanging over its white-haired master and his guileless wife and daughter?  A storm was gathering, she could see it approaching--and beyond it, like another murky, death-dealing thunder-cloud, was the pestilence, the fearful pestilence.  And it was she, a fragile, feeble girl--a volatile water-wagtail--who had brought all these terrors down on them, who had opened the sluice-gates through which ruin was now beginning to pour in on all around her. She could see the flood surging, swelling--saw it lapping round her own house, her own feet; drops of sweat bedewed her forehead and hands from terror at the mere thought.  And yet, and yet!--If she had really had the power to bind calamity in the clouds, to turn the tide back into its channel, she would not have done so!  The uttermost that she longed for, as the fruit of the seed she had sown and which she longed to see ripen, had not yet come to pass--and to see that she would endure anything, even death and parting from this deceitful, burning, unlovely world.  Death awaited Orion; and before it overtook him he should know who had sharpened the sword.  Perhaps he might escape with his life; but the Arab would not disgorge what he once had seized, and if that young and splendid Croesus should come out of prison alive, but a beggar, then-- then...  And as for Paula!  As for Heliodora!  For once her little hand had wrenched the thunderbolts from Zeus' eagle, and she would find one for them!  The sense of her terrible power, to which more than one victim had"]]]
