I'll look up the General. It may be that I can have you sent North to-day.\"  \"You can do as you please,\" said Clarence, coldly, \"with a--prisoner.\"  The blood rushed to Stephen's face. Bowing to the lady, he strode out of the room. Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street.  \"You're not offended, Brice?\" he said. \"He's sick--and God Almighty, he's proud--I reckon,\" he added with a touch of humility that went straight to Stephen's heart. \"I reckon that some of us are too derned proud--But we ain't cold.\"  Stephen grasped his hand.  \"Offended!\" he said. \"I admire the man. I'll go to the General directly. But just let me thank you. And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet again --as friends.\" \"Hold on, seh,\" said Colonel Catesby Jennison; \"we may as well drink to that.\"  Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to recognize General Sherman.  \"Brice,\" said the General, returning his salute, \"been celebrating this glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Stephen, \"and I came to ask a favor for one of them.\" Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not change, he was emboldened to go on. \"This is one of their colonels, sir. You may have heard of him. He is the man who floated down the river on a log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--\"  \"Good Lord,\" interrupted the General, \"I guess we all heard of him after that. What else has he done to endear himself?\" he asked, with a smile.  \"Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their gunners.\"  \"I'd like to see that man,\" said the General, in his eager way. \"Where is he?\"  \"What I was going to tell you, sir. After he went through all this, he was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner. He's rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can be sent North. I--I know who he is in St. Louis. And I thought that as long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to send him up to-day.\"  \"What's his name?\"  \"Colfax, sir.\"  The General laughed. \"I know the breed,\" said he, \"I'll bet he didn't thank you.\"  \"No, sir, he didn't.\"  \"I like his grit,\" said the General, emphatically, \"These young bloods are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice. They were made for war. They never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting. They ride like the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything. Walker had some of 'em. Crittenden had some. And, good Lord, how they hate a Yankee! I know this Colfax, too. He's a cousin of that fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of. They say he's engaged to her. Be a pity to disappoint her--eh?\"  \"Yes, General.\"  \"Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself! Take my advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.\"  \"I'm glad to do a favor for that young man,\" said the General, when Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him. \"I like to do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can. Did you notice how he flared up when I mentioned the girl?\"  This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St. Louis.     CHAPTER XI  BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE  Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past at Colonel Carvel's house in town. Mrs. Colfax was proud of her table, proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts. How Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them! And when none was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs. Colfax's prattle about the fashions, her tirades against the Yankees.  \"I'm sure he must be dead,\" said that lady, one sultry evening in July. Her tone, however, was not one of conviction. A lazy wind from the river stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown. The girl, with her hand on the wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward, across the Illinois prairie.  \"I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian,\" she replied. \"Bad news travels faster than good.\"  \"And not a word from Comyn. It is cruel of him not to send us a line, telling us where his regiment is.\"  Virginia did not reply. She had long since learned that the wisdom of silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness. Certainly, if Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops, news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River.  \"How was Judge Whipple to-day?\" asked Mrs. Colfax presently.  \"Very weak. He doesn't seem to improve much.\"  \"I can't see why Mrs. Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to her house. Yankee women are such prudes.\"  Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.  \"Mrs. Brice has begged the Judge to come to her. But he says he has lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes.\"  \"How you worship that woman, Virginia! You have become quite a Yankee yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old man.\"  \"The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,\" replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.  Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt. She thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence of the two women. They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night. Worship Margaret Brice! Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital. Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside. The marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in spite of all barriers.  Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he would speak of Stephen. The mother never spoke of her son, but a light would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia to see. And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into slumber, it would still haunt her.  Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs. Brice would turn the Judge from this topic which he seemed to love best? Virginia could not admit to herself that she resented this. She had heard Stephen's letters to the Judge. They came every week. Strong and manly they were, with plenty of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg. Only yesterday Virginia had read one of these to Mr. Whipple, her face burning. Well that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was not there!  \"He says very little about himself,\" Mr. Whipple complained. \"Had it not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on him, and had promoted him. We should never have known of that exploit at Chickasaw Bluff. But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July! I guess we'll make short work of the Rebels now.\"  No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness. He would never change. Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as she repressed a retort. It was not the first time this had happened. At every Union victory Mr. Whipple would loose his tongue. How strange that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!  One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs. Brice had overtaken Virginia on the stairway. Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she must have found repression. Margaret Brice had taken her hand.  \"My dear,\" she had said, \"you are a wonderful woman.\" That was all. But Virginia had driven back to Belle. garde with a strange elation in her heart.  Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was thankful. One was the piano. But she had overheard Shadrach telling old Nancy how Mrs. Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have more room and air. He had been obdurate. And Colonel Carvel's name had never once passed his lips.  Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they toiled against the river's current, while horror held her. Horror lest her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was not yet dead. Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.  Was her bitterness against the North not just? What a life had been Colonel Carvel's! It had dawned brightly. One war had cost him his wife. Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that was dear to him. And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world, he was perchance to see no more.  Mrs. Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed. Still Virginia sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning quivered across the eastern sky. She heard the crunch of wheels in the gravel.  A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell on a closed carriage. A gentleman slowly ascended the steps. Virginia recognized him as Mr. Brinsmade.  \"Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear,\" he said. \"He was among the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant.\"  Virginia gave a little cry and started forward. But he held her hands.  \"He has been wounded!\"  \"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"yes. Oh, tell me, Mr. Brinsmade, tell me--all--\"  \"No, he is not dead, but he is very low. Mr. Russell has been kind enough to come with me.\"  She hurried to call the servants. But they were all there in the light, in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5394"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 07 (#5)"],["body","postures of terror,--Alfred, and Sambo, and Mammy Easter, and Ned. They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy. Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.  There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence hanging between life and death. That his life was saved was due to Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother. Mrs. Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr. Polk. Then her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send for Dr. Brown--which Dr. Polk implored her to do. By spells she wept, when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door. She would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and talk him into a raging fever. But Virginia slept lightly and took the alarm. More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.  By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to Mrs. Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple. By day or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde. And once Dr. Polk, while walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing on her lap. Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down at her!  'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple. Bad news, alas! for he seemed to miss her greatly. He had become more querulous and exacting with patient Mrs. Brice, and inquired for her continually.  She would not go. But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit. Well he knew where to carry them.  What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know. God had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later, when she needed it more, with Clarence. It was she whom he recognized first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments. With the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away. Unless Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose. He put his hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours. Then, and only then, did he seem contented.  The wonder was that her health did not fail. People who saw her during that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled. Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that presence. Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered. A miracle had changed Virginia. Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the effects which people saw. Her force people felt. And this is why we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature. It is God who changes, --who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial. Happy, thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth. And yet how many are there who could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.  Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch in the cool of the afternoon. Then he would watch for hours the tassels stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond, while the two women sat by. At times, when Mrs. Colfax's headaches came on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde, of their friends. Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson. Of love he spoke not a word, and now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand. But often when she looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon her, and a look in them of but one interpretation. She was troubled.  The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon. It was his custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia, his stout frame filling the rocking-chair. Dr. Polk's indulgence was gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr. Cluyme always managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat. It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he would mention Mrs. Brice. Then Clarence would raise his head; and once (she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.  One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined that he had something to tell her. He sat but a few moments, and when he arose to go he took her hand.  \"I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny,\" he said, \"Judge has lost his nurse. Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every day? I shouldn't ask it,\" Dr. Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for him, \"but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to have him excited while in this condition.\"  \"Mrs. Brice is ill?\" she cried. And Clarence, watching, saw her color go.  \"No,\" replied Dr. Polk, \"but her son Stephen has come home from the army. He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded.\" He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued \"It seems that he had no business in the battle. Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon poisoned. Mr. Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,\" added the Doctor, with a sigh, \"General Sherman sent a special physician to the boat with him. He is--\" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying. But he was looking at Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands convulsively clutching at the arms of it. He did not appear to see Virginia.  \"Stephen Brice, did you say?\" he cried, \"will he die?\"  In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for a moment he did not answer. Virginia had taken a step from him, and was standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.  \"Die?\" he said, repeating the word mechanically; \"my God, I hope not. The danger is over, and he is resting easily. If he were not,\" he said quickly and forcibly, \"I should not be here.\"  The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the road. to town that day. And the Doctor's black servant heard his master utter the word \"fool\" twice, and with great emphasis.  For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence gaze upon her before she turned to face him.  \"Virginia!\" He had called her so of late. \"Yes, dear.\"  \"Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you.\"  She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast rising and falling. She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by illness, and she took them in her own.  He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.  \"Virginia, we were children together here. I cannot remember the time when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife. All I did when we played together was to try to win your applause. That was my nature I could not help it. Do you remember the day I climbed out on the rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin? I did not feel the pain. It was because you kissed it and cried over me. You are crying now,\" he said tenderly. \"Don't, Jinny. It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this.  \"I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not brought up seriously,--to be a man. I have been thinking of that day just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here. How well I remember it. It was a purple day. The grapes were purple, and a purple haze was over there across the river. You had been cruel to me. You were grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy. Do you remember the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried to kiss you? You told me I was good for nothing. Please don't interrupt me. It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless, I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you. I had never studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn something,--do something,--become of some account in the world. I am just as useless to day.\"  \"Clarence, after what you have done for the South?\"  He smiled with peculiar bitterness.  \"What have I done for her?\" he added. \"Crossed the river and burned houses. I could not build them again. Floated down the river on a log after a few percussion caps. That did not save Vicksburg.\"  \"And how many had the courage to do that?\" she exclaimed.  \"Pooh,\" he said, \"courage! the whole South has it, Courage! If I did not have that, I would send Sambo to my father's room for his ebony box and blow my brains out. No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune. I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to shirk work. I wanted to go with Walker, you remember. I wanted to go to Kansas. I wanted to distinguish myself,\" he added with a gesture. \"But that is all gone now, Jinny. I wanted to distinguish myself for you. Now I see how an earnest life might have won you. No, I have not done yet.\"  She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly.  \"One day,\" he said, \"one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's office, and a slave auction"]]]
