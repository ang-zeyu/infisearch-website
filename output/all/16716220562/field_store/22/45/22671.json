Rameses demands fresh reinforcements. The pioneer, Paaker, has brought me a letter from our brethren who accompany the king, and delivered a document from him to the Regent, which contains the order to send to him fifty thousand fighting men: and as the whole of the soldier-caste and all the auxiliaries are already under arms, the bondmen of the temple, who till our acres, are to be levied, and sent into Asia.”  A murmur of disapproval arose at these words. The chief of the haruspices stamped his foot, and Gagabu asked:  “What do you mean to do?”  “To prepare to obey the commands of the king,” answered Ameni, “and to call the heads of the temples of the city of Anion here without delay to hold a council. Each must first in his holy of holies seek good counsel of the Celestials. When we have come to a conclusion, we must next win the Viceroy over to our side. Who yesterday assisted at his prayers?”  “It was my turn,” said the chief of the haruspices.  “Follow me to my abode, when the meal is over.” commanded Ameni. “But why is our poet missing from our circle?”  At this moment Pentaur came into the hall, and while he bowed easily and with dignity to the company and low before Ameni, he prayed him to grant that the pastophorus Teta should accompany the leech Nebsecht to visit the daughter of the paraschites.  Ameni nodded consent and exclaimed: “They must make haste. Paaker waits for them at the great gate, and will accompany them in my chariot.”  As soon as Pentaur had left the party of feasters, the old priest from Chennu exclaimed, as he turned to Ameni:  “Indeed, holy father, just such a one and no other had I pictured your poet. He is like the Sun-god, and his demeanor is that of a prince. He is no doubt of noble birth.”  “His father is a homely gardener,” said the highpriest, “who indeed tills the land apportioned to him with industry and prudence, but is of humble birth and rough exterior. He sent Pentaur to the school at an early age, and we have brought up the wonderfully gifted boy to be what he now is.”  “What office does he fill here in the temple?”  “He instructs the elder pupils of the high-school in grammar and eloquence; he is also an excellent observer of the starry heavens, and a most skilled interpreter of dreams,” replied Gagabu. “But here he is again. To whom is Paaker conducting our stammering physician and his assistant?”  “To the daughter of the paraschites, who has been run over,” answered Pentaur. “But what a rough fellow this pioneer is. His voice hurts my ears, and he spoke to our leeches as if they had been his slaves.”  “He was vexed with the commission the princess had devolved on him,”  said the high-priest benevolently, “and his unamiable disposition is hardly mitigated by his real piety.”  “And yet,” said an old priest, “his brother, who left us some years ago, and who had chosen me for his guide and teacher, was a particularly loveable and docile youth.”  “And his father,” said Ameni, “was one of the most superior energetic, and withal subtle-minded of men.”  “Then he has derived his bad peculiarities from his mother?”  “By no means. She is a timid, amiable, soft-hearted woman.”  “But must the child always resemble its parents?” asked Pentaur. “Among the sons of the sacred bull, sometimes not one bears the distinguishing mark of his father.”  “And if Paaker’s father were indeed an Apis,” Gagabu laughing, “according to your view the pioneer himself belongs, alas! to the peasant’s stable.”  Pentaur did not contradict him, but said with a smile:  “Since he left the school bench, where his school-fellows called him the wild ass on account of his unruliness, he has remained always the same. He was stronger than most of them, and yet they knew no greater pleasure than putting him in a rage.”  “Children are so cruel!” said Ameni. “They judge only by appearances, and never enquire into the causes of them. The deficient are as guilty in their eyes as the idle, and Paaker could put forward small claims to their indulgence. I encourage freedom and merriment,” he continued turning to the priests from Cheraw, “among our disciples, for in fettering the fresh enjoyment of youth we lame our best assistant. The excrescences on the natural growth of boys cannot be more surely or painlessly extirpated than in their wild games. The school-boy is the school-boy’s best tutor.”  “But Paaker,” said the priest Meriapu, “was not improved by the provocations of his companions. Constant contests with them increased that roughness which now makes him the terror of his subordinates and alienates all affection.”  “He is the most unhappy of all the many youths, who were intrusted to my care,” said Ameni, “and I believe I know why,--he never had a childlike disposition, even when in years he was still a child, and the Gods had denied him the heavenly gift of good humor. Youth should be modest, and he was assertive from his childhood. He took the sport of his companions for earnest, and his father, who was unwise only as a tutor, encouraged him to resistance instead of to forbearance, in the idea that he thus would be steeled to the hard life of a Mohar.”     [The severe duties of the Mohar are well known from the papyrus of    Anastasi I. in the Brit. Mus., which has been ably treated by F.    Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien.]  “I have often heard the deeds of the Mohar spoken of,” said the old priest from Chennu, “yet I do not exactly know what his office requires of him.”  “He has to wander among the ignorant and insolent people of hostile provinces, and to inform himself of the kind and number of the population, to investigate the direction of the mountains, valleys, and rivers, to set forth his observations, and to deliver them to the house of war,     [Corresponding to our minister of war. A person of the highest    importance even in the earliest times.]  so that the march of the troops may be guided by them.”  “The Mohar then must be equally skilled as a warrior and as a Scribe.”  “As thou sayest; and Paaker’s father was not a hero only, but at the same time a writer, whose close and clear information depicted the country through which he had travelled as plainly as if it were seen from a mountain height. He was the first who took the title of Mohar. The king held him in such high esteem, that he was inferior to no one but the king himself, and the minister of the house of war.”  “Was he of noble race?”  “Of one of the oldest and noblest in the country. His father was the noble warrior Assa,” answered the haruspex, “and he therefore, after he himself had attained the highest consideration and vast wealth, escorted home the niece of the King Hor-em-lieb, who would have had a claim to the throne, as well as the Regent, if the grandfather of the present Rameses had not seized it from the old family by violence.”  “Be careful of your words,” said Ameni, interrupting the rash old man. “Rameses I. was and is the grandfather of our sovereign, and in the king’s veins, from his mother’s side, flows the blood of the legitimate descendants of the Sun-god.”  “But fuller and purer in those of the Regent the haruspex ventured to retort.  “But Rameses wears the crown,” cried Ameni, “and will continue to wear it so long as it pleases the Gods. Reflect--your hairs are grey, and seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind, but which, if they fall, may set our home in a blaze. Continue your feasting, my lords; but I would request you to speak no more this evening of the king and his new decree. You, Pentaur, fulfil my orders to-morrow morning with energy and prudence.”  The high-priest bowed and left the feast.  As soon as the door was shut behind him, the old priest from Chennu spoke.  “What we have learned concerning the pioneer of the king, a man who holds so high an office, surprises me. Does he distinguish himself by a special acuteness?”  “He was a steady learner, but of moderate ability.”  “Is the rank of Mohar then as high as that of a prince of the empire?”  “By no means.”  “How then is it--?”  “It is, as it is,” interrupted Gagabu. “The son of the vine-dresser has his mouth full of grapes, and the child of the door-keeper opens the lock with words.”  “Never mind,” said an old priest who had hitherto kept silence. “Paaker earned for himself the post of Mohar, and possesses many praiseworthy qualities. He is indefatigable and faithful, quails before no danger, and has always been earnestly devout from his boyhood. When the other scholars carried their pocket-money to the fruit-sellers and confectioners at the temple-gates, he would buy geese, and, when his mother sent him a handsome sum, young gazelles, to offer to the Gods on the altars. No noble in the land owns a greater treasure of charms and images of the Gods than he.

Nor could you wonder had you witnessed a recent experience of mine when, in the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance, I gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London.  You would surely have thought that I had been detected in no less a heinous crime than the purloining of the Crown Jewels from the Tower, or putting poison in the coffee of His Majesty the King.  The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed before I was half through!--it is all that saved him from exploding--and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship, gold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into the thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere.  But I believe the story, and so would you, and so would the learned Fellow of the Royal Geological Society, had you and he heard it from the lips of the man who told it to me.  Had you seen, as I did, the fire of truth in those gray eyes; had you felt the ring of sincerity in that quiet voice; had you realized the pathos of it all--you, too, would believe.  You would not have needed the final ocular proof that I had--the weird rhamphorhynchus-like creature which he had brought back with him from the inner world.  I came upon him quite suddenly, and no less unexpectedly, upon the rim of the great Sahara Desert.  He was standing before a goat-skin tent amidst a clump of date palms within a tiny oasis.  Close by was an Arab douar of some eight or ten tents.  I had come down from the north to hunt lion.  My party consisted of a dozen children of the desert--I was the only \"white\" man.  As we approached the little clump of verdure I saw the man come from his tent and with hand-shaded eyes peer intently at us.  At sight of me he advanced rapidly to meet us.  \"A white man!\" he cried.  \"May the good Lord be praised! I have been watching you for hours, hoping against hope that THIS time there would be a white man.  Tell me the date.  What year is it?\"  And when I had told him he staggered as though he had been struck full in the face, so that he was compelled to grasp my stirrup leather for support.  \"It cannot be!\" he cried after a moment.  \"It cannot be!  Tell me that you are mistaken, or that you are but joking.\"  \"I am telling you the truth, my friend,\" I replied.  \"Why should I deceive a stranger, or attempt to, in so simple a matter as the date?\"  For some time he stood in silence, with bowed head.  \"Ten years!\" he murmured, at last.  \"Ten years, and I thought that at the most it could be scarce more than one!\" That night he told me his story--the story that I give you here as nearly in his own words as I can recall them.     I  TOWARD THE ETERNAL FIRES   I was born in Connecticut about thirty years ago.  My name is David Innes.  My father was a wealthy mine owner.  When I was nineteen he died.  All his property was to be mine when I had attained my majority--provided that I had devoted the two years intervening in close application to the great business I was to inherit.  I did my best to fulfil the last wishes of my parent--not because of the inheritance, but because I loved and honored my father.  For six months I toiled in the mines and in the counting-rooms, for I wished to know every minute detail of the business.  Then Perry interested me in his invention.  He was an old fellow who had devoted the better part of a long life to the perfection of a mechanical subterranean prospector.  As relaxation he studied paleontology.  I looked over his plans, listened to his arguments, inspected his working model--and then, convinced, I advanced the funds necessary to construct a full-sized, practical prospector.  I shall not go into the details of its construction--it lies out there in the desert now--about two miles from here.  Tomorrow you may care to ride out and see it.  Roughly, it is a steel cylinder a hundred feet long, and jointed so that it may turn and twist through solid rock if need be.  At one end is a mighty revolving drill operated by an engine which Perry said generated more power to the cubic inch than any other engine did to the cubic foot.  I remember that he used to claim that that invention alone would make us fabulously wealthy--we were going to make the whole thing public after the successful issue of our first secret trial--but Perry never returned from that trial trip, and I only after ten years.  I recall as it were but yesterday the night of that momentous occasion upon which we were to test the practicality of that wondrous invention. It was near midnight when we repaired to the lofty tower in which Perry had constructed his \"iron mole\" as he was wont to call the thing.  The great nose rested upon the bare earth of the floor.  We passed through the doors into the outer jacket, secured them, and then passing on into the cabin, which contained the controlling mechanism within the inner tube, switched on the electric lights.  Perry looked to his generator; to the great tanks that held the life-giving chemicals with which he was to manufacture fresh air to replace that which we consumed in breathing; to his instruments for recording temperatures, speed, distance, and for examining the materials through which we were to pass.  He tested the steering device, and overlooked the mighty cogs which transmitted its marvelous velocity to the giant drill at the nose of his strange craft.  Our seats, into which we strapped ourselves, were so arranged upon transverse bars that we would be upright whether the craft were ploughing her way downward into the bowels of the earth, or running horizontally along some great seam of coal, or rising vertically toward the surface again.  At length all was ready.  Perry bowed his head in prayer.  For a moment we were silent, and then the old man's hand grasped the starting lever. There was a frightful roaring beneath us--the giant frame trembled and vibrated--there was a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up through the hollow space between the inner and outer jackets to be deposited in our wake.  We were off!  The noise was deafening.  The sensation was frightful.  For a full minute neither of us could do aught but cling with the proverbial desperation of the drowning man to the handrails of our swinging seats. Then Perry glanced at the thermometer.  \"Gad!\" he cried, \"it cannot be possible--quick!  What does the distance meter read?\"  That and the speedometer were both on my side of the cabin, and as I turned to take a reading from the former I could see Perry muttering.  \"Ten degrees rise--it cannot be possible!\" and then I saw him tug frantically upon the steering wheel.  As I finally found the tiny needle in the dim light I translated Perry's evident excitement, and my heart sank within me.  But when I spoke I hid the fear which haunted me.  \"It will be seven hundred feet, Perry,\" I said, \"by the time you can turn her into the horizontal.\"  \"You'd better lend me a hand then, my boy,\" he replied, \"for I cannot budge her out of the vertical alone.  God give that our combined strength may be equal to the task, for else we are lost.\"  I wormed my way to the old man's side with never a doubt but that the great wheel would yield on the instant to the power of my young and vigorous muscles.  Nor was my belief mere vanity, for always had my physique been the envy and despair of my fellows.  And for that very reason it had waxed even greater than nature had intended, since my natural pride in my great strength had led me to care for and develop my body and my muscles by every means within my power.  What with boxing, football, and baseball, I had been in training since childhood.  And so it was with the utmost confidence that I laid hold of the huge iron rim; but though I threw every ounce of my strength into it, my best effort was as unavailing as Perry's had been--the thing would not budge--the grim, insensate, horrible thing that was holding us upon the straight road to death!  At length I gave up the useless struggle, and without a word returned to my seat.  There was no need for words--at least none that I could imagine, unless Perry desired to pray.  And I was quite sure that he would, for he never left an opportunity neglected where he might sandwich in a prayer.  He prayed when he arose in the morning, he prayed before he ate, he prayed when he had finished eating, and before he went to bed at night he prayed again.  In between he often found excuses to pray even when the provocation seemed far-fetched to my worldly eyes--now that he was about to die I felt positive that I should witness a perfect orgy of prayer--if one may allude with such a simile to so solemn an act.  But to my astonishment I discovered that with death staring him in the face Abner Perry was transformed into a new being.  From his lips there flowed--not prayer--but a clear and limpid stream of undiluted profanity, and it was all directed at that quietly stubborn piece of unyielding mechanism.  \"I should think, Perry,\" I chided, \"that a man of your professed religiousness would rather be at his prayers than cursing in the presence of imminent death.\"  \"Death!\" he cried.  \"Death is it that appalls you?  That is nothing by comparison with the loss the world must suffer.  Why, David within this iron cylinder we have demonstrated possibilities that science has scarce dreamed.  We have harnessed a new principle, and with it animated a piece of steel with the power of ten thousand men.  That"]]]
