What is common to all men is generally disgustingly similar in the palace and in the hovel.  Mothers are everywhere she-apes, who with pleasure let themselves be tormented to death by their children, who repay them badly enough, and the wives generally open their ears wide if any one can tell them of some misbehavior of their husbands!  But that is not the way with your mistress.\"  The old woman looked thoughtful, and then she continued:  \"In point of fact this can be easily explained, and is not at all more extraordinary than it is that those tired girls should sit yawning.  You told me once that it was a pretty sight to see the mother and daughter side by side in their chariot when they go to a festival or the Panegyrai; Katuti, you said, took care that the colors of their dresses and the flowers in their hair should harmonize.  For which of them is the dress first chosen on such occasions?\"  \"Always for the lady Katuti, who never wears any but certain colors,\" replied Nemu quickly.  \"You see,\" said the witch laughing, \"Indeed it must be so.  That mother always thinks of herself first, and of the objects she wishes to gain; but they hang high, and she treads down everything that is in her way-- even her own child--to reach them.  She will contrive that Paaker shall be the ruin of Mena, as sure as I have ears to hear with, for that woman is capable of playing any tricks with her daughter, and would marry her to that lame dog yonder if it would advance her ambitious schemes.\"  \"But Nefert!\"  said Nemu.  \"You should have seen her.  The dove became a lioness.\"  \"Because she loves Mena as much as her mother loves herself,\" answered Hekt.  \"As the poets say, 'she is full of him.'  It is really true of her, there is no room for any thing else.  She cares for one only, and woe to those who come between him and her!\"  \"I have seen other women in love,\" said Nemu, \"but--\"  \"But,\" exclaimed the old witch with such a sharp laugh that the girls all looked up, \"they behaved differently to Nefert--I believe you, for there is not one in a thousand that loves as she does.  It is a sickness that gives raging pain--like a poisoned arrow in an open wound, and devours all that is near it like a fire-brand, and is harder to cure than the disease which is killing that coughing wench.  To be possessed by that demon of anguish is to suffer the torture of the damned--or else,\" and her voice sank to softness, \"to be more blest than the Gods, happy as they are.  I know--I know it all; for I was once one of the possessed, one of a thousand, and even now--\"  \"Well?\"  asked the dwarf.  \"Folly!\"  muttered the witch, stretching herself as if awaking from sleep.  \"Madness!  He--is long since dead, and if he were not it would be all the same to me.  All men are alike, and Mena will be like the rest.\"  \"But Paaker surely is governed by the demon you describe?\"  asked the dwarf.  \"May be,\" replied his mother; \"but he is self-willed to madness.  He would simply give his life for the thing because it is denied him.  If your mistress Nefert were his, perhaps he might be easier; but what is the use of chattering?  I must go over to the gold tent, where everyone goes now who has any money in their purse, to speak to the mistress--\"  \"What do you want with her?\"  interrupted Nemu.  \"Little Uarda over there,\" said the old woman, \"will soon be quite well again.  You have seen her lately; is she not grown beautiful, wonderfully beautiful?  Now I shall see what the good woman will offer me if I take Uarda to her? the girl is as light-footed as a gazelle, and with good training would learn to dance in a very few weeks.\"  Nemu turned perfectly white.  \"That you shall not do,\" said he positively.  \"And why not?\"  asked the old woman, \"if it pays well.\"  \"Because I forbid it,\" said the dwarf in a choked voice.  \"Bless me,\" laughed the woman; \"you want to play my lady Nefert, and expect me to take the part of her mother Katuti.  But, seriously, having seen the child again, have you any fancy for her?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Nemu.  \"If we gain our end, Katuti will make me free, and make me rich.  Then I will buy Pinem's grandchild, and take her for my wife.  I will build a house near the hall of justice, and give the complainants and defendants private advice, like the hunch-back Sent, who now drives through the streets in his own chariot.\"  \"Hm--\" said his mother, \"that might have done very well, but perhaps it is too late.  When the child had fever she talked about the young priest who was sent from the House of Seti by Ameni.  He is a fine tall fellow, and took a great interest in her; he is a gardener's son, named Pentaur.\"  \"Pentaur?\"  said the dwarf.  \"Pentaur?  He has the haughty air and the expression of the old Mohar, and would be sure to rise; but they are going to break his proud neck for him.\"  \"So much the better,\" said the old woman.  \"Uarda would be just the wife for you, she is good and steady, and no one knows--\"  \"What?\"  said Nemu.  \"Who her mother was--for she was not one of us.  She came here from foreign parts, and when she died she left a trinket with strange letters on it.  We must show it to one of the prisoners of war, after you have got her safe; perhaps they could make out the queer inscription.  She comes of a good stock, that I am certain; for Uarda is the very living image of her mother, and as soon as she was born, she looked like the child of a great man.  You smile, you idiot!  Why thousands of infants have been in my hands, and if one was brought to me wrapped in rags I could tell if its parents were noble or base-born.  The shape of the foot shows it--and other marks.  Uarda may stay where she is, and I will help you.  If anything new occurs let me know.\"    CHAPTER XXI.  When Nemu, riding on an ass this time, reached home, he found neither his mistress nor Nefert within.  The former was gone, first to the temple, and then into the town; Nefert, obeying an irresistible impulse, had gone to her royal friend Bent-Anat.  The king's palace was more like a little town than a house.  The wing in which the Regent resided, and which we have already visited, lay away from the river; while the part of the building which was used by the royal family commanded the Nile.  It offered a splendid, and at the same time a pleasing prospect to the ships which sailed by at its foot, for it stood, not a huge and solitary mass in the midst of the surrounding gardens, but in picturesque groups of various outline.  On each side of a large structure, which contained the state rooms and banqueting hall, three rows of pavilions of different sizes extended in symmetrical order.  They were connected with each other by colonnades, or by little bridges, under which flowed canals, that watered the gardens and gave the palace-grounds the aspect of a town built on islands.  The principal part of the castle of the Pharaohs was constructed of light Nile-mud bricks and elegantly carved woodwork, but the extensive walls which surrounded it were ornamented and fortified with towers, in front of which heavily armed soldiers stood on guard.  The walls and pillars, the galleries and colonnades, even the roofs, blazed in many colored paints, and at every gate stood tall masts, from which red and blue flags fluttered when the king was residing there.  Now they stood up with only their brass spikes, which were intended to intercept and conduct the lightning.--[ According to an inscription first interpreted by Dumichen.]  To the right of the principal building, and entirely surrounded with thick plantations of trees, stood the houses of the royal ladies, some mirrored in the lake which they surrounded at a greater or less distance. In this part of the grounds were the king's storehouses in endless rows, while behind the centre building, in which the Pharaoh resided, stood the barracks for his body guard and the treasuries.  The left wing was occupied by the officers of the household, the innumerable servants and the horses and chariots of the sovereign.  In spite of the absence of the king himself, brisk activity reigned in the palace of Rameses, for a hundred gardeners watered the turf, the flower-borders, the shrubs and trees; companies of guards passed hither and thither; horses were being trained and broken; and the princess's wing was as full as a beehive of servants and maids, officers and priests.  Nefert was well known in this part of the palace.  The gate-keepers let her litter pass unchallenged, with low bows; once in the garden, a lord in waiting received her, and conducted her to the chamberlain, who, after a short delay, introduced her into the sitting-room of the king's favorite daughter.  Bent-Anat's apartment was on the first floor of the pavilion, next to the king's residence.  Her dead mother had inhabited these pleasant rooms, and when the princess was grown up it made the king happy to feel that she was near him; so the beautiful house of the wife who had too early departed, was given up to her, and at the same time, as she was his eldest daughter, many privileges were conceded to her, which hitherto none but queens had enjoyed.  The large room, in which Nefert found the princess, commanded the river. A doorway, closed with light curtains, opened on to a long balcony with a finely-worked balustrade of copper-gilt, to which clung a climbing rose with pink flowers.  When Nefert entered the room, Bent-Anat was just having the rustling curtain drawn aside by her waiting-women; for the sun was setting, and at that hour she loved to sit on the balcony, as it grew cooler, and watch with devout meditation the departure of Ra, who, as the grey-haired Turn, vanished behind the western horizon of the Necropolis in the evening to bestow the blessing of light on the under-world.  Nefert's apartment was far more elegantly appointed than the princess's; her mother and Mena had surrounded her with a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5443"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","pretty trifles. Her carpets were made of sky-blue and silver brocade from Damascus, the seats and couches were covered with stuff embroidered in feathers by the Ethiopian women, which looked like the breasts of birds.  The images of the Goddess Hathor, which stood on the house-altar, were of an imitation of emerald, which was called Mafkat, and the other little figures, which were placed near their patroness, were of lapis-lazuli, malachite, agate and bronze, overlaid with gold.  On her toilet-table stood a collection of salve-boxes, and cups of ebony and ivory finely carved, and everything was arranged with the utmost taste, and exactly suited Nefert herself.  Bent-Anat's room also suited the owner.  It was high and airy, and its furniture consisted in costly but simple necessaries; the lower part of the wall was lined with cool tiles of white and violet earthen ware, on each of which was pictured a star, and which, all together, formed a tasteful pattern.  Above these the walls were covered with a beautiful dark green material brought from Sais, and the same stuff was used to cover the long divans by the wall.  Chairs and stools, made of cane, stood round a very large table in the middle of this room, out of which several others opened; all handsome, comfortable, and harmonious in aspect, but all betraying that their mistress took small pleasure in trifling decorations.  But her chief delight was in finely-grown plants, of which rare and magnificent specimens, artistically arranged on stands, stood in the corners of many of the rooms.  In others there were tall obelisks of ebony, which bore saucers for incense, which all the Egyptians loved, and which was prescribed by their physicians to purify and perfume their dwellings.  Her simple bedroom would have suited a prince who loved floriculture, quite as well as a princess.  Before all things Bent-Anat loved air and light.  The curtains of her windows and doors were only closed when the position of the sun absolutely required it; while in Nefert's rooms, from morning till evening, a dim twilight was maintained.  The princess went affectionately towards the charioteer's wife, who bowed low before her at the threshold; she took her chin with her right hand, kissed her delicate narrow forehead, and said:  \"Sweet creature!  At last you have come uninvited to see lonely me! It is the first time since our men went away to the war.  If Rameses' daughter commands there is no escape; and you come; but of your own free will--\"  Nefert raised her large eyes, moist with tears, with an imploring look, and her glance was so pathetic that Bent-Anat interrupted herself, and taking both her hands, exclaimed:  \"Do you know who must have eyes exactly like yours?  I mean the Goddess from whose tears, when they fall on the earth, flowers spring.\"  Nefert's eyes fell and she blushed deeply.  \"I wish,\" she murmured, \"that my eyes might close for ever, for I am very unhappy.\"  And two large tears rolled down her cheeks.  \"What has happened to you, my darling?\"  asked the princess sympathetically, and she drew her towards her, putting her arm round her like a sick child.  Nefert glanced anxiously at the chamberlain, and the ladies in waiting who had entered the room with her, and Bent-Anat understood the look; she requested her attendants to withdraw, and when she was alone with her sad little friend--\"Speak now,\" she said.  \"What saddens your heart?  how comes this melancholy expression on your dear baby face?  Tell me, and I will comfort you, and you shall be my bright thoughtless plaything once more.\"  \"Thy plaything!\" answered Nefert, and a flash of displeasure sparkled in her eyes.  \"Thou art right to call me so, for I deserve no better name. I have submitted all my life to be nothing but the plaything of others.\"  \"But, Nefert, I do not know you again,\" cried Bent-Anat.  \"Is this my gentle amiable dreamer?\"  \"That is the word I wanted,\" said Nefert in a low tone.  \"I slept, and dreamed, and dreamed on--till Mena awoke me; and when he left me I went to sleep again, and for two whole years I have lain dreaming; but to-day I have been torn from my dreams so suddenly and roughly, that I shall never find any rest again.\"  While she spoke, heavy tears fell slowly one after another over her cheeks.  Bent-Anat felt what she saw and heard as deeply as if Nefert were her own suffering child.  She lovingly drew the young wife down by her side on the divan, and insisted on Nefert's letting her know all that troubled her spirit.  Katuti's daughter had in the last few hours felt like one born blind, and who suddenly receives his sight.  He looks at the brightness of the sun, and the manifold forms of the creation around him, but the beams of the day-star blind its eyes, and the new forms, which he has sought to guess at in his mind, and which throng round him in their rude reality, shock him and pain him.  To-day, for the first time, she had asked herself wherefore her mother, and not she herself, was called upon to control the house of which she nevertheless was called the mistress, and the answer had rung in her ears: \"Because Mena thinks you incapable of thought and action.\"  He had often called her his little rose, and she felt now that she was neither more nor less than a flower that blossoms and fades, and only charms the eye by its color and beauty.  \"My mother,\" she said to Bent-Anat, \"no doubt loves me, but she has managed badly for Mena, very badly; and I, miserable idiot, slept and dreamed of Mena, and saw and heard nothing of what was happening to his --to our--inheritance.  Now my mother is afraid of my husband, and those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love, and we are always ready to believe evil of those we do not love.  So she lends an ear to those people who blame Mena, and say of him that he has driven me out of his heart, and has taken a strange woman to his tent.  But it is false and a lie; and I cannot and will not countenance my own mother even, if she embitters and mars what is left to me--what supports me--the breath and blood of my life--my love, my fervent love for my husband.\"  Bent-Anat had listened to her without interrupting her; she sat by her for a time in silence.  Then she said:  \"Come out into the gallery; then I will tell you what I think, and perhaps Toth may pour some helpful counsel into my mind.  I love you, and I know you well, and though I am not wise, I have my eyes open and a strong hand.  Take it, come with me on to the balcony.\"  A refreshing breeze met the two women as they stepped out into the air. It was evening, and a reviving coolness had succeeded the heat of the day.  The buildings and houses already cast long shadows, and numberless boats, with the visitors returning from the Necropolis, crowded the stream that rolled its swollen flood majestically northwards.  Close below lay the verdant garden, which sent odors from the rose-beds up to the princess's balcony.  A famous artist had laid it out in the time of Hatasu, and the picture which he had in his mind, when he sowed the seeds and planted the young shoots, was now realized, many decades after his death.  He had thought of planning a carpet, on which the palace should seem to stand.  Tiny streams, in bends and curves, formed the outline of the design, and the shapes they enclosed were filled with plants of every size, form, and color; beautiful plats of fresh green turf everywhere represented the groundwork of the pattern, and flower- beds and clumps of shrubs stood out from them in harmonious mixtures of colors, while the tall and rare trees, of which Hatasu's ships had brought several from Arabia, gave dignity and impressiveness to the whole.  Clear drops sparkled on leaf and flower and blade, for, only a short time before, the garden by Bent-Anat's house had been freshly watered.  The Nile beyond surrounded an island, where flourished the well-kept sacred grove of Anion.  The Necropolis on the farther side of the river was also well seen from Bent-Anat's balcony.  There stood in long perspective the rows of sphinxes, which led from the landing-place of the festal barges to the gigantic buildings of Amenophis III. with its colossi--the hugest in Thebes--to the House of Seti, and to the temple of Hatasu.  There lay the long workshops of the embalmers and closely-packed homes of the inhabitants of the City of the Dead.  In the farthest west rose the Libyan mountains with their innumerable graves, and the valley of the kings' tombs took a wide curve behind, concealed by a spur of the hills.  The two women looked in silence towards the west.  The sun was near the horizon--now it touched it, now it sank behind the hills; and as the heavens flushed with hues like living gold, blazing rubies, and liquid garnet and amethyst, the evening chant rang out from all the temples, and the friends sank on their knees, hid their faces in the bower-rose garlands that clung to the trellis, and prayed with full hearts.  When they rose night was spreading over the landscape, for the twilight is short in Thebes.  Here and there a rosy cloud fluttered across the darkening sky, and faded gradually as the evening star appeared.  \"I am content,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"And you?  have you recovered your peace of mind?\"  Nefert shook her head.  The princess drew her on to a seat, and sank down beside her.  Then she began again \"Your heart is sore, poor child; they have spoilt the past for you, and you dread the future.  Let me be frank with you, even if it gives you pain.  You are sick, and I must cure you. Will you listen to me?\"  \"Speak on,\" said Nefert.  \"Speech does not suit me so well as action,\" replied the princess; \"but I believe I know what you need, and can help you.  You love your husband; duty calls him from you, and you feel lonely and neglected; that is quite natural.  But those whom I love, my father and my brothers, are also gone to the war; my mother is long since dead; the noble woman,"]]]
