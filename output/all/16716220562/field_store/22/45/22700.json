For this permission we will call down the blessing of God upon thine head and his curse upon thine enemies.\"  \"Grant unto my brethren the permission to build their temple!\"  added Belteshazzar, who was the richest and most honorable and respected of the Jews yet remaining in Babylon; a man whom Cyrus had treated with much consideration, and of whom he had even taken counsel from time to time.  \"Will ye then be peaceable, if I grant your petition?\"  asked the king. \"My father allowed you to begin the work and granted the means for its completion.  Of one mind, happy and content, ye returned to your native land, but while pursuing your work strife and contention entered among you.  Cyrus was assailed by repeated letters, signed by the chief men of Syria, entreating him to forbid the work, and I also have been lately besought to do the same.  Worship your God when and where ye will, but just because I desire your welfare, I cannot consent to the prosecution of a work which kindles discord among you.\"  \"And is it then thy pleasure on this day to take back a favor, which thy father made sure unto us by a written decree?\"  asked Belteshazzar.  \"A written decree?\"  \"Which will surely be found even to this day laid up in the archives of thy kingdom.\"  \"Find this decree and show it me, and I will not only allow the building to be continued, but will promote the same,\" answered the king; \"for my father's will is as sacred to me as the commands of the gods.\"  \"Wilt thou allow search to be made in the house of the rolls at Ecbatana?\"  asked Belteshazzar.  \"The decree will surely be found there.\"  \"I consent, but I fear ye will find none.  Tell thy nation, priest, that I am content with the equipment of the men of war they have sent to take the field against the Massagetae.  My general Megabyzus commends their looks and bearing.  May thy people prove as valiant now as in the wars of my father!  You, Belteshazzar, I bid to my marriage feast, and charge you to tell your fellows, Meshach and Abednego, next unto you the highest in the city of Babylon, that I expect them this evening at my table.\"  \"The God of my people Israel grant thee blessing and happiness,\" answered Belteshazzar bowing low before the king.  \"A wish which I accept!\"  answered the king, \"for I do not despise the power of your wonder-working great Spirit.  But one word more, Belteshazzar.  Many Jews have lately been punished for reviling the gods of the Babylonians.  Warn your people!  They bring down hatred on themselves by their stiff-necked superstition, and the pride with which they declare their own great spirit to be the only true God.  Take example by us; we are content with our own faith and leave others to enjoy theirs in peace.  Cease to look upon yourselves as better than the rest of the world.  I wish you well, for a pride founded on self-respect is pleasing in mine eyes; but take heed lest pride degenerate into vainglory.  Farewell!  rest assured of my favor.\"  The Jews then departed.  They were disappointed, but not hopeless; for Belteshazzar knew well that the decree, relative to the building of the temple, must be in the archives at Ecbatana.  They were followed by a deputation from Syria, and by the Greeks of Ionia; and then, winding up the long train, appeared a band of wild- looking men, dressed in the skins of animals, whose features bespoke them foreigners in Babylon.  They wore girdles and shoulderbands of solid, unwrought gold; and of the same precious metal were their bow-cases, axes, lance-points, and the ornaments on their high fur caps.  They were preceded by a man in Persian dress, whose features proved him, however, to be of the same race as his followers.  The king gazed at first on these envoys with wonder; then his brow darkened, and beckoning the officer whose duty it was to present strangers, he exclaimed \"What can these men have to crave of me?  If I mistake not they belong to the Massagetae, to that people who are so soon to tremble before my vengeance.  Tell them, Gobryas, that an armed host is standing on the Median plains ready to answer their demands with the sword.\"  Gobryas answered, bowing low: \"These men arrived this morning during the sacrifice bringing huge burdens of the purest gold to purchase your forbearance.  When they heard that a great festival was being celebrated in your honor, they urgently besought to be admitted into your presence, that they might declare the message entrusted to them by their country.\"  The king's brow cleared and, after sharply scrutinizing the tall, bearded Massageta:, he said: \"Let them come nearer.  I am curious to know what proposals my father's murderers are about to make me.\"  Gobryas made a sign, and the tallest and eldest of the Massagetae came up close to the throne and began to speak loudly in his native tongue.  He was accompanied by the man in a Persian dress, who, as one of Cyrus' prisoners of war, had learnt the Persian language, and now interpreted one by one the sentences uttered by the spokesman of this wandering tribe.  \"We know,\" began the latter, \"that thou, great king, art wroth with the Massagetae because thy father fell in war with our tribe--a war which he alone had provoked with a people who had done naught to offend him.\"  \"My father was justified in punishing your nation,\" interrupted the king. \"Your Queen Tomyris had dared to refuse him her hand in marriage.\"  \"Be not wroth, O King,\" answered the Massagetan, \"when I tell thee that our entire nation approved of that act.  Even a child could see that the great Cyrus only desired to add our queen to the number of his wives, hoping, in his insatiable thirst for more territories, to gain our land with her.\"  Cambyses was silent and the envoy went on.  \"Cyrus caused a bridge to be made over our boundary river, the Araxes.  We were not dismayed at this, and Tomyris sent word that he might save himself this trouble, for that the Massagetae were willing either to await him quietly in their own land, leaving the passage of the river free, or to meet him in his. Cyrus decided, by the advice of the dethroned king of Lydia, (as we learnt afterwards, through some prisoners of war) on meeting us in our own land and defeating us by a stratagem.  With this intention he sent at first only a small body of troops, which could be easily dispersed and destroyed by our arrows and lances, and allowed us to seize his camp without striking a blow.  Believing we had defeated this insatiable conqueror, we feasted on his abundant stores, and, poisoned by the sweet unknown drink which you call wine, fell into a stupefied slumber, during which his soldiers fell upon us, murdered the greater number of our warriors and took many captives.  Among the latter was the brave, young Spargapises, our queen's son.  \"Hearing in his captivity, that his mother was willing to conclude peace with your nation as the price of his liberty, he asked to have his chains taken off.  The request was granted, and on obtaining the use of his hands he seized a sword and stabbed himself, exclaiming: 'I sacrifice my life for the freedom of my nation.'\"  \"No sooner did we hear the news that the young prince we loved so well had died thus, than we assembled all the forces yet left to us from your swords and fetters.  Even old men and boys flew to arms to revenge our noble Spargapises, and sacrifice themselves, after his example, for Massagetaen freedom.  Our armies met; ye were worsted and Cyrus fell. When Tomyris found his body lying in a pool of human blood, she cried: 'Methinks, insatiable conqueror, thou art at last sated with blood!' The troop, composed of the flower of your nobility, which you call the Immortals, drove us back and carried your father's dead body forth from our closest ranks.  You led them on, fighting like a lion.  I know you well, and that wound across your manly face, which adorns it like a purple badge of honor, was made by the sword now hanging at my side.\"  A movement passed through the listening crowd; they trembled for the bold speaker's life.  Cambyses, however, looked pleased, nodded approvingly to the man and answered: \"Yes, I recognize you too now; you rode a red horse with golden trappings.  You shall see that the Persians know how to honor courage.  Bow down before this man, my friends, for never did I see a sharper sword nor a more unwearied arm than his; and such heroic courage deserves honor from the brave, whether shown by friend or foe.  As for you, Massagetae, I would advise you to go home quickly and prepare for war; the mere recollection of your strength and courage increases my longing to test it once more.  A brave foe, by Mithras, is far better than a feeble friend.  You shall be allowed to return home in peace; but beware of remaining too long within my reach, lest the thought of the vengeance I owe my father's soul should rouse my anger, and your end draw suddenly nigh.\"  A bitter smile played round the bearded mouth of the warrior as he made answer to this speech.  \"The Massagetae deem your father's soul too well avenged already.  The only son of our queen, his people's pride, and in no way inferior to Cyrus, has bled for him.  The shores of the Araxes have been fertilized by the bodies of fifty thousand of my countrymen, slain as offerings for your dead king, while only thirty thousand fell there on your own side.  We fought as bravely as you, but your armor is better able to resist the arrows which pierce our clothing of skins.  And lastly, as the most cruel blow of all, ye slew our queen.\"  \"Tomyris is dead?\"  exclaimed Cambyses interrupting him.  \"You mean to tell me that the Persians have killed a woman?  Answer at once, what has happened to your queen?\"  \"Tomyris died ten months ago of grief for the loss of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 05 (#4)"],["body","only son, and I have therefore a right to say that she too fell a sacrifice to the war with Persia and to your father's spirit.\"  \"She was a great woman,\" murmured Cambyses, his voice unsteady from emotion.  \"Verily, I begin to think that the gods themselves have undertaken to revenge my father's blood on your nation.  Yet I tell you that, heavy as your losses may seem, Spargapises, Tomyris and fifty thousand Massagetae can never outweigh the spirit of one king of Persia, least of all of a Cyrus.\"  \"In our country,\" answered the envoy, \"death makes all men equal.  The spirits of the king and the slave are of equal worth.  Your father was a great man, but we have undergone awful sufferings for his sake.  My tale is not yet ended.  After the death of Tomyris discord broke out among the Massagetae.  Two claimants for the crown appeared; half our nation fought for the one, half for the other, and our hosts were thinned, first by this fearful civil war and then by the pestilence which followed in its track.  We can no longer resist your power, and therefore come with heavy loads of pure gold as the price of peace.\"  \"Ye submit then without striking a blow?\"  asked Cambyses.  \"Verily, I had expected something else from such heroes; the numbers of my host, which waits assembled on the plains of Media, will prove that.  We cannot go to battle without an enemy.  I will dismiss my troops and send a satrap.  Be welcome as new subjects of my realm.\"  The red blood mounted into the cheeks of the Massagetan warrior on hearing these words, and he answered in a voice trembling with excitement: \"You err, O King, if you imagine that we have lost our old courage, or learnt to long for slavery.  But we know your strength; we know that the small remnant of our nation, which war and pestilence have spared, cannot resist your vast and well-armed hosts.  This we admit, freely and honestly as is the manner of the Massagetae, declaring however at the same time, that we are determined to govern ourselves as of yore, and will never receive laws or ordinances from a Persian satrap.  You are wroth, but I can bear your angry gaze and yet repeat my declaration.\"  \"And my answer,\" cried Cambyses, \"is this: Ye have but one choice: either to submit to my sceptre, become united to the kingdom of Persia under the name of the Massagetan province, and receive a satrap as my representative with due reverence, or to look upon yourselves as my enemies, in which case you will be forced by arms to conform to those conditions which I now offer you in good part.  To-day you could secure a ruler well-affected to your cause, later you will find in me only a conqueror and avenger.  Consider well before you answer.\"  \"We have already weighed and considered all,\" answered the warrior, \"and, as free sons of the desert, prefer death to bondage.  Hear what the council of our old men has sent me to declare to you:--The Massageta; have become too weak to oppose the Persians, not through their own fault, but through the heavy visitation of our god, the sun.  We know that you have armed a vast host against us, and we are ready to buy peace and liberty by a yearly tribute.  But if you persist in compelling us to submit by force of arms, you can only bring great damage on yourselves. The moment your army nears the Araxes, we shall depart with our wives and children and seek another home, for we have no fixed dwellings like yours, but are accustomed to rove at will on our swift horses, and to rest in tents.  Our gold we shall take with us, and shall fill up, destroy, and conceal the pits in which you could find new treasures.  We know every spot where gold is to be found, and can give it in abundance, if you grant us peace and leave us our liberty; but, if you venture to invade our territory, you win nothing but an empty desert and an enemy always beyond your reach,--an enemy who may become formidable, when he has had time to recover from the heavy losses which have thinned his ranks.  Leave us in peace and freedom and we are ready to give every year five thousand swift horses of the desert, besides the yearly tribute of gold; we will also come to the help of the Persian nation when threatened by any serious danger.\"  The envoy ceased speaking.  Cambyses did not answer at once; his eyes were fixed on the ground in deep thought.  At last he said, rising at the same time from his throne: \"We will take counsel on this matter over the wine to-night, and to-morrow you shall hear what answer you can bring to your people.  Gobryas, see that these men are well cared for, and send the Massagetan, who wounded me in battle, a portion of the best dishes from my own table.\"     CHAPTER XV.  During these events Nitetis had been sitting alone in her house on the hanging-gardens, absorbed in the saddest thoughts.  To-day, for the first time, she had taken part in the general sacrifice made by the king's wives, and had tried to pray to her new gods in the open air, before the fire-altars and amidst the sound of religious songs strange to her ears.  Most of the inhabitants of the harem saw her to-day for the first time, and instead of raising their eyes to heaven, had fixed them on her during the ceremony.  The inquisitive, malevolent gaze of her rivals, and the loud music resounding from the city, disquieted and distracted her mind. Her thoughts reverted painfully to the solemn, sultry stillness of the gigantic temples in her native land where she had worshipped the gods of her childhood so earnestly at the side of her mother and sister; and much as she longed, just on this day, to pray for blessings on her beloved king, all her efforts were in vain; she could arouse no devotional feeling.  Kassandane and Atossa knelt at her side, joining heartily in the very hymns which to Nitetis were an empty sound.  It cannot be denied, that many parts of these hymns contain true poetry; but they become wearisome through the constant repetition and invocation of the names of good and bad spirits.  The Persian women had been taught from childhood, to look upon these religious songs as higher and holier than any other poetry.  Their earliest prayers had been accompanied by such hymns, and, like everything else which has come down to us from our fathers, and which we have been told in the impressionable time of childhood is divine and worthy of our reverence, they were still sacred and dear to them and stirred their most devotional feelings.  But for Nitetis, who had been spoilt for such things by an intimate acquaintance with the best Greek poets, they could have but little charm. What she had lately been learning in Persia with difficulty had not yet become a part of herself, and so, while Kassandane and Atossa went through all the outward rites as things of course and perfectly natural to them, Nitetis could only prevent herself from forgetting the prescribed ceremonials by a great mental effort, and dreaded lest she should expose her ignorance to the jealous, watchful gaze of her rivals.  And then, too, only a few minutes before the sacrifice, she had received her first letter from Egypt.  It lay unread on her dressing-table, and came into her mind whenever she attempted to pray.  She could not help wondering what news it might bring her.  How were her parents?  and how had Tachot borne the parting from herself, and from the prince she loved so well?  The ceremony over, Nitetis embraced Kassandane and Atossa, and drew a long, deep breath, as if delivered from some threatening danger.  Then ordering her litter, she was carried back to her dwelling, and hastened eagerly to the table where her letter lay.  Her principal attendant, the young girl who on the journey had dressed her in her first Persian robes, received her with a smile full of meaning and promise, which changed however, into a look of astonishment, on seeing her mistress seize the letter, without even glancing at the articles of dress and jewelery which lay on the table.  Nitetis broke the seal quickly and was sitting down, in order to begin the difficult work of reading her letter, when the girl came up, and with clasped hands, exclaimed: \"By Mithras, my mistress, I cannot understand you.  Either you are ill, or that ugly bit of grey stuff must contain some magic which makes you blind to everything else.  Put that roll away and look at the splendid presents that the great king (Auramazda grant him victory!) has sent while you were at the sacrifice.  Look at this wonderful purple robe with the white stripe and the rich silver embroidery; and then the tiara with the royal diamonds!  Do not you know the high meaning of these gifts?  Cambyses begs, (the messenger said 'begs,' not 'commands') you to wear these splendid ornaments at the banquet to-day.  How angry Phaedime will be! and how the others will look, for they have never received such presents.  Till now only Kassandane has had a right to wear the purple and diamonds; so by sending you these gifts, Cambyses places you on a level with his mother, and chooses you to be his favorite wife before the whole world.'  O pray allow me to dress you in these new and beautiful things.  How lovely you will look!  How angry and envious the others will feel!  If I could only be there when you enter the hall!  Come, my mistress, let me take off your simple dress, and array you, (only as a trial you know,) in the robes that as the new queen you ought to wear.\"  Nitetis listened in silence to the chattering girl, and admired the gifts with a quiet smile.  She was woman enough to rejoice at the sight, for he, whom she loved better than life itself, had sent them; and they were a proof that she was more to the king than all his other wives;--that Cambyses really loved her.  The long wished-for letter fell unread to the ground, the girl's wish to dress her was granted without a word, and in a short time the splendid toilette was completed.  The royal purple added to her beauty, the high flashing"]]]
