D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 2.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 10.   CHAPTER XIII.  The waters of the Nile had begun to rise again.  Two months had passed away since Phanes' disappearance, and much had happened.  The very day on which he left Egypt, Sappho had given birth to a girl, and had so far regained strength since then under the care of her grandmother, as to be able to join in an excursion up the Nile, which Croesus had suggested should take place on the festival of the goddess Neith.  Since the departure of Phanes, Cambyses' behavior had become so intolerable, that Bartja, with the permission of his brother, had taken Sappho to live in the royal palace at Memphis, in order to escape any painful collision.  Rhodopis, at whose house Croesus and his son, Bartja, Darius and Zopyrus were constant guests, had agreed to join the party.  On the morning of the festival-day they started in a gorgeously decorated boat, from a point between thirty and forty miles below Memphis, favored by a good north-wind and urged rapidly forward by a large number of rowers.  A wooden roof or canopy, gilded and brightly painted, sheltered them from the sun.  Croesus sat by Rhodopis, Theopompus the Milesian lay at her feet.  Sappho was leaning against Bartja.  Syloson, the brother of Polykrates, had made himself a comfortable resting-place next to Darius, who was looking thought fully into the water.  Gyges and Zopyrus busied themselves in making wreaths for the women, from the flowers handed them by an Egyptian slave.  \"It seems hardly possible,\" said Bartja, \"that we can be rowing against the stream.  The boat flies like a swallow.\"  \"This fresh north-wind brings us forward,\" answered Theopompus.  \"And then the Egyptian boatmen understand their work splendidly.\"  \"And row all the better just because we are sailing against the stream,\" added Croesus.  \"Resistance always brings out a man's best powers.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rhodopis, \"sometimes we even make difficulties, if the river of life seems too smooth.\"  \"True,\" answered Darius.  \"A noble mind can never swim with the stream. In quiet inactivity all men are equal.  We must be seen fighting, to be rightly estimated.\"  \"Such noble-minded champions must be very cautious,  though,\" said Rhodopis, \"lest  they become contentious, and  quarrelsome.  Do you see those melons lying on the black soil yonder, like golden balls?  Not one would have come to perfection if the sower had been too lavish with his seed.  The fruit would have been choked by too luxuriant tendrils and leaves.  Man is born to struggle and to work, but in this, as in everything else, he must know how to be moderate if his efforts are to succeed.  The art of true wisdom is to keep within limits.\"  \"Oh, if Cambyses could only hear you!\"  exclaimed Croesus.  \"Instead of being contented with his immense conquests, and now thinking for the welfare of his subjects, he has all sorts of distant plans in his head. He wishes to conquer the entire world, and yet, since Phanes left, scarcely a day has passed in which he has not been conquered himself by the Div of drunkenness.\"  \"Has his mother no influence over him?\"  asked Rhodopis.  \"She is a noble woman.\"  \"She could not even move his resolution to marry Atossa, and was forced to be present at the marriage feast.\"  \"Poor Atossa!\" murmured Sappho.  \"She does not pass a very happy life as Queen of Persia,\" answered Croesus; \"and her own naturally impetuous disposition makes it all the more difficult or her to live contentedly with this husband and mother; I am sorry to hear it said that Cambyses neglects her sadly, and treats her like a child.  But the marriage does not seem to have astonished the Egyptians, as brothers and sisters often marry here.\"  \"In Persia too,\" said Darius, putting on an appearance of the most perfect composure, \"marriages with very near relations are thought to be the best.\"  \"But to return to the king,\" said Croesus, turning the conversation for Darius' sake.  \"I can assure you, Rhodopis, that he may really be called a noble man.  His violent and hasty deeds are repented of almost as soon as committed, and the resolution to be a just and merciful ruler has never forsaken him.  At supper, for instance, lately, before his mind was clouded by the influence of wine, he asked us what the Persians thought of him in comparison with his father.\"  \"And what was the answer?\"  said Rhodopis.  \"Intaphernes got us out of the trap cleverly enough,\" answered Zopyrus, laughing.  \"He exclaimed: 'We are of opinion that you deserve the preference, inasmuch as you have not only preserved intact the inheritance bequeathed you by Cyrus, but have extended his dominion beyond the seas by your conquest of Egypt.' This answer did not seem to please the king, however, and poor Intaphernes was not a little horrified to hear him strike his fist on the table and cry, 'Flatterer, miserable flatterer!'  He then turned to Croesus and asked his opinion.  Our wise friend answered at once: 'My  opinion  is  that  you  have not attained to the greatness of your father; for,' added he in a pacifying tone, 'one thing is wanting to you --a son such as Cyrus bequeathed us in yourself.\"  \"First-rate, first-rate,\" cried Rhodopis clapping her hands and laughing. \"An answer that would have done honor to the ready-witted Odysseus himself.  And how did the king take your honeyed pill?\"  \"He was very much pleased, thanked Croesus, and called him his friend.\"  \"And I,\" said Croesus taking up the conversation, \"used the favorable opportunity to dissuade him from the campaigns he has been planning against the long lived Ethiopians, the Ammonians and the Carthaginians. Of the first of these three nations we know scarcely anything but through fabulous tales; by attacking them we should lose much and gain little. The oasis of Ammon is scarcely accessible to a large army, on account of the desert by which it is surrounded; besides which, it seems to me sacrilegious to make war upon a god in the hope of obtaining possession of his treasures, whether we be his worshippers or not.  As to the Carthaginians, facts have already justified my predictions.  Our fleet is manned principally by Syrians and Phoenicians, and they have, as might be expected, refused to go to war against their brethren.  Cambyses laughed at my reasons, and ended by swearing, when he was already somewhat intoxicated, that he could carry out difficult undertakings and subdue powerful nations, even without the help of Bartja and Phanes.\"  \"What could that allusion to you mean, my son?\"  asked Rhodopis.  \"He won the battle of Pelusiam,\" cried Zopyrus, before his friend could answer.  \"He and no one else!\"  \"Yes,\" added Croesus, \"and you might have been more prudent, and have remembered that it is a dangerous thing to excite the jealousy of a man like Cambyses.  You all of you forget that his heart is sore, and that the slightest vexation pains him.  He has lost the woman he really loved; his dearest friend is gone; and now you want to disparage the last thing in this world that he still cares for,--his military glory.\"  \"Don't blame him,\" said Bartja, grasping the old man's hand.  \"My brother has never been unjust, and is far from envying me what I must call my good fortune, for that my attack arrived just at the right time can hardly be reckoned as a merit on my part.  You know he gave me this splendid sabre, a hundred thorough-bred horses, and a golden hand-mill as rewards of my bravery.\"  Croesus' words had caused Sappho a little anxiety at first; but this vanished on hearing her husband speak so confidently, and by the time Zopyrus had finished his wreath and placed it on Rhodopis' head, all her fears were forgotten.  Gyges had prepared his for the young mother.  It was made of snow-white water-lilies, and, when she placed it among her brown curls, she looked so wonderfully lovely in the simple ornament, that Bartja could not help kissing her on the forehead, though so many witnesses were present.  This little episode gave a merry turn to the conversation; every one did his best to enliven the others, refreshments of all kinds were handed round, and even Darius lost his gravity for a time and joined in the jests that were passing among his friends.  When the sun had set, the slaves set elegantly-carved chairs, footstools, and little tables on the open part of the deck.  Our cheerful party now repaired thither and beheld a sight so marvellously beautiful as to be quite beyond their expectations.  The feast of Neith, called in Egyptian \"the lampburning,\" was celebrated by a universal illumination, which began at the rising of the moon.  The shores of the Nile looked like two long lines of fire.  Every temple, house and but was ornamented with lamps according to the means of its possessors.  The porches of the country-houses and the little towers on the larger buildings were all lighted up by brilliant flames, burning in pans of pitch and sending up clouds of smoke, in which the flags and pennons waved gently backwards and forwards.  The palm-trees and sycamores were silvered by the moonlight and threw strange fantastic reflections on the red waters of the Nile-red from the fiery glow of the houses on their shores.  But strong and glowing as was the light of the illumination, its rays had not power to reach the middle of the giant river, where the boat was making its course, and the pleasure-party felt as if they were sailing in dark night between two brilliant days.  Now and then a brightly-lighted boat would come swiftly across the river and seem, as it neared the shore, to be cutting its way through a glowing stream of molten iron.  Lotus-blossoms, white as snow, lay on the surface of the river, rising and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5459"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 10 (#1)"],["body","with the waves, and looking like eyes in the water.  Not a sound could be heard from either shore.  The echoes were carried away by the north-wind, and the measured stroke of the oars and monotonous song of the rowers were the only sounds that broke the stillness of this strange night--a night robbed of its darkness.  For a long time the friends gazed without speaking at the wonderful sight, which seemed to glide past them.  Zopyrus was the first to break the silence by saying, as he drew a long breath: \"I really envy you, Bartja.  If things were as they should be, every one of us would have his dearest wife at his side on such a night as this.\"  \"And who forbade you to bring one of your wives?\"  answered the happy husband.  \"The other five,\" said the youth with a sigh.  \"If I had allowed Oroetes' little daughter Parysatis, my youngest favorite, to come out alone with me to-night, this wonderful sight would have been my last; tomorrow there would have been one pair of eyes less in the world.\"  Bartja took Sappho's hand and held it fast, saying, \"I fancy one wife will content me as long as I live.\"  The young mother pressed his hand warmly again, and said, turning to Zopyrus: \"I don't quite trust you, my friend.  It seems to me that it is not the anger of your wives you fear, so much as the commission of an offence against the customs of your country.  I have been told that my poor Bartja gets terribly scolded in the women's apartments for not setting eunuchs to watch over me, and for letting me share his pleasures.\"  \"He does spoil you terribly,\" answered Zopyrus, \"and our wives are beginning to quote him as an example of kindness and indulgence, whenever we try to hold the reins a little tight.  Indeed there will soon be a regular women's mutiny at the king's gate, and the Achaemenidae who escaped the swords and arrows of the Egyptians, will fall victims to sharp tongues and floods of salt tears.\"  \"Oh! you most impolite Persian!\"  said Syloson laughing.  \"We must make you more respectful to these images of Aphrodite.\"  \"You Greeks! that's a good idea,\" answered the youth.  \"By Mithras, our wives are quite as well off as yours.  It's only the Egyptian women, that are so wonderfully free.\"  \"Yes, you are quite right,\" said Rhodopis.  \"The inhabitants of this strange land have for thousands of years granted our weaker sex the same rights, that they demand for themselves.  Indeed, in many respects, they have given us the preference.  For instance, by the Egyptian law it is the daughters, not the sons, who are commanded to foster and provide for their aged parents, showing how well the fathers of this now humbled people understood women's nature, and how rightly they acknowledged that she far surpasses man in thoughtful solicitude and self-forgetful love. Do not laugh at these worshippers of animals.  I confess that I cannot understand them, but I feel true admiration for a people in the teaching of whose priests, even Pythagoras, that great master in the art of knowledge, assured me lies a wisdom as mighty as the Pyramids.\"  \"And your great master was right,\" exclaimed Darius.  \"You know that I obtained Neithotep's freedom, and, for some weeks past, have seen him and Onuphis very constantly, indeed they have been teaching me.  And oh, how much I have learnt already from those two old men, of which I had no idea before!  How much that is sad I can forget, when I am listening to them! They are acquainted with the entire history of the heavens and the earth. They know the name of every king, and the circumstances of every important event that has occurred during the last four thousand years, the courses of the stars, the works of their own artists and sayings of their sages, during the same immense period of time.  All this knowledge is recorded in huge books, which have been preserved in a palace at Thebes, called the \"place of healing for the soul.  Their laws are a fountain of pure wisdom, and a comprehensive intellect has been shown in the adaptation of all their state institutions to the needs of the country.  I wish we could boast of the same regularity and order at home. The idea that lies at the root of all their knowledge is the use of numbers, the only means by which it is possible to calculate the course of the stars, to ascertain and determine the limits of all that exists, and, by the application of which in the shortening and lengthening of the strings of musical instruments, tones can be regulated.       [We agree with Iamblichus in supposing, that these Pythagorean views      were derived from the Egyptian mysteries.]  \"Numbers are the only certain things; they can neither be controlled nor perverted.  Every nation has its own ideas of right and wrong; every law can be rendered invalid by circumstances; but the results obtained from numbers can never be overthrown.  Who can dispute, for instance, that twice two make four?  Numbers determine the contents of every existing thing; whatever is, is equal to its contents, numbers therefore are the true being, the essence of all that is.\"  \"In the name of Mithras, Darius, do leave off talking in that style, unless you want to turn my brain,\" interrupted Zopyrus.  \"Why, to hear you, one would fancy you'd been spending your life among these old Egyptian speculators and had never had a sword in your hand.  What on earth have we to do with numbers?\"  \"More  than  you fancy,\" answered  Rhodopis.  \"This theory of numbers belongs to the mysteries of the Egyptian priests, and Pythagoras learnt it from the very Onuphis who is now teaching you, Darius.  If you will come to see me soon, I will show you how wonderfully that great Samian brought the laws of numbers and of the harmonies into agreement.  But look, there are the Pyramids!\"  The whole party rose at these words, and stood speechless, gazing at the grand sight which opened before them.  The Pyramids lay on the left bank of the Nile, in the silver moonshine, massive and awful, as if bruising the earth beneath them with their weight; the giant graves of mighty rulers.  They seemed examples of man's creative power, and at the same time warnings of the vanity and mutability of earthly greatness.  For where was Chufu now,--the king who had cemented that mountain of stone with the sweat of his subjects? Where was the long-lived Chafra who had despised the gods, and, defiant in the consciousness of his own strength, was said to have closed the gates of the temples in order to make himself and his name immortal by building a tomb of superhuman dimensions?       [Herodotus repeats, in good faith, that the builders of the great      Pyramids were despisers of the gods.  The tombs of their faithful      subjects at the foot of these huge structures prove, however, that      they owe their bad repute to the hatred of the people, who could not      forget the era of their hardest bondage, and branded the memories of      their oppressors wherever an opportunity could be found.  We might      use the word \"tradition\" instead of \"the people,\" for this it is      which puts the feeling and tone of mind of the multitude into the      form of history.]  Their empty sarcophagi are perhaps tokens, that the judges of the dead found them unworthy of rest in the grave, unworthy of the resurrection, whereas the builder of the third and most beautiful pyramid, Menkera, who contented himself with a smaller monument, and reopened the gates of the temples, was allowed to rest in peace in his coffin of blue basalt.  There they lay in the quiet night, these mighty pyramids, shone on by the bright stars, guarded by the watchman of the desert--the gigantic sphinx,--and overlooking the barren rocks of the Libyan stony mountains. At their feet, in beautifully-ornamented tombs, slept the mummies of their faithful subjects, and opposite the monument of the pious Menkera stood a temple, where prayers were said by the priests for the souls of the many dead buried in the great Memphian city of the dead.  In the west, where the sun went down behind the Libyan mountains, where the fruitful land ended and the desert began--there the people of Memphis had buried their dead; and as our gay party looked towards the west they felt awed into a solemn silence.  But their boat sped on before the north-wind; they left the city of the dead behind them and passed the enormous dikes built to protect the city of Menes from the violence of the floods; the city of the Pharaohs came in sight, dazzlingly bright with the myriads of flames which had been kindled in honor of the goddess Neith, and when at last the gigantic temple of Ptah appeared, the most ancient building of the most ancient land, the spell broke, their tongues were loosed, and they burst out into loud exclamations of delight.  It was illuminated by thousands of lamps; a hundred fires burnt on its Pylons, its battlemented walls and roofs.  Burning torches flared between the rows of sphinxes which connected the various gates with the main building, and the now empty house of the god Apis was so surrounded by colored fires that it gleamed like a white limestone rock in a tropical sunset.  Pennons, flags and garlands waved above the brilliant picture; music and loud songs could be heard from below.  \"Glorious,\" cried Rhodopis in enthusiasm, \"glorious!  Look how the painted walls and columns gleam in the light, and what marvellous figures the shadows of the obelisks and sphinxes throw on the smooth yellow pavement!\"  \"And how mysterious the sacred grove looks yonder!\"  added Croesus.  \"I never saw anything so wonderful before.\"  \"I have seen something more wonderful still,\" said Darius.  \"You will hardly believe me when I tell you that I have witnessed a celebration of the mysteries of Neith.\"  \"Tell us what you saw, tell us!\"  was the universal outcry.  \"At first Neithotep refused me admission, but when I promised to remain hidden, and besides, to obtain the freedom of his child, he led me up"]]]
