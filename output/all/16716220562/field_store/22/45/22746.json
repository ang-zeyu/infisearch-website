Was she awake or was she a prey to some horrid dream?  She hardly knew, and, indeed, she scarcely understood half of all she heard till the Roman's name was mentioned.  She felt as if the point of a thin, keen knife was being driven obliquely through her brain from right to left, as it now flashed through her mind that it was against him, against Publius, that the wild beasts, disguised in human form, were directed by Eulaeus, and face to face with this--the most hideous, the most incredible of horrors--she suddenly recovered the full use of her senses.  She softly slipped close to that rift in the partition through which the broadest beam of light fell into the room, put her ear close to it, and drank in, with fearful attention, word for word the report made by the eunuch to his iniquitous superior, who frequently interrupted him with remarks, words of approval or a short laugh-drank them in, as a man perishing in the desert drinks the loathsome waters of a salt pool.  And what she heard was indeed well fitted to deprive her of her senses, but the more definite the facts to which the words referred that she could overhear, the more keenly she listened, and the more resolutely she collected her thoughts.  Eulaeus had used her own name to induce the Roman to keep an assignation at midnight in the desert close to the Apis- tombs.  He repeated the words that he had written to this effect on a tile, and which requested Publius to come quite alone to the spot indicated, since she dare not speak with him in the temple.  Finally he was invited to write his answer on the other side of the square of clay. As Klea heard these words, put into her own mouth by a villain, she could have sobbed aloud heartily with anguish, shame, and rage; but the point now was to keep her ears wide open, for Euergetes asked his odious tool:  \"And what was the Roman's answer?\"  Eulaeus must have handed the tile to the king, for he laughed loudly again, and cried out:  \"So he will walk into the trap--will arrive by half an hour after midnight at the latest, and greets Klea from her sister Irene.  He carries on love-making and abduction wholesale, and buys water-bearers by the pair, like doves in the market or sandals in a shoe maker's stall. Only see how the simpleton writes Greek; in these few words there are two mistakes, two regular schoolboys' blunders.  \"The fellow must have had a very pleasant day of it, since he must have been reckoning on a not unsuccessful evening--but the gods have an ugly habit of clenching the hand with which they have long caressed their favorites, and striking him with their fist.  \"Amalthea's horn has been poured out on him today; first he snapped up, under my very nose, my little Hebe, the Irene of Irenes, whom I hope to- morrow to inherit from him; then he got the gift of my best Cyrenaan horses, and at the same time the flattering assurance of my valuable friendship; then he had audience of my fair sister--and it goes more to the heart of a republican than you would believe when crowned heads are graciously disposed towards him--finally the sister of his pretty sweetheart invites him to an assignation, and she, if you and Zoe speak the truth, is a beauty in the grand style.  Now these are really too many good things for one inhabitant of this most stingily provided world; and in one single day too, which, once begun, is so soon ended; and justice requires that we should lend a helping hand to destiny, and cut off the head of this poppy that aspires to rise above its brethren; the thousands who have less good fortune than he would otherwise have great cause to complain of neglect.\"  \"I am happy to see you in such good humor,\" said Eulaeus.  \"My humor is as may be,\" interrupted the king.  \"I believe I am only whistling a merry tune to keep up my spirits in the dark.  If I were on more familiar terms with what other men call fear I should have ample reason to be afraid; for in the quail-fight we have gone in for I have wagered a crown-aye, and more than that even.  To-morrow only will decide whether the game is lost or won, but I know already to-day that I would rather see my enterprise against Philometor fail, with all my hopes of the double crown, than our plot against the life of the Roman; for I was a man before I was a king, and a man I should remain, if my throne, which now indeed stands on only two legs, were to crash under my weight.  \"My sovereign dignity is but a robe, though the costliest, to be sure, of all garments.  If forgiveness were any part of my nature I might easily forgive the man who should soil or injure that--but he who comes too near to Euergetes the man, who dares to touch this body, and the spirit it contains, or to cross it in its desires and purposes--him I will crush unhesitatingly to the earth, I will see him torn in pieces.  Sentence is passed on the Roman, and if your ruffians do their duty, and if the gods accept the holocaust that I had slain before them at sunset for the success of my project, in a couple of hours Publius Cornelius Scipio will have bled to death.  \"He is in a position to laugh at me--as a man--but I therefore--as a man --have the right, and--as a king--have the power, to make sure that that laugh shall be his last.  If I could murder Rome as I can him how glad should I be! for Rome alone hinders me from being the greatest of all the great kings of our time; and yet I shall rejoice to-morrow when they tell me Publius Cornelius Scipio has been torn by wild beasts, and his body is so mutilated that his own mother could not recognize it more than if a messenger were to bring me the news that Carthage had broken the power of Rome.\"  Euergetes had spoken the last words in a voice that sounded like the roll of thunder as it growls in a rapidly approaching storm, louder, deeper, and more furious each instant.  When at last he was silent Eulaeus said: \"The immortals, my lord, will not deny you this happiness.  The brave fellows whom you condescended to see and to talk to strike as certainly as the bolt of our father Zeus, and as we have learned from the Roman's horse-keeper where he has hidden Irene, she will no more elude your grasp than the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt.--Now, allow me to put on your mantle, and then to call the body-guard that they may escort you as you return to your residence.\"  \"One thing more,\" cried the king, detaining Eulaeus.  \"There are always troops by the Tombs of Apis placed there to guard the sacred places; may not they prove a hindrance to your friends?\"  \"I have withdrawn all the soldiers and armed guards to Memphis down to the last man,\" replied Eulaeus, and quartered them within the White Wall. Early tomorrow, before you proceed to business, they will be replaced by a stronger division, so that they may not prove a reinforcement to your brother's troops here if things come to fighting.\"  \"I shall know how to reward your foresight,\" said Euergetes as Eulaeus quitted the room.  Again Klea heard a door open, and the sound of many hoofs on the pavement of the court-yard, and when she went, all trembling, up to the window, she saw Euergetes himself, and the powerfully knit horse that was led in for him.  The tyrant twisted his hand in the mane of the restless and pawing steed, and Klea thought that the monstrous mass could never mount on to the horse's back without the aid of many men; but she was mistaken, for with a mighty spring the giant flung himself high in the air and on to the horse, and then, guiding his panting steed by the pressure of his knees alone, he bounded out of the prison-yard surrounded by his splendid train.  For some minutes the court-yard remained empty, then a man hurriedly crossed it, unlocked the door of the room where Klea was, and informed her that he was a subaltern under Glaucus, and had brought her a message from him.  \"My lord,\" said the veteran soldier to the girl, \"bid me greet you, and says that he found neither the Roman Publius Scipio, nor his friend the Corinthian at home.  He is prevented from coming to you himself; he has his hands full of business, for soldiers in the service of both the kings are quartered within the White Wall, and all sorts of squabbles break out between them.  Still, you cannot remain in this room, for it will shortly be occupied by a party of young officers who began the fray.  Glaucus proposes for your choice that you should either allow me to conduct you to his wife or return to the temple to which you are attached.  In the latter case a chariot shall convey you as far as the second tavern in Khakem on the borders of the desert-for the city is full of drunken soldiery.  There you may probably find an escort if you explain to the host who you are.  But the chariot must be back again in less than an hour, for it is one of the king's, and when the banquet is over there may be a scarcity of chariots.\"  \"Yes--I will go back to the place I came from,\" said Klea eagerly, interrupting the messenger.  \"Take me at once to the chariot.\"  \"Follow me, then,\" said the old man.  \"But I have no veil,\" observed Klea, \"and have only this thin robe on. Rough soldiers snatched my wrapper from my face, and my cloak from off my shoulders.\"  \"I will bring you the captain's cloak which is lying here in the orderly's room, and his travelling-hat too; that will hide your face with its broad flap.  You are so tall that you might be taken for a man, and that is well, for a woman leaving the palace at this hour would hardly pass unmolested.  A slave shall fetch the things from your temple to-morrow.  I may inform you that my master ordered me take as much care of you as if you were his own daughter.  And he told me too--and I had nearly forgotten it--to tell you that your sister was carried off by the Roman, and not by that other dangerous man, you would know whom he meant. Now wait,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5464"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 4 (#4)"],["body","ray, till I return; I shall not be long gone.\"  In a few minutes the guard returned with a large cloak in which he wrapped Klea, and a broad-brimmed travelling-hat which she pressed down on her head, and he then conducted her to that quarter of the palace where the king's stables were.  She kept close to the officer, and was soon mounted on a chariot, and then conducted by the driver--who took her for a young Macedonian noble, who was tempted out at night by some assignation--as far as the second tavern on the road back to the Serapeum.     CHAPTER XIX.  While Klea had been listening to the conversation between Euergetes and Eulaeus, Cleopatra had been sitting in her tent, and allowing herself to be dressed with no less care than on the preceding evening, but in other garments.  It would seem that all had not gone so smoothly as she wished during the day, for her two tire-women had red eyes.  Her lady-in-waiting, Zoe, was reading to her, not this time from a Greek philosopher but from a Greek translation of the Hebrew Psalms: a discussion as to their poetic merit having arisen a few days previously at the supper-table.  Onias, the Israelite general, had asserted that these odes might be compared with those of Alcman or of Pindar, and had quoted certain passages that had pleased the queen.  To-day she was not disposed for thought, but wanted something strange and out of the common to distract her mind, so she desired Zoe to open the book of the Hebrews, of which the translation was considered by the Hellenic Jews in Alexandria as an admirable work--nay, even as inspired by God himself; it had long been known to her through her Israelite friends and guests.  Cleopatra had been listening for about a quarter of an hour to Zoe's reading when the blast of a trumpet rang out on the steps which led up her tent, announcing a visitor of the male sex.  The queen glanced angrily round, signed to her lady to stop reading, and exclaimed:  \"I will not see my husband now!  Go, Thais, and tell the eunuchs on the steps, that I beg Philometor not to disturb me just now.  Go on, Zoe.\"  Ten more psalms had been read, and a few verses repeated twice or thrice by Cleopatra's desire, when the pretty Athenian returned with flaming cheeks, and said in an excited tone:  \"It is not your husband, the king, but your brother Euergetes, who asks to speak with you.\"  \"He might have chosen some other hour,\" replied Cleopatra, looking round at her maid.  Thais cast down her eyes, and twitched the edge of her robe between her fingers as she addressed her mistress; but the queen, whom nothing could escape that she chose to see, and who was not to-day in the humor for laughing or for letting any indiscretion escape unreproved, went on at once in an incensed and cutting tone, raising her voice to a sharp pitch:  \"I do not choose that my messengers should allow themselves to be detained, be it by whom it may--do you hear!  Leave Me this instant and go to your room, and stay there till I want you to undress me this evening.  Andromeda--do you hear, old woman?--you can bring my brother to me, and he will let you return quicker than Thais, I fancy.  You need not leer at yourself in the glass, you cannot do anything to alter your wrinkles.  My head-dress is already done.  Give me that linen wrapper, Olympias, and then he may come!  Why, there he is already!  First you ask permission, brother, and then disdain to wait till it is given you.\"  \"Longing and waiting,\" replied Euergetes, \"are but an ill-assorted couple.  I wasted this evening with common soldiers and fawning flatterers; then, in order to see a few noble countenances, I went into the prison, after that I hastily took a bath, for the residence of your convicts spoils one's complexion more, and in a less pleasant manner, than this little shrine, where everything looks and smells like Aphrodite's tiring-room; and now I have a longing to hear a few good words before supper-time comes.\"  \"From my lips?\"  asked Cleopatra.  \"There are none that can speak better, whether by the Nile or the Ilissus.\"  \"What do you want of me?\"  \"I--of you?\"  \"Certainly, for you do not speak so prettily unless you want something.\"  \"But I have already told you!  I want to hear you say something wise, something witty, something soul-stirring.\"  \"We cannot call up wit as we would a maid-servant.  It comes unbidden, and the more urgently we press it to appear the more certainly it remains away.\"  \"That may be true of others, but not of you who, even while you declare that you have no store of Attic salt, are seasoning your speech with it. All yield obedience to grace and beauty, even wit and the sharp-tongued Momus who mocks even at the gods.\"  \"You are mistaken, for not even my own waiting-maids return in proper time when I commission them with a message to you.\"  \"And may we not to be allowed to sacrifice to the Charites on the way to the temple of Aphrodite?\"  \"If I were indeed the goddess, those worshippers who regarded my hand- maidens as my equals would find small acceptance with me.\"  \"Your reproof is perfectly just, for you are justified in requiring that all who know you should worship but one goddess, as the Jews do but one god.  But I entreat you do not again compare yourself to the brainless Cyprian dame.  You may be allowed to do so, so far as your grace is concerned; but who ever saw an Aphrodite philosophizing and reading serious books?  I have disturbed you in grave studies no doubt; what is the book you are rolling up, fair Zoe?\"  \"The sacred book of the Jews, Sire,\" replied Zoe; \"one that I know you do not love.\"  And you--who read Homer, Pindar, Sophocles, and Plato--do you like it?\" asked Euergetes.  \"I find passages in it which show a profound knowledge of life, and others of which no one can dispute the high poetic flight,\" replied Cleopatra.  \"Much of it has no doubt a thoroughly barbarian twang, and it is particularly in the Psalms--which we have now been reading, and which might be ranked with the finest hymns--that I miss the number and rhythm of the syllables, the observance of a fixed metre--in short, severity of form.  David, the royal poet, was no less possessed by the divinity when he sang to his lyre than other poets have been, but he does not seem to have known that delight felt by our poets in overcoming the difficulties they have raised for themselves.  The poet should slavishly obey the laws he lays down for himself of his own free-will, and subordinate to them every word, and yet his matter and his song should seem to float on a free and soaring wing.  Now, even the original Hebrew text of the Psalms has no metrical laws.\"  \"I could well dispense with them,\" replied Euergetes; \"Plato too disdained to measure syllables, and I know passages in his works which are nevertheless full of the highest poetic beauty.  Besides, it has been pointed out to me that even the Hebrew poems, like the Egyptian, follow certain rules, which however I might certainly call rhetorical rather than poetical.  The first member in a series of ideas stands in antithesis to the next, which either re-states the former one in a new form or sets it in a clearer light by suggesting some contrast.  Thus they avail themselves of the art of the orator--or indeed of the painter --who brings a light color into juxtaposition with a dark one, in order to increase its luminous effect.  This method and style are indeed not amiss, and that was the least of all the things that filled me with aversion for this book, in which besides, there is many a proverb which may be pleasing to kings who desire to have submissive subjects, and to fathers who would bring up their sons in obedience to themselves and to the laws.  Even mothers must be greatly comforted by them,--who ask no more than that their children may get through the world without being jostled or pushed, and unmolested if possible, that they may live longer than the oaks or ravens, and be blessed with the greatest possible number of descendants.  Aye! these ordinances are indeed precious to those who accept them, for they save them the trouble of thinking for themselves. Besides, the great god of the Jews is said to have dictated all that this book contains to its writers, just as I dictate to Philippus, my hump- backed secretary, all that I want said.  They regard everyone as a blasphemer and desecrator who thinks that anything written in that roll is erroneous, or even merely human.  Plato's doctrines are not amiss, and yet Aristotle had criticised them severely and attempted to confute them. I myself incline to the views of the Stagyrite, you to those of the noble Athenian, and how many good and instructive hours we owe to our discussions over this difference of opinion!  And how amusing it is to listen when the Platonists on the one hand and the Aristotelians on the other, among the busy threshers of straw in the Museum at Alexandria, fall together by the ears so vehemently that they would both enjoy flinging their metal cups at each others' heads--if the loss of the wine, which I pay for, were not too serious to bear.  We still seek for truth; the Jews believe they possess it entirely.  \"Even those among them who most zealously study our philosophers believe this; and yet the writers of this book know of nothing but actual present, and their god--who will no more endure another god as his equal than a citizen's wife will admit a second woman to her husband's house-- is said to have created the world out of nothing for no other purpose but to be worshipped and feared by its inhabitants.  \"Now, given a philosophical Jew who knows his Empedocles--and I grant there are many such in Alexandria, extremely keen and cultivated men-- what idea can he form in his own mind of 'creation out of nothing?'  Must he not pause to think very seriously when he remembers the fundamental axiom that 'out of nothing, nothing can come,' and that nothing which has once existed can ever be"]]]
