The world was at least ignorant of its bereavement, while to me it was a real and terrible actuality.  \"What can we do?\" I asked, hiding my perturbation beneath the mask of a low and level voice.  \"We may stop here, and die of asphyxiation when our atmosphere tanks are empty,\" replied Perry, \"or we may continue on with the slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface.  If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive.  There would seem to me to be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than as though we sat supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death.\"  I glanced at the thermometer.  It registered 110 degrees.  While we were talking the mighty iron mole had bored its way over a mile into the rock of the earth's crust.  \"Let us continue on, then,\" I replied.  \"It should soon be over at this rate.  You never intimated that the speed of this thing would be so high, Perry.  Didn't you know it?\"  \"No,\" he answered.  \"I could not figure the speed exactly, for I had no instrument for measuring the mighty power of my generator.  I reasoned, however, that we should make about five hundred yards an hour.\"  \"And we are making seven miles an hour,\" I concluded for him, as I sat with my eyes upon the distance meter.  \"How thick is the Earth's crust, Perry?\" I asked.  \"There are almost as many conjectures as to that as there are geologists,\" was his answer.  \"One estimates it thirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing at the rate of about one degree to each sixty to seventy feet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances at that distance beneath the surface.  Another finds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid, must at least have a shell not less than eight hundred to a thousand miles in thickness.  So there you are.  You may take your choice.\"  \"And if it should prove solid?\" I asked.  \"It will be all the same to us in the end, David,\" replied Perry.  \"At the best our fuel will suffice to carry us but three or four days, while our atmosphere cannot last to exceed three.  Neither, then, is sufficient to bear us in the safety through eight thousand miles of rock to the antipodes.\"  \"If the crust is of sufficient thickness we shall come to a final stop between six and seven hundred miles beneath the earth's surface; but during the last hundred and fifty miles of our journey we shall be corpses.  Am I correct?\" I asked.  \"Quite correct, David.  Are you frightened?\"  \"I do not know.  It all has come so suddenly that I scarce believe that either of us realizes the real terrors of our position.  I feel that I should be reduced to panic; but yet I am not.  I imagine that the shock has been so great as to partially stun our sensibilities.\"  Again I turned to the thermometer.  The mercury was rising with less rapidity.  It was now but 140 degrees, although we had penetrated to a depth of nearly four miles.  I told Perry, and he smiled.  \"We have shattered one theory at least,\" was his only comment, and then he returned to his self-assumed occupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel.  I once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would have seemed like those of a tyro alongside of Perry's masterful and scientific imprecations.  Once more I tried my hand at the wheel, but I might as well have essayed to swing the earth itself.  At my suggestion Perry stopped the generator, and as we came to rest I again threw all my strength into a supreme effort to move the thing even a hair's breadth--but the results were as barren as when we had been traveling at top speed.  I shook my head sadly, and motioned to the starting lever.  Perry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging downward toward eternity at the rate of seven miles an hour.  I sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the distance meter.  The mercury was rising very slowly now, though even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within the narrow confines of our metal prison.  About noon, or twelve hours after our start upon this unfortunate journey, we had bored to a depth of eighty-four miles, at which point the mercury registered 153 degrees F.  Perry was becoming more hopeful, although upon what meager food he sustained his optimism I could not conjecture.  From cursing he had turned to singing--I felt that the strain had at last affected his mind.  For several hours we had not spoken except as he asked me for the readings of the instruments from time to time, and I announced them.  My thoughts were filled with vain regrets.  I recalled numerous acts of my past life which I should have been glad to have had a few more years to live down.  There was the affair in the Latin Commons at Andover when Calhoun and I had put gunpowder in the stove--and nearly killed one of the masters.  And then--but what was the use, I was about to die and atone for all these things and several more.  Already the heat was sufficient to give me a foretaste of the hereafter.  A few more degrees and I felt that I should lose consciousness.  \"What are the readings now, David?\" Perry's voice broke in upon my somber reflections.  \"Ninety miles and 153 degrees,\" I replied.  \"Gad, but we've knocked that thirty-mile-crust theory into a cocked hat!\" he cried gleefully.  \"Precious lot of good it will do us,\" I growled back.  \"But my boy,\" he continued, \"doesn't that temperature reading mean anything to you?  Why it hasn't gone up in six miles.  Think of it, son!\"  \"Yes, I'm thinking of it,\" I answered; \"but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow.\" But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try.  The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead--when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.  At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.  From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.  During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.  Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.  Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.  One hundred and fifty-three degrees had been the maximum temperature above the ice stratum.  Would it stop at this point again, or would it continue its merciless climb?  We knew that there was no hope, and yet with the persistence of life itself we continued to hope against practical certainty.  Already the air tanks were at low ebb--there was barely enough of the precious gases to sustain us for another twelve hours.  But would we be alive to know or care?  It seemed incredible.  At four hundred and twenty miles I took another reading.  \"Perry!\" I shouted.  \"Perry, man!  She's going down! She's going down! She's 152 degrees again.\"  \"Gad!\" he cried.  \"What can it mean?  Can the earth be cold at the center?\"  \"I do not know, Perry,\" I answered; \"but thank God, if I am to die it shall not be by fire--that is all that I have feared.  I can face the thought of any death but that.\"  Down, down went the mercury until it stood as low as it had seven miles from the surface of the earth, and then of a sudden the realization broke upon us that death was very near.  Perry was the first to discover it.  I saw him fussing with the valves that regulate the air supply.  And at the same time I experienced difficulty in breathing. My head felt dizzy--my limbs heavy.  I saw Perry crumple in his seat.  He gave himself a shake and sat erect again.  Then he turned toward me.  \"Good-bye, David,\" he said.  \"I guess this is the end,\" and then he smiled and closed his eyes.  \"Good-bye, Perry, and good luck to you,\" I answered,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/545"],["title","At the Earth's Core (#2)"],["body","back at him.  But I fought off that awful lethargy.  I was very young--I did not want to die.  For an hour I battled against the cruelly enveloping death that surrounded me upon all sides.  At first I found that by climbing high into the framework above me I could find more of the precious life-giving elements, and for a while these sustained me.  It must have been an hour after Perry had succumbed that I at last came to the realization that I could no longer carry on this unequal struggle against the inevitable.  With my last flickering ray of consciousness I turned mechanically toward the distance meter.  It stood at exactly five hundred miles from the earth's surface--and then of a sudden the huge thing that bore us came to a stop.  The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased.  The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me.  The point of the prospector was ABOVE us.  Slowly it dawned on me that since passing through the ice strata it had been above.  We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust.  Thank God! We were safe!  I put my nose to the intake pipe through which samples were to have been taken during the passage of the prospector through the earth, and my fondest hopes were realized--a flood of fresh air was pouring into the iron cabin.  The reaction left me in a state of collapse, and I lost consciousness.     II  A STRANGE WORLD   I was unconscious little more than an instant, for as I lunged forward from the crossbeam to which I had been clinging, and fell with a crash to the floor of the cabin, the shock brought me to myself.  My first concern was with Perry.  I was horrified at the thought that upon the very threshold of salvation he might be dead.  Tearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast.  I could have cried with relief--his heart was beating quite regularly.  At the water tank I wetted my handkerchief, slapping it smartly across his forehead and face several times.  In a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids.  For a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending.  Then his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat up sniffing the air with an expression of wonderment upon his face.  \"Why, David,\" he cried at last, \"it's air, as sure as I live.  Why--why what does it mean?  Where in the world are we?  What has happened?\"  \"It means that we're back at the surface all right, Perry,\" I cried; \"but where, I don't know.  I haven't opened her up yet.  Been too busy reviving you.  Lord, man, but you had a close squeak!\"  \"You say we're back at the surface, David?  How can that be?  How long have I been unconscious?\"  \"Not long.  We turned in the ice stratum.  Don't you recall the sudden whirling of our seats?  After that the drill was above you instead of below.  We didn't notice it at the time; but I recall it now.\"  \"You mean to say that we turned back in the ice stratum, David?  That is not possible.  The prospector cannot turn unless its nose is deflected from the outside--by some external force or resistance--the steering wheel within would have moved in response.  The steering wheel has not budged, David, since we started.  You know that.\"  I did know it; but here we were with our drill racing in pure air, and copious volumes of it pouring into the cabin.  \"We couldn't have turned in the ice stratum, Perry, I know as well as you,\" I replied; \"but the fact remains that we did, for here we are this minute at the surface of the earth again, and I am going out to see just where.\"  \"Better wait till morning, David--it must be midnight now.\"  I glanced at the chronometer.  \"Half after twelve.  We have been out seventy-two hours, so it must be midnight.  Nevertheless I am going to have a look at the blessed sky that I had given up all hope of ever seeing again,\" and so saying I lifted the bars from the inner door, and swung it open.  There was quite a quantity of loose material in the jacket, and this I had to remove with a shovel to get at the opposite door in the outer shell.  In a short time I had removed enough of the earth and rock to the floor of the cabin to expose the door beyond.  Perry was directly behind me as I threw it open.  The upper half was above the surface of the ground.  With an expression of surprise I turned and looked at Perry--it was broad day-light without!  \"Something seems to have gone wrong either with our calculations or the chronometer,\" I said.  Perry shook his head--there was a strange expression in his eyes.  \"Let's have a look beyond that door, David,\" he cried.  Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation of a landscape at once weird and beautiful.  Before us a low and level shore stretched down to a silent sea.  As far as the eye could reach the surface of the water was dotted with countless tiny isles--some of towering, barren, granitic rock--others resplendent in gorgeous trappings of tropical vegetation, myriad starred with the magnificent splendor of vivid blooms.  Behind us rose a dark and forbidding wood of giant arborescent ferns intermingled with the commoner types of a primeval tropical forest. Huge creepers depended in great loops from tree to tree, dense under-brush overgrew a tangled mass of fallen trunks and branches. Upon the outer verge we could see the same splendid coloring of countless blossoms that glorified the islands, but within the dense shadows all seemed dark and gloomy as the grave.  And upon all the noonday sun poured its torrid rays out of a cloudless sky.  \"Where on earth can we be?\" I asked, turning to Perry.  For some moments the old man did not reply.  He stood with bowed head, buried in deep thought.  But at last he spoke.  \"David,\" he said, \"I am not so sure that we are ON earth.\"  \"What do you mean Perry?\" I cried.  \"Do you think that we are dead, and this is heaven?\" He smiled, and turning, pointing to the nose of the prospector protruding from the ground at our backs.  \"But for that, David, I might believe that we were indeed come to the country beyond the Styx.  The prospector renders that theory untenable--it, certainly, could never have gone to heaven.  However I am willing to concede that we actually may be in another world from that which we have always known.  If we are not ON earth, there is every reason to believe that we may be IN it.\"  \"We may have quartered through the earth's crust and come out upon some tropical island of the West Indies,\" I suggested.  Again Perry shook his head.  \"Let us wait and see, David,\" he replied, \"and in the meantime suppose we do a bit of exploring up and down the coast--we may find a native who can enlighten us.\"  As we walked along the beach Perry gazed long and earnestly across the water.  Evidently he was wrestling with a mighty problem.  \"David,\" he said abruptly, \"do you perceive anything unusual about the horizon?\"  As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre and unnatural--THERE WAS NO HORIZON!  As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom--the distance was lost in the distance.  That was all--there was no clear-cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision.  \"A great light is commencing to break on me,\" continued Perry, taking out his watch.  \"I believe that I have partially solved the riddle.  It is now two o'clock. When we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us.  Where is it now?\"  I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven.  And such a sun!  I had scarcely noticed it before.  Fully thrice the size of the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it.  \"My God, Perry, where are we?\" I exclaimed.  \"This thing is beginning to get on my nerves.\"  \"I think that I may state quite positively, David,\" he commenced, \"that we are--\" but he got no further.  From behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there came the most thunderous, awe-inspiring roar that ever had fallen upon my ears.  With one accord we turned to discover the author of that fearsome noise.  Had I still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the sight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it.  Emerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely resembled a bear.  It was fully as large as the largest elephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws.  Its nose, or snout, depended nearly a foot below its lower jaw, much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk.  The giant body was covered by a coat of thick, shaggy hair.  Roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous, shuffling trot.  I turned to Perry to suggest that it might be wise to seek other surroundings--the idea had evidently occurred to Perry previously, for he was already a hundred paces away, and with each second his prodigious bounds increased the distance.  I had never guessed what latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed.  I saw that he was headed toward a little point of the forest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we had been standing, and as the mighty creature, the sight of which had galvanized him into such remarkable action, was forging steadily toward me.  I set off after Perry, though at a somewhat more decorous pace.  It was evident that the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed, so all that I considered necessary was to gain the trees sufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety of some great branch before it came up.  Notwithstanding our danger I could not help but"]]]
