It was no one thing which prisoned her hand and lips, but every fibre of her being, every pulsation of her heart, every glance back into the past to the confines of childhood.  Yet she listened to other thoughts also.  They reminded her of her children, the elation of power, love for the land of her ancestors, and the peril which menaced it without her, the bliss of seeing the light, and the darkness, the silence, the dull rigidity of death, the destruction of the body and the mind cherished and developed with so much care and toil, the horrible torture which might be associated with the transition from life to death--the act of dying.  And what lay before her in the existence which lasted an eternity?  When she no longer breathed beneath the sun, even if the death hour was deferred, and she found that not Epicurus, who believed that with death all things ended, had been right, but the ancient teachings of the Egyptians, what would await her in that world beyond the grave if she purchased a few more years of life by the murder or betrayal of her lover, her husband?  Yet perhaps the punishments inflicted upon the condemned were but bugbears invented by the priesthood, which guarded the regulation of the state in order to curb the unruly conduct of the populace and terrify the turbulent transgressors of the law.  And, whispered the daring Greek spirit, in the abode of the condemned, not in the Garden of Aalu, the Elysian Fields of the Egyptians, she would meet her father and mother and all her wicked ancestors down to Euergetes I., who was succeeded by the infamous Philopater.  Thus the thought of the other world became an antecedent so uncertain as to permit no definite inference, and might therefore be left out of the account.  How would--this must be the form of the question--the years purchased by the murder or betrayal of one whom she loved shape themselves for her?  During the night the image of the murdered man would drive sleep from her couch, and the Furies, the Dirx, as the Roman Antony called them, who pursue murderers with the serpent scourge, were no idle creations of poetic fancy, but fully symbolized the restlessness of the criminal, driven to and fro by the pangs of conscience.  The chief good, the painless happiness of the Epicureans, was forever lost to those burdened by such guilt.  And during the hours of the day and evening?  Ay, then she would be free to heap pleasure on pleasure.  But for whom were the festivals to be celebrated; with whom could she share them?  For many a long year no banquet, no entertainment had given her enjoyment without Mark Antony. For whom did she adorn herself or strive to stay the vanishing charm? And how soon would anguish of soul utterly destroy the spell, which was slowly, slowly, yet steadily diminishing, and, when the mirror revealed wrinkles which the skill of no Olympus could efface, when she----No, she was not created to grow old!  Did the few years of life which must contain so much misery really possess a value great enough to surrender the right of being called by present and future generations the bewitching Cleopatra, the most irresistible of women?  And the children?  Yes, it would have been delightful to see them grow up and occupy the throne, but serious, decisive doubts soon blended even with an idea so rich in joy.  How glorious to greet Caesarion as sovereign of the world in Octavianus's place!  But how could the dreamer, whose first love affair had caused the total sacrifice of dignity and violation of the law, and who now seemed to have once more relapsed into the old state of torpor, attain the position?  The other children inspired fair hopes, and how beautiful it appeared to the mother's heart to see Antonius Helios as King of Egypt; Cleopatra Selene with her first child in her arms; and little Alexander a noble statesman and hero, rich in virtue and talents!  Yet, what would they, Antony's children, whose education she hoped Archibius would direct, feel for the mother who had been their father's murderess?  She shuddered at the thought, remembering the hours when her childish heart had shed tears of blood over the infamous mother whom her father had execrated.  And Queen Tryphoena, whom history recorded as a monster, had not killed her husband, but merely thrust him from the throne.  Arsinoe's execrations of her mother and sister came back to her memory, and the thought that the rosy lips of the twins and her darling Alexander could ever open to curse her,--the idea that the children would ever raise their beloved hands to point at her, the wicked murderess of their father, with horror and scorn--No, no, and again no!  She would not purchase a few more years of valueless life at the cost of this humiliation and shame.  Purchase of whom?  Of that Octavianus who had robbed her son of the heritage of his father, Caesar, and whose mention in the will was like an imputation on her fidelity--the cold-hearted, calculating upstart, whose nature from their first meeting in Rome had repelled, rebuffed, chilled her; of the man by whose cajolery and power her husband--for in her own eyes and those of the Egyptians Antony held this position--had been induced to wed his sister, Octavia, and thereby stamp her, Cleopatra, as merely his love, cast a doubt upon the legitimate birth of her children; of the false friend of the trusting Antony who, before the battle of Actium, had most deeply humiliated and insulted both!  On the contrary, her royal pride rebelled against obeying the command of such a man to commit the most atrocious deed; and from childhood this pride had been as much a part of her nature as her breath and the pulsation of her heart.  And yet, for her children's sake, she might perhaps have incurred this disgrace, had it not been at the same time the grave of the best and noblest things which she desired to implant in the young souls of the twins and Alexander.  While thinking of the children's curses she had risen from her seat. Why should she reflect and consider longer?  She had found the clear perception she sought.  Let Gorgias hasten the building of the tomb. Should Fate demand her life, she would not resist if she were permitted to preserve it only at the cost of murder or base treachery.  Her lover's was already forfeited.  At his side she had enjoyed a radiant, glowing, peerless bliss, of which the world still talked with envious amazement. At his side, when all was over, she would rest in the grave, and compel the world to remember with respectful sympathy the royal lovers, Antony and Cleopatra.  Her children should be able to think of her with untroubled hearts, and not even the shadow of a bitter feeling, a warning thought, should deter them from adorning their parents' grave with flowers, weeping at its foot, invoking and offering sacrifices to their spirits.  Then she glanced at the statue of Berenike, who had also once worn on her brow the double crown of Egypt.  She, too, had early died a violent death; she, too, had known how to love.  The vow to sacrifice her beautiful hair to Aphrodite if her husband returned uninjured from the Syrian war had rendered her name illustrious.  \"Berenike's Hair\" was still to be seen as a constellation in the night heavens.  Though this woman had sinned often and heavily, one act of loyal love had made her an honoured, worshipped princess.  She--Cleopatra would do something still greater.  The sacrifice which she intended to impose upon herself would weigh far more heavily in the balance than a handful of beautiful tresses, and would comprise sovereignty and life.  With head erect and a sense of proud self-reliance she gazed at the noble marble countenance of the Cyrenian queen.  Ere entering the sanctuary she had imagined that she knew how the criminals whom she had sentenced to death must feel.  Now that she herself had done with life, she felt as if she were relieved from a heavy burden, and yet her heart ached, and-- especially when she thought of her children--she was overwhelmed with the emotion which is the most painful of all forms of compassion--pity for herself.     CHAPTER XVIII.  When Cleopatra left the temple, Iras marvelled at the change in her appearance.  The severe tension which had given her beautiful face a shade of harshness had yielded to an expression of gentle sadness that enhanced its charm, yet her features quickly brightened as her attendant pointed to the procession which was just entering the forecourt of the palace.  In Alexandria and throughout Egypt birthdays were celebrated as far as possible.  Therefore, to do honour to the twins, the children of the city had been sent to offer their congratulations, and at the same time to assure their royal mother of the love and devotion of the citizens.  The return to the palace occupied only a few minutes, and as Cleopatra, hastily donning festal garments, gazed down at the bands of children, it seemed as if Fate by this fair spectacle had given her a sign of approval of her design.  She was soon standing hand in hand with the twins upon the balcony before which the procession had halted.  Hundreds of boys and girls of the same age as the prince and princess had flocked thither, the former bearing bouquets, the latter small baskets filled with lilies and roses.  Every head was crowned with a wreath, and many of the girls wore garlands of flowers.  A chorus of youths and maidens sang a festal hymn, beseeching the gods to grant the royal mother and children every happiness; the leader of the chorus of girls made a short address in the name of the city, and during this speech the children formed in ranks, the tallest in the rear, the smallest in the front, and the others between according to their height.  The scene resembled a living garden, in which rosy faces were the beautiful flowers.  Cleopatra thanked the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5479"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 07 (#8)"],["body","for the charming greeting sent to her by those whom they held dearest, and assured them that she returned their love.  Her eyes grew dim with tears as she went with her three children to the throng who offered their congratulations, and an unusually pretty little girl whom she kissed threw her arms around her as tenderly as if she were her own mother.  And how beautiful was the scene when the girls strewed the contents of their little baskets on the ground before her, and the boys, with many a ringing shout and loving wish, offered the bouquets to her and the twins!  Charmian had not forgotten to provide the gifts; and when the chamberlains and waiting-women led the children into a large hall to offer them refreshments, the Queen's eyes sparkled so brightly that the companion of her childhood ventured to make her difficult confession.  And, as so often happens, the event we most dread shows, when it actually occurs, a friendly or indifferent aspect; this was the case now.  Nothing in life is either great or small--the one may be transformed to the other, according to the things with which it is compared.  The tallest man becomes a dwarf beside a rocky giant of the mountain chain, the smallest is a Titan to the swarming ants in the forest.  The beggar seizes as a treasure what the rich man scornfully casts aside.  That which the day before yesterday seemed to Cleopatra unendurable, roused her keenest anxiety, robbed her of part of her night's repose, and induced her to adopt strenuous measures, now appeared trivial and scarcely worthy of consideration.  Yesterday and to-day had brought events and called up questions which forced Barine's disappearance into the realm of unimportant matters.  Charmian's confession was preceded by the statement that she longed for rest yet, nevertheless, was ready to remain with her royal friend, in every situation, until she no longer desired her services and sent her away.  But she feared that this moment had come.  Cleopatra interrupted her with the assurance that she was speaking of something utterly impossible; and when Charmian disclosed Barine's escape, and admitted that it was she who had aided the flight of the innocent and sorely threatened granddaughter of Didymus, the Queen started up angrily and frowned, but it was only for a moment.  Then, with a smile, she shook her finger at her friend, embraced her, and gravely but kindly assured her that, of all vices, ingratitude was most alien to her nature.  The companion of her childhood had bestowed so many proofs of faithfulness, love, self-sacrifice, and laborious service in her behalf that they could not be long outweighed by a single act of wilful disobedience.  An abundant supply would still remain, by virtue of which she might continue to sin without fearing that Cleopatra would ever part from her Charmian.  The latter again perceived that nothing on earth could be hostile or sharp enough to sever the bond which united her to this woman.  When her lips overflowed with the gratitude which filled her heart, Cleopatra admitted that it seemed as if, in aiding Barine's escape, she had rendered her a service.  The caution with which Charmian had concealed Barine's refuge had not escaped her notice, and she did not ask to learn it.  It was enough for her that the dangerous beauty was out of Caesarion's reach.  As for Antony, a wall now separated him from the world, and consequently from the woman who, spite of Alexas's accusations, had probably never stood closer to his heart.  Charmian now eagerly strove to show the Queen what had induced the Syrian to pursue Barine so vindictively.  It was evident--and scarcely needed proof--that Mark Antony's whole acquaintanceship with the old scholar's granddaughter had been far from leading to any tender relation.  But Cleopatra gave only partial attention.  The man whom she had loved with every pulsation of her heart already seemed to her only a dear memory. She did not forget the happiness enjoyed with and through him, or the wrong she had done by the use of the magic goblet; yet with the wall on the Choma, which divided him from her and the rest of the world, and her command to have the mausoleum built, she imagined that the season of love was over.  Any new additions to this chapter of the life of her heart were but the close.  Even the jealousy which had clouded the happiness of her love like a fleeting, rapidly changing shadow, she believed she had now renounced forever.  While Charmian protested that no one save Dion had ever been heard with favour by Barine, and related many incidents of her former life, Cleopatra's thoughts were with Antony.  Like the image of the beloved dead, the towering figure of the Roman hero rose before her mind, but she recalled him only as he was prior to the battle of Actium.  She desired and expected nothing more from the broken-spirited man, whose condition was perhaps her own fault.  But she had resolved to atone for her guilt, and would do so at the cost of throne and life.  This settled the account.  Whatever her remaining span of existence might add or subtract, was part of the bargain.  The entrance of Alexas interrupted her.  With fiery passion he expressed his regret that he had been defrauded by base intrigues of the right bestowed upon him to pass sentence upon a guilty woman.  This was the more difficult to bear because he was deprived of the possibility of providing for the pursuit of the fugitive.  Antony had honoured him with the commission to win Herod back to his cause.  He was to leave Alexandria that very night.  As nothing could be expected in this matter from the misanthropic Imperator, he hoped that the Queen would avenge such an offence to her dignity, and adopt severe measures towards the singer and her last lover, Dion, who with sacrilegious hands had wounded the son of Caesar.  But Cleopatra, with royal dignity, kept him within the limits of his position, commanded him not to mention the affair to her again, and then, with a sorrowful smile, wished him success with Herod, in whose return to the lost cause of Antony, however, much as she prized the skill of the mediator, she did not believe.  When he had retired, she exclaimed to Charmian: \"Was I blind?  This man is a traitor!  We shall discover it.  Wherever Dion has taken his young wife, let her be carefully concealed, not from me, but from this Syrian. It is easier to defend one's self against the lion than the scorpion. You, my friend, will see that Archibius seeks me this very day.  I must talk with him, and--you no longer have any thought of a parting?  Another will come soon enough, which will forever forbid these lips from kissing your dear face.\"  As she spoke, she again clasped the companion of her childhood in her arms, and when Iras entered to request an audience for Lucilius, Antony's most faithful friend, Cleopatra, who had noticed the younger woman's envious glance at the embrace, said: \"Was I mistaken in fancying that you imagined yourself slighted for Charmian, who is an older friend?  That would be wrong; for I love and need you both.  You are her niece, and indebted to her for much kindness from your earliest childhood.  So, even though you will lose the joy of revenge upon a hated enemy, forget what has happened, as I did, and maintain your former affectionate companionship.  I will reward you for it with the only thing that the daughter of the wealthy Krates cannot purchase, yet which she probably rates at no low value--the love of her royal friend.\"  With these words she clasped Iras also in a close embrace, and when the latter left the room to summon Lucilius, she thought: \"No woman has ever won so much love; perhaps that is why she possesses so great a treasure of it, and can afford such unspeakable happiness by its bestowal.  Or is she so much beloved because she entered the world full of its wealth, and dispenses it as the sun diffuses light?  Surely that must be the case. I have reason to believe it, for whom did I ever love save the Queen? No one, not even myself, and I know no one in whose love for me I can believe.  But why did Dion, whom I loved so fervently, disdain me?  Fool! Why did Mark Antony prefer Cleopatra to Octavia, who was not less fair, whose heart was his, and whose hand held the sovereignty of half the world?\"  Passing on as she spoke, she soon returned, ushering the Roman Lucilius into the presence of the Queen.  A gallant deed had bound this man to Antony.  After the battle of Philippi, when the army of the republicans fled, Brutus had been on the point of being seized by the enemy's horsemen; but Lucilius, at the risk of being cut down, had personated him, and thereby, though but for a short time, rescued him.  This had seemed to Antony unusual and noble and, in his generous manner, he had not only forgiven him, but bestowed his favour upon him.  Lucilius was grateful, and gave him the same fidelity he had showed to Brutus.  At Actium he had risked Antony's favour to prevent his deserting Cleopatra after the battle, and then accompanied him in his flight.  Now he was bearing him company in his seclusion on the Choma.  The grey-haired man who, but a short time before, had retained all the vigour of youth, approached the Queen with bowed head and saddened heart. His face, so regular in its contours, had undergone a marked change within the past few weeks.  The cheeks were sunken, the features had grown sharper, and there was a sorrowful expression in the eyes, which, when informing Cleopatra of his friend's condition, glittered with tears.  Before the hapless battle he was one of Cleopatra's most enthusiastic admirers; but since he had been forced to see his friend and benefactor risk fame, happiness, and honour to follow the Queen, he had cherished a feeling of bitter resentment towards her.  He would certainly have spared himself this mission, had he not been sure that she who had brought her lover to ruin was the only "]]]
