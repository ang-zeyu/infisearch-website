D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 3.    CHAPTER VI.  The men sent by Archibius to obtain news had brought back no definite information; but a short time before, a royal runner had handed him a tablet from Iras, requesting him to visit her the next day.  Disquieting, but fortunately as yet unverified tidings had arrived.  The Regent was doing everything in his power to ascertain the truth; but he (Archibius) was aware of the distrust of the government, and everything connected with it, felt by the sailors and all the seafaring folk at the harbour. An independent person like himself could often learn more than the chief of the harbour police, with all his ships and men.  The little tablet was accompanied by a second, which, in the Regent's name, authorized the bearer to have the harbour chains raised anywhere, to go out into the open sea and return without interference.  The messenger, the overseer of Archibius's galley slaves, was an experienced man.  He undertook to have the \"Epicurus\"--a swift vessel, which Cleopatra had given to her friend--ready for a voyage to the open sea within two hours.  The carriage should be sent for his master, that no time might be lost.  When Archibius had returned to the ladies and asked whether it would be an abuse of their hospitality, if--it was now nearly midnight--he should still delay his departure for a time, they expressed sincere pleasure, and begged him to continue his narrative.  \"I must hasten,\" he hurriedly began, after eating the lunch which Berenike had ordered while he was talking with the messenger, \"but the events of the next few years are hardly worth mentioning.  Besides, my time was wholly occupied by my studies in the museum.  \"As for Cleopatra and Arsinoe, they stood like queens at the head of all the magnificence of the court.  The day on which they left our house was the last of their childhood.  \"Who would venture to determine whether her father's restoration, or the meeting with Antony, had wrought the great change which took place at that time in Cleopatra?  \"Just before  she  left  us, my  mother  had lamented that she must give her to a father like the flute-player, instead of to a worthy mother; for the best could not help regarding herself happy in the possession of such a daughter.  Afterwards her character and conduct were better suited to delight men than to please a mother.  The yearning for peace of mind seemed over.  Only the noisy festivals, the singing and music, of which there was never any cessation in the palace of the royal virtuoso, seemed to weary her and at such times she appeared at our house and spent several days beneath its roof.  Arsinoe never accompanied her; her heart was sometimes won by a golden-haired officer in the ranks of the German horsemen whom Gabinius had left among the garrison of Alexandria, sometimes by a Macedonian noble among the youths who, at that time, performed the service of guarding the palace.  \"Cleopatra lived apart from her, and Arsinoe openly showed her hostility from the time that she entreated her to put an end to the scandal caused by her love affairs.  \"Cleopatra held aloof from such things.  \"Though she had devoted much time to the magic arts of the Egyptians, her clear intellect had rendered her so familiar with the philosophy of the Hellenes that it was a pleasure to hear her converse or argue in the museum-as she often did-with the leaders of the various schools.  Her self-confidence had become very strong.  Though, while with us, she said that she longed to return to the days of the peaceful Garden of Epicurus, she devoted herself eagerly enough to the events occurring in the world and to statecraft.  She was familiar with everything in Rome, the desires and struggles of the contending parties, as well as the characters of the men who were directing affairs, their qualities, views, and aims.  \"She followed Antony's career with the interest of love, for she had bestowed on him the first affection of her young heart.  She had expected the greatest achievements, but his subsequent course seemed to belie these lofty hopes.  A tinge of scorn coloured her remarks concerning him at that time, but here also her heart had its share.  \"Pompey, to whom her father owed his restoration to the throne, she considered a lucky man, rather than a great and wise one.  Of Julius Caesar, on the contrary, long before she met him, she spoke with ardent enthusiasm, though she knew that he would gladly have made Egypt a Roman province.  The greatest deed which she expected from the energetic Julius was that he would abolish the republic, which she hated, and soar upward to tyrannize over the arrogant rulers of the world--only she would fain have seen Antony in his place.  How often in those days she used magic art to assure herself of his future!  Her father was interested in these things, especially as, through them, and the power of the mighty Isis, he expected to obtain relief from his many and severe sufferings.  \"Cleopatra's brothers were still mere boys, completely dependent upon their guardian, Pothinus, to whom the King left the care of the government, and their tutor, Theodotus, a clever but unprincipled rhetorician.  These two men and Achillas, the commander of the troops, would gladly have aided Dionysus, the King's oldest male heir, to obtain the control of the state, in order afterwards to rule him, but the flute- player baffled their plans.  You know that in his last will he made Cleopatra, his favourite child, his successor, but her brother Dionysus was to share the throne as her husband.  This caused much scandal in Rome, though it was an old custom of the house of Ptolemy, and suited the Egyptians.  \"The  flute-player  died.  Cleopatra  became Queen, and at the same time the wife of a husband ten years old, for whom she did not even possess the natural gift of sisterly tenderness.  But with the obstinate child who had been told by his counsellors that the right to rule should be his alone, she also married the former governors of the country.  \"Then began a period of sore suffering.  Her life was a perpetual battle against notorious intrigues, the worst of which owed their origin to her sister.  Arsinoe had surrounded herself with a court of her own, managed by the eunuch Ganymedes, an experienced commander, and at the same time a shrewd adviser, wholly devoted to her interest.  He understood how to bring her into close relations with Pothinus and other rulers of the state, and thus at last united all who possessed any power in the royal palace in an endeavour to thrust Cleopatra from the throne.  Pothinus, Theodotus, and Achillas hated her because she saw their failings and made them feel the superiority of her intellect.  Their combined efforts might have succeeded in overthrowing her before, had not the Alexandrians, headed by the Ephebi, over whom I still had some influence, stood by her so steadfastly.  Whoever could still be classed as a youth glowed with enthusiasm for her, and most of the Macedonian nobles in the body-guard would have gone to death for her sake, though she had forced them to gaze hopelessly up to her as if she were some unapproachable goddess.  \"When her father died she was seventeen, but she knew how to resist oppressors and foes as if she were a man.  My sister, Charmian, whom she had appointed to a place in her service, loyally aided her.  At that time she was a beautiful and lovable girl, but the spell exerted by the Queen fettered her like chains and bonds.  She voluntarily resigned the love of a noble man--he afterwards became your husband, Berenike--in order not to leave her royal friend at a time when she so urgently needed her.  Since then my sister has shut her heart against love.  It belonged to Cleopatra.  She lives, thinks, cares for her alone.  She is fond of you, Barine, because your father was so dear to her.  Iras, whose name is so often associated with hers, is the daughter of my oldest sister, who was already married when the King entrusted the princesses to our father's care.  She is thirteen years younger than Cleopatra, but her mistress holds the first place in her heart also.  Her father, the wealthy Krates, made every effort to keep her from entering the service of the Queen, but in vain.  A single conversation with this marvellous woman had bound her forever.  \"But I must be brief.  You have doubtless heard how completely Cleopatra bewitched Pompey's son during his visit to Alexandria.  She had not been so gracious to any man since her meeting with Antony, and it was not from affection, but to maintain the independence of her beloved native land. At that time the father of Gnejus was the man who possessed the most power, and statecraft commanded her to win him through his son.  The young Roman also took his leave 'full of her,' as the Egyptians say. This pleased her, but the visit greatly aided her foes.  There was no slander which was not disseminated against her.  The commanders of the body-guard, whom she had always treated as a haughty Queen, had seen her associate with Pompey's son in the theatre as if he were a friend of equal rank; and on many other occasions the Alexandrians saw her repay his courtesies in the same coin.  But in those days hatred of Rome surged high.  The regents, leagued with Arsinoe, spread the rumour that Cleopatra would deliver Egypt up to Pompey, if the senate would secure to her the sole sovereignty of the new province, and leave her free to rid herself of her royal brother and husband.  \"She was compelled to fly, and went first to the Syrian frontier, to gain friends for her cause among the Asiatic princes.  My brother Straton--you remember the noble youth who won the prize for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5475"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 03 (#1)"],["body","at Olympia, Berenike--and I were commissioned to carry the treasure to her.  We doubtless exposed ourselves to great peril, but we did so gladly, and left Alexandria with a few camels, an ox-cart, and some trusted slaves. We were to go to Gaza, where Cleopatra was already beginning to collect an army, and had disguised ourselves as Nabataean merchants.  The languages which I had learned, in order not to be distanced by Cleopatra, were now of great service.  \"Those were stirring times.  The names of Caesar and Pompey were in every mouth.  After the defeat at Dyrrachium the cause of Julius seemed lost, but the Pharsalian battle again placed him uppermost, unless the East rose in behalf of Pompey.  Both seemed to be favourites of Fortune.  The question now was to which the goddess would prove most faithful.  \"My sister Charmian was with the Queen, but through one of Arsinoe's maids, who was devoted to her, we had learned from the palace that Pompey's fate was decided.  He had come a fugitive from the defeat of Pharsalus, and begged the King of Egypt--that is, the men who were acting in his name--for a hospitable reception.  Pothinus and his associates had rarely confronted a greater embarrassment.  The troops and ships of the victorious Caesar were close at hand; many of Gabinius' men were serving in the Egyptian army.  To receive the vanquished Pompey kindly was to make the victorious Caesar a foe.  I was to witness the terrible solution of this dilemma.  The infamous words of Theodotus, 'Dead dogs no longer bite,' had turned the scale.  \"My brother and I reached Mount Casius with our precious freight, and pitched our tents to await a messenger, when a large body of armed men approached from the city.  At first we feared that we were pursued; but a spy reported that the King himself was among the soldiery, and at the same time a large Roman galley drew near the coast.  It must be Pompey's. So they had changed their views, and the King was coming in person to receive their guest.  The troops encamped on the flat shore on which stood the Temple of the Casian Amon.  \"The September sun shone brightly, and was reflected from the weapons. From the high bank of the dry bed of the river, where we had pitched our tent, we saw something scarlet move to and fro.  It was the King's mantle.  The waves, stirred by the autumn breeze, rippled lightly, blue as cornflowers, over the yellow sand of the dunes; but the King stood still, shading his eyes with his hand as he gazed at the galley. Meanwhile, Achillas, the commander of the troops, and Septimius, the tribune, who belonged to the Roman garrison in Alexandria, and who, I knew, had served under Pompey and owed him many favours, had entered a boat and put off to the vessel, which could not come nearer the land on account of the shallow water.  \"The conference now began, and Achillas's offer of hospitality must have been very warm and well calculated to inspire confidence, for a tall lady--it was Cornelia, the wife of the Imperator--waved her hand to him in token of gratitude.\"  Here the speaker paused, drew a long breath, and, pressing his hand to his brow, continued \"What follows--alas, that it was my fate to witness the dreadful scene!  How often a garbled account has been given, and yet the whole was so terribly simple!  \"Fortune  makes  her  favourites  confiding.  Pompey was also.  Though more than fifty years old--he lacked two years of sixty--he sprang into the boat quickly enough, with merely a little assistance from a freedman. A sailor--he was a negro--shoved the skiff off from the side of the huge ship as violently as if the pole he used for the purpose was a spear, and the galley his foe.  The boat, urged by his companions' oars, had already moved forward, and he stumbled, the brown cap falling from his woolly head in the act.  \"It seems as if I could still see him.  Ere I clearly realized that this was an evil omen, the boat stopped.  \"The water was shallow.  I saw Achillas point to the shore.  It could be reached by a single bound.  Pompey looked towards the King.  The freedman put his hand under his arm to help him rise.  Septimius also stood up.  I thought he intended to assist him.  But no!  What did this mean? Something flashed  by the  Imperator's silver-grey hair as if a spark had fallen from the sky.  Would Pompey defend himself, or why did he raise his hand?  It was to draw around him the toga, with which he silently covered his face.  The tribune's arm was again raised high into the air, and then--what confusion!  Here, there, yonder, hands suddenly appeared aloft, bright flashes darted through the clear air.  Achillas, the general, dealt blows with his dagger as if he were skilled in murder. The Imperator's stalwart figure sank forward.  The freedman supported him.  \"Then shouts arose, here a cry of fury, yonder a wail of grief, and, rising above all, a woman's shriek of anguish.  It came from the lips of Cornelia, the murdered man's wife.  Shouts of applause from the King's camp followed, then the blast of a trumpet; the Egyptians drew back from the shore.  The scarlet cloak again appeared.  Septimius, bearing in his hand a bleeding head, went towards it and held the ghastly trophy aloft.  \"The royal boy gazed into the dull eyes of the victim, who had guided the destinies of many a battlefield, of Rome, of two quarters of the globe. The sight was probably too terrible for the child upon the throne, for he averted his head.  The ship moved away from the land, the Egyptians formed into ranks and marched off.  Achillas cleansed his blood-stained hands in the sea-water.  The freedman beside him washed his master's headless trunk.  The general shrugged his shoulders as the faithful fellow heaped reproaches on him.\"  Here Archibius paused, drawing a long breath.  Then he continued more calmly:  \"Achillas did not lead the troops back to Alexandria, but eastward, towards Pelusium, as I learned later.  \"My brother and I stood on the rocky edge of the ravine.  It was long ere either spoke.  A cloud of dust concealed the King and his body-guard, the sails of the galley disappeared.  Twilight closed in, and Straton pointed westward towards Alexandria.  Then the sun set.  Red! red!  It seemed as if a torrent of blood was pouring over the city.  \"Night followed.  A scanty fire was glimmering on the strand.  Where had the wood been gathered in this desert?  How had it been kindled?  A wrecked, mouldering boat had lain close beside the scene of the murder. The freedman and his companions had broken it up and fed the flames with withered boughs, the torn garments of the murdered man, and dry sea-weed. A blaze soon rose, and a body was carefully placed upon the wretched funeral pyre.  It was the corpse of the great Pompey.  One of the Imperator's veterans aided the faithful servant.\"  Here Archibius sank back again among the cushions, adding in explanation:  \"Cordus, the man's name was Servius Cordus.  He fared well later.  The Queen provided for him.  The others?  Fate overtook them all soon enough. Theodotus was condemned by Brutus to a torturing death.  Amid his loud shrieks of agony one of Pompey's veterans shouted, 'Dead dogs no longer bite, but they howl when dying!'  \"It was worthy of Caesar that he averted his face in horror from the head of his enemy, which Theodotus sent to him.  Pothinus, too, vainly awaited the reward of his infamous deed.  \"Julius Caesar had cast anchor before Alexandria shortly after the King's return.  Not until after his arrival in Egypt did he learn how Pompey had been received there.  You know that he remained nine months.  How often I have heard it said that Cleopatra understood how to chain him here!  This is both true and false.  He was obliged to stay half a year; the following three months he did indeed give to the woman whom he loved. Ay, the heart of the man of fifty-four had again opened to a great passion.  Like all wounds, those inflicted by the arrows of Eros heal more slowly when youth lies behind the stricken one.  It was not only the eyes and the senses which attracted a couple so widely separated by years, but far more the mental characteristics of both.  Two winged intellects had met.  The genius of one had recognized that of the other. The highest type of manhood had met perfect womanhood.  They could not fail to attract each other.  I expected it; for Cleopatra had long watched breathlessly the flight of this eagle who soared so far above the others, and she was strong enough to keep at his side.  \"We succeeded in joining Cleopatra, and heard that, spite of the hostility of our citizens, Caesar had occupied the palace of the Ptolemies and was engaged in restoring order.  \"We knew in what way Pothinus, Achillas, and Arsinoe would seek to influence him.  Cleopatra had good reason to fear that her foes might deliver Egypt unconditionally to Rome, if Caesar should leave the reins of government in their hands and shut her out.  She had cause to dread this, but she also had the courage to act in person in her own behalf.  \"The point now was to bring her into the city, the palace-nay, into direct communication with the dictator.  Children tell the tale of the strong man who bore Cleopatra in a sack through the palace portals.  It was not a sack which concealed her, but a Syrian carpet.  The strong man was my brother Straton.  I went first, to secure a free passage.  \"Julius Caesar and she saw and found each other.  Fate merely drew the conclusion which must result from such premises.  Never have I seen Cleopatra happier, more exalted in mind and heart, yet she was menaced on all sides by serious perils.  It required all the military genius of Caesar to conquer the fierce hostility which he encountered here.  It was this, not the thrall of Cleopatra, I repeat, which first bound him to Egypt.  What would have prevented him--as he did later--from taking the object of his love to Rome, had it been possible at that"]]]
