Nebsecht was dearer and nearer to Pentaur than any other of his associates.  He admired his learning and skill; and when the slightly-built surgeon, who was indefatigable in his wanderings, roved through the thickets by the Nile, the desert, or the mountain range, the young poet-priest accompanied him with pleasure and with great benefit to himself, for his companion observed a thousand things to which without him he would have remained for ever blind; and the objects around him, which were known to him only by their shapes, derived connection and significance from the explanations of the naturalist, whose intractable tongue moved freely when it was required to expound to his friend the peculiarities of organic beings whose development he had been the first to detect.  The poet was dear in the sight of Nebsecht, and he loved Pentaur, who possessed all the gifts he lacked; manly beauty, childlike lightness of heart, the frankest openness, artistic power, and the gift of expressing in word and song every emotion that stirred his soul. The poet was as a novice in the order in which Nebsecht was master, but quite capable of understanding its most difficult points; so it happened that Nebsecht attached greater value to his judgment than to that of his own colleagues, who showed themselves fettered by prejudice, while Pentaur’s decision always was free and unbiassed.  The naturalist’s room lay on the ground floor, and had no living-rooms above it, being under one of the granaries attached to the temple. It was as large as a public hall, and yet Pentaur, making his way towards the silent owner of the room, found it everywhere strewed with thick bundles of every variety of plant, with cages of palm-twigs piled four or five high, and a number of jars, large and small, covered with perforated paper. Within these prisons moved all sorts of living creatures, from the jerboa, the lizard of the Nile, and a light-colored species of owl, to numerous specimens of frogs, snakes, scorpions and beetles.  On the solitary table in the middle of the room, near to a writing-stand, lay bones of animals, with various sharp flints and bronze knives.  In a corner of this room lay a mat, on which stood a wooden head-prop, indicating that the naturalist was in the habit of sleeping on it.  When Pentaur’s step was heard on the threshold of this strange abode, its owner pushed a rather large object under the table, threw a cover over it, and hid a sharp flint scalpel     [The Egyptians seem to have preferred to use flint instruments for    surgical purposes, at any rate for the opening of bodies and for    circumcision. Many flint instruments have been found and preserved    in museums.]  fixed into a wooden handle, which he had just been using, in the folds of his robe-as a school-boy might hide some forbidden game from his master. Then he crossed his arms, to give himself the aspect of a man who is dreaming in harmless idleness.  The solitary lamp, which was fixed on a high stand near his chair, shed a scanty light, which, however, sufficed to show him his trusted friend Pentaur, who had disturbed Nebsecht in his prohibited occupations. Nebsecht nodded to him as he entered, and, when he had seen who it was, said:  “You need not have frightened me so!” Then he drew out from under the table the object he had hidden--a living rabbit fastened down to a board-and continued his interrupted observations on the body, which he had opened and fastened back with wooden pins while the heart continued to beat.  He took no further notice of Pentaur, who for some time silently watched the investigator; then he laid his hand on his shoulder and said:  “Lock your door more carefully, when you are busy with forbidden things.”  “They took--they took away the bar of the door lately,” stammered the naturalist, “when they caught me dissecting the hand of the forger Ptahmes.”--[The law sentenced forgers to lose a hand.]  “The mummy of the poor man will find its right hand wanting,” answered the poet.  “He will not want it out there.”  “Did you bury the least bit of an image in his grave?”     [Small statuettes, placed in graves to help the dead in the work    performed in the under-world. They have axes and ploughs in their    hands, and seed-bags on their backs. The sixth chapter of the Book    of the Dead is inscribed on nearly all.]  “Nonsense.”  “You go very far, Nebsecht, and are not foreseeing, ‘He who needlessly hurts an innocent animal shall be served in the same way by the spirits of the netherworld,’ says the law; but I see what you will say. You hold it lawful to put a beast to pain, when you can thereby increase that knowledge by which you alleviate the sufferings of man, and enrich--”  “And do not you?”  A gentle smile passed over Pentaur’s face; leaned over the animal and said:  “How curious! the little beast still lives and breathes; a man would have long been dead under such treatment. His organism is perhaps of a more precious, subtle, and so more fragile nature?”  Nebsecht shrugged his shoulders.  “Perhaps!” he said.  “I thought you must know.”  “I--how should I?” asked the leech. “I have told you--they would not even let me try to find out how the hand of a forger moves.”  “Consider, the scripture tells us the passage of the soul depends on the preservation of the body.”  Nebsecht looked up with his cunning little eyes and shrugging his shoulders, said:  “Then no doubt it is so: however these things do not concern me. Do what you like with the souls of men; I seek to know something of their bodies, and patch them when they are damaged as well as may be.”  “Nay-Toth be praised, at least you need not deny that you are master in that art.”     [Toth is the god of the learned and of physicians. The Ibis was    sacred to him, and he was usually represented as Ibis-headed. Ra    created him “a beautiful light to show the name of his evil enemy.”     Originally the Dfoon-god, he became the lord of time and measure.    He is the weigher, the philosopher among the gods, the lord of    writing, of art and of learning. The Greeks called him Hermes    Trismegistus, i.e. threefold or “very great” which was, in fact, in    imitation of the Egyptians, whose name Toth or Techud signified    twofold, in the same way “very great”]  “Who is master,” asked Nebsecht, “excepting God? I can do nothing, nothing at all, and guide my instruments with hardly more certainty than a sculptor condemned to work in the dark.”  “Something like the blind Resu then,” said Pentaur smiling, “who understood painting better than all the painters who could see.”  “In my operations there is a ‘better’ and a ‘worse;’” said Nebsecht, “but there is nothing ‘good.’”  “Then we must be satisfied with the ‘better,’ and I have come to claim it,” said Pentaur.  “Are you ill?”  “Isis be praised, I feel so well that I could uproot a palm-tree, but I would ask you to visit a sick girl. The princess Bent-Anat--”  “The royal family has its own physicians.”  “Let me speak! the princess Bent-Anat has run over a young girl, and the poor child is seriously hurt.”  “Indeed,” said the student reflectively. “Is she over there in the city, or here in the Necropolis?”  “Here. She is in fact the daughter of a paraschites.”  “Of a paraschites?” exclaimed Nebsecht, once more slipping the rabbit under the table, “then I will go.”  “You curious fellow. I believe you expect to find something strange among the unclean folk.”  “That is my affair; but I will go. What is the man’s name?”  “Pinem.”  “There will be nothing to be done with him,” muttered the student, “however--who knows?”  With these words he rose, and opening a tightly closed flask he dropped some strychnine on the nose and in the mouth of the rabbit, which immediately ceased to breathe. Then he laid it in a box and said, “I am ready.”  “But you cannot go out of doors in this stained dress.”  The physician nodded assent, and took from a chest a clean robe, which he was about to throw on over the other! but Pentaur hindered him. “First take off your working dress,” he said laughing. “I will help you. But, by Besa, you have as many coats as an onion.”     [Besa, the god of the toilet of the Egyptians. He was represented    as a deformed pigmy. He led the women to conquest in love, and the    men in war. He was probably of Arab origin.]  Pentaur was known as a mighty laugher among his companions, and his loud voice rung in the quiet room, when he discovered that his friend was about to put a third clean robe over two dirty ones, and wear no less than three dresses at once.  Nebsecht laughed too, and said, “Now I know why my clothes were so heavy, and felt so intolerably hot at noon. While I get rid of my superfluous clothing, will you go and ask the high-priest if I have leave to quit the temple.”  “He commissioned me to send a leech to the paraschites, and added that the girl was to be treated like a queen.”  “Ameni? and did he know that we have to do with a paraschites?”  “Certainly.”  “Then I shall begin to believe that broken limbs may be set with vows-aye, vows! You know I cannot go alone to the sick, because my leather tongue is unable to recite the sentences or to wring rich offerings for the temple from the dying. Go, while I undress, to the prophet Gagabu and beg him to send the pastophorus Teta, who usually accompanies me.”  “I would seek a young assistant rather than that blind old man.”  “Not at all. I should be glad if he would stay at home, and only let his tongue creep after me like an eel or a slug. Head and heart have nothing to do with his wordy operations, and they go on like an ox treading out corn.”     [In Egypt, as in Palestine, beasts trod out the corn, as we learn    from many pictures in the catacombs, even in the remotest ages;    often with the addition of a weighted sledge, to the runners of    which rollers are attached.

Tell him to come and fetch me, and drink some wine. There stands three days’ allowance; in this hot weather it dims my sight.  “Does the paraschites live to the north or south of the Necropolis?”  “I think to the north. Paaker, the king’s pioneer, will show you the way.”  “He!” exclaimed the student, laughing. “What day in the calendar is this, then?     [Calendars have been preserved, the completest is the papyrus    Sallier IV., which has been admirably treated by F. Chabas. Many    days are noted as lucky, unlucky, etc. In the temples many    Calendars of feasts have been found, the most perfect at Medinet    Abu, deciphered by Dumich.]  The child of a paraschites is to be tended like a princess, and a leech have a noble to guide him, like the Pharaoh himself! I ought to have kept on my three robes!”  “The night is warm,” said Pentaur.  “But Paaker has strange ways with him. Only the day before yesterday I was called to a poor boy whose collar bone he had simply smashed with his stick. If I had been the princess’s horse I would rather have trodden him down than a poor little girl.”  “So would I,” said Pentaur laughing, and left the room to request The second prophet Gagabu, who was also the head of the medical staff of the House of Seti, to send the blind pastophorus     [The Pastophori were an order of priests to which the physicians    belonged.]  Teta, with his friend as singer of the litany.     CHAPTER IV.  Pentaur knew where to seek Gagabu, for he himself had been invited to the banquet which the prophet had prepared in honor of two sages who had lately come to the House of Seti from the university of Chennu.     [Chennu was situated on a bend of the Nile, not far from the Nubian    frontier; it is now called Gebel Silsilch; it was in very ancient    times the seat of a celebrated seminary.]  In an open court, surrounded by gaily-painted wooden pillars, and lighted by many lamps, sat the feasting priests in two long rows on comfortable armchairs. Before each stood a little table, and servants were occupied in supplying them with the dishes and drinks, which were laid out on a splendid table in the middle of the court. Joints of gazelle,     [Gazelles were tamed for domestic animals: we find them in the    representations of the herds of the wealthy Egyptians and as    slaughtered for food. The banquet is described from the pictures of    feasts which have been found in the tombs.]  roast geese and ducks, meat pasties, artichokes, asparagus and other vegetables, and various cakes and sweetmeats were carried to the guests, and their beakers well-filled with the choice wines of which there was never any lack in the lofts of the House of Seti.     [Cellars maintain the mean temperature of the climate, and in Egypt    are hot Wine was best preserved in shady and airy lofts.]  In the spaces between the guests stood servants with metal bowls, in which they might wash their hands, and towels of fine linen.  When their hunger was appeased, the wine flowed more freely, and each guest was decked with sweetly-smelling flowers, whose odor was supposed to add to the vivacity of the conversation.  Many of the sharers in this feast wore long, snowwhite garments, and were of the class of the Initiated into the mysteries of the faith, as well as chiefs of the different orders of priests of the House of Seti.  The second prophet, Gagabu, who was to-day charged with the conduct of the feast by Ameni--who on such occasions only showed himself for a few minutes--was a short, stout man with a bald and almost spherical head. His features were those of a man of advancing years, but well-formed, and his smoothly-shaven, plump cheeks were well-rounded. His grey eyes looked out cheerfully and observantly, but had a vivid sparkle when he was excited and began to twitch his thick, sensual mouth.  Close by him stood the vacant, highly-ornamented chair of the high-priest, and next to him sat the priests arrived from Chennu, two tall, dark-colored old men. The remainder of the company was arranged in the order of precedency, which they held in the priests’ colleges, and which bore no relation to their respective ages.  But strictly as the guests were divided with reference to their rank, they mixed without distinction in the conversation.  “We know how to value our call to Thebes,” said the elder of the strangers from Chennu, Tuauf, whose essays were frequently used in the schools,--[Some of them are still in existence]--“for while, on one hand, it brings us into the neighborhood of the Pharaoh, where life, happiness, and safety flourish, on the other it procures us the honor of counting ourselves among your number; for, though the university of Chennu in former times was so happy as to bring up many great men, whom she could call her own, she can no longer compare with the House of Seti. Even Heliopolis and Memphis are behind you; and if I, my humble self, nevertheless venture boldly among you, it is because I ascribe your success as much to the active influence of the Divinity in your temple, which may promote my acquirements and achievements, as to your great gifts and your industry, in which I will not be behind you. I have already seen your high-priest Ameni--what a man! And who does not know thy name, Gagabu, or thine, Meriapu?”  “And which of you,” asked the other new-comer, “may we greet as the author of the most beautiful hymn to Amon, which was ever sung in the land of the Sycamore? Which of you is Pentaur?”  “The empty chair yonder,” answered Gagabu, pointing to a seat at the lower end of the table, “is his. He is the youngest of us all, but a great future awaits him.”  “And his songs,” added the elder of the strangers. “Without doubt,”  replied the chief of the haruspices,--[One of the orders of priests in the Egyptian hierarchy]--an old man with a large grey curly head, that seemed too heavy for his thin neck, which stretched forward--perhaps from the habit of constantly watching for signs--while his prominent eyes glowed with a fanatical gleam. “Without doubt the Gods have granted great gifts to our young friend, but it remains to be proved how he will use them. I perceive a certain freedom of thought in the youth, which pains me deeply. Although in his poems his flexible style certainly follows the prescribed forms, his ideas transcend all tradition; and even in the hymns intended for the ears of the people I find turns of thought, which might well be called treason to the mysteries which only a few months ago he swore to keep secret. For instance he says--and we sing--and the laity hear--         “One only art Thou, Thou Creator of beings;         And Thou only makest all that is created.  And again--          He is one only, Alone, without equal;         Dwelling alone in the holiest of holies.”     [Hymn to Amon preserved in a papyrus roll at Bulaq, and deciphered    by Grehaut and L. Stern.]  Such passages as these ought not to be sung in public, at least in times like ours, when new ideas come in upon us from abroad, like the swarms of locusts from the East.”  “Spoken to my very soul!” cried the treasurer of the temple, “Ameni initiated this boy too early into the mysteries.”  “In my opinion, and I am his teacher,” said Gagabu, “our brotherhood may be proud of a member who adds so brilliantly to the fame of our temple. The people hear the hymns without looking closely at the meaning of the words. I never saw the congregation more devout, than when the beautiful and deeply-felt song of praise was sung at the feast of the stairs.”     [A particularly solemn festival in honor of Amon-Chem, held in the    temple of Medinet-Abu.]  “Pentaur was always thy favorite,” said the former speaker. “Thou wouldst not permit in any one else many things that are allowed to him. His hymns are nevertheless to me and to many others a dangerous performance; and canst thou dispute the fact that we have grounds for grave anxiety, and that things happen and circumstances grow up around us which hinder us, and at last may perhaps crush us, if we do not, while there is yet time, inflexibly oppose them?”  “Thou bringest sand to the desert, and sugar to sprinkle over honey,”  exclaimed Gagabu, and his lips began to twitch. “Nothing is now as it ought to be, and there will be a hard battle to fight; not with the sword, but with this--and this.” And the impatient man touched his forehead and his lips. “And who is there more competent than my disciple? There is the champion of our cause, a second cap of Hor, that overthrew the evil one with winged sunbeams, and you come and would clip his wings and blunt his claws! Alas, alas, my lords! will you never understand that a lion roars louder than a cat, and the sun shines brighter than an oil-lamp? Let Pentuar alone, I say; or you will do as the man did, who, for fear of the toothache, had his sound teeth drawn. Alas, alas, in the years to come we shall have to bite deep into the flesh, till the blood flows, if we wish to escape being eaten up ourselves!”  “The enemy is not unknown to us also,” said the elder priest from Chennu, “although we, on the remote southern frontier of the kingdom, have escaped many evils that in the north have eaten into our body like a cancer. Here foreigners are now hardly looked upon at all as unclean and devilish.”--[“Typhonisch,” belonging to Typhon or Seth.--Translator.]  “Hardly?” exclaimed the chief of the haruspices; “they are invited, caressed, and honored.
