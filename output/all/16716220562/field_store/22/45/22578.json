[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54292"],["title","What Jesus Taught (#8)"],["body","without price.]  Jesus could hardly have told a better story to show what great value God places upon man. It is in perfect accord with many other sayings of His, some of which you should know, Said He, at one time, \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul.\" At another time He said, \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\" In the teaching of Jesus, then, the soul of man--his true life--is beyond any earthly price. Indeed, its value is far beyond the worth of the whole material world.  {71} And Jesus did not place this high value on the soul of any particular man. To Him the souls of all men are priceless. He is no respecter of persons. The Father \"maketh His sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\" There is none so humble that he is beyond the reach of the love of God, nor none so worldly great that he does not need it. Said Jesus, \"Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\"  [Sidenote: Man, the offspring of God.]  It is because Jesus knew and recognized the divine possibilities of every man, great or small, that He thus valued him so highly. Jesus taught always that God is the Father in heaven--and that not figuratively. We are indeed the offspring of God; and being the offspring of God, there resides in all of us the possibility to become gods. Indeed, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, in which we live, it has been revealed that God is Himself an exalted man; that He has Himself passed through such a probationary state as that in which man now lives; and that it is possible for man to become like God. Jesus, likewise, taught this truth to those who heard Him. When the Jews were about to stone Him because He declared Himself the Son of God, Jesus said, \"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are Gods?\" When exhorting the people to live righteous lives, He urged, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" And the disciples caught the meaning of {72} the doctrine; for, wrote John, \"Beloved, now are we the sons of God.\"  [Sidenote: The questions answered.]  Since, then, the soul of man is of such divine origin, and therefore of such surpassing value, we need seek no further for the answer to our questions. The heavenly Father feels the loss of a child even more keenly than does an earthly father. Man is a son of God, and may himself become a god; therefore, God is mindful of him.  [Sidenote: Reverence for God.]  Now, since he is the offspring of the Almighty Father, man owes certain duties both to God and to himself. In the first place, as a faithful and devoted son, he should hold the Father in reverence. \"Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,\" said Jesus, \"Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is His footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.\" The Father of us all is to be held in awe. \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.\"  [Sidenote: Reverence for personal honor.]  In like manner, the value and dignity of man require that he should hold his own personal honor in reverence. His word should be as good as his bond. It should not be necessary to bind a bargain with an oath. Such practice leads easily to profanity. Jesus said also, \"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not {73} make one hair white or black. But let your communications be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\"  [Sidenote: Reverence for personal purity.]  Again, the divine possibilities in him, demand that every man should be willing to make any worldly sacrifice rather than defile his soul with evil. As Jesus put it, The light-of-the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\" \"If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\"  Thus we learn, that, in the teachings of Jesus, man is the crown of creation. He is the noblest work of God. He has in him the possibilities of Godhood. He is indeed the son of God. That is why there has been manifested such unstinted love for him. And that is why man should cultivate sincere reverence for God, and reverence for his own personal honor, and reverence for his own personal purity.  \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\"  (See Shakespeare's Apostrophe to Man in \"Hamlet.\")  {74} THE REFERENCES  John 3:16.

And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said. How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.  \"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat. and be merry: for this my son was dead {78} and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.  \"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come: and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.  \"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgress I at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.  \"And he said unto him. Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\"  [Sidenote: The forgiving Father.]  Of this beautiful parable, the great Dickens said very truly, \"It is the most touching passage in all literature.\" Most people think of it and speak of it as the story of the prodigal son. It is really, however, the story of the forgiving Father. Jesus wanted the Jews to learn to know God as the Father of all men--great and small--and therefore interested in the welfare of all of them. Jesus knew only too well that sin held possession of the lives of the people of His day. He {79} saw plenty of evidence of it. Men were living corrupt lives. Corruption had defiled their minds as well as their bodies. They crowded about the Master to be healed of both mental and physical diseases, that, in many cases, had come upon them because of their sins. Jesus knew, too, that no hope was held out to the sinner in the perverted doctrines of the rabbis. These doctrines made it impossible for the sinner ever to return to the presence of God. But Jesus wanted men to think of God not as a stern, severe, and relentless being, but as a loving and forgiving Father to all men. So, when the younger son of the parable had recognized his sins, had sorrowfully repented of them, and had returned and had confessed them freely, the father forgave them freely, and received him again joyfully into the household. Of course, the prodigal son, though forgiven, would never be able wholly to efface from his soul the marks of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5430"],["title","Preface to a Dictionary of the English Language (#0)"],["body","Harris, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team    PREFACE TO A DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE  By Samuel Johnson    It is the fate of those who toil at the lower employments of life, to be rather driven by the fear of evil, than attracted by the prospect of good; to be exposed to censure, without hope of praise; to be disgraced by miscarriage, or punished for neglect, where success would have been without applause, and diligence without reward.  Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries; whom mankind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of science, the pionier of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress. Every other authour may aspire to praise; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach, and even this negative recompense has been yet granted to very few.  I have, notwithstanding this discouragement, attempted a dictionary of the English language, which, while it was employed in the cultivation of every species of literature, has itself been hitherto neglected; suffered to spread, under the direction of chance, into wild exuberance; resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion; and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation.  When I took the first survey of my undertaking, I found our speech copious without order, and energetick without rules: wherever I turned my view, there was perplexity to be disentangled, and confusion to be regulated; choice was to be made out of boundless variety, without any established principle of selection; adulterations were to be detected, without a settled test of purity; and modes of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages of any writers of classical reputation or acknowledged authority.  Having therefore no assistance but from general grammar, I applied myself to the perusal of our writers; and noting whatever might be of use to ascertain or illustrate any word or phrase, accumulated in time the materials of a dictionary, which, by degrees, I reduced to method, establishing to myself, in the progress of the work, such rules as experience and analogy suggested to me; experience, which practice and observation were continually increasing; and analogy, which, though in some words obscure, was evident in others.  In adjusting the ORTHOGRAPHY, which has been to this time unsettled and fortuitous, I found it necessary to distinguish those irregularities that are inherent in our tongue, and perhaps coeval with it, from others which the ignorance or negligence of later writers has produced. Every language has its anomalies, which, though inconvenient, and in themselves once unnecessary, must be tolerated among the imperfections of human things, and which require only to be registered, that they may not be increased, and ascertained, that they may not be confounded: but every language has likewise its improprieties and absurdities, which it is the duty of the lexicographer to correct or proscribe.  As language was at its beginning merely oral, all words of necessary or common use were spoken before they were written; and while they were unfixed by any visible signs, must have been spoken with great diversity, as we now observe those who cannot read catch sounds imperfectly, and utter them negligently. When this wild and barbarous jargon was first reduced to an alphabet, every penman endeavoured to express, as he could, the sounds which he was accustomed to pronounce or to receive, and vitiated in writing such words as were already vitiated in speech. The powers of the letters, when they were applied to a new language, must have been vague and unsettled, and therefore different hands would exhibit the same sound by different combinations.  From this uncertain pronunciation arise in a great part the various dialects of the same country, which will always be observed to grow fewer, and less different, as books are multiplied; and from this arbitrary representation of sounds by letters, proceeds that diversity of spelling observable in the Saxon remains, and I suppose in the first books of every nation, which perplexes or destroys analogy, and produces anomalous formations, that, being once incorporated, can never be afterward dismissed or reformed.  Of this kind are the derivatives length from long, strength from strong, darling from dear, breadth from broad, from dry, drought, and from high, height, which Milton, in zeal for analogy, writes highth; Quid te exempta juvat spinis de pluribus una [Horace, Epistles, II. ii. 212]; to change all would be too much, and to change one is nothing.  This uncertainty is most frequent in the vowels, which are so capriciously pronounced, and so differently modified, by accident or affectation, not only in every province, but in every mouth, that to them, as is well known to etymologists, little regard is to be shewn in the deduction of one language from another.  Such defects are not errours in orthography, but spots of barbarity impressed so deep in the English language, that criticism can never wash them away: these, therefore, must be permitted to remain untouched; but many words have likewise been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance, as the pronunciation of the vulgar has been weakly followed; and some still continue to be variously written, as authours differ in their care or skill: of these it was proper to enquire the true orthography, which I have always considered as depending on their derivation, and have therefore referred them to their original languages: thus I write enchant, enchantment, enchanter, after the French and incantation after the Latin; thus entire is chosen rather than intire, because it passed to us not from the Latin integer, but from the French entier.  Of many words it is difficult to say whether they were immediately received from the Latin or the French, since at the time when we had dominions in France, we had Latin service in our churches. It is, however, my opinion, that the French generally supplied us; for we have few Latin words, among the terms of domestick use, which are not French; but many French, which are very remote from Latin.  Even in words of which the derivation is apparent, I have been often obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom; thus I write, in compliance with a numberless majority, convey and inveigh, deceit and receipt, fancy and phantom; sometimes the derivative varies from the primitive, as explain and explanation, repeat and repetition.  Some combinations of letters having the same power are used indifferently without any discoverable reason of choice, as in choak, choke; soap, sope; jewel, fuel, and many others; which I have sometimes inserted twice, that those who search for them under either form, may not search in vain.  In examining the orthography of any doubtful word, the mode of spelling by which it is inserted in the series of the dictionary, is to be considered as that to which I give, perhaps not often rashly, the preference. I have left, in the examples, to every authour his own practice unmolested, that the reader may balance suffrages, and judge between us: but this question is not always to be determined by reputed or by real learning; some men, intent upon greater things, have thought little on sounds and derivations; some, knowing in the ancient tongues, have neglected those in which our words are commonly to be sought. Thus Hammond writes fecibleness for feasibleness, because I suppose he imagined it derived immediately from the Latin; and some words, such as dependant, dependent, dependance, dependence, vary their final syllable, as one or another language is present to the writer.  In this part of the work, where caprice has long wantoned without controul, and vanity sought praise by petty reformation, I have endeavoured to proceed with a scholar's reverence for antiquity, and a grammarian's regard to the genius of our tongue. I have attempted few alterations, and among those few, perhaps the greater part is from the modern to the ancient practice; and I hope I may be allowed to recommend to those, whose thoughts have been perhaps employed too anxiously on verbal singularities, not to disturb, upon narrow views, or for minute propriety, the orthography of their fathers. It has been asserted, that for the law to be KNOWN, is of more importance than to be RIGHT. Change, says Hooker, is not made without inconvenience, even from worse to better. There is in constancy and stability a general and lasting advantage, which will always overbalance the slow improvements of gradual correction. Much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions of oral utterance, or copy that which every variation of time or place makes different from itself, and imitate those changes, which will again be changed, while imitation is employed in observing them.  This recommendation of steadiness and uniformity does not proceed from an opinion, that particular combinations of letters have much influence on human happiness; or that truth may not be successfully taught by modes of spelling fanciful And erroneous: I am not yet so lost in lexicography, as to I forget that WORDS ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF EARTH, AND THAT THINGS ARE THE SONS OF HEAVEN.  Language is only the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas: I wish, however, that the instrument might be less apt to decay, and that signs might be permanent, like the things which they denote.  In settling the orthography, I have not wholly neglected the pronunciation, which I have directed, by printing an accent upon the acute or elevated syllable. It will sometimes be found, that the accent is placed by the authour quoted, on a different syllable from that marked in the alphabetical series; it is then to be understood,"]]]
