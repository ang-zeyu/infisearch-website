So far they have been the cement, the refreshing dew of our friendship.\"  \"So long as they treated of ideas only, and not of deeds.\"  \"You intend to get possession of a human heart!\"  cried the poet.  \"Think of what you are doing!  The heart is the vessel of that effluence of the universal soul, which lives in us.\"  \"Are you so sure of that?\"  cried the physician with some irritation, \"then give me the proof.  Have you ever examined a heart, has any one member of my profession done so?  The hearts of criminals and prisoners of war even are declared sacred from touch, and when we stand helpless by a patient, and see our medicines work harm as often as good, why is it? Only because we physicians are expected to work as blindly as an astronomer, if he were required to look at the stars through a board. At Heliopolis I entreated the great Urma Rahotep, the truly learned chief of our craft, and who held me in esteem, to allow me to examine the heart of a dead Amu; but he refused me, because the great Sechet leads virtuous Semites also into the fields of the blessed.       [According to the inscription accompanying the famous      representations of the four nations (Egyptians, Semites, Libyans,      and Ethiopians) in the tomb of Seti I.]  And then followed all the old scruples: that to cut up the heart of a beast even is sinful, because it also is the vehicle of a soul, perhaps a condemned and miserable human soul, which before it can return to the One, must undergo purification by passing through the bodies of animals. I was not satisfied, and declared to him that my great-grandfather Nebsecht, before he wrote his treatise on the heart, must certainly have examined such an organ.  Then he answered me that the divinity had revealed to him what he had written, and therefore his work had been accepted amongst the sacred writings of Toth,       [Called by the Greeks \"Hermetic Books.\"  The Papyrus Ebers is the      work called by Clemens of Alexandria \"the Book of Remedies.\"]  which stood fast and unassailable as the laws of the world; he wished to give me peace for quiet work, and I also, he said, might be a chosen spirit, the divinity might perhaps vouchsafe revelations to me too.  I was young at that time, and spent my nights in prayer, but I only wasted away, and my spirit grew darker instead of clearer.  Then I killed in secret--first a fowl, then rats, then a rabbit, and cut up their hearts, and followed the vessels that lead out of them, and know little more now than I did at first; but I must get to the bottom of the truth, and I must have a human heart.\"  \"What will that do for you?\"  asked Pentaur; \"you cannot hope to perceive the invisible and the infinite with your human eyes?\"  \"Do you know my great-grandfather's treatise?\"  \"A little,\" answered the poet; \"he said that wherever he laid his finger, whether on the head, the hands, or the stomach, he everywhere met with the heart, because its vessels go into all the members, and the heart is the meeting point of all these vessels.  Then Nebsecht proceeds to state how these are distributed in the different members, and shows-- is it not so?--that the various mental states, such as anger, grief, aversion, and also the ordinary use of the word heart, declare entirely for his view.\"  \"That is it.  We have already discussed it, and I believe that he is right, so far as the blood is concerned, and the animal sensations.  But the pure and luminous intelligence in us--that has another seat,\" and the physician struck his broad but low forehead with his hand.  \"I have observed heads by the hundred down at the place of execution, and I have also removed the top of the skulls of living animals.  But now let me write, before we are disturbed.\"       [Human brains are prescribed for a malady of the eyes in the Ebers      papyrus.  Herophilus, one of the first scholars of the Alexandrine      Museum, studied not only the bodies of executed criminals, but made      his experiments also on living malefactors.  He maintained that the      four cavities of the human brain are the seat of the soul.]  The physician took the reed, moistened it with black color prepared from burnt papyrus, and in elegant hieratic characters       [At the time of our narrative the Egyptians had two kinds of      writing-the hieroglyphic, which was generally used for monumental      inscriptions, and in which the letters consisted of conventional      representations of various objects, mathematical and arbitrary      symbols, and the hieratic, used for writing on papyrus, and in      which, with the view of saving time, the written pictures underwent      so many alterations and abbreviations that the originals could      hardly be recognized.  In the 8th century there was a further      abridgment of the hieratic writing, which was called the demotic, or      people's writing, and was used in commerce.  Whilst the hieroglyphic      and hieratic writings laid the foundations of the old sacred      dialect, the demotic letters were only used to write the spoken      language of the people.  E. de Rouge's Chrestomathie Egyptienne.      H.  Brugsch's Hieroglyphische Grammatik.  Le Page Renouf's shorter      hieroglyphical grammar.  Ebers' Ueber das Hieroglyphische      Schriftsystem, 2nd edition, 1875, in the lectures of Virchow      Holtzendorff.]  wrote the paper for the paraschites, in which he confessed to having impelled him to the theft of a heart, and in the most binding manner declared himself willing to take the old man's guilt upon himself before Osiris and the judges of the dead.  When he had finished, Pentaur held out his hand for the paper, but Nebsecht folded it together, placed it in a little bag in which lay an amulet that his dying mother had hung round his neck, and said, breathing deeply:  \"That is done.  Farewell, Pentaur.\"  But the poet held the physician back; he spoke to him with the warmest words, and conjured him to abandon his enterprise.  His prayers, however, had no power to touch Nebsecht, who only strove forcibly to disengage his finger from Pentaur's strong hand, which held him as in a clasp of iron. The excited poet did not remark that he was hurting his friend, until after a new and vain attempt at freeing himself, Nebsecht cried out in pain, \"You are crushing my finger!\"  A smile passed over the poet's face, he loosened his hold on the physician, and stroked the reddened hand like a mother who strives to divert her child from pain.  \"Don't be angry with me, Nebsecht,\" he said, \"you know my unlucky fists, and to-day they really ought to hold you fast, for you have too mad a purpose on hand.\"  \"Mad?\"  said the physician, whilst he smiled in his turn.  \"It may be so; but do you not know that we Egyptians all have a peculiar tenderness for our follies, and are ready to sacrifice house and land to them?\"  \"Our own house and our own land,\" cried the poet: and then added seriously, \"but not the existence, not the happiness of another.\"  \"Have I not told you that I do not look upon the heart as the seat of our intelligence?  So far as I am concerned, I would as soon be buried with a ram's heart as with my own.\"  \"I do not speak of the plundered dead, but of the living,\" said the poet. \"If the deed of the paraschites is discovered, he is undone, and you would only have saved that sweet child in the hut behind there, to fling her into deeper misery.\"  Nebsecht looked at the other with as much astonishment and dismay, as if he had been awakened from sleep by bad tidings.  Then he cried: \"All that I have, I would share with the old man and Uarda.\"  \"And who would protect her?\"  \"Her father.\"  \"That rough drunkard who to-morrow or the day after may be sent no one knows where.\"  \"He is a good fellow,\" said the physician interrupting his friend, and stammering violently.  \"But who 'would do anything to the child?  She is so so ....  She is so charming, so perfectly--sweet and lovely.\"  With these last words he cast down his eyes and reddened like a girl.  \"You understand that,\" he said, \"better than I do; yes, and you also think her beautiful!  Strange! you must not laugh if I confess--I am but a man like every one else--when I confess, that I believe I have at length discovered in myself the missing organ for beauty of form--not believe merely, but truly have discovered it, for it has not only spoken, but cried, raged, till I felt a rushing in my ears, and for the first time was attracted more by the sufferer than by suffering.  I have sat in the hut as though spell-bound, and gazed at her hair, at her eyes, at how she breathed.  They must long since have missed me at the House of Seti, perhaps discovered all my preparations, when seeking me in my room!  For two days and nights I have allowed myself to be drawn away from my work, for the sake of this child.  Were I one of the laity, whom you would approach, I should say that demons had bewitched me.  But it is not that,\"--and with these words the physician's eyes flamed up--\"it is not that!  The animal in me, the low instincts of which the heart is the organ, and which swelled my breast at her bedside, they have mastered the pure and fine emotions here--here in this brain; and in the very moment when I hoped to know as the God knows whom you call the Prince of knowledge, in that moment I must learn that the animal in me is stronger than that which I call my God.\"  The physician, agitated and excited, had fixed his eyes on the ground during these last words, and hardly noticed the poet, who listened to him wondering and full of sympathy.  For a time both were silent; then Pentaur laid his hand on his friend's hand, and said cordially:  \"My soul is no stranger to what you feel, and heart and head, if I may use your own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5442"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 04 (#6)"],["body","s, have known a like emotion.  But I know that what we feel, although it may be foreign to our usual sensations, is loftier and more precious than these, not lower.  Not the animal, Nebsecht, is it that you feel in yourself, but God.  Goodness is the most beautiful attribute of the divine, and you have always been well-disposed towards great and small; but I ask you, have you ever before felt so irresistibly impelled to pour out an ocean of goodness on another being, whether for Uarda you would not more joyfully and more self-forgetfully sacrifice all that you have, and all that you are, than to father and mother and your oldest friend?\"  Nebsecht nodded assentingly.  \"Well then,\" cried Pentaur, \"follow your new and godlike emotion, be good to Uarda and do not sacrifice her to your vain wishes.  My poor friend! With your--enquiries into the secrets of life, you have never looked round upon itself, which spreads open and inviting before our eyes.  Do you imagine that the maiden who can thus inflame the calmest thinker in Thebes, will not be coveted by a hundred of the common herd when her protector fails her?  Need I tell you that amongst the dancers in the foreign quarter nine out of ten are the daughters of outlawed parents? Can you endure the thought that by your hand innocence may be consigned to vice, the rose trodden under foot in the mud?  Is the human heart that you desire, worth an Uarda?  Now go, and to-morrow come again to me your friend who understands how to sympathize with all you feel, and to whom you have approached so much the nearer to-day that you have learned to share his purest happiness.\"  Pentaur held out his hand to the physician, who held it some time, then went thoughtfully and lingeringly, unmindful of the burning glow of the mid-day sun, over the mountain into the valley of the king's graves towards the hut of the paraschites.  Here he found the soldier with his daughter.  \"Where is the old man?\" he asked anxiously.  \"He has gone to his work in the house of the embalmer,\" was the answer. \"If anything should happen to him he bade me tell you not to forget the writing and the book.  He was as though out of his mind when he left us, and put the ram's heart in his bag and took it with him.  Do you remain with the little one; my mother is at work, and I must go with the prisoners of war to Harmontis.\"     CHAPTER XVIII.  While the two friends from the House of Seti were engaged in conversation, Katuti restlessly paced the large open hall of her son-in- law's house, in which we have already seen her.  A snow-white cat followed her steps, now playing with the hem of her long plain dress, and now turning to a large stand on which the dwarf Nemu sat in a heap; where formerly a silver statue had stood, which a few months previously had been sold.  He liked this place, for it put him in a position to look into the eyes of his mistress and other frill-grown people.  \"If you have betrayed me! If you have deceived me!\" said Katuti with a threatening gesture as she passed his perch.  \"Put me on a hook to angle for a crocodile if I have.  But I am curious to know how he will offer you the money.\"  \"You swore to me,\" interrupted his mistress with feverish agitation, that you had not used my name in asking Paaker to save us?\"  \"A thousand times I swear it,\" said the little man.  \"Shall I repeat all our conversation?  I tell thee he will sacrifice his land, and his house-great gate and all, for one friendly glance from Nefert's eyes.\"  \"If only Mena loved her as he does!\"  sighed the widow, and then again she walked up and down the hall in silence, while the dwarf looked out at the garden entrance.  Suddenly she paused in front of Nemu, and said so hoarsely that Nemu shuddered:  \"I wish she were a widow.\"  \"The little man made a gesture as if to protect himself from the evil eye, but at the same instant he slipped down from his pedestal, and exclaimed:  \"There is a chariot, and I hear his big dog barking.  It is he.  Shall I call Nefert?\"  \"No!\"  said Katuti in a low voice, and she clutched at the back of a chair as if for support.  The dwarf shrugged his shoulders, and slunk behind a clump of ornamental plants, and a few minutes later Paaker stood in the presence of Katuti, who greeted him, with quiet dignity and self-possession.  Not a feature of her finely-cut face betrayed her inward agitation, and after the Mohar had greeted her she said with rather patronizing friendliness:  \"I thought that you would come.  Take a seat.  Your heart is like your father's; now that you are friends with us again it is not by halves.\"  Paaker had come to offer his aunt the sum which was necessary for the redemption of her husband's mummy.  He had doubted for a long time whether he should not leave this to his mother, but reserve partly and partly vanity had kept him from doing so.  He liked to display his wealth, and Katuti should learn what he could do, what a son-in-law she had rejected.  He would have preferred to send the gold, which he had resolved to give away, by the hand of one of his slaves, like a tributary prince.  But that could not be done so he put on his finger a ring set with a valuable stone, which king Seti I., had given to his father, and added various clasps and bracelets to his dress.  When, before leaving the house, he looked at himself in a mirror, he said to himself with some satisfaction, that he, as he stood, was worth as much as the whole of Mena's estates.  Since his conversation with Nemu, and the dwarf's interpretation of his dream, the path which he must tread to reach his aim had been plain before him.  Nefert's mother must be won with the gold which would save her from disgrace, and Mena must be sent to the other world.  He relied chiefly on his own reckless obstinacy--which he liked to call firm determination--Nemu's cunning, and the love-philter.  He now approached Katuti with the certainty of success, like a merchant who means to acquire some costly object, and feels that he is rich enough to pay for it.  But his aunt's proud and dignified manner confounded him.  He had pictured her quite otherwise, spirit-broken, and suppliant; and he had expected, and hoped to earn, Nefert's thanks as well as her mother's by his generosity.  Mena's pretty wife was however absent, and Katuti did not send for her even after he had enquired after her health.  The widow made no advances, and some time passed in indifferent conversation, till Paaker abruptly informed her that he had heard of her son's reckless conduct, and had decided, as being his mother's nearest relation, to preserve her from the degradation that threatened her.  For the sake of his bluntness, which she took for honesty, Katuti forgave the magnificence of his dress, which under the circumstances certainly seemed ill-chosen; she thanked him with dignity, but warmly, more for the sake of her children than for her own; for life she said was opening before them, while for her it was drawing to its close.  \"You are still at a good time of life,\" said Paaker.  \"Perhaps at the best,\" replied the widow, \"at any rate from my point of view; regarding life as I do as a charge, a heavy responsibility.\"  \"The administration of this involved estate must give you many, anxious hours--that I understand.\"  Katuti nodded, and then said sadly:  \"I could bear it all, if I were not condemned to see my poor child being brought to misery without being able to help her or advise her.  You once would willingly have married her, and I ask you, was there a maiden in Thebes--nay in all Egypt--to compare with her for beauty?  Was she not worthy to be loved,  and is she not so still?  Does she deserve that her husband should leave her to starve, neglect her, and take a strange woman into his tent as if he had repudiated her?  I see what you feel about it! You throw all the blame on me.  Your heart says: 'Why did she break off our betrothal,' and your right feeling tells you that you would have given her a happier lot.\"  With these words Katuti took her nephew's hand, and went on with increasing warmth.  \"We know you to-day for the most magnanimous man in Thebes, for you have requited injustice with an immense benefaction; but even as a boy you were kind and noble.  Your father's wish has always been dear and sacred to me, for during his lifetime he always behaved to us as an affectionate brother, and I would sooner have sown the seeds of sorrow for myself than for your mother, my beloved sister.  I brought up my child--I guarded her jealously--for the young hero who was absent, proving his valor in Syria --for you and for you only.  Then your father died, my sole stay and protector.\"  \"I know it all!\"  interrupted Paaker looking gloomily at the floor.  \"Who should have told you?\"  said the widow.  \"For your mother, when that had happened which seemed incredible, forbid us her house, and shut her ears.  The king himself urged Mena's suit, for he loves him as his own son, and when I represented your prior claim he commanded;--and who may resist the commands of the sovereign of two worlds, the Son of Ra?  Kings have short memories; how often did your father hazard his life for him, how many wounds had he received in his service.  For your father's sake he might have spared you such an affront, and such pain.\"  \"And have I myself served him, or not?\"  asked the pioneer flushing darkly.  \"He knows you less,\" returned Katuti apologetically.  Then she changed her tone to one of sympathy, and went on:  \"How was it that you, young as you were, aroused his dissatisfaction, his dislike, nay his--\"  \"His what?\"  asked the pioneer, trembling with excitement.  \"Let that pass!\"  said the widow soothingly.  \"The favor and disfavor of kings are as those of the Gods.  Men rejoice in the one or bow to the other.\"  \"What feeling have I aroused in Rameses besides dissatisfaction, and dislike?  I insist on knowing!\"  said Paaker with increasing vehemence.  \"You alarm me,\" the"]]]
