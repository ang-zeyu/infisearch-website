How dignified he looks, but he will not like going.  Now the God is coming, for I, smell the incense.\"  With these words the prince fell on his knees, and the women followed his example--when they saw first a noble bull in whose shining skin the sun was reflected, and who bore between his horns a golden disk, above which stood white ostrich-feathers; and then, divided from the bull only by a few fan-bearers, the God himself, sometimes visible, but more often hidden from sight by great semi-circular screens of black and white ostrich-feathers, which were fixed on long poles, and with which the priests shaded the God.  His mode of progress was as mysterious as his name, for he seemed to float slowly on his gorgeous throne from the temple-gates towards the stream.  His seat was placed on a platform, magnificently decorated with bunches and garlands of flowers, and covered with hangings of purple and gold brocade, which concealed the priests who bore it along with a slow and even pace.  As soon as the God had been placed on board his barge, Bent-Anat and her companions rose from their knees.  Then came some priests, who carried a box with the sacred evergreen tree of Amon; and when a fresh outburst of music fell on her ear, and a cloud of incense was wafted up to her, Bent-Anat said: \"Now my father should be coming.\"  \"And you,\" cried Rameri, \"and close behind, Nefert's husband, Mena, with the guards.  Uncle Ani comes on foot.  How strangely he has dressed himself like a sphinx hind-part before!\"  \"How so?\"  asked Nefert.  \"A sphinx,\" said Rameri laughing, it has the body of a lion, and the head of a man,       [There were no female sphinxes in Egypt.  The sphinx was called Neb,      i. e., the lord.  The lion-couchant had either a man's or a rams      head.]  and my uncle has a peaceful priest's robe, and on his head the helmet of a warrior.\"  \"If the king were here, the distributor of life,\" said Nefert, \"you would not be missing from among his supporters.\"  \"No indeed!\"  replied the prince, \"and the whole thing is altogether different when my father is here.  His heroic form is splendid on his golden throne; the statues of Truth and justice spread their wings behind him as if to protect him; his mighty representative in fight, the lion, lies peacefully before him, and over him spreads the canopy with the Urmus snake at the top.  There is hardly any end to the haruspices, the pastophori with the standards, the images of the Gods, and the flocks and herds for sacrifice.  Only think, even the North has sent representatives to the feast, as if my father were here.  I know all the different signs on the standards.  Do you recognize the images of the king's ancestors, Nefert?  No? no more do I; but it seemed to me that Ahmes I., who expelled the Hyksos--from whom our grandmother was descended--headed the procession, and not my grandfather Seti, as he should have done.  Here come the soldiers; they are the legions which Ani equipped, and who returned victorious from Ethiopia only last night.  How the people cheer them! and indeed they have behaved valiantly.  Only think, Bent-Anat and Nefert, what it will be when my father comes home, with a hundred captive princes, who will humbly follow his chariot, which your Mena will drive, with our brothers and all the nobles of the land, and the guards in their splendid chariots.\"  \"They do not think of returning yet!\"  sighed Nefert.  While more and more troops of the Regent's soldiers, more companies of musicians, and rare animals, followed in procession, the festal bark of Amon started from the shore.  It was a large and gorgeous barge of wood, polished all over and overlaid with gold, and its edge was decorated with glittering glass-beads, which imitated rubies and emeralds; the masts and yards were gilt, and purple sails floated from them.  The seats for the priests were of ivory, and garlands of lilies and roses hung round the vessel, from its masts and ropes.  The Regent's Nile-boat was not less splendid; the wood-work shone with gilding, the cabin was furnished with gay Babylonian carpets; a lion's- head formed the prow, as formerly in Hatasu's sea-going vessels, and two large rubies shone in it, for eyes.  After the priests had embarked, and the sacred barge had reached the opposite shore, the people pressed into the boats, which, filled almost to sinking, soon so covered the whole breadth of the river that there was hardly a spot where the sun was mirrored in the yellow waters.  \"Now I will put on the dress of a gardener,\" cried Rameri, \"and cross over with the wreaths.\"  \"You will leave us alone?\" asked Bent-Anat.  \"Do not make me anxious,\" said Rameri.  \"Go then,\" said the princess.  \"If my father were here how willingly I would go too.\"  \"Come with me,\" cried the boy.  \"We can easily find a disguise for you too.\"  \"Folly!\"  said Bent-Anat; but she looked enquiringly at Nefert, who shrugged her shoulders, as much as to say: \"Your will is my law.\"  Rameri was too sharp for the glances of the friends to have escaped him, and he exclaimed eagerly:  \"You will come with me, I see you will!  Every beggar to-day flings his flower into the common grave, which contains the black mummy of his father--and shall the daughter of Rameses, and the wife of the chief charioteer, be excluded from bringing garlands to their dead?\"  \"I shall defile the tomb by my presence,\" said Bent-Anat coloring.  \"You--you!\"  exclaimed Rameri, throwing his arms round his sister's neck, and kissing her.  \"You, a noble generous creature, who live only to ease sorrow and to wipe away tears; you, the very image of my father--unclean! sooner would I believe that the swans down there are as black as crows, and the rose-wreaths on the balcony rank hemlock branches.  Bek-en-Chunsu pronounced you clean, and if Ameni--\"  \"Ameni only exercises his rights,\" said Bent-Anat gently, \"and you know what we have resolved.  I will not hear one hard word about him to-day.\"  \"Very well!  he has graciously and mercifully kept us from the feast,\" said Rameri ironically, and he bowed low in the direction of the Necropolis, \"and you are unclean.  Do not enter the tombs and the temples on my account; let us stay outside among the people.  The roads over there are not so very sensitive; paraschites and other unclean folks pass over them every day.  Be sensible, Bent-Anat, and come.  We will disguise ourselves; I will conduct you; I will lay the garlands in the tombs, we will pray together outside, we will see the sacred procession and the feats of the magicians, and hear the festive discourse.  Only think! Pentaur, in spite of all they have said against him, is to deliver it. The temple of Seti wants to do its best to-day, and Ameni knows very well that Pentaur, when he opens his mouth, stirs the hearts of the people more than all the sages together if they were to sing in chorus!  Come with me, sister.\"  \"So be it then,\" said Bent-Anat with sudden decision.  Rameri was surprised at this quick resolve, at which however he was delighted; but Nefert looked anxiously at her friend.  In a moment her eyes fell; she knew now who it was that her friend loved, and the fearful thought--\"How will it end?\"  flashed through her mind.     CHAPTER XXVIII.  An hour later a tall, plainly dressed woman crossed the Nile, with a dark-skinned boy and a slender youth by her side.  The wrinkles on her brow and cheeks agreed little with her youthful features; but it would have been difficult to recognize in these three the proud princess, the fair young prince, and the graceful Nefert, who looked as charming as ever in the long white robe of a temple-student.  They were followed by two faithful and sturdy head-servants from among the litter-bearers of the princess, who were however commanded to appear as though they were not in any way connected with their mistress and her companions.  The passage across the Nile had been accomplished but slowly, and thus the royal personages had experienced for the first time some of the many difficulties and delays which ordinary mortals must conquer to attain objects which almost fly to meet their rulers.  No one preceded them to clear the river, no other vessel made way for them; on the contrary, all tried to take place ahead of them, and to reach the opposite shore before them.  When at last they reached the landing-place, the procession had already passed on to the temple of Seti; Ameni had met it with his chorus of singers, and had received the God on the shore of the Nile; the prophets of the Necropolis had with their own hands placed him in the sacred Sam- bark of the House of Seti, which was artistically constructed of cedar wood and electrum set with jewels; thirty pastophori took the precious burden on their shoulders, and bore it up the avenue of Sphinxes--which led from the river to the temple--into the sanctuary of Seti, where Amon remained while the emissaries from the different provinces deposited their offerings in the forecourt.  On his road from the shore kolchytes had run before him, in accordance with ancient custom, strewing sand in his path.  In the course of an hour the procession once more emerged into the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5445"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 07 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      UARDA  Volume 7.  By Georg Ebers    CHAPTER XXIX.  At last the pioneer's boat got off with his mother and the body of the dog, which he intended to send to be embalmed at Kynopolis, the city in which the dog was held sacred above all animals;       [Kynopolis, or in old Egyptian Saka, is now Samalut; Anubis was the      chief divinity worshipped there.  Plutarch relates a quarrel between      the inhabitants of this city, and the neighboring one of Oxyrynchos,      where the fish called Oxyrynchos was worshipped.  It began because      the Kynopolitans eat the fish, and in revenge the Oxyrynchites      caught and killed dogs, and consumed them in sacrifices.  Juvenal      relates a similar story of the Ombites--perhaps Koptites--and      Pentyrites in the 15th Satire.]  Paaker himself returned to the House of Seti, where, in the night which closed the feast day, there was always a grand banquet for the superior priests of the Necropolis and of the temples of eastern Thebes, for the representatives of other foundations, and for select dignitaries of the state.  His father had never failed to attend this entertainment when he was in Thebes, but he himself had to-day for the first time received the much- coveted honor of an invitation, which--Ameni told him when he gave it--he entirely owed to the Regent.  His mother had tied up his hand, which Rameri had severely hurt; it was extremely painful, but he would not have missed the banquet at any cost, although he felt some alarm of the solemn ceremony.  His family was as old as any in Egypt, his blood purer than the king's, and nevertheless he never felt thoroughly at home in the company of superior people.  He was no priest, although a scribe; he was a warrior, and yet he did not rank with royal heroes.  He had been brought up to a strict fulfilment of his duty, and he devoted himself zealously to his calling; but his habits of life were widely different from those of the society in which he had been brought up-- a society of which his handsome, brave, and magnanimous father had been a chief ornament.  He did not cling covetously to his inherited wealth, and the noble attribute of liberality was not strange to him, but the coarseness of his nature showed itself most when he was most lavish, for he was never tired of exacting gratitude from those whom he had attached to him by his gifts, and he thought he had earned the right by his liberality to meet the recipient with roughness or arrogance, according to his humor.  Thus it happened that his best actions procured him not friends but enemies.  Paaker's was, in fact, an ignoble, that is to say, a selfish nature; to shorten his road he trod down flowers as readily as he marched over the sand of the desert.  This characteristic marked him in all things, even in his outward demeanor; in the sound of his voice, in his broad features, in the swaggering gait of his stumpy figure.  In camp he could conduct himself as he pleased; but this was not permissible in the society of his equals in rank; for this reason, and because those faculties of quick remark and repartee, which distinguished them, had been denied to him, he felt uneasy and out of his element when he mixed with them, and he would hardly have accepted Ameni's invitation, if it had not so greatly flattered his vanity.  It was already late; but the banquet did not begin till midnight, for the guests, before it began, assisted at the play which was performed by lamp and torch-light on the sacred lake in the south of the Necropolis, and which represented the history of Isis and Osiris.  When he entered the decorated hall in which the tables were prepared, he found all the guests assembled.  The Regent Ani was present, and sat on Ameni's right at the top of the centre high-table at which several places were unoccupied; for the prophets and the initiated of the temple of Amon had excused themselves from being present.  They were faithful to Rameses and his house; their grey-haired Superior disapproved of Ameni's severity towards the prince and princess, and they regarded the miracle of the sacred heart as a malicious trick of the chiefs of the Necropolis against the great temple of the capital for which Rameses had always shown a preference.  The pioneer went up to the table, where sat the general of the troops that had just returned victorious from Ethiopia, and several other officers of high rank, There was a place vacant next to the general. Paaker fixed his eyes upon this, but when he observed that the officer signed to the one next to him to come a little nearer, the pioneer imagined that each would endeavor to avoid having him for his neighbor, and with an angry glance he turned his back on the table where the warriors sat.  The Mohar was not, in fact, a welcome boon-companion.  \"The wine turns sour when that churl looks at it,\" said the general.  The eyes of all the guests turned on Paaker, who looked round for a seat, and when no one beckoned him to one he felt his blood begin to boil.  He would have liked to leave the banqueting hall at once with a swingeing curse.  He had indeed turned towards the door, when the Regent, who had exchanged a few whispered words with Ameni, called to him, requested him to take the place that had been reserved for him, and pointed to the seat by his side, which had in fact been intended for the high-priest of the temple of Amon.  Paaker bowed low, and took the place of honor, hardly daring to look round the table, lest he should encounter looks of surprise or of mockery.  And yet he had pictured to himself his grandfather Assa, and his father, as somewhere near this place of honor, which had actually often enough been given up to them.  And was he not their descendant and heir?  Was not his mother Setchem of royal race?  Was not the temple of Seti more indebted to him than to any one?  A servant laid a garland of flowers round his shoulders, and another handed him wine and food.  Then he raised his eyes, and met the bright and sparkling glance of Gagabu; he looked quickly down again at the table.  Then the Regent spoke to him, and turning to the other guests mentioned that Paaker was on the point of starting next day for Syria, and resuming his arduous labors as Mohar.  It seemed to Paaker that the Regent was excusing himself for having given him so high a place of honor.  Presently Ani raised his wine-cup, and drank to the happy issue of his reconnoitring-expedition, and a victorious conclusion to every struggle in which the Mohar might engage.  The high-priest then pledged him, and thanked him emphatically in the name of the brethren of the temple, for the noble tract of arable land which he had that morning given them as a votive offering.  A murmur of approbation ran round the tables, and Paaker's timidity began to diminish.  He had kept the wrappings that his mother had applied round his still aching hand.  \"Are you wounded?\"  asked the Regent.  \"Nothing of importance,\" answered the pioneer.  \"I was helping my mother into the boat, and it happened--\"  \"It happened,\" interrupted an old school-fellow of the Mohar's, who himself held a high appointment as officer of the city-watch of Thebes-- \"It happened that an oar or a stake fell on his fingers.\"  \"Is it possible!\"  cried the Regent.  \"And quite a youngster laid hands on him,\" continued the officer.  \"My people told me every detail.  First the boy killed his dog--\"  \"That noble Descher?\"  asked the master of the hunt in a tone of regret. \"Your father was often by my side with that dog at a boar-hunt.\"  Paaker bowed his head; but the officer of the watch, secure in his position and dignity, and taking no notice of the glow of anger which flushed Paaker's face, began again:  \"When the hound lay on the ground, the foolhardy boy struck your dagger out of your hand.\"  \"And did this squabble lead to any disturbance?\"  asked Ameni earnestly.  \"No,\" replied the officer.  \"The feast has passed off to-day with unusual quiet.  If the unlucky interruption to the procession by that crazy paraschites had not occurred, we should have nothing but praise for the populace.  Besides the fighting priest, whom we have handed over to you, only a few thieves have been apprehended, and they belong exclusively to the caste,       [According to Diodorous (I. 80) there was a cast of thieves in      Thebes.  All citizens were obliged to enter their names in a      register, and state where they lived, and the thieves did the same.      The names were enrolled by the \"chief of the thieves,\" and all      stolen goods had to be given up to him.  The person robbed had to      give a written description of the object he had lost, and a      declaration as to when and where he had lost it.  The stolen      property was then easily recovered, and restored to the owner on      the payment of one fourth of its value, which was given to  the      thief.  A similar state of things existed at Cairo within a      comparatively short time.]  so we simply take their booty from them, and let them go.  But say, Paaker, what devil of amiability took possession of you down by the river, that you let the rascal escape unpunished.\"  \"Did you do that?\"  exclaimed Gagabu.  \"Revenge is usually your--\"  Ameni threw so warning a glance at the old man, that he suddenly broke off, and then asked the pioneer: \"How did the struggle begin, and who was the fellow?\"  \"Some insolent people,\" said Paaker, \"wanted to push in front of the boat that was waiting for my mother, and I asserted my rights.  The rascal fell upon me, and killed my dog and--by my Osirian father!--the crocodiles would long since have eaten him if a woman had not come between us, and made herself known to me as Bent-Anat,"]]]
