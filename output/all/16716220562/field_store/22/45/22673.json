The stems were bare for a distance of some fifteen feet--at least on those trees which Perry attempted to ascend, for the suggestion of safety carried by the larger of the forest giants had evidently attracted him to them.  A dozen times he scrambled up the trunks like a huge cat only to fall back to the ground once more, and with each failure he cast a horrified glance over his shoulder at the oncoming brute, simultaneously emitting terror-stricken shrieks that awoke the echoes of the grim forest.  At length he spied a dangling creeper about the bigness of one's wrist, and when I reached the trees he was racing madly up it, hand over hand. He had almost reached the lowest branch of the tree from which the creeper depended when the thing parted beneath his weight and he fell sprawling at my feet.  The misfortune now was no longer amusing, for the beast was already too close to us for comfort.  Seizing Perry by the shoulder I dragged him to his feet, and rushing to a smaller tree--one that he could easily encircle with his arms and legs--I boosted him as far up as I could, and then left him to his fate, for a glance over my shoulder revealed the awful beast almost upon me.  It was the great size of the thing alone that saved me.  Its enormous bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet to cope with the agility of my young muscles, and so I was enabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind it before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit.  The few seconds of grace that this gave me found me safely lodged in the branches of a tree a few paces from that in which Perry had at last found a haven.  Did I say safely lodged?  At the time I thought we were quite safe, and so did Perry.  He was praying--raising his voice in thanksgiving at our deliverance--and had just completed a sort of paeon of gratitude that the thing couldn't climb a tree when without warning it reared up beneath him on its enormous tail and hind feet, and reached those fearfully armed paws quite to the branch upon which he crouched.  The accompanying roar was all but drowned in Perry's scream of fright, and he came near tumbling headlong into the gaping jaws beneath him, so precipitate was his impetuous haste to vacate the dangerous limb.  It was with a deep sigh of relief that I saw him gain a higher branch in safety.  And then the brute did that which froze us both anew with horror. Grasping the tree's stem with his powerful paws he dragged down with all the great weight of his huge bulk and all the irresistible force of those mighty muscles.  Slowly, but surely, the stem began to bend toward him.  Inch by inch he worked his paws upward as the tree leaned more and more from the perpendicular.  Perry clung chattering in a panic of terror.  Higher and higher into the bending and swaying tree he clambered.  More and more rapidly was the tree top inclining toward the ground.  I saw now why the great brute was armed with such enormous paws.  The use that he was putting them to was precisely that for which nature had intended them.  The sloth-like creature was herbivorous, and to feed that mighty carcass entire trees must be stripped of their foliage. The reason for its attacking us might easily be accounted for on the supposition of an ugly disposition such as that which the fierce and stupid rhinoceros of Africa possesses.  But these were later reflections.  At the moment I was too frantic with apprehension on Perry's behalf to consider aught other than a means to save him from the death that loomed so close.  Realizing that I could outdistance the clumsy brute in the open, I dropped from my leafy sanctuary intent only on distracting the thing's attention from Perry long enough to enable the old man to gain the safety of a larger tree.  There were many close by which not even the terrific strength of that titanic monster could bend.  As I touched the ground I snatched a broken limb from the tangled mass that matted the jungle-like floor of the forest and, leaping unnoticed behind the shaggy back, dealt the brute a terrific blow.  My plan worked like magic.  From the previous slowness of the beast I had been led to look for no such marvelous agility as he now displayed. Releasing his hold upon the tree he dropped on all fours and at the same time swung his great, wicked tail with a force that would have broken every bone in my body had it struck me; but, fortunately, I had turned to flee at the very instant that I felt my blow land upon the towering back.  As it started in pursuit of me I made the mistake of running along the edge of the forest rather than making for the open beach.  In a moment I was knee-deep in rotting vegetation, and the awful thing behind me was gaining rapidly as I floundered and fell in my efforts to extricate myself.  A fallen log gave me an instant's advantage, for climbing upon it I leaped to another a few paces farther on, and in this way was able to keep clear of the mush that carpeted the surrounding ground.  But the zigzag course that this necessitated was placing such a heavy handicap upon me that my pursuer was steadily gaining upon me.  Suddenly from behind I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp, piercing barks--much the sound that a pack of wolves raises when in full cry. Involuntarily I glanced backward to discover the origin of this new and menacing note with the result that I missed my footing and went sprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck.  My mammoth enemy was so close by this time that I knew I must feel the weight of one of his terrible paws before I could rise, but to my surprise the blow did not fall upon me.  The howling and snapping and barking of the new element which had been infused into the melee now seemed centered quite close behind me, and as I raised myself upon my hands and glanced around I saw what it was that had distracted the DYRYTH, as I afterward learned the thing is called, from my trail.  It was surrounded by a pack of some hundred wolf-like creatures--wild dogs they seemed--that rushed growling and snapping in upon it from all sides, so that they sank their white fangs into the slow brute and were away again before it could reach them with its huge paws or sweeping tail.  But these were not all that my startled eyes perceived.  Chattering and gibbering through the lower branches of the trees came a company of manlike creatures evidently urging on the dog pack.  They were to all appearances strikingly similar in aspect to the Negro of Africa.  Their skins were very black, and their features much like those of the more pronounced Negroid type except that the head receded more rapidly above the eyes, leaving little or no forehead.  Their arms were rather longer and their legs shorter in proportion to the torso than in man, and later I noticed that their great toes protruded at right angles from their feet--because of their arboreal habits, I presume.  Behind them trailed long, slender tails which they used in climbing quite as much as they did either their hands or feet.  I had stumbled to my feet the moment that I discovered that the wolf-dogs were holding the dyryth at bay.  At sight of me several of the savage creatures left off worrying the great brute to come slinking with bared fangs toward me, and as I turned to run toward the trees again to seek safety among the lower branches, I saw a number of the man-apes leaping and chattering in the foliage of the nearest tree.  Between them and the beasts behind me there was little choice, but at least there was a doubt as to the reception these grotesque parodies on humanity would accord me, while there was none as to the fate which awaited me beneath the grinning fangs of my fierce pursuers.  And so I raced on toward the trees intending to pass beneath that which held the man-things and take refuge in another farther on; but the wolf-dogs were very close behind me--so close that I had despaired of escaping them, when one of the creatures in the tree above swung down headforemost, his tail looped about a great limb, and grasping me beneath my armpits swung me in safety up among his fellows.  There they fell to examining me with the utmost excitement and curiosity.  They picked at my clothing, my hair, and my flesh.  They turned me about to see if I had a tail, and when they discovered that I was not so equipped they fell into roars of laughter.  Their teeth were very large and white and even, except for the upper canines which were a trifle longer than the others--protruding just a bit when the mouth was closed.  When they had examined me for a few moments one of them discovered that my clothing was not a part of me, with the result that garment by garment they tore it from me amidst peals of the wildest laughter. Apelike, they essayed to don the apparel themselves, but their ingenuity was not sufficient to the task and so they gave it up.  In the meantime I had been straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of Perry, but nowhere about could I see him, although the clump of trees in which he had first taken refuge was in full view.  I was much exercised by fear that something had befallen him, and though I called his name aloud several times there was no response.  Tired at last of playing with my clothing the creatures threw it to the ground, and catching me, one on either side, by an arm, started off at a most terrifying pace through the tree tops.  Never have I experienced such a journey before or since--even now I oftentimes awake from a deep sleep haunted by the horrid remembrance of that awful experience.  From tree to tree the agile creatures sprang like flying squirrels, while the cold sweat stood upon my brow as I glimpsed the depths beneath, into which a single misstep on the part of either of my bearers would hurl me.  As they bore me along, my mind was occupied with a thousand bewildering thoughts."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/545"],["title","At the Earth's Core (#4)"],["body","  What had become of Perry?  Would I ever see him again?  What were the intentions of these half-human things into whose hands I had fallen?  Were they inhabitants of the same world into which I had been born?  No!  It could not be.  But yet where else?  I had not left that earth--of that I was sure.  Still neither could I reconcile the things which I had seen to a belief that I was still in the world of my birth.  With a sigh I gave it up.     III  A CHANGE OF MASTERS   We must have traveled several miles through the dark and dismal wood when we came suddenly upon a dense village built high among the branches of the trees.  As we approached it my escort broke into wild shouting which was immediately answered from within, and a moment later a swarm of creatures of the same strange race as those who had captured me poured out to meet us.  Again I was the center of a wildly chattering horde.  I was pulled this way and that.  Pinched, pounded, and thumped until I was black and blue, yet I do not think that their treatment was dictated by either cruelty or malice--I was a curiosity, a freak, a new plaything, and their childish minds required the added evidence of all their senses to back up the testimony of their eyes.  Presently they dragged me within the village, which consisted of several hundred rude shelters of boughs and leaves supported upon the branches of the trees.  Between the huts, which sometimes formed crooked streets, were dead branches and the trunks of small trees which connected the huts upon one tree to those within adjoining trees; the whole network of huts and pathways forming an almost solid flooring a good fifty feet above the ground.  I wondered why these agile creatures required connecting bridges between the trees, but later when I saw the motley aggregation of half-savage beasts which they kept within their village I realized the necessity for the pathways.  There were a number of the same vicious wolf-dogs which we had left worrying the dyryth, and many goatlike animals whose distended udders explained the reasons for their presence.  My guard halted before one of the huts into which I was pushed; then two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance--to prevent my escape, doubtless.  Though where I should have escaped to I certainly had not the remotest conception.  I had no more than entered the dark shadows of the interior than there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice, in prayer.  \"Perry!\" I cried.  \"Dear old Perry!  Thank the Lord you are safe.\"  \"David!  Can it be possible that you escaped?\" And the old man stumbled toward me and threw his arms about me.  He had seen me fall before the dyryth, and then he had been seized by a number of the ape-creatures and borne through the tree tops to their village.  His captors had been as inquisitive as to his strange clothing as had mine, with the same result.  As we looked at each other we could not help but laugh.  \"With a tail, David,\" remarked Perry, \"you would make a very handsome ape.\"  \"Maybe we can borrow a couple,\" I rejoined.  \"They seem to be quite the thing this season.  I wonder what the creatures intend doing with us, Perry.  They don't seem really savage.  What do you suppose they can be?  You were about to tell me where we are when that great hairy frigate bore down upon us--have you really any idea at all?\"  \"Yes, David,\" he replied, \"I know precisely where we are.  We have made a magnificent discovery, my boy!  We have proved that the earth is hollow.  We have passed entirely through its crust to the inner world.\"  \"Perry, you are mad!\"  \"Not at all, David.  For two hundred and fifty miles our prospector bore us through the crust beneath our outer world.  At that point it reached the center of gravity of the five-hundred-mile-thick crust.  Up to that point we had been descending--direction is, of course, merely relative.  Then at the moment that our seats revolved--the thing that made you believe that we had turned about and were speeding upward--we passed the center of gravity and, though we did not alter the direction of our progress, yet we were in reality moving upward--toward the surface of the inner world.  Does not the strange fauna and flora which we have seen convince you that you are not in the world of your birth? And the horizon--could it present the strange aspects which we both noted unless we were indeed standing upon the inside surface of a sphere?\"  \"But the sun, Perry!\" I urged.  \"How in the world can the sun shine through five hundred miles of solid crust?\"  \"It is not the sun of the outer world that we see here.  It is another sun--an entirely different sun--that casts its eternal noonday effulgence upon the face of the inner world.  Look at it now, David--if you can see it from the doorway of this hut--and you will see that it is still in the exact center of the heavens.  We have been here for many hours--yet it is still noon.  \"And withal it is very simple, David.  The earth was once a nebulous mass.  It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.  At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface--a sort of shell; but within it was partially molten matter and highly expanded gases.  As it continued to cool, what happened?  Centrifugal force burled the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state.  You have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern cream separator.  Presently there was only a small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases.  The equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe.  What remains of it is the sun you saw today--a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth.  Equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat.  \"This inner world must have cooled sufficiently to support animal life long ages after life appeared upon the outer crust, but that the same agencies were at work here is evident from the similar forms of both animal and vegetable creation which we have already seen.  Take the great beast which attacked us, for example.  Unquestionably a counterpart of the Megatherium of the post-Pliocene period of the outer crust, whose fossilized skeleton has been found in South America.\"  \"But the grotesque inhabitants of this forest?\" I urged.  \"Surely they have no counterpart in the earth's history.\"  \"Who can tell?\" he rejoined.  \"They may constitute the link between ape and man, all traces of which have been swallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked the outer crust, or they may be merely the result of evolution along slightly different lines--either is quite possible.\"  Further speculation was interrupted by the appearance of several of our captors before the entrance of the hut.  Two of them entered and dragged us forth.  The perilous pathways and the surrounding trees were filled with the black ape-men, their females, and their young.  There was not an ornament, a weapon, or a garment among the lot.  \"Quite low in the scale of creation,\" commented Perry.  \"Quite high enough to play the deuce with us, though,\" I replied.  \"Now what do you suppose they intend doing with us?\"  We were not long in learning.  As on the occasion of our trip to the village we were seized by a couple of the powerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops, while about us and in our wake raced a chattering, jabbering, grinning horde of sleek, black ape-things.  Twice my bearers missed their footing, and my heart ceased beating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled deadwood beneath. But on both occasions those lithe, powerful tails reached out and found sustaining branches, nor did either of the creatures loosen their grasp upon me.  In fact, it seemed that the incidents were of no greater moment to them than would be the stubbing of one's toe at a street crossing in the outer world--they but laughed uproariously and sped on with me.  For some time they continued through the forest--how long I could not guess for I was learning, what was later borne very forcefully to my mind, that time ceases to be a factor the moment means for measuring it cease to exist.  Our watches were gone, and we were living beneath a stationary sun.  Already I was puzzled to compute the period of time which had elapsed since we broke through the crust of the inner world. It might be hours, or it might be days--who in the world could tell where it was always noon!  By the sun, no time had elapsed--but my judgment told me that we must have been several hours in this strange world.  Presently the forest terminated, and we came out upon a level plain.  A short distance before us rose a few low, rocky hills.  Toward these our captors urged us, and after a short time led us through a narrow pass into a tiny, circular valley.  Here they got down to work, and we were soon convinced that if we were not to die to make a Roman holiday, we were to die for some other purpose.  The attitude of our captors altered immediately as they entered the natural arena within the rocky hills.  Their laughter ceased.  Grim ferocity marked their bestial faces--bared fangs menaced us.  We were placed in the center of the amphitheater--the thousand creatures forming a great ring about us.  Then a wolf-dog was brought--hyaenodon Perry called it--and turned loose with us inside the circle.  The thing's body was as large as that of a full-grown mastiff, its legs were short and powerful, and its jaws broad and strong.  Dark, shaggy hair covered its back and sides, while its breast and belly were quite white.  As it slunk toward us it presented a most formidable aspect with its upcurled lips baring its mighty fangs.  Perry was on his knees, praying.  I stooped and picked up a small stone.
