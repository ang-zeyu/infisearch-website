One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.  After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.  At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.  Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued.  Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.  “If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”  “Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.  After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.     Chapter X The Guardian of the Gate   It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.  “I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”  Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:  “I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?”  “We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”  So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.  The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.  “This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.”  “Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”  “I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.”  So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.  A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”  “We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.”  “Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.  “Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.”  “Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep.”  So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:  “Where are you all going?”  “To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”  “Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”  “Why not?” she replied.  “Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”  “Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.  “Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”  “What is he like?” asked the girl.  “That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”  “That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”  “Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.  “I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.  “Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more brains than he needs.”  “And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.  “That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”  “And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.  “Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man, “which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you some.”  “And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.  “Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.  “I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and I’m sure it’s somewhere.”  “Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.  The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.  The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.  The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.  “That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.  As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.  In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.  There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.  Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.  When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish in the Emerald City?”  “We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.  The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.  “It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said, shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5501"],["title","Serapis — Volume 01 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      SERAPIS  By Georg Ebers  Volume 1.    Translated from the German by Clara Bell     SERAPIS.  CHAPTER I.  The busy turmoil of the town had been hushed for some hours; the moon and stars were keeping silent watch over Alexandria, and many of the inhabitants were already in the land of dreams. It was deliciously fresh --a truly gracious night; but, though peace reigned in the streets and alleys, even now there was in this pause for rest a lack of the soothing calm which refreshes and renews the spirit of man. For some few weeks there had been an oppressive and fevered tension in the repose of night. Every house and shop was closed as securely as though it were done, not only to secure slumber against intrusion, but to protect life and property from the spoiler; and instead of tones of jollity and mirth the sleeping city echoed the heavy steps and ringing arms of soldiers.  Now and again, when the Roman word of command or the excited cry of some sleepless monk broke the silence, shops and doors were cautiously opened and an anxious face peered out, while belated wanderers shrunk into gateways or under the black shadow of a wall as the watch came past.  A mysterious burden weighed on the Heart of the busy city and clicked its pulses, as a nightmare oppresses the dreamer.  On this night of the year of our Lord 391, in a narrow street leading from the commercial harbor known as Kibotus, an old man was slinking along close to the houses.  His clothes were plain but decent, and he walked with his head bent forward looking anxiously on all sides; when the patrol came by he shrank into the shadow; though he was no thief he had his reasons for keeping out of the way of the soldiery, for the inhabitants, whether natives or strangers, were forbidden to appear in the streets after the harbor was closed for the night.  He stopped in front of a large house, whose long, windowless wall extended from one side street to the next, and pausing before the great gate, he read an inscription on which the light fell from a lamp above: The House of the Holy Martyr.  His widow here offers shelter to all who need it.  He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.\"  \"At how much per cent I wonder?\"  mattered the old man and a satirical smile curled his bearuless lips.  A heavy thud with the knocker rang through the silent street, and after a few short questions from within and equally curt replies from without, a small door was opened in the great gate.  The stranger was on the point of crossing the vestibule when a human creature crept up to him on all fours, and clutched his ancle with a strong hand, exclaiming in a hoarse voice: \"As soon as the door is shut--an entrance fee; for the poor, you know.\"  The old man flung a copper piece to the gatekeeper who tried it, and then, holding on to the rope by which he was tied to a post like a watch- dog, he whined out \"Not a drop to wet a Christian's lips?\"  \"It has not rained for some time,\" retorted the stranger, who proceeded to open a second door which led into a vast court-yard open to the blue vault of heaven.  A few torches stuck against the pillars and a small fire on the pavement added thin smoky, flickering light to the clear glory of the stars, and the whole quadrangle was full of a heavy, reeking atmosphere, compounded of smoke and the steam of hot food.  Even in the street the wanderer had heard the dull buzz and roar which now met his ear as a loud medley of noises and voices, rising from hundreds of men who were encamped in the wide space before him--in groups or singly, sleeping and snoring, or quarrelling, eating, talking and singing as they squatted on the ground which was strewn with straw.  The inn was full, and more than half of the humble guests were monks who, during the last two days, had flowed into the city from every Cenoby, Laura and hermitage in the desert, and from most of the monasteries in the surrounding district--the 'Nitriote Nome'.  Some of them had laid their heads close together for confidential whispering, others squabbled loudly, and a large group in the northern angle of the court had raised a psalm  which  mingled strangely with the \"three,\" \"four,\" \"seven,\" of the men who were playing 'mora', and the cry of the cook inviting purchasers to his stall spread with meat, bread, and onions.  At the end of the court furthest from the gateway there was a covered way, on to which a row of doors opened leading to the rooms devoted to families of women and children, each apartment being divided into two by a curtain across the middle.  The stranger made his way into one of these rooms, where he was warmly welcomed by a young man, who was occupied in cutting a Kopais reed into a mouth-piece for a double flute, and by a tall matronly woman.  The new-comer's name was Karnis and he was the head of a family of wandering singers who had arrived in Alexandria only the day before from Rome.  His surroundings were poor and mean, for their ship had been attacked off the African coast by a band of pirates, and though they had saved their lives they had lost everything they possessed.  The young owner of the vessel, to whom he owed his safety, had procured him admission to this Xenodochium,--[a refuge or inn]--kept by his mother the Widow Mary; Karnis had, however, found it far from comfortable, and had gone forth at noon to seek other quarters.  \"All in vain!\"  said he, as he wiped the heat drops from his forehead. \"I have hunted Medius half the city through and found him at last at the house of Posidonius the Magian, whose assistant he is.  There was singing behind a curtain--wretched rubbish; but there were some old airs too with an accompaniment on the flutes, in the style of Olympus, and really not so bad.  \"Then spirits appeared.  By Sirius a queer business altogether!  Medius is in the midst of it all.  I arranged the chorus and sang with them a little.  All I got for it was a little dirty silver--there!  But as for a lodging--free quarters!--there are none to be found here for anything above an owl; and then there is the edict--that cursed edict!\"  During this speech the younger man had exchanged meaning glances with his mother.  He now interrupted Karnis, saying in a tone of encouragement:  \"Never mind, father; we have something good in view.\"  \"You have?\"  said the old man with an incredulous shrug, while his wife served him with a small roast chicken, on a stool which did duty for a table.  \"Yes father, we!\" the lad went on, laying aside his knife.  \"You know we vowed an offering to Dionysus for our escape, since he himself once fell into the hands of pirates, so we went at once to his temple.  Mother knew the way; and as we--she, I mean, and Dada and myself. . .\"  \"Heh! what is this?\"  interrupted Karnis, now for the first time noticing the dish before him.  \"A fowl--when we are so miserably poor?  A whole fowl, and cooked with oil?\"  He spoke angrily, but his wife, laying her hand on his shoulder, said soothingly:  \"We shall soon earn it again.  Never a sesterce was won by fretting. Enjoy to-day's gifts and the gods will provide for to-morrow.\"  \"Indeed?\" asked Karnis in an altered key.  \"To be sure when a roast fowl flies into one's mouth instead of a pigeon ...  But you are right as usual, Herse, as usual, only--here am I battening like a senator while you--I lay a wager you have drunk nothing but milk all day and eaten nothing but bread and radishes.  I thought so?  Then the chicken must pretend to be a pheasant and you, wife, will eat this leg.  The girls are gone to bed?  Why here is some wine too!  Fill up your cup, boy.  A libation to the God!  Glory to Dionysus !\"  The two men poured the libation on the floor and drank; then the father thrust his knife into the breast of the bird and began his meal with a will, while Orpheus, the son, went on with his story:  \"Well, the temple of Dionysus was not to be found, for Bishop Theophilus has had it destroyed; so to what divinity could we offer our wreath and cake?  Here in Egypt there is none but the great Mother Isis.  Her sanctuary is on the shore of Lake Mareotis and mother found it at once. There she fell into conversation with a priestess who, as soon as she learnt that my mother belonged to a family of musicians--though Dame Herse was cautious in announcing this fact--and hoped to find employment in Alexandria, led her away to a young lady who was closely veiled.  This lady,\" Orpheus went on--he not only played the flute but took the higher parts for a man's voice and could also strike the lyre--\"desired us to go to her later at her own house, where she would speak with us.  She drove off in a fine carriage and we, of course followed her orders; Agne was with us too.  A splendid house!  I never saw anything handsomer in Rome or Antioch.  We were kindly received, and with the lady there were another very old lady and a tall grave man, a priest I should fancy or a philosopher, or something of that kind.\"  \"Not some Christian trap?\"  asked Karnis suspiciously.  \"You do not know this place, and since the edict. . .\"  \"Never fear, father!  There were images of the gods in the halls and corridors, and in the room where we were received by Gorgo, the beautiful daughter of Porphyrius, there was an altar before an image of Isis, quite freshly anointed.--This Porphyrius is a very rich merchant; we learnt that afterwards, and many other things.  The philosopher asked us at once whether we were aware that Theodosius had lately promulgated a new edict forbidding young maidens to appear in public as singers or flute- players.\"  \"And did Agne hear that?\"  said the old man in a low voice as he pointed to the curtain.  \"No, she and Dada were in the garden on to which the room"]]]
