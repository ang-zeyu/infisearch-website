At any rate the necessary deduction must be that the life of man ends in that nothingness whence everything in existence has proceeded.  To live and to die according to this book is not highly profitable.  I can easily reconcile myself to the idea of annihilation, as a man who knows how to value a dreamless sleep after a day brimful of enjoyment--as a man who if he must cease to be Euergetes would rather spring into the open jaws of nothingness--but as a philosopher, no, never!\"  \"You, it is true,\" replied the queen, \"cannot help measuring all and everything by the intellectual standard exclusively; for the gods, who endowed you with gifts beyond a thousand others, struck with blindness or deafness that organ which conveys to our minds any religious or moral sentiment.  If that could see or hear, you could no more exclude the conviction that these writings are full of the deepest purport than I can, nor doubt that they have a powerful hold on the mind of the reader.  \"They fetter their adherents to a fixed law, but they take all bitterness out of sorrow by teaching that a stern father sends us suffering which is represented as being sometimes a means of education, and sometimes a punishment for transgressing a hard and clearly defined law.  Their god, in his infallible but stern wisdom, sets those who cling to him on an evil and stony path to prove their strength, and to let them at last reach the glorious goal which is revealed to them from the beginning.\"  \"How strange such words as these sound in the mouth of a Greek,\" interrupted Euergetes.  \"You certainly must be repeating them after the son of the Jewish high-priest, who defends the cause of his cruel god with so much warmth and skill.\"  \"I should have thought,\" retorted Cleopatra, \"that this overwhelming figure of a god would have pleased you, of all men; for I know of no weakness in you.  Quite lately Dositheos, the Jewish centurion--a very learned man--tried to describe to my husband the one great god to whom his nation adheres with such obstinate fidelity, but I could not help thinking of our beautiful and happy gods as a gay company of amorous lords and pleasure-loving ladies, and comparing them with this stern and powerful being who, if only he chose to do it, might swallow them all up, as Chronos swallowed his own children.\"  \"That,\" exclaimed Euergetes, \"is exactly what most provokes me in this superstition.  It crushes our light-hearted pleasure in life, and whenever I have been reading the book of the Hebrews everything has come into my mind that I least like to think of.  It is like an importunate creditor that reminds us of our forgotten debts, and I love pleasure and hate an importunate reminder. And you, pretty one, life blooms for you--\"  \"But  I,\" interrupted  Cleopatra, \"I can  admire all that is great; and does it not seem a bold and grand thing even to you, that the mighty idea that it is one single power that moves and fills the world, should be freely and openly declared in the sacred writings of the Jews--an idea which the Egyptians carefully wrap up and conceal, which the priests of the Nile only venture to divulge to the most privileged of those who are initiated into their mysteries, and which--though the Greek philosophers indeed have fearlessly uttered it--has never been introduced by any Hellene into the religion of the people?  If you were not so averse to the Hebrew nation, and if you, like my husband and myself, had diligently occupied yourself with their concerns and their belief you would be juster to them and to their scriptures, and to the great creating and preserving spirit, their god--\"  \"You are confounding this jealous and most unamiable and ill-tempered tyrant of the universe with the Absolute of Aristotle!\" cried Euergetes; \"he stigmatises most of what you and I and all rational Greeks require for the enjoyment of life as sin--sin upon sin.  And yet if my easily persuadable brother governed at Alexandria, I believe the shrewd priests might succeed in stamping him as a worshipper of that magnified schoolmaster, who punishes his untutored brood with fire and torment.\"  \"I cannot deny,\" replied Cleopatra, \"that even to me the doctrine of the Jews has something very fearful in it, and that to adopt it seems to me tantamount to confiscating all the pleasures of life.--But enough of such things, which I should no more relish as a daily food than you do. Let us rejoice in that we are Hellenes, and let us now go to the banquet. I fear you have found a very unsatisfactory substitute for what you sought in coming up here.\"  \"No--no.  I feel strangely excited to-day, and my work with Aristarchus would have led to no issue.  It is a pity that we should have begun to talk of that barbarian rubbish; there are so many other subjects more pleasing and more cheering to the mind.  Do you remember how we used to read the great tragedians and Plato together?\"  \"And how you would often interrupt our tutor Agatharchides in his lectures on geography, to point out some mistake!  Did you prosecute those studies in Cyrene?\"  \"Of course.  It really is a pity, Cleopatra, that we should no longer live together as we did formerly.  There is no one, not even Aristarchus, with whom I find it more pleasant and profitable to converse and discuss than with you.  If only you had lived at Athens in the time of Pericles, who knows if you might not have been his friend instead of the immortal Aspasia.  This Memphis is certainly not the right place for you; for a few months in the year you ought to come to Alexandria, which has now risen to be superior to Athens.\"  \"I do not know you to-day!\"  exclaimed Cleopatra, gazing at her brother in astonishment.  \"I have never heard you speak so kindly and brotherly since the death of my mother.  You must have some great request to make of us.\"  \"You see how thankless a thing it is for me to let my heart speak for once, like other people.  I am like the boy in the fable when the wolf came!  I have so often behaved in an unbrotherly fashion that when I show the aspect of a brother you think I have put on a mask.  If I had had anything special to ask of you I should have waited till to-morrow, for in this part of the country even a blind beggar does not like to refuse his lame comrade anything on his birthday.\"  \"If only we knew what you wish for!  Philometor and I would do it more than gladly, although you always want something monstrous.  Our performance to-morrow will--at any rate--but--Zoe, pray be good enough to retire with the maids; I have a few words to say to my brother alone.\"  As soon as the queen's ladies had withdrawn, she went on:  \"It is a real grief to use, but the best part of the festival in honor of your birthday will not be particularly successful, for the priests of Serapis spitefully refuse us the Hebe about whom Lysias has made us so curious.  Asclepiodorus, it would seem, keeps her in concealment, and carries his audacity so far as to tell us that someone has carried her off from the temple.  He insinuates that we have stolen her, and demands her restitution in the name of all his associates.\"  \"You are doing the man an injustice; our dove has followed the lure of a dove-catcher who will not allow me to have her, and who is now billing and cooing with her in his own nest.  I am cheated, but I can scarcely be angry with the Roman, for his claim was of older standing than mine.\"  \"The Roman?\"  asked Cleopatra, rising from her seat and turning pale. \"But that is impossible.  You are making common cause with Eulaeus, and want to set me against Publius Scipio.  At the banquet last night you showed plainly enough your ill-feeling against him.\"  \"You seem to feel more warmly towards him.  But before I prove to you that I am neither lying nor joking, may I enquire what has this man, this many-named Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, to recommend him above any handsome well-grown Macedonian, who is resolute in my cause, in the whole corps of your body guard, excepting his patrician pride?  He is as bitter and ungenial as a sour apple, and all the very best that you--a subtle thinker, a brilliant and cultivated philosopher--can find to say is no more appreciated by his meanly cultivated intellect than the odes of Sappho by a Nubian boatman.\"  \"It is exactly for that,\" cried the queen, \"that I value him; he is different from all of us; we who--how shall I express myself--who always think at second-hand, and always set our foot in the rut trodden by the master of the school we adhere to; who squeeze our minds into the moulds that others have carved out, and when we speak hesitate to step beyond the outlines of those figures of rhetoric which we learned at school! You have burst these bonds, but even your mighty spirit still shows traces of them.  Publius Scipio, on the contrary, thinks and sees and speaks with perfect independence, and his upright sense guides him to the truth without any trouble or special training.  His society revives me like the fresh air that I breathe when I come out into the open air from the temple filled with the smoke of incense--like the milk and bread which a peasant offered us during our late excursion to the coast, after we had been living for a year on nothing but dainties.\"  \"He has all the admirable characteristics of a child!\"  interrupted Euergetes.  \"And if that is all that appears estimable to you in the Roman your son may soon replace the great Cornelius.\"  \"Not soon! no, not till he shall have grown older than you are, and a man, a thorough man, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, for such a man is Publius!  I believe--nay, I am sure--that he is incapable of any mean action, that he could not be false in word or even in look, nor feign a sentiment be did not feel.\"  \"Why so vehement, sister?  So much zeal is quite unnecessary on this occasion!  You know well enough that I have my easy days, and that this excitement is not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5464"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 4 (#6)"],["body"," for you; nor has the Roman deserved that you should be quite beside yourself for his sake.  The fellow dared in my presence to look at you as Paris might at Helen before he carried her off, and to drink out of your cup; and this morning he no doubt did not contradict what he conveyed to you last night with his eyes--nay, perhaps by his words.  And yet, scarcely an hour before, he had been to the Necropolis to bear his sweetheart away from the temple of the gloomy Serapis into that of the smiling Eros.\"  \"You shall prove this!\" cried the queen in great excitement.  \"Publius is my friend--\"  \"And I am yours!\"  \"You have often proved the reverse, and now again with lies and cheating--\"  \"You seem,\" interrupted Euergetes, \"to have learned from your unphilosophical favorite to express your indignation with extraordinary frankness; to-day however I am, as I have said, as gentle as a kitten--\"  \"Euergetes and gentleness!\" cried Cleopatra with a forced laugh.  \"No, you only step softly like a cat when she is watching a bird, and your gentleness covers some ruthless scheme, which we shall find out soon enough to our cost.  You have been talking with Eulaeus to-day; Eulaeus, who fears and hates Publius, and it seems to me that you have hatched some conspiracy against him; but if you dare to cast a single stone in his path, to touch a single hair of his head, I will show you that even a weak woman can be terrible.  Nemesis and the Erinnyes from Alecto to Megaera, the most terrible of all the gods, are women!\"  Cleopatra had hissed rather than spoken these words, with her teeth set with rage, and had raised her small fist to threaten her brother; but Euergetes preserved a perfect composure till she had ceased speaking. Then he took a step closer to her, crossed his arms over his breast, and asked her in the deepest bass of his fine deep voice:  \"Are you idiotically in love with this Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, or do you purpose to make use of him and his kith and kin in Rome against me?\"  Transported with rage, and without blenching in the least at her brother's piercing gaze, she hastily retorted: \"Up to this moment only the first perhaps--for what is my husband to me?  But if you go on as you have begun I shall begin to consider how I may make use of his influence and of his liking for me, on the shores of the Tiber.\"  \"Liking!\"  cried Euergetes, and he laughed so loud and violently that Zoe, who was listening at the tent door, gave a little scream, and Cleopatra drew back a step.  \"And to think that you--the most prudent of the prudent--who can hear the dew fall and the grass grow, and smell here in Memphis the smoke of every fire that is lighted in Alexandria or in Syria or even in Rome--that you, my mother's daughter, should be caught over head and ears by a broad-shouldered lout, for all the world like a clumsy town-girl or a wench at a loom.  This ignorant Adonis, who knows so well how to make use of his own strange and resolute personality, and of the power that stands in his background, thinks no more of the hearts he sets in flames than I of the earthen jar out of which water is drawn when I am thirsty.  You think to make use of him by the 'Tiber; but he has anticipated you, and learns from you all that is going on by the Nile and everything they most want to know in the Senate.  \"You do not believe me, for no one ever is ready to believe anything that can diminish his self-esteem--and why should you believe me?  I frankly confess that I do not hesitate to lie when I hope to gain more by untruth than by that much-belauded and divine truth, which, according to your favorite Plato, is allied to all earthly beauty; but it is often just as useless as beauty itself, for the useful and the beautiful exclude each other in a thousand cases, for ten when they coincide.  There, the gong is sounding for the third time.  If you care for plain proof that the Roman, only an hour before he visited you this morning, had our little Hebe carried off from the temple, and conveyed to the house of Apollodorus, the sculptor, at Memphis, you have only to come to see me in my rooms early to-morrow after the first morning sacrifice.  You will at any rate wish to come and congratulate me; bring your children with you, as I propose making them presents.  You might even question the Roman himself at the banquet to-day, but he will hardly appear, for the sweetest gifts of Eros are bestowed at night, and as the temple of Serapis is closed at sunset Publius has never yet seen his Irene in the evening.  May I expect you and the children after morning sacrifice?\"  Before Cleopatra had time to answer this question another trumpet-blast was heard, and she exclaimed: \"That is Philometor, come to fetch us to the banquet.  I will ere long give the Roman the opportunity of defending himself, though--in spite of your accusations--I trust him entirely. This morning I asked him solemnly whether it was true that he was in love with his friend's charming Hebe, and he denied it in his firm and manly way, and his replies were admirable and worthy of the noblest mind, when I ventured to doubt his sincerity.  He takes truth more seriously than you do.  He regards it not only as beautiful and right to be truthful, he says, but as prudent too; for lies can only procure us a small short- lived advantage, as transitory as the mists of night which vanish as soon as the sun appears, while truth is like the sunlight itself, which as often as it is dimmed by clouds reappears again and again.  And, he says, what makes a liar so particularly contemptible in his eyes is, that to attain his end, he must be constantly declaring and repeating the horror he has of those who are and do the very same thing as he himself.  The ruler of a state cannot always be truthful, and I often have failed in truth; but my intercourse with Publius has aroused much that is good in me, and which had been slumbering with closed eyes; and if this man should prove to be the same as all the rest of you, then I will follow your road, Euergetes, and laugh at virtue and truth, and set the busts of Aristippus and Strato on the pedestals where those of Zeno and Antisthenes now stand.\"  \"You mean to have the busts of the philosophers moved again?\"  asked King Philometor, who, as he entered the tent, had heard the queen's last words.  \"And Aristippus is to have the place of honor?  I have no objection--though he teaches that man must subjugate matter and not become subject to it.--[\"Mihi res, non me rebus subjungere.\"]--This indeed is easier to say than to do, and there is no man to whom it is more impossible than to a king who has to keep on good terms with Greeks and Egyptians, as we have, and with Rome as well.  And besides all this to avoid quarrelling with a jealous brother, who shares our kingdom!  If men could only know how much they would have to do as kings only in reading and writing, they would take care never to struggle for a crown! Up to this last half hour I have been examining and deciding applications and petitions.  Have you got through yours, Euergetes?  Even more had accumulated for you than for us.\"  \"All were settled in an hour,\" replied the other promptly.  \"My eye is quicker than the mouth of your reader, and my decisions commonly consist of three words while you dictate long treatises to your scribes.  So I had done when you had scarcely begun, and yet I could tell you at once, if it were not too tedious a matter, every single case that has come before me for months, and explain it in all its details.\"  \"That I could not indeed,\" said Philometor modestly, \"but I know and admire your swift intelligence and accurate memory.\"  \"You see I am more fit for a king than you are;\" laughed Euergetes.  \"You are too gentle and debonair for a throne!  Hand over your government to me.  I will fill your treasury every year with gold.  I beg you now, come to Alexandria with Cleopatra for good, and share with me the palace and the gardens in the Bruchion.  I will nominate your little Philopator heir to the throne, for I have no wish to contract a permanent tie with any woman, as Cleopatra belongs to you.  This is a bold proposal, but reflect, Philometor, if you were to accept it, how much time it would give you for your music, your disputations with the Jews, and all your other favorite occupations.\"  \"You never know how far you may go with your jest!\"  interrupted Cleopatra.  \"Besides, you devote quite as much time to your studies in philology and natural history as he does to music and improving conversations with his learned friends.\"  \"Just so,\" assented Philometor, \"and you may be counted among the sages of the Museum with far more reason than I.\"  \"But the difference between us,\" replied Euergetes, \"is that I despise all the philosophical prattlers and rubbish-collectors in Alexandria almost to the point of hating them, while for science I have as great a passion as for a lover.  You, on the contrary, make much of the learned men, but trouble yourself precious little about science.\"  \"Drop the subject, pray,\" begged Cleopatra.  \"I believe that you two have never yet been together for half an hour without Euergetes having begun some dispute, and Philometor having at last given in, to pacify him.  Our guests must have been waiting for us a long time.  Had Publius Scipio made his appearance?\"  \"He had sent to excuse himself,\" replied the king as he scratched the poll of Cleopatra's parrot, parting its feathers with the tips of his fingers.  \"Lysias, the Corinthian, is sitting below, and he says he does not know where his friend can be gone.\"  \"But we know very well,\" said Euergetes, casting an ironical glance at the queen.  \"It is pleasant to be with Philometor and Cleopatra, but better still with Eros and Hebe.  Sister, you look pale--shall I call for Zoe?\"  Cleopatra shook her head in negation, but she dropped into a seat, and sat stooping, with her head bowed over her knees as if"]]]
