It was winter, and yet the mid-day sun sent down glowing rays, which were reflected from the naked rocks.  In front of the caravan marched a company of Libyan soldiers, and another brought up the rear.  Each man was armed with a dagger and battle-axe, a shield and a lance, and was ready to use his weapons; for those whom they were escorting were prisoners from the emerald-mines, who had been convoyed to the shores of the Red Sea to carry thither the produce of the mines, and had received, as a return-load, provisions which had arrived from Egypt, and which were to be carried to the storehouses of the mountain mines.  Bent and panting, they made their way along.  Each prisoner had a copper chain riveted round his ankles, and torn rags hanging round their loins, were the only clothing of these unhappy beings, who, gasping under the weight of the sacks they had to carry, kept their staring eyes fixed on the ground.  If one of them threatened to sink altogether under his burden, he was refreshed by the whip of one of the horsemen, who accompanied the caravan.  Many a one found it hard to choose whether he could best endure the suffering of mere endurance, or the torture of the lash.  No one spoke a word, neither the prisoners nor their guards; and even those who were flogged did not cry out, for their powers were exhausted, and in the souls of their drivers there was no more impulse of pity than there was a green herb on the rocks by the way.  This melancholy procession moved silently onwards, like a procession of phantoms, and the ear was only made aware of it when now and then a low groan broke from one of the victims.  The sandy path, trodden by their naked feet, gave no sound, the mountains seemed to withhold their shade, the light of clay was a torment--every thing far and near seemed inimical to the living.  Not a plant, not a creeping thing, showed itself against the weird forms of the barren grey and brown rocks, and no soaring bird tempted the oppressed wretches to raise their eyes to heaven.  In the noontide heat of the previous day they had started with their loads from the harbor-creek.  For two hours they had followed the shore of the glistening, blue-green sea,       [The Red Sea--in Hebrew and Coptic the reedy sea--is of a lovely      blue green color.  According to the Ancients it was named red either      from its red banks or from the Erythraeans, who were called the red      people.  On an early inscription it is called \"the water of the Red      country.\"  See \"Durch Gosen zum Sinai.\"]  then they had climbed a rocky shoulder and crossed a small plateau.  They had paused for their night's rest in the gorge which led to the mines; the guides and soldiers lighted fires, grouped themselves round them, and lay down to sleep under the shelter of a cleft in the rocks; the prisoners stretched themselves on the earth in the middle of the valley without any shelter, and shivering with the cold which suddenly succeeded the glowing heat of the day.  The benumbed wretches now looked forward to the crushing misery of the morning's labor as eagerly as, a few hours since, they had longed for the night, and for rest.  Lentil-broth and hard bread in abundance, but a very small quantity of water was given to them before they started; then they set out through the gorge, which grew hotter and hotter, and through ravines where they could pass only one by one.  Every now and then it seemed as if the path came to an end, but each time it found an outlet, and went on--as endless as the torment of the wayfarers.  Mighty walls of rock composed the view, looking as if they were formed of angular masses of hewn stone piled up in rows; and of all the miners one, and one only, had eyes for these curious structures of the evervarious hand of Nature.  This one had broader shoulders than his companions, and his burden Weighed on him comparatively lightly.  \"In this solitude,\" thought he, \"which repels man, and forbids his passing his life here, the Chnemu, the laborers who form the world, have spared themselves the trouble of filling up the seams, and rounding off the corners.  How is it that Man should have dedicated this hideous land--in which even the human heart seems to be hardened against all pity--to the merciful Hathor?  Perhaps because it so sorely stands in need of the joy and peace which the loving goddess alone can bestow.\"  \"Keep the line, Huni!\"  shouted a driver.  The man thus addressed, closed up to the next man, the panting leech Nebsecht.  We know the other stronger prisoner.  It is Pentaur, who had been entered as Huni on the lists of mine-laborers, and was called by that name.  The file moved on; at every step the ascent grew more rugged. Red and black fragments of stone, broken as small as if by the hand of man, lay in great heaps, or strewed the path which led up the almost perpendicular cliff by imperceptible degrees.  Here another gorge opened before them, and this time there seemed to be no outlet.  \"Load the asses less!\" cried the captain of the escort to the prisoners. Then he turned to the soldiers, and ordered them, when the beasts were eased, to put the extra burthens on the inen.  Putting forth their utmost strength, the overloaded men labored up the steep and hardly distinguishable mountain path.  The man in front of Pentaur, a lean old man, when half way up the hill- side, fell in a heap under his load, and a driver, who in a narrow defile could not reach the bearers, threw a stone at him to urge him to a renewed effort.  The old man cried out at the blow, and at the cry--the paraschites stricken down with stones--his own struggle with the mob--and the appearance of Bent Anat flashed into Pentaur's lnernory.  Pity and a sense of his own healthy vigor prompted him to energy; he hastily snatched the sack from the shoulders of the old man, threw it over his own, helped up the fallen wretch, and finally men and beasts succeeded in mounting the rocky wall.  The pulses throbbed in Pentaur's temples, and he shuddered with horror, as he looked down from the height of the pass into the abyss below, and round upon the countless pinnacles and peaks, cliffs and precipices, in many-colored rocks-white and grey, sulphurous yellow, blood-red and ominous black.  He recalled the sacred lake of Muth in Thebes, round which sat a hundred statues of the lion-headed Goddess in black basalt, each on a pedestal; and the rocky peaks, which surrounded the valley at his feet, seemed to put on a semblance of life and to move and open their yawning jaws; through the wild rush of blood in his ears he fancied he heard them roar, and the load beyond his strength which he carried gave him a sensation as though their clutch was on his breast.  Nevertheless he reached the goal.  The other prisoners flung their loads from their shoulders, and threw themselves down to rest.  Mechanically he did the same: his pulses beat more calmly, by degrees the visions faded from his senses, he saw and heard once more, and his brain recovered its balance.  The old man and Nebsecht were lying beside him.  His grey-haired companion rubbed the swollen veins in his neck, and called down all the blessings of the Gods upon his head; but the captain of the caravan cut him short, exclaiming:  \"You have strength for three, Huni; farther on, we will load you more heavily.\"  \"How much the kindly Gods care for our prayers for the blessing of others!\"  exclaimed Nebsecht.  \"How well they know how to reward a good action!\"  \"I am rewarded enough,\" said Pentaur, looking kindly at the old man. \"But you, you everlasting scoffer--you look pale.  How do you feel?\"  \"As if I were one of those donkeys there,\" replied the naturalist.  \"My knees shake like theirs, and I think and I wish neither more nor less than they do; that is to say--I would we were in our stalls.\"  \"If you can think,\" said Pentaur smiling, \"you are not so very bad.\"  \"I had a good thought just now, when you were staring up into the sky. The intellect, say the priestly sages, is a vivifying breath of the eternal spirit, and our soul is the mould or core for the mass of matter which we call a human being.  I sought the spirit at first in the heart, then in the brain; but now I know that it resides in the arms and legs, for when I have strained them I find thought is impossible.  I am too tired to enter on further evidence, but for the future I shall treat my legs with the utmost consideration.\"  \"Quarrelling again you two?  On again, men!\"  cried the driver.  The weary wretches rose slowly, the beasts were loaded, and on went the pitiable procession, so as to reach the mines before sunset.  The destination of the travellers was a wide valley, closed in by two high and rocky mountain-slopes; it was called Ta Mafka by the Egyptians, Dophka by the Hebrews.  The southern cliff-wall consisted of dark granite, the northern of red sandstone; in a distant branch of the valley lay the mines in which copper was found.  In the midst of the valley rose a hill, surrounded by a wall, and crowned with small stone houses, for the guard, the officers, and the overseers.  According to the old regulations, they were without roofs, but as many deaths and much sickness had occurred among the workmen in consequence of the cold nights, they had been slightly sheltered with palm-branches brought from the oasis of the Alnalckites, at no great distance.  On the uttermost peak of the hill, where it was most exposed to the wind, were the smelting furnaces, and a manufactory where a peculiar green glass was prepared, which was brought into the market under the name of Mafkat, that is to say, emerald.  The genuine precious stone was found farther to the south, on the western shore of the Red Sea, and was highly prized in Egypt.  Our friends had already for more than a month belonged to the mining- community of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5446"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 08 (#4)"],["body","valley, and Pentaur had never learned how it was that he had been brought hither with his companion Nebsecht, instead of going to the sandstone quarries of Chennu.  That Uarda's father had effected this change was beyond a doubt, and the poet trusted the rough but honest soldier who still kept near him, and gave him credit for the best intentions, although he had only spoken to him once since their departure from Thebes.  That was the first night, when he had come up to Pentaur, and whispered: \"I am looking after you.  You will find the physician Nebsecht here; but treat each other as enemies rather than as friends, if you do not wish to be parted.\"  Pentaur had communicated the soldier's advice to Nebsecht, and he had followed it in his own way.  It afforded him a secret pleasure to see how Pentaur's life contradicted the belief in a just and beneficent ordering of the destinies of men; and the more he and the poet were oppressed, the more bitter was the irony, often amounting to extravagance, with which the mocking sceptic attacked him.  He loved Pentaur, for the poet had in his keeping the key which alone could give admission to the beautiful world which lay locked up in his own soul; but yet it was easy to him, if he thought they were observed, to play his part, and to overwhelm Pentaur with words which, to the drivers, were devoid of meaning, and which made them laugh by the strange blundering fashion in which he stammered them out.  \"A belabored husk of the divine self-consciousness.\"  \"An advocate of righteousness hit on the mouth.\"  \"A juggler who makes as much of this worst of all possible worlds as if it were the best.\"  \"An admirer of the lovely color of his blue bruises.\"  These and other terms of invective, intelligible only to himself and his butt, he could always pour out in new combinations, exciting Pentaur to sharp and often witty rejoinders, equally unintelligible to the uninitiated.  Frequently their sparring took the form of a serious discussion, which served a double purpose; first their minds, accustomed to serious thought, found exercise in spite of the murderous pressure of the burden of forced labor, and secondly, they were supposed really to be enemies. They slept in the same court-yard, and contrived, now and then, to exchange a few words in secret; but by day Nebsecht worked in the turquoise-diggings, and Pentaur in the mines, for the careful chipping out of the precious stones from their stony matrix was the work best suited to the slight physician, while Pentaur's giant-strength was fitted for hewing the ore out of the hard rock.  The drivers often looked in surprise at his powerful strokes, as he flung his pick against the stone.  The stupendous images that in such moments of wild energy rose before the poet's soul, the fearful or enchanting tones that rang in his spirit's ear-none could guess at.  Usually his excited fancy showed him the form of Bent-Anat, surrounded by a host of men--and these he seemed to fell to the earth, one-by-one, as-he hewed the rock.  Often in the middle of his work he would stop, throw down his pick-axe, and spread out his arms--but only to drop them with a deep groan, and wipe the sweat from his brow.  The overseers did not know what to think of this powerful youth, who often was as gentle as a child, and then seemed possessed of that demon to which so many of the convicts fell victims.  He had indeed become a riddle to himself; for how was it that he--the gardener's son, brought up in the peaceful temple of Seti--ever since that night by the house of the paraschites had had such a perpetual craving for conflict and struggle?  The weary gangs were gone to rest; a bright fire still blazed in front of the house of the superintendent of the mines, and round it squatted in a circle the overseers and the subalterns of the troops.  \"Put the wine-jar round again,\" said the captain, \"for we must hold grave council.  Yesterday I had orders from the Regent to send half the guard to Pelusium.  He requires soldiers, but we are so few in number that if the convicts knew it they might make short work of us, even without arms. There are stones enough hereabouts, and by day they have their hammer and chisel.  Things are worst among the Hebrews in the copper-mines; they are a refractory crew that must be held tight.  You know me well, fear is unknown to me--but I feel great anxiety.  The last fuel is now burning in this fire, and the smelting furnaces and the glass-foundry must not stand idle.  Tomorrow we must send men to Raphidim       [The oasis at the foot of Horeb, where the Jews under Joshua's      command conquered the Amalekites, while Aaron and Hur held up Moses'      arms.  Exodus 17, 8.]  to obtain charcoal from the Amalekites.  They owe us a hundred loads still.  Load the prisoners with some copper, to make them tired and the natives civil.  What can we do to procure what we want, and yet not to weaken the forces here too much?\"  Various opinions were given, and at last it was settled that a small division, guarded by a few soldiers, should be sent out every day to supply only the daily need for charcoal.  It was suggested that the most dangerous of the convicts should be fettered together in pairs to perform their duties.  The superintendent was of opinion that two strong men fettered together would be more to be feared if only they acted in concert.  \"Then chain a strong one to a weak one,\" said the chief accountant of the mines, whom the Egyptians called the 'scribe of the metals.'  \"And fetter those together who are enemies.\"  \"The colossal Huni, for instance, to that puny spat row, the stuttering Nebsecht,\" said a subaltern.  \"I was thinking of that very couple,\" said the accountant laughing.  Three other couples were selected, at first with some laughter, but finally with serious consideration, and Uarda's father was sent with the drivers as an escort.  On the following morning Pentaur and Nebsecht were fettered together with a copper chain, and when the sun was at its height four pairs of prisoners, heavily loaded with copper, set out for the Oasis of the Amalekites, accompanied by six soldiers and the son of the paraschites, to fetch fuel for the smelting furnaces.  They rested near the town of Alus, and then went forward again between bare walls of greyish-green and red porphyry.  These cliffs rose higher and higher, but from time to time, above the lower range, they could see the rugged summit of some giant of the range, though, bowed under their heavy loads, they paid small heed to it.  The sun was near setting when they reached the little sanctuary of the 'Emerald-Hathor.'  A few grey and black birds here flew towards them, and Pentaur gazed at them with delight.  How long be had missed the sight of a bird, and the sound of their chirp and song!  Nebsecht said: \"There are some birds--we must be near water.\"  And there stood the first palm-tree!  Now the murmur of the brook was perceptible, and its tiny sound touched the thirsty souls of the travellers as rain falls on dry grass.  On the left bank of the stream an encampment of Egyptian soldiers formed a large semicircle, enclosing three large tents made of costly material striped with blue and white, and woven with gold thread.  Nothing was to be seen of the inhabitants of these tents, but when the prisoners had passed them, and the drivers were exchanging greetings with the out- posts, a girl, in the long robe of an Egyptian, came towards them, and looked at them.  Pentaur started as if he had seen a ghost; but Nebsecht gave expression to his astonishment in a loud cry.  At the same instant a driver laid his whip across their shoulders, and cried laughing:  \"You may hit each other as hard as you like with words, but not with your hands.\"  Then be turned to his companions, and said: \"Did you see the pretty girl there, in front of the tent?\"  \"It is nothing to us!\"  answered the man he addressed.  \"She belongs to the princess's train.  She has been three weeks here on a visit to the holy shrine of Hathor.\"  \"She must have committed some heavy sin,\" replied the other.  \"If she were one of us, she would have been set to sift sand in the diggings, or grind colors, and not be living here in a gilt tent.  Where is our red- beard?\"  Uarda's father had lingered a little behind the party, for the girl had signed to him, and exchanged a few words with him.  \"Have you still an eye for the fair ones?\"  asked the youngest of the drivers when be rejoined the gang.  \"She is a waiting maid of the princess,\" replied the soldier not without embarrassment.  \"To-morrow morning we are to carry a letter from her to the scribe of the mines, and if we encamp in the neighborhood she will send us some wine for carrying it.\"  \"The old red-beard scents wine as a fox scents a goose.  Let us encamp here; one never knows what may be picked up among the Mentu, and the superintendent said we were to encamp outside the oasis.  Put down your sacks, men!  Here there is fresh water, and perhaps a few dates and sweet Manna for you to eat with it.       [\"Man\" is the name still given by the Bedouins of Sinai to the sweet      gum which exudes from the Tamarix mannifera.  It is the result of      the puncture of an insect, and occurs chiefly in May.  By many it is      supposed to be the Manna of the Bible.]  But keep the peace, you two quarrelsome fellows--Huni and Nebsecht.\"  Bent-Anat's journey to the Emerald-Hathor was long since ended.  As far as Keft she had sailed down the Nile with her escort, from thence she had crossed the desert by easy marches, and she had been obliged to wait a full week in the port on the Red Sea, which was chiefly inhabited by Phoenicians, for a ship which had finally brought her to the little seaport of Pharan.  From Pharan she had crossed the mountains to the oasis, where the sanctuary she was to visit stood on the northern side.  The old priests, who conducted the service of the Goddess, had "]]]
