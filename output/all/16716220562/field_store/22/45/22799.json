Christmas will soon be here now, you know.”  “In little more than three weeks. Yes, Isabel, I know what you are thinking of. We agreed to open our banks to-day, and see how much we have saved to spend for Christmas gifts.”  “Yes, that is it,” replied Isabel, joyfully. “I am so glad that we can open them at last. I want to know how much we have saved. Shall I bring them now?”  “If you please. I have just finished learning my geography lesson.”  Isabel ran to the closet, and quickly returned with two money-boxes, or banks, in her hand. She gave one to her sister, and taking the other herself, they both succeeded, without much difficulty, in making an opening so that they could get at the treasure within. For nearly a year the little girls had saved almost every penny which had been given them, that they might have the pleasure of giving as well as receiving the pretty holiday gifts.  “Well, Mary, how much have you?” asked Isabel, as she finished counting the pile of pennies, sixpences, and shillings which lay before her.  “Four dollars and a few pennies,” answered Mary. “I did not think I had so much.”  “And I have a little more than _five_ dollars,” said Isabel, triumphantly. “You know I saved the gold dollar which grandfather gave me, and you did not. Are you not sorry that you spent it?”  “Not at all, Isabel. That dollar has done more good in the last two months than it would have done lying in our little banks. You know I bought a nice pair of shoes and some stockings for Susan Green, that she might attend the sabbath school. Her teacher says she is learning very fast, and is one of the best children in her class.”  “Well, never mind that now, Mary. Let us talk about the best way to spend our money. What will you buy for father and mother? I am going to work a pair of slippers for father, and I shall buy a pretty worked collar for mother. I heard her say the other day that she needed some new collars.”  “Have you time to embroider a pair of slippers?” asked Mary.  “Oh yes! Ellen Shaw taught me a new way. I shall buy the slippers ready made, and then embroider them with gold thread. They will cost me about a dollar, and mother’s collar will be nearly two. Then I must buy a present for Betsey; a new apron will please her, I think, and will not cost too much. I have a nice plan for spending the remainder of the money; but first let me hear what you are going to do with yours.”  “I shall buy a handsome inkstand for father’s desk. You know he broke his large one the other day, and is using an old one of mother’s now. I will try to get one just like that which he broke. For mother I will buy a beautiful rose-bush to put upon her flower-stand. For Betsey I shall have a nice warm hood. I am to buy the materials, and mother has promised to help me make it. There will still be as much as a dollar and a half remaining, and mother says that if this is expended prudently it will do a great deal of good. I have not quite decided what to do with it, but I think I shall make a nice warm coverlet for that poor old man and his wife whom we went to see last week. I heard the old woman telling mother that she often suffered dreadfully with rheumatism during the winter; and when I looked around and saw what a miserable shanty they have to shelter them, I could hardly keep from weeping.”  “But I dare say that some one else will give them a coverlet,” replied Isabel, with a look of disappointment, “and I want you to put your money with mine, and buy a pretty present for our teacher. We can get a very pretty work-box for three dollars, and I am sure she would be very much pleased.”  Mary was silent for a few minutes. She loved her teacher very much, and thought it would be very pleasant to make her a present; but then the remembrance of the poor old couple in the wretched shanty came strongly to her mind, and she said, decidedly, “No, Isabel, I cannot do it. I should be very glad to make Miss Spencer a present, and perhaps mother will show me how to make a needle-book for her, but the poor people need a coverlet more than she needs a work-box.”  “That is no rule, Mary. We cannot always give to those who need it the most. All of the girls are going to call at Miss Spencer’s house on Christmas morning, and each one will take her a little gift. If you will only join with me, our present will be prettier and more valuable than any other she will receive.”  “I do not care about that, Isabel. Miss Spencer will not value the gifts for the sake of what they cost. She will be pleased to find that we think of her and love her. But I am sure she would rather I would spend my money in doing good. You know we both agreed to save a part for the poor.”  “I know we did, but some other time will do as well as Christmas,” replied Isabel. “If you will not help me to buy the work-box, I will buy it myself, and not spend so much on my other presents. I saw a beauty for three dollars, the other day, and I am determined to have one like it.”  “Father says that we ought to try to do all the good we can upon Christmas day,” answered Mary, gently. “You know it is the anniversary of the day when the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world, that He might do more good to men; and if we love to do as He teaches us, we shall be willing to give up our own pleasure for the sake of helping others.”  Isabel felt that she was in the wrong, but she was not willing to acknowledge it, and therefore replied rather crossly that Mary could do as she pleased, but she had no idea of spending her money in Christmas gifts for the poor.  The girls therefore said no more to each other upon the subject. They were both very busy in their preparations for Christmas, however, and long before the important day arrived everything was in readiness. The work-box for her teacher had taken so large a portion of Isabel’s money, that her gifts for her other friends were necessarily trifling, but she did not regret this when she thought how pleased Miss Spencer would be with so valuable a present, and how astonished her young companions would appear at her generosity.  Mary had, with the advice of her mother, expended the part of her money which she had set apart for the poor, so judiciously, that it went much farther than she had anticipated. Some partly worn dresses served for the outside of the coverlet, and with the money thus saved, many other comfortable things were procured. The happy little girl danced for joy when all was completed, and she thought how much good even her small hands could do.  The day before Christmas arrived; and a merry group of girls had assembled at an early hour in Miss Spencer’s pleasant school-room, to talk over their plans for the holidays.  “And now, girls, let us arrange at what hour we will call on Miss Spencer, to wish her a merry Christmas, and present our little gifts,” exclaimed Caroline Elwyn, one of the oldest of the scholars. “I propose that we should all meet at the great oak tree, at ten o’clock to-morrow morning, and then we can go together. Only you must be sure to be punctual, for the weather is rather too cold to make it very agreeable to wait for each other.”  All of the girls readily agreed to this plan, and then followed an animated discussion as to the beauty and value of their separate gifts. One had prepared a work-bag, another a needle-book, a third had worked a collar, a fourth a pin-cushion.  “And now, tell us what your present is to be, Isabel,” said Caroline Elwyn. “You are so wonderfully silent about it, that we suspect it must be something far surpassing our humble offerings. You shake your head. Well, we will not urge you. Cannot you enlighten us, Mary?”  “I can only tell you what my own gift is to be,” was the smiling reply, “I have made a pen-wiper to lie upon her desk.”  “We shall soon discover Isabel’s secret,” exclaimed another of the girls. “Only a few hours, now, before the happy time will be here. I wish it were night. Time passes so quickly when we are sleeping.”  The merry laugh which this remark occasioned had hardly subsided, when their teacher entered the room. She greeted them with her usual affectionate good morning, and pleasantly remarked that they must study with unusual diligence that day, as the holidays were so near.  The girls cheerfully took their books, and, in spite of their joyful anticipations for the coming weeks, their lessons were well learned and recited.  Toward the close of the afternoon session, Miss Spencer requested them to put away their books, as she had something to say to them before she closed the school.  When everything was arranged in an orderly manner, she told them that it had been her custom for several years to visit the poor families in the neighborhood on Christmas day, and endeavor to do what she could for their comfort. She said that she hoped that all of her scholars had thought of the poor in preparing their Christmas gifts, and had remembered that though it was very pleasant and proper to present tokens of affection to their friends, yet it was better still to relieve those who were in need.  Mary looked at her teacher while she was speaking, with such a bright, animated expression, that Miss Spencer could not help remarking it, and said, kindly,  “Have you thought of this in your preparations for Christmas, Mary?”  “I have tried to do what I could, ma’am,” was the modest reply.  “I had thought of proposing that some of my scholars should accompany me in my visits to the poor to-morrow,” continued Miss Spencer. “There is one old couple in particular whom I am very anxious to assist, as they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54803"],["title","Playing Santa Claus, and Other Christmas Tales (#6)"],["body"," exceedingly destitute. They live in that miserable shanty at the foot of the hill. How many of you are willing to aid me in this good work, provided your parents consent?”  Almost every hand was raised, and then each spoke in turn. One had saved a dollar for the use of the poor, and would give any part of it which her teacher thought best. Another had a half dollar, another a quarter, and three pretty little girls said they each had a bright dime, which mother had given them to spend for the poor. Mary had no money, but she told of the warm coverlet and some comfortable flannels which she had prepared for the very couple whom her teacher wished to assist.  “We shall make their home a happy one to-morrow,” said Miss Spencer. “I have two dollars of my own to give them, and I have also prepared a basket of food suitable for their Christmas dinner. But I think you have not yet spoken, Isabel. Have you nothing to give? I believe you told me that you had saved five dollars for Christmas gifts. A part of this would be well disposed in relieving these poor sufferers.”  Isabel blushed deeply, as she said, in a low tone, that she had already spent her money.  It was then arranged that the girls should meet at their teacher’s house the next morning, bringing with them whatever their parents were willing that they should bestow in charity. Miss Spencer did not know that they had already agreed to meet there to present the gifts which they had prepared for herself, and the girls were quite pleased to think how surprised she would be when she discovered this little secret.  Among all the merry group which left the school-house, Isabel alone was sad and uncomfortable.  “I do not know why I should feel so badly,” she said to herself. “I have done nothing wrong. I have not been selfish, for I have spent every penny of my money in preparing gifts for others.”  But Isabel had not yet learned to examine her motives strictly. She did not reflect that the greater part of her money had been expended for gifts which it would gratify her vanity and pride to present. The box which she had purchased for her teacher was bought for the very purpose of outshining her companions. She did not love Miss Spencer any better than the other scholars, but she wished to make a display of generosity and affection which would astonish them all.  Miss Spencer had frequently noticed this defect in Isabel’s character, and when she found that none of the money which she had boasted of having saved was reserved for charitable purposes, she felt grieved, and calling Isabel to her as the other scholars left the room, she passed her arm around her, and said, gently, “I am sorry that you cannot aid us in our good work, Isabel.”  “I am sorry, too, Miss Spencer, but I have spent all my money in preparing gifts for my friends.”  “We should never forget the poor, Isabel. Would not less valuable gifts have expressed equal affection for those you love, and then there would have been some remaining for those who need it more.”  Isabel made no reply, but she looked sad and mortified as she bade her teacher good afternoon. And yet her pride was not subdued; for when Mary kindly offered to share with her the articles which she had prepared for the poor, she answered, haughtily, that she could easily have bought these things if she had chosen to do so.  Christmas morning was bright and beautiful, and very mild for the season. With happy hearts and faces the little girls met around the old oak tree, and after telling each other of the pretty gifts they had received, and displaying those which they had brought for their teacher, they all proceeded to Miss Spencer’s house.  Now was the time for Isabel’s expected triumph. With glowing cheeks and a self-satisfied air she presented her present; but the murmur of admiration which she had anticipated was not heard.  Miss Spencer thanked her, and said it was a very pretty box; but she seemed quite as well pleased with some of the most trifling articles which were given her. She particularly commended the neatness and good taste which Mary had shown in making the pen-wiper. Indeed, she seemed more delighted with even the most simple gifts which the scholars had made themselves, than with far more costly ones which had been purchased for her.  As for the scholars, they were so much occupied with examining what they had brought for the poor, that they could give but a passing glance of admiration at the work-box.  As Isabel had nothing to give she did not wish to accompany the happy party, and therefore returned immediately home. Her mother found her in her own room weeping bitterly, and gently drew from her the cause of her grief.  “This may be a useful lesson to you, dear Isabel,” she said. “It will teach you that no real happiness is ever derived from a selfish act. Your motive in presenting a more expensive gift to your teacher than the rest of your companions were prepared to do, was selfish. You expected to receive praise and admiration. In this you were disappointed, and therefore you are unhappy. Another time I trust you will do better. In expending your money for Christmas gifts, you will remember those who need it most, and will gladly give, hoping for nothing again.”  Isabel still wept, but less violently than before, and when Mary entered with a beaming countenance, and told her mother of the gratitude and joy of the poor people whom they had visited, Isabel put her arm around her neck and asked her forgiveness for her ill humor, and promised that when another Christmas came, she too would remember _those who need it most_.                                APRIL FOOL’S DAY.   “What new experiment are you trying, my son?” asked Mr. Willard, as he entered his pleasant parlor late in the afternoon of a day in early spring, unperceived by his little son Arthur, who was busily employed in tying up several small packages which lay on the table before him.  Arthur looked up at his father with a bright smile; for Mr. Willard always took a great interest in the amusements of his children, and they were in the habit of consulting him and asking his assistance in many of their sports.  “Don’t tell Willie and Jane, father,” said Arthur, “and I will tell you all about it. You know to-morrow will be the first day of April, and I expect to have a fine time playing tricks upon people. There is nothing in these parcels but little chips and stones. I shall put one of them upon Jane’s table after she is asleep to-night; and she will be sure to open it the first thing in the morning. I expect she will think that Uncle Samuel or Aunt Mary were here in the evening, and brought her a nice little present. Then I shall drop another package where Willie will find it when he goes to feed his chickens. What a hurry he will be in to pick it up!  “And, father,” continued Arthur, “you do not know what a nice joke I shall play upon Susan! Sometimes, when I get up early in the morning, and she is in a hurry getting breakfast, I go to Mr. Conant’s for the milk. Now, to-morrow morning I mean to be up very early, before Susan leaves her room. Then I will take the milk-pail, and put a quart of water into it, and set it in the place where I usually put it when I bring the milk. When Susan comes into the kitchen, she will see the pail on the table, and, finding it heavy, will suppose I have been for the milk. So she will say, ‘O, Arthur! you are a good boy to bring my milk;’ and then she will take off the cover to pour it into the pitcher. How I shall laugh at her when she finds it is water!”  Mr. Willard smiled a little as Arthur clapped his hands at the thought of Susan’s vexation: but in a moment he looked grave, and, seating himself in his rocking-chair, he drew his little son close to his side, and said, kindly,—  “Do the angels try to make people happy or unhappy, Arthur?”  “Happy, father,” replied the boy, looking wonderingly in his father’s face.  “Then you are not trying to do like the angels,—are you, Arthur. You mean to vex people, and make them unhappy.”  Arthur blushed, and looked very thoughtful; and his father continued,—  “Jane and Willie and Susan will all feel somewhat vexed and displeased at your jokes,—will they not, my son?”  “Yes, sir, I suppose they will,” answered Arthur; “but, then, I want to have a little fun on April Fool’s Day.”  “It is poor fun to make others unhappy. I have no objection to your playing jokes or tricks, as you call them, upon your brother and sister and Susan; but I should like to have you think of something which would please them, instead of making them vexed.”  “But, father, I cannot think of any tricks of that kind.”  “I will help you a little, Arthur, and then you will understand what I mean. We will take the trick which you intended to play upon Susan, for instance. Now, if, instead of putting water in the pail, and deceiving her by making her think it is milk, you should rise early, and really bring her the milk, you might still have a pleasant joke by putting the pail in the place where it usually stands when it is empty, instead of on the table where you leave it when it is filled. Then Susan will be greatly surprised when she takes it up, intending to go for the milk.”  Arthur’s face grew very bright again.  “Oh, yes, father! I shall like that plan very much: it is much better than my own. And how shall I manage about Willie and Jane?”  “Try to think of some way yourself, Arthur. Only remember to have your joke of a kind that will give pleasure, and not pain.”  “I know of a grand trick to play upon Jane, father, if you will let me run to the shop and spend my bright half-dollar that my grandfather gave me. Jane has a hole in her thimble, and she pricked her finger sadly to-day. Now, I can buy a nice new thimble for her, and take her old one from her work-basket, and put the new one in its place. How surprised she will be! May I do this, father?”  “If you feel willing to spend your money for your sister,"]]]
