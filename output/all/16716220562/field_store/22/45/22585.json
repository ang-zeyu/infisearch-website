If he knew when he was talking to the tax-gatherers, that \"there was no money in the bag,\" he must have wondered how the half-shekel due as tribute could have been paid that day.  [Sidenote: Children of the Kingdom Free.]  When Peter went back into the house, Jesus anticipated what he was going to say, and asked Him, \"Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?  \"Of strangers,\" answered Peter.  \"Then are the children free,\" said Jesus, meaning that since this tribute money was for the maintenance of His Father's house, He, the Son, would not have to pay it; but he added:  \"Lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take and give unto them for me and thee.\"  This experience must have impressed Peter with the fact that it is better to suffer offense than to give offense.  A LESSON IN FORGIVENESS  About this same time, Peter asked the question:  \"Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?\" [3]  Perhaps Peter had already been required to settle some difficulty between angry men, or it may be that he had been provoked during a dispute that arose among the disciples as to who was the greatest among them. If some one had taunted him several times about his being the greatest, it is quite probable that his patience was exhausted. At any rate, he wanted to know if there is a limit to the number of times a man should forgive his brother. What a lesson Jesus taught this impetuous apostle when he answered,  \"I say not unto thee, until seven times; but until seventy times seven.\" [4]  Then, to make the teaching more impressive, the Lord told them the parable of the unmerciful debtor.  A certain king took account of his servants for those who had collected his revenue, and found that one owed him ten thousand talents or about fifteen million dollars. This debt the servant could not pay, so the king commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had. [5]  The servant begged for mercy saying, \"Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\"  \"Then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\" The master not only had pity for the unfortunate debtor, but freed him from prison, let him keep his wife and children, and cancelled the debt.  [Sidenote: The Ungrateful Servant.]  But that same servant went out and found one of his fellow-servants who owed him a hundred pence, more than ten hundred thousand times less than the first servant had owed his master.  Seizing the fellow-servant by the throat and choking him, he demanded, \"Pay me that thou owest.\"  The fellow-servant fell down at his feet and begged for mercy, \"Have patience with me and I will pay thee all.\"  But the unforgiving, merciless servant refusing to give pity, \"went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.\"  So when the Lord heard how the servant whom he had forgiven had treated his fellow-servant, he called that servant back, and said:  \"O thou wicked servant! I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; should not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?\"  This unforgiving servant was then told to pay the ten thousand talents, and was delivered over to the \"tormentors\" until it was all paid.  Then concluded the Savior: \"So likewise shall my Heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\"  Do you think Peter would ever forget that lesson?  THE REWARD OF SACRIFICE  [Sidenote: The Rich Young Ruler]  One day Peter and others listened to a conversation between their Lord and a rich young ruler. He was a young man, rich, and, as painted by the old masters, very handsome. But with all, he had kept himself morally clean, and desired to get eternal life. [6] But his heart was set upon his riches; so when the Savior said, \"Sell all thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me,\" the young ruler went away very sorrowful.  Then Peter said, \"Lo, we have left all and followed thee.\" As much as to say, Lord we have left everything for Thee, now what shall be our reward? Jesus said:  \"There is no man who has left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time; and in the world to come, life everlasting.\"  \"But,\" He added, \"there are many who make themselves first, that shall be last; and the last first.\"  [Sidenote: Humility.]  This last statement must have contained for Peter, the first among the Twelve, an important lesson in Humility.  A LESSON IN FAITH  It was probably on Tuesday of the last week that Jesus spent with His apostles, that Peter called attention to the result of a divine curse.  [Sidenote: The Barren Fig Tree.]  A day or so before this, Jesus had gone out of His way to get some figs from a tree that stood some distance off. When he found that the tree bore no fruit He said it should never bear fruit again.  On this Tuesday morning as the disciples were passing by, \"they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.\"  \"And Peter calling to remembrance said unto Him, Master, behold the fig tree which Thou cursedst is withered away.\"  [Sidenote: Power of Faith.]  Jesus answered: \"Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.\" [7]  On that same day, Peter was undoubtedly with the Twelve on the Mount of Olives when they asked Jesus \"privately\" about the destruction of the Temple. [8]  [Sidenote: Keep Commandments.]  To Peter and to all He said: \"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, and keep my commandments, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of Man when He shall come clothed in the glory of His Father.\"  Footnotes:  1. Ex. 30:13.  2. Matt. 17:24-27.  3. Matt. 18:21.  4. Matt. 18:22  5. See II Kings 4:1; Lev. 25:39.  6. Read Luke 18:18-30.  7. Mark 11:22-28.  8. Mark 13; Matt. 24; Luke 21.    LESSON 9  ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETRAYAL  \"The weakest spot in every man, is where he thinks himself the wisest.\"  IN THE UPPER ROOM  On Thursday of the Passion Week, Jesus called Peter and John to Him, and said: \"Go, and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.\" [1]  [Sidenote: The Passover.]  The Passover, you remember, is the name given to the feast established to commemorate the time when the destroying angel _passed over_ the houses of the Hebrews, which had been marked by the blood of the lamb. At this festsival, a lamb was killed, and called the Paschal Lamb. It was on the day that \"the passover must be killed\" that Peter and John were requested to make preparation.  \"Where wilt thou that we prepare?\" they asked.  [Sidenote: An Upper Room Prepared.]  \"When ye have entered into the city,\" replied Jesus, \"there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. Ask him, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples? And he shall show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.\" [2]  The two apostles did as they were directed, found everything just as the Lord had stated, and made the necessary preparations.  At the appointed hour Jesus and the Twelve gathered in this upper room. Some think it was in Mark's house, some the house of Joseph of Arimathea, but we do not know, nor does it much matter. We are interested most in what took place there.  [Sidenote: A Solemn Meeting.]  Jesus sat at the head of the feast. On one side, close enough to recline on His Master's breast sat John, and on the other side sat Peter. It was, perhaps, the most solemn meeting at which the Twelve had ever gathered; for the Savior said at the beginning:  \"With desire,\" that is with longing earnestness, \"I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled which is written in the prophets concerning me.\"  Meaning that His hour had come when His enemies should take Him and put Him to death.  Near the end of the supper, Jesus rose from where He was reclining, laid aside His outer garments, took a towel and tied it around His waist, thus assuming a servant's dress. He then took a basin of water and proceeded to wash the disciples' feet.  [Sidenote: Jesus Washeth Disciples' Feet.]  It may be that the Savior had detected in the minds of some the same thought which had caused a dispute among them once before, as to who was the greatest among them. Perhaps this thought arose when they saw Peter and John occupying the places of honor. At any rate, their Lord, the greatest among them, assumed the attitude of servant, the least and humblest of them all.  [Sidenote: Peter Objects.]  When He came to Peter, the latter said: \"Lord, dost _Thou_ wash _my_ feet?\" Peter would serve his Master, but his Master must never serve him!  \"What I do thou knowest not now: but thou shalt know hereafter,\" answered Jesus.  \"Thou needst not to wash my feet.\"  \"If I wash thee not,\" continued Jesus, \"thou hast no part with me.\"  When Peter thought that his refusal to submit to be served by the Lord, was really putting the Savior away from him, he said,  \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.\"  [Sidenote: An Example.]  \"So after He had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again. He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54309"],["title","Ancient Apostles (#8)"],["body","unto them: Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\"  Thus did these twelve men receive in an impressive and practical manner, the divine lesson of service. Thus did they learn that those who were greatest among them were really the servants of all. Indeed, in the Church of Christ, there are no masters and no servants, but all working for every one and each one for all.  [Sidenote: \"One of You Shall Betray Me.\"]  Immediately following this impressive and sacred ceremony, the full significance of which very few understand, the Savior said, \"One of you shall betray me.\"  This announcement cast a gloom over all. To make it caused \"trouble\" to come over Christ's \"spirit;\" and to hear it, made all \"exceeding sorrowful.\" [3]  They began to inquire among themselves which one of them should be so faithless; and soon each asked the Master, \"Lord, is it I?\"  Judas, last of all answered and said, \"Lord, is it I?\"  Jesus' answer, \"Thou hast said,\" must not have been heard by the others, because Peter beckoned to John to ask the Master \"who it should be of whom he spoke.\"  Jesus replied, also in a quiet manner, \"He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.\"  [Sidenote: Judas Iscariot.]  When he had dipped the sop, he handed it to Judas Iscariot. Peter and John, then, knew who the traitor was; but the others probably did not; for they wondered what Jesus meant when He said to Judas: \"That thou doest do quickly.\"  LOYALTY AS PETER FELT IT  After the traitor went out into the night--oh such a night for him! Jesus continued to teach and to comfort the Eleven.  [Sidenote: Love One Another.]  \"A new commandment I give unto you,\" He said, \"That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\"  Among other things, He said, referring to His approaching death, \"Whither I go ye cannot come.\"  This stirred Peter's love and he inquired, \"Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\" [4]  [Sidenote: Peter to Be Tried.]  \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, [that is, \"brought back afresh as a penitent disciple\"] strengthen thy brethren.\" [5]  This grieved Peter very deeply. To think that his Master would even suspect that he, _Peter_, would even weaken in his steadfastness to his Lord! (It is significant that the Lord called him by his old name, _Simon_).  Peter protested, saying, \"Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.\" [6]  [Sidenote: A Prophecy.]  \"I tell you, Peter,\" continued the Savior, \"that the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"  But, he spake the more vehemently. \"Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise so said they all.\" [7]  Peter meant every word he said, and he felt deeply the truth of what he spake; but his real strength had not come to him yet, and his Master knew it. It would come but it would be \"Born in the deep silence of a long-suffering heart.\"  LOYALTY AS PETER ACTED IT  [Sidenote: Gethsemane.]  Later in the night, the company left the upper room, crossed the brook Kedron, and went to the Garden of Gethsemane, on the west side of the Mount of Olives.  Bidding eight of the Eleven to remain together. He took the other three, Peter, James, and John, apart. His soul \"was exceeding sorrowful even unto death.\"  He said, \"Tarry ye here, and watch with me.\"  [Sidenote: \"Not My Will but Thine be Done.\"]  Soon He withdrew a little from them, and prayed. The Apostles could see Him, perhaps could hear Him, as He cried, \"Father, if it be possible let this cup pass; nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.\"  When he returned, and found the three sleeping, He said, \"Simon [Simon again] sleepest thou? Couldst not thou watch one hour?\"  \"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\"  \"The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.\" [8]  [Sidenote: Peter and His Brethren Drowsy.]  A second time He withdrew; a second time returned; a second time found them sleeping; \"for their eyes were heavy; neither knew they what to answer Him.\"  When He returned the third time, He said kindly, \"Sleep on now and take your rest; it is enough, the hour is come; behold the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\"  After a little longer sleep, the three were awakened by Jesus, only to see approaching \"a great multitude, with swords and staves, from the chief priests, and the scribes and the elders.\" At their head was Judas who approached his Lord, and betrayed Him with a kiss.  [Sidenote: Peter Defends His Lord.]  As soldiers went to lay hands upon Jesus, Peter, who was now thoroughly aroused, jumped to the rescue of his Master, \"drew his sword, and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.\"  This servant, whose right ear Peter struck off with one blow, was called Malchus.  [Sidenote: A Lesson.]  \"Put up thy sword into the sheath,\" commanded the Savior, \"the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?\" What a lesson to Peter! Even though duty led to suffering and death, yet would the Lord not waver in His strength.  Then said Jesus, \"Suffer ye thus far, and He touched his ear and healed him.\" [9]  As the officers led Jesus away, the disciples \"all forsook Him, and fled.\"  [Sidenote: Peter Follows Jesus.]  Peter's strength and loyalty were wavering; but he could not bring himself to flee with the others. Neither could he conclude that it was best to go with Jesus; so he did neither, but \"followed Him afar off, even unto the palace of the high priest.\"  At first, he remained on the outside, but later ventured in where the servants were sitting.  WEAKNESS BRINGS MISERY  While Peter was standing by the stove warming himself, a girl came in, and recognizing him as one who had been with Jesus, said, \"Thou, also wast with Jesus of Galilee.\"  [Sidenote: In a Moment of Weakness.]  \"I know not what thou sayest,\" said Peter before them all.  He then stepped out on the porch, perhaps to cool his burning conscience or to try to collect himself to know what best to do.  A man seeing him there cried out, \"This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.\"  \"I do not know the man,\" said Simon; and this time he took an oath.  One of the servants of the high priest, who was related to Malchus approached Peter a little later, and said, \"Did I not see thee in the Garden with Him?\" [10]  Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, \"Man, I know not what thou sayest.\" At that moment, Peter heard the cock crow.  [Sidenote: Sorrow.]  Almost immediately, too, the Savior passing near him, \"turned and looked upon Peter.\" Then recalling the words of his Lord, \"Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\" [11] Peter went out and wept bitterly.  Footnotes:  1. Luke 22:8.  2. Luke 22:11-12.  3. Matt. 26:22.  4. John 13:34-37.  5. Luke 22:31, 32.  6. Luke 22:33.  7. Matt. 26:35.  8. Mark 14:38.  9. Luke 22:51.  10. John 18:26.  11. Luke 22:61.    LESSON 10  OUT OF GLOOM, INTO LIGHT  \"Strength is born in the deep silence of long-suffering hearts, not amidst joy.\"  [Sidenote: Out of Weakness, Strength.]  It is said when Peter \"went out speechless from the face of all, * * * and filled the silence, weeping bitterly,\" that his grief was so heavy that he remained alone all day during Friday and Saturday following the Savior's crucifixion. If so, his sorrow for what he had done was made all the more acute as he recalled the many kind words the Savior had spoken to him, and the many, many happy moments he had spent in the Lord's company. Every word and act and look associated with his Master would flash upon his mind with a new meaning. Perhaps for the first time in his life, he now fully realized why the Lord had desired his nature and faith to be as \"The Rock.\" Through the mist of his bitter tears, he saw all the true attributes of manhood as they were personified in Jesus--Reverence, Brotherliness, Patience, Sincerity, Courage. These and many other noble traits made Jesus appear to him now more holy than ever. But the more clearly Peter saw Christ's strength and holiness, the more clearly he realized his own littleness and misery. This last manifestation of his weakness, which led him to deny his Lord, made him see himself in a new light, and it had a decisive effect upon him. Out of the \"deep silence\" of his suffering, those two days, there was born that strength which Christ had urged upon him ever since He called him \"Peter.\"  [Sidenote: A Sad Meeting.]  It must have been a sad meeting when John and Peter first came together after the Crucifixion. When it was or where, we are not told; but we are sure that John must have recognized a great change in his fellow-apostle. Out of the haggard look and the deep lines of grief there must have shone a humility which John had never before seen in Peter's face. We can only imagine what Peter's feelings were as he listened to John tell of all that had happened before Herod and Pilate, and at the Cross. Mingling with Peter's grief was the keen disappointment that their Messiah, their King, was not to free the Jews and rule over them as he had hoped. In doubt as to what to do, they probably decided to visit the place where their Master had been laid, and then return to their former vocation as fishermen.  [Sidenote: At the Sepulchre.]  But there was one whose love and devotion took her to the tomb even before the Apostles. Mary Magdalene, \"while it was yet dark\" approached the place where she thought Jesus slept in death. But instead of seeing her Lord's body in the cold, dark sepulchre, around which there was nothing but gloom and sorrow, she found an empty tomb. In alarm, she ran"]]]
