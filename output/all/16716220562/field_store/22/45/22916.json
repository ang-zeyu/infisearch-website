It has not nearly come to that yet, and what is more, it never shall.  You shall quit it certainly; but of your own free will, and holding your head high....\"  As he spoke the door of the outer room was hastily opened and the next instant Orion was standing before them, looking with great surprise at the pair who had just finished their meal.  He said coldly:  \"I am disturbing you, I see.\"  \"Not in the least,\" replied the leech; and the young man, perceiving what bad taste it would be and how much out of place to give expression to his jealous annoyance, said, with a smile: \"If only it had been granted to a third person to join in this symposium!\"  \"We found each other all-sufficient company,\" answered Philippus.  \"A man who could believe in all the doctrines of the Church as readily as in that statement would be assured of salvation,\" laughed Orion.  \"I am no spoilsport, respected friends; but I deeply regret that I must, on the present occasion, disturb your happiness.  The matter in question......\" And he felt he might now abandon the jesting tone which so little answered to his mood, \"is a serious one.  In the first instance it concerns your freedman, my fair foe.\"  \"Has Hiram come back?\"  asked Paula, feeling herself turn pale.  \"They have brought him in,\" replied Orion.  \"My father at once summoned the court of judges.  Justice has a swift foot here with us; I am sorry for the man, but I cannot prevent its taking its course.  I must beg of you to appear at the examination when you are called.\"  \"The whole truth shall be told!\"  said Paula sternly and firmly.  \"Of course,\" replied Orion.  Then turning to the physician, he added: \"I would request you, worthy Esculapius, to leave me and my cousin together for a few minutes.  I want to give her a word of counsel which will certainly be to her advantage.\"  Philippus glanced enquiringly at the girl; she said with clear decision: \"You and I can have no secrets.  What I may hear, Philippus too may know.\"  Orion, with a shrug, turned to leave the room:  On the threshold he paused, exclaiming with some excitement and genuine distress:  \"If you will not listen to me for your own sake, do so at least, whatever ill-feeling you may bear me, because I implore you not to refuse me this favor.  It is a matter of life or death to one human being, of joy or misery to another.  Do not refuse me.--I ask nothing unreasonable, Philippus.  Do as I entreat you and leave us for a moment alone.\"  Again the physician's eyes consulted the young girl's; this time she said: \"Go!\" and he immediately quitted the room.  Orion closed the door.  \"What have I done, Paula,\" he began with panting breath, \"that since yesterday you have shunned me like a leper--that you are doing your utmost to bring me to ruin?\"  \"I mean to plead for the life of a trusty servant; nothing more,\" she said indifferently.  \"At the risk of disgracing me!\"  he retorted bitterly.  \"At that risk, no doubt, if you are indeed so base as to throw your own guilt on the shoulders of an honest man.\"  \"Then you watched me last night?\"  \"The merest chance led me to see you come out of the tablinum....\"  \"I do not ask you now what took you there so late,\" he interrupted, \"for it revolts me to think anything of you but the best, the highest.--But you?  What have you experienced at my hands but friendship--nay, for concealment or dissimulation is here folly--but what a lover....?\"  \"A lover!\"  cried Paula indignantly.  \"A lover?  Dare you utter the word, when you have offered your heart and hand to another--you. . . .\"  \"Who told you so?\"  asked Orion gloomily.  \"Your own mother.\"  \"That is it; so that is it?\"  cried the young man, clasping his hands convulsively.  \"Now I begin to see, now I understand.  But stay.  For if it is indeed that which has roused you to hate me and persecute me, you must love me, Paula--you do love me, and then, noblest and sweetest....\" He held out his hand; but she struck it aside, exclaiming in a tremulous voice:  \"Be under no delusion.  I am not one of the feeble lambs whom you have beguiled by the misuse of your gifts and advantages; and who then are eager to kiss your hands.  I am the daughter of Thomas; and another woman's betrothed, who craves my embraces on the way to his wedding, will learn to his rueing that there are women who scorn his disgraceful suit and can avenge the insult intended them.  Go--go to your judges!  You, a false witness, may accuse Hiram, but I will proclaim you, you the son of this house, as the thief!  We shall see which they believe.\"  \"Me!\"  cried Orion, and his eyes flashed as wrathfully and vindictively as her own.  \"The son of the Mukaukas!  Oh, that you were not a woman! I would force you to your knees and compel you to crave my pardon.  How dare you point your finger at a man whose life has hitherto been as spotless as your own white raiment?  Yes, I did go to the tablinum--I did tear the emerald from the hanging; but I did it in a fit of recklessness, and in the knowledge that what is my father's is mine.  I threw away the gem to gratify  a mere fancy, a transient whim.  Cursed be the hour when I did it!--Not on account of the deed itself, but of the consequences it may entail through your mad hatred.  Jealousy, petty, unworthy jealousy is at the bottom of it!  And of whom are you jealous?\"  \"Of no one; not even of your betrothed, Katharina,\" replied Paula with forced composure.  \"What are you to me that, to spare you humiliation, I should risk the life of the most honest soul living?  I have said: The judges shall decide between you.\"  \"No, they shall not!\"  stormed Orion.  \"At least, not as you intend! Beware, beware, I say, of driving me to extremities!  I still see in you the woman I loved; I still offer you what lies within my power: to let everything end for the best for you. . . .\"  \"For me!  Then I, too, am to suffer for your guilt?\"  \"Did you hear the barking of hounds just now?\"  \"I heard dogs yelping.\"  \"Very well.--Your freedman has been brought in, the pack got on his scent and have now been let into the house close to the tablinum.  The dogs would not stir beyond the threshold and on the white marble step, towards the right-hand side, the print of a man's foot was found in the dust.  It is a peculiar one, for instead of five toes there are but three.  Your Hiram was fetched in, and he was found to have the same number of toes as the mark on the marble, neither more nor less.  A horse trod on his foot, in your father's stable, and two of his toes had to be cut off: we got this out of the stammering wretch with some difficulty. --On the other side of the door-way there was a smaller print, but though the dogs paid no heed to that I examined it, and assured myself--how, I need not tell you--that it was you who had stood there.  He, who has no business whatever in the house, must have made his way last night into the tablinum, our treasury.  Now, put yourself in the judges' place.  How can such facts be outweighed by the mere word of a girl who, as every one knows, is on anything rather than good terms with my mother, and who will leave no stone unturned to save her servant.\"  \"Infamous!\"  cried Paula.  \"Hiram did not steal the gem, as you must know who stole it.  The emerald he sold was my property; and were those stones really so much alike that even the seller. . .\"  \"Yes, indeed.  He could not tell one from the other.  Evil spirits have been at work all through, devilish, malignant demons.  It would be enough to turn one's brain, if life were not so full of enigmas!  You yourself are  the  greatest.--Did you give the Syrian your emerald to sell in order to fly from this house with the money?--You are silent?  Then I am right.  What can my father be to you--you do not love my mother--and the son!--Paula, Paula, you are perhaps doing him an injustice--you hate him, and it is a pleasure to you to injure him.\"  \"I do not wish to hurt you or any one,\" replied the girl.  \"And you have guessed wrongly.  Your father refused me the means of seeking mine.\"  \"And you wanted to procure money to search for one who is long since dead!--Even my mother admits that you speak the truth; if she is right, and you really take no pleasure in doing me a mischief, listen to me, follow my advice, and grant my prayer!  I do not ask any great matter.\"  \"Speak on then.\"  \"Do you know what a man's honor is to him?  Need I tell you that I am a lost and despised man if I am found guilty of this act of the maddest folly by the judges of my own house?  It may cost my father his life if he hears that the word 'guilty' is pronounced on me; and I--I--what would become of me I cannot foresee!--I--oh God, oh God, preserve me from frenzy!--But I must be calm; time presses....  How different it is for your servant; he seems ready even now to take the guilt on himself, for, whatever he is asked, he still keeps silence.  Do you do the same; and if the judges insist on knowing what you had to do with the Syrian last night--for the dogs traced the scent to your staircase--hazard a conjecture that the faithful fellow stole the emerald in order to gratify your desire to search for your father, his beloved master.  If you can make up your mind to so great a sacrifice--oh, that I should have to ask it of you!--I swear to you by all I hold sacred, by yourself and by my father's head, I will set Hiram free within three days, unbeaten and unhurt, and magnificently indemnified; and I will myself help him on the way whither he may desire to go, or you to send him, in search of your father.--Be silent; remain neutral in the background; that is all I ask, and I will keep my word--that, at any rate, you do not doubt?\"  She had listened to him with bated breath; she pitied him deeply as he stood there, a suppliant in bitter anguish of soul, a criminal who still could not understand that he was one, and who relied on the confidence that, only yesterday, he still had had the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5519"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 03 (#6)"],["body","to exact from all the world. He appeared before her like a fine proud tree struck by lightning, whose riven trunk, trembling to its fall, must be crushed to the earth by the first storm, unless the gardener props it up.  She longed to be able to forget all he had brought upon her and to grasp his hand in friendly consolation; but her deeply aggrieved pride helped her to preserve the cold and repellent manner she had so far succeeded in assuming.  With much hesitation and reserve she consented to be silent as long as he kept his promise.  It was for his father's sake, rather than his own, that she would so far become his accomplice: at the same time everything else was at an end between them, and she should bless the hour which might see her severed from him and his for ever.  The end of her speech was in a strangely hard and repellent tone; she felt she must adopt it to disguise how deeply she was touched by his unhappiness and by the extinction of the sunshine in him which had once warmed her own heart too with bliss.  To him it seemed that an icy rigor breathed in her words--bitter contempt and hostile revulsion.  He had some difficulty in keeping himself from breaking out again in violent wrath.  He was almost sorry that he had trusted her with his secret and begged her for mercy, instead of leaving things to run their course, and if it had come to the worst, dragging her to perdition with him.  Sooner would he forfeit honor and peace than humble himself again before this pitiless and cold-hearted foe.  At this moment he really hated her, and only wished it were possible to fight her, to break her pride, to see her vanquished and crying for quarter at his feet.  It was with a great effort--with tingling cheeks and constrained utterance that he said:  \"Severance from you is indeed best for us all.--Be ready: the judges will send for you soon.\"  \"Very well,\" she replied.  \"I will be silent; you have only to provide for the Syrian's safety.  You have given me your word.\"  \"And so long as you keep yours I will keep mine.  Or else. . .\"  the words would come from his quivering lips--\"or else war to the knife!\"  \"War to the knife!\"  she echoed with flashing eyes.  \"But one thing more. I have proof that the emerald which Hiram sold belonged to me.  By all the saints--proof!\"  \"So much the better for you,\" he said.  \"Woe to us both, if you force me to forget that you are a woman!\"  And he left the room with a rapid step.     CHAPTER XII.  Orion went down stairs scowling and clenching his fists.  His heart ached to bursting.  What had he done, what had befallen him?  That a woman should dare to treat him so!--a woman whom he had deigned to love--the loveliest and noblest of women; but at the same time the haughtiest, most vengeful, and most hateful.  He had once read this maxim: \"When a man has committed a base action, if only one other knows of it he carries the death-warrant of his peace in the bosom of his garment.\"  He felt the full weight of this sentence; and the other--the one who knew--was Paula, the woman of all others whom he most wished should look up to him.  But yesterday it had been a vision of heaven on earth to dream of holding her in his arms and calling her his; now he had but one wish: that he could humble and punish her.  Oh, that his hands should be tied, that he should be dependent on her mercy like a condemned criminal!  It was inconceivable--intolerable!  But she should be taught to know him.  He had passed through life hitherto as white as a swan; if this luckless hour and this woman made him appear as a vulture, it was not his fault, it was hers.  She should soon see which was the stronger of the two.  He would punish her in every way in which a woman can be punished, even if the way to it led through crime and misery!  He was not afraid that the leech bad won her affections, for he knew, with strange certainty that, in spite of the hostility she displayed, her heart was his and his alone.  \"The gold coin called love,\" said he to himself, \"has two faces: tender devotion and bitter aversion; just now she is showing me the latter.  But, however different the image and superscription may be on the two sides, if you ring it, it always gives out the same tone; and I can hear it even in her most insulting words.\"  When the family met at table he made Paula's excuses; he himself ate only a few mouthfuls, for the judges had assembled some time since and were waiting for him.  The right of life and death had been placed in the hands of the ancestors of the Mukaukas, powerful princes of provinces; they had certainly wielded it even in the dynasty of Psammitichus, whose power had been put to a terrible end by Cambyses the Persian.  And still the Uraeus snake-- the asp whose bite caused almost instant death, reared its head as the time-honored emblem of this privilege, by the side of St. George the Dragon-slayer, over the palaces of the Mukaukas at Memphis, and at Lykopolis in Upper Egypt.  And in both these places the head of the family retained the right of arbitrary judgment and capital punishment over the retainers of his house and the inhabitants of the district he governed, after Justinian first, and then the Emperor Heraclius, had confirmed them in their old prerogative.  The chivalrous St. George was placed between the snakes so as to replace a heathen symbol by a Christian one.  Formerly indeed the knight himself had had the head of a sparrow-hawk: that is to say of the god Horus, who had overthrown the evil-spirit, Seth-Typhon, to avenge his father; but about two centuries since the heathen crocodile-destroyer had been transformed into the Christian conqueror of the dragon.  After the Arab conquest the Moslems had left all ancient customs and rights undisturbed, including those of the Mukaukas.  The court which assembled to sit in judgment on all cases concerning the adherents of the house consisted of the higher officials of the governor's establishment.  The Mukaukas himself was president, and his grown-up son was his natural deputy.  During Orion's absence, Nilus, the head of the exchequer, a shrewd and judicious Egyptian, had generally represented his invalid master; but on the present occasion Orion was appointed to take his place, and to preside over the assembly.  The governor's son hastened to his father's bedroom to beg him to lend him his ring as a token of the authority transferred to him; the Mukaukas had willingly allowed him to take it off his finger, and had enjoined him to exercise relentless severity.  Generally he inclined to leniency; but breaking into a house was punishable with death, and in this instance it was but right to show no mercy, out of deference to the Arab merchant. But Orion, mindful of his covenant with Paula, begged his father to give him full discretion.  The old Moslem was a just man, who would agree to a mitigated sentence under the circumstances; besides, the culprit was not in strict fact a member of the household, but in the service of a relation.  The Mukaukas applauded his son's moderation and judgment.  If only he had been in rather better health he himself would have had the pleasure of being present at the sitting, to see him fulfil for the first time so important a function, worthy of his birth and position.  Orion kissed his father's hand with heart-felt but melancholy emotion, for this praise from the man he so truly loved was a keen pleasure; and yet he felt that it was of ill-omen that his duties as judge, of which he knew the sacred solemnity, should be thus--thus begun.  It was in a softened mood, sunk in thought as to how he could best save Hiram and leave Paula's name altogether out of the matter, that he went to the hall of justice; and there he found the nurse Perpetua in eager discussion with Nilus.  The old woman was quite beside herself.  In the clatter of her loom she had heard nothing of what had been going on till a few minutes ago; now she was ready to swear to the luckless Hiram's innocence.  The stone he had sold had belonged to his young mistress, and thank God there was no lack of evidence of the fact; the setting of the emerald was lying safe and sound in Paula's trunk.  Happily she had had an opportunity of speaking to her; and that she, the daughter of Thomas, should be brought before the tribunal, like a citizen's daughter or slave-girl, was unheard of, shameful!  At this Orion roughly interfered; he desired the old gate-keeper to conduct Perpetua at once to the storeroom next to the tablinum, where the various stuffs prepared for the use of the household were laid by, and to keep her there under safe guard till further notice.  The tone in which he gave the order was such that even the nurse did not remonstrate; and Nilus, for his part obeyed in silence when Orion bid him return to his place among the judges.  Nilus went back to the judgment-hall in uneasy consternation.  Never before had he seen his young lord in this mood.  As he heard the nurse's statement the veins had swelled in his smooth youthful forehead, his nostrils had quivered with convulsive agitation, his voice had lost all its sweetness, and his eyes had a sinister gleam.  Orion was now alone; he ground his teeth with rage.  Paula had betrayed him in spite of her promise, and how mean was her woman's cunning! She could be silent before the judges--yes.  Silent in all confidence now, to the very last; but the nurse, her mouthpiece, had already put Nilus, the keenest and most important member of the court, in possession of the evidence which spoke for her and against him.  It was shocking, disgraceful!  Base and deliberately malicious treachery.  But the end was not yet: he still was free to act and to ward off the spiteful stroke by a counterthrust.  How it should be dealt was clear from Perpetua's statement; but his conscience, his instincts and long habits of submission to what was right, good, and fitting held him back. Not only had he never"]]]
