He is kindly disposed, and you should--you should--\"  \"Pentaur will come?\"  said the girl eagerly.  \"Before midday.  But how do you know his name?\"  \"I know him,\" said Uarda decidedly.  The surgeon looked at her surprised.  \"You must not talk any more,\" he said, \"for your cheeks are glowing, and the fever may return.  We have arranged a tent for you, and now we will carry you into the open air.\"  \"Not yet,\" said the girl.  \"Grandmother, do my hair for me, it is so heavy.\"  With these words she endeavored to part her mass of long reddish-brown hair with her slender hands, and to free it from the straws that had got entangled in it.  \"Lie still,\" said the surgeon, in a warning voice.  \"But it is so heavy,\" said the sick girl, smiling and showing Nebsecht her abundant wealth of golden hair as if it were a fatiguing burden. \"Come, grandmother, and help me.\"  The old woman leaned over the child, and combed her long locks carefully with a coarse comb made of grey horn, gently disengaged the straws from the golden tangle, and at last laid two thick long plaits on her granddaughter's shoulders.  Nebsecht knew that every movement of the wounded girl might do mischief, and his impulse was to stop the old woman's proceedings, but his tongue seemed spell-bound.  Surprised, motionless, and with crimson cheeks, he stood opposite the girl, and his eyes followed every movement of her hands with anxious observation.  She did not notice him.  When the old woman laid down the comb Uarda drew a long breath.  \"Grandmother,\" she said, \"give me the mirror.\"  The old woman brought a shard of dimly glazed, baked clay.  The girl turned to the light, contemplated the undefined reflection for a moment, and said:  \"I have not seen a flower for so long, grandmother.\"  \"Wait, child,\" she replied; she took from a jug the rose, which the princess had laid on the bosom of her grandchild, and offered it to her. Before Uarda could take it, the withered petals fell, and dropped upon her.  The surgeon stooped, gathered them up, and put them into the child's hand.  \"How good you are!\"  she said; \"I am called Uarda--like this flower--and I love roses and the fresh air.  Will you carry me out now?\"  Nebsecht called the paraschites, who came into the hut with his son, and they carried the girl out into the air, and laid her under the humble tent they had contrived for her.  The soldier's knees trembled while he held the light burden of his daughter's weight in his strong hands, and he sighed when he laid her down on the mat.  \"How blue the sky is!\"  cried Uarda.  \"Ah! grandfather has watered my pomegranate, I thought so! and there come my doves! give me some corn in my hand, grandmother.  How pleased they are.\"  The graceful birds, with black rings round their reddish-grey necks, flew confidingly to her, and took the corn that she playfully laid between her lips.  Nebsecht looked on with astonishment at this pretty play.  He felt as if a new world had opened to him, and some new sense, hitherto unknown to him, had been revealed to him within his breast.  He silently sat down in front of the but, and drew the picture of a rose on the sand with a reed- stem that he picked up.  Perfect stillness was around him; the doves even had flown up, and settled on the roof.  Presently the dog barked, steps approached; Uarda lifted herself up and said:  \"Grandmother, it is the priest Pentaur.\"  \"Who told you?\"  asked the old woman.  \"I know it,\" answered the girl decidedly, and in a few moments a sonorous voice cried: \"Good day to you.  How is your invalid?\"  Pentaur was soon standing by Uarda; pleased to hear Nebsecht's good report, and with the sweet face of the girl.  He had some flowers in his hand, that a happy maiden had laid on the altar of the Goddess Hathor, which he had served since the previous day, and he gave them to the sick girl, who took them with a blush, and held them between her clasped hands.  \"The great Goddess whom I serve sends you these,\" said Pentaur, \"and they will bring you healing.  Continue to resemble them.  You are pure and fair like them, and your course henceforth may be like theirs.  As the sun gives life to the grey horizon, so you bring joy to this dark but. Preserve your innocence, and wherever you go you will bring love, as flowers spring in every spot that is trodden by the golden foot of Hathor.       [Hathor is frequently called \"the golden,\" particularly at Dendera      She has much in common with the \"golden Aphrodite.\"]  May her blessing rest upon you!\"  He had spoken the last words half to the old couple and half to Uarda, and was already turning to depart when, behind a heap of dried reeds that lay close to the awning over the girl, the bitter cry of a child was heard, and a little boy came forward who held, as high as he could reach, a little cake, of which the dog, who seemed to know him well, had snatched half.  \"How do you come here, Scherau?\"  the paraschites asked the weeping boy; the unfortunate child that Hekt was bringing up as a dwarf.  \"I wanted,\" sobbed the little one, \"to bring the cake to Uarda.  She is ill--I had so much--\"  \"Poor child,\" said the paraschites, stroking the boy's hair; \"there-give it to Uarda.\"  Scherau went up to the sick girl, knelt down by her, and whispered with streaming eyes:  \"Take it!  It is good, and very sweet, and if I get another cake, and Hekt will let me out, I will bring it to you.  \"Thank you, good little Scherau,\" said Uarda, kissing the child.  Then she turned to Pentaur and said:  \"For weeks he has had nothing but papyrus-pith, and lotus-bread, and now he brings me the cake which grandmother gave old Hekt yesterday.\"  The child blushed all over, and stammered:  \"It is only half--but I did not touch it.  Your dog bit out this piece, and this.\"  He touched the honey with the tip of his finger, and put it to his lips. \"I was a long time behind the reeds there, for I did not like to come out because of the strangers there.\"  He pointed to Nebsecht and Pentaur. \"But now I must go home,\" he cried.  The child was going, but Pentaur stopped him, seized him, lifted him up in his arms and kissed him; saying, as he turned to Nebsecht:  \"They were wise, who represented Horus--the symbol of the triumph of good over evil and of purity over the impure--in the form of a child.  Bless you, my little friend; be good, and always give away what you have to make others happy.  It will not make your house rich--but it will your heart!\"  Scherau clung to the priest, and involuntarily raised his little hand to stroke Pentaur's cheek.  An unknown tenderness had filled his little heart, and he felt as if he must throw his arms round the poet's neck and cry upon his breast.  But Pentaur set him down on the ground, and he trotted down into the valley.  There he paused.  The sun was high in the heavens, and he must return to the witch's cave and his board, but he would so much like to go a little farther--only as far as to the king's tomb, which was quite near.  Close by the door of this tomb was a thatch of palm-branches, and under this the sculptor Batau, a very aged man, was accustomed to rest.  The old man was deaf, but he passed for the best artist of his time, and with justice; he had designed the beautiful pictures and hieroglyphic inscriptions in Seti's splendid buildings at Abydos and Thebes, as well as in the tomb of that prince, and he was now working at the decoration of the walls in the grave of Rameses.  Scherau had often crept close up to him, and thoughtfully watched him at work, and then tried himself to make animal and human figures out of a bit of clay.  One day the old man had observed him.  The sculptor had silently taken his humble attempt out of his hand, and had returned it to him with a smile of encouragement.  From that time a peculiar tie had sprung up between the two.  Scherau would venture to sit down by the sculptor, and try to imitate his finished images.  Not a word was exchanged between them, but often the deaf old man would destroy the boy's works, often on the contrary improve them with a touch of his own hand, and not seldom nod at him to encourage him.  When he staid away the old man missed his pupil, and Scherau's happiest hours were those which he passed at his side.  He was not forbidden to take some clay home with him.  There, when the old woman's back was turned, he moulded a variety of images which he destroyed as soon as they were finished.  While he lay on his rack his hands were left free, and he tried to reproduce the various forms which lived in his imagination, he forgot the present in his artistic attempts, and his bitter lot acquired a flavor of the sweetest enjoyment.  But to-day it was too late; he must give up his visit to the tomb of Rameses.  Once more he looked back at the hut, and then hurried into the dark cave.     CHAPTER XIV.  Pentauer also soon quitted the but of the paraschites.  Lost in meditation, he went along the hill-path which led to the temple which Ameni had put under his direction.       [This temple is well proportioned, and remains in good preservation.      Copies of the interesting pictures discovered in it are to be found      in the \"Fleet of an Egyptian queen\" by Dutnichen.

D.W.]      UARDA  Volume 4.  By Georg Ebers    CHAPTER XV.  The afternoon shadows were already growing long, when a splendid chariot drew up to the gates of the terrace-temple.  Paaker, the chief pioneer, stood up in it, driving his handsome and fiery Syrian horses.  Behind him stood an Ethiopian slave, and his big dog followed the swift team with his tongue out.  As he approached the temple he heard himself called, and checked the pace of his horses.  A tiny man hurried up to him, and, as soon as he had recognized in him the dwarf Nemu, he cried angrily:  \"Is it for you, you rascal, that I stop my drive?  What do you want?\"  \"To crave,\" said the little man, bowing humbly, \"that, when thy business in the city of the dead is finished, thou wilt carry me back to Thebes.\"  \"You are Mena's dwarf?\"  asked the pioneer.  \"By no means,\" replied Nemu.  \"I belong to his neglected wife, the lady Nefert.  I can only cover the road very slowly with my little legs, while the hoofs of your horses devour the way-as a crocodile does his prey.\"  \"Get up!\"  said Paaker.  \"Did you come here on foot?\"  \"No, my lord,\" replied Nemu, \"on an ass; but a demon entered into the beast, and has struck it with sickness.  I had to leave it on the road. The beasts of Anubis will have a better supper than we to-night.\"  \"Things are not done handsomely then at your mistress's house?\"  asked Paaker.  \"We still have bread,\" replied Nemu, \"and the Nile is full of water. Much meat is not necessary for women and dwarfs, but our last cattle take a form which is too hard for human teeth.\"  The pioneer did not understand the joke, and looked enquiringly at the dwarf.  \"The form of money,\" said the little man, \"and that cannot be chewed; soon that will be gone too, and then the point will be to find a recipe for making nutritious cakes out of earth, water, and palm-leaves.  It makes very little difference to me, a dwarf does not need much--but the poor tender lady!\"  Paaker touched his horses with such a violent stroke of his whip that they reared high, and it took all his strength to control their spirit.  \"The horses' jaws will be broken,\" muttered the slave behind.  \"What a shame with such fine beasts!\"  \"Have you to pay for them?\"  growled Paaker.  Then he turned again to the dwarf, and asked:  \"Why does Mena let the ladies want?\"  \"He no longer cares for his wife,\" replied the dwarf, casting his eyes down sadly.  \"At the last division of the spoil he passed by the gold and silver; and took a foreign woman into his tent.  Evil demons have blinded him, for where is there a woman fairer than Nefert?\"  \"You love your mistress.\"  \"As my very eyes!\"  During this conversation they had arrived at the terrace-temple.  Paaker threw the reins to the slave, ordered him to wait with Nemu, and turned to the gate-keeper to explain to him, with the help of a handful of gold, his desire of being conducted to Pentaur, the chief of the temple.  The gate-keeper, swinging a censer before him with a hasty action, admitted him into the sanctuary.  You will find him on the third terrace,\" he said, \"but he is no longer our superior.\"  \"They said so in the temple of Seti, whence I have just come,\" replied Paaker.  The porter shrugged his shoulders with a sneer, and said: \"The palm-tree that is quickly set up falls down more quickly still.\"  Then he desired a servant to conduct the stranger to Pentaur.  The poet recognized the Mohar at once, asked his will, and learned that he was come to have a wonderful vision interpreted by him.  Paaker explained before relating his dream, that he did not ask this service for nothing; and when the priest's countenance darkened he added:  \"I will send a fine beast for sacrifice to the Goddess if the interpretation is favorable.\"  \"And in the opposite case?\"  asked Pentaur, who, in the House of Seti, never would have anything whatever to do with the payments of the worshippers or the offerings of the devout.  \"I will offer a sheep,\" replied Paaker, who did not perceive the subtle irony that lurked in Pentaur's words, and who was accustomed to pay for the gifts of the Divinity in proportion to their value to himself.  Pentaur thought of the verdict which Gagabu, only two evenings since, had passed on the Mohar, and it occurred to him that he would test how far the man's superstition would lead him.  So he asked, while he suppressed a smile:  \"And if I can foretell nothing bad, but also nothing actually good?\"--  \"An antelope, and four geese,\" answered Paaker promptly.  \"But if I were altogether disinclined to put myself at your service?\" asked Pentaur.  \"If I thought it unworthy of a priest to let the Gods be paid in proportion to their favors towards a particular person, like corrupt officials; if I now showed you--you--and I have known you from a school-boy, that there are things that cannot be bought with inherited wealth?\"  The pioneer drew back astonished and angry, but Pentaur continued calmly--  \"I stand here as the minister of the Divinity; and nevertheless, I see by your countenance, that you were on the point of lowering yourself by showing to me your violent and extortionate spirit.  \"The Immortals send us dreams, not to give us a foretaste of joy or caution us against danger, but to remind us so to prepare our souls that we may submit quietly to suffer evil, and with heartfelt gratitude accept the good; and so gain from each profit for the inner life.  I will not interpret your dream!  Come without gifts, but with a humble heart, and with longing for inward purification, and I will pray to the Gods that they may enlighten me, and give you such interpretation of even evil dreams that they may be fruitful in blessing.  \"Leave me, and quit the temple!\"  Paaker ground his teeth with rage; but he controlled himself, and only said as he slowly withdrew:  \"If your office had not already been taken from you, the insolence with which you have dismissed me might have cost you your place.  We shall meet again, and then you shall learn that inherited wealth in the right hand is worth more than you will like.\"  \"Another enemy!\"  thought the poet, when he found himself alone and stood erect in the glad consciousness of having done right.  During Paaker's interview with the poet, the dwarf Nemu had chatted to the porter, and had learned from him all that had previously occurred.  Paaker mounted his chariot pale with rage, and whipped on his horses before the dwarf had clambered up the step; but the slave seized the little man, and set him carefully on his feet behind his master.  \"The villian, the scoundrel!  he shall repent it--Pentaur is he called! the hound!\"  muttered the pioneer to himself.  The dwarf lost none of his words, and when he caught the name of Pentaur he called to the pioneer, and said--  \"They have appointed a scoundrel to be the superior of this temple; his name is Pentaur.  He was expelled from the temple of Seti for his immorality, and now he has stirred up the younger scholars to rebellion, and invited unclean women into the temple.  My lips hardly dare repeat it, but the gate-keeper swore it was true--that the chief haruspex from the House of Seti found him in conference with Bent-Anat, the king's daughter, and at once deprived him of his office.\"  \"With Bent-Anat?\"  replied the pioneer, and muttered, before the dwarf could find time to answer, \"Indeed, with Bent-Anat!\"  and he recalled the day before yesterday, when the princess had remained so long with the priest in the hovel of the paraschites, while he had talked to Nefert and visited the old witch.  \"I should not care to be in the priest's skin,\" observed Nemu, \"for though Rameses is far away, the Regent Ani is near enough.  He is a gentleman who seldom pounces, but even the dove won't allow itself to be attacked in is own nest.\"  Paaker looked enquiringly at Nemu.  \"I know,\" said the dwarf \"Ani has asked Rameses' consent to marry his daughter.\"  \"He has already asked it,\" continued the dwarf as Paaker smiled incredulously, \"and the king is not disinclined to give it.  He likes making marriages--as thou must know pretty well.\"  \"I?\"  said Paaker, surprised.  \"He forced Katuti to give her daughter as wife to the charioteer. That I know from herself.  She can prove it to thee.\"  Paaker shook his head in denial, but the dwarf continued eagerly, \"Yes, yes!  Katuti would have had thee for her son-in-law, and it was the king, not she, who broke off the betrothal.  Thou must at the same time have been inscribed in the black books of the  high gate, for Rameses used many hard names for thee.  One of us is like a mouse behind the curtain, which knows a good deal.\"  Paaker suddenly brought his horses to a stand-still, threw the reins to the slave, sprang from the chariot, called the dwarf to his side, and said:  \"We will walk from here to the river, and you shall tell me all you know; but if an untrue word passes your lips I will have you eaten by my dogs.\"  \"I know thou canst keep thy word,\" gasped the little man.  \"But go a little slower if thou wilt, for I am quite out of breath.  Let Katuti herself tell thee how it all came about.  Rameses compelled her to give her daughter to the charioteer.  I do not know what he said of thee, but it was not complimentary.  My poor mistress!  she let herself be caught by the dandy, the ladies' man-and now she may weep and wail.  When I pass the great gates of thy house with Katuti, she often sighs and complains bitterly.  And with good reason, for it soon will be all over with our noble estate, and we must seek an asylum far away among the Amu in the low lands; for the nobles will soon avoid us as outcasts.  Thou mayst be glad that thou hast not linked thy fate to ours; but I have a faithful heart, and"]]]
