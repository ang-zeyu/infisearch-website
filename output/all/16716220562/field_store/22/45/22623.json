The mute slave picked it up, and laid it carefully on the table again, while his master threw a ball into a silver bason.  Several attendants rushed into the room, and Ani ordered them to bring to him the captive dwarf of the Lady Katuti.  His soul rose in indignation against the king, who in his remote camp-tent could fancy he had made him happy by a proof of his highest favor.  When we are plotting against a man we are inclined to regard him as an enemy, and if he offers us a rose we believe it to be for the sake, not of the perfume, but of the thorns.  The dwarf Nemu was brought before the Regent and threw himself on the ground at his feet.  Ani ordered the attendants to leave him, and said to the little man  \"You compelled me to put you in prison.  Stand up!\"  The dwarf rose and said, \"Be thanked--for my arrest too.\"  The Regent looked at him in astonishment; but Nemu went on half humbly, half in fun, \"I feared for my life, but thou hast not only not shortened it, but hast prolonged it; for in the solitude of the dungeon time seemed long, and the minutes grown to hours.\"  \"Keep your wit for the ladies,\" replied the Regent.  \"Did I not know that you meant well, and acted in accordance with the Lady Katuti's fancy, I would send you to the quarries.\"  \"My hands,\" mumbled the dwarf, \"could only break stones for a game of draughts; but my tongue is like the water, which makes one peasant rich, and carries away the fields of another.\"  \"We shall know how to dam it up.\"  \"For my lady and for thee it will always flow the right way,\" said the dwarf.  \"I showed the complaining citizens who it is that slaughters their flesh and blood, and from whom to look for peace and content.  I poured caustic into their wounds, and praised the physician.\"  \"But unasked and recklessly,\" interrupted Ani; \"otherwise you have shown yourself capable, and I am willing to spare you for a future time.  But overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies.  When I need your services I will call for you.  Till then avoid speech.  Now go to your mistress, and carry to Katuti this letter which has arrived for her.\"  \"Hail to Ani, the son of the Sun!\"  cried the dwarf kissing the Regent's foot.  \"Have I no letter to carry to my mistress Nefert?\"  \"Greet her from me,\" replied the Regent.  \"Tell Katuti I will visit her after the next meal.  The king's charioteer has not written, yet I hear that he is well.  Go now, and be silent and discreet.\"  The dwarf quitted the room, and Ani went into an airy hall, in which his luxurious meal was laid out, consisting of many dishes prepared with special care.  His appetite was gone, but he tasted of every dish, and gave the steward, who attended on him, his opinion of each.  Meanwhile he thought of the king's letter, of Bent-Anat, and whether it would be advisable to expose himself to a rejection on her part.  After the meal he gave himself up to his body-servant, who carefully shaved, painted, dressed, and decorated him, and then held the mirror before him.  He considered the reflection with anxious observation, and when he seated himself in his litter to be borne to the house of his friend Katuti, he said to himself that he still might claim to be called a handsome man.  If he paid his court to Bent-Anat--if she listened to his suit--what then?  He would refer it to Katuti, who always knew how to say a decisive word when he, entangled in a hundred pros and cons, feared to venture on a final step.  By her advice he had sought to wed the princess, as a fresh mark of honor--as an addition to his revenues--as a pledge for his personal safety.  His heart had never been more or less attached to her than to any other beautiful woman in Egypt.  Now her proud and noble personality stood before his inward eye, and he felt as if he must look up to it as to a vision high out of his reach.  It vexed him that he had followed Katuti's advice, and he began to wish his suit had been repulsed. Marriage with Bent-Anat seemed to him beset with difficulties.  His mood was that of a man who craves some brilliant position, though he knows that its requirements are beyond his powers--that of an ambitious soul to whom kingly honors are offered on condition that he will never remove a heavy crown from his head.  If indeed another plan should succeed, if-- and his eyes flashed eagerly--if fate set him on the seat of Rameses, then the alliance with Bent-Anat would lose its terrors; there would he be her absolute King and Lord and Master, and no one could require him to account for what he might be to her, or vouchsafe to her.     CHAPTER V.  During the events we have described the house of the charioteer Mena had not remained free from visitors.  It resembled the neighboring estate of Paaker, though the buildings were less new, the gay paint on the pillars and walls was faded, and the large garden lacked careful attention.  In the vicinity of the house only, a few well-kept beds blazed with splendid flowers, and the open colonnade, which was occupied by Katuti and her daughter, was furnished with royal magnificence.  The elegantly carved seats were made of ivory, the tables of ebony, and they, as well as the couches, had gilt feet.  The artistically worked Syrian drinking vessels on the sideboard, tables, and consoles were of many forms; beautiful vases full of flowers stood everywhere; rare perfumes rose from alabaster cups, and the foot sank in the thick pile of the carpets which covered the floor.  And over the apparently careless arrangement of these various objects there reigned a peculiar charm, an indescribably fascinating something.  Stretched at full-length on a couch, and playing with a silky-haired white cat, lay the fair Nefert--fanned to coolness by a negro-girl--while her mother Katuti nodded a last farewell to her sister Setchem and to Paaker.  Both had crossed this threshold for the first time for four years, that is since the marriage of Mena with Nefert, and the old enmity seemed now to have given way to heartfelt reconciliation and mutual understanding.  After the pioneer and his mother had disappeared behind the pomegranate shrubs at the entrance of the garden, Katuti turned to her daughter and said:  \"Who would have thought it yesterday?  I believe Paaker loves you still.\"  Nefert colored, and exclaimed softly, while she hit the kitten gently with her fan--  \"Mother!\"  Katuti smiled.  She was a tall woman of noble demeanor, whose sharp but delicately-cut features and sparkling eyes could still assert some pretensions to feminine beauty.  She wore a long robe, which reached below her ankles; it was of costly material, but dark in color, and of a studied simplicity.  Instead of the ornaments in bracelets, anklets, ear and finger-rings, in necklaces and clasps, which most of the Egyptian ladies --and indeed her own sister and daughter--were accustomed to wear, she had only fresh flowers, which were never wanting in the garden of her son-in-law.  Only a plain gold diadem, the badge of her royal descent, always rested, from early morning till late at night, on her high brow-- for a woman too high, though nobly formed--and confined the long blue- black hair, which fell unbraided down her back, as if its owner contemned the vain labor of arranging it artistically.  But nothing in her exterior was unpremeditated, and the unbejewelled wearer of the diadem, in her plain dress, and with her royal figure, was everywhere sure of being observed, and of finding imitators of her dress, and indeed of her demeanor.  And yet Katuti had long lived in need; aye at the very hour when we first make her acquaintance, she had little of her own, but lived on the estate of her son-in-law as his guest, and as the administrator of his possessions; and before the marriage of her daughter she had lived with her children in a house belonging to her sister Setchem.  She had been the wife of her own brother,       [Marriages between brothers and sisters were allowed in ancient      Egypt.  The Ptolemaic princes adopted this, which was contrary to      the Macedonian customs.  When Ptolemy II.  Philadelphus married his      sister Arsinoe, it seems to have been thought necessary to excuse it      by the relative positions of Venus and Saturn at that period, and      the constraining influences of these planets.]  who had died young, and who had squandered the greatest part of the possessions which had been left to him by the new royal family, in an extravagant love of display.  When she became a widow, she was received as a sister with her children by her brother-in-law, Paaker's father.  She lived in a house of her own, enjoyed the income of an estate assigned to her by the old Mohar, and left to her son-in-law the care of educating her son, a handsome and overbearing lad, with all the claims and pretensions of a youth of distinction.  Such great benefits would have oppressed and disgraced the proud Katuti, if she had been content with them and in every way agreed with the giver. But this was by no means the case; rather, she believed that she might pretend to a more brilliant outward position, felt herself hurt when her heedless son, while he attended school, was warned to work more seriously, as he would by and by have to rely on his own skill and his own strength.  And it had wounded her when occasionally her brother-in- law had suggested economy, and had reminded her, in his straightforward way, of her narrow means, and the uncertain future of her children.  At this she was deeply offended, for she ventured to say that her relatives could never, with all their gifts, compensate for the insults they heaped upon her; and thus taught them by experience that we quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor whom we can never repay for all the good he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5441"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 03 (#3)"],["body","on us.  Nevertheless, when her brother-in-law asked the hand of her daughter for his son, she willingly gave her consent.  Nefert and Paaker had grown up together, and by this union she foresaw that she could secure her own future and that of her children.  Shortly after the death of the Mohar, the charioteer Mena had proposed for Nefert's hand, but would nave been refused if the king himself had not supported the suit of his favorite officer.  After the wedding, she retired with Nefert to Mena's house, and undertook, while he was at the war, to manage his great estates, which however had been greatly burthened with debt by his father.  Fate put the means into her hands of indemnifying herself and her children for many past privations, and she availed herself of them to gratify her innate desire to be esteemed and admired; to obtain admission for her son, splendidly equipped, into a company of chariot-warriors of the highest class; and to surround her daughter with princely magnificence.  When the Regent, who had been a friend of her late husband, removed into the palace of the Pharaohs, he made her advances, and the clever and decided woman knew how to make herself at first agreeable, and finally indispensable, to the vacillating man.  She availed herself of the circumstance that she, as well as he, was descended from the old royal house to pique his ambition, and to open to him a view, which even to think of, he would have considered forbidden as a crime, before he became intimate with her.  Ani's suit for the hand of the princess Bent-Anat was Katuti's work.  She hoped that the Pharoah would refuse, and personally offend the Regent, and so make him more inclined to tread the dangerous road which she was endeavoring to smooth for him.  The dwarf Nemu was her pliant tool.  She had not initiated him into her projects by any words; he however gave utterance to every impulse of her mind in free language, which was punished only with blows from a fan, and, only the day before, had been so audacious as to say that if the Pharoah were called Ani instead of Rameses, Katuti would be not a queen but a goddess for she would then have not to obey, but rather to guide, the Pharaoh, who indeed himself was related to the Immortals.  Katuti did not observe her daughter's blush, for she was looking anxiously out at the garden gate, and said:  \"Where can Nemu be!  There must be some news arrived for us from the army.\"  \"Mena has not written for so long,\" Nefert said softly.  \"Ah! here is the steward!\"  Katuti turned to the officer, who had entered the veranda through a side door:  \"What do you bring,\" she asked.  \"The dealer Abscha,\" was the answer, \"presses for payment.  The new Syrian chariot and the purple cloth--\"  \"Sell some corn,\" ordered Katuti.  \"Impossible, for the tribute to the temples is not yet paid, and already so much has been delivered to the dealers that scarcely enough remains over for the maintenance of the household and for sowing.\"  \"Then pay with beasts.\"  \"But, madam,\" said the steward sorrowfully, \"only yesterday, we again sold a herd to the Mohar; and the water-wheels must be turned, and the corn must be thrashed, and we need beasts for sacrifice, and milk, butter, and cheese, for the use of the house, and dung for firing.\"       [In Egypt, where there is so little wood, to this day the dried dung      of beasts is the commonest kind of fuel.]  Katuti looked thoughtfully at the ground.  \"It  must  be,\"  she  said  presently.  \"Ride  to Hermonthis, and say to the keeper of the stud that he must have ten of Mena's golden bays driven over here.\"  \"I have already spoken to him,\" said the steward, \"but he maintains that Mena strictly forbade him to part with even one of the horses, for he is proud of the stock.  Only for the chariot of the lady Nefert \"  \"I require obedience,\" said Katuti decidedly and cutting short the steward's words, \"and I expect the horses to-morrow.\"  \"But the stud-master is a daring man, whom Mena looks upon as indispensable, and he--\"  \"I command here, and not the absent,\" cried Katuti enraged, \"and I require the horses in spite of the former orders of my son-in-law.\"  Nefert, during this conversation, pulled herself up from her indolent attitude.  On hearing the last words she rose from her couch, and said, with a decision which surprised even her mother--  \"The orders of my husband  must  be  obeyed.  The horses that Mena loves shall stay in their stalls.  Take this armlet that the king gave me; it is worth more than twenty horses.\"  The steward examined the trinket, richly set with precious stones, and looked enquiringly at Katuti.  She shrugged her shoulders, nodded consent, and said--  \"Abscha shall hold it as a pledge till Mena's booty arrives.  For a year your husband has sent nothing of importance.\"  When the steward was gone, Nefert stretched herself again on her couch and said wearily:  \"I thought we were rich.\"  \"We might be,\" said Katuti bitterly; but as she perceived that Nefert's cheeks again were glowing, she said amiably, \"Our high rank imposes great duties on us.  Princely blood flows in our veins, and the eyes of the people are turned on the wife of the most brilliant hero in the king's army.  They shall not say that she is neglected by her husband.  How long Mena remains away!\"  \"I hear a noise in the court,\" said Nefert.  \"The Regent is coming.\"  Katuti turned again towards the garden.  A breathless slave rushed in, and announced that Bent-Anat, the daughter of the king, had dismounted at the gate, and was approaching the garden with the prince Rameri.  Nefert left her couch, and went with her mother to meet the exalted visitors.  As the mother and daughter bowed to kiss the robe of the princess, Bent- Anat signed them back from her.  \"Keep farther from me,\" she said; \"the priests have not yet entirely absolved me from my uncleanness.\"  \"And in spite of them thou art clean in the sight of Ra!\"  exclaimed the boy who accompanied her, her brother of seventeen, who was brought up at the House of Seti, which however he was to leave in a few weeks--and he kissed her.  \"I shall complain to Ameni of this wild boy,\" said Bent-Anat smiling. \"He would positively accompany me.  Your husband, Nefert, is his model, and I had no peace in the house, for we came to bring you good news.\"  \"From Mena?\"  asked the young wife, pressing her hand to her heart.  \"As you say,\" returned Bent-Anat.  \"My father praises his ability, and writes that he, before all others, will have his choice at the dividing of the spoil.\"  Nefert threw a triumphant glance at her mother, and Katuti drew a deep breath.  Bent-Anat stroked Nefert's cheeks like those of a child.  Then she turned to Katuti, led her into the garden, and begged her to aid her, who had so early lost her mother, with her advice in a weighty matter.  \"My father,\" she continued, after a few introductory words, \"informs me that the Regent Ani desires me for his wife, and advises me to reward the fidelity of the worthy man with my hand.  He advises it, you understand- he does not command.\"  \"And thou?\"  asked Katuti.  \"And I,\" replied Bent-Anat decidedly, \"must refuse him.\"  \"Thou must!\"  Bent-Anat made a sign of assent and went on:  \"It is quite clear to me.  I can do nothing else.\"  \"Then thou dost not need my counsel, since even thy father, I well know, will not be able to alter thy decision.\"  \"Not God even,\" said Anat firmly.  \"But you are Ani's friend, and as I esteem him, I would save him from this humiliation.  Endeavor to persuade him to give up his suit.  I will meet him as though I knew nothing of his letter to my father.\"  Katuti looked down reflectively.  Then she said--\"The Regent certainly likes very well to pass his hours of leisure with me gossiping or playing draughts, but I do not know that I should dare to speak to him of so grave a matter.\"  \"Marriage-projects are women's affairs,\" said Bent-Anat, smiling.  \"But the marriage of a princess is a state event,\" replied the widow. \"In this case it is true the uncle       [Among the Orientals--and even the Spaniards--it was and is common      to give the name of uncle to a parent's cousin.]  only courts his niece, who is dear to him, and who he hopes will make the second half of his life the brightest.  Ani is kind and without severity. Thou would'st win in him a husband, who would wait on thy looks, and bow willingly to thy strong will.\"  Bent-Anat's eyes flashed, and she hastily exclaimed: \"That is exactly what forces the decisive irrevocable 'No' to my lips.  Do you think that because I am as proud as my mother, and resolute like my father, that I wish for a husband whom I could govern and lead as I would?  How little you know me!  I will be obeyed by my dogs, my servants, my officers, if the Gods so will it, by my children.  Abject beings, who will kiss my feet, I meet on every road, and can buy by the hundred, if I wish it, in the slave market.  I may be courted twenty times, and reject twenty suitors, but not because I fear that they might bend my pride and my will; on the contrary, because I feel them increased.  The man to whom I could wish to offer my hand must be of a loftier stamp, must be greater, firmer, and better than I, and I will flutter after the mighty wing- strokes of his spirit, and smile at my own weakness, and glory in admiring his superiority.\"  Katuti listened to the maiden with the smile by which the experienced love to signify their superiority over the visionary.  \"Ancient times may have produced such men,\" she said.  \"But if in these days thou thinkest to find one, thou wilt wear the lock of youth,       [The lock of youth was a curl of hair which all the younger members      of princely families wore at the side of the head.  The young Horus      is represented with it.]  till thou art grey.  Our thinkers are no heroes, and our heroes are no sages.  Here come thy brother and Nefert.\"  \"Will you persuade Ani to give up his suit!\""]]]
