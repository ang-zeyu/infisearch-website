But how can I help being so little?  You know very well when any one laughs at me for it......\"  \"You  get angry  and slap!\"  retorted the child, walking on.  \"Yesterday, perhaps, I might have laughed over a box on the ear--it is not the first --or have given it to you back again; but to-day!--Just now,\" and she shuddered involuntarily, \"just now I felt as if some black slave had laid his dirty hand on my cheek.  You are not what you were.  You walk quite differently, and you look--depend upon it you do not look as nice and as bright as you used, and I know why: You did a very bad thing last evening.\"  \"But dear pet,\" said the other, \"you must not be so hard.  Perhaps I did not really tell the judges everything I knew, but Orion, who loves me so, and whose wife I am to be. . . .\"  \"He led you into sin!--Yes; and he was always merry and kind till yesterday; but since--Oh, that unlucky day!\"  Here she was interrupted by Eudoxia, who poured out a flood of reproaches and finally desired her to resume her task.  The child obeyed unresistingly; but she had scarcely settled to her wax tablets again when Katharina was by her side, whispering to her that Orion would certainly not have asserted anything that he did not believe to be true, and that she had really been in doubt as to whether a gem with a gold back, or a mere gold frame-work, had been hanging to Paula's chain.  At this Mary turned sharply and quickly upon her, looked her straight in the eyes and exclaimed--but in Egyptian that the governess might not understand, for she had disdained to learn a single word of it:  \"A rubbishy gold frame with a broken edge was hanging to the chain, and, what is more, it caught in your dress.  Why, I can see it now!  And, when you bore witness that it was a gem, you told a lie--Look here; here are the laws which God Almighty himself gave on the sacred Mount of Sinai, and there it stands written: 'Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.'  And those who do, the priest told me, are guilty of mortal sin, for which there is no forgiveness on earth or in Heaven, unless after bitter repentance and our Saviour's special mercy.  So it is written; and you could actually declare before the judges a thing that was false, and that you knew would bring others to ruin?\"  The young criminal looked down in shame and confusion, and answered hesitatingly:  \"Orion asserted it so positively and clearly, and then--I do not know what came over me--but I was so angry, so--I could have murdered her!\"  \"Whom?\" asked Mary in surprise.  \"You know very well: Paula.\"  \"Paula!\" said Mary, and her large eyes again filled with tears.  \"Is it possible?  Did you not love her as much as I do?  Have not you often and often clung about her like a bur?\"  \"Yes, yes, very true.  But before the judges she was so intolerably proud, and then.--But believe me, Mary you really and truly cannot understand anything of all this.\"  \"Can I not?\" asked the child folding her arms.  \"Why do you think me so stupid?\"  \"You are in love with Orion--and he is a man whom few can match, over head and ears in love; and because Paula looks like a queen by the side of you, and is so much handsomer and taller than you are, and Orion, till yesterday--I could see it all--cared a thousand times more for her than for you, you were jealous and envious of her.  Oh, I know all about it. --And I know that all the women fall in love with him, and that Mandaile had her ears cut off on his account, and that it was a lady who loved him in Constantinople that gave him the little white dog.  The slave-girls tell me what they hear and what I like.--And after all, you may well be jealous of Paula, for if she only made a point of it, how soon Orion would make up his mind never to look at you again!  She is the handsomest and the wisest and the best girl in the whole world, and why should she not be proud?  The false witness you bore will cost poor Hiram his life: but the merciful Saviour may forgive you at last.  It is your affair, and no concern of mine; but when Paula is forced to leave the house and all through you, so that I shall never, never, never see her any more--I cannot forget it, and I do not think I ever shall; but I will pray God to make me.\"  She burst into loud sobs, and the governess had started up to put an end to a dialogue which she could not understand, and which was therefore vexatious and provoking, when the water-wagtail fell on her knees before the little girl, threw her arms round her, and bursting into tears, exclaimed:  \"Mary--darling little Mary forgive me.       [The German has the diminutive 'Mariechen'.  To this Dr. Ebers      appends this note.  \"An ignorant critic took exception to the use of      the diminutive form of names (as for instance 'Irenchen', little      Irene) in 'The Sisters,' as an anachronism.  It is nevertheless a      fact that the Greeks settled in Egypt were so fond of using the      diminutive form of woman's names that they preferred them, even in      the tax-rolls.  This form was common in Attic Greek,\"]  Oh, if you could but know what I endured before I came out here!  Forgive me, Mary; be my sweet, dear little Mary once more.  Indeed and indeed you are much better than I am.  Merciful Saviour, what possessed me last evening?  And all through him, through the man no one can help loving-- through Orion!--And would you believe it: I do not even know why he led me into this sin.  But I must try to care for him no more, to forget him entirely, although, although,--only think, he called me his betrothed; but now that he has betrayed me into sin, can I dare to become his wife? It has given me no peace all night.  I love him, yes I love him, you cannot think how dearly; still, I cannot be his!  Sooner will I go into a convent, or drown myself in the Nile!--And I will say all this to my mother, this very day.\"  The Greek governess had looked on in astonishment, for it was indeed strange to see the young girl kneeling in front of the child.  She listened to her eager flow of unintelligible words, wondering whether she could ever teach her pupil--with her grandmother's help if need should be--to cultivate a more sedate and Greek demeanor.  At this juncture Paula came down the path.  Some slaves followed her, carrying several boxes and bundles and a large litter, all making their way to the Nile, where a boat was waiting to ferry her up the river to her new home.  As she lingered unobserved, her eye rested on the touching picture of the two young things clasped in each other's arms, and she overheard the last words of the gentle little creature who had done her such cruel wrong. She could only guess at what had occurred, but she did not like to be a listener, so she called Mary; and when the child started up and flew to throw her arms round her neck with vehement and devoted tenderness, she covered her little face and hair with kisses.  Then she freed herself from the little girl's embrace, and said, with tearful eyes:  \"Good-bye, my darling!  In a few minutes I shall no longer belong here; another and a strange home must be mine.  Love me always, and do not forget me, and be quite sure of one thing: you have no truer friend on earth than I am.\"  At this, fresh tears flowed; the child implored her not to go away, not to leave her; but Paula could but refuse, though she was touched and astonished to find that she had reaped so rich a harvest of love, here where she had sown so little.  Then she gave her hand at parting to the governess, and when she turned to Katharina, to bid farewell, hard as it was, to the murderer of her happiness, the young girl fell at her feet bathed in tears of repentance, covered her knees and hands with kisses, and confessed herself guilty of a terrible sin.  Paula, however, would not allow her to finish; she lifted her up, kissed her forehead, and said that she quite understood how she had been led into it, and that she, like Mary, would try to forgive her.  Standing by the governor's many-oared barge, to which the young girls now escorted her, she found Orion.  Twice already this morning he had tried in vain to get speech with her, and he looked pale and agitated.  He had a splendid bunch of flowers in his hand; he bestowed a hasty greeting on Mary and his betrothed, and did not heed the fact that Katharina returned it hesitatingly and without a word.  He went close up to Paula, told her in a low voice that Hiram was safe, and implored her, as she hoped to be forgiven for her own sins, to grant him a few minutes.  When she rejected his prayer with a silent shrug, and went on towards the boat he put out his hand to help her, but she intentionally overlooked it and gave her hand to the physician.  At this he sprang after her into the barge, saying in her ear in a tremulous whisper:  \"A wretch, a miserable man entreats your mercy.  I was mad yesterday.  I love you, I love you--how deeply!--you will see!\"  \"Enough,\" she broke in firmly, and she stood up in the swaying boat. Philippus supported her, and Orion, laying the flowers in her lap, cried so that all could hear: \"Your departure will sorely distress my father. He is so ill that we did not dare allow you to take leave of him.  If you have anything to say to him. . .\"  \"I will find another messenger,\" she replied sternly.  \"And if he asks the reason for your sudden departure?\"  \"Your mother and Philippus can give him an answer.\"  \"But he was your guardian, and your fortune, I know. . .\"  \"In his hands it is safe.\"  \"And if the physician's fears should be justified?\"  \"Then I will demand its restitution through a new Kyrios.\"  \"You will receive it without that!  Have you no pity, no forgiveness?\" For all answer she flung the flowers he had given her "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5520"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 04 (#4)"],["body","the river; he leaped on shore, and regardless of the bystanders, pushed his fingers through his hair, clasping his hands to his burning brow.  The barge was pushed off, the rowers plied their oars like men; Orion gazed after it, panting with laboring breath, till a little hand grasped his, and Mary's sweet, childish voice exclaimed:  \"Be comforted, uncle.  I know just what is troubling you.\"  \"What do you know?\"  he asked roughly.  \"That you are sorry that you and Katharina should have spoken against her last evening, and against poor Hiram.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  he angrily broke in.  \"Where is Katharina?\"  \"I was to tell you that she could not see you today.  She loves you dearly, but she, too, is so very, very sorry.\"  \"She may spare herself!\"  said the young man.  \"If there is anything to be sorry for it falls on me--it is crushing me to death.  But what is this!--The devil's in it!  What business is it of the child's?  Now, be off with you this minute.  Eudoxia, take this little girl to her tasks.\"  He took Mary's head between his hands, kissed her forehead with impetuous affection, and then pushed her towards her governess, who dutifully led her away.  When Orion found himself alone, he leaned against a tree and groaned like a wounded wild beast.  His heart was full to bursting.  \"Gone, gone!  Thrown away, lost!  The best on earth!\"  He laid his hands on the tree-stem and pressed his head against it till it hurt him.  He did not know how to contain himself for misery and self-reproach.  He felt like a man who has been drunk and has reduced his own house to ashes in his intoxication.  How all this could have come to pass he now no longer knew.  After his nocturnal ride he had caused Nilus the treasurer to be waked, and had charged him to liberate Hiram secretly.  But it was the sight of his stricken father that first brought him completely to his sober senses.  By his bed-side, death in its terrible reality had stared him in the face, and he had felt that he could not bear to see that beloved parent die till he had made his peace with Paula, won her forgiveness, brought her whom his father loved so well into his presence, and besought his blessing on her and on himself.  Twice he had hastened from the chamber of suffering to her room, to entreat her to hear him, but in vain; and now, how terrible had their parting been!  She was hard, implacable, cruel; and as he recalled her person and individuality as they had struck him before their quarrel, he was forced to confess that there was something in her present behavior which was not natural to her.  This inhuman severity in the beautiful woman whose affection had once been his, and who, but now, had flung his flowers into the water, had not come from her heart; it was deliberately planned to make him feel her anger.  What had withheld her, under such great provocation, from betraying that she had detected him in the theft of the emerald?  All was not yet lost; and he breathed more freely as he went back to the house where duty, and his anxiety for his father, required his presence.  There were his flowers, floating on the stream.  \"Hatred cast them there,\" thought he, \"but before they reach the sea many blossoms will have opened which were mere hard buds when she flung them away.  She can never love any man but me, I feel it, I know it.  The first time we looked into each other's eyes the fate of our hearts was sealed.  What she hates in me is my mad crime; what first set her against me was her righteous anger at my suit for Katharina.  But that sin was but a dream in my life, which can never recur; and as for Katharina--I have sinned against her once, but I will not continue to sin through a whole, long lifetime.  I have been permitted to trifle with love unpunished so often, that at last I have learnt to under-estimate its power.  I could laugh as I sacrificed mine to my mother's wishes; but that, and that alone, has given rise to all these horrors.  But no, all is not yet lost!  Paula will listen to me; and when she sees what my inmost feelings are--when I have confessed all to her, good and evil alike--when she knows that my heart did but wander, and has returned to her who has taught me that love is no jest, but solemn earnest, swaying all mankind, she will come round--everything will come right.\"  A noble and rapturous light came into his face, and as he walked on, his hopes rose:  \"When she is mine I know that everything good in me that I have inherited from my forefathers will blossom forth.  When my mother called me to my father's bed-side, she said: 'Come, Orion, life is earnest for you and me and all our house, your father. . .'  Yes, it is earnest indeed, however all this may end!  To win Paula, to conciliate her, to bring her near to me, to have her by my side and do something great, something worthy of her--this is such a purpose in life as I need!  With her, only with her I know I could achieve it; without her, or with that gilded toy Katharina, old age will bring me nothing but satiety, sobering and regrets--or, to call it by its Christian designation: bitter repentance.  As Antaeus renewed his strength by contact with mother earth, so, father do I feel myself grow taller when I only think of her.  She is salvation and honor; the other is ruin and misery in the future.  My poor, dear Father, you will, you must survive this stroke to see the fulfilment of all your joyful hopes of your son.  You always loved Paula; perhaps you may be the one to appease her and bring her back to me; and how dear will she be to you, and, God willing, to my mother, too, when you see her reigning by my side an ornament to this house, to this city, to this country--reigning like a queen, your son's redeeming and guardian angel!\"  Uplifted, carried away by these thoughts, he had reached the viridarium. He there found Sebek the steward waiting for his young master: \"My lord is asleep now,\" he whispered, \"as the physician foretold, but his face... Oh, if only we had Philippus here again!\"  \"Have you sent the chariot with the fast horses to the Convent of St. Cecilia?\"  asked Orion eagerly; and when Sebek had replied in the affirmative and vanished again indoors, the young man, overwhelmed with painful forebodings, sank on his knees near a column to which a crucifix was hung, and lifted up his hands and soul in fervent prayer.     CHAPTER XV.  The physician had installed Paula in her new home, and had introduced her to the family who were henceforth to be her protectors, and to enable her to lead a happier life.  He had but a few minutes to devote to her and her hosts; for scarcely had he taken her into the spacious rooms, gay with flowers, of which she now took possession, when he was enquired for by two messengers, both anxious to speak with him.  Paula knew how critical her uncle's state was, and now, contemplating the probability of losing him, she first understood what he had been to her.  Thus sorrow was her first companion in her new abode--a sorrow to which the comfort of her pretty, airy rooms added keenness.  One of the messengers was a young Arab from the other side of the river, who handed to Philippus a letter from the merchant Haschim.  The old man informed him that, in consequence of a bad fall his eldest son had had, he was forced to start at once for Djiddah on the Red Sea.  He begged the physician to take every care of his caravan-leader, to whom he was much attached, to remove him when he thought fit from the governor's house, and to nurse him till he was well, in some quiet retreat.  He would bear in mind the commission given him by the daughter of the illustrious Thomas.  He sent with this letter a purse well-filled with gold pieces.  The other messenger was to take the leech back again in the light chariot with the fast horses to the suffering Mukaukas.  He at once obeyed the summons, and the steeds, which the driver did not spare, soon carried him back to the governor's house.  A glance at his patient told him that this was the beginning of the end; still, faithful to his principle of never abandoning hope till the heart of the sufferer had ceased to beat, he raised the senseless man, heedless of Orion, who was on his knees by his father's pillow, signed to the deaconess in attendance, an experienced nurse, and laid cool, wet cloths on the head and neck of the sufferer, who was stricken with apoplexy. Then he bled him.  Presently the Mukaukas wearily opened his eyes, turned uneasily from side to side, and recognizing his kneeling son and his wife, bathed in tears, he murmured, almost inarticulately, for his paralyzed tongue no longer did his will: \"Two pillules, Philip!\"  The physician unhesitatingly acceded to the request of the dying man, who again closed his eyes; but only to reopen them, and to say, with the same difficulty, but with perfect consciousness:  \"The end is at hand!  The blessing of the Church--Orion, the Bishop.\"  The young man hastened out of the room to fetch the prelate, who was waiting in the viridarium with two deacons, an exorcist, and a sacristan bearing the sacred vessels.  The governor listened in devout composure to the service of the last sacrament, looked on at the ceremonies performed by the exorcist as, with waving of hands and pious ejaculations he banned the evil spirits and cast out from the dying man the devil that might have part in him; but he could no longer swallow the bread which, in the Jacobite rite, was administered soaked in the wine.  Orion took the holy elements for him, and the dying man, with a smile, murmured to his son:  \"God be with thee, my son!  The Lord, it seems, denies me His precious Blood--and yet--let me try once more.\"  This time he succeeded in swallowing the wine and a few crumbs of bread; and the bishop Ptolimus, a gentle old man of a beautiful and dignified presence, spoke comfort to him, and asked him whether he felt that he was dying penitent and in perfect faith in the mercy of his "]]]
