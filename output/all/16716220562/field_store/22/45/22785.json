The friends were again alone.  Gorgias had his hands full of work, but he could not help expressing his surprise at the calm bearing which Dion maintained.  \"You behave as if you were going to an oyster supper at Kanopus,\" he said, shaking his head as though perplexed by some incomprehensible problem.  \"What else would you have me do?\"  asked the Macedonian.  \"The vivid imagination of you artists shows you the future according to your own varying moods.  If you hope, you transform a pleasant garden into the Elysian fields; if you fear anything you behold in a burning roof the conflagration of a world.  We, from whose cradle the Muse was absent, who use only sober reason to provide for the welfare of the household and the state, as well as for our own, see facts as they are and treat them like figures in a sum.  I know that Barine is in danger.  That might drive me frantic; but beyond her I see Archibius and Charmian spreading their protecting wings over her head; I perceive the fear of my faction, including the museum, of the council of which I am a member, of my clients and the conditions of the times, which precludes arousing the wrath of the citizens.  The product which results from the correct addition of all these known quantities--\"  \"Will be correct,\" interrupted his friend, \"so long as the most incalculable of all factors, passion, does not blend with them--the passion of a woman--and the Queen belongs to the sex which is certainly more powerful in that domain.\"  \"Granted!  But as soon as Mark Antony returns it will be proved that her jealousy was needless.\"  \"We will hope so.  It is only the misled, deceived, abused Cleopatra whom I fear; for she herself is matchless in divine goodness.  The charm by which she ensnares hearts is indescribable, and the iron power of her intellect!  I tell you, Dion--\"  \"Friend, friend,\" was the laughing interruption.  \"How high your wishes soar!  For three years I have kept an account of the conflagrations in your heart.  I believe we had reached seventeen; but this last one is equal to two.\"  \"Folly!\" cried Gorgias in an irritated tone: \"May not a man admire what is magnificent, wonderful, unique?  She is all these things!  Just now-- how long ago is it?--she appeared before me in a radiance of beauty--\"  \"Which should have made you shade both eyes.  Yet you have been speaking so warmly of your young guest, her loving caution, her gentle calmness in the midst of peril--\"  \"Do you suppose I wish to recall a single syllable?\" the architect indignantly broke in.  \"Helena has no peer among the maidens of Alexandria--but the other--Cleopatra--is elevated in her divine majesty above all ordinary mortals.  You might spare me and yourself that scornful curl of the lip.  Had she gazed into your face with those tearful, sorrowful eyes, as she did into mine, and spoken of her misery, you would have gone through fire and water, hand in hand with me, for her sake.  I am not a man who is easily moved, and since my father's death the only tears I have seen have been shed by others; but when she talked of the mausoleum I was to build for her because Fate, she knew not how soon, might force her to seek refuge in the arms of death, my calmness vanished.  Then, when she cumbered me among the friends on whom she could rely and held out her hand--a matchless hand--oh! laugh if you choose-- I felt I know not how, and kneeling at her feet I kissed it; it was wet with my tears.  I am not ashamed of this emotion, and my lips seem consecrated since they touched the little white hand which spoke a language of its own and stands before my eyes wherever I gaze.\"  Pushing back his thick locks from his brow as he spoke, he shook his head as though dissatisfied with himself and, in an altered tone, hurriedly continued: \"But this is a time ill-suited for such ebullitions of feeling.  I mentioned the mausoleum, whose erection the Queen desires. She will see the first hasty sketch to-morrow.  It is already before my mind's eye.  She wished to have it adjoin the Temple of Isis, her goddess--I proposed the great sanctuary in the Rhakotis quarter, but she objected--she wished to have it close to the palace at Lochias.  She had thought of the temple at the Corner of the Muses, but the house occupied by Didymus stood in the way of a larger structure.  If this were removed it would be possible to carry the street through the old man's garden, perhaps even to the sea-shore, and we should have had space for a gigantic edifice and still left room for a fine garden.  But we had learned how the philosopher loved his family estate.  The Queen is unwilling to use violence towards the old man.  She is just, and perhaps other reasons, of which I am ignorant, influence her.  So I promised to look for another site, though I saw how much she desired to have her tomb connected with the sanctuary of her favourite goddess  Then--I have already told the clever brown witch--then the immortals, Divinity, Fate, or whatever we call the power which guides the world and our lives according to eternal laws and its own mysterious, omnipotent will, permitted a rascally deed, from which I think may come deliverance for you and a source of pleasure to the Queen in these days of trial.\"  \"Man, man!  Where will this new passion lead you?  The horses are stamping impatiently outside; duty summons the most faithful of men, and he stands like a prophet, indulging in mysterious sayings!\"  \"Whose meaning and purport, spite of your calm calculations of existing circumstances, will soon seem no less wonderful to you than to me, whose unruly artist nature, according to your opinion, is playing me a trick,\" retorted the architect.  \"Now listen to this explanation: Didymus's house will be occupied at once by my workmen, but I shall examine the lower rooms of the Temple of Isis.  I have with me a document requiring obedience to my orders.  Cleopatra herself laid the plans before me, even the secret portion showing the course of the subterranean chambers. It will cast some light upon my mysterious sayings if I bear you away from the enemy through one of the secret corridors.  They were right in concealing from you by how slender a thread, spite of the power of your example in mathematics, the sword hangs above your head.  Now that I see a possibility of removing it, I can show it to you.  Tomorrow you would have fallen, without hope of rescue, into the hands of cruel foes and been shamefully abandoned by your own weak uncle, had not the most implacable of all your enemies permitted himself the infamous pleasure of laying hands on an old man's house, and the Queen, in consequence of an agitating message, had the idea suggested of building her own mausoleum. The corridor\"--here he lowered his voice--\"of which I spoke leads to the sea at a spot close beside Didymus's garden, and through it I will guide you, and, if possible, Barine also, to the shore.  This could be accomplished in the usual way only by the greatest risk.  If we use the passage we can reach a dark place on the strand unseen, and unless some special misfortune pursues us our flight will be unnoticed.  The litters and your tottering gait would betray everything if we were to enter the boat anywhere else in the great harbour.\"  \"And we, sensible folk, refuse to believe in miracles!\" cried Dion, holding out his wan hand to the architect.  \"How shall I thank you, you dear, clever, most loyal of friends to your male friends, though your heart is so faithless to fair ones?  Add that malicious speech to the former ones, for which I now crave your pardon.  What you intend to accomplish for Barine and me gives you a right to do and say to me whatever ill you choose all the rest of my life.  Anxiety for her would surely have bound me to this house and the city when the time came to make the escape, for without her my life would now be valueless.  But when I think that she might follow me to Pyrrhus's cliff--\"  \"Don't flatter yourself with this hope,\" pleaded Gorgias.  \"Serious obstacles may interpose.  I am to have another talk with the Nubian later.  With no offence to others, I believe her advice will be the best. She knows how matters stand with the lofty, and yet herself belongs to the lowly.  Besides, through Charmian the way to the Queen lies open, and nothing which happens at court escapes her notice.  She showed me that we must consider Barine's delivery to Alexas a piece of good fortune.  How easily jealousy might have led to a fatal crime one whose wish promptly becomes action, unless she curbs the undue zeal of her living tools! Those on whom Fate inflicts so many blows rarely are in haste to spare others.  Would the anxieties which weigh upon her like mountains interpose between the Queen and the jealous rancour which is too petty for her great soul?\"  \"What is great or petty to the heart of a loving woman?\"  asked Dion. \"In any case you will do what you can to remove Barine from the power of the enraged princess--I know.\"  Gorgias pressed his friend's hand closely, then, yielding to a sudden impulse, kissed him on the forehead and hurried to the door.  On the threshold a faint moan from the wounded man stopped him.  Would he be strong enough to follow the long passage leading to the sea?  Dion protested that he confidently expected to do so, but his deeply flushed face betrayed that the fever which had once been conquered had returned.  Gorgias's eyes sought the floor in deep thought.  Many sick persons were borne to the temple in the hope of cure; so Dion's appearance would cause no special surprise.  On the other hand, to have strangers carry him through the passage seemed perilous.  He himself was strong, but even the strongest person would have found it impossible to support"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5478"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 06 (#5)"],["body","heavy burden of a grown man to the sea, for the gallery was low and of considerable length.  Still, if necessary, he would try.  With the comforting exclamation, \"If your strength does not suffice, another way will be found,\" he took his leave, gave Barine's maid and the wounded man's body-slave the necessary directions, commanded the door-keeper to admit no one save the physician, and stepped into the open air.  A little band of Ephebi were pacing to and fro before the house.  Others had flung themselves down in an open space surrounded by shrubbery in the Paneum garden, and were drinking the choice wine which Dion's cellarer, by his orders, had brought and was pouring out for the crowd.  It was an animated scene, for the clients of the sufferer, who, after expressing their sympathy, had been dismissed by the porter, and bedizened girls had joined the youths.  There was no lack of jests and laughter, and when some pretty young mother or female slave passed by leading children, with whom the garden was a favourite playground, many a merry word was exchanged.  Gorgias waved his hands gaily to the youths, pleased with the cheerfulness with which the brave fellows transformed duty into a festival, and many raised their wine-cups, shouting a joyous \"Io\" and \"Evoe,\" to drink the health of the famous artist who not long ago had been one of themselves.  The others were led by a slender youth, the student Philotas, from Amphissa, Didymus's assistant, whom the architect, a few days before, had helped to liberate from the demons of wine.  Even while Gorgias was beckoning to him from the two-wheeled chariot, the thought entered his mind that yonder handsome youth, who had so deeply wronged Barine and Dion, would be the very person to help carry his friend through the low- roofed passage to the sea.  If Philotas was the person Gorgias believed him to be, he would deem it a special favour to make amends for his crime to those whom he had injured, and he was not mistaken; for, after the youth had taken a solemn oath not to betray the secret to any one, the architect asked him to aid in Dion's rescue.  Philotas, overflowing with joyful gratitude, protested his willingness to do so, and promised to wait at the appointed spot in the Temple of Isis at the time mentioned.     CHAPTER XIV.  While Gorgias was examining the subterranean chambers in the Temple of Isis, Charmian returned to Lochias earlier than she herself had expected. She had met her brother, whom she did not find at Kanopus, at Berenike's, and after greeting Dion on his couch of pain, she told Archibius of her anxiety.  She confided to him alone that the Queen had committed Barine's fate to Alexas, for the news might easily have led the mother of the endangered woman to some desperate venture; but even Archibius's composure, so difficult to disturb, was not proof against it.  He would have sought the Queen's presence at once--if necessary, forced his way to it; but the historian Timagenes, who had just come from Rome, was expecting him, and he had not returned to his birthplace as a private citizen, but commissioned by Octavianus to act as mediator in putting an end to the struggle which had really been decided in his favour at the battle of Actium.  The choice of this mediator was a happy one; for he had taught Cleopatra in her childhood, and was the self-same quick-witted man who had so often roused her to argument.  His share in a popular insurrection against the Roman rule had led to his being carried as a slave to the Tiber.  There he soon purchased his freedom, and attained such distinction that Octavianus entrusted this important mission to the man who was so well known in Alexandria.  Archibius was to meet him at the house of Arius, who was still suffering from the wounds inflicted by the chariot-wheels of Antyllus, and Berenike had accompanied Timagenes to her brother.  Charmian did not venture to go there; a visit to Octavianus's former teacher would have been misinterpreted, and it was repugnant to her own delicacy of feeling to hold intercourse at this time with the foe and conqueror of her royal mistress.  She therefore let her brother drive with Berenike to the injured man's; but before his departure Archibius had promised, if the worst came, to dare everything to open the eyes of the Queen, who had forbidden her, Charmian, to speak in behalf of Barine and thwart the plans of Alexas.  From the Paneum garden she was carried to the Kanopic Way and the Jewish quarter, where she had many important purchases to make for Cleopatra. It was long after noon when the litter was again borne to Lochias.  On the way she had severely felt her own powerlessness.  Without having accomplished anything herself, she was forced to wait for the success of others; and she had scarcely crossed the threshold of the palace ere fresh cares were added to those which already burdened her soul.  She understood how to read the faces of courtiers, and the door-keeper's had taught her that since her departure something momentous had occurred. She disliked to question the slaves and lower officials, so she refrained, though the interior of the palace was crowded with guards, officials of every grade, attendants, and slaves.  Many who saw her gazed at her with the timidity inspired by those over whom some disaster is im pending.  Others, whose relations were more intimate, pressed forward to enjoy the mournful satisfaction of being the first messengers of evil tidings.  But she passed swiftly on, keeping them back with grave words and gestures, until, before the door of the great anteroom thronged with Greek and Egyptian petitioners, she met Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal. Charmian stopped him and inquired what had happened.  \"Since when?\" asked the old courtier.  \"Every moment has brought some fresh tidings and all are mournful.  What terrible times, Charmian, what disasters!\"  \"No messenger had arrived when I left the Lochias,\" replied Charmian. \"Now it seems as though the old monster of a palace, accustomed to so many horrors, is holding its breath in dread.  Tell me the main thing, at least, before I meet the Queen.\"   The main thing?  Pestilence  or  famine--which shall we call the worse?\"  \"Quick, Zeno!  I am expected.\"  \"I, too, am in haste, and really there is nothing to relate over which the tongue would care to dwell.  Candidus arrived first.  Came himself straight from Actium.  The fellow is bold enough.\"  \"Is the army defeated also?\"  \"Defeated, dispersed, deserted to the foe--King Herod with his legions in the van.\"  Charmian covered her face with her hands and groaned aloud, but Zeno continued:  \"You were with her in the flight.  When Mark Antony left you, he sailed with the ships which joined him for Paraetonium.  A large body of troops on which the Queen and Mardion had fixed their hopes was encamped there. Reinforcements could easily be gained and we should once more have a fine army at our disposal.\"  \"Pinarius Scarpus, a cautious soldier, was in command; and I, too, believed--\"  \"The more you trusted him, the greater would be your error.  The shameless rascal--he owes everything to Antony--had received tidings of Actium ere the ships arrived, and had already made overtures to Octavianus when the Imperator came.  The veterans who opposed the treachery were hewn down by the wretch's orders, but the brave garrison of the city could not be won over to the monstrous crime.  It is due to these men that Mark Antony still lives and did not come to a miserable end at the hands of his own troops.  The twice-defeated general-- a courier brought the news--will arrive to-night.  Strangely enough, he will not come to Lochias, but to the little palace on the Choma.\"  \"Poor, poor Queen!\" cried Charmian; \"how did she bear all this?\"  \"In the presence of the defeated Candidus and Antony's messenger like a heroine.  But afterwards----Her raving did not last long; but the mute, despairing silence!  Ere she had fully recovered her self-command she sent us all away, and I have not seen her since.  But all the thoughts and feelings which dwell here\"--he pointed to his brow and breast--\"have left their abode and linger with her.  I totter from place to place like a soulless body.  O Charmian! what has befallen us?  Where are the days when care and trouble lay buried with the other dead--the days and nights when my brain united with that of the Queen to transform this desolate earth into the beautiful Elysian Fields, every-day life to a festival, festivals to the very air of Olympus?  What unprecedented scenes of splendour had I not devised for the celebration of the victory, the triumph--nay, even the entry into Rome!  Whole chests are filled with the sketches, programmes, drawings, and verses.  All who handle brush and chisel, compose and execute music, would have lent their aid, and--you may believe me-the result would have been something which future generations would have discussed, lauded, and extolled in song. And now--now?\"  \"Now we will double our efforts to save what is yet to be rescued!\"  \"Rescued?\" repeated the courtier in a hollow tone.  \"The Queen, too, still clings to this fine word.  When I saw her at work yesterday, it seemed as if I beheld her drawing water with the bottomless vessel of the Danaides.  True, today, when I left her, her arms had fallen--and in this attitude she now stands before me with her tearful eyes.  And besides, I can't get my nephew Dion out of my mind.  Cares--nothing but cares concerning him!  And my intentions towards him were so kind!  My will gives him my entire fortune; but now he actually wants to marry the singer, the daughter of the artist Leonax.  You have taken her under your protection, but surely your own niece, Iras, is dearer to you, so you will approve of my destroying the will if Dion insists upon his own way. He shall not have a solidus of my property if he does not give up the woman who is a thorn in the Queen's flesh.  And his"]]]
