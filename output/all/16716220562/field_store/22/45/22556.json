Just look at his coat-sleeves and the legs of his trousers. They are at least two inches too short. Any other boy would be ashamed to come to a party in such ridiculous clothes.\"  Sam looked and tittered. Luke's face flushed, for, though he did not hear the words, he guessed their tenor. But he was made to forget them when Florence came forward and greeted Linton and himself with unaffected cordiality.    CHAPTER VII  FLORENCE GRANT'S PARTY   Luke's uncomfortable consciousness of his deficiencies in dress soon passed off. He noticed the sneer on Randolph's face and heard Sam's laugh, but he cared very little for the opinion of either of them. No other in the company appeared to observe his poor dress, and he was cordially greeted by them all, with the two exceptions already named.  \"The janitor ought to know better than to intrude into the society of his superiors,\" said Randolph to Sam.  \"He seems to enjoy himself,\" said Sam.  This was half an hour after the party had commenced, when all were engaged in one of the plays popular at a country party.  \"I am going to have a party myself in a short time,\" continued Randolph, \"but I shall be more select than Florence in my invitations. I shall not invite any working boys.\"  \"Right you are, Randolph,\" said the subservient Sam. \"I hope you won't forget me.\"  \"Oh, no; I shall invite you. Of course, you don't move exactly in my circle, but, at any rate, you dress decently.\"  If Sam Noble had had proper pride he would have resented the insolent assumption of superiority in this speech, but he was content to play second fiddle to Randolph Duncan. His family, like himself, were ambitious to be on good terms with the leading families in the village, and did not mind an occasional snub.  \"Shall you invite Tom Harper?\" he asked.  He felt a little jealous of Tom, who had vied with him in flattering attentions to Randolph.  \"No, I don't think so. Tom isn't here, is he?\"  \"He received an invitation, but ever since his accident he has been troubled with severe headaches, and I suppose that keeps him away.\"  \"He isn't up to my standard,\" said Randolph, consequentially. \"He comes of a low family.\"  \"You and he have been together a good deal.\"  \"Oh, I have found him of some service, but I have paid for it.\"  Yet this was the boy who, at his own personal risk, had obtained for Randolph the prize at the skating-match. Privately, Sam thought Randolph ungrateful, but he was, nevertheless, pleased at having distanced Tom in the favor of the young aristocrat.  After an hour, spent in various amusements, one of the company took her place at the piano, and dancing began.  \"Now is your time, Luke,\" said Linton. \"Secure a partner. It is only a quadrille.\"  \"I feel a little nervous,\" said Luke. \"Perhaps I had better wait till the second dance.\"  \"Oh, nonsense! Don't be afraid.\"  Meanwhile, Randolph, with a great flourish, had invited Florence to dance.  \"Thank you,\" she answered, taking his arm.  Randolph took his place with her as head couple. Linton and Annie Comray faced them. To Randolph's amazement, Luke and Fanny Pratt took their places as one of the side couples. Randolph, who was aware that Luke had never taken lessons, remarked this with equal surprise and disgust. His lip curled as he remarked to his partner: \"Really, I didn't know that Luke Larkin danced.\"  \"Nor I,\" answered Florence.  \"I am sorry he is in our set.\"  \"Why?\" asked Florence, regarding him attentively.  \"He will probably put us out by his clownish performance.\"  \"Wouldn't it be well to wait and see whether he does or not?\" responded Florence, quietly.  Randolph shrugged his shoulders.  \"I pity his partner, at any rate,\" he said.  \"I can't join in any such conversation about one of my guests,\" said Florence, with dignity.  Here the first directions were given, and the quadrille commenced.  Luke felt a little nervous, it must be confessed, and for that reason he watched with unusual care the movements of the head couples. He was quick to learn, and ordinarily cool and self-possessed. Besides, he knew that no one was likely to criticize him except Randolph. He saw the latter regarding him with a mocking smile, and this stimulated him to unusual carefulness. The result was that he went through his part with quite as much ease and correctness as any except the most practiced dancers. Florence said nothing, but she turned with a significant smile to Randolph. The latter looked disappointed and mortified. His mean disposition would have been gratified by Luke's failure, but this was a gratification he was not to enjoy.  The dance was at length concluded, and Luke, as he led his partner to a seat, felt that he had scored a success.  \"May I have the pleasure of dancing with you next time, Florence?\" asked Randolph.  \"Thank you, but I should not think it right to slight my other guests,\" said the young lady.  Just then Luke came up and preferred the same request. He would not have done so if he had not acquitted himself well in the first quadrille.  Florence accepted with a smile.  \"I was not aware that dancing was one of your accomplishments, Luke,\" she said.  \"Nor I, till this evening,\" answered Luke. \"There stands my teacher,\" and he pointed to Linton.  \"You do credit to your teacher,\" said Florence. \"I should not have known you were such a novice.\"  Luke was pleased with this compliment, and very glad that he had been spared the mortification of breaking down before the eyes of his ill-wisher, Randolph Duncan. It is hardly necessary to say that he did equally well in the second quadrille, though he and Florence were head couple.  The next dance was the Virginia Reel. Here Florence had Linton for a partner, and Luke secured as his own partner a very good dancer. From prudence, however, he took his place at some distance from the head, and by dint of careful watching he acquitted himself as well as in the quadrilles.  \"Really, Luke, you are doing wonderfully well,\" said Linton, when the dance was over. \"I can hardly believe that you have taken but one lesson, and that from so poor a teacher as I am.\"  \"I couldn't have had a better teacher, Lin,\" said Luke. \"I owe my success to you.\"  \"Didn't you say Luke couldn't dance?\" asked Sam Noble of Randolph, later in the evening.  \"He can't,\" answered Randolph, irritably.  \"He gets along very well, I am sure. He dances as well as I do.\"  \"That isn't saying much,\" answered Randolph, with a sneer. He could not help sneering even at his friends, and this was one reason why no one was really attached to him.  Sam walked away offended.  The party broke up at half-past ten. It was an early hour, but late enough considering the youth of the participants. Luke accompanied home one of the girls who had no brother present, and then turned toward his own home.  He had nearly reached it, when a tall figure, moving from the roadside, put a hand on his shoulder.  \"You are Luke Larkin?\" said the stranger, in questioning tone.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Is the tin box safe?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"That is all--for the present,\" and the stranger walked quickly away.  \"Who can he be,\" thought Luke, in wonder, \"and why should he have trusted a complete stranger--and a boy?\"  Evidently there was some mystery about the matter. Had the stranger come honestly by the box, or was Luke aiding and abetting a thief? He could not tell.    CHAPTER VIII  MISS SPRAGUE DISCOVERS A SECRET   About this time it became known to one person in the village that the Larkins had in their possession a tin box, contents unknown.  This is the way it happened:  Among the best-known village residents was Miss Melinda Sprague, a maiden lady, who took a profound interest in the affairs of her neighbors. She seldom went beyond the limits of Groveton, which was her world. She had learned the business of dressmaking, and often did work at home for her customers. She was of a curious and prying disposition, and nothing delighted her more than to acquire the knowledge of a secret.  One day--a few days after Florence Grant's party--Mrs. Larkin was in her own chamber. She had the trunk open, having occasion to take something from it, when, with a light step, Miss Sprague entered the room. The widow, who was on her knees before the trunk, turning, recognized the intruder, not without displeasure.  \"I hope you'll excuse my coming in so unceremoniously, Mrs. Larkin,\" said Melinda, effusively. \"I knocked, but you didn't hear it, being upstairs, and I took the liberty, being as we were so well acquainted, to come upstairs in search of you.\"  \"Yes, certainly,\" answered Mrs. Larkin, but her tone was constrained.  She quickly shut the lid of the trunk. There was only one thing among its contents which she was anxious to hide, but that Miss Melinda's sharp eyes had already discovered. Unfortunately, the tin box was at one side, in plain sight.  \"What on earth does Mrs. Larkin do with a tin box?\" she asked herself, with eager curiosity. \"Can she have property that people don't know of? I always thought she was left poor.\"  Melinda asked no questions. The sudden closing of the trunk showed her that the widow would not be inclined to answer any questions.  \"I won't let her think I saw anything,\" she said to herself. \"Perhaps she'll get anxious and refer to it.\"  \"We will go downstairs, Melinda,\" said Mrs. Larkin. \"It will be more comfortable.\"  \"If you have anything to do up here, I beg you won't mind me,\" said the spinster.  \"No, I have nothing that won't wait.\"  So the two went down into the sitting-room.  \"And how is Luke?\" asked Miss Sprague, in a tone of friendly interest.  \"Very well, thank you.\"  \"Luke was always a great favorite of mine,\" continued the spinster. \"Such a manly boy as he is!\"  \"He is a great help to me,\" said Mrs. Larkin.  \"No doubt he is. He takes care of the schoolhouse, doesn'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5417"],["title","Struggling Upward, or Luke Larkin's Luck (#5)"],["body","he?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How much pay does he get?\"  \"A dollar a week.\"  \"I hope he will be able to keep the position.\"  \"What do you mean, Melinda?\" asked the widow, not without anxiety.  \"You know Doctor Snodgrass has resigned on the school committee, and Squire Duncan has been elected in his place.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Mrs. Flanagan went to him yesterday to ask to have her son Tim appointed janitor in place of Luke, and I heard that she received considerable encouragement from the squire.\"  \"Do they find any fault with Luke?\" asked Mrs. Larkin, jealously.  \"No, not as I've heard; but Mrs. Flanagan said Luke had had it for a year, and now some one else ought to have the chance.\"  \"Are you quite sure of this, Melinda?\"  Miss Sprague, though over forty, was generally called by her first name, not as a tribute to her youth, but to the fact of her being still unmarried.  \"Yes, I am; I had it from Mrs. Flanagan herself.\"  \"I don't think Tim would do as well as Luke. He has never been able to keep a place yet.\"  \"Just so; but, of course, his mother thinks him a polygon.\" Probably Miss Sprague meant a paragon--she was not very careful in her speech, but Mrs. Larkin did not smile at her mistake. She was too much troubled at the news she had just heard. A dollar a week may seem a ridiculous trifle to some of my readers, but, where the entire income of the family was so small, it was a matter of some consequence.  \"I don't think Luke has heard anything of this,\" said the widow. \"He has not mentioned it to me.\"  \"Perhaps there won't be any change, after all,\" said Melinda. \"I am sure Tim Flanagan wouldn't do near as well as Luke.\"  Miss Melinda was not entirely sincere. She had said to Mrs. Flanagan that she quite agreed with her that Luke had been janitor long enough, and hoped Tim would get the place. She was in the habit of siding with the person she chanced to be talking with at the moment, and this was pretty well understood.  Luke, however, had heard of this threatened removal. For this, it may be said, Randolph was partly responsible. Just after Mrs. Flanagan's call upon the squire to solicit his official influence, Prince Duncan mentioned the matter to his son.  \"How long has Luke Larkin been janitor at the schoolhouse?\" he asked.  \"About a year. Why do you ask?\"  \"Does he attend to the duties pretty well?\"  \"I suppose so. He's just fit to make fires and sweep the floor,\" answered Randolph, his lip curling.  \"Mrs. Flanagan has been here to ask me to appoint her son Tim in Luke's place.\"  \"You'd better do it, pa,\" said Randolph, quickly.  \"Why? You say Luke is well fitted for the position.\"  \"Oh, anybody could do as well, but Luke puts on airs. He feels too big for his position.\"  \"I suppose Mrs. Larkin needs the money.\"  \"So does Mrs. Flanagan,\" said Randolph.  \"What sort of a boy is Tim? I have heard that he is lazy.\"  \"Oh, I guess he'll do. Of course, I am not well acquainted with a boy like him,\" said the young aristocrat. \"But I'm quite disgusted with Luke. He was at Florence Grant's party the other evening, and was cheeky enough to ask her to dance with him.\"  \"Did she do so?\"  \"Yes; I suppose it was out of pity. He ought to have known better than to attend a party with such a suit. His coat and pantaloons were both too small for him, but he flourished around as if he were fashionably dressed.\"  Squire Duncan made no reply to his son's comments, but he felt disposed, for reasons of his own, to appoint Tim Flanagan. He was hoping to be nominated for representative at the next election, and thought the appointment might influence the Irish vote in his favor.  \"Shall you appoint Tim, pa?\" asked Randolph.  \"I think it probable. It seems only right to give him a chance. Rotation in office is a principle of which I approve.\"  \"That's good!\" thought Randolph, with a smile of gratification. \"It isn't a very important place, but Luke will be sorry to lose it. The first time I see him I will give him a hint of it.\"  Randolph met Luke about an hour later in the village street. He did not often stop to speak with our hero, but this time he had an object in doing so.    CHAPTER IX  LUKE LOSES HIS POSITION   \"Luke Larkin!\"  Luke turned, on hearing his name called, and was rather surprised to see Randolph hastening toward him.  \"How are you, Randolph?\" he said politely.  \"Where are you going?\" asked Randolph, not heeding the inquiry.  \"To the schoolhouse, to sweep out.\"  \"How long have you been janitor?\" asked Randolph, abruptly.  \"About a year,\" Luke answered, in surprise.  \"That's a good while.\"  Luke was puzzled. Why should Randolph feel such an interest, all at once, in his humble office?  \"I suppose you know that my father is now on the school committee?\" Randolph continued.  \"Yes; I heard so.\"  \"He thinks of appointing Tim Flanagan janitor in your place.\"  Luke's face showed his surprise and concern. The loss of his modest income would, as he knew, be severely felt by his mother and himself. The worst of it was, there seemed no chance in Groveton of making it up in any other way.  \"Did your father tell you this?\" he asked, after a pause.  \"Yes; he just told me,\" answered Randolph, complacently.  \"Why does he think of removing me? Are there any complaints of the way I perform my duties?\"  \"Really, my good fellow,\" said Randolph, languidly, \"I can't enlighten you on that point. You've held the office a good while, you know.\"  \"You are very kind to tell me--this bad news,\" said Luke, pointedly.  \"Oh, don't mention it. Good morning. Were you fatigued after your violent exercise at Florence Grant's party?\"  \"No. Were you?\"  \"I didn't take any,\" said Randolph, haughtily. \"I danced--I didn't jump round.\"  \"Thank you for the compliment. Is there anything more you wish to say to me?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then good morning.\"  When Luke was left alone he felt serious. How was he going to make up the dollar a week of which he was to be deprived? The more he considered the matter the further he was from thinking anything. He was not quite sure whether the news was reliable, or merely invented by Randolph to tease and annoy him. Upon this point, however, he was soon made certain. The next day, as he was attending to his duties in the schoolhouse, Tim Flanagan entered.  \"Here's a note for you, Luke,\" he said.  Luke opened the note and found it brief but significant. It ran thus:  \"LUKE LARKIN: I have appointed the bearer, Timothy Flanagan, janitor in your place. You will give him the key of the schoolhouse, and he will at once assume your duties.  \"PRINCE DUNCAN.\"  \"Well, Tim,\" said Luke, calmly, \"it appears that you are going to take my place.\"  \"Yes, Luke, but I don't care much about it. My mother went to the squire and got me the job. The pay's a dollar a week, isn't it?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That isn't enough.\"  \"It isn't very much, but there are not many ways of earning money here in Groveton.\"  \"What do you have to do?\"  \"Make the fire every morning and sweep out twice a week. Then there's dusting, splitting up kindlings, and so on.\"  \"I don't think I'll like it. I ain't good at makin' fires.\"  \"Squire Duncan writes you are to begin at once.\"  \"Shure, I'm afraid I won't succeed.\"  \"I'll tell you what, Tim. I'll help you along till you've got used to the duties. After a while they'll get easy for you.\"  \"Will you now? You're a good feller, Luke. I thought you would be mad at losin' the job.\"  \"I am not mad, but I am sorry. I needed the money, but no doubt you do, also. I have no grudge against you.\"  Luke had just started in his work. He explained to Tim how to do it, and remained with him till it was done.  \"I'll come again to-morrow, Tim,\" he said. \"I will get you well started, for I want to make it easy for you.\"  Tim was by no means a model boy, but he was warm-hearted, and he was touched by Luke's generous treatment.  \"I say, Luke,\" he exclaimed, \"I don't want to take your job. Say the word, and I'll tell mother and the squire I don't want it.\"  \"No, Tim, it's your duty to help your mother. Take it and do your best.\"  On his way home Luke chanced to meet the squire, walking in his usual dignified manner toward the bank, of which he was president.  \"Squire Duncan,\" he said, walking up to him in a manly way, \"I would like to speak a word to you.\"  \"Say on, young man.\"  \"Tim Flanagan handed me a note from you this morning ordering me to turn over my duties as janitor to him.\"  \"Very well?\"  \"I have done so, but I wish to ask you if I have been removed on account of any complaints that my work was not well done?\"  \"I have heard no complaints,\" answered the squire. \"I appointed Timothy in your place because I approved of rotation in office. It won't do any good for you to make a fuss about it.\"  \"I don't intend to make a fuss, Squire Duncan,\" said Luke, proudly. \"I merely wished to know if there were any charges against me.\"  \"There are none.\"  \"Then I am satisfied. Good morning, sir.\"  \"Stay, young man. Is Timothy at the schoolhouse?\"  \"Yes, sir. I gave him some instruction about the work, and promised to go over to-morrow to help him.\"  \"Very well.\"  Squire Duncan was rather relieved to find that Luke did not propose to make any fuss. His motive, as has already been stated, was a political one. He wished to ingratiate himself with Irish voters and obtain an election as representative; not that he cared so much for this office, except as a stepping-stone to something higher.  Luke turned his steps homeward. He dreaded communicating the news to his mother, for he knew that it would depress her, as it had him. However, it must be known sooner or later, and he must not shrink from telling her.  \"Mother,\" he said, as he entered the room where she was sewing, \"I have lost my job as janitor.\"  \"I expected you would, Luke,\" said his mother, soberly.  \"Who told you?\" asked Luke, in surprise.  \"Melinda Sprague was here yesterday and told me Tim Flanagan was to have it.\"  \"Miss Sprague seems to know everything that is going on.\"  \"Yes, she usually hears everything.
