There must be something not right with one of the children.\"  \"What eyes you have!\"  exclaimed Petrus.  \"Dim, grey eyes,\" said Dorothea, \"and not even particularly keen.  But when anything concerns you and the children I could see it in the dark. You are dissatisfied with Polykarp; yesterday, before he set out for Raithu, you looked at him so--so--what shall I say?  I can quite imagine what it is all about, but I believe you are giving yourself groundless anxiety.  He is young, and so lovely a woman as Sirona--\"  Up to this point Petrus had listened to his wife in silence.  Now he clasped his hands, and interrupted her, \"Things certainly are not going on quite right--but I ought to be used to it.  What I meant to have confided to you in a quiet hour, you tell me as if you knew all about it!\"  \"And why not?\"  asked Dorothea.  \"When you graft a scion on to a tree, and they have grown well together, the grafted branch feels the bite of the saw that divides the stock, or the blessing of the spring that feeds the roots, just as if the pain or the boon were its own.  And you are the tree and I am the graft, and the magic power of marriage has made us one. Your pulses are my pulses, your thoughts have become mine, and so I always know before you tell me what it is that stirs your soul.\"  Dorothea's kind eyes moistened as she spoke, and Petrus warmly clasped her hands in his as he said, \"And if the gnarled old trunk bears from time to time some sweet fruit, he may thank the graft for it.  I cannot believe that the anchorites up yonder are peculiarly pleasing to the Lord because they live in solitude.  Man comes to his perfect humanity only through his wife and child, and he who has them not, can never learn the most glorious heights and the darkest depths of life and feeling.  If a man may stake his whole existence and powers for anything, surely it is for his own house.\"  \"And you have honestly done so for ours!\"  cried Dorothea.  \"For ours,\" repeated Petrus, giving the words the strongest accent of his deep voice.  Two are stronger than one, and it is long since we ceased to say 'I' in discussing any question concerning the house or the children; and both have been touched by to-day's events.\"  \"The senate will not support you in constructing the road?\"  \"No, the bishop gave the casting-vote.  I need not tell you how we stand towards each other, and I will not blame him; for he is a just man, but in many things we can never meet half-way.  You know that he was in his youth a soldier, and his very piety is rough--I might almost say warlike. If we had yielded to his views, and if our head man Obedianus had not supported me, we should not have had a single picture in the church, and it would have looked like a barn rather than a house of prayer.  We never have understood each other, and since I opposed his wish of making Polykarp a priest, and sent the boy to learn of the sculptor Thalassius --for even as a child he drew better than many masters in these wretched days that produce no great artists--since then, I say, he speaks of me as if I were a heathen--\"  \"And yet he esteems you highly, that I know,\" interrupted Dame Dorothea.  \"I fully return his good opinion,\" replied Petrus, \"and it is no ordinary matter that estranges.  He thinks that he only holds the true faith, and ought to fight for it; he calls all artistic work a heathen abomination; he never felt the purifying influence of the beautiful, and regards all pictures and statues as tending to idolatry.  Still he allows himself to admire Polykarp's figures of angels and the Good Shepherd, but the lions put the old warrior in a rage.  'Accursed idols and works of the devil,' are what he calls them.\"  \"But there were lions even in the temple of Solomon,\" cried Dorothea.  \"I urged that, and also that in the schools of the catechists, and in the educational history of animals which we possess and teach from, the Saviour himself is compared to a lion, and that Mark, the evangelist, who brought the doctrine of the gospel to Alexandria, is represented with a lion.  But he withstood me more and more violently, saying that Polykarp's works were to adorn no sacred place, but the Caesareum, and that to him is nothing but a heathen edifice, and the noble works of the Greeks that are preserved there he calls revolting images by which Satan ensnares the souls of Christian men.  The other senators can understand his hard words, but they cannot follow mine; and so they vote with him, and my motion to construct the roadway was thrown over, because it did not become a Christian assembly to promote idolatry, and to smooth a way for the devil.\"  \"I can see that you must have answered them sharply!\"  \"Indeed I believe so,\" answered Petrus, looking down.  \"Many painful things were no doubt said, and it was I that suffered for them. Agapitus, who was looking at the deacons' reports, was especially dissatisfied with the account that I laid before them; they blamed us severely because you gave away as much bread to heathen households as to Christians.  It is no doubt true, but--\"  But,\" cried Dorothea eagerly, \"hunger is just as painful to the unbaptized, and their Christian neighbors do not help them, and yet they too are our flesh and blood.  I should ill fulfil my office if I were to let them starve, because the highest comfort is lacking to them.\"  \"And yet,\" said Petrus, \"the council decided that, for the future, you must apply at the most a fourth part of the grain allotted to their use. You need not fear for them; for the future some of our own produce may go to them out of what we have hitherto sold.  You need not withdraw even a loaf from any one of your proteges, but certainly may now be laid by the plans for the road.  Indeed there is no hurry for its completion, for Polykarp will now hardly be able to go on with his lions here among us. Poor fellow! with what delight he formed the clay models, and how wonderfully he succeeded in reproducing the air and aspect of the majestic beasts.  It is as if he were inspired by the spirit of the old Athenian masters.  We must now consider whether in Alexandria--\"  \"Rather let us endeavor,\" interrupted Dorothea, \"to induce him at once to put aside his models, and to execute other more pious works.  Agapitus has keen eyes, and the heathen work is only too dear to the lad's heart.\"  The senator's brow grew dark at the last words, and he said, not without some excitement, \"Everything that the heathen do is not to be condemned. Polykarp must be kept busy, constantly and earnestly occupied, for he has set his eyes where they should not be set.  Sirona is the wife of another, and even in sport no man should try to win his neighbor's wife. Do you think, the Gaulish woman is capable of forgetting her duty?\"  Dorothea hesitated, and after some reflection answered, \"She is a beautiful and vain child--a perfect child; I mean in nature, and not in years, although she certainly might be the grandchild of her strange husband, for whom she feels neither love nor respect, nor, indeed, anything but utter aversion.  I know not what, but something frightful must have come between them even in Rome, and I have given up all attempts to guide her heart back to him.  In everything else she is soft and yielding, and often, when she is playing with the children, I cannot imagine where she finds her reckless gaiety.  I wish she were a Christian, for she is very dear to me, why should I deny it?  It is impossible to be sad when she is by, and she is devoted to me, and dreads my blame, and is always striving to win my approbation.  Certainly she tries to please every one, even the children; but, so far as I can see, not more Polykarp than any one else, although he is such a fine young man.  No, certainly not.\"  \"And yet the boy gazes at her,\" said Petrus, \"and Phoebicius has noticed it; he met me yesterday when I came home, and, in his sour, polite manner, requested me to advise my son, when he wished to offer a rose, not to throw it into his window, as he was not fond of flowers, and preferred to gather them himself for his wife.\"  The senator's wife turned pale, and then exclaimed shortly and positively, \"We do not need a lodger, and much as I should miss his wife, the best plan will be for you to request him to find another dwelling.\"  \"Say no more, wife,\" Petrus said, sternly, and interrupting her with a wave of his hand.  \"Shall we make Sirona pay, for it because our son has committed a folly for her sake?  You yourself said, that her intercourse with the children, and her respect for you, preserve her from evil, and now shall we show her the door?  By no means.  The Gauls may remain in my house so long as nothing occurs that compels me to send them out of it. My father was a Greek, but through my mother I have Amalekite blood in my veins, and I should dishonor myself, if I drove from my threshold any, with whom I had once broken bread under my roof.  Polykarp shall be warned, and shall learn what he owes to us, to himself, and to the laws of God.  I know how to value his noble gifts, and I am his friend, but I am also his master, and I will find means of preventing my son from introducing the light conduct of the capital beneath his father's roof.\"  The last words were spoken with weight and decision, like the blows of a hammer, and stern resolve sparkled in the senator's eyes.  Nevertheless, his wife went fearlessly up to him, and said, laying her hand on his arm, \"It is, indeed, well that a man can keep his eyes set on what is just, when we women should follow the hasty impulse of our heart.  Even in wrestling, men only fight with lawful and recognized means, while fighting women use their teeth and nails.  You men understand better how to prevent injustice than we do, and that you have once more proved to me, but, in carrying justice out, you are not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5495"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 02 (#8)"],["body","superiors.  The Gauls may remain in our house, and do you take Polykarp severely to task, but in the first instance as his friend.  Or would it not be better if you left it to me?  He was so happy in thinking of the competition of his lions, and in having to work for the great building in the capital, and now it is all over.  I wish you had already broken that to him; but love stories are women's affairs, and you know how good the boy is to me.  A mother's word sometimes has more effect than a father's blow, and it is in life as it is in war; the light forces of archers go first into the field, and the heavily armed division stays in the background to support them; then, if the enemy will not yield, it comes forward and decides the battle.  First let me speak to the lad.  It may be that he threw the rose into Sirona's window only in sport, for she plays with his brothers and sisters as if she herself were one of them.  I will question him; for if it is so, it would be neither just nor prudent to blame him.  Some caution is needed even in giving a warning; for many a one, who would never have thought of stealing, has become a thief through false suspicion.  A young heart that is beginning to love, is like a wild boy who always would rather take the road he is warned to avoid, and when I was a girl, I myself first discovered how much I liked you, when the Senator Aman's wife--who wanted you for her own daughter--advised me to be on my guard with you.  A man who has made such good use of his time, among all the temptations of the Greek Sodom, as Polykarp, and who has won such high praise from all his teachers and masters, cannot have been much injured by the light manners of the Alexandrians.  It is in a man's early years that he takes the bent which he follows throughout his later life, and that he had done before he left our house.  Nay--even if I did not know what a good fellow Polykarp is--I need only look at you to say, 'A child that was brought up by this father, could never turn out a bad man.'\"  Petrus sadly shrugged his shoulders, as though he regarded his wife's flattering words as mere idle folly, and yet he smiled, as he asked, \"Whose school of rhetoric did you go to?  So be it then; speak to the lad when he returns from Raithu.  How high the moon is already; come to rest --Antonius is to place the altar in the early dawn, and I wish to be present.\"     CHAPTER IX.  Miriam's ears had not betrayed her.  While she was detained at supper, Hermas had opened the courtyard-gate; he came to bring the senator a noble young buck, that he had killed a few hours before, as a thank- offering for the medicine to which his father owed his recovery.  It would no doubt have been soon enough the next morning, but he could find no rest up on the mountain, and did not--and indeed did not care to-- conceal from himself the fact, that the wish to give expression to his gratitude attracted him down into the oasis far less than the hope of seeing Sirona, and of hearing a word from her lips.  Since their first meeting he had seen her several times, and had even been into her house, when she had given him the wine for his father, and when he had taken back the empty flask.  Once, as she was filling the bottle which he held, out of the large jar, her white fingers had touched his, and her enquiry whether he were afraid of her, or  if not, why his hands which looked so strong should tremble so violently, dwelt still in his mind.  The nearer he approached Petrus's house the more vehemently his heart beat; he stood still in front of the gate-way, to take breath, and to collect himself a little, for he felt that, agitated as he was, he would find it difficult to utter any coherent words.  At last he laid his hand on the latch and entered the yard.  The watch- dogs already knew him, and only barked once as he stepped over the threshold.  He brought a gift in his hand, and he wanted to take nothing away, and yet he appeared to himself just like a thief as he looked round, first at the main building lighted up by the moon, and then at the Gaul's dwelling-house, which, veiled in darkness, stood up as a vague silhouette, and threw a broad dark shadow on the granite flags of the pavement, which was trodden to shining smoothness.  There was not a soul to be seen, and the reek of the roast sheep told him that Petrus and his household were assembled at supper.  \"I might come inopportunely on the feasters,\" said he to himself, as he threw the buck over from his left to his right shoulder, and looked up at Sirona's window, which he knew only too well.  It was not lighted up, but a whiter and paler something appeared within its dark stone frame, and this something, attracted his gaze with an irresistible spell; it moved, and Sirona's greyhound set up a sharp barking.  It was she--it must be she!  Her form rose before his fancy in all its brilliant beauty, and the idea flashed through his mind that she must be alone, for he had met her husband and the old slave woman among the worshippers of Mithras on their way to the mountain.  The pious youth, who so lately had punished his flesh with the scourge to banish seductive dream-figures, had in these few days become quite another man.  He would not leave the mountain, for his father's sake, but he was quite determined no longer to avoid the way of the world; nay, rather to seek it.  He had abandoned the care of his father to the kindly Paulus, and had wandered about among the rocks; there he had practised throwing the discus, he had hunted the wild goats and beasts of prey, and from time to time--but always with some timidity--he had gone down into the oasis to wander round the senator's house, and catch a glimpse of Sirona.  Now that he knew that she was alone, he was irresistibly drawn to her. What he desired of her, he himself could not have said; and nothing was clear to his mind beyond the wish to touch her fingers once more.  Whether this were a sin or not, was all the same to him; the most harmless play was called a sin, and every thought of the world for which he longed, and he was fully resolved to take the sin upon himself, if only he might attain his end.  Sin after all was nothing but a phantom terror with which they frighten children, and the worthy Petrus had assured him that he might be a man capable of great deeds.  With a feeling that he was venturing on an unheard of act he went towards Sirona's window, and she at once recognized him as he stood in the moonlight.  \"Hermas!\"  he heard her say softly.  He was seized with such violent terror that he stood as if spellbound, the goat slipped from his shoulders, and he felt as if his heart had ceased to beat.  And again the sweet woman's voice called, \"Hermas, is it you?  What brings you to us at such a late hour?\"  He stammered an incoherent answer, and \"I do not understand; come a little nearer.\"  Involuntarily he stepped forward into the shadow of the house and close up to her window.  She wore a white robe with wide, open sleeves, and her arms shone in the dim light as white as her garment. The greyhound barked again; she quieted it, and then asked Hermas how his father was, and whether he needed some more wine.  He replied that she was very kind, angelically kind, but that the sick man was recovering fast, and that she had already given him far too much.  Neither of them said anything that might not have been heard by everybody, and yet they whispered as if they were speaking of some forbidden thing.  \"Wait a moment,\" said Sirona, and she disappeared within the room, she soon reappeared, and said solid and sadly, \"I would ask you to come into the house but Phoebicius has locked the door.  I am quite alone, hold the flask so that I may fill it through the open window.\"  With these words she leaned over with the large jar--she was strong, but the wine-jar seemed to her heavier than on other occasions, and she said with a sigh, \"The amphora is too heavy for me.\"  He reached up to help her; again his fingers met hers, and again he felt the ecstatic thrill which had haunted his memory day and night ever since he first had felt it.  At this instant there was a sudden noise in the house opposite; the slaves were coming out from supper.  Sirona knew what was happening; she started and cried out, pointing to the senator's door, \"For all the gods' sake! they are coming out, and if they see you here I am lost!\"  Hermas looked hastily round the court, and listened to the increasing noise in the other house, then, perceiving that there was no possible escape from the senator's people, who were close upon him, he cried out to Sirona in a commanding tone, \"Stand back,\" and flung himself up through the window into the Gaul's apartment.  At the same moment the door opposite opened, and the slaves streamed out into the yard.  In front of them all was Miriam, who looked all round the wide space- expectant; seeking something, and disappointed.  He was not there, and yet she had heard him come in; and the gate had not opened and closed a second time, of that she was perfectly certain.  Some of the slaves went to the stables, others went outside the gate into the street to enjoy the coolness of the evening; they sat in groups on the ground, looking up at the stars, chattering or singing.  Only the shepherdess remained in the court-yard seeking him on all sides, as if she were hunting for some lost trinket.  She searched even behind the millstones, and in the dark sheds in which the stone-workers' tools were kept.  Then she stood still a moment and clenched her hands; with a few light bounds she sprang into the shadow of the Gaul's house.  Just in front of Sirona's window lay the steinbock; she hastily touched it with her slender naked toes, but quickly withdrew her foot with a shudder, for it had touched the beast's fresh wound, wet with its blood.  She rapidly drew the conclusion that: he had killed it, and had thrown it down here, and that he"]]]
