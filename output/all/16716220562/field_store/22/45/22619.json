And he saw the doorway darkened by a lowly, bending figure, who, with folded arms, glided into the room and sank down silently by the side of the sick girl.  The physicians and the old people moved as if to rise; but she signed to them without opening her lips, and with moist, expressive eyes, to keep their places; she looked long and lovingly in the face of the wounded girl, stroked her white arm, and turning to the old woman softly whispered to her  \"How pretty she is!\"  The paraschites' wife nodded assent, and the girl smiled and moved her lips as though she had caught the words and wished to speak.  Bent-Anat took a rose from her hair and laid it on her bosom.  The paraschites, who had not taken his hands from the feet of the sick child, but who had followed every movement of the princess, now whispered, \"May Hathor requite thee, who gave thee thy beauty.\"  The princess turned to him and said, \"Forgive the sorrow, I have caused you.\"  The old man stood up, letting the feet of the sick girl fall, and asked in a clear loud voice:  \"Art thou Bent-Anat?\"  \"Yes, I am,\" replied the princess, bowing her head low, and in so gentle a voice, that it seemed as though she were ashamed of her proud name.  The eyes of the old man flashed.  Then he said softly but decisively:  \"Leave my hut then, it will defile thee.\"  \"Not till you have forgiven me for that which I did unintentionally.\"  \"Unintentionally!  I believe thee,\" replied the paraschites.  \"The hoofs of thy horse became unclean when they trod on this white breast.  Look here--\" and he lifted the cloth from the girl's bosom, and showed her the deep red wound, \"Look here--here is the first rose you laid on my grandchild's bosom, and the second--there it goes.\"  The paraschites raised his arm to fling the flower through the door of his hut.  But Pentaur had approached him, and with a grasp of iron held the old man's hand.  \"Stay,\" he cried in an eager tone, moderated however for the sake of the sick girl.  \"The third rose, which this noble hand has offered you, your sick heart and silly head have not even perceived.  And yet you must know it if only from your need, your longing for it.  The fair blossom of pure benevolence is laid on your child's heart, and at your very feet, by this proud princess.  Not with gold, but with humility.  And whoever the daughter of Rameses approaches as her equal, bows before her, even if he were the first prince in the Land of Egypt.  Indeed, the Gods shall not forget this deed of Bent-Anat.  And you--forgive, if you desire to be forgiven that guilt, which you bear as an inheritance from your fathers, and for your own sins.\"  The paraschites bowed his head at these words, and when he raised it the anger had vanished from his well-cut features.  He rubbed his wrist, which had been squeezed by Pentaur's iron fingers, and said in a tone which betrayed all the bitterness of his feelings:  \"Thy hand is hard, Priest, and thy words hit like the strokes of a hammer.  This fair lady is good and loving, and I know; that she did not drive her horse intentionally over this poor girl, who is my grandchild and not my daughter.  If she were thy wife or the wife of the leech there, or the child of the poor woman yonder, who supports life by collecting the feet and feathers of the fowls that are slaughtered for sacrifice, I would not only forgive her, but console her for having made herself like to me; fate would have made her a murderess without any fault of her own, just as it stamped me as unclean while I was still at my mother's breast.  Aye--I would comfort her; and yet I am not very sensitive.  Ye holy three of Thebes!--[The triad of Thebes: Anion, Muth and Chunsu.]--how should I be?  Great and small get out of my way that I may not touch them, and every day when I have done what it is my business to do they throw stones at me.       [The paraschites, with an Ethiopian knife, cuts the flesh of the      corpse as deeply as the law requires: but instantly takes to flight,      while the relatives of the deceased pursue him with stones, and      curses, as if they wished to throw the blame on him.]  \"The fulfilment of duty--which brings a living to other men, which makes their happiness, and at the same time earns them honor, brings me every day fresh disgrace and painful sores.  But I complain to no man, and must forgive--forgive--forgive, till at last all that men do to me seems quite natural and unavoidable, and I take it all like the scorching of the sun in summer, and the dust that the west wind blows into my face.  It does not make me happy, but what can I do?  I forgive all--\"  The voice of the paraschites had softened, and Bent-Anat, who looked down on him with emotion, interrupted him, exclaiming with deep feeling:  \"And so you will forgive me?--poor man!\"  The old man looked steadily, not at her, but at Pentaur, while he replied: \"Poor man! aye, truly, poor man.  You have driven me out of the world in which you live, and so I made a world for myself in this hut. I do not belong to you, and if I forget it, you drive me out as an intruder--nay as a wolf, who breaks into your fold; but you belong just as little to me, only when you play the wolf and fall upon me, I must bear it!\"  \"The princess came to your hut as a suppliant, and with the wish of doing you some good,\" said Pentaur.  \"May the avenging Gods reckon it to her, when they visit on her the crimes of her father against me!  Perhaps it may bring me to prison, but it must come out.  Seven sons were mine, and Rameses took them all from me and sent them to death; the child of the youngest, this girl, the light of my eyes, his daughter has brought to her death.  Three of my boys the king left to die of thirst by the Tenat,       [Literally the \"cutting\" which, under Seti I., the father of      Rameses, was the first Suez Canal; a representation of it is found      on the northern outer wall of the temple of Karnak.  It followed      nearly the same direction as the Fresh-water canal of Lesseps, and      fertilized the land of Goshen.]  which is to join the Nile to the Red Sea, three were killed by the Ethiopians, and the last, the star of my hopes, by this time is eaten by the hyaenas of the north.\"  At these words the old woman, in whose lap the head of the girl rested, broke out into a loud cry, in which she was joined by all the other women.  The sufferer started up frightened, and opened her eyes.  \"For whom are you wailing?\"  she asked feebly.  \"For your poor father,\" said the old woman.  The girl smiled like a child who detects some well-meant deceit, and said:  \"Was not my father here, with you?  He is here, in Thebes, and looked at me, and kissed me, and said that he is bringing home plunder, and that a good time is coming for you.  The gold ring that he gave me I was fastening into my dress, when the chariot passed over me.  I was just pulling the knots, when all grew black before my eyes, and I saw and heard nothing more.  Undo it, grandmother, the ring is for you; I meant to bring it to you.  You must buy a beast for sacrifice with it, and wine for grandfather, and eye salve       [The Egyptian mestem, that is stibium or antimony, which was      introduced into Egypt by the Asiatics at a very early period and      universally used.]  for yourself, and sticks of mastic,       [At the present day the Egyptian women are fond of chewing them, on      account of their pleasant taste.  The ancient Egyptians used various      pills.  Receipts for such things are found in the Ebers Papyrus.]  which you have so long lead to do without.\"  The paraschites seemed to drink these words from the mouth of his grandchild.  Again he lifted his hand in prayer, again Pentaur observed that his glance met that of his wife, and a large, warm tear fell from his old eyes on to his callous hand.  Then he sank down, for he thought the sick child was deluded by a dream.  But there were the knots in her dress.  With a trembling hand he untied them, and a gold ring rolled out on the floor.  Bent-Anat picked it up, and gave it to the paraschites.  \"I came here in a lucky hour,\" she said, \"for you have recovered your son and your child will live.\"  \"She will live,\" repeated the surgeon, who had remained a silent witness of all that had occurred.  \"She will stay with us,\" murmured the old man, and then said, as he approached the princess on his knees, and looked up at her beseechingly with tearful eyes:  \"Pardon me as I pardon thee; and if a pious wish may not turn to a curse from the lips of the unclean, let me bless thee.\"  \"I thank you,\" said Bent-Anat, towards whom the old man raised his hand in blessing.  Then she turned to Nebsecht, and ordered him to take anxious care of the sick girl; she bent over her, kissed her forehead, laid her gold bracelet by her side, and signing to Pentaur left the hut with him.     CHAPTER VI.  During the occurrence we have described, the king's pioneer and the young wife of Mena were obliged to wait for the princess.  The sun stood in the meridian, when Bent-Anat had gone into the hovel of the paraschites.  The bare limestone rocks on each side of the valley and the sandy soil between, shone with a vivid whiteness that hurt the eyes; not a hand's breadth of shade was anywhere to be seen, and the fan-beaters of the two, who were waiting there, had, by command of the princess, staid behind with the chariot and litters.  For a time they stood silently near each other, then the fair Nefert said, wearily closing her almond-shaped eyes:  \"How long Bent-Anat stays in the but of the unclean!  I am perishing here.  What shall we do?\"  \"Stay!\"  said Paaker, turning his back on the lady; and mounting a block of stone by the side of the gorge, he cast a practised glance all round, and returned to Nefert: \"I have found a shady spot,\" he said, \"out there.\"  Mena's wife followed with her eyes the indication of his hand, and shook her head.  The gold"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 02 (#4)"],["body"," on her head-dress rattled gently as she did so, and a cold shiver passed over her slim body in spite of the midday heat.  \"Sechet is raging in the sky,\" said Paaker.       [A goddess with the head of a lioness or a cat, over which the Sun-      disk is usually found.  She was the daughter of Ra, and in the form      of the Uraeus on her father's crown personified the murderous heat      of the star of day.  She incites man to the hot and wild passion of      love, and as a cat or lioness tears burning wounds in the limbs of      the guilty in the nether world; drunkenness and pleasure are her      gifts  She was also named Bast and Astarte after her sister-divinity      among the Phoenicians.]  \"Let us avail ourselves of the shady spot, small though it be.  At this hour of the day many are struck with sickness.\"  \"I know it,\" said Nefert, covering her neck with her hand.  Then she went towards two blocks of stone which leaned against each other, and between them afforded the spot of shade, not many feet wide, which Paaker had pointed out as a shelter from the sun.  Paaker preceded her, and rolled a flat piece of limestone, inlaid by nature with nodules of flint, under the stone pavilion, crushed a few scorpions which had taken refuge there, spread his head-cloth over the hard seat, and said, \"Here you are sheltered.\"  Nefert sank down on the stone and watched the Mohar, who slowly and silently paced backwards and forward in front of her.  This incessant to and fro of her companion at last became unendurable to her sensitive and irritated nerves, and suddenly raising her head from her hand, on which she had rested it, she exclaimed  \"Pray stand still.\"  The pioneer obeyed instantly, and looked, as he stood with his back to her, towards the hovel of the paraschites.  After a short time Nefert said, \"Say something to me!\"  The Mohar turned his full face towards her, and she was frightened at the wild fire that glowed in the glance with which he gazed at her.  Nefert's eyes fell, and Paaker, saying:  \"I would rather remain silent,\" recommenced his walk, till Nefert called to him again and said,  \"I know you are angry with me; but I was but a child when I was betrothed to you.  I liked you too, and when in our games your mother called me your little wife, I was really glad, and used to think how fine it would be when I might call all your possessions mine, the house you would have so splendidly restored for me after your father's death, the noble gardens, the fine horses in their stables, and all the male and female slaves!\"  Paaker laughed, but the laugh sounded so forced and scornful that it cut Nefert to the heart, and she went on, as if begging for indulgence:  \"It was said that you were angry with us; and now you will take my words as if I had cared only for your wealth; but I said, I liked you.  Do you no longer remember how I cried with you over your tales of the bad boys in the school; and over your father's severity?  Then my uncle died;-- then you went to Asia.\"  And you,\" interrupted Paaker, hardly and drily, \"you broke your bethrothal vows, and became the wife of the charioteer Mena.  I know it all; of what use is talking?\"  \"Because it grieves me that you should be angry, and your good mother avoid our house.  If only you could know what it is when love seizes one, and one can no longer even think alone, but only near, and with, and in the very arms of another; when one's beating heart throbs in one's very temples, and even in one's dreams one sees nothing--but one only.\"  \"And do I not know it?\"  cried Paaker, placing himself close before her with his arms crossed.  \"Do I not know it? and you it was who taught me to know it.  When I thought of you, not blood, but burning fire, coursed in my veins, and now you have filled them with poison; and here in this breast, in which your image dwelt, as lovely as that of Hathor in her holy of holies, all is like that sea in Syria which is called the Dead Sea, in which every thing that tries to live presently dies and perishes.\"  Paaker's eyes rolled as he spoke, and his voice sounded hoarsely as he went on.  \"But Mena was near to the king--nearer than I, and your mother--\"  \"My mother!\"--Nefert interrupted the angry Mohar.  \"My mother did not choose my husband.  I saw him driving the chariot, and to me he resembled the Sun God, and he observed me, and looked at me, and his glance pierced deep into my heart like a spear; and when, at the festival of the king's birthday, he spoke to me, it was just as if Hathor had thrown round me a web of sweet, sounding sunbeams.  And it was the same with Mena; he himself has told me so since I have been his wife.  For your sake my mother rejected his suit, but I grew pale and dull with longing for him, and he lost his bright spirit, and was so melancholy that the king remarked it, and asked what weighed on his heart--for Rameses loves him as his own son.  Then Mena confessed to the Pharaoh that it was love that dimmed his eye and weakened his strong hand; and then the king himself courted me for his faithful servant, and my mother gave way, and we were made man and wife, and all the joys of the justified in the fields of Aalu       [The fields of the blest, which were opened to glorified souls.  In      the Book of the Dead it is shown that in them men linger, and sow      and reap by cool waters.]  are shallow and feeble by the side of the bliss which we two have known-- not like mortal men, but like the celestial gods.\"  Up to this point Nefert had fixed her large eyes on the sky, like a glorified soul; but now her gaze fell, and she said softly--  \"But the Cheta       [An Aramaean race, according to Schrader's excellent judgment.  At      the time of our story the peoples of western Asia had allied      themselves to them.]  disturbed our happiness, for the king took Mena with him to the war. Fifteen times did the moon, rise upon our happiness, and then--\"  \"And then the Gods heard my prayer, and accepted my offerings,\" said Paaker, with a trembling voice, \"and tore the robber of my joys from you, and scorched your heart and his with desire.  Do you think you can tell me anything I do not know?  Once again for fifteen days was Mena yours, and now he has not returned again from the war which is raging hotly in Asia.\"  \"But he will return,\" cried the young wife.  \"Or possibly not,\" laughed Paaker.  \"The Cheta, carry sharp weapons, and there are many vultures in Lebanon, who perhaps at this hour are tearing his flesh as he tore my heart.\"  Nefert rose at these words, her sensitive spirit bruised as with stones thrown by a brutal hand, and attempted to leave her shady refuge to follow the princess into the house of the parascllites; but her feet refused to bear her, and she sank back trembling on her stone seat.  She tried to find words, but her tongue was powerless.  Her powers of resistance forsook her in her unutterable and soul-felt distress--heart- wrung, forsaken and provoked.  A variety of painful sensations raised a hot vehement storm in her bosom, which checked her breath, and at last found relief in a passionate and convulsive weeping that shook her whole body.  She saw nothing more, she heard nothing more, she only shed tears and felt herself miserable.  Paaker stood over her in silence.  There are trees in the tropics, on which white blossoms hang close by the withered fruit, there are days when the pale moon shows itself near the clear bright sun;--and it is given to the soul of man to feel love and hatred, both at the same time, and to direct both to the same end.  Nefert's tears fell as dew, her sobs as manna on the soul of Paaker, which hungered and thirsted for revenge.  Her pain was joy to him, and yet the sight of her beauty filled him with passion, his gaze lingered spell-bound on her graceful form; he would have given all the bliss of heaven once, only once, to hold her in his arms--once, only once, to hear a word of love from her lips.  After some minutes Nefert's tears grew less violent.  With a weary, almost indifferent gaze she looked at the Mohar, still standing before her, and said in a soft tone of entreaty:  'My tongue is parched, fetch me a little water.\"  \"The princess may come out at any moment,\" replied Paaker.  \"But I am fainting,\" said Nefert, and began again to cry gently.  Paaker shrugged his shoulders, and went farther into the valley, which he knew as well as his father's house; for in it was the tomb of his mother's ancestors, in which, as a boy, he had put up prayers at every full and new moon, and laid gifts on the altar.  The hut of the paraschites was prohibited to him, but he knew that scarcely a hundred paces from the spot where Nefert was sitting, lived an old woman of evil repute, in whose hole in the rock he could not fail to find a drink of water.  He hastened forward, half intoxicated with had seen and felt within the last few minutes.  The door, which at night closed the cave against the intrusions of the plunder-seeking jackals, was wide open, and the old woman sat outside under a ragged piece of brown sail-cloth, fastened at one end to the rock and at the other to two posts of rough wood.  She was sorting a heap of dark and light-colored roots, which lay in her lap.  Near her was a wheel, which turned in a high wooden fork.  A wryneck made fast to it by a little chain, and by springing from spoke to spoke kept it in continual motion.--[From Theocritus' idyl: The Sorceress.]--A large black cat crouched beside her, and smelt at some ravens' and owls' heads, from which the eyes had not long since been extracted.  Two sparrow-hawks sat huddled up over the door of the cave, out of which came the sharp odor of burning juniper-berries; this was intended to render the various emanations rising from the different strange substances, which were collected and preserved there, innocuous.  As Paaker approached the cavern the old woman called out to some one within:  \"Is the wax cooking?"]]]
