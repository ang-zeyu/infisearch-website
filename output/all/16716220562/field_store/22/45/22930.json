You are revenged; for it was for your sake--understand that--for your sake alone, that my beloved and dying father withdrew the blessings he had heaped on my remorseful head, and in wrath that was only too just at the recreant who had desecrated the judgment-seat of his ancestors, turned that blessing to a curse.\"  Paula turned pale as she read.  This then was what Katharina had meant. This was what had so changed his appearance, and perhaps, too, his whole inward being.  And this, this bore the stamp of truth, this could not be a lie--it was for her sake that a father's curse had blighted his only son!  How had it all happened?  Had Philippus failed to observe it, or had he held his peace out of respect for the secrets of another?--Poor man, poor young man!  She must see him, must speak to him.  She could not have a moment's ease till she knew how it was that her uncle, a tender father.--But she must go on, quickly to the end:  \"I come to you only as what I am: a heart-broken man, too young to give myself over for lost, and at the same time determined to make use of all that remains to me of the steadfast will, the talents, and the self- respect of my forefathers to render me worthy of them, and I implore you to grant me a brief interview.  Not a word, not a look shall betray the passion within and which threatens to destroy me.  \"You must on no account fail to read what follows, since it is of no small real importance even to you.  In the first place restitution must be made to you of all of your inheritance which the deceased was able to rescue and to add to by his fatherly stewardship.  In these agitated times it will be a matter of some difficulty to invest this capital safely and to good advantage.  Consider: just as the Arabs drove out the Byzantines, the Byzantines might drive them out again in their turn. The Persians, though stricken to the earth, the Avars, or some other people whose very name is as yet unknown to history, may succeed our present rulers, who, only ten years since, were regarded as a mere handful of unsettled camel-drivers, caravan-leaders, and poverty-stricken desert-tribes.  The safety of your fortune would be less difficult to provide for if, as was formerly the case here, we could entrust it to the merchants of Alexandria.  But one great house after another is being ruined there, and all security is at an end.  As to hiding or burying your possessions, as most Egyptians do in these hard times, it is impossible, for the same reason as prevents our depositing it on interest in the state land-register.  You must be able to get it at the shortest notice; since you might at some time wish to quit Egypt in haste with all your possessions.  \"These are matters with which a woman cannot be familiar.  I would therefore propose that you should leave the arrangement of them to us men; to Philippus, the physician, Rufinus, your host--who is, I am assured, an honest man--and to our experienced and trustworthy treasurer Nilus, whom you know as an incorruptible judge.  \"I propose that the business should be settled tomorrow in the house of Rufinus.  You can be present or not, as you please.  If we men agree in our ideas I beg you--I beseech you to grant me an interview apart.  It will last but a few minutes, and the only subject of discussion will be a matter--an exchange by which you will recover something you value and have lost, and grant me I hope, if not your esteem, at any rate a word of forgiveness.  I need it sorely, believe me, Paula; it is as indispensable to me as the breath of life, if I am to succeed in the work I have begun on myself.  If you have prevailed on yourself to read through this letter, simply answer 'Yes' by my messenger, to relieve me from torturing uncertainty.  If you do not--which God forefend for both our sakes, Nilus shall this very day carry to you all that belongs to you.  But, if you have read these lines, I will make my appearance to-morrow, at two hours after noon, with Nilus to explain to the others the arrangement of which I have spoken.  God be with you and infuse some ruth into your proud and noble soul!\"  Paula drew a deep breath as the hand holding this momentous epistle dropped by her side; she stood for some time by the window, lost in grave meditation.  Then calling Pulcheria, she begged her to tend her patient, too, for a short time.  The girl looked up at her with rapt admiration in her clear eyes, and asked sympathetically why she was so pale; Paula kissed her lips and eyes, and saying affectionately: \"Good, happy child!\" she retired to her own room on the opposite side of the house.  There she once more read through the letter.  Oh yes; this was Orion as she had known him after his return till the evening of that never-to-be-forgotten water-party.  He was, indeed, a poet; nature herself had made it so easy to him to seduce unguarded souls into a belief in him!  And yet no!  This letter was honestly meant. Philippus knew men well; Orion really had a heart, a warm heart.  Not the most reckless of criminals could mock at the curse hurled at him by a beloved father in his last moments.  And, as she once more read the sentence in which he told her that it was his crime as an unjust judge towards her that had turned the dying man's blessing to a curse, she shuddered and reflected that their relative attitude was now reversed, and that he had suffered more and worse through her than she had through him.  His pale face, as she had seen it in the Necropolis, came back vividly to her mind, and if he could have stood before her at this moment she would have flown to him, have offered him a compassionate hand, and have assured him that the woes she had brought upon him filled her with the deepest and sincerest pity.  That morning she had asked the Masdakite whether he had besought Heaven to grant him a speedy recovery, and the man replied that Persians never prayed for any particular blessing, but only for \"that which was good;\" for that none but the Omnipotent knew what was good for mortals.  How wise!  For in this instance might not the most terrible blow that could fall on a son--his father's curse--prove a blessing?  It was undoubtedly that curse which had led him to look into his soul and to start on this new path.  She saw him treading it, she longed to believe in his conversion--and she did believe in it.  In this letter he spoke of his love; he even asked her hand.  Only yesterday this would have roused her wrath; to-day she could forgive him; for she could forgive anything to this unhappy soul--to the man on whom she had brought such deep anguish. Her heart could now beat high in the hope of seeing him again; nay, it even seemed to her that the youth, whose return had been hailed with such welcome and who had so powerfully attracted her, had only now grown and ripened to full and perfect manhood through his sin, his penitence, and his suffering.  And how noble a task it would be to assist him in seeking the right way, and in becoming what he aspired to be!  The prudent care he had given to her worldly welfare merited her gratitude.  What could he mean by the \"exchange\" he proposed?  The \"great love\" of which he had spoken to Katharina was legible in every line of his letter, and any woman can forgive any man--were he a sinner, and a scarecrow into the bargain--for his audacity in loving her.  Oh! that he might but set his heart on her--for hers, it was vain to deny it, was strongly drawn to him.  Still she would not call it Love that stirred within her; it could only be the holy impulse to point out to him the highest goal of life and smooth the path for him.  The pale horseman who had clutched her in her dream should not drag her away; no, she would joyfully lift him up to the highest pinnacle attainable by a brave and noble man.  So her thoughts ran, and her cheeks flushed as, with swift decision, she opened her trunk, took out papyrus, writing implements and a seal, and seated herself at a little desk which Rufinus had placed for her in the window, to write her answer.  At this a sudden fervent longing for Orion came over her.  She made a great effort to shake it off; still, she felt that in writing to him it was impossible that she should find the right words, and as she replaced the papyrus in the chest and looked at the seal a strange thing happened to her; for the device on her father's well-known ring: a star above two crossed swords--perchance the star of Orion--caught her eye, with the motto in Greek: \"The immortal gods have set sweat before virtue,\" meaning that the man who aims at being virtuous must grudge neither sweat nor toil.  She closed her trunk with a pleased smile, for the motto round the star was, she felt, of good augury.  At the same time she resolved to speak to Orion, taking these words, which her forefathers had adopted from old Hesiod, as her text.  She hastened down stairs, crossed the garden, passing by Rufinus, his wife and the physician, awoke the secretary who had long since dropped asleep, and enjoined him to say: \"Yes\" to his master, as he expected.  However, before the messenger had mounted his mule, she begged him to wait yet a few minutes and returned to the two men; for she had forgotten in her eagerness to speak to them of Orion's plans.  They were both willing to meet him at the hour proposed and, while Philippus went to tell the messenger that they would expect his master on the next day, the old man looked at Paula with undisguised satisfaction and said:  \"We were fearing lest the news from the governor's house should have spoilt your happy mood, but, thank God, you look as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5521"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 05 (#7)"],["body","you had just come from a refreshing bath.--What do you say, Joanna?  Twenty years ago such an inmate here would have made you jealous?  Or was there never a place for such evil passions in your dove-like soul?\"  \"Nonsense!\"  laughed the matron.  \"How can I tell how many fair beings you have gazed after, wanderer that you are in all the wide world far away?\"  \"Well, old woman, but as sure as man is the standard of all things, nowhere that I have carried my staff, have I met with a goddess like this!\"  \"I certainly have not either, living here like a snail in its shell,\" said Dame Joanna, fixing her bright eyes on Paula with fervent admiration.     CHAPTER XXI.  That evening Rufinus was sitting in the garden with his wife and daughter and their friend Philippus.  Paula, too, was there, and from time to time she stroked Pulcheria's silky golden hair, for the girl had seated herself at her feet, leaning her head against Paula's knee.  The moon was full, and it was so light out of doors that they could see each other plainly, so Rufinus' proposition that they should remain to watch an eclipse which was to take place an hour before midnight found all the more ready acceptance because the air was pleasant.  The men had been discussing the expected phenomenon, lamenting that the Church should still lend itself to the superstitions of the populace by regarding it as of evil omen, and organizing a penitential procession for the occasion to implore God to avert all ill.  Rufinus declared that it was blasphemy against the Almighty to interpret events happening in the course of eternal law and calculable beforehand, as a threatening sign from Him; as though man's deserts had any connection with the courses of the sun and moon.  The Bishop and all the priests of the province were to head the procession, and thus a simple natural phenomenon was forced in the minds of the people into a significance it did not possess.  \"And if the little comet which my old foster father discovered last week continues to increase,\" added the physician, \"so that its tail spreads over a portion of the sky, the panic will reach its highest pitch; I can see already that they will behave like mad creatures.\"  \"But a comet really does portend war, drought, plague, and famine,\" said Pulcheria, with full conviction; and Paula added:  \"So I have always believed.\"  \"But very wrongly,\" replied the leech.  \"There are a thousand reasons to the contrary; and it is a crime to confirm the mob in such a superstition.  It fills them with grief and alarms; and, would you believe it--such anguish of mind, especially when the Nile is so low and there is more sickness than usual, gives rise to numberless forms of disease?  We shall have our hands full, Rufinus.\"  \"I am yours to command,\" replied the old man.  \"But at the same time, if the tailed wanderer must do some mischief, I would rather it should break folks' arms and legs than turn their brains.\"  \"What a wish!\"  exclaimed  Paula.  \"But  you often say things--and I see things about you too--which seem to me extraordinary.  Yesterday you promised. . . .\"  \"To explain to you why I gather about me so many of God's creatures who have to struggle under the burden of life as cripples, or with injured limbs.\"  \"Just so,\" replied Paula.  \"Nothing can be more truly merciful than to render life bearable to such hapless beings. . . .\"  \"But still, you think,\" interrupted the eager old man, \"that this noble motive alone would hardly account for the old oddity's riding his hobby so hard.--Well, you are right.  From my earliest youth the structure of the bones in man and beast has captivated me exceedingly; and just as collectors of horns, when once they have a complete series of every variety of stag, roe, and gazelle, set to work with fresh zeal to find deformed or monstrous growths, so I have found pleasure in studying every kind of malformation and injury in the bones of men and beasts.\"  \"And to remedy them,\" added Philippus.  \"It has been his passion from childhood.  \"And the passion has grown upon me since I broke my own hip bone and know what it means,\" the old man went on.  \"With the help of my fellow-student there, from a mere dilettante I became a practised surgeon; and, what is more, I am one of those who serve Esculapius at my own expense.  However, there are accessory reasons for which I have chosen such strange companions: deformed slaves are cheap and besides that, certain investigations afford me inestimable and peculiar satisfaction. But this cannot interest a young girl.\"  \"Indeed it does!\"  cried Paula.  \"So far as I have understood Philippus when he explains some details of natural history. . . .\"  \"Stay,\" laughed Rufinus,  \"our friend will take good care not to explain this.  He regards it as folly, and all he will admit is that no surgeon or student could wish for better, more willing, or more amusing house- mates than my cripples.\"  \"They are grateful to you,\" cried Paula.  \"Grateful?\"  asked the old man.  \"That is true sometimes, no doubt; still, gratitude is a tribute on which no wise man ever reckons.  Now I have told you enough; for the sake of Philippus we will let the rest pass.\"  \"No, no,\" said Paula putting up entreating hands, and Rufinus answered gaily:  \"Who can refuse you anything?  I will  cut it short, but you must pay good heed.--Well then Man is the standard of all things.  Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes, I often hear you say so.  Things you mean are only what they seem to us.\"  \"To us, you say, because we--you and I and the rest of us here--are sound in body and mind.  And we must regard all things--being God's handiwork-- as by nature sound and normal.  Thus we are justified in requiring that man, who gives the standard for them shall, first and foremost, himself be sound and normal.  Can a carpenter measure straight planks properly with a crooked or sloping rod?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Then you will understand how I came to ask myself: 'Do sickly, crippled, and deformed men measure things by a different standard to that of sound men?  And might it not be a useful task to investigate how their estimates differ from ours?'\"  \"And have your researches among your cripples led to any results?\"  \"To many important ones,\" the old man declared; but Philippus interrupted him with a loud: \"Oho!\"  adding that his friend was in too great a hurry to deduce laws from individual cases.  Many of his observations were, no doubt, of considerable interest...  Here Rufinus broke in with some vehemence, and the discussion would have become a dispute if Paula had not intervened by requesting her zealous host to give her the results, at any rate, of his studies.  \"I find,\" said Rufinus very confidently, as he stroked down his long beard, \"that they are not merely shrewd because their faculties are early sharpened to make up by mental qualifications for what they lack in physical advantages; they are also witty, like AEesop the fabulist and Besa the Egyptian god, who, as I have been told by our old friend Horus, from whom we derive all our Egyptian lore, presided among those heathen over festivity, jesting, and wit, and also over the toilet of women. This shows the subtle observation of the ancients; for the hunchback whose body is bent, applies a crooked standard to things in general. His keen insight often enables him to measure life as the majority of men do, that is by a straight rule; but in some happy moments when he yields to natural impulse he makes the straight crooked and the crooked straight; and this gives rise to wit, which only consists in looking at things obliquely and--setting them askew as it were.  You have only to talk to my hump-backed gardener Gibbus, or listen to what he says.  When he is sitting with the rest of our people in an evening, they all laugh as soon as he opens his mouth.--And why?  Because his conformation makes him utter nothing but paradoxes.--You know what they are?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"And you, Pul?\"  \"No, Father.\"  \"You are too straight-nay, and so is your simple soul, to know what the thing is!  Well, listen then: It would be a paradox, for instance, if I were to say to the Bishop as he marches past in procession: 'You are godless out of sheer piety;' or if I were to say to Paula, by way of excuse for all the flattery which I and your mother offered her just now: 'Our incense was nauseous for very sweetness.'--These paradoxes, when examined, are truths in a crooked form, and so they best suit the deformed.  Do you understand?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Paula.  \"And you, Pul?\"  \"I am not quite sure.  I should be better pleased to be simply told:  \"We ought not to have made such flattering speeches; they may vex a young girl.\"  \"Very good, my straightforward child,\" laughed her father.  \"But look, there is the man!  Here, good Gibbus--come here!--Now, just consider: supposing you had flattered some one so grossly that you had offended him instead of pleasing him: How would you explain the state of affairs in telling me of it?\"  The gardener, a short, square man, with a huge hump but a clever face and good features, reflected a minute and then replied: \"I wanted to make an ass smell at some roses and I put thistles under his nose.\"  \"Capital!\"  cried Paula; and as Gibbus turned away, laughing to himself, the physician said:  \"One might almost envy the man his hump.  But yet, fair Paula, I think we have some straight-limbed folks who can make use of such crooked phrases, too, when occasion serves.\"  But Rufinus spoke before Paula could reply, referring her to his Essay on the deformed in soul and body; and then he went on vehemently:  \"I call you all to witness, does not Baste, the lame woman, restrict her views to the lower aspect of things, to the surface of the earth indeed? She has one leg much shorter than the other, and it is only with much pains that we have contrived that it should carry her.  To limp along at all she is forced always to look down at the ground, and"]]]
