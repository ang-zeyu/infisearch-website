He saw the sunny smile that brightened her beloved, ever- beautiful face, and then--then his own name reached his ears from the lips to which he owed the greatest bliss love had ever offered.  At last, as if intoxicated by the tones of her voice, which seemed to him more musical than the songs of the Muses; half smiling at the jest which, even in the most serious earnest, he could not abandon; half moved to the depths of his soul by the power of his newly awakening happiness after such sore sorrow, he pointed to the gigantic bouquet, which three slaves had lifted down from the elephant and were bearing to the Queen. Cleopatra, too, was overwhelmed with emotion.  This floral gift imitated, on an immense scale, the little bouquet which the famous young general had taken from her father's hand before the gate of the garden of Epicurus to present to her as his first gift.  That had also been composed of red roses, surrounded by white ones.  Instead of palm fronds, it had been encircled only by fern leaves.  This was one of the beautiful offerings which Antony's gracious nature so well understood how to choose.  The bouquet was a symbol of the unprecedented generosity natural to this large-minded man.  No magic goblet had compelled him to approach her thus and with such homage.  Nothing had constrained him, save his overflowing heart, his constant, fadeless love.  As if restored to youth, transported by some magic spell to the happy days of early girlhood, she forgot her royal dignity and the hundreds of eyes which rested upon him as if spell-bound; and, obedient to an irresistible impulse of the heart, she sank upon the broad, heaving breast of the kneeling hero.  Laughing joyously in the clear, silvery tones which are usually heard only in youth, he clasped her in his strong arms, raised her slender figure in its floating royal mantle from the ground, kissed her lips and eyes, held her aloft in the soaring attitude of the Goddess of Victory, as if to display his happiness to the eyes of all, and at last placed her carefully on her feet again like some treasured jewel.  Then, turning to the children, who were waiting at their mother's side, he lifted first little Alexander, then the twins, to kiss them; and, while holding Helios and Selene in his arms, as if the joy of seeing them again had banished their weight, the shouts which had arisen when the Queen sank on his breast again burst forth.  The ancient walls of the Lochias palace had never heard such acclamations.  They passed from lip to lip, from hundreds to hundreds and, though those more distant did not know the cause, they joined in the shouts.  Along the whole vast stretch from the Lochias to the Choma the cheers rang out like a single, heart-stirring, inseparable cry, echoing across the harbour, the ships lying at anchor, the towering masts, to the cliff amid the sea where Barine was nursing her new-made husband.     CHAPTER XX.  The property of the freedman Pyrrhus was a flat rock in the northern part of the harbour, scarcely larger than the garden of Didymus at the Corner of the Muses, a desolate spot where neither tree nor blade of grass grew. It was called the Serpent Island, though the inhabitants had long since rid it of these dangerous guests, which lived in great numbers in the neighbouring cliffs.  Not even the poorest crops would grow in soil so hostile to life, and those who chose it for a home were compelled to bring even the drinking-water from the continent.  This desert, around which hovered gulls, sea-swallows, and sea-eagles, had been for several weeks the abode of the fugitives, Dion and Barine. They still occupied the two rooms which had been assigned to them on their arrival.  During the day the sun beat fiercely down upon the yellow chalky rock.  There was no shade save in the house and at the foot of a towering cliff in the southern part of the island, the fishermen's watch- tower.  There were no works of human hands save a little Temple of Poseidon, an altar of Isis, the large house owned by Pyrrhus, solidly constructed by Alexandrian masons, and a smaller one for the freedman's married sons and their families.  A long wooden frame, on which nets were strung to dry, rose on the shore.  Near it, towards the north, in the open sea, was the anchorage of the larger sea-going ships and the various skiffs and boats of the fisher folk.  Dionikos, Pyrrhus's youngest son, who was still unmarried, built new boats and repaired the old ones.  His two strong, taciturn brothers, with their wives and children, his father Pyrrhus, his wife and their youngest child, a daughter, Dione, a few dogs, cats, and chickens, composed the population of the Serpent Island.  Such were the surroundings of the newly wedded pair, who had been reared in the capital.  At first many things were strange to them, but they accommodated themselves to circumstances with a good grace, and both had admitted to each other, long before, that life had never been so equable and peaceful.  During the first week Dion's wound and fever still harassed him, but the prediction of Pyrrhus that the pure, fresh sea-air would benefit the sufferer had been fulfilled, and the monotonous days had passed swiftly enough to the young bride in caring for the invalid.  The wife of Pyrrhus--\"mother,\" as they all called her--had proved to be a skilful nurse, and her daughters-in-law and young Dione were faithful and nimble assistants.  During the time of anxiety and nursing, Barine had formed a warm friendship for them.  If the taciturn men avoided using a single unnecessary word, the women were all the more ready to gossip; and it was a pleasure to talk to pretty Dione, who had grown up on the island and was eager to hear about the outside world.  Dion had long since left his couch and the house, and each day looked happier, more content with himself and his surroundings.  At first his feverish visions had shown him his dead mother, pointing anxiously at his new-made wife, as if to warn him against her.  During his convalescence he remembered them and they conjured up the doubt whether Barine could endure the solitude of this desolate cliff, whether she would not lose the bright serenity of soul whose charm constantly increased.  Would it be any marvel if she should pine with longing in this solitude, and even suffer physically from their severe privations?  The perception that love now supplied the place of all which she had lost pleased him, but he forbade himself to expect that this condition of affairs could be lasting.  Nothing save exaggerated self-conceit would induce the hope.  But he must have undervalued his own power of attraction--or Barine's love--for with each passing week the cheerful serenity of her disposition gained fresh steadfastness and charm.  He, too, had the same experience; it was long since he had felt so vigorous, untrammelled, and free from care.  His sole regret was the impossibility of sharing the political life of the city at this critical period; and at times he felt some little anxiety concerning the fate and management of his property, though, even if his estates were confiscated, he would still retain a competence which he had left in the hands of a trustworthy money-changer.  Barine shared everything that concerned him, even these moods, and this led him to tell her about the affairs of the city and the state, in which she had formerly taken little interest, his property in Alexandria and the provinces.  With what glad appreciation she listened, when she went out with him from the northern anchorage on the open sea, or sat during long winter evenings making nets, an art which she had learned from Dione!  Her lute had been sent to her from the city, and what pleasure her singing afforded her husband and herself; how joyously their hosts, old and young, listened to the melody!  A few book-rolls had also come, and Dion enjoyed discussing their contents with Barine.  He himself read very little, for he was rarely indoors during the day.  The fourth week after his arrival he was able to aid, with arms whose muscles had been steeled in the pakestra, the men in their fishing, and Dionikos in his boat-building.  The close, constant, uninterrupted companionship of the married pair revealed to each unexpected treasures in the other, which, perhaps, might have remained forever concealed in city life.  Here each was everything to the other, and this undisturbed mutual life soon inspired that blissful consciousness of inseparable union which usually appears only after years, as the fairest fruit of a marriage founded on love.  Doubtless there were hours when Barine longed to see her mother and others who were dear to her, but the letters which arrived from time to time prevented this yearning from becoming a source of actual pain.  Prudence required them to restrict their intercourse with the city.  But, whenever Pyrrhus went to market, letters reached the island delivered at the fish auction in the harbour by Anukis, Charmian's Nubian maid, to the old freedman, who had become her close friend.  So the time came when Dion could say without self-deception that Barine was content in this solitude, and that his love and companionship supplied the place of the exciting, changeful life of the capital. Though letters came from her mother, sister, or Charmian, her grandfather, Gorgias, or Archibius, not one transformed the wish to leave her desolate hiding-place into actual homesickness, but each brought fresh subjects for conversation, and among them many which, by arousing the interest of both, united them more firmly.  The second month of their flight a letter arrived from Archibius, in which he informed them that they might soon form plans for their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5480"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 08 (#3)"],["body","urn, for Alexas, the Syrian, had proved a malicious traitor.  He had not performed the commission entrusted to him of winning Herod to Antony's cause, but treacherously deserted his patron and remained with the King of the Jews.  When, with unprecedented shamelessness, he sought Octavianus to sell the secrets of his Egyptian benefactor, he was arrested and executed in his own home, Laodicea.  Now, their friend continued, Cleopatra's eyes as well as her husband's were opened to the true character of Barine's most virulent accuser.  The influence of Philostratus, too, was of course destroyed by his brother's infamous deed.  Yet they must wait a little longer; for Caesarion had joined the Ephebi, and Antyllus had been invested with the toga virilis. They could now undertake many things independently, and Caesarion often made remarks which showed that he would not cease to lay plots for Barine.  Dion feared nothing from the royal boy on his own account, but for his wife's sake he dared not disregard his friend's warning.  This was hard; for though he still felt happy on the island, he longed to install the woman he loved in his own house, and every impulse of his nature urged him to be present at the meetings of the Council in these fateful times. Therefore he was more than ready to risk returning to the city, but Barine entreated him so earnestly not to exchange the secure happiness they enjoyed here for a greater one, behind which might lurk the heaviest misfortune, that he yielded.  Another letter from Charmian soon proved the absolute necessity of continuing to exercise caution.  Even from the island they could perceive that everything known as festal pleasure was rife in Alexandria, and bore along in its mad revelry the court and the citizens.  When the wind blew from the south, it brought single notes of inspiring music or indistinct sounds of the wildest popular rejoicing.  The fisherman's daughter, Dione, often called them to the strand to admire the galleys adorned with fabulous splendour, garlanded with flowers, and echoing with the music of lutes and the melody of songs. Sails of purple embroidered silk bore the vessels over the smooth tide. Once the watchers even distinguished, upon a barge richly adorned with gilded carving, young female slaves who, with floating hair and transparent sea-green robes, handled, in the guise of Nereids, light sandal-wood oars with golden blades.  Often the breeze bore to the island the perfumes which surrounded the galleys, and on calm nights the magnificent ships, surrounded by the magical illumination of many-hued lamps, swept across the mirror-like surface of the waves, Among the voyagers were gods, goddesses, and heroes who, standing or reclining in beautiful groups, represented scenes from the myths and history.  On the deck of the Queen's superb vessel guests crowned with wreaths lay on purple couches, under garlands of flowers, eating choice viands and draining golden wine-cups.  On other nights the illumination of the shore of the Bruchium rendered it as bright as day.  The huge dome of the Serapeum on the Rhakotis, covered with lamps, towered above the flat roofs of the city like the starry firmament of a smaller world which had descended to earth.  Every temple and palace was transformed into a giant candelabrum, and the rows of lamps on the quay stretched like tendrils of light from the dazzlingly illuminated marble Temple of Poseidon to the palace at Lochias, steeped in radiance.  When Pyrrhus or one of his sons returned from market they described the festivals and shows, banquets, races, and endless pleasure excursions arranged by the court, which made the citizens fairly hold their breath. It was a prosperous time for the fishermen; the Queen's cooks took all their wares and paid a liberal price.  January had come, when another letter arrived from Charmian.  Dion and Barine had watched in vain for any unusual events on Cleopatra's birth day, but on Antony's, a few days later, there was plenty of music and shouting, and in the evening an unusually magnificent illumination.  Two days after, this letter was delivered to Pyrrhus by his dusky friend Anukis.  Her inquiry whether he thought it prudent to convey visitors to his guests was answered in the negative, for since Octavianus had been in Asia, the harbour swarmed with the boats of spies, and a single act of imprudence might bring ruin.  Charmian's letter, too, was even better calculated to curb Dion's increasing desire to return home than the fisherman's warning.  True, the beginning contained good news of Barine's relatives, and then informed Dion that his uncle, the Keeper of the Seal, was fairly revelling in bliss.  His inventive gifts were taxed more than ever. Every day brought a festival, every night magnificent banquets.  One spectacle, excursion, or hunting party followed another.  In the theatres, the Odeum, the Hippodrome, no more brilliant performances, races, naval battles, gladiatorial struggles, and combats between beasts had been given, even before Actium.  Dion himself had formerly attended the entertainments of those who belonged to the court circle, the society of \"Inimitable Livers.\"  It had been revived again, but Antony called them the \"Comrades of Death.\"  This was significant.  Every one knows that the end is drawing near, and imitates the Pharaoh to whom the oracle promised six years of life, and who convicted it of falsehood and made them twelve by carousing during the night also.  The Queen's meeting with her husband, which she had previously reported, had been magnificent.  \"At that time,\" she wrote, \"we hoped that a more noble life would begin, and Mark Antony, awakened and elevated by his rekindled love, would regain his former heroic power; but we were mistaken; Cleopatra, it is true, toiled unceasingly, but her lover with his enormous bunch of roses gave the signal for the maddest revelry which the imagination of the wildest devotee of pleasure could conceive.  The performances of the Inimitable Livers were far surpassed by those of the \"Comrades of Death.\"  \"Antony is at their head, and he, whose giant frame resists even the most unprecedented demands, succeeds in stupefying himself and forgetting the impending ruin.  When he comes to us after a night of revelry his eyes sparkle as brightly, his deep voice has as clear a ring, as at the beginning of the banquet.  The Queen is his goddess; and who could remain unmoved when the giant bows obediently to the nod of his delicate sovereign, and devises and offers the most unprecedented things to win a smile from her lips?  The changeful, impetuous wooing of youth lies far behind him, but his homage, which the Ephebi of today would perhaps term antiquated, has always seemed to me as if a mountain were bending before a star.  The stranger who sees her in his company believes her a happy woman.  Amid the fabulous radiance of the festal array, when all who surround her admire, worship, and strew flowers in her path, one might believe that the old sunny days had returned; but when we are alone, how rarely I see her smile!  Then she plans for the tomb which, under Gorgias's direction, is rapidly rising, and considers with him the best method of rendering it an inaccessible place of retreat.  \"She decided everything, down to the carving on the stone sarcophagi.  In addition, there are to be rooms and chambers in the lower story for the reception of her treasures.  Beneath them she has had corridors made for the pitch and straw which, if the worst should come, are to be lighted. She will then give to the flames the gold and silver, gems and jewels, ebony and ivory, the costly spices--in short, all her valuables.  The pearls alone are worth many kingdoms.  Who can blame her if she prefers to destroy them rather than leave them for the foe\"  \"The garden in which you grew up, Barine, is now the scene of the happy, busy life led by Alexander and the twins.  There, under my brother's guidance, they frolic, build, and dig.  Cleopatra goes to it whenever she longs for repose after the pursuit of pleasures which have lost their zest.  \"When, the  day  before  yesterday, Antony, crowned with ivy as the new Dionysus, drove up the Street of the King in the golden chariot drawn by tamed lions, to bring her, the new Isis, from the Lochias in a lotus flower made of silver and white paste, drawn by four snow-white steeds, she pointed to the glittering train and said: 'Between the quiet of the philosopher's garden, where I began my life and still feel most at ease, and the grave, where nothing disturbs my last repose, stretches the Street of the King, with this deafening tumult, this empty splendour.  It is mine.'  \"O child, it was very different in former days!  She loved Mark Antony with passionate ardour.  He was the first man in the world, and yet he bowed before the supremacy of her will.  The longing of the awakening heart, the burning ambition which already kindled the soul of the child, had alike found satisfaction, and the world beheld how the mortal woman, Cleopatra, for her lover and herself, could steep this meagre life with the joys of the immortals.  He was grateful for them, and the most generous of men laid at the feet of the 'Great Queen of the East' the might of Rome and the kings of two quarters of the globe.  \"These years were spent by both in one long revel.  His marriage with Octavia brought the first awakening.  It was hard and painful.  He had not deserted Cleopatra for a woman's sake, but on account of his endangered power and sovereignty.  But the unloved Octavia constrained him to look up to her with respectful admiration--nay, she became dear to him.  \"A fierce battle for him and his heart arose between the two.  It was fought with very different weapons, and Cleopatra conquered.  The revel, the dream began again.  Then came Actium, the disenchantment, the awakening, the fall, the flight from the world.
