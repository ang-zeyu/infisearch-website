Try and get us some golden goblets, Bischen; the wine has no flavor out of these miserable brass mugs.  Cambyses surely would not wish us to suffer from poverty in our last hours, though he does forbid our fathers and friends to visit us.\"  \"It's not the metal that the cup is made of,\" said Bartja, \"but the wormwood of death, \"that gives the wine its bitter taste.\"  \"No, really, you're quite  out  there,\" exclaimed Zopyrus.  \"Why I had nearly forgotten that strangling generally causes death.\"  As he said this, he touched Gyges and whispered: \"Be as cheerful as you can!  don't you see that it's very hard for Bartja to take leave of this world?  What were you saying, Darius?\"  \"That I thought Oropastes' idea the only admissible one, that a Div had taken the likeness of Bartja and visited the Egyptian in order to ruin us.\"  \"Folly!  I don't believe in such things.\"  \"But don't you remember the legend of the Div, who took the beautiful form of a minstrel and appeared before king Kawus?\"  \"Of course,\" cried Araspes.  \"Cyrus had this legend so often recited at the banquets, that I know it by heart.  \"Kai Kawus hearkened to the words of the disguised Div and went to Masenderan, and was beaten there by the Divs and deprived of his eyesight.\"  \"But,\" broke in Darius, \"Rustem, the great hero, came and conquered Erscheng and the other bad spirits, freed the captives and restored sight to the blind, by dropping the blood of the slaughtered Divs into their eyes.  And so it will be with us, my friends!  We shall be set free, and the eyes of Cambyses and of our blind and infatuated fathers will be opened to see our innocence.  Listen, Bischen; if we really should be executed, go to the Magi, the Chaldwans, and Nebenchari the Egyptian, and tell them they had better not study the stars any longer, for that those very stars had proved themselves liars and deceivers to Darius.\"  \"Yes,\" interrupted Araspes, \"I always said that dreams were the only real prophecies.  Before Abradatas fell in the battle of Sardis, the peerless Panthea dreamt that she saw him pierced by a Lydian arrow.\"  \"You cruel fellow!\"  exclaimed Zopyrus.  \"Why do you remind us, that it is much more glorious to die in battle than to have our necks wrung off\"  \"Quite right,\" answered the elder man; \"I confess that I have seen many a death, which I should prefer to our own,--indeed to life itself.  Ah, boys, there was a time when things went better than they do now.\"  \"Tell us something about those times.\"  \"And tell us why you never married.  It won't matter to you in the next world, if we do let out your secret.\"  \"There's no secret; any of your own fathers could tell you what you want to hear from me.  Listen then.  When I was young, I used to amuse myself with women, but I laughed at the idea of love.  It occurred, however, that Panthea, the most beautiful of all women, fell into our hands, and Cyrus gave her into my charge, because I had always boasted that my heart was invulnerable.  I saw her everyday, and learnt, my friends, that love is stronger than a man's will.  However, she refused all my offers, induced Cyrus to remove me from my office near her, and to accept her husband Abradatas as an ally.  When her handsome husband went out to the war, this high-minded, faithful woman decked him out with all her own jewels and told him that the noble conduct of Cyrus, in treating her like a sister, when she was his captive, could only be repaid by the most devoted friendship and heroic courage.  Abradatas agreed with her, fought for Cyrus like a lion, and fell.  Panthea killed herself by his dead body.  Her servants, on hearing of this, put an end to their own lives too at the grave of this best of mistresses.  Cyrus shed tears over this noble pair, and had a stone set up to their memory, which you can see near Sardis.  On it are the simple words: 'To Panthea, Abradatas, and the most faithful of servants.'  You see, children, the man who had loved such a woman could never care for another.\"  The young men listened in silence, and remained some time after Araspes had finished, without uttering a word.  At last Bartja raised his hands to heaven and cried: \"O thou great Auramazda!  why dost thou not grant us a glorious end like Abradatas?  Why must we die a shameful death like murderers?\"  As he said this Croesus came in, fettered and led by whip-bearers.  The friends rushed to him with a storm of questions, and Bartja too went up to embrace the man who had been so long his tutor and guide.  But the old man's cheerful face was severe and serious, and his eyes, generally so mild, had a gloomy, almost threatening, expression.  He waved the prince coldly back, saying, in a voice which trembled with pain and reproach: \"Let my hand go, you infatuated boy! you are not worth all the love I have hitherto felt for you.  You have deceived your brother in a fourfold manner, duped your friends, betrayed that poor child who is waiting for you in Naukratis, and poisoned the heart of Amasis' unhappy daughter.\"  Bartja listened calmly till he heard the word \"deceived\"; then his hand clenched, and stamping his foot, he cried: \"But for your age and infirmities, and the gratitude I owe you, old man, these slanderous words would be your last.\"  Croesus beard this outbreak of just indignation unmoved, and answered: \"This foolish rage proves that you and Cambyses have the same blood in your veins.  It would become you much better to repent of your crimes, and beg your old friend's forgiveness, instead of adding ingratitude to the unheard-of baseness of your other deeds.\"  At these words Bartja's anger gave way.  His clenched hands sank down powerless at his side, and his cheeks became pale as death.  These signs of sorrow softened the old man's indignation.  His love was strong enough to embrace the guilty as well as the innocent Bartja, and taking the young man's right hand in both his own, he looked at him as a father would who finds his son, wounded on the battle-field, and said: \"Tell me, my poor, infatuated boy, how was it that your pure heart fell away so quickly to the evil powers?\"  Bartja shuddered.  The blood came back to his face, but these words cut him to the heart.  For the first time in his life his belief in the justice of the gods forsook him.  He called himself the victim of a cruel, inexorable fate, and felt like a bunted animal driven to its last gasp and hearing the dogs and sportsmen fast coming nearer.  He had a sensitive, childlike nature, which did not yet know how to meet the hard strokes of fate.  His body and his physical courage had been hardened against bodily and physical enemies; but his teachers had never told him how to meet a hard lot in life; for Cambyses and Bartja seemed destined only to drink out of the cup of happiness and joy.  Zopyrus could not bear to see his friend in tears.  He reproached the old man angrily with being unjust and severe.  Gyges' looks were full of entreaty, and Araspes stationed himself between the old man and the youth, as if to ward off the blame of the elder from cutting deeper into the sad and grieved heart of the younger man.  Darius, however, after having watched them for some time, came up with quiet deliberation to Croesus, and said: \"You continue to distress and offend one another, and yet the accused does not seem to know with what offence he is charged, nor will the accuser hearken to his defence.  Tell us, Croesus, by the friendship which has subsisted between us up to this clay, what has induced you to judge Bartja so harshly, when only a short time ago you believed in his innocence?\"  The old man told at once what Darius desired to know--that he had seen a letter, written in Nitetis' own hand, in which she made a direct confession of her love to Bartja and asked him to meet her alone.  The testimony of his own eyes and of the first men in the realm, nay, even the dagger found under Nitetis' windows, had not been able to convince him that his favorite was guilty; but this letter had gone like a burning flash into his heart and destroyed the last remnant of his belief in the virtue and purity of woman.  \"I left the king,\" he concluded, \"perfectly convinced that a sinful intimacy must subsist between your friend and the Egyptian Princess, whose heart I had believed to be a mirror for goodness and beauty alone. Can you find fault with me for blaming him who so shamefully stained this clear mirror, and with it his own not less spotless soul?\"  \"But how can I prove my innocence?\"  cried Bartja, wringing his hands. \"If you loved me you would believe me; if you really cared for me.....\"  \"My boy!  in trying to save your life only a few minutes ago, I forfeited my own.  When I heard that Cambyses had really resolved on your death, I hastened to him with a storm of entreaties; but these were of no avail, and then I was presumptuous enough to reproach him bitterly in his irritated state of mind.  The weak thread of his patience broke, and in a fearful passion he commanded the guards to behead me at once.  I was seized directly by Giv, one of the whip-bearers; but as the man is under obligations to me, he granted me my life until this morning, and promised to conceal the postponement of the execution.  I am glad, my sons, that I shall not outlive you, and shall die an innocent man by the side of the guilty.\"  These last words roused another storm of contradiction.  Again Darius remained calm and quiet in the midst of the tumult.  He repeated once more the story of the whole evening exactly, to prove that it was impossible Bartja could have committed the crime laid to his charge.  He then called on the accused himself to answer the charge of disloyalty and perfidy.

D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 2.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 7.    CHAPTER V.  Before the sun had reached his mid-day height, the news of what had happened and of what was still to happen had filled all Babylon.  The streets swarmed with people, waiting impatiently to see the strange spectacle which the punishment of one of the king's wives, who had proved false and faithless, promised to afford.  The whip-bearers were forced to use all their authority to keep this gaping crowd in order.  Later on in the day the news that Bartja and his friends were soon to be executed arrived among the crowd; they were under the influence of the palm-wine, which was liberally distributed on the king's birthday and the following days, and could not control their excited feelings; but these now took quite another form.  Bands of drunken men paraded the streets, crying: \"Bartja, the good son of Cyrus, is to be executed!\"  The women heard these words in their quiet apartments, eluded their keepers, forgot their veils, and rushing forth into the streets, followed the excited and indignant men with cries and yells.  Their pleasure in the thought of seeing a more fortunate sister humbled, vanished at the painful news that their beloved prince was condemned to death.  Men, women and children raged, stormed and cursed, exciting one another to louder and louder bursts of indignation.  The workshops were emptied, the merchants closed their warehouses, and the school-boys and servants, who had a week's holiday on occasion of the king's birthday, used their freedom to scream louder than any one else, and often to groan and yell without in the least knowing why.  At last the tumult was so great that the whip-bearers were insufficient to cope with it, and a detachment of the body-guard was sent to patrol the streets.  At the sight of their shining armor and long lances, the crowd retired into the side streets, only, however, to reassemble in fresh numbers when the troops were out of sight.  At the gate, called the Bel gate, which led to the great western high- road, the throng was thicker than at any other point, for it was said that through this gate, the one by which she had entered Babylon, the Egyptian Princess was to be led out of the city in shame and disgrace. For this reason a larger number of whipbearers were stationed here, in order to make way for travellers entering the city.  Very few people indeed left the city at all on this day, for curiosity was stronger than either business or pleasure; those, on the other hand, who arrived from the country, took up their stations near the gate on hearing what had drawn the crowd thither.  It was nearly mid-day, and only wanted a few hours to the time fixed for Nitetis' disgrace, when a caravan approached the gate with great speed. The first carriage was a so-called harmamaxa, drawn by four horses decked out with bells and tassels; a two-wheeled cart followed, and last in the train was a baggage-wagon drawn by mules.  A fine, handsome man of about fifty, dressed as a Persian courtier, and another, much older, in long white robes, occupied the first carriage.  The cart was filled by a number of slaves in simple blouses, and broad-brimmed felt hats, wearing the hair cut close to the head.  An old man, dressed as a Persian servant, rode by the side of the cart.  The driver of the first carriage had great difficulty in making way for his gaily-ornamented horses through the crowd; he was obliged to come to a halt before the gate and call some whip-bearers to his assistance.  \"Make way for us!\"  he cried to the captain of the police who came up with some of his men; \"the royal post has no time to lose, and I am driving some one, who will make you repent every minute's delay.\"  \"Softly, my son,\" answered the official.  \"Don't you see that it's easier to-day to get out of Babylon, than to come in?  Whom are you driving?\"  \"A nobleman, with a passport from the king.  Come, be quick and make way for us.\"  \"I don't know about that; your caravan does not look much like royalty.\"  \"What have you to do with that?  The pass....\" \"I must see it, before I let you into the city.\"  These words were halfmeant for the traveller, whom he was scrutinizing very suspiciously.  While the man in the Persian dress was feeling in his sleeve for the passport, the whip-bearer turned to some comrades who had just come up, and pointed out the scanty retinue of the travellers, saying: \"Did you ever see such a queer cavalcade?  There's something odd about these strangers, as sure as my name's Giv.  Why, the lowest of the king's carpet-bearers travels with four times as many people, and yet this man has a royal pass and is dressed like one of those who sit at the royal table.\"  At this moment the suspected traveller handed him a little silken roll scented with musk, sealed with the royal seal, and containing the king's own handwriting.  The whip-bearer took it and examined the seal.  \"It is all in order,\" he murmured, and then began to study the characters.  But no sooner had he deciphered the first letters than be looked even more sharply than before at the traveller, and seized the horses' bridles, crying out: \"Here, men, form a guard round the carriage! this is an impostor.\"  When he had convinced himself that escape was impossible, he went up to the stranger again and said: \"You are using a pass which does not belong to you.  Gyges, the son of Croesus, the man you give yourself out for, is in prison and is to be executed to-day.  You are not in the least like him, and you will have reason to repent leaving tried to pass for him. Get out of your carriage and follow me.\"  The traveller, however, instead of obeying, began to speak in broken Persian, and begged the officer rather to take a seat by him in the carriage, for that he had very important news to communicate.  The man hesitated a moment; but on seeing a fresh band of whip-bearers come up, he nodded to them to stand before the impatient, chafing horses, and got into the carriage.  The stranger looked at him with a smile and said: \"Now, do I look like an impostor?\"  \"No; your language proves that you are not a Persian, but yet you look like a nobleman.\"  \"I am a Greek, and have come hither to render Cambyses an important service.  Gyges is my friend, and lent me his passport when he was in Egypt, in case I should ever come to Persia.  I am prepared to vindicate my conduct before the king, and have no reason for fear.  On the contrary, the news I bring gives me reason to expect much from his favor. Let me be taken to Croesus, if this is your duty; he will be surety for me, and will send back your men, of whom you seem to stand in great need to-day.  Distribute these gold pieces among them, and tell me without further delay what my poor friend Gyges has done to deserve death, and what is the reason of all this crowd and confusion.\"  The stranger said this in bad Persian, but there lay so much dignity and confidence in his tone, and his gifts were on such a large scale, that the cringing and creeping servant of despotism felt sure he must be sitting opposite to a prince, crossed his arms reverentially, and, excusing himself from his many pressing affairs, began to relate rapidly. He had been on duty in the great hall during the examination of the prisoners the night before, and could therefore tell all that had happened with tolerable accuracy.  The Greek followed his tale eagerly, with many an incredulous shake of his handsome head, however, when the daughter of Amasis and the son of Cyrus were spoken of as having been disloyal and false, that sentence of death had been pronounced, especially on Croesus, distressed him visibly, but the sadness soon vanished from his quickly-changing features, and gave place to thought; this in its turn was quickly followed by a joyful look, which could only betoken that the thinker had arrived at a satisfactory result.  His dignified gravity vanished in a moment; he laughed aloud, struck his forehead merrily, seized the hand of the astonished captain, and said:  \"Should you be glad, if Bartja could be saved?\"  \"More than I can say.\"  \"Very well, then I will vouch for it, that you shall receive at least two talents, if you can procure me an interview with the king before the first execution has taken place.\"  \"How can you ask such a thing of me, a poor captain?  .  .  .\"  \"Yes, you must, you must!\"  \"I cannot.\"  \"I know well that it is very difficult, almost impossible, for a stranger to obtain an audience of your king; but my errand brooks no delay, for I can prove that Bartja and his friends are not guilty.  Do you hear?  I can prove it.  Do you think now, you can procure me admittance?\"  \"How is it possible?\"  \"Don't ask, but act.  Didn't you say Darius was one of the condemned?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I have heard, that his father is a man of very high rank.\"  \"He is the first in the kingdom, after the sons of Cyrus.\"  \"Then take me to him at once.  He will welcome me when he hears I am able to save his son.\"  \"Stranger, you are a wonderful being.  You speak with so much confidence that .  .  .\"  \"That you feel you may believe me.  Make haste then, and call some of your men to make way for us, and escort us to the palace.\"  There is nothing, except a doubt, which runs more quickly from mind to mind, than a hope that some cherished wish may be fulfilled, especially when this hope has been suggested to us by some one we can trust.  The officer believed this strange traveller, jumped out of the carriage, flourishing his scourge and calling to his men: \"This nobleman has come on purpose to prove Bartja's innocence, and must be taken to the king at once.  Follow me, my friends, and make way for him!\"  Just at that"]]]
