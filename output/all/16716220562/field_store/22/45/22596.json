That America should bring forth a peculiar people, like the Mormons, is as natural as that a mother should bear children in the semblance of the father who begat them. Monstrous, indeed, would it be if, as offspring of the patriarchs and mothers of this nation, America brought forth naught but godless politicians.    CHAPTER II.  THE MOTHER OF THE PROPHET--THE GIFTS OF INSPIRATION AND WORKING OF MIRACLES INHERENT IN HER FAMILY--FRAGMENTS OF HER NARRATIVE.  First among the chosen women of the latter-day dispensation comes the mother of the Prophet, to open this divine drama.  It is one of our most beautiful and suggestive proverbs that \"great men have great mothers.\" This cannot but be peculiarly true of a great prophet whose soul is conceptive of a new dispensation.  Prophecy is of the woman. She endows her offspring with that heaven-born gift.  The father of Joseph was a grand patriarchal type. He was the Abraham of the Church, holding the office of presiding patriarch. To this day he is remembered and spoken of by the early disciples with the profoundest veneration and filial love, and his patriarchal blessings, given to them, are preserved and valued as much as are the patriarchal blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob valued by their own race.  But it is the mother of the Prophet who properly leads in opening the testament of the women of Mormondom. She was a prophetess and seeress born. The gift of prophecy and the power to work miracles also inhered in the family of Lucy Mack, (her maiden name), and the martial spirit which distinguished her son, making him a prophet-general, was quite characteristic of her race. Of her brother, Major Mack, she says:  \"My brother was in the city of Detroit in 1812, the year in which Hull surrendered the territory to the British crown. My brother, being somewhat celebrated for his prowess, was selected by General Hull to take the command of a company as captain. After a short service in this office he was ordered to surrender. (Hull's surrender to the British). At this his indignation was aroused to the highest pitch. He broke his sword across his knee, and throwing it into the river, exclaimed that he would never submit to such a disgraceful compromise while the blood of an American continued to flow in his veins.\"  Lucy Mack's father, Solomon Mack, was a soldier in the American revolution. He entered the army at the age of twenty-one, in the year 1755, and in the glorious struggle of his country for independence he enlisted among the patriots in 1776. With him were his two boys, Jason and Stephen, the latter being the same who afterwards broke his sword and cast it into the river rather than surrender it to the British.  But that which is most interesting here is the seeric gift coupled with the miracle-working power of \"Mother Lucy's\" race. Hers was a \"visionary\" family, in the main, while her elder brother, Jason, was a strange evangelist, who wandered about during his lifetime, by sea and land, preaching the gospel and working miracles. This Jason even attempted to establish a body of Christian communists. Of him she says:  \"Jason, my oldest brother, was a studious and manly boy. Before he had attained his sixteenth year he became what was then called a 'seeker,' and believing that by prayer and faith the gifts of the gospel, which were enjoyed by the ancient disciples of Christ, might be attained, he labored almost incessantly to convert others to the same faith. He was also of the opinion that God would, at some subsequent period, manifest His power, as He had anciently done, in signs and wonders. At the age of twenty he became a preacher of the gospel.\"  Then followed a love episode in Jason's life, in which the young man was betrayed by his rival while absent in England on business with his father. The rival gave out that Jason had died in Liverpool, (being post-master, he had also intercepted their correspondence,) so that when the latter returned home he found his betrothed married to his enemy. The story runs:  \"As soon as Jason arrived he repaired immediately to her father's house. When he got there she was gone to her brother's funeral; he went in, and seated himself in the same room where he had once paid his addresses to her. In a short time she came home; when she first saw him she did not know him, but when she got a full view of his countenance she recognized him, and instantly fainted. From this time forward she never recovered her health, but, lingering for two years, died the victim of disappointment.  \"Jason remained in the neighborhood a short time and then went to sea, but he did not follow the sea a great while. He soon left the main, and commenced preaching, which he continued until his death.\"  Once or twice during his lifetime Jason visited his family; at last, after a silence of twenty years, his brother Solomon received from him the following very evangelistic epistle:                                               \"South Branch of Ormucto,                                             \"Province of New Brunswick,                                                         \"June 30, 1835.      \"MY DEAR BROTHER SOLOMON: You will, no doubt, be surprised to hear     that I am still alive, although in an absence of twenty years I     have never written to you before. But I trust you will forgive me     when I tell you that, for most of the twenty years, I have been so     situated that I have had little or no communication with the lines,     and have been holding meetings, day and night, from place to place;     besides my mind has been so taken up with the deplorable situation     of the earth, the darkness in which it lies, that, when my labors     did call me near the lines, I did not realize the opportunity which     presented itself of letting you know where I was. And, again, I     have designed visiting you long since, and annually have promised     myself that the succeeding year I would certainly seek out my     relatives, and enjoy the privilege of one pleasing interview with     them before I passed into the valley and shadow of death. But     last, though not least, let me not startle you when I say, that,     according to my early adopted principles of the power of faith, the     Lord has, in his exceeding kindness, bestowed upon me the gift of     healing by the prayer of faith, and the use of such simple means as     seem congenial to the human system; but my chief reliance is upon     Him who organized us at the first, and can restore at pleasure that     which is disorganized.      \"The first of my peculiar success in this way was twelve years     since, and from nearly that date I have had little rest. In     addition to the incessant calls which I in a short time had, there     was the most overwhelming torrent of opposition poured down upon     me that I ever witnessed. But it pleased God to take the weak to     confound the wisdom of the wise. I have in the last twelve years     seen the greatest manifestations of the power of God in healing     the sick, that, with all my sanguinity, I ever hoped or imagined.     And when the learned infidel has declared with sober face, time     and again, that disease had obtained such an ascendency that death     could be resisted no longer, that the victim must wither beneath     his potent arm, I have seen the almost lifeless clay slowly but     surely resuscitated and revived, till the pallid monster fled so     far that the patient was left in the full bloom of vigorous health.     But it is God that hath done it, and to Him let all the praise be     given.      \"I am now compelled to close this epistle, for I must start     immediately on a journey of more than one hundred miles, to attend     a heavy case of sickness; so God be with you all. Farewell!                                                       \"JASON MACK.\"  \"Mother Lucy,\" in the interesting accounts of her own and husband's families, tells some charming stories of visions, dreams, and miracles among them, indicating the advent of the latter-day power; but the remarkable visions and mission of her prophet son claim the ruling place. She says:  \"There was a great revival of religion, which extended to all the denominations of Christians in the surrounding country in which we resided. Many of the world's people, becoming concerned about the salvation of their souls, came forward and presented themselves as seekers after religion. Most of them were desirous of uniting with some church, but were not decided as to the particular faith which they would adopt. When the numerous meetings were about breaking up, and the candidates and the various leading church members began to consult upon the subject of adopting the candidates into some church or churches, as the case might be, a dispute arose, and there was a great contention among them.  \"While these things were going forward, Joseph's mind became considerably troubled with regard to religion; and the following extract from his history will show, more clearly than I can express, the state of his feelings, and the result of his reflections on this occasion:\"      \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was     proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined     that church, namely, my mother Lucy, my brothers Hyrum and Samuel     Harrison, and my sister Sophronia.      \"During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to     serious reflection and great uneasiness. * * * * The Presbyterians     were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all     their powers of either reason or sophistry to prove their errors,     or at least to make the people think they were in error. On the     other hand the Baptists and Methodists, in their turn, were equally     zealous to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.      \"In the midst of this war of words, and tumult of opinions, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],["title","The Women of Mormondom (#3)"],["body","often     said to myself, what is to be done? Who, of all these parties,     are right? or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be     right, which is it? and how shall I know it?      \"While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the     contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading     the epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads,     'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth unto     all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.'     Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the     heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to     enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected     on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom     from God, I did, for how to act I did not know, and, unless I     could get more wisdom than I then had, would never know; for the     teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same     passage so differently, as to destroy all confidence in settling     the question by an appeal to the Bible. At length I came to the     conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or     else I must do as James directs--that is, ask of God. I at last     came to the determination to ask of God. So in accordance with     this determination I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It     was on the morning of a beautiful clear day, early in the spring     of 1820. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an     attempt; for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the     attempt to pray vocally. After I had retired into the place where I     had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding     myself alone, I knelt down and began to offer up the desires of     my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was     seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such     astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue, so that I     could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed     to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But     exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the     power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very     moment when I was ready to sink into despair, and abandon myself     to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some     actual being from the unseen world, who had such a marvelous power     as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of     great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above     the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell     upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from     the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw     two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,     standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me     by name, and said, pointing to the other, 'this is my beloved son,     hear him:'      \"My object in going to inquire of the Lord, was to know which of     all these sects was right, that I might know which to join. No     sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able     to speak, than I asked the personages who stood above me in the     light, which of all the sects was right--for at this time it had     never entered into my heart that all were wrong--and which I should     join. I was answered that I should join none of them, for they were     all wrong; and the personage who addressed me said that all their     creeds were an abomination in His sight; that those professors were     all corrupt. 'They draw near me with their lips, but their hearts     are far from me; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men,     having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.' He     again forbade me to join any of them; and many other things did     he say unto me which I cannot write at this time. When I came to     myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into     heaven.\"  \"From this time until the 21st of September, 1823, Joseph continued, as usual, to labor with his father, and nothing during this interval occurred of very great importance,--though he suffered, as one would naturally suppose, every kind of opposition and persecution from the different orders of religionists.  \"On the evening of the 21st of September, he retired to his bed in quite a serious and contemplative state of mind. He shortly betook himself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God, for a manifestation of his standing before Him, and while thus engaged he received the following vision:\"      \"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a     light appearing in the room, which continued to increase until the     room was lighter than at noon-day, when immediately a personage     appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did     not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of most exquisite     whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever     seen, nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to     appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked,     and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so also were his     feet naked, as were his legs a little above the ankles. His head     and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other     clothing on but his robe, as it was open so that I could see into     his bosom. Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole     person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly     like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very     bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon     him I was afraid, but the fear soon left me. He called me by name,     and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of     God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for     me to do, and that my name should be had for good and evil among     all nations, kindreds and tongues; or that it should be both good     and evil spoken of among all people. He said there was a book     deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the     former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence     they sprung. He also said that the fullness of the everlasting     gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Saviour to the     ancient inhabitants. Also, that there were two stones in silver     bows, and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted     what is called the urim and thummim, deposited with the plates;     and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted     seers in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them     for the purpose of translating the book. After telling me these     things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament.     He first quoted a part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he     quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy,     though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bible.     Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he     quoted it thus: 'For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an     oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall burn     as stubble, for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord     of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.' And     again he quoted the fifth verse thus: 'Behold, I will reveal unto     you the priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the     coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.' He also quoted     the next verse differently: 'And he shall plant in the hearts of     the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of     the children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the     whole earth would be utterly wasted at its coming.' In addition to     these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was     about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts,     twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in     our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ, but the     day had not yet come 'when they who would not hear His voice should     be cut off from among the people,' but soon would come. He also     quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to     the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was     soon to be. And he further stated the fullness of the Gentiles was     soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and     offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here. Again, he     told me that when I got those plates of which he had spoken (for     the time that they should be obtained was not then fulfilled),     I should not show them to any person, neither the breast-plate,     with the urim and thummim, only to those to whom I should be     commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he     was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to     my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited,     and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when     I visited it.      \"After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to     gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking     to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left     dark, except just around him; when instantly I saw, as it were,     a conduit open right up into Heaven, and he ascended up until he     entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before     this heavenly light made its appearance.      \"I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling     greatly at what had been told me by this extraordinary"]]]
