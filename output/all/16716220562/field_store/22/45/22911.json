How you rush at conclusions!  What he found out is next to nothing.  I had only a minute to speak to Hiram.  To-morrow morning he is to bring the man to me.  The only thing he told me.  .  .\"  \"By Christ's Wounds!  What was it?\"  \"He said that the messenger had heard of an elderly recluse, who had formerly been a great warrior.\"  \"My father, my father!\"  cried Paula.  \"Hiram is sitting by the fire with the others.  Fetch him here at once--at once; I command you, Perpetua, do you hear?  Oh best, dearest Betta!  Come with me; we will go to him.\"  \"Patience, sweetheart, a little patience!\"  urged the nurse.  \"Ah, poor dear soul, it will turn out to be nothing again; and if we again follow up a false clue it will only lead to fresh disappointment.\"  \"Never mind: you are to come with me.\"  \"To all the servants round the fire, and at this time of night?  I should think so indeed!--But do you wait here, child.  I know how it can be managed.  \"I will wake Hiram's Joseph.  He sleeps in the stable yonder--and then he will fetch his father.  Ah! what impatience!  What a stormy, passionate little heart it is!  If I do not do your bidding, I shall have you awake all night, and wandering about to-morrow as if in a dream.--There, be quiet, be quiet, I am going.\"  As she spoke she wrapped her kerchief round her head and hurried out; Paula fell on her knees before the crucifix over the bed, and prayed fervently till her nurse returned, Soon after she heard a man's steps on the stairs and Hiram came in.  He was a powerful man of about fifty, with a pair of honest blue eyes in his plain face.  Any one looking at his broad chest would conclude that when he spoke it would be in a deep bass voice; but Hiram had stammered from his infancy; and from constant companionship with horses he had accustomed himself to make a variety of strange, inarticulate noises in a high, shrill voice.  Besides, he was always unwilling to speak.  When he found himself face to face with the daughter of his master and benefactor, he knelt at her feet, looked up at her with faithful, dog- like eyes full of affection, and kissed first her dress, and then her hand which she held out to him.  Paula kindly but decidedly cut short the expressions of delight at seeing her again which he painfully stammered out; and when he at length began to tell his story his words came far too slowly for her impatience.  He told her that the Nabathaean who had brought the rumor that had excited her hopes, was not unwilling to follow up the trace he had found, but he would not wait beyond noon the next day and had tried to bid for high terms.  \"He shall have them--as much as he wants!\"  cried Paula.  But Hiram entreated her, more by looks and vague cries than by articulate words, not to hope for too much.  Dusare the Nabathaean--Perpetua now took up the tale--had heard of a recluse, living at Raithu on the Red Sea, who had been a great warrior, by birth a Greek, and who for two years had been leading a life of penance in great seclusion among the pious brethren on the sacred Mount of Sinai.  The messenger had not been able to learn what his name in the world had been, but among the hermits he was known as Paulus.\"  \"Paulus!\"  interrupted the girl with panting breath.  \"A name that must remind him of my mother and of me, yes, of me!  And he, the hero of Damascus, who was called Thomas in the world, believing that I was dead, has no doubt dedicated himself to the service of God and of Christ, and has taken the name of Paulus, as Saul, the other man of Damascus did after his con version,--exactly like him!  Oh!  Betta, Hiram, you will see: it is he, it must be!  How can you doubt it?\"  The Syrian shook his head doubtfully and gave vent to a long-drawn whistle, and Perpetua clasped her hands exclaiming distressfully: \"Did I not say so?  She takes the fire lighted by shepherds at night to warm their hands for the rising sun--the rattle of chariots for the thunders of the Almighty!--Why, how many thousands have called themselves Paulus! By all the Saints, child, I beseech you keep quiet, and do not try to weave a holiday-robe out of airy mist!  Be prepared for the worst; then you are armed against failure and preserve your right to hope!  Tell her, tell her, Hiram, what else the messenger said; it is nothing positive; everything is as uncertain as dust in the breeze.\"  The freedman then explained that this Nabathaean was a trustworthy man, far better skilled in such errands than himself, for he understood both Syriac and Egyptian, Greek and Aramaic; and nevertheless he had failed to find out anything more about this hermit Paulus at Tor, where the monks of the monastery of the Transfiguration had a colony.  Subsequently, however, on the sea voyage to Holzum, he had been informed by some monks that there was a second Sinai.  The monastery there--but here Perpetua again was the speaker, for the hapless stammerer's brow was beaded with sweat--the monastery at the foot of the peaked, heaven-kissing mountain, had been closed in consequence of the heresies of its inhabitants; but in the gorges of these great heights there were still many recluses, some in a small Coenobium, some in Lauras and separate caves, and among these perchance Paulus might be found.  This clue seemed a good one and she and Hiram had already made up their minds to follow it up; but the warrior monk was very possibly a stranger, and they had thought it would be cruel to expose her to so keen a disappointment.  Here Paula interrupted her, crying in joyful excitement:  \"And why should not something besides disappointment be my portion for once?  How could you have the heart to deprive me of the hope on which my poor heart still feeds?--But I will not be robbed of it.  Your Paulus of Sinai is my lost father.  I feel it, I know it!  If I had not sold my pearls, the Nabathaean. . . . But as it is.  When can you start, my good Hiram?\"  \"Not before a fort--a fortnight at--at--at--soonest,\" said the man. \"I am in the governor's service now, and the day after to-morrow is the great horse-fair at Niku.  The young master wants some stallions bought and there are our foals to. . . .\"  \"I will implore my uncle to-morrow, to spare you,\" cried Paula. \"I will go on my knees to him.\"  \"He will not let him go,\" said the nurse.  \"Sebek the steward told him all about it from me before the hour of audience and tried to have Hiram released.\"  \"And he said.... ?\"  \"The lady Neforis said it was all a mere will-o'-the-wisp, and my lord agreed with her.  Then your uncle forbade Sebek to betray the matter to you, and sent word to me that he would possibly send Hiram to Sinai when the horse-fair was over.  So take patience, sweetheart.  What are two weeks, or at most three--and then. . . .\"  \"But I shall die before then!\"  cried Paula.  \"The Nabathaean, you say, is here and willing to go.\"  \"Yes, Mistress.\"  \"Then we will secure him,\" said Paula resolutely.  Perpetua, however, who must have discussed the matter fully with her fellow-countryman, shook her head mournfully and said: \"He asks too much for us!\"  She then explained that the man, being such a good linguist, had already been offered an engagement to conduct a caravan to Ctesiphon.  This would be a year's pay to him, and he was not inclined to break off his negotiations with the merchant Hanno and search the deserts of Arabia Petraea for less than two thousand drachmae.  \"Two thousand drachmae!\"  echoed Paula, looking down in distress and confusion; but she presently looked up and exclaimed with angry determination: \"How dare they keep from me that which is my own?  If my uncle refuses what I have to ask, and will ask, then the inevitable must happen, though for his sake it will grieve me; I must put my affairs in the hands of the judges.\"  \"The judges?\"  Perpetua smiled.  \"But you cannot lay a complaint without your kyrios, and your uncle is yours.  Besides: before they have settled the matter the messenger may have been to Ctesiphon and back, far as it is.\"  Again her nurse entreated her to have patience till the horse-fair should be over.  Paula fixed her eyes on the ground.  She seemed quite crushed; but Perpetua started violently and Hiram drew back a step when she suddenly broke out in a loud, joyful cry of \"Father in Heaven, I have what we need!\"  \"How, child, what?\"  asked the nurse, pressing her hand to her heart. But Paula vouchsafed no information; she turned quickly to the Syrian:  \"Is the outer court-yard clear yet?  Are the people gone?\"  she asked.  The reply was in the affirmative.  The freed servants had retired when Hiram left them.  The officials would not break up for some time yet, but there was less difficulty in passing them.  \"Very good,\" said the girl.  \"Then you, Hiram, lead the way and wait for me by the little side door.  I will give you something in my room which will pay the Nabathaean's charges ten times over.  Do not look so horrified, Betta.  I will give him the large emerald out of my mother's necklace.\"  The woman clasped her hands, and cried out in dismay and warning.  \"Child, child!  That splendid gem!  an heirloom in the family--that stone which came to you from the saintly Emperor Theodosius--to sell that of all things!  Nay-to throw it away; not to rescue your father either, but merely--yes child, for that is the truth, merely because you lack patience to wait two little weeks!\"  \"That is hard, that is unjust, Betta,\" Paula broke in reprovingly.  \"It will be a question of a month, and we all know how much depends on the messenger.  Do you forget how highly Hiram spoke of this very man's intelligence?  And besides--must I, the younger, remind you?--What is the life of man?  An instant may decide his life or death; and my father is an old man, scarred from many wounds even before the siege.  It may make just the difference between our meeting, or never meeting again.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5518"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 02 (#5)"],["body","old woman in subdued tones, \"perhaps you are right, and if I.  .  .\"  But Paula stopped her mouth with a kiss, and then desired Hiram to carry the gem, the first thing in the morning, to Gamaliel the Jew, a wealthy and honest man, and not to sell it for less than twelve thousand drachmae.  If the goldsmith could not pay so much for it at once, he might be satisfied to bring away the two thousand drachmae for the messenger, and fetch the remainder at another season.  The Syrian led the way, and when, after a long leave-taking, she quitted her nurse's pleasant little room, Hiram had done her bidding and was waiting for her at the little side door.     CHAPTER VIII.  As Hiram had supposed, the better class of the household were still sitting with their friends, and they had been joined by the guide and by the Arab merchant's head man: Rustem the Masdakite, as well as his secretary and interpreter.  With the exception only of Gamaliel the Jewish goldsmith, and the Arab's followers, the whole of the party were Christians; and it had gone against the grain to admit the Moslems into their circle--the Jew had for years been a welcome member of the society.  However, they had done so, and not without marked civility; for their lord had desired that the strangers should be made welcome, and they might expect to hear much that was new from wanderers from such a distance.  In this, to be sure, they were disappointed, for the dragoman was taciturn and the Masdakite could speak no Egyptian, and Greek very ill.  So, after various futile attempts to make the new-comers talk, they paid no further heed to them, and Orion's secretary became the chief speaker.  He had already told them yesterday much that was fresh and interesting about the Imperial court; to-day he entered into fuller details of the brilliant life his young lord had led at Constantinople, whither he had accompanied him.  He described the three races he had won in the Circus with his own horses; gave a lively picture of his forcing his way with only five followers through a raging mob of rioters, from the palace to the church of St. Sophia; and then enlarged on Orion's successes among the beauties of the Capital.  \"The queen of them all,\" he went on in boastful accents, \"was Heliodora --no flute-player nor anything of that kind; no indeed, but a rich, elegant, and virtuous patrician lady, the widow of Flavianus, nephew to Justinus the senator, and a relation of the Emperor.  All Constantinople was at her feet, the great Gratian himself sought to win her, but of course, in vain.  There is no palace to compare with hers in all Egypt, not even in Alexandria.  The governor's residence here--for I think nothing of mere size--is a peasant's hut--a wretched barn by comparison! I will tell you another time what that casket of treasures is like.  Its door was besieged day and night by slaves and freedmen bringing her offerings of flowers and fruit, rare gifts, and tender verses written on perfumed, rose-colored silk; but her favors were not to be purchased till she met Orion.  Would you believe it: from the first time she saw him in Justinus' villa she fell desperately in love with him; it was all over with her; she was his as completely as the ring on my finger is mine!\"  And in his vanity he showed his hearers a gold ring, with a gem of some value, which he owed to the liberality of his young master.  \"From that day forth,\" he eagerly went on, \"the names of Orion and Heliodora were in every mouth, and how often have I seen men quite beside themselves over the beauty of this divine pair.  In the Circus, in the theatre, or sailing about the Bosphorus--they were to be seen everywhere together; and through the hideous, bloody struggle for the throne they lived in a Paradise of their own.  He often took her out in his chariot; or she took him in hers.\"  \"Such a woman has horses too?\"  asked the head groom contemptuously.  \"A woman!\" cried the secretary.  \"A lady of rank!--She has none but bright chestnuts; large horses of Armenian breed, and small, swift beasts from the island of Sardinia, which fly on with the chariot, four abreast, like hunted foxes.  Her horses are always decked with flowers and ribbons fluttering from the gold harness, and the grooms know how to drive them too!--Well, every one thought that our young lord and the handsome widow would marry; and it was a terrible blow to the hapless Heliodora when nothing came of it--she looks like a saint and is as soft as a kitten. I was by when they parted, and she shed such bitter tears it was pitiable to see.  Still, she could not be angry with her idol, poor, gentle, tender kitten.  She even gave him her lap-dog for a keepsake--that little silky thing you have seen here.  And take my word for it, that was a true love-token, for her heart was as much set on that little beast as if it had been her favorite child.  And he felt the parting too, felt it deeply; however, I am his confidential secretary, and it would never do for me to tell tales out of school.  He clasped the little dog to his heart as he bid her farewell, and he promised her to send some keepsake in return which should show her how precious her love had been--and it will be no trifle, that any one may swear who knows my master.  You, Gamaliel, I daresay he has been to you about it by this time.\"  The man thus addressed--the same to whom Hiram was to offer Paula's emerald--was a rich Alexandrian of a happy turn of mind; as soon as the incursion of the Saracens had made Alexandria an unsafe residence, so that the majority of his fellow Israelites had fled from the great port, he had found his way to Memphis, where he could count on the protection of his patron, the Mukaukas George.  He shook his grizzled curls at this question, but he presently whispered in the secretary's ear.  \"We have the very thing he wants.  You bring me the cow and you shall have a calf--and a calf with twelve legs too.  Is it a bargain?\"  \"Twelve per cent on the profits?  Done!\"  replied the secretary in the same tone, with a sly smile of intelligence.  When, by-and-bye, an accountant asked him why Orion had not brought home this fair dame, the bearer too of a noble name, to his parents as their daughter-in-law, he replied that, being a Greek, she was of course a Melchite.  Those present asked no better reason; as soon as the question of creed was raised the conversation, as usual in these convivial evenings, became a squabble over dogmatic differences; in the course of it a legal official ventured to opine that if the case had been that of a less personage than a son of the Mukaukas--for whom it was, of course, out of the question--of a mere Jacobite citizen and his Melchite sweetheart, for instance, some compromise might have been effected. They need only have made up their minds each, respectively, to subscribe to the Monothelitic doctrine--though, he, for his part, could have nothing to say to anything of the kind; it was warmly upheld by the Imperial court, and by Cyrus, the deceased patriarch of Alexandria, and was based on the assumption that there were indeed two natures in Christ, but both under the control of one and the same will.  By this dogma there were in the Saviour two persons no doubt; still it asserted His unity in a certain qualified sense, and this was the most important point.  Such an heretical proposition was of course loudly disapproved of by the assembled Jacobites; differences of opinion were more and more strongly asserted, and a calm interchange of views turned to a riotous quarrel which threatened to end in actual violence.  This discussion was already beginning when Paula succeeded in slipping unseen across the court-yard.  She silently beckoned to Hiram to follow her; he cautiously took off his shoes, pushed them under the steep servants' stairs, and in a few minutes was standing in the young girl's room.  Paula at once opened a chest, and took out a costly and beautifully-wrought necklace set with pearls.  This she handed to the Syrian, desiring him to wrench from its setting a large emerald which hung from the middle.  The freedman's strong hand, with the aid of a knife, quickly and easily did the work; and he stood weighing the gem, as it lay freed from the gold hemisphere that had held it, larger than a walnut, shining and sparkling on his palm, while Paula repeated the instructions she had already given him in her nurse's room.  The faithful soul had no sooner left his beloved mistress than she proceeded to unplait her long thick hair, smiling the while with happy hope; but she had not yet begun to undress when she heard a knock.  She started, flew to the door and hastily bolted it, while she enquired:  \"Who is there?\"--preparing herself for the worst.  \"Hiram,\" was the whispered reply.  She opened the door, and he told her that meanwhile the side door had been locked, and that he knew no other way out from the great rambling house whither he rarely had occasion to come.  What was to be done?  He could not wait till the door was opened again, for he must carry out her commission quite early in the morning, and if he were caught and locked up for only half the day the Nabathaean would take some other engagement.  With swift decision she twisted up her hair, threw a handkerchief over her head, and said: \"Then come with me; the moon is still up; it would not be safe to carry a lamp.  I will lead the way and you must keep behind me  If only the kitchen is empty, we can reach the Viridarium unseen.  If the upper servants are still sitting in the court-yard the great door will be open, for several of them sleep in the house.  At any rate you must go through the vestibule; you cannot miss your way out of the viridarium.  But stay! Beki generally lies in front of the tablinum-- the fierce dog from Herrionthis in Thebais; and he does not know you, for he never goes out of the house, but he will obey me.  \"When I lift my hand, hang back a little.
