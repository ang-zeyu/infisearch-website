It was she herself, and the rascal was the young prince Rameri, who was yesterday forbidden this temple.\"  \"Oho!\"  cried the old master of the hunt.  \"Oho! my lord!  Is this the way to speak of the children of the king?\"  Others of the company who were attached to Pharaoh's family expressed their indignation; but Ameni whispered to Paaker--\"Say no more!\" then he continued aloud:  \"You never were careful in weighing your words, my friend, and now, as it seems to me, you are speaking in the heat of fever.  Come here, Gagabu, and examine Paaker's wound, which is no disgrace to him--for it was inflicted by a prince.\"  The old man loosened the bandage from the pioneer's swollen hand.  \"That was a bad blow,\" he exclaimed; \"three fingers are broken, and--do you see?--the emerald too in your signet ring.\"  Paaker looked down at his aching fingers, and uttered a sigh of rehef, for it was not the oracular ring with the name of Thotmes III., but the valuable one given to his father by the reigning king that had been crushed.  Only a few solitary fragments of the splintered stone remained in the setting; the king's name had fallen to pieces, and disappeared. Paaker's bloodless lips moved silently, and an inner voice cried out to him: \"The Gods point out the way!  The name is gone, the bearer of the name must follow.\"  \"It is a pity about the ring,\" said Gagabu.  \"And if the hand is not to follow it--luckily it is your left hand--leave off drinking, let yourself be taken to Nebsecht the surgeon, and get him to set the joints neatly, and bind them up.\"  Paaker rose, and went away after Ameni had appointed to meet him on the following day at the Temple of Seti, and the Regent at the palace.  When the door had closed behind him, the treasurer of the temple said:  \"This has been a bad day for the Mohar, and perhaps it will teach him that here in Thebes he cannot swagger as he does in the field.  Another adventure occurred to him to-day; would you like to hear it?\"  \"Yes; tell it!\"  cried the guests.  \"You all knew old Seni,\" began the treasurer.  \"He was a rich man, but he gave away all his goods to the poor, after his seven blooming sons, one after another, had died in the war, or of illness.  He only kept a small house with a little garden, and said that as the Gods had taken his children to themselves in the other world he would take pity on the forlorn in this.  'Feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked' says the law; and now that Seni has nothing more to give away, he goes through the city, as you know, hungry and thirsty himself, and scarcely clothed, and begging for his adopted children, the poor.  We have all given to him, for we all know for whom he humbles himself, and holds out his hand.  To-day he went round with his little bag, and begged, with his kind good eyes, for alms.  Paaker has given us a good piece of arable land, and thinks, perhaps with reason, that he has done his part.  When Seni addressed him, he told him to go; but the old man did not give up asking him, he followed him persistently to the grave of his father, and a great many people with him.  Then the pioneer pushed him angrily back, and when at last the beggar clutched his garment, he raised his whip, and struck him two or three times, crying out: 'There- that is your portion!'  The good old man bore it quite patiently, while he untied the bag, and said with tears in his eyes: 'My portion--yes-- but not the portion of the poor!'  \"I was standing near, and I saw how Paaker hastily withdrew into the tomb, and how his mother Setchem threw her full purse to Seni.  Others followed her example, and the old man never had a richer harvest.  The poor may thank the Mohar!  A crowd of people collected in front of the tomb, and he would have fared badly if it had not been for the police guard who drove them away.\"  During this narrative, which was heard with much approval--for no one is more secure of his result than he who can tell of the downfall of a man who is disliked for his arrogance--the Regent and the high-priest had been eagerly whispering to each other.  \"There can be no doubt,\" said Ameni, that Bent-Anat did actually come to the festival.\"  \"And had also dealings with the priest whom you so warmly defend,\" whispered the other.  \"Pentaur  shall  be  questioned this very night,\" returned the high- priest.  \"The dishes will soon be taken away, and the drinking will begin.  Let us go and hear what the poet says.\"  \"But there are now no witnesses,\" replied Ani.  \"We do not need them,\" said Ameni.  \"He is incapable of a lie.\"  \"Let us go then,\" said the Regent smiling, \"for I am really curious about this white negro, and how he will come to terms with the truth.  You have forgotten that there is a woman in the case.\"  \"That there always is!\"  answered Ameni; he called Gagabu to him, gave him his seat, begged him to keep up the flow of cheerful conversation, to encourage the guests to drink, and to interrupt all talk of the king, the state, or the war.  \"You know,\" he concluded, \"that we are not by ourselves this evening. Wine has, before this, betrayed everything!  Remember this--the mother of foresight looks backwards!\"  Ani clapped his hand on the old man's shoulder.  \"There will be a space cleared to-night in your winelofts.  It is said of you that you cannot bear to see either a full glass or an empty one; to-night give your aversion to both free play.  And when you think it is the right moment, give a sign to my steward, who is sitting there in the corner.  He has a few jars of the best liquor from Byblos, that he brought over with him, and he will bring it to you.  I will come in again and bid you good- night.\"  Ameni was accustomed to leave the hall at the beginning of the drinking.  When the door was closed behind him and his companion, when fresh rose- garlands had been brought for the necks of the company, when lotus blossoms decorated their heads, and the beakers were refilled, a choir of musicians came in, who played on harps, lutes, flutes, and small drums. The conductor beat the time by clapping his hands, and when the music had raised the spirits of the drinkers, they seconded his efforts by rhythmical clippings.  The jolly old Gagabu kept up his character as a stout drinker, and leader of the feast.  The most priestly countenances soon beamed with cheerfulness, and the officers and courtiers outdid each other in audacious jokes.  Then the old man signed to a young temple-servant, who wore a costly wreath; he came forward with a small gilt image of a mummy, carried it round the circle and cried:  \"Look at this, be merry and drink so long as you are on earth, for soon you must be like this.\"       [A custom mentioned by Herodotus.  Lucian saw such an image brought      in at a feast.  The Greeks adopted the idea, but beautified it,      using a winged Genius of death instead of a mummy.  The Romans also      had their \"larva.\"]  Gagabu gave another signal, and the Regent's steward brought in the wine from Byblos.  Ani was much lauded for the wonderful choiceness of the liquor.  \"Such wine,\" exclaimed the usually grave chief of the pastophori, \"is like soap.\"       [This comparison is genuinely Eastern.  Kisra called wine \"the soap      of sorrow.\"  The Mohammedans, to whom wine is forbidden, have      praised it like the guests of the House of Seti.  Thus Abdelmalik      ibn Salih Haschimi says: \"The best thing the world enjoys is wine.\"      Gahiz says: \"When wine enters thy bones and flows through thy limbs      it bestows truth of feeling, and perfects the soul; it removes      sorrow, elevates the mood, etc., etc.\"  When Ibn 'Aischah was told      that some one drank no wine, he said: \"He has thrice disowned the      world.\"  Ibn el Mu'tazz sang:       \"Heed not time, how it may linger, or how swiftly take its flight,      Wail thy sorrows only to the wine before thee gleaming bright.      But when thrice thou st drained the beaker watch and ward          keep o'er thy heart.      Lest the foam of joy should vanish, and thy soul with anguish smart,      This for every earthly trouble is a sovereign remedy,      Therefore listen to my counsel, knowing what will profit thee,      Heed not time, for ah, how many a man has longed in pain      Tale of evil days to lighten--and found all his longing vain.\"                          --Translated by Mary J. Safford.]  \"What a simile!\"  cried Gagabu.  \"You must explain it.\"  \"It cleanses the soul of sorrow,\" answered the other.  \"Good, friend!\" they all exclaimed.  \"Now every one in turn shall praise the noble juice in some worthy saying.\"  \"You begin--the chief prophet of the temple of Atnenophis.\"  \"Sorrow is a poison,\" said the priest, \"and wine is the antidote.\"  \"Well said!--go on; it is your turn, my lord privy councillor.\"  \"Every thing has its secret spring,\" said the official, \"and wine is the secret of joy.\"  \"Now you, my lord keeper of the seal.\"  \"Wine seals the door on discontent, and locks the gates on sorrow.\"  \"That it does, that it certainly does!--Now the governor of Hermothis, the oldest of all the company.\"  \"Wine ripens especially for us old folks, and not for you young people.\"  \"That you must explain,\" cried a voice from the table of the military officers.  \"It makes young men of the old,\" laughed the octogenarian, \"and children of the young.\"  \"He has you there, you youngsters,\" cried Gagabu.  \"What have you to say, Septah?\"  \"Wine is a poison,\" said the morose haruspex, \"for it makes fools of wise men.\"  \"Then you have little to fear from it, alas!\"  said Gagabu laughing. \"Proceed, my lord of the chase.\"  \"The rim of the beaker,\" was the answer, \"is like the lip of the woman you love.  Touch it, and taste it, and it is as good as the kiss of a bride.\"  \"General--the turn is yours.\"  \"I wish the Nile ran with such wine instead of with water,\" cried the soldier, \"and that I were as big as the colossus of Atnenophis, and that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5445"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 07 (#2)"],["body","biggest obelisk of Hatasu  were my drinking vessel, and that I might drink as much as I would!  But now--what have you to say of this noble liquor, excellent Gagabu?\"  The second prophet raised his beaker, and gazed lovingly at the golden fluid; he tasted it slowly, and then said with his eyes turned to heaven:  \"I only fear that I am unworthy to thank the Gods for such a divine blessing.\"  \"Well said!\"  exclaimed the Regent Ani, who had re-entered the room unobserved.  \"If my wine could speak, it would thank you for such a speech.\"  \"Hail to the Regent Ani!\"  shouted the guests, and they all rose with their cups filled with his noble present.  He pledged them and then rose.  \"Those,\" said he, \"who have appreciated this wine, I now invite to dine with me to-morrow.  You will then meet with it again, and if you still find it to your liking, you will be heartily welcome any evening.  Now, good night, friends.\"  A thunder of applause followed him, as he quitted the room.  The morning was already grey, when the carousing-party broke up; few of the guests could find their way unassisted through the courtyard; most of them had already been carried away by the slaves, who had waited for them--and who took them on their heads, like bales of goods--and had been borne home in their litters; but for those who remained to the end, couches were prepared in the House of Seti, for a terrific storm was now raging.  While the company were filling and refilling the beakers, which raised their spirits to so wild a pitch, the prisoner Pentaur had been examined in the presence of the Regent.  Ameni's messenger had found the poet on his knees, so absorbed in meditation that he did not perceive his approach.  All his peace of mind had deserted him, his soul was in a tumult, and he could not succeed in obtaining any calm and clear control over the new life-pulses which were throbbing in his heart.  He had hitherto never gone to rest at night without requiring of himself an account of the past day, and he had always been able to detect the most subtle line that divided right from wrong in his actions.  But to-night he looked back on a perplexing confusion of ideas and events, and when he endeavored to sort them and arrange them, he could see nothing clearly but the image of Bent-Anat, which enthralled his heart and intellect.  He had raised his hand against his fellow-men, and dipped it in blood, he desired to convince himself of his sin, and to repent but he could not; for each time he recalled it, to blame and condemn himself, he saw the soldier's hand twisted in Uarda's hair, and the princess's eyes beaming with approbation, nay with admiration, and he said to himself that he had acted rightly, and in the same position would do the same again to-morrow.  Still he felt that he had broken through all the conditions with which fate had surrounded his existence, and it seemed to him that he could never succeed in recovering the still, narrow, but peaceful life of the past.  His soul went up in prayer to the Almighty One, and to the spirit of the sweet humble woman whom he had called his mother, imploring for peace of mind and modest content; but in vain--for the longer he remained prostrate, flinging up his arms in passionate entreaty, the keener grew his longings, the less he felt able to repent or to recognize his guilt. Ameni's order to appear before him came almost as a deliverance, and he followed the messenger prepared for a severe punishment; but not afraid --almost joyful.  In obedience to the command of the grave high-priest, Pentaur related the whole occurrence--how, as there was no leech in the house, he had gone with the old wife of the paraschites to visit her possessed husband; how, to save the unhappy girl from ill-usage by the mob, he had raised his hand in fight, and dealt indeed some heavy blows.  \"You have killed four men,\" said Ameni, \"and severely wounded twice as many.  Why did you not reveal yourself as a priest, as the speaker of the morning's discourse?  Why did you not endeavor to persuade the people with words of warning, rather than with brute force?\"  \"I had no priest's garment,\" replied Pentaur.  \"There again you did wrong,\" said Ameni, \"for you know that the law requires of each of us never to leave this house without our white robes.  But you cannot pretend not to know your own powers of speech, nor to contradict me when I assert that, even in the plainest working-dress, you were perfectly able to produce as much effect with words as by deadly blows!\" \"I might very likely have succeeded,\" answered Pentaur, \"but the most savage temper ruled the crowd; there was no time for reflection, and when I struck down the villain, like some reptile, who had seized the innocent girl, the lust of fighting took possession of me.  I cared no more for my own life, and to save the child I would have slain thousands.\"  \"Your eyes sparkle,\" said Ameni, \"as if you had performed some heroic feat; and yet the men you killed were only unarmed and pious citizens, who were roused to indignation by a gross and shameless outrage.  I cannot conceive whence the warrior-spirit should have fallen on a gardener's son--and a minister of the Gods.\"  \"It is true,\" answered Pentaur, \"when the crowd rushed upon me, and I drove them back, putting out all my strength, I felt something of the warlike rage of the soldier, who repulses the pressing foe from the standard committed to his charge.  It was sinful in a priest, no doubt, and I will repent of it--but I felt it.\"  \"You felt it--and you will repent of it, well and good,\" replied Ameni. \"But you have not given a true account of all that happened.  Why have you concealed that Bent-Anat--Rameses' daughter--was mixed up in the fray, and that she saved you by announcing her name to the people, and commanding them to leave you alone?  When you gave her the lie before all the people, was it because you did not believe that it was Bent-Anat? Now, you who stand so firmly on so high a platform--now you standard- bearer of the truth answer me.\"  Pentaur had turned pale at his master's words, and said, as he looked at the Regent:  \"We are not alone.\"  \"Truth is one!\"  said Ameni coolly.  \"What ycu can reveal to me, can also be heard by this noble lord, the Regent of the king himself.  Did you recognize Bent-Anat, or not?\"  \"The lady who rescued me was like her, and yet unlike,\" answered the poet, whose blood was roused by the subtle irony of his Superior's words. \"And if I had been as sure that she was the princess, as I am that you are the man who once held me in honor, and who are now trying to humiliate me, I would all the more have acted as I did to spare a lady who is more like a goddess than a woman, and who, to save an unworthy wretch like me, stooped from a throne to the dust.\"  \"Still the poet--the preacher!\"  said Ameni.  Then he added severely. \"I beg for a short and clear an swer.  We know for certain that the princess took part in the festival in the disguise of a woman of low rank, for she again declared herself to Paaker; and we know that it was she who saved you.  But did you know that she meant to come across the Nile?\"  \"How should I?\"  asked Pentaur.  \"Well, did you believe that it was Bent-Anat whom you saw before you when she ventured on to the scene of conflict?\"  \"I did believe it,\" replied Pentaur; he shuddered and cast down his eyes.  \"Then it was most audacious to drive away the king's daughter as an impostor.\"  \"It was,\" said Pentaur.  \"But for my sake she had risked the honor of her name, and that of her royal father, and I--I should not have risked my life and freedom for--\"  \"We have heard enough,\" interrupted Ameni.  \"Not so,\" the Regent interposed. \"What became of the girl you had saved?\"  \"An old witch, Hekt by name, a neighbor of Pinem's, took her and her grandmother into her cave,\" answered the poet; who was then, by the high- priest's order, taken back to the temple-prison.  Scarcely had he disappeared when the Regent exclaimed:  \"A dangerous man! an enthusiast! an ardent worshipper of Rameses!\"  \"And of his daughter,\" laughed Ameni, but only a worshipper.  Thou hast nothing to fear from him--I will answer for the purity of his motives.\"  \"But he is handsome and of powerful speech,\" replied Ani.  \"I claim him as my prisoner, for he has killed one of my soldiers.\"  Ameni's countenance darkened, and he answered very sternly:  \"It is the exclusive right of our conclave, as established by our charter, to judge any member of this fraternity.  You, the future king, have freely promised to secure our privileges to us, the champions of your own ancient and sacred rights.\"  \"And you shall have them,\" answered the Regent with a persuasive smile. \"But this man is dangerous, and you would not have him go unpunished.\"  \"He shall be severely judged,\" said Ameni, \"but by us and in this house.\"  \"He has committed murder!\"  cried Ani.  \"More than one murder.  He is worthy of death.\"  \"He acted under pressure of necessity,\" replied Ameni.  \"And a man so favored by the Gods as he, is not to be lightly given up because an untimely impulse of generosity prompted him to rash conduct.  I know-- I can see that you wish him ill.  Promise me, as you value me as an ally, that you will not attempt his life.\"  \"Oh, willingly!\"  smiled the Regent, giving the high-priest his hand.  \"Accept my sincere thanks,\" said Ameni.  \"Pentaur was the most promising of my disciples, and in spite of many aberrations I still esteem him highly.  When he was telling us of what had occurred to-day, did he not remind you of the great Assa, or of his gallant son, the Osirian father of the pioneer Paaker?\"  \"The likeness  is  extraordinary,\" answered Ani, \"and yet he is of quite humble birth.  Who was his mother?\"  \"Our gate-keeper's daughter, a plain, pious, simple creature.\"  \"Now I will return to the banqueting hall,\" said Ani, after a fete moments of reflection.  \"But I must ask you one thing more.  I spoke "]]]
