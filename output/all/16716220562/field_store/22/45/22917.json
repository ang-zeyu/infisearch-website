Still, he could not and he would not succumb in this struggle.  Time pressed.  Long reflection was impossible; suddenly he felt carried away by a fierce and mad longing to fight it out--he felt as he had felt on. a race-day in the hippodrome, when he had driven his own quadriga ahead of all the rest.  Onwards, then, onwards; and if the chariot were wrecked, if the horses were killed, if his wheels maimed his comrades overthrown in the arena- still, onwards, onwards!  A few hasty steps brought him to the lodge of the gate-keeper, a sturdy old man who had held his post for forty years.  He had formerly been a locksmith and it still was part of his duty to undertake the repairs of the simple household utensils.  Orion as a youth had been a beautiful and engaging boy and a great favorite with this worthy man; he had delighted in sitting in his little room and handing him the tools for his work. He himself had remarkable mechanical facility and had been the old man's apt pupil; nay, he had made such progress as to be able to carve pretty little boxes, prayer-book cases, and such like, and provide them with locks, as gifts to his parents on their birth days--a festival always kept with peculiar solemnity in Egypt, and marked by giving and receiving presents.  He understood the use of tools, and he now hastily selected such as he needed.  On the window-ledge stood a bunch of flowers which he had ordered for Paula the day before, and which he had forgotten to fetch this terrible morning.  With this in one hand, and the tools in the breast of his robe he hastened upstairs.  \"Onwards, I must keep on!\"  he muttered, as he entered Paula's room, bolted the door inside and, kneeling before her chest, tossed the flowers aside.  If he was discovered, he would say that he had gone into his cousin's chamber to give her the bouquet.  \"Onwards; I must go on!\"  was still his thought, as he unscrewed the hinge on which the lid of the trunk moved.  His hands trembled, his breath came fast, but he did his task quickly.  This was the right way to work, for the lock was a peculiar one, and could not have been opened without spoiling it.  He raised the lid, and the first thing his hand came upon in the chest was the necklace with the empty medallion--it was as though some kind Genius were aiding him.  The medallion hung but slightly to the elegantly-wrought chain; to detach it and conceal it about his person was the work of a minute.  But now the most resolute.  \"On, on. . . .\"  was of no further avail. This was theft: he had robbed her whom, if she only had chosen it, he was ready to load with everything wherewith fate had so superabundantly blessed him.  No, this--this....  A singular idea suddenly flashed through his brain; a thought which brought a smile to his lips even at this moment of frightful tension. He acted upon it forth with: he drew out from within his under-garment a gem that hung round his neck by a gold chain.  This jewel--a masterpiece by one of the famous Greek engravers of heathen antiquity--had been given him in Constantinople in exchange for a team of four horses to which his greatest friend there had taken a fancy.  It was in fact of greater price than half a dozen fine horses.  Half beside himself, and as if intoxicated, Orion followed the wild impulse to which he had yielded; indeed, he was glad to have so precious a jewel at hand to hang in the place of the worthless gold frame-work.  It was done with a pinch; but screwing up the hinge again was a longer task, for his hands trembled violently--and as the moment drew near in which he meant to let Paula feel his power, the more quickly his heart beat, and the more difficult he found it to control his mind to calm deliberation.  After he had unbolted the door he stood like a thief spying the long corridor of the strangers' wing, and this increased his excitement to a frenzy of rage with the world, and fate, and most of all with her who had compelled him to stoop to such base conduct.  But now the charioteer had the reins and goad in his hand.  Onwards now, onwards!  He flew down stairs, three steps at a time, as he had been wont when a boy.  In the anteroom he met Eudoxia, Mary's Greek governess, who had just brought her refractory pupil into the house, and he tossed her the nosegay he still held in his hands; then, without heeding the languishing glances the middle-aged damsel sent after him with her thanks, he hastened back to the gate-keeper's lodge where he hurriedly disburdened himself of the locksmith's tools.  A few minutes later he entered the judgment-hall.  Nilus the treasurer showed him to the governor's raised seat, but an overpowering bashfulness kept him from taking this position of honor.  It was with a burning brow, and looks so ominously dark that the assembly gazed at him with timid astonishment, that he opened the proceedings with a few broken sentences. He himself scarcely knew what he was saying, and heard his own voice as vaguely as though it were the distant roar of waves.  However, he succeeded in clearly stating all that had happened: he showed the assembly the stone which had been stolen and recovered; he explained how the thief had been taken; he declared Paula's freedman to be guilty of the robbery, and called upon him to bring forward anything he could in his own defence.  But the accused could only stammer out that he was not guilty.  He was not able to defend himself, but his mistress could no doubt give evidence that would justify him.  Orion pushed the hair from his forehead, proudly raised his aching head, and addressed the judges:  \"His mistress is a lady of rank allied to our house.  Let us keep her out of this odious affair as is but seemly.  Her nurse gave Nilus some information which may perhaps avail to save this unhappy man.  We will neglect nothing to that end; but you, who are less familiar with the leading circumstances, must bear this in mind to guard yourselves against being misled:  This lady is much attached to the accused; she clings to him and Perpetua as the only friends remaining to her from her native home.  Moreover, there is nothing to surprise me or you in the fact that a noble woman, as she is, should assume the onus of another's crime, and place herself in a doubtful light to save a man who has hitherto been honest and faithful.  The nurse is here; shall she be called, or have you, Nilus, heard from her everything that her mistress can say in favor of her freedman?\"  \"Perpetua told me, and told you, too, my lord, certain credible facts,\" replied the treasurer.  \"But I could not repeat them so exactly as she herself, and I am of opinion that the woman should be brought before the court.\"  \"Then call her,\" said Orion, fixing his eyes on vacancy above the heads of the assembly, with a look of sullen dignity.  After a long and anxious pause the old woman was brought in.  Confident in her righteous cause she came forward boldly; she blamed Hiram somewhat sharply for keeping silence so long, and then explained that Paula, to procure money for her search for her father, had made the freedman take a costly emerald out of its setting in her necklace, and that it was the sale of this gem that had involved her fellow-countryman in this unfortunate suspicion.  The nurse's deposition seemed to have biased the greater part of the council in favor of the accused; but Orion did not give them time to discuss their impressions among themselves.  Hardly had Perpetua ceased speaking, when Orion took up the emerald, which was lying on the table before him, exclaiming excitedly, nay, angrily:  \"And the stone which is recognized by the man who sold it--an expert in gems--as being that which was taken from the hanging, and unique of its kind, is supposed, by some miracle of nature, to have suddenly appeared in duplicate?--Malignant spirits still wander through the world, but would hardly dare to play their tricks in this Christian house.  You all know what 'old women's tales' are; and the tale that old woman has told us is one of the most improbable of its class.  'Tell that to Apelles the Jew,' said Horace the Roman; but his fellow-Israelite, Gamaliel'--and he turned to the jeweller who was sitting with the other witnesses will certainly not believe it; still less I, who see through this tissue of falsehood.  The daughter of the noble Thomas has condescended to weave it with the help of that woman--a skilled weaver, she--to spread it before us in order to mislead us, and so to save her faithful servant from imprisonment, from the mines, or from death.  These are the facts.--Do I err, woman, or do you still adhere to your statement?\"  The nurse, who had hoped to find in Orion her mistress' advocate, had listened to his speech with growing horror.  Her eyes flashed as she looked at him, first with mockery and then with vehement disgust; but, though they filled with tears at this unlooked-for attack, she preserved her presence of mind, and declared she had spoken the truth, and nothing but the truth, as she always did.  The setting of her mistress' emerald would prove her statement.  Orion shrugged his shoulders, desired the woman to fetch her mistress, whose presence was now indispensable, and called to the treasurer:  \"Go with her, Nilus!  And let a servant bring the trunk here that the owner may open it in the presence of us all and before any one else touches the contents.  I should not be the right person to undertake it since no one in this Jacobite household--hardly even one of yourselves-- has found favor in the eyes of the Melchite.  She has unfortunately a special aversion for me, so I must depute to others every proceeding that could lead to a misunderstanding.--Conduct her hither, Nilus; of course with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5519"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 03 (#8)"],["body","respect due to a maiden of high rank.\"  While the envoy was gone Orion paced the room with swift, restless steps, Once only he paused and addressed the judges:  \"But supposing the empty setting should be found, how do you account for the existence of two--two gems, each unique of its kind?  It is distracting.  Here is a soft-hearted girl daring to mislead a serious council of justice for the sake, for the sake of. . . .\"  he stamped his foot with rage and continued his silent march.  \"He is as yet but a beginner,\" thought the assembled officials as they watched his agitation.  \"Otherwise how could he allow such an absurd attempt to clear an accused thief to affect him so deeply, or disturb his temper?\"  Paula's arrival presently put an end to Orion's pacing the room.  He received her with a respectful bow and signed to her to be seated.  Then he bid Nilus recapitulate the results of the proceedings up to the present stage, and what he and his colleagues supposed to be her motive for asserting that the stolen emerald was her property.  He would as far as possible leave it to the others to question her, since she knew full well on what terms she was with himself.  Even before he had come into the council-room she had offered her explanation of the robbery to Nilus, through her nurse Perpetua; but it would have seemed fairer and more friendly in his eyes--and here he raised his voice--if she had chosen to confide to him, Orion, her plan for helping the freedman.  Then he might have been able to warn her.  He could only regard this mode of action, independently of him, as a fresh proof of her dislike, and she must hold herself responsible for the consequences.  Justice must now take its course with inexorable rigor.  The wrathful light in his eyes showed her what she had to expect from him, and that he was prepared to fight her to the end.  She saw that he thought that she had broken the promise she had but just now given him; but she had not commissioned Perpetua to interfere in the matter; on the contrary, she had desired the woman to leave it to her to produce her evidence only in the last extremity.  Orion must believe that she had done him a wrong; still, could that make him so far forget himself as to carry out his threats, and sacrifice an innocent man--to divert suspicion from himself, while he branded her as a false witness?  Aye, even from that he would not shrink!  His flaming glance, his abrupt demeanor, his laboring breath, proclaimed it plainly enough.--Then let the struggle begin!  At this moment she would have died rather than have tried to mollify him by a word of excuse.  The turmoil in his whole being vibrated through hers.  She was ready to throw herself at his feet and implore him to control himself, to guard himself against further wrong-doing--but she maintained her proud dignity, and the eyes that met his were not less indignant and defiant than his own.  They stood face to face like two young eagles preparing to fight, with feathers on end, arching their pinions and stretching their necks.  She, confident of victory in the righteousness of her cause, and far more anxious for him than for herself; he, almost blind to his own danger, but, like a gladiator confronting his antagonist in the arena, far more eager to conquer than to protect his own life and limb.  While Nilus explained to her what, in part, she already knew, and repeated their suspicion that she had been tempted to make a false declaration to save the life of her servant, whose devotion, no doubt, to his missing master had led him to commit the robbery; she kept her eye on Orion rather than on the speaker.  At last Nilus referred to the trunk, which had been brought from Paula's room under her own eyes, informing her that the assembly were ready to hear and examine into anything she had to say in her own defence.  Orion's agitation rose to its highest pitch.  He felt that the blood had fled from his cheeks, and his thoughts were in utter confusion.  The council, the accused, his enemy Paula--everything in the room lay before him shrouded in a whirl of green mist.  All he saw seemed to be tinted with light emerald green.  The hair, the faces, the dresses of those present gleamed and floated in a greenish light; and not till Paula went up to the chest with a firm, haughty step, drew out a small key, gave it to the treasurer, and answered his speech with three words: \"Open the box!\"--uttering them with cold condescension as though even this were too much--not till then did he see clearly once more: her bright brown hair, the fire of her blue eyes, the rose and white of her complexion, the light dress which draped her fine figure in noble folds, and her triumphant smile.  How beautiful, how desirable was this woman!  A few minutes and she would be worsted in this contest; but the triumph had cost him not only herself, but all that was good and pure in his soul, and worthy of his forefathers.  An inward voice cried it out to him, but he drowned it in the shout of \"Onwards,\" like a chariot-driver.  Yes--on; still on towards the goal; away over ruins and stones, through blood and dust, till she bowed her proud neck, crushed and beaten, and sued for mercy.  The lid of the trunk flew open.  Paula stooped, lifted the necklace, held it out to the judges, pulling it straight by the two ends....  Ah! what a terrible, heartrending cry of despair!  Orion even, never, never wished to hear the like again.  Then she flung the jewel on the table, exclaiming: \"Shameful, shameful!  atrocious!\"  she tottered backwards and clung to her faithful Betta; for her knees were giving way, and she felt herself in danger of sinking to the ground.  Orion sprang forward to support her, but she thrust him aside, with a glance so full of anguish, rage and intense contempt that he stood motionless, and clasped his hand over his heart.--And this deed, which was to work such misery for two human beings, he had smiled in doing! This practical joke which concealed a death-warrant--to what fearful issues might it not lead?  Paula had sunk speechless on to a seat, and he stood staring in silence, till a burst of laughter broke from the assembly and old Psamtik, the captain of the guard, who had long been a member of the council of justice, exclaimed:  \"By my soul, a splendid stone!  There is the heathen god Eros with his winged sweetheart Psyche smiling in his face.  Did you never read that pretty story by Apuleius--'The Golden Ass' it is called?  The passage is in that.  Holy Luke!  how finely it is carved.  The lady has taken out the wrong necklace.  Look, Gamaliel, where could your green pigeon's egg have found a place in that thing?\"  and he pointed to the gem.  \"Nowhere,\" said the Jew.  \"The noble lady.  .  .\"  But Orion roughly bid the witness to be silent, and Nilus, taking up the engraved gem, examined it closely.  Then he--he the grave, just man, on whose support Paula had confidently reckoned--went up to her and with a regretful shrug asked her whether the other necklace with the setting of which she had spoken was in the trunk.  The blood ran cold in her veins.  This thing that had happened was as startling as a miracle.  But no!  No higher Power had anything to do with this blow.  Orion believed that she had failed in her promise of screening him by her silence, and this, this was his revenge.  By what means--how he had gone to work, was a mystery.  What a trick!--and it had succeeded!  But should she take it like a patient child?  No.  A thousand times no!  Suddenly all her old powers of resistance came back; hatred steeled her wavering will; and, as in fancy, he had seen himself in the circus, driving in a race, so she pictured herself seated at the chess- board.  She felt herself playing with all her might to win; but not, as with his father, for flowers, trifling presents or mere glory; nay, for a very different stake Life or Death!  She would do everything, anything to conquer him; and yet, no--come what might--not everything.  Sooner would she succumb than betray him as the thief or reveal what she had discovered in the viridarium.  She had promised to keep the secret; and she would repay the father's kindness by screening the son from this disgrace.  How beautiful, how noble had Orion's image been in her heart.  She would not stain it with this disgrace in her own eyes and in those of the world.  But every other reservation must be cast far, far away, to snatch the victory from him and to save Hiram.  Every fair weapon she might use; only this treachery she could not, might not have recourse to.  He must be made to feel that she was more magnanimous than he; that she, under all conceivable circumstances, kept her word.  That was settled; her bosom once more rose and fell, and her eye brightened again; still it was some little time before she could find the right words with which to begin the contest.  Orion could see the seething turmoil in her soul; he felt that she was arming herself for resistance, and he longed to spur her on to deal the first blow.  Not a word had she uttered of surprise or anger, not a syllable of reproach had passed her lips.  What was she thinking of, what was she plotting?  The more startling and dangerous the better; the more bravely she bore herself, the more completely in the background might he leave the painful sense of fighting against a woman.  Even heroes had boasted of a victory over Amazons.  At last, at last!--She rose and went towards Hiram.  He had been tied to the stake to which criminals were bound, and as an imploring glance from his honest eyes met hers, the spell that fettered her tongue was unloosed; she suddenly understood that she had not merely to protect herself, but to fulfil a solemn duty.  With a few rapid steps she went up to the table at which her judges sat in a semi-circle, and leaning on it with her left hand, raised her right high in the air, exclaiming:  \"You are the victims of a cruel"]]]
