God Almighty was plaguing them and the land with great heat; but this was like the cool north wind at Advent-tide, as compared with the fierceness of the furnace of hell which Satan was making hot for them.  The scorching sun on earth at any rate gave them daylight, but the flames of hell shed no light, that the terrors might never cease of those whom the devil's myrmidons drove over the narrow bridge leading to his horrible realm, goading them with spears and pitchforks, with heavy cudgelling or gnawing of their flesh.  In the anguish of death, and the crush by the way, mothers trod down their infants and fathers their daughters; and when the damned reached the spiked threshold of hell itself, a hideous and poisoned vapor rose up to meet them, choking them, and yet giving them renewed strength to feel fresh torments with increased keenness of every sense.  Then the devil's shrieks of anguish, which shake the vault of hell, came thundering on their ears; with hideous yells he snatched at them from the grate on which he lay, crushed and squeezed them in his iron jaws like a bunch of grapes, and swallowed them into his fiery maw; or else they were hung up by their tongues by attendant friends in Satan's fiery furnace, or dragged alternately through ice and flames, and finally beaten to pieces on the anvil of hell, or throttled and wrung with ropes and cloths.--As compared with the torments they would suffer there, every present anxiety was as the kiss of a lover.  Mothers would hear the brain seething in their infants' skulls....  At this point of the monk's grewsome discourse, Orion turned away with a shudder.  The curse with which the patriarch had threatened him recurred to his mind; he could have fancied that the hot, stuffy, incense-laden air of the church was full of flapping daws and hideous bats.  Deadly horror crept over him; but then, suddenly, the rebound came of youthful vigor, longing for freedom and joy in living; a voice within cried out: \"Away with coercion and chains!  Winged spirit, use your pinions!  Down with the god of terrors!  He is not that Heavenly Father whose love embraces mankind.  Forward, leap up and be free!  Trusting in your own strength, guided by your own will, go boldly forth into the open sunshine of life!  Be free, be free!--Still, be not like a slave who is no sooner cut adrift and left to himself than he falls a slave again to his own senses.  No; but striving unceasingly and of your own free will, in the sweat of your brow, to reach the high goal, to work out to its fulfilment and fruition everything that is best in your soul and mind.  Yes--life is a ministry....  I, like the disciples of the Stoa, will strive after all that is known as virtue, with no other end in view than to practise it for its own sake, because it is fair and gives unmixed joys.  I will rely on myself to seek the truth--and do what I feel to be right and good; this, henceforth, shall be the lofty aim of my existence.  To the two chief desires of my heart--: atonement to my father and union with Paula, I here add a third: the attainment of the loftiest goal that I may reach, by valiant striving to get as near to it as my strength will allow.  The road thither is by Work; the guiding star I must keep before me that I may not go astray is my Love!\"  His cheeks were burning, and with a deep breath he looked about him as though to find an adversary with whom he might measure his strength.  The horrible sermon was ended and the words of the chanting crowd fell on his ear.  \"Lord, reward me not according to mine iniquities!\"  The load of his own sin fell on his heart again, and his dying father's curse; his proud head drooped on his breast, and he said to himself that his burthen was too heavy for him to venture on the bold flight for which he had but now spread his wings.  The ban was not yet lifted; he was not yet redeemed from its crushing weight.  But the mere word \"redeemed\" brought to his mind the image of Him who took on Himself the sins of the world; and the more deeply he contemplated the nature of the Saviour whom he had loved from his childhood, the more surely he felt that it would be doing no violence to the freedom of his own will, but rather be the fulfilment of a long-felt desire, if he were to tell Jesus simply all that oppressed him; that his love for Him, his faith in Him, had a saving power even for his soul.  He lifted up his eyes and heart to Him, and to Him, as to a trusted friend, confided all that troubled and hindered him and besought His aid.  In loving Him, he and Paula were one, he knew, though they had not the same idea of His nature.  Orion, as he meditated, thought out the points on which her views deviated from his own: she believed that the divine and the human natures were distinct in the person of Christ.  And as he reflected on this creed, till now so horrible in his eyes, he felt that the unique individuality of the Saviour, shedding forth love and truth, came home to him more closely when he pictured Him perfect and spotless, yet feeling as a man; walking among men with all their joy in life in His heart, alive to every pang and sorrow which can torture mortals, rejoicing with them, and taking upon Himself unspeakable humiliation, suffering, and death, with a stricken, bleeding, and yet self-devoting heart, for pure love of the wretched race to which He could stoop from His glory.  Yes, this Christ could be his Redeemer too.  The Almighty Lord had become his perfect and most loving friend, his glorious, but lenient and tender brother, to whom he could gladly give his whole heart, who understood everything, who was ready to forgive everything--even all that was seething in his aching heart which longed for purification--and all because He once had suffered as a man suffers.  For the first time he, the Jacobite, dared to confess so much to himself; and not solely for Paula's sake.  A violent clanging on a cracked metal plate roused him from his meditations by its harsh clamor; the sacrament of the Last Supper was about to be administered: the invariable conclusion of the Jacobite service.  The bishop came forth from behind the screen of the inner sanctuary, poured some wine into a silver cup and crumbled into it two little cakes stamped with the Coptic cross.  Of this mixture he first partook, and then gave it in a spoon to each member of the congregation who came up to receive it.  Orion approached after two elders of the Church.  Finally the priest rinsed out the cup, and drained the very washings, that no drop of the saving liquid should be lost.  How high had Orion's heart throbbed when, as a youth, he had been admitted for the first time to this most sacred of all Christian privileges!  He was instructed in its deep and glorious symbolism, and had often felt the purifying, saving, and refreshing effect of the sacrament, strengthening him in all goodness, when he had partaken of it with his parents and brothers.  Hand-in-hand, they had gone home feeling as if newly robed in body and soul and more closely bound together than before.  And to-day, insensible as he was to the repulsiveness of the forms of worship of his confession he felt as though the bread and wine --the Flesh and Blood of the Saviour--had sealed the bond he had silently entered into with himself; as though the Lord had put forth an invisible hand to remove the guilt and the curse that crushed him so sorely.  Deep devotion fell on his soul: his future life, he thought, should bring him nearer to God than ever before, and be spent in loving, and in the more earnest, full, and laborious exercise of the gifts Heaven had bestowed on him.     CHAPTER III.  Orion had dreaded the drive home with his mother, but after complaining to him of Susannah's conduct in having made a startling display of her vexation in the women's place behind the screen, she had leaned on him and fallen fast asleep.  Her head was on her son's shoulder when they reached home, and Orion's anxiety for the mother he truly loved was enhanced when he found it difficult to rouse her.  He felt her stagger like a drunken creature, and he led her not into the fountain-room but to her bed-chamber, where she only begged to lie down; and hardly had she done so when she was again overcome by sleep.  Orion now made his way to Gamaliel the jeweller, to purchase from him a very large and costly diamond, plainly set, and the Israelite's brother undertook to deliver it to the fair widow at Constantinople, who was known to him as one of his customers.  Orion, in the jeweller's sitting- room, wrote a letter to his former mistress, in which he begged her in the most urgent manner to accept the diamond, and in exchange to return to him the emerald by a swift and trustworthy messenger, whom Simeon the goldsmith would provide with everything needful.  After all this be went home hungry and weary, to the late midday meal which he shared, as for many days past, with no one but Eudoxia, Mary's governess.  The little girl was not yet allowed to leave her room, and of this, for one reason, her instructress was glad, for a dinner alone with the handsome youth brought extreme gratification to her mature heart. How considerate was the wealthy and noble heir in desiring the slaves to offer every dish to her first, how kind in listening to her stories of her young days and of the illustrious houses in which she had formerly given lessons!  She would have died for him; but, as no opportunity offered for such a sacrifice, at any rate she never omitted to point out to him the most delicate morsels, and to supply his room with fresh flowers.  Besides this, however, she had devoted herself with the most admirable unselfishness to her pupil, since the child had been ill and her grandmother had turned against her, noticing, too, that Orion took a tender and quite fatherly interest in his little niece.  This morning "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5523"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 07 (#5)"],["body","young man had not had time to enquire for Mary, and Eudoxia's report that she seemed even more excited than on the day before disturbed him so greatly, that he rose from table, in spite of Eudoxia's protest, without waiting till the end of the meal, to visit the little invalid.  It was with genuine anxiety that he mounted the stairs.  His heart was heavy over many things, and as he went towards the child's room he said to himself with a melancholy smile, that he, who had contemned many a distinguished man and many a courted fair one at Constantinople because they had fallen short of his lofty standard, had here no one but this child who would be sure to understand him.  Some minutes elapsed before his knock was answered with the request to 'come in,' and he heard a hasty bustle within.  He found Mary lying, as the physician had ordered, on a couch by the window, which was wide open and well-shaded; her couch was surrounded by flowering plants and, on a little table in front of her, were two large nosegays, one fading, the other quite fresh and particularly beautiful.  How sadly the child had changed in these few days.  The soft round cheeks had disappeared, and the pretty little face had sunk into nothingness by comparison with the wonderful, large eyes, which had gained in size and brilliancy.  Yesterday she had been free from fever and very pale, but to-day her cheeks were crimson, and a twitching of her lips and of her right shoulder, which had come on since the scene at the grandfather's deathbed, was so incessant that Orion sat down by her side in some alarm.  \"Has your grandmother been to see you?\"  was his first question, but the answer was a mournful shake of her head.  The blossoming plants were his own gift and so was the fading nosegay; the other, fresher one had not come from him, so he enquired who was the giver, and was not a little astonished to see his favorite's confusion and agitation at the question.  There must be something special connected with the posey, that was very evident, and the young man, who did not wish to excite her sensitive nerves unnecessarily, but could not recall his words, was wishing he had never spoken them, when the discovery of a feather fan cut the knot of his difficulty; he took it up, exclaiming: \"Hey--what have we here?\"  A deeper flush dyed Mary's cheek, and raising her large eyes imploringly to his face, she laid a finger on her lips.  He nodded, as understanding her, and said in a low voice:  \"Katharina has been here?  Susannah's gardener ties up flowers like that. The fan--when I knocked--she is here still perhaps?\"  He had guessed rightly; Mary pointed dumbly to the door of the adjoining room.  \"But, in Heaven's name, child,\" Orion went on, in an undertone, \"what does she want here?\"  \"She came by stealth, in the boat,\" whispered the child.  \"She sent Anubis from the treasurer's office to ask me if she might not come, she could not do without me any longer, and she never did me any harm and so I said yes--and then, when I knew it was your knock, whisk--off she went into the bedroom.\"  \"And if your grandmother were to come across her?\"  \"Then--well, then I do not know what would become of me!  But oh!  Orion, if you only knew how--how...\"  Two big tears rolled down her cheeks and Orion understood her; he stroked her hair lovingly and said in a whisper, glancing now and again at the door of the next room.  \"But I came up on purpose to tell you something more about Paula.  She sends you her love, and she invites you to go to her and stay with her, always.  But you must keep it quite a secret and tell no one, not even Eudoxia and Katharina; for I do not know myself how we can contrive to get your grandmother's consent.  At any rate we must set to work very prudently and cautiously, do you understand?  I have only taken you into our confidence that you may look forward to it and have something to be glad of at night, when you are such a silly little thing as to keep your eyes open like the hares, instead of sleeping like a good child.  If things go well, you may be with Paula to-morrow perhaps--think of that! I had quite given up all hope of managing it at all; but now, just now-- is it not odd--just within these two minutes I suddenly said to myself: 'It will come all right!'--So it must be done somehow.\"  A flood of tears streamed down Mary's burning cheeks but, freely as they flowed, she did not sob and her bosom did not heave.  Nor did she speak, but such pure and fervent gratitude and joy shone from her glistening eyes that Orion felt his own grow moist.  He was glad to find some way of concealing his emotion when Mary seized his hand and, pressing a long kiss on it, wetted it with her tears.  \"See!\"  he exclaimed.  \"All wet! as if I had just taken it out of the fountain.\"  But he said no more, for the bedroom door was suddenly thrown open and Eudoxia's high, thin voice was heard saying:  \"But why make any fuss?  Mary will be enchanted!  Here, Child, here is your long-lost friend!  Such a surprise!\"  And the water-wagtail, pushed forward by no gentle hand, appeared within the doorway.  Eudoxia was as radiant as though she had achieved some heroic deed; but she drew back a little when she found that Orion was still in the room.  The divided couple stood face to face.  What was done could not be undone; but, though he greeted her with only a calm bow, and she fluttered her fan with abrupt little jerks to conceal her embarrassment, nothing took place which could surprise the bystander; indeed, Katharina's pretty features assumed a defiant expression when he enquired how the little white dog was, and she coldly replied that she had had him chained up in the poultry-yard, for that the patriarch, who was their guest, could not endure dogs.  \"He honors a good many men with the same sentiments,\" replied Orion, but Katharina retorted, readily enough.  \"When they deserve it.\"  The dialogue went on in this key for some few minutes; but the young man was not in the humor either to take the young girl's pert stings or to repay her in the same coin; he rose to go but, before he could take leave, Katharina, observing from the window how low the sun was, cried: \"Mercy on me! how late it is--I must be off; I must not be absent at supper time.  My boat is lying close to yours in the fishing-cove.  I only hope the gate of the treasurer's house is still open.\"  Orion, too, looked at the sun and then remarked: \"To-day is Sanutius.\"  \"I know,\" said Katharina.  \"That is why Anubis was free at noon.\"  \"And for the same reason,\" added Orion, \"there is not a soul at work now in the office.\"  This was awkward.  Not for worlds would she have been seen in the house; and knowing, as she did from her games with Mary, every nook and corner of it, she began to consider her position.  Her delicate features assumed a sinister expression quite new to Orion, which both displeased him and roused his anxiety--not for himself but for Mary, who could certainly get no good from such a companion as this.  These visits must not be repeated very often; he would not allude to the subject in the child's presence, but Katharina should at once have a hint.  She could not get out of the place without his assistance; so he intruded on her meditations to inform her that he had the key of the office about him.  Then he went to see if the hall were empty, and led her at once to the treasurer's office through the various passages which connected it with the main buildings. The office at this hour was as lonely as the grave, and when Orion found himself standing with her, close to the door which opened on the road to the harbor, and had already raised the key to unlock it, he paused and for the first time broke the silence they had both preserved during their unpleasant walk, saying:  \"What brought you to see Mary, Katharina?  Tell me honestly.\"  Her heart, which had been beating high since she had found herself alone with him in the silent and deserted house, began to throb wildly; a great terror, she knew not of what, came over her.  \"She had come to the house for several reasons, but one had outweighed all the rest: Mary must be told that her young uncle and Paula were betrothed; for she knew by experience that the child could keep nothing of importance from her grandmother, and that Neforis had no love for Paula was an open secret.  As yet she certainly could know nothing of her son's formal suit, but if once she were informed of it she would do everything in her power--of this Katharina had not a doubt--to keep Orion and Paula apart.  So the girl had told Mary that it was already reported that they were a betrothed and happy pair, and that she herself had watched them making love in her neighbor's garden.  To her great annoyance, however, Mary took this all very coolly and without any special excitement.  \"So, when Orion enquired of his companion what had brought her to the governor's house, she could only reply that she longed so desperately to see little Mary.  \"Of course,\" said Orion.  \"But I must beg of you not to yield again to your affectionate impulse.  Your mother makes a public display of her grudge against mine, and her ill-feeling will only be increased if she is told that we are encouraging you to disregard her wishes.  Perhaps you may, ere long, have opportunities of seeing Mary more frequently; but, if that should be the case, I must especially request you not to talk of things that may agitate her.  You have seen for yourself how excitable she is and how fragile she looks.  Her little heart, her too precocious brain and feelings must have rest, must not be stirred and goaded by fresh incitements such as you are in a position to apply.  The patriarch is my enemy, the enemy of our house, and you--I do not say it to offend you--you overheard what he was saying last night, and probably gathered much important information, some of which may concern me and my family.\"  Katharina stood looking"]]]
