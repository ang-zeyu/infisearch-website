Seventy-two threads must be employed,      but black wool is prohibited.]  It is right that you should rejoice to see your brother again, but a king's daughter must never forget what is due to her rank, even in her greatest joy.  Go back to your mother directly.  I see your attendants waiting yonder.  Go and tell them, that as this is a day of rejoicing I will allow your heedless conduct to pass unpunished, but the next time you appear unbidden in these apartments, which none may enter without permission, I shall tell Boges to keep you twelve days in confinement. Remember this, thoughtless child, and tell our mother, Bartja and I are coming to visit her.  Now give me a kiss.  You will not?  We shall see, capricious little one!\"  And so saying the king sprang towards his refractory little sister, and seizing both her hands in one of his own, bent back her charming head with the other and kissed her in spite of her resistance.  She screamed from the violence of his grasp, and ran away crying to her attendants, who took her back to her apartments.  When Atossa had disappeared, Bartja said; \"You were too rough with the little one, Cambyses.  She screamed with pain!\"  Once more the king's face clouded, but suppressing the harsh words which trembled on his lips, he only answered, turning towards the house: \"Let us come to our mother now; she begged me to bring you as soon as you arrived.  The women, as usual, are all impatience.  Nitetis told me your rosy cheeks and fair curls had bewitched the Egyptian women too.  I would advise you to pray betimes to Mithras  for eternal youth, and for his protection against the wrinkles of age!\"  \"Do you mean to imply by these words that I have no virtues which could make an old age beautiful?\"  asked Bartja.  \"I explain my words to no one.  Come.\"  \"But I ask for an opportunity of proving, that I am inferior to none of my nation in manly qualities.\"  \"For that matter, the shouts of the Babylonians today will have been proof enough, that deeds are not wanted from you, in order to win their admiration.\"  \"Cambyses!\"  \"Now come!  We are just on the eve of a war with the Massagetae; there you will have a good opportunity of proving what you are worth.\"  A few minutes later, and Bartja was in the arms of his blind mother. She had been waiting for her darling's arrival with a beating heart, and in the joy of hearing his voice once more, and of being able to lay her hands again on that beloved head, she forgot everything else--even her first-born son who stood by smiling bitterly, as he watched the rich and boundless stream of a mother's love flowing out to his younger brother.  Cambyses had been spoiled from his earliest infancy.  Every wish had been fulfilled, every look regarded as a command; and thus he grew up totally unable to brook contradiction, giving way to the most violent anger if any of his subjects (and he knew no human beings who were not his subjects) dared to oppose him.  His father Cyrus, conqueror of half the world--the man whose genius had raised Persia from a small nation to the summit of earthly greatness--who had secured for himself the reverence and admiration of countless subjugated tribes--this great king was incapable of carrying out in his own small family-circle the system of education he had so successfully adopted towards entire countries.  He could see nought else in Cambyses but the future king of Persia, and commanded his subjects to pay him an unquestioning obedience, entirely forgetful of the fact that he who is to govern well must begin by learning to obey.  Cambyses had been the first-born son of Kassandane, the wife whom Cyrus had loved and married young; three daughters followed, and at last, fifteen years later, Bartja had come into the world.  Their eldest son had already outgrown his parents' caresses, when this little child appeared to engross all their care and love.  His gentle, affectionate and clinging nature made him the darling of both father and mother: Cambyses was treated with consideration by his parents, but their love was for Bartja.  Cambyses was brave; he distinguished himself often in the field, but his disposition was haughty and imperious; men served him with fear and trembling, while Bartja, ever sociable and sympathizing, converted all his companions into loving friends.  As to the mass of the people, they feared the king, and trembled when he drew near, notwithstanding the lavish manner in which he showered rich gifts around him; but they loved Bartja, and believed they saw in him the image of the great Cyrus the \"Father of his people.\"  Cambyses knew well that all this love, so freely given to Bartja, was not to be bought.  He did not hate his younger brother, but he felt annoyed that a youth who had as yet done nothing to distinguish himself, should be honored and revered as if he were already a hero and public benefactor.  Whatever annoyed or displeased him he considered must be wrong; where he disapproved he did not spare his censures, and from his very childhood, Cambyses' reproofs had been dreaded even by the mighty.  The enthusiastic shouts of the populace, the overflowing love of his mother and sister, and above all, the warm encomiums expressed by Nitetis, had excited a jealousy which his pride had never allowed hitherto.  Nitetis had taken his fancy in a remarkable degree.  This daughter of a powerful monarch, like himself disdaining everything mean and inferior, had yet acknowledged him to be her superior, and to win his favor had not shrunk from the laborious task of mastering his native language.  These qualities, added to her peculiar style of beauty, which excited his admiration from its rare novelty, half Egyptian half Greek, (her mother having been a Greek), had not failed to make a deep impression on him.  But she had been liberal in her praise of Bartja; that was enough to disturb Cambyses' mind and prepare the way for jealousy.  As he and his brother were leaving the women's apartments, Cambyses adopted a hasty resolution and exclaimed: \"You asked me just now for an opportunity of proving your courage.  I will not refuse.  The Tapuri have risen; I have sent troops to the frontier.  Go to Rhagae, take the command and show what you are worth.\"  \"Thanks, brother,\" cried Bartja.  \"May I take my friends, Darius, Gyges and Zopyrus with me?\"  \"That favor shall be granted too.  I hope you will all do your duty bravely and promptly, that you may be back in three months to join the main army in the expedition of revenge on the Massagetae.  It will take place in spring.\"  \"I will start to-morrow.\"  \"Then farewell.\"  \"If Auramazda should spare my life and I should return victorious, will you promise to grant me one favor?\"  \"Yes, I will.\"  \"Now, then, I feel confident of victory, even if I should have to stand with a thousand men against ten thousand of the enemy.\"  Bartja's eyes sparkled, he was thinking of Sappho.  \"Well,\" answered his brother, \"I shall be very glad if your actions bear out these glowing words.  But stop; I have something more to say.  You are now twenty years of age; you must marry.  Roxana, daughter of the noble Hydarnes, is marriageable, and is said to be beautiful.  Her birth makes her a fitting bride for you.\"  \"Oh!  brother, do not speak of marriage; I .  .  .\"  \"You must marry, for I have no children.\"  \"But you are still young; you will not remain childless.  Besides, I do not say that I will never marry.  Do not be angry, but just now, when I am to prove my courage, I would rather hear nothing about women.\"  \"Well, then, you must marry Roxana when you return from the North.  But I should advise you to take her with you to the field.  A Persian generally fights better if he knows that, beside his most precious treasures, he has a beautiful woman in his tent to defend.\"  \"Spare me this one command, my brother.  I conjure thee, by the soul of our father, not to inflict on me a wife of whom I know nothing, and never wish to know.  Give Roxana to Zopyrus, who is so fond of women, or to Darius or Bessus, who are related to her father Hydarnes.  I cannot love her, and should be miserable .  .  .\"  Cambyses interrupted him with a laugh, exclaiming: \"Did you learn these notions in Egypt, where it is the custom to be contented with one wife? In truth, I have long repented having sent a boy like you abroad.  I am not accustomed to bear contradiction, and shall listen to no excuses after the war.  This once I will allow you to go to the field without a wife.  I will not force you to do what, in your opinion, might endanger your valor.  But it seems to me that you have other and more secret reasons for refusing my brotherly proposal.  If that is the case, I am sorry for you.  However, for the present, you can depart, but after the war I will hear no remonstrances.  You know me.\"  \"Perhaps after the war I may ask for the very thing, which I am refusing now--but never for Roxana!  It is just as unwise to try to make a man happy by force as it is wicked to compel him to be unhappy, and I thank you for granting my request.\"  \"Don't try my powers of yielding too often!--How happy you look! I really believe you are in love with some one woman by whose side all the others have lost their charms.\"  Bartja blushed to his temples, and seizing his brother's hand, exclaimed: \"Ask no further now, accept my thanks once more, and farewell.  May I bid Nitetis farewell too, when I have taken leave of our mother and Atossa?\"  Cambyses bit his lip, looked searchingly into Bartja's face, and finding that the boy grew uneasy under his glance, exclaimed abruptly and angrily: \"Your first business is to hasten to the Tapuri.  My wife needs your care no longer; she has other protectors now.\"  So saying he turned his back on his brother and passed on into the great hall, blazing with gold, purple and jewels, where the chiefs of the army, satraps, judges,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5453"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 04 (#7)"],["body","easurers, secretaries, counsellors, eunuchs, door-keepers, introducers of strangers, chamberlains, keepers of the wardrobe, dressers, cup- bearers, equerries, masters of the chase, physicians, eyes and ears of the king, ambassadors and plenipotentiaries of all descriptions--were in waiting for him.       [The \"eyes and ears\" of the king may be compared to our police-      ministers.  Darius may have borrowed the name from Egypt, where such      titles as \"the 2 eyes of the king for Upper Egypt, the 2 ears of the      king for Lower Egypt\" are to be found on the earlier monuments, for      instance in the tomb of Amen en, heb at Abd el Qurnah.  And in      Herodotus II. 114.  the boy Cyrus calls one of his playfellows \"the      eye of the king,\"  Herod.  (I, 100.)]  The king was preceded by heralds bearing staves, and followed by a host of fan, sedan and footstool-bearers, men carrying carpets, and secretaries who the moment he uttered a command, or even indicated a concession, a punishment or a reward, hastened to note it down and at once hand it over to the officials empowered to execute his decrees.  In the middle of the brilliantly-lighted hall stood a gilded table, which looked as if it must give way beneath the mass of gold and silver vessels, plates, cups and bowls which were arranged with great order upon it.  The king's private table, the service on which was of immense worth and beauty, was placed in an apartment opening out of the large hall, and separated from it by purple hangings.  These concealed him from the gaze of the revellers, but did not prevent their every movement from being watched by his eye.  It was an object of the highest ambition to be one of those who ate at the king's table, and even he to whom a portion was sent might deem himself a highly-favored man.  As Cambyses entered the hall, nearly every one present prostrated themselves before him; his relations alone, distinguished by the blue and white fillet on the tiara, contented themselves with a deferential obeisance.  After the king had seated himself in his private apartment, the rest of the company took their places, and then a tremendous revel began. Animals, roasted whole, were placed on the table, and, when hunger was appeased, several courses of the rarest delicacies followed, celebrated in later times even among the Greeks under the name of \"Persian dessert.\"       [Herodotus (I. 133.) writes that the Persians fancied the Greeks'      hunger was never satisfied, because nothing special was brought to      the table at the end of the meal.]  Slaves then entered to remove the remains of the food.  Others brought in immense jugs of wine, the king left his own apartment, took his seat at the head of the table, numerous cup-bearers filled the golden drinking- cups in the most graceful manner, first tasting the wine to prove that it was free from poison, and soon one of those drinking-bouts had begun under the best auspices, at which, a century or two later, Alexander the Great, forgot not only moderation but even friendship itself.  Cambyses was unwontedly silent.  The suspicion had entered his mind, that Bartja loved Nitetis.  Why had he, contrary to all custom, so decidedly refused to marry a noble and beautiful girl, when his brother's childlessness rendered marriage an evident and urgent duty for him?  Why had he wished to see the Egyptian princess again before leaving Babylon? and blushed as he expressed that wish? and why had she, almost without being asked, praised him so warmly?  It is well that he is going, thought the king; at least he shall not rob me of her love.  If he were not my brother I would send him to a place from whence none can return.  After midnight he broke up the banquet.  Boges appeared to conduct him to the Harem, which he was accustomed to visit at this hour, when sufficiently sober.  \"Phaedime awaits you with impatience,\" said the eunuch.  \"Let her wait!\"  was the king's answer.  \"Have you given orders that the palace on the hanging-gardens shall be set in order?\"  \"It will be ready for occupation to-morrow.\"  \"What apartments have been assigned to the Egyptian Princess?\"  \"Those formerly occupied by the second wife of your father Cyrus, the deceased Amytis.\"  \"That is well.  Nitetis is to be treated with the greatest respect, and to receive no commands even from yourself, but such as I give you for her.\"  Boges bowed low.  \"See that no one, not even Croesus, has admission to her before my..... before I give further orders.\"  \"Croesus was with her this evening.\"  \"What may have been his business with my wife?\"  \"I do not know, for I do not understand the Greek language, but I heard the name of Bartja several times, and it seemed to me that the Egyptian had received sorrowful intelligence.  She was looking very sad when I came, after Croesus had left, to inquire if she had any commands for me.\"  \"May Ahriman blast thy tongue,\" muttered the king, and then turning his back on the eunuch he followed the torch-bearers and attendants, who were in waiting to disrobe him, to his own private apartments.  At noon on the following clay, Bartja, accompanied by his friends and a troop of attendants, started on horseback for the frontier.  Croesus went with the young warriors as far as the city gates, and as their last farewells and embraces were being exchanged, Bartja whispered to his old friend: \"If the messenger from Egypt should have a letter for me in his bag, will you send it on?\"  \"Shall you be able to decipher the Greek writing?\"  \"Gyges and love will help me!\"  \"When I told Nitetis of your departure she begged me to wish you farewell, and tell you not to forget Egypt.\"  \"I am not likely to do that.\"  \"The gods take thee into their care, my son.  Be prudent, do not risk your life heedlessly, but remember that it is no longer only your own. Exercise the gentleness of a father towards the rebels; they did not rise in mere self-will, but to gain their freedom, the most precious possession of mankind.  Remember, too, that to shew mercy is better than to shed blood; the sword killeth, but the favor of the ruler bringeth joy and happiness.  Conclude the war as speedily as possible, for war is a perversion of nature; in peace the sons outlive the fathers, but in war the fathers live to mourn for their slain sons.  Farewell, my young heroes, go forward and conquer!\"     CHAPTER XIII.  Cambyses passed a sleepless night.  The feeling of jealousy, so totally new to him, increased his desire to possess Nitetis, but he dared not take her as his wife yet, as the Persian law forbade the king to marry a foreign wife, until she had become familiar with the customs of Iran and confessed herself a disciple of Zoroaster.       [Zoroaster, really Zarathustra or Zerethoschtro, was one of the      `greatest among founders of new religions and lawgivers.  His name      signified \"golden star\" according to Anquetil du Perron.  But this      interpretation is as doubtful, as the many others which have been      attempted.  An appropriate one is given in the essay by Kern quoted      below, from zara golden, and thwistra glittering; thus \"the gold      glittering one.\"  It is uncertain whether he was born in Bactria,      Media or Persia, Anquetil thinks in Urmi, a town in Aderbaijan.  His      father's name was Porosehasp, his mother's Dogdo, and his family      boasted of royal descent.  The time of his birth is very,--Spiegel      says \"hopelessly\"--dark.  Anquetil, and many other scholars would      place it in the reign of Darius, a view which has been proved to be      incorrect by Spiegel, Duncker and v. Schack in his introduction.]  According to this law a whole year must pass before Nitetis could become the wife of a Persian monarch? but what was the law to Cambyses?  In his eyes the law was embodied in his own person, and in his opinion three months would be amply sufficient to initiate Nitetis in the Magian mysteries, after which process she could become his bride.  To-day his other wives seemed hateful, even loathsome, to him.  From Cambyses' earliest youth his house had been carefully provided with women.  Beautiful girls from all parts of Asia, black-eyed Armenians, dazzlingly fair maidens from the Caucasus, delicate girls from the shores of the Ganges, luxurious Babylonian women, golden-haired Persians and the effeminate daughters of the Median plains; indeed many of the noblest Achaemenidae had given him their daughters in marriage.  Phaedime, the daughter of Otanes, and niece of his own mother Kassandane, had been Cambyses' favorite wife hitherto, or at least the only one of whom it could be said that she was more to him than a purchased slave would have been.  But even she, in his present sated and disgusted state of feeling, seemed vulgar and contemptible, especially when he thought of Nitetis.  The Egyptian seemed formed of nobler, better stuff than they all.  They were flattering, coaxing girls; Nitetis was a queen.  They humbled themselves in the dust at his feet; but when he thought of Nitetis, he beheld her erect, standing before him, on the same proud level as himself.  He determined that from henceforth she should not only occupy Phaedime's place, but should be to him what Kassandane had been to his father Cyrus.  She was the only one of his wives who could assist him by her knowledge and advice; the others were all like children, ignorant, and caring for nothing but dress and finery: living only for petty intrigues and useless trifles.  This Egyptian girl would be obliged to love him, for he would be her protector, her lord, her father and brother in this foreign land.  \"She must,\" he said to himself, and to this despot to wish for a thing and to possess it seemed one and the same.  \"Bartja had better take care,\" he murmured, \"or he shall know what fate awaits the man who dares to cross my path.\"  Nitetis too had passed a restless night.  The common apartment of the women was next to her own, and the"]]]
