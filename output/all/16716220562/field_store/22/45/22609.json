I believe that Juvenal, one of the ancient writers who best understood human nature, was right in saying:                \"Nil erit ulterius, quod nostris moribus addat                Posteritas: eadem cupient facientque minores.\"  Leipsic, October 15th, 1877.     U A R D A.   CHAPTER I.  By the walls of Thebes--the old city of a hundred gates--the Nile spreads to a broad river; the heights, which follow the stream on both sides, here take a more decided outline; solitary, almost cone-shaped peaks stand out sharply from the level background of the many-colored. limestone hills, on which no palm-tree flourishes and in which no humble desert-plant can strike root.  Rocky crevasses and gorges cut more or less deeply into the mountain range, and up to its ridge extends the desert, destructive of all life, with sand and stones, with rocky cliffs and reef-like, desert hills.  Behind the eastern range the desert spreads to the Red Sea; behind the western it stretches without limit, into infinity.  In the belief of the Egyptians beyond it lay the region of the dead.  Between these two ranges of hills, which serve as walls or ramparts to keep back the desert-sand, flows the fresh and bounteous Nile, bestowing blessing and abundance; at once the father and the cradle of millions of beings.  On each shore spreads the wide plain of black and fruitful soil, and in the depths many-shaped creatures, in coats of mail or scales, swarm and find subsistence.  The lotos floats on the mirror of the waters, and among the papyrus reeds by the shore water-fowl innumerable build their nests.  Between the river and the mountain-range lie fields, which after the seed-time are of a shining blue-green, and towards the time of harvest glow like gold.  Near the brooks and water-wheels here and there stands a shady sycamore; and date-palms, carefully tended, group themselves in groves.  The fruitful plain, watered and manured every year by the inundation, lies at the foot of the sandy desert-hills behind it, and stands out like a garden flower- bed from the gravel-path.  In the fourteenth century before Christ--for to so remote a date we must direct the thoughts of the reader--impassable limits had been set by the hand of man, in many places in Thebes, to the inroads of the water; high dykes of stone and embankments protected the streets and squares, the temples and the palaces, from the overflow.  Canals that could be tightly closed up led from the dykes to the land within, and smaller branch-cuttings to the gardens of Thebes.  On the right, the eastern bank of the Nile, rose the buildings of the far-famed residence of the Pharaohs.  Close by the river stood the immense and gaudy Temples of the city of Amon; behind these and at a short distance from the Eastern hills--indeed at their very foot and partly even on the soil of the desert--were the palaces of the King and nobles, and the shady streets in which the high narrow houses of the citizens stood in close rows.  Life was gay and busy in the streets of the capital of the Pharaohs.  The western shore of the Nile showed a quite different scene.  Here too there was no lack of stately buildings or thronging men; but while on the farther side of the river there was a compact mass of houses, and the citizens went cheerfully and openly about their day's work, on this side there were solitary splendid structures, round which little houses and huts seemed to cling as children cling to the protection of a mother. And these buildings lay in detached groups.  Any one climbing the hill and looking down would form the notion that there lay below him a number of neighboring villages, each with its lordly manor house.  Looking from the plain up to the precipice of the western hills, hundreds of closed portals could be seen, some solitary, others closely ranged in rows; a great number of them towards the foot of the slope, yet more half-way up, and a few at a considerable height.  And even more dissimilar were the slow-moving, solemn groups in the roadways on this side, and the cheerful, confused throng yonder.  There, on the eastern shore, all were in eager pursuit of labor or recreation, stirred by pleasure or by grief, active in deed and speech; here, in the west, little was spoken, a spell seemed to check the footstep of the wanderer, a pale hand to sadden the bright glance of every eye, and to banish the smile from every lip.  And yet many a gaily-dressed bark stopped at the shore, there was no lack of minstrel bands, grand processions passed on to the western heights; but the Nile boats bore the dead, the songs sung here were songs of lamentation, and the processions consisted of mourners following the sarcophagus.  We are standing on the soil of the City of the Dead of Thebes.  Nevertheless even here nothing is wanting for return and revival, for to the Egyptian his dead died not.  He closed his eyes, he bore him to the Necropolis, to the house of the embalmer, or Kolchytes, and then to the grave; but he knew that the souls of the departed lived on; that the justified absorbed into Osiris floated over the Heavens in the vessel of the Sun; that they appeared on earth in the form they choose to take upon them, and that they might exert influence on the current of the lives of the survivors.  So he took care to give a worthy interment to his dead, above all to have the body embalmed so as to endure long: and had fixed times to bring fresh offerings for the dead of flesh and fowl, with drink-offerings and sweet-smelling essences, and vegetables and flowers.  Neither at the obsequies nor at the offerings might the ministers of the gods be absent, and the silent City of the Dead was regarded as a favored sanctuary in which to establish schools and dwellings for the learned.  So it came to pass that in the temples and on the site Of the Necropolis, large communities of priests dwelt together, and close to the extensive embalming houses lived numerous Kolchytes, who handed down the secrets of their art from father to son.  Besides these there were other manufactories and shops.  In the former, sarcophagi of stone and of wood, linen bands for enveloping mummies, and amulets for decorating them, were made; in the latter, merchants kept spices and essences, flowers, fruits, vegetables and pastry for sale. Calves, gazelles, goats, geese and other fowl, were fed on enclosed meadow-plats, and the mourners betook themselves thither to select what they needed from among the beasts pronounced by the priests to be clean for sacrifice, and to have them sealed with the sacred seal.  Many bought only part of a victim at the shambles--the poor could not even do this. They bought only colored cakes in the shape of beasts, which symbolically took the place of the calves and geese which their means were unable to procure.  In the handsomest shops sat servants of the priests, who received forms written on rolls of papyrus which were filled up in the writing room of the temple with those sacred verses which the departed spirit must know and repeat to ward off the evil genius of the deep, to open the gate of the under world, and to be held righteous before Osiris and the forty-two assessors of the subterranean court of justice.  What took place within the temples was concealed from view, for each was surrounded by a high enclosing wall with lofty, carefully-closed portals, which were only opened when a chorus of priests came out to sing a pious hymn, in the morning to Horus the rising god, and in the evening to Tum the descending god.       [The course of the Sun was compared to that of the life of Man.      He rose as the child Horns, grew by midday to the hero Ra, who      conquered the Uraeus snake for his diadem, and by evening was an old      Man, Tum.  Light had been born of darkness, hence Tum was regarded      as older than Horns and the other gods of light.]  As soon as the evening hymn of the priests was heard, the Necropolis was deserted, for the mourners and those who were visiting the graves were required by this time to return to their boats and to quit the City of the Dead.  Crowds of men who had marched in the processions of the west bank hastened in disorder to the shore, driven on by the body of watchmen who took it in turns to do this duty and to protect the graves against robbers.  The merchants closed their booths, the embalmers and workmen ended their day's work and retired to their houses, the priests returned to the temples, and the inns were filled with guests, who had come hither on long pilgrimages from a distance, and who preferred passing the night in the vicinity of the dead whom they had come to visit, to going across to the bustling noisy city farther shore.  The voices of the singers and of the wailing women were hushed, even the song of the sailors on the numberless ferry boats from the western shore to Thebes died away, its faint echo was now and then borne across on the evening air, and at last all was still.  A cloudless sky spread over the silent City of the Dead, now and then darkened for an instant by the swiftly passing shade of a bat returning to its home in a cave or cleft of the rock after flying the whole evening near the Nile to catch flies, to drink, and so prepare itself for the next day's sleep.  From time to time black forms with long shadows glided over the still illuminated plain--the jackals, who at this hour frequented the shore to slake their thirst, and often fearlessly showed themselves in troops in the vicinity of the pens of geese and goats.  It was forbidden to hunt these robbers, as they were accounted sacred to the god Anubis, the tutelary of sepulchres; and indeed they did little mischief, for they found abundant food in the tombs.       [The jackal-headed god Anubis was the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5439"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 01 (#2)"],["body","of Osiris and Nephthys,      and the jackal was sacred to him.  In the earliest ages even he is      prominent in the nether world.  He conducts the mummifying process,      preserves the corpse, guards the Necropolis, and, as Hermes      Psychopompos (Hermanubis), opens the way for the souls.  According      to Plutarch \"He is the watch of the gods as the dog is the watch of      men.\"]  The remnants of the meat offerings from the altars were consumed by them; to the perfect satisfaction of the devotees, who, when they found that by the following day the meat had disappeared, believed that it had been accepted and taken away by the spirits of the underworld.  They also did the duty of trusty watchers, for they were a dangerous foe for any intruder who, under the shadow of the night, might attempt to violate a grave.  Thus--on that summer evening of the year 1352 B.C., when we invite the reader to accompany us to the Necropolis of Thebes--after the priests' hymn had died away, all was still in the City of the Dead.  The soldiers on guard were already returning from their first round when suddenly, on the north side of the Necropolis, a dog barked loudly; soon a second took up the cry, a third, a fourth.  The captain of the watch called to his men to halt, and, as the cry of the dogs spread and grew louder every minute, commanded them to march towards the north.  The little troop had reached the high dyke which divided the west bank of the Nile from a branch canal, and looked from thence over the plain as far as the river and to the north of the Necropolis.  Once more the word to \"halt\" was given, and as the guard perceived the glare of torches in the direction where the dogs were barking loudest, they hurried forward and came up with the author of the disturbance near the Pylon of the temple erected by Seti I., the deceased father of the reigning King Rameses II.       [The two pyramidal towers joined by a gateway which formed the      entrance to an Egyptian temple were called the Pylon.]  The moon was up, and her pale light flooded the stately structure, while the walls glowed with the ruddy smoky light of the torches which flared in the hands of black attendants.  A man of sturdy build, in sumptuous dress, was knocking at the brass- covered temple door with the metal handle of a whip, so violently that the blows rang far and loud through the night.  Near him stood a litter, and a chariot, to which were harnessed two fine horses.  In the litter sat a young woman, and in the carriage, next to the driver, was the tall figure of a lady.  Several men of the upper classes and many servants stood around the litter and the chariot.  Few words were exchanged; the whole attention of the strangely lighted groups seemed concentrated on the temple-gate.  The darkness concealed the features of individuals, but the mingled light of the moon and the torches was enough to reveal to the gate-keeper, who looked down on the party from a tower of the Pylon, that it was composed of persons of the highest rank; nay, perhaps of the royal family.  He called aloud to the one who knocked, and asked him what was his will.  He looked up, and in a voice so rough and imperious, that the lady in the litter shrank in horror as its tones suddenly violated the place of the dead, he cried out--\"How long are we to wait here for you--you dirty hound?  Come down and open the door and then ask questions.  If the torch-light is not bright enough to show you who is waiting, I will score our name on your shoulders with my whip, and teach you how to receive princely visitors.\"  While the porter muttered an unintelligible answer and came down the steps within to open the door, the lady in the chariot turned to her impatient companion and said in a pleasant but yet decided voice, \"You forget, Paaker, that you are back again in Egypt, and that here you have to deal not with the wild Schasu,--[A Semitic race of robbers in the cast of Egypt.]--but with friendly priests of whom we have to solicit a favor. We have always had to lament your roughness, which seems to me very ill- suited to the unusual circumstances under which we approach this sanctuary.\"  Although these words were spoken in a tone rather of regret than of blame, they wounded the sensibilities of the person addressed; his wide nostrils began to twitch ominously, he clenched his right hand over the handle of his whip, and, while he seemed to be bowing humbly, he struck such a heavy blow on the bare leg of a slave who was standing near to him, an old Ethiopian, that he shuddered as if from sudden cold, though- knowing his lord only too well--he let no cry of pain escape him. Meanwhile the gate-keeper had opened the door, and with him a tall young priest stepped out into the open air to ask the will of the intruders.  Paaker would have seized the opportunity of speaking, but the lady in the chariot interposed and said:  \"I am Bent-Anat, the daughter of the King, and this lady in the litter is Nefert, the wife of the noble Mena, the charioteer of my father.  We were going in company with these gentlemen to the north-west valley of the Necropolis to see the new works there.  You know the narrow pass in the rocks which leads up the gorge.  On the way home I myself held the reins and I had the misfortune to drive over a girl who sat by the road with a basket full of flowers, and to hurt her--to hurt her very badly I am afraid.  The wife of Mena with her own hands bound up the child, and then she carried her to her father's house--he is a paraschites--[One who opened the bodies of the dead to prepare them for being embalmed.]-- Pinem is his name.  I know not whether he is known to you.\"  \"Thou hast been into his house, Princess?\"  \"Indeed, I was obliged, holy father,\" she replied, \"I know of course that I have defiled myself by crossing the threshold of these people, but--\"  \"But,\" cried the wife of Mena, raising herself in her litter, \"Bent-Anat can in a day be purified by thee or by her house-priest, while she can hardly--or perhaps never--restore the child whole and sound again to the unhappy father.\"  \"Still, the den of a paraschites is above every thing unclean,\" said the chamberlain Penbesa, master of the ceremonies to the princess, interrupting the wife of Mena, \"and I did not conceal my opinion when Bent-Anat announced her intention of visiting the accursed hole in person.  I suggested,\" he continued, turning to the priest, \"that she should let the girl be taken home, and send a royal present to the father.\"  \"And the princess?\"  asked the priest.  \"She acted, as she always does, on her own judgment,\" replied the master of the ceremonies.  \"And that always hits on the right course,\" cried the wife of Mena.  \"Would to God it were so!\"  said the princess in a subdued voice.  Then she continued, addressing the priest, \"Thou knowest the will of the Gods and the hearts of men, holy father, and I myself know that I give alms willingly and help the poor even when there is none to plead for them but their poverty.  But after what has occurred here, and to these unhappy people, it is I who come as a suppliant.\"  \"Thou?\"  said the chamberlain.  \"I,\" answered the princess with decision.  The priest who up to this moment had remained a silent witness of the scene raised his right hand as in blessing and  spoke.  \"Thou hast done well.  The Hathors fashioned thy heart and the Lady of Truth guides it.  Thou hast broken in on our night-prayers to request us to send a doctor to the injured girl?\"       [Hathor was Isis under a substantial form.  She is the goddess of      the pure, light heaven, and bears the Sun-disk between cow-horns on      a cow's head or on a human head with cow's ears.  She was named the      Fair, and all the pure joys of life are in her gift.  Later she was      regarded as a Muse who beautifies life with enjoyment, love, song,      and the dance.  She appears as a good fairy by the cradle of      children and decides their lot in life.  She bears many names: and      several, generally seven, Hathors were represented, who personified      the attributes and influence of the goddess.]  \"Thou hast said.\"  \"I will ask the high-priest to send the best leech for outward wounds immediately to the child.  But where is the house of the paraschites Pinem?  I do not know it.\"  \"Northwards from the terrace of Hatasu,--[A great queen of the 18th dynasty and guardian of two Pharaohs]--close to--; but I will charge one of my attendants to conduct the leech.  Besides, I want to know early in the morning how the child is doing.--Paaker.\"  The rough visitor, whom we already know, thus called upon, bowed to the earth, his arms hanging by his sides, and asked:  \"What dost thou command?\"  \"I appoint you guide to the physician,\" said the princess.  \"It will be easy to the king's pioneer to find the little half-hidden house again--       [The title here rendered pioneer was that of an officer whose duties      were those at once of a scout and of a Quarter-Master General.  In      unknown and comparatively savage countries it was an onerous post.      --Translator.]  besides, you share my guilt, for,\" she added, turning to the priest, \"I confess that the misfortune happened because I would try with my horses to overtake Paaker's Syrian racers, which he declared to be swifter than the Egyptian horses.  It was a mad race.\"  \"And Amon be praised that it ended as it did,\" exclaimed the master of the ceremonies.  \"Packer's chariot lies dashed in pieces in the valley, and his best horse is badly hurt.\"  \"He will see to him when he has taken the physician to the house of the paraschites,\" said the princess.  \"Dost thou know, Penbesa--thou anxious guardian of a thoughtless girl--that to-day for the first time I am glad that my father is at the war in distant Satiland?\"--[Asia].  \"He would not have welcomed us kindly!\"  said the master of the ceremonies, laughing.  \"But the leech, the leech!\"  cried Bent-Anat"]]]
