It was easy to read in her high, smooth brow and dark-blue eyes with their direct gaze, that she could think clearly and decisively, and also feel deeply. But she seemed wilful too, and contradictory--at any rate to-day; for when Orion pointed out some move to her she rarely took his advice, but with set lips, pushed the piece according to her own, rarely wiser, judgment. It was quite plain that she was refractory under the guidance of this--especially of this counsellor.  The bystanders could not fail to see the girl’s repellent manner and Orion’s eager attempts to propitiate her; and for this reason Neforis was glad when, just as her husband had finished the third game, and had pushed the men together on the board with the back of his hand, his chamberlain reminded him that the Arab was without, awaiting his pleasure with growing impatience. The Mukaukas answered only by a sign, drew his long caftan of the finest wool closer around him, and pointed to the doors and the open roof. The rest of the party had long felt the chill of the damp night air that blew through the room from the river, but knowing that the father suffered more from heat than from anything, they had all willingly endured the draught. Now, however, Orion called the slaves, and before the strangers were admitted the doors were closed and the roof covered.  Paula rose; the governor lay motionless and kept his eyes apparently closed; he must, however, have seen what was going forward through an imperceptible slit, for he turned first to Paula and then to the other women saying: “Is it not strange?--Most old folks, like children, seek the sun, and love to sit, as the others play, in its heat. While I--something that happened to me years ago--you know;--and it seemed to freeze my blood. Now it never gets warm, and I feel the contrast between the coolness in here and the heat outside most acutely, almost as a pain. The older we grow the more ready we are to abandon to the young the things we ourselves used most to enjoy. The only thing which we old folks do not willingly relinquish is personal comfort, and I thank you for enduring annoyances so patiently for the sake of securing mine.--It is a terrific summer! You, Paula, from the heights of Lebanon, know what ice is. How often have I wished that I could have a bed of snow. To feel myself one with that fresh, still coldness would be all I wish for! The cold air which you dread does me good. But the warmth of youth rebels against everything that is cool.”  This was the first long sentence the Mukaukas had uttered since the beginning of the game. Orion listened respectfully to the end, but then he said with a laugh: “But there are some young people who seem to take pleasure in being cool and icy--for what cause God alone knows!”  As he spoke he looked the girl at whom the words were aimed, full in the face; but she turned silently and proudly away, and an angry shade passed over her lovely features.     CHAPTER V.  When the Arab was at last admitted to the governor’s presence his attendants unfolded a hanging before him. The giant Masdakite did the chief share of the work; but as soon as the Mukaukas caught sight of the big man, with his bushy, mane-like hair, and a dagger and a battle-axe stuck through his belt, he cried out:  “Away, away with him! That man--those weapons--I will not look at the hanging till he is gone.”  His hands were trembling, and the merchant at once desired his faithful Rustem, the most harmless of mortals, to quit the room. The governor, whose sensitive nerves had been liable to such attacks of panic ever since an exiled Greek had once attempted to murder him, now soon recovered his composure, and looked with great admiration at the hanging round which the family were standing. They all confessed they had never seen anything like it, and the vivacious Dame Susannah proposed to send for her daughter and her visitors; but it was already late, and her house was so far from the governor’s that she gave that up. The father and son had already heard of this marvellous piece of work, which had formed part of the plunder taken by the Arab conquerors of the Persian Empire at the sack of the “White Tower”--the royal palace of Madam, the capital of the Sassanidze. They knew that it had been originally 300 ells long and 60 ells wide, and had heard with indignation that the Khaliff Omar, who always lived and dressed and ate like the chief of a caravan, and looked down with contempt on all such objects of luxury, had cut this inestimable treasure of art into pieces and divided it among the Companions of the Prophet.  Haschim explained to them that this particular fragment had been the share of the booty allotted to Ali, the Prophet’s son-in-law. Haschim himself had seen the work before its dismemberment at Madain, where it hung on the wall of the magnificent throne-room, and subsequently, at Medina.  His audience eagerly requested him to describe the other portions; he, however, seemed somewhat uneasy, looking down at his bare feet which were standing on the mosaic pavement, damp from the fountain; for, after the manner of his nation, he had left his shoes in the outer room. The governor had noticed the old man’s gestures as he repeatedly put his hand to his mouth, and while his wife, Orion, and the widow were besieging the merchant with questions, he whispered a few words to one of the slaves. The man vanished, and returned bringing in, by his master’s orders, a long strip of carpet which he laid in front of the Arab’s brown and strong but delicately-formed feet.  A wonderful change came over the merchant’s whole being as this was done. He drew himself up with a dignity which none of those present had suspected in the man who had so humbly entered the room and so diligently praised his wares; an expression of satisfaction overspread his calm, mild features, a sweet smile parted his lips, and his kind eyes sparkled through tears like those of a child unexpectedly pleased. Then he bowed before the Mukaukas, touching his brow, lips and breast with the finger-tips of the right hand to express: “All my thoughts, words and feelings are devoted to you,”--while he said: “Thanks, Son of Menas. That was the act of Moslem.”  “Of a Christian!” cried Orion hastily. But his father shook his head gently, and said, slowly and impressively: “Only of a man.”  “Of a man,” repeated the merchant, and then he added thoughtfully: “Of a man! Yes, that is the highest mark so long as we are what we ought to be The image of the one God. Who is more compassionate than He? And every mother’s son who is likewise compassionate, is like him.”  “Another Christian rule, thou strange Moslem!” said Orion interrupting him.  “And yet,” said Haschim, with tranquil dignity, “it corresponds word for word with the teaching of the Best of men--our Prophet. I am one of those who knew him here on earth. His brother’s smallest pain filled his soft heart with friendly sympathy; his law insists on charity, even towards the shrub by the wayside; he pronounces it mortal sin to injure it, and every Moslem must obey him. Compassion for all is the command of the Prophet....” Here the Arab was suddenly and roughly interrupted; Paula, who, till now, had been leaning against a pilaster, contemplating the hanging and silently listening to the conversation, hastily stepped nearer to the old man, and with flaming cheeks and flashing eyes pointed at him wrathfully, while she exclaimed in a trembling voice-heedless alike of the astonished and indignant bystanders, and of the little dog which flew at the Arab, barking furiously:  “You--you, the followers of the false prophet--you, the companions of the bloodhound Khalid--you and Charity! I know you! I know what you did in Syria. With these eyes have I seen you, and your bloodthirsty women, and the foam on your raging lips. Here I stand to bear witness against you and I cast it in your teeth: You broke faith in Damascus, and the victims of your treachery--defenceless women and tender infants as well as men--you killed with the sword or strangled with your hands. You--you the Apostle of Compassion?--have you ever heard of Abyla? You, the friend of your Prophet--I ask you what did you, who so tenderly spare the tree by the wayside, do to the innocent folk of Abyla, whom you fell upon like wolves in a sheepfold? You--you and Compassionate!” The vehement girl, to whom no one had ever shown any pity, and on whose soul the word had fallen like a mockery, who for long hours had been suffering suppressed and torturing misery, felt it a relief to give free vent to the anguish of her soul; she ended with a hard laugh, and waved her hand round her head as though to disperse a swarm of gadflies.  What a woman!  Orion’s gaze was fixed on her in horror--but in enchantment. Yes, his mother had judged her rightly. No gentle, tender-hearted woman laughed like that; but she was grand, splendid, wonderful in her wrath. She reminded him of the picture of the goddess of vengeance, by Apelles, which he had seen in Constantinople. His mother shrugged her shoulders and cast a meaning glance at the widow, and even his father was startled at the sight. He knew what had roused her; still he felt that he could not permit this, and he recalled the excited girl to her senses by speaking her name, half-reproachfully and half-regretfully, at first quite gently but then louder and more severely.  She started like a sleep-walker suddenly awaked from her trance, passed her hand over her eyes, and said, as she bowed her head before the governor:  “Forgive me, Uncle, I am sorry for what has occurred--but it was too much for me. You know what my past has been, and when I am reminded--when I must listen to the praises even of the wretches to whom my father and brother....”  A loud sob"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/553"],["title","Out of Time's Abyss (#0)"],["body","of Time's Abyss   By  Edgar Rice Burroughs     Chapter I  This is the tale of Bradley after he left Fort Dinosaur upon the west coast of the great lake that is in the center of the island.  Upon the fourth day of September, 1916, he set out with four companions, Sinclair, Brady, James, and Tippet, to search along the base of the barrier cliffs for a point at which they might be scaled.  Through the heavy Caspakian air, beneath the swollen sun, the five men marched northwest from Fort Dinosaur, now waist-deep in lush, jungle grasses starred with myriad gorgeous blooms, now across open meadow-land and parklike expanses and again plunging into dense forests of eucalyptus and acacia and giant arboreous ferns with feathered fronds waving gently a hundred feet above their heads.  About them upon the ground, among the trees and in the air over them moved and swung and soared the countless forms of Caspak's teeming life.  Always were they menaced by some frightful thing and seldom were their rifles cool, yet even in the brief time they had dwelt upon Caprona they had become callous to danger, so that they swung along laughing and chatting like soldiers on a summer hike.  \"This reminds me of South Clark Street,\" remarked Brady, who had once served on the traffic squad in Chicago; and as no one asked him why, he volunteered that it was \"because it's no place for an Irishman.\"  \"South Clark Street and heaven have something in common, then,\" suggested Sinclair.  James and Tippet laughed, and then a hideous growl broke from a dense thicket ahead and diverted their attention to other matters.  \"One of them behemoths of 'Oly Writ,\" muttered Tippet as they came to a halt and with guns ready awaited the almost inevitable charge.  \"Hungry lot o' beggars, these,\" said Bradley; \"always trying to eat everything they see.\"  For a moment no further sound came from the thicket.  \"He may be feeding now,\" suggested Bradley.  \"We'll try to go around him.  Can't waste ammunition.  Won't last forever.  Follow me.\"  And he set off at right angles to their former course, hoping to avert a charge.  They had taken a dozen steps, perhaps, when the thicket moved to the advance of the thing within it, the leafy branches parted, and the hideous head of a gigantic bear emerged.  \"Pick your trees,\" whispered Bradley.  \"Can't waste ammunition.\"  The men looked about them.  The bear took a couple of steps forward, still growling menacingly.  He was exposed to the shoulders now. Tippet took one look at the monster and bolted for the nearest tree; and then the bear charged.  He charged straight for Tippet.  The other men scattered for the various trees they had selected--all except Bradley.  He stood watching Tippet and the bear.  The man had a good start and the tree was not far away; but the speed of the enormous creature behind him was something to marvel at, yet Tippet was in a fair way to make his sanctuary when his foot caught in a tangle of roots and down he went, his rifle flying from his hand and falling several yards away.  Instantly Bradley's piece was at his shoulder, there was a sharp report answered by a roar of mingled rage and pain from the carnivore.  Tippet attempted to scramble to his feet.  \"Lie still!\" shouted Bradley.  \"Can't waste ammunition.\"  The bear halted in its tracks, wheeled toward Bradley and then back again toward Tippet.  Again the former's rifle spit angrily, and the bear turned again in his direction.  Bradley shouted loudly.  \"Come on, you behemoth of Holy Writ!\" he cried.  \"Come on, you duffer!  Can't waste ammunition.\"  And as he saw the bear apparently upon the verge of deciding to charge him, he encouraged the idea by backing rapidly away, knowing that an angry beast will more often charge one who moves than one who lies still.  And the bear did charge.  Like a bolt of lightning he flashed down upon the Englishman.  \"Now run!\"  Bradley called to Tippet and himself turned in flight toward a nearby tree.  The other men, now safely ensconced upon various branches, watched the race with breathless interest.  Would Bradley make it?  It seemed scarce possible.  And if he didn't!  James gasped at the thought.  Six feet at the shoulder stood the frightful mountain of blood-mad flesh and bone and sinew that was bearing down with the speed of an express train upon the seemingly slow-moving man.  It all happened in a few seconds; but they were seconds that seemed like hours to the men who watched.  They saw Tippet leap to his feet at Bradley's shouted warning.  They saw him run, stooping to recover his rifle as he passed the spot where it had fallen.  They saw him glance back toward Bradley, and then they saw him stop short of the tree that might have given him safety and turn back in the direction of the bear. Firing as he ran, Tippet raced after the great cave bear--the monstrous thing that should have been extinct ages before--ran for it and fired even as the beast was almost upon Bradley.  The men in the trees scarcely breathed.  It seemed to them such a futile thing for Tippet to do, and Tippet of all men!  They had never looked upon Tippet as a coward--there seemed to be no cowards among that strangely assorted company that Fate had gathered together from the four corners of the earth--but Tippet was considered a cautious man.  Overcautious, some thought him.  How futile he and his little pop-gun appeared as he dashed after that living engine of destruction!  But, oh, how glorious! It was some such thought as this that ran through Brady's mind, though articulated it might have been expressed otherwise, albeit more forcefully.  Just then it occurred to Brady to fire and he, too, opened upon the bear, but at the same instant the animal stumbled and fell forward, though still growling most fearsomely.  Tippet never stopped running or firing until he stood within a foot of the brute, which lay almost touching Bradley and was already struggling to regain its feet. Placing the muzzle of his gun against the bear's ear, Tippet pulled the trigger.  The creature sank limply to the ground and Bradley scrambled to his feet.  \"Good work, Tippet,\" he said.  \"Mightily obliged to you--awful waste of ammunition, really.\"  And then they resumed the march and in fifteen minutes the encounter had ceased even to be a topic of conversation.  For two days they continued upon their perilous way.  Already the cliffs loomed high and forbidding close ahead without sign of break to encourage hope that somewhere they might be scaled.  Late in the afternoon the party crossed a small stream of warm water upon the sluggishly moving surface of which floated countless millions of tiny green eggs surrounded by a light scum of the same color, though of a darker shade.  Their past experience of Caspak had taught them that they might expect to come upon a stagnant pool of warm water if they followed the stream to its source; but there they were almost certain to find some of Caspak's grotesque, manlike creatures.  Already since they had disembarked from the U-33 after its perilous trip through the subterranean channel beneath the barrier cliffs had brought them into the inland sea of Caspak, had they encountered what had appeared to be three distinct types of these creatures.  There had been the pure apes--huge, gorillalike beasts--and those who walked, a trifle more erect and had features with just a shade more of the human cast about them.  Then there were men like Ahm, whom they had captured and confined at the fort--Ahm, the club-man.  \"Well-known club-man,\" Tyler had called him.  Ahm and his people had knowledge of a speech.  They had a language, in which they were unlike the race just inferior to them, and they walked much more erect and were less hairy: but it was principally the fact that they possessed a spoken language and carried a weapon that differentiated them from the others.  All of these peoples had proven belligerent in the extreme.  In common with the rest of the fauna of Caprona the first law of nature as they seemed to understand it was to kill--kill--kill.  And so it was that Bradley had no desire to follow up the little stream toward the pool near which were sure to be the caves of some savage tribe, but fortune played him an unkind trick, for the pool was much closer than he imagined, its southern end reaching fully a mile south of the point at which they crossed the stream, and so it was that after forcing their way through a tangle of jungle vegetation they came out upon the edge of the pool which they had wished to avoid.  Almost simultaneously there appeared south of them a party of naked men armed with clubs and hatchets.  Both parties halted as they caught sight of one another.  The men from the fort saw before them a hunting party evidently returning to its caves or village laden with meat. They were large men with features closely resembling those of the African Negro though their skins were white.  Short hair grew upon a large portion of their limbs and bodies, which still retained a considerable trace of apish progenitors.  They were, however, a distinctly higher type than the Bo-lu, or club-men.  Bradley would have been glad to have averted a meeting; but as he desired to lead his party south around the end of the pool, and as it was hemmed in by the jungle on one side and the water on the other, there seemed no escape from an encounter.  On the chance that he might avoid a clash, Bradley stepped forward with upraised hand.  \"We are friends,\" he called in the tongue of Ahm, the Bo-lu, who had been held a prisoner at the fort; \"permit us to pass in peace.  We will not harm you.\"  At this the hatchet-men set up a great jabbering with much laughter, loud and boisterous.  \"No,\" shouted one, \"you will not harm us, for we shall kill you.  Come!  We kill!  We kill!\" And with hideous shouts they charged down upon the Europeans.  \"Sinclair, you may fire,\" said Bradley quietly.  \"Pick off the leader. Can't waste ammunition.\""]]]
