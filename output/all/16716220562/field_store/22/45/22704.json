The Persians deliberated and resolved when they      were intoxicated, and when they were sober reconsidered their      determinations.  Tacitus tells the same of the old Germans.  Germ,      c. 22.]  Hystaspes, the father of Darius, was an old man.  He answered: \"It seems to me, that the messengers of this wandering tribe have left us no choice.  We cannot go to war against desert wastes; but as our host is already under arms and our swords have lain long in their scabbards, war we must have.  We only want a few good enemies, and I know no easier work than to make them.\"  At these words the Persians broke into loud shouts of delight; but Croesus only waited till the noise had ceased to say: \"Hystaspes, you and I are both old men; but you are a thorough Persian and fancy you can only be happy in battle and bloodshed.  You are now obliged to lean for support on the staff, which used to be the badge of your rank as commander, and yet you speak like a hot-blooded boy.  I agree with you that enemies are easy enough to find, but only fools go out to look for them.  The man who tries to make enemies is like a wretch who mutilates his own body.  If the enemies are there, let us go out to meet them like wise men who wish to look misfortune boldly in the face; but let us never try to begin an unjust war, hateful to the gods.  We will wait until wrong has been done us, and then go to victory or death, conscious that we have right on our side.\"  The old man was interrupted by a low murmur of applause, drowned however quickly by cries of \"Hystaspes is right!  let us look for an enemy!\"  It was now the turn of the envoy Prexaspes to speak, and he answered laughing: \"Let us follow the advice of both these noble old men.  We will do as Croesus bids us and not go out to seek an enemy, but at the same time we will follow Hystaspes' advice by raising our claims and pronouncing every one our enemy, who does not cheerfully consent to become a member of the kingdom founded by our great father Cyrus.  For instance, we will ask the Indians if they would feel proud to obey your sceptre, Cambyses.  If they answer no, it is a sign that they do not love us, and whoever does not love us, must be our enemy.\"  \"That won't do,\" cried Zopyrus.  \"We must have war at any price.\"  \"I vote for Croesus,\" said Gobryas.  \"And I too,\" said the noble Artabazus.  \"We are for Hystaspes,\" shouted the warrior Araspes, the old Intaphernes, and some more of Cyrus's old companions-in-arms.  \"War we must have at any price,\" roared the general Megabyzus, the father of Zopyrus, striking the table so sharply with his heavy fist, that the golden vessels rang again, and some goblets even fell; \"but not with the Massagetac--not with a flying foe.\"  \"There must be no war with the Massagetae,\" said the high-priest Oropastes.  \"The gods themselves have avenged Cyrus's death upon them.\"  Cambyses sat for some moments, quietly and coldly watching the unrestrained enthusiasm of his warriors, and then, rising from his seat, thundered out the words: \"Silence, and listen to your king!\"  The words worked like magic on this multitude of drunken men.  Even those who were most under the influence of wine, listened to their king in a kind of unconscious obedience.  He lowered his voice and went on: \"I did not ask whether you wished for peace or war--I know that every Persian prefers the labor of war to an inglorious idleness--but I wished to know what answer you would give the Massagetan warriors.  Do you consider that the soul of my father--of the man to whom you owe all your greatness--has been sufficiently avenged?\"  A dull murmur in the affirmative, interrupted by some violent voices in the negative, was the answer.  The king then asked a second question: \"Shall we accept the conditions proposed by their envoys, and grant peace to this nation, already so scourged and desolated by the gods?\"  To this they all agreed eagerly.  \"That is what I wished to know,\" continued Cambyses.  \"To-morrow, when we are sober, we will follow the old custom and reconsider what has been resolved on during our intoxication.  Drink on, all of you, as long as the night lasts.  To-morrow, at the last crow of the sacred bird Parodar, I shall expect you to meet me for the chase, at the gate of the temple of Bel.\"  So saying, the king left the hall, followed by a thundering \"Victory to the king!\"  Boges had slipped out quietly before him.  In the forecourt he found one of the gardener's boys from the hanging-gardens.  \"What do you want here?\"  asked Boges.  \"I have something for the prince Bartja.\"  \"For Bartja?  Has he asked your master to send him some seeds or slips?\"  The boy shook his sunburnt head and smiled roguishly.  \"Some one else sent you then?\"  said Boges becoming more attentive.  \"Yes, some one else.\"  \"Ah! the Egyptian has sent a message to her brother-in-law?\"  \"Who told you that?\"  \"Nitetis spoke to me about it.  Here, give me what you have; I will give it to Bartja at once.\"  \"I was not to give it to any one but the prince himself.\"  \"Give it to me; it will be safer in my hands than in yours.\"  \"I dare not.\"  \"Obey me at once, or--\"  At this moment the king came up.  Boges thought a moment, and then called in a loud voice to the whip-bearers on duty at the palace-gate, to take the astonished boy up.  \"What is the matter here?\"  asked Cambyses.  \"This fellow,\" answered the eunuch, \"has had the audacity to make his way into the palace with a message from your consort Nitetis to Bartja.\"  At sight of the king, the boy had fallen on his knees, touching the ground with his forehead.  Cambyses looked at him and turned deadly pale.  Then, turning to the eunuch, he asked: \"What does the Egyptian Princess wish from my brother?\"  \"The boy declares that he has orders to give up what has been entrusted to him to no one but Bartja.\"  On hearing this the boy looked imploringly up at the king, and held out a little papyrus roll.  Cambyses snatched it out of his hand, but the next moment stamped furiously on the ground at seeing that the letter was written in Greek, which he could not read.  He collected himself, however, and, with an awful look, asked the boy who had given him the letter.  \"The Egyptian lady's waiting-woman Mandane,\" he answered; \"the Magian's daughter.\"  \"For my brother Bartja?\"  \"She said I was to give the letter to the handsome prince, before the banquet, with a greeting from her mistress Nitetis, and I was to tell him .  .  .\"  Here the king stamped so furiously, that the boy was frightened and could only stammer: \"Before the banquet the prince was walking with you, so I could not speak to him, and now I am waiting for him here, for Mandane promised to give me a piece of gold if I did what she told me cleverly.\"  \"And that you have not done,\" thundered the king, fancying himself shamefully deceived.  \"No, indeed you have not.  Here, guards, seize this fellow!\"  The boy begged and prayed, but all in vain; the whip-bearers seized him quick as thought, and Cambyses, who went off at once to his own apartments, was soon out of reach of his whining entreaties for mercy.  Boges followed his master, rubbing his fat hands, and laughing quietly to himself.  The king's attendants began their work of disrobing him, but he told them angrily to leave him at once.  As soon as they were gone, he called Boges and said in a low voice: \"From this time forward the hanging-gardens and the Egyptian are under your control.  Watch her carefully!  If a single human being or a message reaches her without my knowledge, your life will be the forfeit.\"  \"But if Kassandane or Atossa should send to her?\"  \"Turn the messengers away, and send word that every attempt to see or communicate with Nitetis will be regarded by me as a personal offence.\"  \"May I ask a favor for myself, O King?\"  \"The time is not well chosen for asking favors.\"  \"I feel ill.  Permit some one else to take charge of the hanging-gardens for to-morrow only.\"  \"No!--now leave me.\"  \"I am in a burning fever and have lost consciousness three times during the day--if when I am in that state any one should  .  .  .\"  But who could take your place?\"  \"The Lydian captain of the eunuchs, Kandaules.  He is true as gold, and inflexibly severe.  One day of rest would restore me to health.  Have mercy, O King!\"  \"No one is so badly served as the king himself.  Kandaules may take your place to-morrow, but give hum the strictest orders, and say that the slightest neglect will put his life in danger.--Now depart.\"  \"Yet one word, my King: to-morrow night the rare blue lily in the hanging-gardens will open.  Hystaspes, Intaphernes, Gobyras, Croesus and Oropastes, the greatest horticulturists at your court, would very much like to see it.  May they be allowed to visit the gardens for a few minutes?  Kandaules shall see that they enter into no communication with the Egyptian.\"  \"Kandaules must keep his eyes open, if he cares for his own life.--Go!\"  Boges made a deep obeisance and left the king's apartment.  He threw a few gold pieces to the slaves who bore the torches before him.  He was so very happy.  Every thing had succeeded beyond his expectations:--the fate of Nitetis was as good as decided, and he held the life of Kandaules, his hated colleague, in his own hands.  Cambyses spent the night in pacing up and down his apartment.  By cock- crow he had decided that Nitetis should be forced to confess her guilt, and then be sent into the great harem to wait on the concubines.  Bartja, the destroyer of his happiness, should set off at once for Egypt, and on his return become the satrap of some distant provinces.  He did not wish to incur the guilt of a brother's murder, but he knew his own temper too well not to fear that in a moment of sudden anger, he might kill one he hated so much, and therefore wished to remove him out of the reach of his passion.  Two hours after the sun had risen,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5455"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 06 (#3)"],["body","was riding on his fiery steed, far in front of a Countless train of followers armed with shields, swords, lances, bows and lassos, in pursuit of the game which was to be found in the immense preserves near Babylon, and was to be started from its lair by more than a thousand dogs.       [The same immense trains of followers of course accompanied the      kings on their hunting expeditions, as on their journeys.  As the      Persian nobility were very fond of hunting, their boys were taught      this sport at an early age.  According to Strabo, kings themselves      boasted of having been mighty hunters in the inscriptions on their      tombs.  A relief has been found m the ruins of Persepolis, on which      the king is strangling a lion with his right arm, but this is      supposed to have a historical, not a symbolical meaning.  Similar      representations occur on Assyrian monuments.  Izdubar strangling a      lion and fighting with a lion (relief at Khorsabad) is admirably      copied in Delitzsch's edition of G.  Smith's Chaldean Genesis.      Layard discovered some representations of hunting-scenes during his      excavations; as, for instance, stags and wild boars among the reeds;      and the Greeks often mention the immense troops of followers on      horse and foot who attended the kings of Persia when they went      hunting.  According to Xenophon, Cyrop. I.  2.  II. 4. every hunter      was obliged to be armed with a bow and arrows, two lances, sword and      shield.  In Firdusi's Book of Kings we read that the lasso was also      a favorite weapon.  Hawking was well known to the Persians more than      900 years ago.  Book of Kabus XVIII.  p.  495.  The boomerang was      used in catching birds as well by the Persians as by the ancient      Egyptians and the present savage tribes of New Holland.]     CHAPTER II.  The hunt was over.  Waggons full of game, amongst which were several enormous wild boars killed by the king's own hand, were driven home behind the sports men.  At the palace-gates the latter dispersed to their several abodes, in order to exchange the simple Persian leather hunting- costume for the splendid Median court-dress.  In the course of the day's sport Cambyses had (with difficulty restraining his agitation) given his brother the seemingly kind order to start the next day for Egypt in order to fetch Sappho and accompany her to Persia.  At the same time he assigned him the revenues of Bactra, Rhagae and Sinope for the maintenance of his new household, and to his young wife, all the duties levied from her native town Phocaea, as pin- money.  Bartja thanked his generous brother with undisguised warmth, but Cambyses remained cold as ice, uttered a few farewell words, and then, riding off in pursuit of a wild ass, turned his back upon him.  On the way home from the chase the prince invited his bosom-friends Croesus, Darius, Zopyrus and Gyges to drink a parting-cup with him.  Croesus promised to join them later, as he had promised to visit the blue lily at the rising of the Tistarstar.  He had been to the hanging-gardens that morning early to visit Nitetis, but had been refused entrance by the guards, and the blue lily seemed now to offer him another chance of seeing and speaking to his beloved pupil. He wished for this very much, as he could not thoroughly understand her behavior the day before, and was uneasy at the strict watch set over her.  The young Achaemenidae sat cheerfully talking together in the twilight in a shady bower in the royal gardens, cool fountains plashing round them. Araspes, a Persian of high rank, who had been one of Cyrus's friends, had joined them, and did full justice to the prince's excellent wine.  \"Fortunate Bartja!\" cried the old bachelor, \"going out to a golden country to fetch the woman you love; while I, miserable old fellow, am blamed by everybody, and totter to my grave without wife or children to weep for me and pray the gods to be merciful to my poor soul.\"  \"Why think of such things?\"  cried Zopyrus, flourishing the wine-cup. \"There's no woman so perfect that her husband does not, at least once a day, repent that he ever took a wife.  Be merry, old friend, and remember that it's all your own fault.  If you thought a wife would make you happy, why did not you do as I have done?  I am only twenty-two years old and have five stately wives and a troop of the most beautiful slaves in my house.\"  Araspes smiled bitterly.  \"And what hinders you from marrying now?\"  said Gyges.  \"You are a match for many a younger man in appearance, strength, courage and perseverance. You are one of the king's nearest relations too--I tell you, Araspes, you might have twenty young and beautiful wives.\"  \"Look after your own affairs,\" answered Araspes.  \"In your place, I certainly should not have waited to marry till I was thirty.\"  \"An oracle has forbidden my marrying.\"  \"Folly?  how can a sensible man care for what an oracle says?  It is only by dreams, that the gods announce the future to men.  I should have thought that your own father was example enough of the shameful way in which those lying priests deceive their best friends.\"  \"That is a matter which you do not understand, Araspes.\"  \"And never wish to, boy, for you only believe in oracles because you don't understand them, and in your short-sightedness call everything that is beyond your comprehension a miracle.  And you place more confidence in anything that seems to you miraculous, than in the plain simple truth that lies before your face.  An oracle deceived your father and plunged him into ruin, but the oracle is miraculous, and so you too, in perfect confidence, allow it to rob you of happiness!\"  \"That is blasphemy, Araspes.  Are the gods to be blamed because we misunderstand their words?\"  \"Certainly: for if they wished to benefit us they would give us, with the words, the necessary penetration for discovering their meaning.  What good does a beautiful speech do me, if it is in a foreign language that I do not understand?\"  \"Leave off this useless discussion,\" said Darius, \"and tell us instead, Araspes, how it is that, though you congratulate every man on becoming a bridegroom, you yourself have so long submitted to be blamed by the priests, slighted at all entertainments and festivals, and abused by the women, only because you choose to live and die a bachelor?\"  Araspes looked down thoughtfully, then shook himself, took a long draught from the wine-cup, and said, \"I have my reasons, friends, but I cannot tell them now.\"  \"Tell them, tell them,\" was the answer.  \"No, children, I cannot, indeed I cannot.  This cup I drain to the health of the charming Sappho, and this second to your good fortune, my favorite, Darius.\"  \"Thanks, Araspes!\"  exclaimed Bartja, joyfully raising his goblet to his lips.  \"You mean well, I know,\" muttered Darius, looking down gloomily.  \"What's this, you son of Hystaspes?\"  cried the old man, looking more narrowly at the serious face of the youth.  \"Dark looks like these don't sit well on a betrothed lover, who is to drink to the health of his dearest one.  Is not Gobryas' little daughter the noblest of all the young Persian girls after Atossa? and isn't she beautiful?\"  \"Artystone has every talent and quality that a daughter of the Achaemenidae ought to possess,\" was Darius's answer, but his brow did not clear as he said the words.  \"Well, if you want more than that, you must be very hard to please.\"  Darius raised his goblet and looked down into the wine.  \"The boy is in love, as sure as my name is Araspes!\"  exclaimed the elder man.  \"What a set of foolish fellows you are,\" broke in Zopyrus at this exclamation.  \"One of you has remained a bachelor in defiance of all Persian customs; another has been frightened out of marrying by an oracle; Bartja has determined to be content with only one wife; and Darius looks like a Destur chanting the funeral-service, because his father has told him to make himself happy with the most beautiful and aristocratic girl in Persia!\"  \"Zopyrus is right,\" cried Araspes.  \"Darius is ungrateful to fortune.\"  Bartja meanwhile kept his eyes fixed on the friend, who was thus blamed by the others.  He saw that their jests annoyed him, and feeling his own great happiness doubly in that moment, pressed Darius's hand, saying: \"I am so sorry that I cannot be present at your wedding.  By the time I come back, I hope you will be reconciled to your father's choice.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Darius, \"I may be able to show a second and even a third wife by that time.\"  \"Anahita\" grant it!\"  exclaimed Zopyrus.  \"The Achaemenidae would soon become extinct, if every one were to follow such examples as Gyges and Araspes have set us.  And your one wife, Bartja, is really not worth talking about.  It is your duty to marry three wives at once, in order to keep up your father's family--the race of Cyrus.\"  \"I hate our custom of marrying many wives,\" answered Bartja.  \"Through doing this, we make ourselves inferior to the women, for we expect them to remain faithful to us all our lives, and we, who are bound to respect truth and faithfulness above every thing else, swear inviolable love to one woman to-day, and to another to-morrow.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  cried Zopyrus.  \"I'd rather lose my tongue than tell a he to a man, but our wives are so awfully deceitful, that one has no choice but to pay them back in their own coin.\"  \"The Greek women are different,\" said Bartja, \"because they are differently treated.  Sappho told me of one, I think her name was Penelope, who waited twenty years faithfully and lovingly for her husband, though every one believed he was dead, and she had fifty lovers a day at her house.\"  \"My wives would not wait so long for me,\" said Zopyrus laughing.  \"To tell the truth, I don't think I should be sorry to find an empty house, if I came back after twenty years.  For then I could take some new wives into my harem, young and beautiful, instead of the"]]]
