The friends gazed at each other in astonishment, as they read this commission.  What could induce Antony to give so strange an order?  How did it fall into the hands of the pirates?  This must be understood.  When Archibius, whose gentle nature, so well adapted to inspire confidence, quickly won friends, burst into passionate excitement, the unexpected transition rarely failed to produce its effect, especially as his tall, strong figure and marked features made a still more threatening impression.  Even the captain gazed at him with fear, when the Alexandrian threatened to recall all his promises of consideration and mercy if the pirate withheld even the smallest trifle connected with this letter.  The man speedily perceived that it would be useless to make false statements; for the captive from Pontus, though unable to speak Greek, understood the language, and either confirmed every remark of the other with vehement gestures, or branded it in the same manner as false.  Thus it was discovered that the pirate craft, in company with a much larger vessel, owned by a companion, had lurked behind the promontory of Crete for a prize.  They had neither seen nor heard aught concerning the two fleets, when a dainty galley, \"the finest and fleetest that ever sailed in the sea\"--it was  probably the \"Swallow,\" Antony's despatch- boat-had run into the snare.  To capture her was an easy task.  The pirates had divided their booty, but the lion's share of goods and men had fallen to the larger ship.  A pouch containing letters and money had been taken from a gentleman of aristocratic appearance--probably Antony's messenger--who had received a severe wound, died, and had been flung into the sea.  The former had been used to light the fire, and only the one addressed to the architect remained.  The captured sailors had said that the fleet of Octavianus had defeated Cleopatra's, and the Queen had fled, but that the land forces were still untouched, and might yet decide the conflict in Antony's favour.  The pirate protested that he did not know the position of the army--it might be at Taenarum, whence the captured ship came.  It was a sin and a shame, but his own crew had set it on fire, and it sank before his eyes.  This report seemed to be true, yet the Acharnanian coast, where the battle was said to have been fought, was so far from the southern point of the Peloponnesus, whence Antony's letter came, that it must have been written during the flight.  One thing appeared to be certain--the fleet had been vanquished and dispersed on the 2d or 3d of September.  Where would the Queen go now?  What had become of the magnificent galleys which had accompanied her to the battle?  Even the contrary winds would not have detained them so long, for they were abundantly supplied with rowers.  Had Octavianus taken possession of them?  Were they burned or sunk?  But in that case how had Antony reached Taenarum?  The pirate could give no answer to these questions, which stirred both heart and brain.  Why should he conceal what had reached his ears?  At last Archibius ordered the property stolen from Antony's ship, and the liberated sailor to be brought on board the Epicurus, but the pirate was obliged to swear not to remain in the waters between Crete and Alexandria.  Then he was suffered to pursue his way unmolested.  This adventure had occupied many hours, and the return against the wind was slow; for, during the chase the Epicurus had been carried by the strong breeze far out to sea.  Yet, when still several miles from the mouth of the harbour at the Pharos, it was evident that the Rhodian helmsman in the island tavern had predicted truly; for the weather changed with unusual speed, and the wind now blew from the north.  The sea fairly swarmed with ships, some belonging to the royal fleet, some to curious Alexandrians, who had sailed out to take a survey.  Archibius and Dion had spent a sleepless night and day.  The heavy air, pervaded by a fine mist, had grown cool.  After refreshing themselves by a repast, they paced up and down the deck of the Epicurus.  Few words were exchanged, and they wrapped their cloaks closer around them.  Both had quaffed large draughts of the fiery wine with which the Epicurus was well supplied, but it would not warm them.  Even the fire, blazing brightly in the richly furnished cabin, could scarcely do so.  Archibius's thoughts lingered with his beloved Queen, and his vivid power of imagination conjured before his mind everything which could distress her.  No possible chance, not even the most terrible, was forgotten, and when he saw her sinking in the ship, stretching her beautiful arms imploringly towards him, to whom she had so long turned in every perilous position, when he beheld her a captive in the presence of the hostile, cold-hearted Octavianus, the blood seemed to freeze in his veins.  At last he dropped his felt mantle and, groaning aloud, struck his brow with his clenched hand.  He had fancied her walking with gold chains on her slender wrists before the victor's four-horse chariot, and heard the exulting shouts of the Roman populace.  That would have been the most terrible of all.  To pursue this train of thought was beyond the endurance of the faithful friend, and Dion turned in surprise as he heard him sob and saw the tears which bedewed his face.  His own heart was heavy enough, but he knew his companion's warm devotion to the Queen; so, passing his arm around his shoulder, he entreated him to maintain that peace of soul and mind which he had so often admired. In the most critical situations he had seen him stand high above them, as yonder man who fed the flames on the summit of the Pharos stood above the wild surges of the sea.  If he would reflect over what had happened as dispassionately as usual, he could not fail to see that Antony must be free and in a position to guide his own future, since he directed the palace in the Choma to be put in order.  He did not understand about the wall, but perhaps he was bringing home some distinguished captive whom he wished to debar from all communication with the city.  It might prove that everything was far better than they feared, and they would yet smile at these grievous anxieties.  His heart, too, was heavy, for he wished the Queen the best fortune, not only for her own sake, but because with her and her successful resistance to the greed of Rome was connected the liberty of Alexandria.  \"My love and anxiety, like yours,\" he concluded, \"have ever been given to her, the sovereign of this country.  The world will be desolate, life will no longer be worth living, if the iron foot of Rome crushes our independence and freedom.\"  The words had sounded cordial and sincere, and Archibius followed Dion's counsel.  Calm thought convinced him that nothing had yet happened which compelled belief in the worst result; and, as one who needs consolation often finds relief in comforting another, Archibius cheered his own heart by representing to his younger friend that, even if Octavianus were the victor and should deprive Egypt of her independence, he would scarcely venture to take from the citizens of Alexandria the free control of their own affairs.  Then he explained to Dion that, as a young, resolute, independent man, he might render himself doubly useful if it were necessary to guard the endangered liberty of the city, and told him how many beautiful things life still held in store.  His voice expressed anxious tenderness for his young friend.  No one had spoken thus to Dion since his father's death.  The Epicurus would soon reach the mouth of the harbour, and after landing he must again leave Archibius.  The decisive hour which often unites earnest men more firmly than many previous years had come to both.  They had opened their hearts to each other.  Dion had withheld only the one thing which, at the first sight of the houses in the city, filled his soul with fresh uneasiness.  It was long since he had sought counsel from others.  Many who had asked his, had left him with thanks, to do exactly the opposite of what he had advised, though it would have been to their advantage.  More than once he, too, had done the same, but now a powerful impulse urged him to confide in Archibius.  He knew Barine, and wished her the greatest happiness.  Perhaps it would be wise to let another person, who was kindly disposed, consider what his own heart so eagerly demanded and prudence forbade.  Hastily forming his resolution, he again turned to his friend, saying:  \"You have shown yourself a father to me.  Imagine that I am indeed your son, and, as such wished to confess that a woman had become dear to my heart, and to ask whether you would be glad to greet her as a daughter.\"  Here Archibius interrupted him with the exclamation: \"A ray of light amid all this gloom?  Grasp what you have too long neglected as soon as possible!  It befits a good citizen to marry.  The Greek does not attain full manhood till he becomes husband and father.  If I have remained unwedded, there was a special reason for it, and how often I have envied the cobbler whom I saw standing before his shop in the evening, holding his child in his arms, or the pilot, to whom large and small hands were stretched in greeting when he returned home!  When I enter my dwelling only my dogs rejoice.  But you, whose beautiful palace stands empty, to whose proud family it is due that you should provide for its continuance--\"  \"That is just what brings me into a state of indecision, which is usually foreign to my nature,\" interrupted Dion.  \"You know me and my position in the world, and you have also known from her earliest childhood the woman to whom I allude.\"  \"Iras?\"  asked  his  companion, hesitatingly.  His sister, Charmian, had told him of the love felt by the Queen's younger waiting-woman.  But Dion eagerly denied"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5475"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 03 (#5)"],["body","his, adding  I am speaking of Barine, the daughter of your dead friend Leonax.  I love her, yet my pride is sensitive, and I know that it will extend to my future wife.  The contemptuous glances which others might cast at her I should scorn, for I know her worth.  Surely you remember my mother: she was a very different woman.  Her house, her child, the slaves, her loom, were everything to her.  She rigidly exacted from other women the chaste reserve which was a marked trait in her own character.  Yet she was gentle, and loved me, her only son, beyond aught else.  I think she would have opened her arms to Barine, had she believed that she was necessary to my happiness.  But would the young beauty, accustomed to gay intercourse with distinguished men, have been able to submit to her demands?  When I consider that she cannot help taking into her married life the habit of being surrounded and courted; when I think that the imprudence of a woman accustomed to perfect freedom might set idle tongues in motion, and cast a shadow upon the radiant purity of my name; when I even--\" and he raised his clenched right hand.  But Archibius answered soothingly:  \"That anxiety is groundless if Barine warmly and joyfully gives you her whole heart.  It is a sunny, lovable, true woman's heart, and therefore capable of a great love.  If she bestows it on you--and I believe she will--go and offer sacrifices in your gratitude; for the immortals desired your happiness when they guided your choice to her and not to Iras, my own sister's child.  If you were really my son, I would now exclaim, 'You could not bring me a dearer daughter, if--I repeat it-- if you are sure of her love.'\"  Dion gazed into vacancy a short time, and then cried firmly: \"I am!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  The Epicurus anchored before the Temple of Poseidon.  The crew had been ordered to keep silence, though they knew nothing, except that a letter from Antony, commanding the erection of a wall, had been found on board the pirate.  This might be regarded as a good omen, for people do not think of building unless they anticipate a time of peace.  The light rain had ceased, but the wind blew more strongly from the north, and the air had grown cool.  A dense throng still covered the quay from the southern end of the Heptastadium to the promontory of Lochias. The strongest pressure was between the peninsula of the Choma and the Sebasteum; for this afforded a view of the sea, and the first tidings must reach the residence of the Regent, which was connected with the palace.  A hundred contradictory rumours had been in circulation that morning; and when, at the third hour in the afternoon, the Epicurus arrived, it was surrounded by a dense multitude eager to hear what news the ship had brought from without.  Other vessels shared the same fate, but none could give reliable tidings.  Two swift galleys from the royal fleet reported meeting a Samian trireme, which had given news of a great victory gained by Antony on the land and Cleopatra on the sea, and, as men are most ready to believe what they desire, throngs of exulting men and women moved to and fro along the shore, strengthening by their confidence many a timorous spirit.  Prudent people, who had regarded the long delay of the first ships of the fleet with anxiety, had opened their ears to the tales of evil, and looked forward to the future with uneasiness.  But they avoided giving expression to their fears, for the overseer of an establishment for gold embroidery, who had ventured to warn the people against premature rejoicing, had limped home badly beaten, and two other pessimists who had been flung in the sea had just been dragged out dripping wet.  Nor could the multitude be blamed for this confidence; for at the Serapeum, the theatre of Dionysus, the lofty pylons of the Sebasteum, the main door of the museum, in front of the entrance of the palace in the Bruchium, and before the fortress-like palaces in the Lochias, triumphal arches had been erected, adorned with gods of victory and trophies hastily constructed of plaster, inscriptions of congratulations and thanks to the deities, garlands of foliage and flowers.  The wreathing of the Egyptian pylons and obelisks, the principal temple, and the favourite statues in the city had been commenced during the night.  The last touches were now being given to the work.  Gorgias, like his friend Dion, had not closed his eyes since the night before; for he had had charge of all the decorations of the Bruchium, where one superb building adjoined another.  Sleep had also fled from the couches of the occupants of the Sebasteum, the royal palace where Iras lived during the absence of the Queen, and the practorium, facing its southern front, which contained the official residence of the Regent.  When Archibius was conducted to the Queen's waiting-woman, her appearance fairly startled him.  She had been his guest in Kanopus only the day before yesterday, and how great was the alteration within this brief time!  Her oval face seemed to have lengthened, the features to have grown sharper; and this woman of seven-and-twenty years, who had hitherto retained all the charms of youth, appeared suddenly to have aged a decade.  There was a feverish excitement in her manner, as, holding out her hand to her uncle, in greeting, she exclaimed hastily, \"You, too, bring no good tidings?\"  \"Nor any evil ones,\" he answered quietly.  \"But, child, I do not like your appearance--the dark circles under your keen eyes.  You have had news which rouses your anxiety?\"  \"Worse than that,\" she answered in a low tone.  \"Well?\"  \"Read!\" gasped  Iras, her lips and nostrils quivering as she handed Archibius a small tablet.  With a gesture of haste very unusual in him, he snatched it from her hand and, as his eyes ran over the words traced upon it, every vestige of colour vanished from his cheeks and lips.  They were written by Cleopatra's own hand, and contained the following lines:  \"The naval battle was lost--and by my fault.  The land forces might still save us, but not under his command.  He is with me, uninjured, but apparently exhausted; like a different being, bereft of courage, listless as if utterly crushed.  I foresee the beginning of the end.  As soon as this reaches you, arrange to have some unpretending litters ready for us every evening at sunset.  Make the people believe that we have conquered until trustworthy intelligence arrives concerning the fate of Canidius and the army.  When you kiss the children in my name, be very tender with them.  Who knows how soon they may be orphaned?  They already have an unhappy mother; may they be spared the memory of a cowardly one!  Trust no one except those whom I left in authority, and Archibius, not even Caesarion or Antyllus.  Provide for having every one whose aid may be valuable to me within reach when I come.  I cannot close with the familiar 'Rejoice'--the 'Fresh Courage' placed on many a tombstone seems more appropriate.  You who did not envy me in my happiness will help me to bear misfortune.  Epicurus, who believes that the gods merely watch the destiny of men inactively from their blissful heights, is right. Were it otherwise, how could the love and loyalty which cleave to the hapless, defeated woman, be repaid with anguish of heart and tears?  Yet continue to love her.\"  Archibius, pale and silent, let the tablet fall.  It was long ere he gasped hoarsely: \"I foresaw it; yet now that it is here--\" His voice failed, and violent, tearless sobs shook his powerful frame.  Sinking on a couch he buried his face amid the cushions.  Iras gazed at the strong man and shook her head.  She, too, loved the Queen; the news had brought tears to her eyes also; but even while she wept, a host of plans coping with this disaster had darted through her restless brain.  A few minutes after the arrival of the message of misfortune she had consulted with the members of Cleopatra's council, and adopted measures for sustaining the people's belief in the naval victory.  What was she, the delicate, by no means courageous girl, compared to this man of iron strength who, she was well aware, had braved the greatest perils in the service of the Queen?  Yet there he lay with his face hidden in the pillows as if utterly overwhelmed.  Did a woman's soul rebound more quickly after being crushed beneath the burdens of the heaviest suffering, or was hers of a special character, and her slender body the casket of a hero's nature?  She had reason to believe so when she recalled how the Regent and the Keeper of the Seal had received the terrible news.  They had rushed frantically up and down the vast hall as if desperate; but Mardion the eunuch had little manhood, and Zeno was a characterless old author who had won the Queen's esteem, and the high office which he occupied solely by the vivid power of imagination, that enabled him constantly to devise new exhibitions, amusements, and entertainments, and present them with magical splendour.  But Archibius, the brave, circumspect counsellor and helper?  His shoulders again quivered as if they had received a blow, and Iras suddenly remembered what she had long known, but never fully realized-- that yonder grey-haired man loved Cleopatra, loved her as she herself loved Dion; and she wondered whether she would have been strong enough to maintain her composure if she had learned that a cruel fate threatened to rob him of life, liberty, and honour.  Hour after hour she had vainly awaited the young Alexandrian, yet he had witnessed her anxiety the day before.  Had she offended him?  Was he detained by the spell of Didymus's granddaughter?  It seemed a great wrong that, amid the unspeakably terrible misfortune which had overtaken her mistress, she could not refrain from thinking continually of Dion.  Even as his image filled her heart, Cleopatra's ruled her uncle's mind and soul, and she said to herself that it was not alone among women that love paid"]]]
