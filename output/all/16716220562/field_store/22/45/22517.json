That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the great trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the bugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent, stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops. It was that of Judge Whipple. He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first of many to be laid on Richter's grave.  Poor Richter! How sad his life had been! And yet he had not filled it with sadness. For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look upon his empty place without a pang. He missed the cheery songs and the earnest presence even more than he had thought. Carl Richter,--as his father before him,--had lived for others. Both had sacrificed their bodies for a cause. One of them might be pictured as he trudged with Father Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering at sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant Napoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time, his wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a thankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena. Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar. In Carl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred. His, too, had been the sacrifice. Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate that great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the oppressed.     CHAPTER IV  THE LIST OF SIXTY  One chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window. Her eye was caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched over them. One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame. They were pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel. On the seat a man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a ragged blanket. In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware, lay a gaunt woman in the rain. Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there. From such a picture the girl fled in tears. But the sight of it, and of others like it, haunted her for weeks. Through those last dreary days of November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes. The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been written. Still they came by the hundred, those families. Some brought little corpses to be buried. The father of one, hale and strong when they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house. The walls of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart. So could Mr. Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities. He found time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.  Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already overtaxed. All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains of articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a colored print that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.  Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit old clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention. Christmas was drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth. And many of the wanderers were unclothed and unfed.  More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men. Another general had come to St. Louis to take charge of the Department, and the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.  The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care for the refugees. A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and the verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No. 24.  \"Inasmuch,\" said the General, \"as the Secession army had driven these people from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to support them.\" He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.  Indignation was rife the day that order was published. Sixty prominent \"disloyalists\" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten thousand dollars.  \"They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent,\" cried Mr. Russell. And he meant it. This was the way the others felt. Who were to be on this mysterious list of \"Sixty\"? That was the all-absorbing question of the town. It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous ones. Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr. Catherwood and Mr. Russell and Mr. James, and Mr. Worington the lawyer. Mrs. Addison Colfax lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared would break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries, gave her niece not a little amusement. For Virginia was human, and one morning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the newspaper:-- \"For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand dollar list.\"  \"Jinny,\" she cried, \"how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when you know that I am in a state of frenzy now? How does that relieve me? It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to pay. We are the only women of importance in the city.\"  That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to Bellegarde. Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were left in the big house. Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been hired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running, long-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.  Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell. Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or pacing the floor restlessly. His occupation was gone. He was observed night and day by Federal detectives. Virginia strove to amuse him, to conceal her anxiety as she watched him. Well she knew that but for her he would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of the night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go. Ten years had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.  All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of Christmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the store, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily into the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson. The Captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he would confide to Ned with a knowing wink. And then the house would be lighted from top to bottom, and Mr. Russell and Mr. Catherwood and Mr. Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr. Carvel over great bowls of apple toddy and egg-nog. And Virginia would have her own friends in the big parlor. That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.  Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his Christmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house. Virginia pictured him this year at Mrs. Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss them as much as they missed him. War may break friendships, but it cannot take away the sacredness of memories.  The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood looking out of the sitting-room window. A man's figure muffled in a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes. Virginia started. It was the same United States deputy marshal she had seen the day before at Mr. Russell's house.  \"Pa,\" she cried, \"do you think he is coming here?\"  \"I reckon so, honey.\"  \"The brute! Are you going to pay?\"  \"No, Jinny.\"  \"Then they will take away the furniture.\"  \"I reckon they will.\"  \"Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room. It --it was mother's. I could not bear to see them take that. Let me put it in the garret.\"  The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.  \"No, Jinny. We must leave this house just as it is.\" Then he added, strangely enough for him, \"God's will be done.\"  The bell rang sharply. And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with his apron on.  \"Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?\"  The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself. He was an imposing figure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy. Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs. Then she came out and stood beside her father.  \"Are you Colonel Carvel?\"  \"I reckon I am. Will you come in?\"  The officer took off his cap. He was a young man with a smooth face, and a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia. He did not appear to relish the duty thrust upon him. He fumbled in his coat and drew from his inner pocket a paper.  \"Colonel Carvel,\" said he, \"by order of Major General Halleck, I serve you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars for the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven from their homes. In default of payment within a reasonable time such personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will satisfy the demand against you.\"  The Colonel took the paper. \"Very well, sir,\" he said. \"You may tell the General that the articles may be seized. That I will not, while in my right mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me.\"  It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to dinner. The deputy marvelled. He had gone into many houses that week; had seen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5393"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 06 (#8)"],["body","ndignation, hysterics, frenzy. He had even heard men and women whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their loyalty to the Union. But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl who had stood silent beside them, were new. He bowed, and casting his eyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.  The Colonel shut the door. Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully pulled his goatee, and laughed gently. \"Lordy, we haven't got three hundred and fifty dollars to our names,\" said he.  The climate of St. Louis is capricious. That fierce valley of the Missouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is sometimes quiet. Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet melts, and windows are opened. In those days the streets will be fetlock deep in soft mud. It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor anything.  It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van, accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr. Carvel's house. Eugenie, watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his French ancestors.  Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply filling its place. Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance hard to describe sat on her honest black face.  \"Is this Colonel Carvel's house?\"  \"Yassir. I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me.\" An embarrassed silence, and then from Mammy, \"Whaffor you laffin at?\"  \"Is the Colonel at home?\"  \"Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't. Ef he was, you ain't come here 'quirin' in dat honey voice.\" (Raising her own voice.) \"You tink I dunno whaffor you come? You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an' to steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n. You come heah when young Marse ain't to home ter rob him.\" (Still louder.) \"Ned, whaffor you hidin' yonder? Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over Marse Comyn's gun.\"  The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled by this unexpected resistance. Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort.  \"Is your mistress here?\"  This question was unfortunate in the extreme.  \"You--you white trash!\" cried Mammy, bursting with indignation. \"Who is you to come heah 'quiring fo' her! I ain't agwine--\"  \"Mammy!\"  \"Yas'm! Yas, Miss Jinny.\" Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at her bandanna.  \"Mammy, what is all this noise about?\" The torrent was loosed once more.  \"These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's blongin's. I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body.\"  The deputy had his foot on the threshold. He caught sight of the face of Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly.  \"I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize personal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel.\"  Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back. \"I do not see how I am to prevent you,\" she said. The deputy was plainly abashed.  \"I'm sorry, Miss. I--I can't tell you how sorry I am. But it's got to be done.\"  Virginia nodded coldly. And still the man hesitated. \"What are you waiting for?\" she said.  The deputy wiped his muddy feet. He made his men do likewise. Then he entered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around him.  \"I expect all that we want is right here,\" he said. And at the sight of the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled. Then he walked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.  The man was a musician. Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany stool, and ran his fingers over the keys. They seemed to Virginia, standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.  The piano, too, had been her mother's. It had once stood in the brick house of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale. The songs of Beatrice lay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by. No more, of an evening when they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play them over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his cigar, --dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl who held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his side. And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had played them for him on this piano. Often he had told Virginia of those days, and walked with her over those paths.  The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck. Virginia stirred. For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter.  \"Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey. Dis ain't no place for us, I reckon.\" Her words were the essence of endearment. And yet, while she pronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders. \"Oh, de good Lawd'll burn de wicked!\"  The men were removing the carved legs. Virginia went back into the room and stood before the deputy.  \"Isn't there something else you could take? Some jewellery?\" She flushed. \"I have a necklace--\"  \"No, miss. This warrant's on your father. And there ain't nothing quite so salable as pianos.\"  She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away. It seemed like a coffin. Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and that was because there was a pain in her own. They took the rosewood what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could touch them, and held them in her arms. They seized the mahogany velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and, last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's parties.  She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone. It was the embodied wreck of her happiness. Ned closed the blinds once more, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the stairs.     CHAPTER V  THE AUCTION  \"Stephen,\" said the Judge, in his abrupt way, \"there isn't a great deal doing. Let's go over to the Secesh property sales.\"  Stephen looked up in surprise. The seizures and intended sale of secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in the city. There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as unjust and brutal. The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may only be surmised. Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any goods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day because it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember it.  It was not that Stephen feared ostracism. Anne Brinsmade was almost the only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances. Miss Carvel's conduct is known. The Misses Russell showed him very plainly that they disapproved of his politics. The hospitable days at that house were over. Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street, pretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod. The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners, in sentiment against forced auctions.  However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the Judge leaning on his arm. They walked for some distance in silence.  \"Stephen,\" said he, presently, \"I guess I'll do a little bidding.\"  Stephen did not reply. But he was astonished. He wondered what Mr. Whipple wanted with fine furniture. And, if he really wished to bid, Stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him.  \"You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose,\" said the Judge.  \"Yes, sir, on large grounds. War makes many harsh things necessary.\"  \"Then,\" said the Judge, tartly, \"by bidding, we help to support starving Union families. You should not be afraid to bid, sir.\"  Stephen bit his lip. Sometimes Mr. Whipple made him very angry.  \"I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple.\" He did not see the smile on the Judge's face.  \"Then you will bid in certain things for me,\" said Mr. Whipple. Here he hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench. \"Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted. Now I've got the chance to buy it cheap.\"  There was silence again, for the space of a whole block. Finally, Stephen managed to say:-- \"You'll have to excuse me, sir. I do not care to do that.\"  \"What?\" cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so that a wagon nearly ran over his toes.  \"I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir. And--\"  \"And what?\"  Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to say these things. The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart. And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street, which was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of Virginia. He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through. He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had actually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with the piano that she had played on.  The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they came to Morgan's great warerooms. A crowd blocked the pavement, and hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom they spoke to. All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's household goods. The long hall, which ran from street to street, was packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing all in a breath. The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way fiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale. In truth, it "]]]
