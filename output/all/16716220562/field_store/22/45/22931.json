She can never tell you what is hanging to a tree, and about three weeks since I asked her under a clear sky and a waning moon whether the moon had been shining the evening before and she could not tell me, though she had been sitting out of doors with the others till quite late, evening after evening.  I have noticed, too, that she scarcely recognizes men who are rather tall, though she may have seen them three or four times.  Her standard has fallen short-like her leg.  Now, am I right or wrong?\"  \"In this instance you are right,\" replied Philippus, \"still, I know some lame people. . .\"  And again words ran high between the friends; Pulcheria, however, put an end to the discussion this time, by exclaiming enthusiastically:  \"Baste is the best and most good-natured soul in the whole house!\"  \"Because she looks into her own heart,\" replied Rufinus.  \"She knows herself; and, because she knows how painful pain is, she treats others tenderly.  Do you remember, Philippus, how we disputed after that anatomical lecture we heard together at Caesarea?\"  \"Perfectly well,\" said the leech, \"and later life has but confirmed the opinion I then held.  There is no less true or less just saying than the Latin motto: 'Mens sana in corpore sano,' as it is generally interpreted to mean that a healthy soul is only to be found in a healthy body.  As the expression of a wish it may pass, but I have often felt inclined to doubt even that.  It has been my lot to meet with a strength of mind, a hopefulness, and a thankfulness for the smallest mercies in the sickliest bodies, and at the same time a delicacy of feeling, a wise reserve, and an undeviating devotion to lofty things such as I have never seen in a healthy frame.  The body is but the tenement of the soul, and just as we find righteous men and sinners, wise men and fools, alike in the palace and the hovel--nay, and often see truer worth in a cottage than in the splendid mansions of the great--so we may discover noble souls both in the ugly and the fair, in the healthy and the infirm, and most frequently, perhaps, in the least vigorous.  We should be careful how we go about repeating such false axioms, for they can only do harm to those who have a heavy burthen to bear through life as it is.  In my opinion a hunchback's thoughts are as straightforward as an athlete's; or do you imagine that if a mother were to place her new-born children in a spiral chamber and let them grow up in it, they could not tend upwards as all men do by nature?\"  \"Your comparison limps,\" cried Rufinus, \"and needs setting to rights. If we are not to find ourselves in open antagonism. . . .\"  \"You must keep the peace,\" Joanna put in addressing her husband; and before Rufinus could retort, Paula had asked him with frank simplicity:  \"How old are you, my worthy host?\"  \"Your arrival at my house blessed the second day of my seventieth year,\" replied Rufinus with a courteous bow.  His wife shook her finger at him, exclaiming:  \"I wonder whether you have not a secret hump?  Such fine phrases. . .\"  \"He is catching the style from his cripples,\" said Paula laughing at him. \"But now it is your turn, friend Philippus.  Your exposition was worthy of an antique sage, and it struck me--for the sake of Rufinus here I will not say convinced me.  I respect you--and yet I should like to know how old.  .  .  .\"  \"I shall soon be thirty-one,\" said Philippus, anticipating her question.  \"That is an honest answer,\" observed Dame Joanna.  \"At your age many a man clings to his twenties.\"  \"Why?\"  asked Pulcheria.  \"Well,\" said her mother, \"only because there are some girls who think a man of thirty too old to be attractive.\"  \"Stupid  creatures,\"  answered  Pulcheria.  \"Let them find me a young man who is more lovable than my father; and if Philippus--yes you, Philippus--were ten or twenty years over nine and twenty, would that make you less clever or kind?\"  \"Not less ugly, at any rate,\" said the physician.  Pulcheria laughed, but with some annoyance, as though she had herself been the object of the remark.  \"You are not a bit ugly!\"  she exclaimed.  \"Any one who says so has no eyes.  And you will hear nothing said of you but that you are a tall, fine man!\"  As the warm-hearted girl thus spoke, defending her friend against himself, Paula stroked her golden hair and added to the physician:  \"Pulcheria's father is so far right that she, at any rate, measures men by a true and straight standard.  Note that, Philippus!--But do not take my questioning ill.--I cannot help wondering how a man of one and thirty and one of seventy should have been studying in the high schools at the same time?  The moon will not be eclipsed for a long time yet--how bright and clear it is!--So you, Rufinus, who have wandered so far through the wide world, if you would do me a great pleasure, will tell us something of your past life and how you came to settle in Memphis.\"  \"His history?\"  cried Joanna.  \"If he were to tell it, in all its details from beginning to end, the night would wane and breakfast would get cold. He has had as many adventures as travelled Odysseus.  But tell us something husband; you know there is nothing we should like better.\"  \"I must be off to my duties,\" said the leech, and when he had taken a friendly leave of the others and bidden farewell to Paula with less effusiveness than of late, Rufinus began his story.  \"I was born in Alexandria, where, at that time, commerce and industry still flourished.  My father was an armorer; above two hundred slaves and free laborers were employed in his work-shops.  He required the finest metal, and commonly procured it by way of Massilia from Britain.  On one occasion he himself went to that remote island in a friend's ship, and he there met my mother.  Her ruddy gold hair, which Pul has inherited, seems to have bewitched him and, as the handsome foreigner pleased her well-- for men like my father are hard to match nowadays--she turned Christian for his sake and came home with him.  They neither of them ever regretted it; for though she was a quiet woman, and to her dying day spoke Greek like a foreigner, the old man often said she was his best counsellor. At the same time she was so soft-hearted, that she could not bear that any living creature should suffer, and though she looked keenly after everything at the hearth and loom, she could never see a fowl, a goose, or a pig slaughtered.  And I have inherited her weakness--shall I say 'alas!' or 'thank God?'  \"I had two elder brothers who both had to help my father, and who were to carry on the business.  When I was ten years old my calling was decided on.  My mother would have liked to make a priest of me and at that time I should have consented joyfully; but my father would not agree, and as we had an uncle who was making a great deal of money as a Rhetor, my father accepted a proposal from him that I should devote myself to that career. So I went from one teacher to another and made good progress in the schools.  \"Till my twentieth year I continued to live with my parents, and during my many hours of leisure I was free to do or leave undone whatever I had a fancy for; and this was always something medical, if that is not too big a word.  I was but a lad of twelve when this fancy first took me, and that through pure accident.  Of course I was fond of wandering about the workshops, and there they kept a magpie, a quaint little bird, which my mother had fed out of compassion.  It could say 'Blockhead,' and call my name and a few other words, and it seemed to like the noise, for it always would fly off to where the smiths were hammering and filing their loudest, and whenever it perched close to one of the anvils there were sure to be mirthful faces over the shaping and scraping and polishing. For many years its sociable ways made it a favorite; but one day it got caught in a vice and its left leg was broken.  Poor little creature!\"  The old man stooped to wipe his eyes unseen, but he went on without pausing:  \"It fell on its back and looked at me so pathetically that I snatched the tongs out of the bellows-man's hand--for he was going to put an end to its sufferings in all kindness--and, picking it up gently, I made up my mind I would cure it.  Then I carried the bird into my own room, and to keep it quiet that it might not hurt itself, I tied it down to a frame that I contrived, straightened its little leg, warmed the injured bone by sucking it, and strapped it to little wooden splints.  And behold it really set: the bird got quite well and fluttered about the workshops again as sound as before, and whenever it saw me it would perch upon my shoulder and peck very gently at my hair with its sharp beak.  \"From that moment I could have found it in me to break the legs of every hen in the yard, that I might set them again; but I thought of something better.  I went to the barbers and told them that if any one had a bird, a dog, or a cat, with a broken limb, he might bring it to me, and that I was prepared to cure all these injuries gratis; they might tell all their customers.  The very next day I had a patient brought me: a black hound, with tan spots over his eyes, whose leg had been smashed by a badly-aimed spear: I can see him now!  Others followed; feathered or four-footed sufferers; and this was the beginning of my surgical career.  The invalid birds on the trees I still owe to my old allies the barbers.  I only occasionally take beasts in hand.  The lame children, whom you saw in the garden, come to me from poor parents who cannot afford a surgeon's aid. The merry, curly-headed boy who brought you a rose just now is to go home again in a few days.--But to return to the story of my youth.  \"The more serious events which gave my life this particular bias occurred in my twentieth year, when I had already left even the high school behind me; nor was I fully carried away by their influence till after my uncle had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5522"],["title","The Bride of the Nile â€” Volume 06 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      THE BRIDE OF THE NILE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 6.    CHAPTER XXII.  Up to within a few days Katharina had still been a dependent and docile child, who had made it a point of honor to obey instantly, not only her mother's lightest word, but Dame Neforis, too; and, since her own Greek instructress had been dismissed, even the acid Eudoxia.  She had never concealed from her mother, or the worthy teacher whom she had truly loved, the smallest breach of rules, the least naughtiness or wilful act of which she had been guilty; nay, she had never been able to rest till she had poured out a confession, before evening prayer, of all that her little heart told her was not perfectly right, to some one whom she loved, and obtained full forgiveness.  Night after night the \"Water- wagtail\" had gone to sleep with a conscience as clear and as white as the breast of her whitest dove, and the worst sin she had ever committed during the day was some forbidden scramble, some dainty or, more frequently, some rude and angry word.  But a change had first come over her after Orion's kiss in the intoxicating perfume of the flowering trees; and almost every hour since had roused her to new hopes and new views.  It had never before occurred to her to criticise or judge her mother; now she was constantly doing so. The way in which Susannah had cut herself off from her neighbors in the governor's house, to her daughter seemed perverse and in bad taste; and the bitterly vindictive attacks on her old friends, which were constantly on Susannah's lips, aggrieved the girl, and finally set her in opposition to her mother, whose judgment had hitherto seemed to her infallible. Thus, when the governor's house was closed against her, there was no one in whom she cared to confide, for a barrier stood between her and Paula, and she was painfully conscious of its height each time the wish to pass it recurred to her mind.  Paula was certainly \"that other\" of whom Orion had spoken; when she had stolen away to see her in the evening after the funeral, she had been prompted less by a burning wish to pour out her heart to a sympathizing hearer, than by torturing curiosity mingled with jealousy.  She had crept through the hedge with a strangely-mixed feeling of tender longing and sullen hatred; when they had met in the garden she had at first given herself up to the full delight of being free to speak, and of finding a listener in a woman so much her superior; but Paula's reserved replies to her bold questioning had revived her feelings of envy and grudge.  Any one who did not hate Orion must, she was convinced, love him.  Were they not perhaps already pledged to each other!  Very likely Paula had thought of her as merely a credulous child, and so had concealed the fact!  This \"very likely\" was torture to her, and she was determined to try, at any rate, to settle the doubt.  She had an ally at her command; this was her foster-brother, the son of her deaf old nurse; she knew that he would blindly obey all her wishes--nay, to please her, would throw himself to the crocodiles in the Nile.  Anubis had been her comrade in all her childish sports, till at the age of fourteen, after learning to read and write, her mother had obtained an appointment for him in the governor's household, as an assistant to be further trained by the treasurer Nilus. Dame Susannah intended to find him employment at a future date on her estates, or at Memphis, the centre of their administration, as he might prove himself capable.  The lad was still living with his mother under the rich widow's roof, and only spent his working days at the governor's house, he was industrious and clever during office hours, though between whiles he busied himself with things altogether foreign to his future calling.  At Katharina's request he had opened a communication between the two houses by means of carrier-pigeons, and many missives were thus despatched with little gossip, invitations, excuses, and the like, from Katharina to Mary and back again.  Anubis took great pleasure in the pretty creatures, and by the permission of his superiors a dovecote was erected on the roof of the treasurer's house.  Mary was now lying ill, and their intercourse was at an end; still, the well-trained messengers need not be idle, and Katharina had begun to use them for a very different purpose.  Orion's envoy had been detained a long time at Rufinus' door the day before; and she had since learnt from Anubis, who was acquainted with all that took place in Nilus' office, that Paula's moneys were to be delivered over to her very shortly, and in all probability by Orion himself.  They must then have an interview, and perhaps she might succeed in overhearing it.  She knew well how this could be managed; the only thing was to be on the spot at the right moment.  On the morning after the full-moon, at two hours and a half before noon, the little boy whose task it was to feed the feathered messengers in their dove-cote brought her a written scrap, on which Anubis informed her that Orion was about to set out; but he was not very warmly welcomed, for the hour did not suit her at all.  Early in the morning Bishop Plotinus had come to inform Susannah that Benjamin, Patriarch of Alexandria, was visiting Amru on the opposite shore, and would presently honor Memphis with his presence.  He proposed to remain one day; he had begged to have no formal reception, and had left it to the bishop to find suitable quarters for himself and his escort, as he did not wish to put up at the governor's house.  The vain widow had at once pressingly urged her readiness to receive the illustrious guest under her roof: The prelate's presence must bring a blessing on the house, and she thought, too, that she might turn it to advantage for several ends she just now happened to have in view.  A handsome reception must be prepared; there were but a few hours to spare, and even before the bishop had left her, she had begun to call the servants together and give them orders.  The whole house must be turned upside down; some of the kitchen staff were hurried off into the town to make purchases, others bustled round the fire; the gardeners plundered the beds and bushes to weave wreaths and nosegays for decorations; from cellar to roof half a hundred of slaves, white, brown and black, were toiling with all their might, for each believed that, by rendering a service to the Patriarch, he might count on the special favor of Heaven, while their unresting mistress never ceased screaming out her orders as to what she wished done.  Susannah, who as a girl had been the eldest of a numerous and not wealthy family, and had been obliged to put her own hand to things, quite forgot now that she was a woman of position and fortune whom it ill-beseemed to do her own household work; she was here, there, and everywhere, and had an eye on all--excepting indeed her own daughter; but she was the petted darling of the house, brought up to Greek refinement, whose help in such arduous labors was not to be thought of; indeed, she would only have been in the way.  When the bishop had taken his leave Katharina was merely desired to be ready in her best attire, with a nosegay in her hand, to receive the Patriarch under the awning spread outside the entrance.  More than this the widow did not require of her, and as the girl flew up the stairs to her room she was thinking: \"Orion will be coming directly: it still wants fully two hours of noon, and if he stays there half an hour that will be more than enough.  I shall have time then to change my dress, but I will put my new sandals on at once as a precaution; nurse and the maid must wait for me in my room.  They must have everything ready for my return-- perhaps he and Paula may have much to say to each other.  He will not get off without a lecture, unless she has already found an opportunity elsewhere of expressing her indignation.\"  A few minutes later she had sprung to the top of a mound of earth covered with turf, which she had some time since ordered to be thrown up close behind the hedge through which she had yesterday made her way.  Her little feet were shod with handsome gold sandals set with sapphires, and she seated herself on a low bench with a satisfied smile, as though to assist at a theatrical performance.  Some broad-leaved shrubs, placed behind this place of ambush, screened her to some extent from the heat of the sun, and as she sat watching and listening in this lurking place, which she was not using for the first time, her heart began to beat more quickly; indeed, in her excitement she quite forgot some sweetmeats which she had brought to wile away the time and had poured into a large leaf in her lap.  Happily she had not long to wait; Orion arrived in his mother's four- wheeled covered chariot.  By the side of the driver sat a servant, and a slave was perched on the step to the door on each side of the vehicle. It was followed by a few idlers, men and women, and a crowd of half-naked children.  But they got nothing by their curiosity, for the carruca did not draw up in the road, but was driven into Rufinus' garden, and the trees and shrubs hid it from the gaze of the expectant mob, which presently dispersed.  Orion got out at the principal door of the house, followed by the treasurer; and while the old man welcomed the son of the Mukaukas, Nilus superintended the transfer of a considerable number of heavy sacks to their host's private room.  Nothing of all this had seemed noteworthy to Katharina but the quantity and size of the bags--full, no doubt, of gold--and the man, whom alone she cared to see.  Never had she thought Orion so handsome; the long, flowing mourning robe, which he"]]]
