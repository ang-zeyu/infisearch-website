The Alexandrians provided for that.  \"He had recognized the flute-player's will, nay, had granted more to the royal house than could have been given to the former.  Cleopatra and her brother-husband, Dionysus, were to share the government, and he also bestowed on Arsinoe and her youngest brother the island of Cyprus, which had been wrested from their uncle Ptolemy by the republic.  Rome was, of course, to remain the guardian of the brothers and sisters.  \"This arrangement was unendurable to Pothinus and the former rulers of the state.  Cleopatra as Queen, and Rome--that is Caesar, the dictator, her friend, as guardian--meant their removal from power, their destruction, and they resisted violently.  \"The Egyptians and even the Alexandrians supported them.  The young King hated nothing more than the yoke of the unloved sister, who was so greatly his superior.  Caesar had come with a force by no means equal to theirs, and it might be possible to draw the mighty general into a snare. They fought with all the power at their command, with such passionate eagerness, that the dictator had never been nearer succumbing to peril. But Cleopatra certainly did not paralyze his strength and cautious deliberation.  No!  He had never been greater; never proved the power of his genius so magnificently.  And against what superior power, what hatred he contended!  I myself saw the young King, when he heard that Cleopatra had succeeded in entering the palace and meeting Caesar, rush into the street, fairly crazed by rage, tear the diadem from his head, hurl it on the pavement, and shriek to the passers-by that he was betrayed, until Caesar's soldiers forced him back into the palace, and dispersed the mob.  \"Arsinoe had received more than she could venture to expect; but she was again most deeply angered.  After Caesar's entry into the palace, she had received him as Queen, and hoped everything from his favour.  Then her hated sister had come and, as so often happened, she was forgotten for Cleopatra's sake.  \"This  was  too much,  and with  the  eunuch Ganymedes, her confidant, and--as I have already said--an able warrior, she left the palace and joined the dictator's foes.  \"There were severe battles on land and sea; in the streets of the city, for the drinkable water excavated by the foe; and against the conflagration which destroyed part of the Bruchium and the library of the museum.  Yet, half dead with thirst, barely escaped from drowning, threatened on all sides by fierce hatred, he stood firm, and remained victor also in the open field, after the young King had placed himself at the head of the Egyptians and collected an army.  \"You know that the boy was drowned in the flight.  \"In battle and mortal peril, amid blood and the clank of arms, Caesar and Cleopatra spent half a year ere they were permitted to pluck the fruit of their common labour.  The dictator now made her Queen of Egypt, and gave her, as co-regent, her youngest brother, a boy not half her own age.  To Arsinoe he granted the life she had forfeited, but sent her to Italy.  \"Peace followed the victory.  Now, it is true, grave duties must have summoned the statesman back to Rome, but he tarried three full months longer.  \"Whoever knows the life of the ambitious Julius, and is aware what this delay might have cost him, may well strike his brow with his hand, and ask, 'Is it true and possible that he used this precious time to take a trip with the woman he loved up the Nile, to the island of Isis, which is so dear to the Queen, to the extreme southern frontier of the country?' Yet it was so, and I myself went in the second ship, and not only saw them together, but more than once shared their banquets and their conversation.  It was giving and taking, forcing down and elevating, a succession of discords, not unpleasant to hear, because experience taught that they would finally terminate in the most beautiful harmony.  It was a festal day for all the senses.\"  \"I imagine the whole Nile journey,\" interrupted Barine, \"to be like the fairy voyage, when the purple silk sails of Cleopatra's galley bore Antony along the Cydnus.\"  \"No, no,\" replied Archibius, \"she first learned from Antony the art of filling this earthly existence with fleeting pleasures.  Caesar demanded more.  Her intellect offered him the highest enjoyment.\"  Here he hesitated.  \"True, the skill with which, to please Antony, she daily offered him for years fresh charms for every sense, was not a matter of accident.\"  \"And this,\" cried Barine, \"this was undertaken by the woman who had recognized the chief good in peace of mind!\"  \"Ay,\" replied Archibius thoughtfully, \"yet this was the inevitable result.  Pleasure had been the young girl's object in life.  Ere passion awoke in her soul, peace of mind was the chief good she knew.  When the hour arrived that this proved unattainable, the firmly rooted yearning for happiness still remained the purpose of her existence.  My father would have been wiser to take her to the Stoa and impress it upon her that, if life must have a goal, it should be only to live in accordance with the sensibly arranged course of the world, and in harmony with one's own nature.  He should have taught her to derive happiness from virtue. He should have stamped goodness upon the soul of the future Queen as the fundamental law of her being.  He omitted to do this, because in his secluded life he had succeeded in finding the happiness which the master promises to his disciples.  From Athens to Cyrene, from Epicurus to Aristippus, is but a short step, and Cleopatra took it when she forgot that the master was far from recognizing the chief good in the enjoyment of individual pleasure.  The happiness of Epicurus was not inferior to that of Zeus, if he had only barley bread and water to appease his hunger and thirst.  \"Yet she still considered herself a follower of Epicurus, and later, when Antony had gone to the Parthian war, and she was a long time alone, she once more began to strive for freedom from pain and peace of mind, but the state, her children, the marriage of Antony--who had long been her lover--to Octavia, the yearning of her own heart, Anubis, magic, and the Egyptian teachings of the life after death, above all, the burning ambition, the unresting desire to be loved, where she herself loved, to be first among the foremost--\"  Here he was interrupted by the messenger, who informed him that the ship was ready.     CHAPTER VII.  Archibius had buried himself so deeply in the past that it was several minutes ere he could bring himself back to the present.  When he did so, he hastily discussed with the two ladies the date of their departure.  It was hard for Berenike to leave her injured brother, and Barine longed to see Dion once more before the journey.  Both were reluctant to quit Alexandria ere decisive news had arrived from the army and the fleet.  So they requested a few days' delay; but Archibius cut them short, requiring them, with a resolution which transformed the amiable friend into a stern master, to be ready for the journey the next day at sunset.  His Nile boat would await them at the Agathodaemon harbour on Lake Mareotis, and his travelling chariot would convey them thither, with as much luggage and as many female slaves as they desired to take with them.  Then softening his tone, he briefly reminded the ladies of the great annoyances to which a longer stay would expose them, excused his rigour on the plea of haste, pressed the hands of the mother and daughter, and retired without heeding Barine, who called after him, yet could desire nothing save to plead for a longer delay.  The carriage bore him swiftly to the great harbour.  The waxing moon was mirrored like a silver column, now wavering and tremulous, now rent by the waves tossing under a strong southeast wind, and illumined the warm autumn night.  The sea outside was evidently running high.  This was apparent by the motion of the vessels lying at anchor in the angle which the shore in front of the superb Temple of Poseidon formed with the Choma.  This was a tongue of land stretched like a finger into the sea, on whose point stood a little palace which Cleopatra, incited by a chance remark of Antony, had had built there to surprise him.  Another, of white marble, glimmered in the moonlight from the island of Antirrhodus; and farther still a blazing fire illumined the darkness. Its flames flared from the top of the famous lighthouse on the island of Pharos at the entrance of the harbour, and, swayed to and fro by the wind, steeped the horizon and the outer edge of the dark water in the harbour with moving masses of light which irradiated the gloomy distance, sometimes faintly, anon more brilliantly.  Spite of the late hour, the harbour was full of bustle, though the wind often blew the men's cloaks over their heads, and the women were obliged to gather their garments closely around them.  True, at this hour commerce had ceased; but many had gone to the port in search of news, or even to greet before others the first ship returning from the victorious fleet; for that Antony had defeated Octavianus in a great battle was deemed certain.  Guards were watching the harbour, and a band of Syrian horsemen had just passed from the barracks in the southern part of the Lochias to the Temple of Poseidon.  Here the galleys lay at anchor, not in the harbour of Eunostus, which was separated from the other by the broad, bridge-like dam of the Heptastadium, that united the city and the island of Pharos.  Near it were the royal palaces and the arsenal, and any tidings must first reach this spot.  The other harbour was devoted to commerce, but, in order to prevent the spread of false reports, newly arrived ships were forbidden to enter.  True, even at the great harbour, news could scarcely be expected, for a chain stretching from the end of the Pharos to a cliff directly opposite in the Alveus"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5475"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 03 (#3)"],["body","s, closed the narrow opening.  But it could be raised if a state galley arrived with an important message, and this was expected by the throng on the shore.  Doubtless many came from banquets, cookshops, taverns, or the nocturnal meeting-places of the sects that practised the magic arts, yet the weight of anxious expectation seemed to check the joyous activity, and wherever Archibius glanced he beheld eager, troubled faces.  The wind forced many to bow their heads, and, wherever they turned their eyes, flags and clouds of dust were fluttering in the air, increasing the confusion.  As the galley put off from the shore, and the flutes summoned the oarsmen to their toil, its owner felt so disheartened that he did not even venture to hope that he was going in quest of good tidings.  Long-vanished days had, as it were, been called from the grave, and many a scene from the past rose before him as he lay among the cushions on the poop, gazing at the sky, across which dark, swiftly sailing clouds sometimes veiled the stars and again revealed them.  \"How much we can conceal by words without being guilty of falsehood!\" he murmured, while recalling what he had told the women.  Ay, he had been Cleopatra's confidant in his early youth, but how he had loved her, how, even as a boy, he had been subject to her, body and soul! He had allowed her to see it, displayed, confessed it; and she had accepted it as her rightful due.  She had repelled with angry pride his only attempt to clasp her, in his overflowing affection, in his arms; but to show his love for her is a crime for which the loftiest woman pardons the humblest suitor, and a few hours later Cleopatra had met him with the old affectionate familiarity.  Again he recalled the torments which he had endured when compelled to witness how completely she yielded to the passion which drew her to Antony.  At that time the Roman had merely swept through her life like a swiftly passing meteor, but many things betrayed that she did not forget him; and while Archibius had seen without pain her love for the great Caesar bud and grow, the torturing feeling of jealousy again stirred in his heart, though youth was past, when at Tarsus, on the river Cydnus, she renewed the bond which still united her to Antony.  Now his hair had grown grey, and though nothing had clouded his friendship for the Queen, though he had always been ready to serve her, this foolish feeling had not been banished, and again and again mastered his whole being.  He by no means undervalued Antony's attractions; but he saw his foibles no less clearly.  All in all, whenever he thought of this pair, he felt like the lover of art who entrusts the finest gem in his collection to a rich man who knows not how to prize its real value, and puts it in the wrong place.  Yet he wished the Roman the most brilliant victory; for his defeat would have been Cleopatra's also, and would she endure the consequences of such a disaster?  The galley was approaching the flickering circle of light at the foot of the Pharos, and Archibius was just producing the token which was to secure the lifting of the chain, when his name echoed through the stillness of the night.  It was Dion hailing him from a boat tossing near the mouth of the harbour on the waves surging in from the turbulent sea.  He had recognized Archibius's swift galley from the bust of Epicurus which was illumined by the light of the lantern in the prow.  Cleopatra had had it placed upon the ship which, by her orders, had been built for her friend.  Dion now desired to join him, and was soon standing on the deck at his side.  He had landed on the island of Pharos, and entered a sailors' tavern to learn what was passing.  But no one could give him any definite information, for the wind was blowing from the land and allowed large vessels to approach the Egyptian coast only by the aid of oars.  Shortly before the breeze had veered from south to southeast, and an experienced Rhodian would \"never again lift cup of wine to his lips\" if it did not blow from the north to-morrow or the day after.  Then ships bearing news might reach Alexandria by the dozen--that is, the greybeard added with a defiant glance at the daintily clad city gentleman--if they were allowed to pass the Pharos or go through the Poseidon basin into the Eunostus. He had fancied that he saw sails on the horizon at sunset, but the swiftest galley became a hedgehog when the wind blew against its prow, and even checked the oars.  Others, too, had fancied that they had seen sails, and Dion would gladly have gone out to sea to investigate, but he was entirely alone in a frail hired boat, and this would not have been permitted to pass beyond the harbour.  The expectation that every road would be open to Archibius had not deceived him, and the harbour chain was drawn aside for the Epicurus. With swelling sails, urged by the strong wind blowing from the southeast, its keel cut the rolling waves.  Soon a faint, tremulous light appeared in the north.  It must be a ship; and though the helmsman in the tavern at Pharos, who looked as though he had not always steered peaceful trading-vessels, had spoken of some which did not let the ships they caught pass unscathed, the men on the well- equipped, stately Epicurus did not fear pirates, especially as morning was close at hand, and it had just shot by two clumsy men-of-war which had been sent out by the Regent.  The strong wind filled every sail, rowing would have been useless labour, and the light in front seemed to be coming nearer.  A wan glimmer was already beginning to brighten the distant east when the Epicurus approached the vessel with the light, but it seemed to wish to avoid the Alexandrian, and turned suddenly towards the northeast.  Archibius and Dion now discussed whether it would be worth while to pursue the fugitive.  It was a small ship, which, as the dark masses of clouds became bordered with golden edges, grew more distinct and appeared to be a Cilician pirate of the smallest size.  As to its crew, the tried sailors on the Epicurus, a much larger vessel, which lacked no means of defence, showed no signs of alarm, the helmsman especially, who had served in the fleet of Sextus Pompey, and had sprung upon the deck of many a pirate ship.  Archibius deemed it foolish to commence a conflict unnecessarily.  But Dion was in the mood to brave every peril.  If life and death were at stake, so much the better!  He had informed his friend of Iras's fears.  The fleet must be in a critical situation, and if the little Cilician had had nothing to conceal she would not have shunned the Epicurus.  It was worth while to learn what had induced her to turn back just before reaching the harbour.  The warlike helmsman also desired to give chase, and Archibius yielded, for the uncertainty was becoming more and more unbearable.  Dion's soul was deeply burdened too.  He could not banish Barine's image; and since Archibius had told him that he had found her resolved to shut her house against guests, and how willingly she had accepted his invitation to the country, again and again he pondered over the question what should prevent his marrying the quiet daughter of a distinguished artist, whom he loved?  Archibius had remarked that Barine would be glad to greet her most intimate friends--among whom he was included--in her quiet country.  Dion did not doubt this, but he was equally sure that the greeting would bind him to her and rub him of his liberty, perhaps forever.  But would the Alexandrian possess the lofty gift of freedom, if the Romans ruled his city as they governed Carthage or Corinth?  If Cleopatra were defeated, and Egypt became a Roman province, a share in the business of the council, which was still addressed as \"Macedonian men,\" and which was dear to Dion, could offer nothing but humiliation, and no longer afford satisfaction.  If a pirate's spear put an end to bondage under the Roman yoke and to this unworthy yearning and wavering, so much the better!  On this autumn morning, under this grey sky, from which sank a damp, light fog, with these hopes and fears in his heart, he beheld in both the present and future naught save shadows.  The Epicurus overtook and captured the fugitive.  The slight resistance the vessel might have offered was relinquished when Archibius's helmsman shouted that the Epicurus did not belong to the royal navy, and had come in search of news.  The Cilician took in his oars; Archibius and Dion entered the vessel and questioned the commander.  He was an old, weather-beaten seaman, who would give no information until after he had learned what his pursuers really desired.  At first he protested that he had witnessed on the Peloponnesian coast a great victory gained by the Egyptian galleys over those commanded by Octavianus; but the queries of the two friends involved him in contradictions, and he then pretended to know nothing, and to have spoken of a victory merely to please the Alexandrian gentlemen.  Dion, accompanied by a few men from the crew of the Epicurus, searched the ship, and found in the little cabin a man bound and gagged, guarded by one of the pirates.  It was a sailor from the Pontus, who spoke only his native language. Nothing intelligible could be obtained from him; but there were important suggestions in a letter, found in a chest in the cabin, among clothing, jewels, and other stolen articles.  The letter-Dion could scarcely believe his own eyes-was addressed to his friend, the architect Gorgias.  The pirate, being ignorant of writing, had not opened it, but Dion tore the wax from the cord without delay. Aristocrates, the Greek rhetorician, who had accompanied Antony to the war, had written from Taenarum, in the south of the Peloponnesus, requesting the architect, in the general's name, to set the little palace at the end of the Choma in order, and surround it on the land side with a high wall.  No door would be necessary.  Communication "]]]
