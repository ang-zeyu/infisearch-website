When the great Memphis packet bore down upon him, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of; and set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into trouble. In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife. Virginia would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this guise.  The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties from date to date. For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of resistance in Missouri. Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living on greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade (so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where the bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's orders. Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville. Footsore, but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.  On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad a plight as himself. They travelled together, until one day some rough farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders of a creek and arrested all three for Union spies. And they laughed when Mr. Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper captain of the State Dragoons.  His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good Southerners), likewise laughed when Mr. Colfax and the two others were brought before him. His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.  \"Colfax!\" cried the Governor. \"A Colfax of St. Louis in butternuts and rawhide boots?\"  \"Give me a razor,\" demanded Clarence, with indignation, \"a razor and a suit of clothes, and I will prove it.\" The Governor laughed once more.  \"A razor, young man! A suit of clothes You know not what you ask.\"  \"Are there any gentlemen from St. Louis here?\" George Catherwood was brought in,--or rather what had once been George. Now he was a big frontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into his trousers in place of a sword. He recognized his young captain of dragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the cabin. The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which the Governor's soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way south, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who were their images. This was Price's army, but Price had gone ahead into Kansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their aid and save the state.     \"Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have    seen this country rabble. How you would have laughed, and cried,    because we are just like them. In the combined army two thousand    have only bowie-knives or clubs. Some have long rifles of Daniel    Boone's time, not fired for thirty years. And the impedimenta are a    sight. Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and    even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and    feather beds. But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen    and Yankees just as we are. Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees    haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under    Colonel Rives. I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.    He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,    Jefferson. Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we    march into St. Louis.\"                    \"COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July.     \"We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by Coon Creek and killed--we    don't know how many. Tell Maude that George distinguished himself    in the fight. We cavalry did not get a chance.     \"We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers. We cheered    until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold    buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars. General McCulloch    has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform. But how to    clothe and feed and arm our men! We have only a few poor cattle,    and no money. But our men don't complain. We shall whip the    Yankees before we starve.\"  For many days Mrs. Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which her dear boy was forced to endure. He, who was used to linen sheets and eider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the best table in the state, was reduced to husks.  \"But, Aunt Lillian,\" cried Virginia, \"he is fighting for the South. If he were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud of him.\"  Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to Virginia. How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even the candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away! He was happy, though wretched because he could not see her. It was the life he had longed for. At last (and most pathetic!) he was proving his usefulness in this world. He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden.     \"Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would    come of our not being able to work? How I wish you could see us    felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,    and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.    Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage. I can see    you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us.\"  It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew. She had always detested it. Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began. Sad to relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the front, --those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which were made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the war, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers.  \"Why should not our soldiers have them, too?\" said Virginia to the Russell girls. They were never so happy as when sewing on them against the arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.  The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those families separated from their dear ones by a great army. Clarence might die, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were brought a prisoner to St. Louis. How Virginia envied Maude because the Union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother Tom, at least! How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and brothers were at the front, this privilege!  We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to be a spy was to be a patriot. Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon countries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable. Compare, with a prominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St. Bartholomew.  They are both massacres. Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a few people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille. Feelings in each instance never ran higher. Our own provost marshal was hissed in the street, and called \"Robespierre,\" and yet he did not fear the assassin's knife. Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in a Union city (their own city). No women were thrown into prison, it is true. Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street corner before the provost's guard. Once in a while a detachment of the Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a street and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear, only to encounter another detachment in the alley.  One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the Carvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to Virginia's room, the door of which she burst open.  \"Oh, Jinny!\" she cried, \"Puss Russell's house is surrounded by Yankees, and Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!\"  \"Prisoners! What for?\" said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her last year's bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red.  \"Because,\" said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation \"because they waved at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen. They were being marched past Mr. Russell's house under guard--Puss had a small--\"  \"Confederate flag,\" put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself.  \"And she waved it between the shutters,\" Eugenie continued. And some one told, the provost marshal. He has had the house surrounded, and the family have to stay there.\"  \"But if the food gives out?\"  \"Then,\" said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, \"then each one of the family is to have just a common army ration. They are to be treated as prisoners.\"  \"Oh, those Yankees are detestable!\" exclaimed Virginia. \"But they shall pay for it. As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall pay for it ten times over.\" She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with its red and white ribbons, before the glass. Then she ran to the closet and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings. \"Wait for me, Genie,\" she said, \"and we'll go down to Puss's house together. It may cheer her to see us.\"  \"But not in that dress,\" said Eugenie, aghast. \"They will arrest you.\" \"Oh, how I wish they would!\" cried Virginia. And her eyes flashed so that Eugenie was frightened. \"How I wish they would!\"  Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from beneath her black lashes. It was about five in the afternoon when they started out together under Virginia's white parasol, Eugenie's slimmer courage upheld by her friend's bearing. We must remember that Virginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our great-grandmothers"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5393"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 06 (#4)"],["body","when the British held New York. It was as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South. Elderly gentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile in admiration, --some sadly, as Mr. Brinsmade. Young gentlemen found an excuse to retrace their steps a block or two. But Virginia walked on air, and saw nothing. She was between fierce anger and exaltation. She did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard in front of Puss Russell's house (these men were only human, after all); she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the corner, who could not resist a murmur of delight. The citizen sergeant only smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white. Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.  \"I suppose its because Mr. Russell won't let her,\" said Virginia, disconsolately, \"Genie, let's go to headquarters, and show this Yankee General Fremont that we are not afraid of him.\"  Eugenie's breath was taken away by the very boldness of this proposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and hero-worship got the better of prudence.  The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came back from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one. It still stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and very wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall and broad, and a high basement. Two stately stone porches capped by elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side. The chimneys are generous and proportional. In short, the house is of that type built by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best stood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving. A spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall of dressed stones, capped by an iron fence. The whole expressed wealth, security, solidity, conservatism. Alas, that the coal deposits under the black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven the owners of these houses out of them! They are now blackened, almost buried in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with a sigh. The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and west-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.  On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came in sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them. Talk was rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance. He had just returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military were wedded. Foreign officers should come to America to teach our army dress and manners. A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's body-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street before the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd that feared to jest. They felt like it save when they caught the stern military eye of the Hungarian captain. Virginia gazed at the glittering uniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses, and scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of Southern patriots on the burning prairies. Just then a sharp command escaped in broken English from the Hungarian. The people in the yard of the mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the gate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter. As he put foot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again to be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner. For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air. Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff, who smiled and began to walk toward them. Little Eugenie's knees trembled. She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony.  \"Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all. Oh, I wish you hadn't been so bold!\"  \"Hush,\" said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with a look. She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the insolence of that smile. How dare he march undaunted to within six paces of those eyes? The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat? Not a step. \"Oh, I hope he will arrest me,\" she said passionately, to Eugenie. \"He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell.\"  But hush! he was speaking. \"You are my prisoners\"? No, those were not the words, surely. The lieutenant had taken off his cap. He bowed very low and said:  \"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments.\"  What was left for them, after that, save a retreat? But he was not precipitate. Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing which drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side. And there she stood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away. A crowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers in uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards. One civilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the gate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down the side street. Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel. More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head. Virginia drew back. Mr. Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise, startled her.  \"May I have the pleasure,\" said that gentleman, \"of accompanying you home?\"  Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed.  \"You must not come out of your way,\" she said. Then she added. \"I am sure you must go back to the store. It is only six o'clock.\"  Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave Eliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him. His was a nature which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for sweet girls; they cloyed. But a real lady was something to attain. He had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out some of the vernacular.  \"Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel,\" he answered, with a shade of meaning.  \"Then existence must be rather heavy for you,\" she said. She made no attempt to introduce him to Eugenie. \"If we should have any more victories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush,\" said the son of Massachusetts. \"Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of its stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton\"  Virginia turned quickly, \"Oh, how dare you?\" she cried. \"How dare you speak flippantly of such things?\" His suavity was far from overthrown.  \"Flippantly Miss Carvel?\" said he. \"I assure you that I want to see the South win.\" What he did not know was that words seldom convince women. But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time. \"Do you cal'late,\" said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish ruin to his country?\"  \"But you are a Yankee born,\" she exclaimed.  \"There be a few sane Yankees,\" replied Mr. Hopper, dryly. A remark which made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a smile.  But much against her will he walked home with her. She was indignant by the time she reached Locust Street. He had never dared do such a thing before, What had got into the man? Was it because he had become a manager, and governed the business during her father's frequent absences? No matter what Mr. Hopper's politics, he would always be to her a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.  At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides almost bumped into them. He paused looked back, and bowed as if uncertain of an acknowledgment. Virginia barely returned his bow. He had been very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was threadbare. When she looked again, he had covered half the block. Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr, Hopper? Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his enjoyment. It was part of the fruits of his reward. He wished in that short walk that he might meet Mr. Cluyme and Belle, and every man and woman and child in the city whom he knew. From time to time he glanced at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a bit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey. For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of enjoyment in the progress of the game. Many and many a night in the bare little back room at Miss Crane's, Eliphalet had gloated over the very event which was now come to pass. Not a step of the way but what he had lived through before.  The future is laid open to such men as he. Since he had first seen the black cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he rehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place a week before. A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for this first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the right to walk in her company. The words he had prepared--commonplace, to be sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal stream. The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after a reason for it all. She brightened when she saw her father at the doors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to Eliphalet coldly.  \"Why, bless us, Jinny,\" said the Colonel, \"you haven't been parading the town in that costume! You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow night. My land!\" laughed he, patting her under the chin, \"there's no doubt about your sentiments, anyhow.\"  \"I've been over to Puss Russell's house,\" said she, breathless. \"They've closed it up, you know--\" (He nodded.) \"And then we went--Euge"]]]
