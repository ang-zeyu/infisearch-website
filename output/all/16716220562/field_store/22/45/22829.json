A number of young fellows had surrounded a boy and had unmercifully beaten him--he himself knew not wherefore.  The little one had defended himself bravely, but was at last overcome by numbers.  \"Then suddenly,\" continued the soldier, \"the door of a house near the circus opened, and a young girl with long golden hair flew out, and drove the boys to flight, and released the victim, her brother, from his tormentors.  She looked like a lioness,\" cried the narrator, \"Sirona she is called, and of all the pretty girls of Arelas, she is beyond a doubt the prettiest.\"  This opinion was confirmed on all sides, and Phoebicius, who at that time had just been admitted to the grade of \"lion\" among the worshippers of Mithras, and liked very well to hear himself called \"the lion,\" exclaimed, \"I have long been seeking a lioness, and here it seems to me that I have found one.  Phoebicius and Sirona--the two names sound very finely together.\"  On the following day he asked Sirona of her father for his wife, and as he had to set out for Rome in a few days the wedding was promptly celebrated.  She had never before quitted Arelas, and knew not what she was giving up, when she took leave of her father's house perhaps for ever.  In Rome Phoebicius and his young wife met again; there many admired the beautiful woman, and made every effort to obtain her favor, but to him she was only a lightly won, and therefore a lightly valued, possession; nay, ere long no more than a burden, ornamental no doubt but troublesome to guard.  When presently his handsome wife attracted the notice of the legate, he endeavored to gain profit and advancement through her, but Sirona had rebuffed Quintillus with such insulting disrespect, that his superior officer became the centurion's enemy, and contrived to procure his removal to the oasis, which was tantamount to banishment.  From that time he had regarded her too as his enemy, and firmly believed that she designedly showed herself most friendly to those who seemed most obnoxious to him, and among these he reckoned Polykarp.  Once more the knocker sounded on the senator's door; it opened, and Petrus himself stood before the raging Gaul, a lamp in his hand.     CHAPTER XI.  The unfortunate Paulus sat on a stone bench in front of the senator's door, and shivered; for, as dawn approached, the night-air grew cooler, and he was accustomed to the warmth of the sheepskin, which he had now given to Hermas.  In his hand he held the key of the church, which he had promised the door-keeper to deliver to Petrus; but all was so still in the senator's house, that he shrank from rousing the sleepers.  \"What a strange night this has been!\"  he muttered to himself, as he drew his short and tattered tunic closer together.  \"Even if it were warmer, and if, instead of this threadbare rag, I had a sack of feathers to wrap myself in, still I should feel a cold shiver if the spirits of hell that wander about here were to meet me again.  Now I have actually seen one with my own eyes.  Demons in women's form rush up the mountain out of the oasis to tempt and torture us in our sleep.  What could it have been that the goblin in a white robe and with flowing hair held in its arms?  Very likely the stone with which the incubus loads our breast when he torments us.  The other one seemed to fly, but I did not see its wings.  That side-building must be where the Gaul lives with his ungodly wife, who has ensnared my poor Hermas.  I wonder whether she is really so beautiful! But what can a youth who has grown up among rocks and caves know of the charms of women.  He would, of course, think the first who looked kindly at him the most enchanting of her sex.  Besides she is fair, and therefore a rare bird among the sunburnt bipeds of the desert.  The centurion surely cannot have found the sheepskin or all would not be so still here; once since I have been here an ass has brayed, once a camel has groaned, and now already the first cock is crowing; but not a sound have I heard from human lips, not even a snore from the stout senator or his buxom wife Dorothea, and it would be strange indeed if they did not both snore.\"  He rose, went up to the window of Phoebicius dwelling, and listened at the half open shutters, but all was still.  An hour ago Miriam had been listening under Sirona's room; after betraying her to Phoebicius she had followed him at a distance, and had slipped back into the court-yard through the stables; she felt that she must learn what was happening within, and what fate had befallen Hermas and Sirona at the hands of the infuriated Gaul.  She was prepared for anything, and the thought that the centurion might have killed them both with the sword filled her with bitter-sweet satisfaction.  Then, seeing the light through the crack between the partly open wooden shutters, she softly pushed them farther apart, and, resting her bare feet against the wall, she raised herself to look in.  She saw Sirona sitting up upon her couch, and opposite to her the Gaul with pale distorted features; at his feet lay the sheepskin; in his right hand he held the lamp, and its light fell on the paved floor in front of the bed, and was reflected in a large dark red pool.  \"That is blood,\" thought she, and she shuddered and closed her eyes.  When she reopened them she saw Sirona's face with crimson cheeks, turned towards her husband; she was unhurt--but Hermas?  \"'That is his blood!\"  she thought with anguish, and a voice seemed to scream in her very heart, \"I, his murderess, have shed it.\"  Her hands lost their hold of the shutters, her feet touched the pavement of the yard, and, driven by her bitter anguish of soul, she fled out by the way she had come--out into the open and up to the mountain.  She felt that rather would she defy the prowling panthers, the night-chill, hunger and thirst, than appear again before Dame Dorothea, the senator, and Marthana, with this guilt on her soul; and the flying Miriam was one of the goblin forms that had terrified Paulus.  The patient anchorite sat down again on the stone seat.  \"The frost is really cruel,\" thought he, \"and a very good thing is such a woolly sheepskin; but the Saviour endured far other sufferings than these, and for what did I quit the world but to imitate Him, and to endure to the end here that I may win the joys of the other world.  There, where angels soar, man will need no wretched ram's fell, and this time certainly selfishness has been far from me, for I really and truly suffer for another--I am freezing for Hermas, and to spare the old man pain.  I would it were even colder!  Nay, I will never, absolutely never again lay a sheepskin over my shoulders.\"  Paulus nodded his head as if to signify assent to his own resolve; but presently he looked graver, for again it seemed to him that he was walking in a wrong path.  \"Aye!  Man achieves a handful of good, and forthwith his heart swells with a camel-load of pride.  What though my teeth are chattering, I am none the less a most miserable creature.  How it tickled my vanity, in spite of all my meditations and scruples, when they came from Raithu and offered me the office of elder; I felt more triumphant the first time I won with the quadriga, but I was scarcely more puffed up with pride then, than I was yesterday.  How many who think to follow the Lord strive only to be exalted as He is; they keep well out of the way of His abasement. Thou, O Thou Most High, art my witness that I earnestly seek it, but so soon as the thorns tear my flesh the drops of blood turn to roses, and if I put them aside, others come and still fling garlands in my way.  I verily believe that it is as hard here on earth to find pain without pleasure, as pleasure without pain.\"  While thus he meditated his teeth chattered with cold, but suddenly his reflections were interrupted, for the dogs set up a loud barking. Phoebicius was knocking at the senator's door.  Paulus rose at once, and approached the gate-way.  He could hear every word that was spoken in the court-yard; the deep voice was the senator's, the high sharp tones must be the centurion's.  Phoebicius was demanding his wife back from Petrus, as she had hidden in his house, while Petrus positively declared that Sirona had not crossed his threshold since the morning of the previous day.  In spite of the vehement and indignant tones in which his lodger spoke, the senator remained perfectly calm, and presently went away to ask his wife whether she by chance, while he was asleep, had opened the house to the missing woman.  Paulus heard the soldier's steps as he paced up and down the court-yard, but they soon ceased, for Dame Dorothea appeared at the door with her husband, and on her part emphatically declared that she knew nothing of Sirona.  \"Your son Polykarp then,\" interrupted Phoebicius, \"will be better informed of her whereabouts.\"  \"My son has been since yesterday at Raithu on business,\" said Petrus resolutely but evasively; \"we expect him home to-day only.\"  \"It would seem that he has been quick, and has returned much sooner,\" retorted Phoebicius.  \"Our preparations for sacrificing on the mountain were no secret, and the absence of the master of the house is the opportunity for thieves to break in--above all, for lovers who throw roses into their ladies' windows.  You Christians boast that you regard the marriage tie as sacred, but it seems to me that you apply the rule only to your fellow-believers.  Your sons may make free to take their pleasure among the wives of the heathen; it only remains to be proved whether the heathen husbands will be trifled with or not.  So far as I am concerned, I am inclined for anything rather than jesting.  I would have you to understand that I will never let Caesar's uniform, which I wear, be stained by disgrace,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5496"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 03 (#3)"],["body"," and that I am minded to search your house, and if I find my undutiful wife and your son within its walls, I will carry them and you before the judge, and sue for my rights.\"  \"You will seek in vain,\" replied Petrus, commanding himself with difficulty.  \"My word is yea or nay, and I repeat once more no, we harbor neither her nor him.  As for Dorothea and myself--neither of us is inclined to interfere in your concerns, but neither will we permit another--be he whom he may--to interfere in ours.  This threshold shall never be crossed by any but those to whom I grant permission, or by the emperor's judge, to whom I must yield.  You, I forbid to enter.  Sirona is not here, and you would do better to seek her elsewhere than to fritter away your time here.\"  \"I do not require your advice!\"  cried the centurion wrathfully.  \"And I,\" retorted Petrus, \"do not feel myself called upon to arrange your matrimonial difficulties.  Besides you can get back Sirona without our help, for it is always more difficult to keep a wife safe in the house, than to fetch her back when she has run away.\"  \"You shall learn whom you have to deal with!\"  threatened the centurion, and he threw a glance round at the slaves, who had collected in the court, and who had been joined by the senator's eldest son.  \"I shall call my people together at once, and if you have the seducer among you we will intercept his escape.\"  \"Only wait an hour,\" said Dorothea, now taking up the word, while she gently touched her husband's hand, for his self-control was almost exhausted, \"I and you will see Polykarp ride home on his father's horse. Is it only from the roses that my son threw into your wife's window, that you suppose him to be her seducer--she plays so kindly with all his brothers and sisters--or are there other reasons, which move you to insult and hurt us with so heavy an accusation?\"  Often when wrathful men threaten to meet with an explosion, like black thunder-clouds, a word from the mouth of a sensible woman gives them pause, and restrains them like a breath of soft wind.  Phoebicius had no mind to listen to any speech from Polykarp's mother, but her question suggested to him for the first time a rapid retrospect of all that had occurred, and he could not conceal from himself that his suspicions rested on weak grounds.  And at the same time he now said to himself, that if indeed Sirona had fled into the desert instead of to the senator's house he was wasting time, and letting the start, which she had already gained, increase in a fatal degree.  But few seconds were needed for these reflections, and as he was accustomed when need arose to control himself, he said:  \"We must see--some means must be found--\" and then without any greeting to his host, he slowly returned to his own house.  But he had not reached the door, when he heard hoofs on the road, and Petrus called after him, \"Grant us a few minutes longer, for here comes Polykarp, and he can justify himself to you in his own person.\"  The centurion paused, the senator signed to old Jethro to open the gate; a man was heard to spring from his saddle, but it was an Amalekite--and not Polykarp--who came into the court.  \"What news do you bring?\"  asked the senator, turning half to the messenger and half to the centurion.  \"My lord Polykarp, your son,\" replied the Amalekite--a dark brown man of ripe years with supple limbs, and a sharp tongue--\"sends his greetings to you and to the mistress, and would have you to know that before mid-day he will arrive at home with eight workmen, whom he has engaged in Raithu.  Dame Dorothea must be good enough to make ready for them all and to prepare a meal.\"  \"When did you part from my son?\"  inquired Petrus.  \"Two hours before sundown.\"  Petrus heaved a sigh of relief, for he had not till now been perfectly convinced of his son's innocence; but, far from triumphing or making Phoebicius feel the injustice he had done him, he said kindly--for he felt some sympathy with the Gaul in his misfortune:  \"I wish the messenger could also give some news of your wife's retreat; she found it hard to accommodate herself to the dull life here in the oasis, perhaps she has only disappeared in order to seek a town which may offer more variety to such a beautiful young creature than this quiet spot in the desert.\"  Phoebicius waved his hand with a negative movement, implying that he knew better, and said, \"I will show you what your nice night-bird left in my nest.  It may be that you can tell me to whom it belongs.\"  Just as he hastily stepped across the court-yard to his own dwelling Paulus entered by the now open gate; he greeted the senator and his family, and offered Petrus the key of the church.  The sun meanwhile had risen, and the Alexandrian blushed to show himself in Dame Dorothea's presence in his short and ragged under-garment, which was quite inefficient to cover the still athletic mould of his limbs. Petrus had heard nothing but good of Paulus, and yet he measured him now with no friendly eye, for all that wore the aspect of extravagance repelled his temperate and methodical nature.  Paulus was made conscious of what was passing in the senator's mind when, without vouchsafing a single word, he took the key from his hand.  It was not a matter of indifference to him, that this man should think ill of him, and he said, with some embarrassment:  \"We do not usually go among people without a sheepskin, but I have lost mine.\"  Hardly had he uttered the words, when Phoebicius came back with Hermas' sheepskin in his hand, and cried out to Petrus:  \"This I found on my return home, in our sleeping-room.\"  \"And when have you ever seen Polykarp in such a mantle?\"  asked Dorothea.  \"When the gods visit the daughters of men,\" replied the centurion, \"they have always made choice of strange disguises.  Why should not a perfumed Alexandrian gentleman transform himself for once into one of those rough fools on the mountain?  However, even old Homer sometimes nodded--and I confess that I was in error with regard to your son.  I meant no offence, senator!  You have lived here longer than I; who can have made me a present of this skin, which still seems to be pretty new--horns and all.\"  Petrus examined and felt the skin, \"This is an anchorite's garment,\" he said; \"the penitents on the mountain are all accustomed to wear such.\"  \"It is one of those rascals then that has found his way into my house!\" exclaimed the centurion.  \"I bear Caesar's commission, and I am to exterminate ill vagabonds that trouble the dwellers in the oasis, or travellers in the desert.  Thus run the orders which I brought with me from Rome.  I will drive the low fellows together like deer for hunting, for they are all rogues and villains, and I shall know how to torture them until I find the right one.\"  \"The emperor will ill-requite you for that,\" replied Petrus.  \"They are pious Christians, and you know that Constantine himself--\"  \"Constantine!\"  exclaimed the centurion scornfully.  \"Perhaps he will let himself be baptized, for water can hurt no one, and he cannot, like the great Diocletian, exterminate the masses who run after the crucified miracle-monger, without depopulating the country.  Look at these coins; here is the image of Caesar, and what is this on the other side?  Is this your Nazarene, or is it the old god, the immortal and invincible sun? And is that man one of your creed, who in Constantinople adores Tyche and the Dioscuri Castor and Pollux?  The water he is baptized with to-day he will wipe away to-morrow, and the old gods will be his defenders, if in more peaceful times he maintains them against your superstitions.\"  \"But it will be a good while till then,\" said Perrus coolly.  \"For the present, at least, Constantine is the protector of the Christians.  I advise you to put your affair into the hands of Bishop Agapitus.\"  \"That he may serve me up a dish of your doctrine, which is bad even for women,\" said the centurion laughing; \"and that I may kiss my enemies' feet?  They are a vile rabble up there, I repeat it, and they shall be treated as such till I have found my man.  I shall begin the hunt this very day.\"  \"And this very day you may end it, for the sheepskin is mine.\"  It was Paulus who spoke these words in a loud and decided tone; all eyes were at once turned on him and on the centurion.  Petrus and the slaves had frequently seen the anchorite, but never without a sheepskin similar to that which Phoebicius held in his hand. The anchorite's self-accusation must have appeared incredible, and indeed scarcely possible, to all who knew Paulus and Sirona; and nevertheless no one, not even the senator, doubted it for an instant.  Dame Dorothea only shook her head incredulously, and though she could find no explanation for the occurrence, she still could not but say to herself, that this man did not look like a lover, and that Sirona would hardly have forgotten her duty for his sake.  She could not indeed bring herself to believe in Sirona's guilt at all, for she was heartily well disposed towards her; besides--though it, no doubt, was not right--her motherly vanity inclined her to believe that if the handsome young woman had indeed sinned, she would have preferred her fine tall Polykarp--whose roses and flaming glances she blamed in all sincerity--to this shaggy, wild-looking graybeard.  Quite otherwise thought the centurion.  He was quite ready to believe in the anchorite's confession, for the more unworthy the man for whom Sirona had broken faith, the greater seemed her guilt, and the more unpardonable her levity; and to his man's vanity it seemed to him easier--particularly in the presence of such witnesses as Petrus and Dorothea--to bear the fact that his wife should have sought variety and pleasure at any cost, even at that of devoting herself to a ragged beggar, than that she should have given her affections to a younger, handsomer, and worthier man than himself.  He had sinned much"]]]
