First I sent her a lovely nosegay of fresh pomegranate-blossoms, and with it a few verses I hammered out in the course of the night; then a basket of peaches which she likes very much, and now the doves.  And there lie her answers--the dear, sweet creature!  For my nosegay I got this red riband, for the fruit this peach with a piece bitten out.  Now I am anxious to see what I shall get for my doves.  I bought that little brown scamp in the market, and I shall take him with me to Corinth as a remembrance of Memphis, if he brings me back something pretty this time.  There, I hear the door, that is he; come here youngster, what have you brought?\"  Publius stood with his arms crossed behind his back, hearing and watching the excited speech and gestures of his friend who seemed to him, to-day more than ever, one of those careless darlings of the gods, whose audacious proceedings give us pleasure because they match with their appearance and manner, and we feel they can no more help their vagaries than a tree can help blossoming.  As soon as Lysias spied a small packet in the boy's hand he did not take it from him but snatched up the child, who was by no means remarkably small, by the leather belt that fastened up his loin-cloth, tossed him up as if he were a plaything, and set him down on the table by his side, exclaiming:  \"I will teach you to fly, my little hippopotamus!  Now, show me what you have got.\"  He hastily took the packet from the hand of the youngster, who looked quite disconcerted, weighed it in his hand and said, turning to Publius:  \"There is something tolerably heavy in this--what can it contain?\"  \"I am quite inexperienced in such matters,\" replied the Roman.  \"And I much experienced,\" answered Lysias.  \"It might be, wait-it might be the clasp of her girdle in here.  Feel, it is certainly something hard.\"  Publius carefully felt the packet that the Corinthian held out to him, with his fingers, and then said with a smile:  \"I can guess what you have there, and if I am right I shall be much pleased.  Irene, I believe, has returned you the gold bracelet on a little wooden tablet.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  answered Lysias.  \"The ornament was prettily wrought and of some value, and every girl is fond of ornaments.\"  \"Your Corinthian friends are, at any rate.  But look what the wrapper contains.\"  \"Do you open it,\" said the Corinthian.  Publius first untied a thread, then unfolded a small piece of white linen, and came at last to an object wrapped in a bit of flimsy, cheap papyrus.  When this last envelope was removed, the bracelet was in fact discovered, and under it lay a small wax tablet.  Lysias was by no means pleased with this discovery, and looked disconcerted and annoyed at the return of his gift; but he soon mastered his vexation, and said turning to his friend, who was not in the least maliciously triumphant, but who stood looking thoughtfully at the ground.  \"Here is something on the little tablet--the sauce no doubt to the peppered dish she has set before me.\"  \"Still, eat it,\" interrupted Publius.  \"It may do you good for the future.\"  Lysias took the tablet in his hand, and after considering it carefully on both sides he said:  \"It belongs to the sculptor, for there is his name.  And there--why she has actually spiced the sauce or, if you like it better the bitter dose, with verses.  They are written more clearly than beautifully, still they are of the learned sort.\"  \"Well?\"  asked the Roman with curiosity, as Lysias read the lines to himself; the Greek did not look up from the writing but sighed softly, and rubbing the side of his finely-cut nose with his finger he replied:  \"Very pretty, indeed, for any one to whom they are not directly addressed.  Would you like to hear the distich?\"  \"Read it to me, I beg of you.\"  \"Well then,\" said the Corinthian, and sighing again he read aloud;           'Sweet is the lot of the couple whom love has united;           But gold is a debt, and needs must at once be restored.'  \"There, that is the dose.  But doves are not human creatures, and I know at once what my answer shall be.  Give me the fibula, Publius, that clasps that cloak in which you look like one of your own messengers.  I will write my answer on the wax.\"  The Roman handed to Lysias the golden circlet armed with a strong pin, and while he stood holding his cloak together with his hands, as he was anxious to avoid recognition by the passers-by that frequented this street, the Corinthian wrote as follows:           \"When doves are courting the lover adorns himself only;           But when a youth loves, he fain would adorn his beloved.\"  \"Am I allowed to hear it?\"  asked Publius, and his friend at once read him the lines; then he gave the tablet to the boy, with the bracelet which he hastily wrapped up again, and desired him to take it back immediately to the fair Irene.  But the Roman detained the lad, and laying his hand on the Greek's shoulder, he asked him: \"And if the young girl accepts this gift, and after it many more besides--since you are rich enough to make her presents to her heart's content--what then, Lysias?\"  \"What then?\"  repeated the other with more indecision and embarrassment than was his wont.  \"Then I wait for Klea's return home and--Aye! you may laugh at me, but I have been thinking seriously of marrying this girl, and taking her with me to Corinth.  I am my father's only son, and for the last three years he has given me no peace.  He is bent on my mother's finding me a wife or on my choosing one for myself.  And if I took him the pitch-black sister of this swarthy lout I believe he would be glad. I never was more madly in love with any girl than with this little Irene, as true as I am your friend; but I know why you are looking at me with a frown like Zeus the Thunderer.  You know of what consequence our family is in Corinth, and when I think of that, then to be sure--\"  \"Then to be sure?\"  enquired the Roman in sharp, grave tone.  \"Then I reflect that a water-bearer--the daughter of an outlawed man, in our house--\"  \"And do you consider mine as being any less illustrious in Rome than your own is in Corinth?\" asked Publius sternly.  \"On the contrary, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica.  We are important by our wealth, you by your power and estates.\"  \"So it is--and yet I am about to conduct Irene's sister Klea as my lawful wife to my father's house.\"  \"You are going to do that!\" cried Lysias springing from his seat, and flinging himself on the Roman's breast, though at this moment a party of Egyptians were passing by in the deserted street.  \"Then all is well, then--oh!  what a weight is taken off my mind!--then Irene shall be my wife as sure as I live!  Oh Eros and Aphrodite and Father Zeus and Apollo!  how happy I am!  I feel as if the biggest of the Pyramids yonder had fallen off my heart.  Now, you rascal, run up and carry to the fair Irene, the betrothed of her faithful Lysias--mark what I say--carry her at once this tablet and bracelet.  But you will not say it right; I will write here above my distich: 'From the faithful Lysias to the fair Irene his future wife.'  There--and now I think she will not send the thing back again, good girl that she is!  Listen, rascal, if she keeps it you may swallow cakes to-day out on the Grand Square till you burst--and yet I have only just paid five gold pieces for you.  Will she keep the bracelet, Publius--yes or no?\"  \"She will keep it.\"  A few minutes later the boy came hurrying back, and pulling the Greek vehemently by his dress, he cried:  \"Come, come with me, into the house.\"  Lysias with a light and graceful leap sprang right over the little fellow's head, tore open the door, and spread out his arms as he caught sight of Irene, who, though trembling like a hunted gazelle, flew down the narrow ladder-like stairs to meet him, and fell on his breast laughing and crying and breathless.  In an instant their lips met, but after this first kiss she tore herself from his arms, rushed up the stairs again, and then, from the top step, shouted joyously:  \"I could not help seeing you this once! now farewell till Klea comes, then we meet again,\" and she vanished into an upper room.  Lysias turned to his friend like one intoxicated, he threw himself down on his bench, and said:  \"Now the heavens may fall, nothing can trouble me!  Ye immortal gods, how fair the world is!\"  \"Strange boy!\" exclaimed the Roman, interrupting his friend's rapture. \"You can not stay for ever in this dingy stall.\"  \"I will not stir from this spot till Klea comes.  The boy there shall fetch me victuals as an old sparrow feeds his young; and if necessary I will lie here for a week, like the little sardines they preserve in oil at Alexandria.\"  \"I hope you will have only a few hours to wait; but I must go, for I am planning a rare surprise for King Euergetes on his birthday, and must go to the palace.  The festival is already in full swing.  Only listen how they are shouting and calling down by the harbor; I fancy I can hear the name of Euergetes.\"  \"Present my compliments to the fat monster!  May we meet again soon-- brother-in-law!\"     CHAPTER XXV.  King Euergetes was pacing restlessly up and down the lofty room which his brother had furnished with particular magnificence to be his reception- room.  Hardly had the sun risen on the morning of his birthday when he had betaken himself to the temple of Ptah with a numerous suite--before his brother"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5465"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 5 (#7)"],["body","could set out--in order to sacrifice there, to win the good graces of the high-priest of the sanctuary, and to question of the oracle of Apis.  All had fallen out well, for the sacred bull had eaten out of his hand; and yet be would have been more glad--though it should have disdained the cake he offered it, if only Eulaeus had brought him the news that the plot against the Roman's life had been successful.  Gift after gift, addresses of congratulation from every district of the country, priestly decrees drawn up in his honor and engraved on tablets of hard stone, lay on every table or leaned against the walls of the vast ball which the guests had just quitted.  Only Hierax, the king's friend, remained with him, supporting himself, while he waited for some sign from his sovereign, on a high throne made of gold and ivory and richly decorated with gems, which had been sent to the king by the Jewish community of Alexandria.  The great commander knew his master well and knew too that it was not prudent to address him when he looked as he did now.  But Euergetes himself was aware of the need for speech, and he began, without pausing in his walk or looking at his dignified friend:  \"Even the Philobasilistes have proved corrupt; my soldiers in the citadel are more numerous and are better men too than those that have remained faithful to Philometor, and there ought to be nothing more for me to do but to stir up a brief clatter of swords on shields, to spring upon the throne, and to have myself proclaimed king; but I will never go into the field with the strongest division of the enemy in my rear.  My brother's head is on my sister's shoulders, and so long as I am not certain of her--\"  A chamberlain rushed into the room as the king spoke, and interrupted him by shouting out:  \"Queen Cleopatra.\"  A smile of triumph flashed across the features of the young giant; he flung himself with an air of indifference on to a purple divan, and desired that a magnificent lyre made of ivory, and presented to him by his sister, should be brought to him; on it was carved with wonderful skill and delicacy a representation of the first marriage, that of Cadmus with Harmonia, at which all the gods had attended as guests.  Euergetes grasped the chords with wonderful vigor and mastery, and began to play a wedding march, in which eager triumph alternated with tender whisperings of love and longing.  The chamberlain, whose duty it was to introduce the  queen to her brother's presence, wished to interrupt this performance of his sovereign's; but Cleopatra held him back, and stood listening at the door with her children till Euergetes had brought the air to a rapid conclusion with a petulant sweep of the strings, and a loud and ear- piercing discord; then he flung his lute on the couch and rose with well- feigned surprise, going forward to meet the queen as if, absorbed in playing, he had not heard her approach.  He greeted his sister affectionately, holding out both his hands to her, and spoke to the children--who were not afraid of him, for he knew how to play madcap games with them like a great frolicsome boy--welcoming them as tenderly as if he were their own father.  He could not weary of thanking Cleopatra for her thoughtful present--so appropriate to him, who like Cadmus longed to boast of having mastered Harmonia, and finally--she not having found a word to say--he took her by the hand to exhibit to her the presents sent him by her husband and from the provinces.  But Cleopatra seemed to take little pleasure in all these things, and said:  \"Yes, everything is admirable, just as it has always been every year for the last twenty years; but I did not come here to see but to listen.\"  Her brother was radiant with satisfaction; she on the contrary was pale and grave, and, could only now and then compel herself to a forced smile.  \"I fancied,\" said Euergetes, \"that your desire to wish me joy was the principal thing that had brought you here, and, indeed, my vanity requires me to believe it.  Philometor was with me quite early, and fulfilled that duty with touching affection.  When will he go into the banqueting-hall?\"  \"In half an hour; and till then tell me, I entreat you, what yesterday you--\"  \"The best events are those that are long in preparing,\" interrupted her brother.  \"May I ask you to let the children, with their attendants, retire for a few minutes into the inner rooms?\"  \"At once!\" cried Cleopatra eagerly, and she pushed her eldest boy, who clamorously insisted on remaining with his uncle, violently out of the door without giving his attendant time to quiet him or take him in her arms.  While she was endeavoring, with angry scolding and cross words, to hasten the children's departure, Eulaeus came into the room.  Euergetes, as soon as he saw him, set every limb with rigid resolve, and drew breath so deeply that his broad chest heaved high, and a strong respiration parted his lips as he went forward to meet the eunuch, slowly but with an enquiring look.  Eulaeus cast a significant glance at Hierax and Cleopatra, went quite close up to the king, whispered a few words into his ear, and answered his brief questions in a low voice.  \"It is well,\" said Euergetes at last, and with a decisive gesture of his hand he dismissed Eulaeus and his friend from the room.  Then he stood, as pale as death, his teeth set in his under-lip, and gazing blankly at the ground.  He had his will, Publius Cornelius Scipio lived no more; his ambition might reach without hindrance the utmost limits of his desires, and yet he could not rejoice; he could not escape from a deep horror of himself, and he struck his broad forehead with his clenched fists.  He was face to face with his first dastardly murder.  \"And what news does Eulaeus bring?\"  asked Cleopatra in anxious excitement, for she had never before seen her brother like this; but he did not hear these words, and it was not till she had repeated them with more insistence that he collected himself, stared at her from head to foot with a fixed, gloomy expression, and then, letting his hand fall on her shoulder so heavily that her knees bent under her and she gave a little cry, asked her in a low but meaning tone:  \"Are you strong enough to bear to hear great news?\"  \"Speak,\" she said in a low voice, and her eyes were fixed on his lips while she pressed her hand on her heart.  Her anxiety to hear fettered her to him, as with a tangible tie, and he, as if he must burst it by the force of his utterance, said with awful solemnity, in his deepest tones and emphasizing every syllable:  \"Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica is dead.\"  At these words Cleopatra's pale cheeks were suddenly dyed with a crimson glow, and clenching her little hands she struck them together, and exclaimed with flashing eyes:  \"I hoped so!\"  Euergetes withdrew a step from his sister, and said: \"You were right. It is not only among the race of gods that the most fearful of all are women!\"  \"What have you to say?\"  retorted Cleopatra.  \"And am I to believe that a toothache has kept the Roman away from the banquet yesterday, and again from coming to see me to-day?  Am I to repeat, after you, that he died of it?  Now, speak out, for it rejoices my heart to hear it; where and how did the insolent hypocrite meet his end?\"  \"A serpent stung him,\" replied Euergetes, turning from his sister.  \"It was in the desert, not far from the Apis-tombs.\"  \"He had an assignation in the Necropolis at midnight--it would seem to have begun more pleasantly than it ended?\"  Euergetes nodded assent to the question, and added gravely:  \"His fate overtook him--but I cannot see anything very pleasing in the matter.\"  \"No?\"  asked the queen.  \"And do you think that I do not know the asp that ended that life in its prime?  Do you think that I do not know, who set the poisoned serpent on the Roman?  You are the assassin, and Eulaeus and his accomplices have helped you!  Only yesterday I would have given my heart's blood for Publius, and would rather have carried you to the grave than him; but to-day, now that I know the game that the wretch has been playing with me, I would even have taken on myself the bloody deed which, as it is, stains your hands.  Not even a god should treat your sister with such contempt--should insult her as he has done--and go unpunished!  Another has already met the same fate, as you know-- Eustorgos, Hipparchon of Bithynia, who, while he seemed to be dying of love for me, was courting Kallistrata my lady in waiting; and the wild beasts and serpents exercised their dark arts on him too.  Eulaeus' intelligence has fallen on you, who are powerful, like a cold hand on your heart; in me, the weak woman, it rouses unspeakable delight.  I gave him the best of all a woman has to bestow, and he dared to trample it in the dust; and had I no right to require of him that he should pour out the best that he had, which was his life, in the same way as he had dared to serve mine, which is my love?  I have a right to rejoice at his death. Aye!  the heavy lids now close those bright eyes which could be falser than the stern lips that were so apt to praise truth.  The faithless heart is forever still which could scorn the love of a queen--and for what?  For whom?  Oh, ye pitiful gods!\"  With these words the queen sobbed aloud, hastily lifting her hands to cover her eyes, and ran to the door by which she had entered her brother's rooms.  But Euergetes stood in her way, and said sternly and positively:  \"You are to stay here till I return.  Collect yourself, for at the next event which this momentous day will bring forth it will be my turn to laugh while your blood shall run cold.\"  And with a few swift steps he left the hall.  Cleopatra buried her face in the soft cushions of the couch, and wept without ceasing, till she was presently startled by loud cries and the clatter of arms.  Her quick wit told her what was happening.  In frantic haste she flew to the door"]]]
