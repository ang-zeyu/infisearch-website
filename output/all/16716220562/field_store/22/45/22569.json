Þā mælti Ūtgarðaloki: 'svā fōr þessi leikr sem mik varði; kǫttrinn er hęldr mikill, en Þōrr er lāgr ok lītill hjā stōr- męnni þvī sem hēr er með oss.'  Þā mælti Þōrr: 'svā lītinn sem pēr kallið mik, þā gangi nū til einnhvęrr, ok fāisk við mik; nū em ek reiðr.'  Þā svarar Ūtgarðaloki, ok litask um ā bękkina, ok mælti: 'eigi sē ek þann mann hēr inni, er eigi mun lītil-ræði ī þykkja at fāsk við þik;' ok ęnn mælti hann: 'sjām fyrst, kalli mēr hingat kęrlinguna, fōstru mīna [*] Ęlli, ok fāisk Þōrr við hana, ef hann vill; fęlt hęfir hon þā męnn er mēr hafa litizk eigi ū-stęrkligri en Þōrr er.'  Þvī næst gekk ī hǫllina kęrling ein gǫmul.  Þā mælti Ūtgar- ðaloki, at hon skal taka fang við Āsaþōr.  Ekki er langt um. at gǫ̈ra: svā fōr fang þat at þvī harðara er Þōrr knūðisk at fanginu, þvī fastara stōð hon; þā tōk kęrling at leita til þragða, ok varð Þōrr þā lauss ā fōtum, ok vāru þær svip- tingar all-harðar, ok eigi lęngi āðr en Þōrr fell ā knē ǫðrum fœti.  Þā gekk til Ūtgarðaloki, bað þau hætta fanginu, ok sagði svā, at Þōrr mundi eigi þurfa at bjōða fleirum mǫnnum fang ī hans hǫll; var þā ok liðit ā nātt, vīsaði Ūtgarðaloki Þōr ok þeim fēlǫgum til sætis, ok dvęljask þar nātt-langt ī gōðum fagnaði.  En at morgni, þegar dagaði, stęndr Þōrr upp ok þeir fēlagar, klæða sik, ok eru būnir braut at ganga.  Þā kom þar Ūtgarðaloki, ok lēt sętja þeim borð; skorti þā eigi gōðan fagnað, mat ok drykk.  En er þeir hafa matazk, þā snūask þeir til fęrðar.  Ūtgarðaloki fylgir þeim ūt, gęngr með þeim braut ōr borginni; en at skilnaði þā mælti Ūtgar- ðaloki til Þōrs, ok spyrr hvęrnig honum þykkir fęrð sīn orðin, eða hvārt hann hęfir hitt rīkara mann nakkvarn en sik.  Þōrr svarar at eigi mun hann þat sęgja, at eigi hafi hann mikla ū-sœmð farit ī þeira við-skiptum; 'en þō veit [*] ek at þēr munuð kalla mik lītinn mann fyrir mēr, ok uni ek þvī illa.'  Þā mælti Ūtgarðaloki: 'nū skal sęgja þēr it sanna, er þū ert ūt kominn ōr borginni--ok ef ek lifi ok mega-k rāða, þā skaltu aldri optar ī hana koma; ok þat veit trūa mīn, at aldri hęfðir þū ī hana komit, ef ek hęfða vitat āðr at þū hęfðir svā mikinn krapt með þēr, ok þū hafðir svā nær haft oss mikilli ū-fœru.  En sjōn-hvęrfingar hęfi ek gǫ̈rt þēr, svā at fyrsta sinn, er ek fann þik ā skōginum, kom ek til fundar við yðr; ok þā er þū skyldir leysa nestbaggann, þā hafða-k bundit með gres-jārni, en þū fannt eigi hvar upp skyldi lūka.  En þvī næst laust þū mik með hamrinum þrjū hǫgg, ok var it fyrsta minst, ok var þō svā mikit, at mēr mundi ęndask til bana, ef ā hęfði komit; en þar er þū sātt hjā hǫll minni set-berg, ok þar sātt-u ofan ī þrjā dala fer- skeytta ok einn djūpastan, þat vāru hamarspor þin; setber- ginu brā ek fyrir hǫggin en eigi sātt þū þat.  Svā var ok of leikana, er þēr þreyttuð við hirðmęnn mīna.  Þā var þat it fyrsta, er Loki gǫ̈rði; hann var mjǫk soltinn, ok āt tītt; en sā er Logi hēt, þat var villi-eldr, ok bręndi hann eigi seinna slātrit en trogit.  En er Þjālfi þreytti rāsina við þann er Hugi hēt, þat var hugi minn, ok var Þjālfa eigi vænt at þreyta skjōt-fœri við hann.  En er þū drakkt af horninu, ok þōtti þēr seint līða,--en þat veit trūa mīn, at þā varð þat undr, er ek munda eigi trūa at vera mætti; annarr ęndir hornsins var ūt ī hafi, en þat sāttu eigi; en nū, er þū kömr til sævarins, þā mun-tu sjā mega, hvęrn þurð þū hęfir drukkit ā sænum.'  Þat eru nū fjǫrur kallaðar.  Ok ęnn mælti hann: 'eigi þōtti mēr hitt minna vera vert, er þū lyptir upp kęt- tinum, ok þēr satt at sęgja, þā hræddusk allir þeir er sā, er þū lyptir af jǫrðu einum fœtinum; en sā kǫttr var eigi sem þēr sȳndisk; þat var Miðgarðs-ormr, er liggr um lǫnd ǫll, ok vannsk honum varliga lęngðin til, at jǫrðina tœki sporðr ok hǫfuð; ok svā langt seildisk þū upp at skamt var þā til himins.  En hitt var ok mikit undr um fangit, er þū fekkzk við Ęlli; fyrir þvī at engi hęfir sā orðit, ok engi mun verða, ef svā gamall er at ęlli bīðr, at eigi komi ęllin ǫllum til falls.  Ok er nū þat sātt at sęgja, at vēr munum skiljask, ok mun þā bętr hvārratvęggju handar at þēr komið eigi optar mik at hitta; ek mun ęnn annat sinn vęrja borg mīna með þvīlīkum vēlum eða ǫðrum, svā at ekki vald munu þēr ā mēr fā.'  En er Þōrr heyrði þessa tǫlu, greip hann til hamarsins, ok bregðr ā lopt; en er hann skal fram reiða, þā sēr hann þar hvęrgi Ūtgarðaloka, ok þā snȳsk hann aptr til borgarinnar, ok ætlask þā fyrir at brjōta borgina; þā sēr hann þar vǫllu vīða ok fagra, en enga borg.  Snȳsk hann þā aptr, ok fęrr leið sina, til þess er hann kom aptr ī Þrūð- vanga.   III. BALDER  Annarr sonr Ōðins er Baldr, ok er frā honum gott at sęgja: hann er bęztr, ok hann lofa allir.  Hann er svā fagr ā-litum ok bjartr svā at lȳsir af honum; ok eitt gras er svā hvītt at jafnat er til Baldrs brār, þat er allra grasa hvītast; ok þar ęptir māttu marka hans fęgrð, bæði ā hār ok ā līki; hann er vitrastr āsanna, ok fęgrstr taliðr ok līknsamastr.  En sū nāttūra fylgir honum at engi mā haldask dōmr hans. [*] Hann bȳr þar sem heitir Breiða-blik, þat er ā himni; ī þeim stað mā ekki vera ū-hreint, svā sem hēr sęgir:      Breiðablik heita,     þar er Baldr hęfir         sēr of gǫ̈rva sali;     ī þvī landi      er ek liggja veit         fæsta feikn-stafi.   IV. THE DEATH OF BALDER  Þat er upphaf þessar sǫgu, at Baldr inn gōða dreymði drauma stōra ok hættliga um līf sitt.  En er hann sagði āsunum draumana, þā bāru þeir saman rāð sīn, ok var þat gǫ̈rt at beiða griða Baldri fyrir alls konar hāska; ok Frigg tōk svardaga til þess, at eira skyldu Baldri eldr ok vatn, jārn ok alls konar mālmr, steinar, jǫrðin, viðirnir, sōttirnar, dȳrin, fuglarnir, eitr, ormar.  En er þetta var gǫ̈rt ok vitat, þā var þat skęmtun Baldrs ok āsanna at hann skyldi standa upp ā þingum, en allir aðrir skyldu sumir skjōta ā hann, sumir hǫggva til, sumir bęrja grjōti.  En hvat sem at var gǫ̈rt, sakaði hann ekki, ok þōtti þetta ǫllum mikill frami.  En er [*] þetta sā Loki Laufeyjar-son, þā līkaði honum illa er Baldr sakaði ekki.  Hann gekk til Fęn-salar til Friggjar, ok brā sēr ī konu līki; þā spyrr Frigg ef sū kona vissi hvat æsir hǫfðusk at ā þinginu.  Hon sagði at allir skutu at Baldri, ok þat, at hann sakaði ekki.  Þā mælti Frigg: 'eigi munu vāpn eða viðir granda Baldri; eiða hęfi ek þęgit af ǫllum þeim.'  Þā spyrr konan: 'hafa allir hlutir eiða unnit at eira Baldri?'  Þā svarar Frigg: 'vęx viðar-teinungr einn fyrir vestan Val-hǫll; sā er Mistilteinn kallaðr; sā þōtti mēr ungr [*] at kręfja eiðsins.'  Þvī næst hvarf konan ā braut; en Loki tōk Mistiltein ok sleit upp, ok gekk til þings.  En Hǫðr stōð utarliga ī mannhringinum, þvī at hann var blindr.  Þā mælti Loki við hann: 'hvī skȳtr þū ekki at Baldri?'  Hann svarar: 'þvī at ek sē eigi, hvar Baldr er, ok þat annat, at ek em vapnlauss.'  Þā mælti Loki: 'gǫ̈r-ðu þō ī līking annarra, manna, ok veit Baldri sœmð sem aðrir męnn; ek mun vīsa þēr til, hvar hann stęndr; skjōt at honum vęndi þessum.' Hǫðr tōk Mistiltein, ok skaut at Baldri at tilvīsun Loka; flaug skotit ī gęgnum hann, ok fell hann dauðr til jarðar; ok hęfir þat mest ū-happ verit unnit með goðum ok mǫnnum. [*] Þā er Baldr var fallinn, þā fellusk ǫllum āsum orð-tǫk, ok svā hęndr at taka til hans; ok sā hvęrr til annars, ok vāru [*] allir með einum hug til þess er unnit hafði verkit; en engi mātti hęfna: þar var svā mikill griða-staðr.  En þā er æsirnir freistuðu at mæla, þā var hitt þō fyrr, at grātrinn [*] kom upp, svā at engi mātti ǫðrum sęgja með orðunum frā sīnum harmi.  En Ōðinn bar þeim mun vęrst þenna skaða, sem hann kunni mesta skyn, hvęrsu mikil af-taka ok missa āsunum var ī frā-falli Baldrs.  En er goðin vitkuðusk, þā mælti Frigg ok spurði, hvęrr sā væri með āsum, er eignask vildi allar āstir hennar ok hylli, ok vili hann rīða ā hęl-veg [*] ok freista ef hann fāi fundit Baldr, ok bjōða Hęlju ūt-lausn, ef hon vill lāta fara Baldr heim ī Ās-garð.  En sā er nęfndr Hęrmōðr inn hvati, sonr Ōðins, er til þeirar farar varð.  Þā var tękinn Sleipnir, hestr Ōðins, ok leiddr fram, ok steig Hęrmōðr ā þann hest, ok hleypði braut.  En æsirnir tōku līk Baldrs ok fluttu til sævar.  Hring- horni hēt skip Baldrs, hann var allra skipa mestr; hann vildu goðin fram sętja, ok gǫ̈ra þar ā bāl-fǫr Baldrs; en skipit gekk hvęrgi fram.  Þā var sęnt ī Jǫtunheima ęptir gȳgi þeiri er Hyrrokin hēt; en er hon kom, ok reið vargi, ok hafði hǫgg-orm at taumum, þā hljōp hon af hestinum, en Ōðinn kallaði til ber-sęrki fjōra at gæta hestsins, ok fengu þeir eigi haldit, nema þeir fęldi hann.  Þā gekk Hyrrokin ā [*] fram-stafn nǫkkvans, ok hratt fram ī fyrsta við-bragði, svā at eldr hraut ōr hlunnunum, ok lǫnd ǫll skulfu.  Þā varð Þōrr reiðr, ok greip hamarinn, ok mundi þā brjōta hǫfuð hęnnar, āðr en goðin ǫll bāðu hęnni friðar.  Þā var borit ūt ā skipit līk Baldrs; ok er þat sā kona hans, Nanna, Neps dōttir, þā sprakk hon af harmi, ok dō; var hon borin ā bālit, ok slęgit ī eldi.  Þā stōð Þōrr at, ok vīgði bālit með Mjǫllni; en fyrir fōtum hans rann dvergr nakkvarr, sā er Litr nęfndr; en Þōrr spyrndi fœti sīnum ā hann, ok hratt honum ī eldinn, ok brann hann.  En at þessi bręnnu sōtti margs konar þjōð: fyrst at sęgja frā Ōðni, at með honum fōr Frigg ok valkyrjur ok hrafnar hans; en Freyr ōk ī kęrru með gęlti þeim er Gullin-bursti heitir eða Slīðrug-tanni; en Heimdallr reið hesti þeim er Gull-toppr heitir; en Freyja kǫttum sīnum.  Þar kömr ok mikit fōlk hrīmþursa, ok berg- risar.  Ōðinn lagði ā bālit gullhring þann er Draupnir heitir; honum fylgði sīðan sū nāttūra, at hina nīundu hvęrja nātt drupu af honum ātta gullhringar jafn-hǫfgir.  Hestr Baldrs var leiddr ā bālit með ǫllu reiði.  En þat er at sęgja frā Hęrmōði, at hann reið nīu nætr dökkva dala ok djūpa, svā at hann sā ekki, fyrr en hann kom til ārinnar Gjallar, ok reið ā Gjallar-brūna; hon er þǫkð lȳsi-gulli.  Mōðguðr er nęfnd mær sū er gætir brūar- innar; hon spurði hann at nafni eða ætt, ok sagði at hinn fyrra dag riðu um brūna fimm fylki dauðra manna; 'en eigi dynr brūin minnr undir einum þēr, ok eigi"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54274"],["title","Shakespeare's Christmas, and other stories (#0)"],["body","SHAKESPEARE'S CHRISTMAS    AND OTHER STORIES  [Illustration: \"UNBAR THE DOOR!\" SHE COMMANDED.    _Frontispiece._       _See p. 286_]       SHAKESPEARE'S   CHRISTMAS    AND OTHER STORIES    BY   \"Q\"   (A.T.

I  At the theatre in Shoreditch, on Christmas Eve, 1598, the Lord Chamberlain's servants presented a new comedy. Never had the Burbages played to such a house. It cheered every speech--good, bad, or indifferent. To be sure, some of the _dramatis personæ_--Prince Hal and Falstaff, Bardolph and Mistress Quickly--were old friends; but this alone would not account for such a welcome. A cutpurse in the twopenny gallery who had been paid to lead the applause gave up toiling in the wake of it, and leaned back with a puzzled grin.  \"Bravo, master!\" said he to his left-hand neighbour a burly, red-faced countryman well past middle age, whose laughter kept the bench rocking. \"But have a care, lest they mistake you for the author!\"  \"The author? Ho-ho!\"----but here he broke off to leap to his feet and lead another round of applause. \"The author?\" he repeated, dropping back and glancing an eye sidelong from under his handkerchief while he mopped his brow. \"You shoot better than you know, my friend: the bolt grazes. But a miss, they say, is as good as a mile.\"  The cutpurse kept his furtive grin, but was evidently mystified. A while before it had been the countryman who showed signs of bewilderment. Until the drawing of the curtains he had fidgeted nervously, then, as now, mopping his forehead in despite of the raw December air. The first shouts of applause had seemed to astonish as well as delight him. When, for example, a player stepped forward and flung an arm impressively towards heaven while he recited--                            _When we mean to build,   We first survey the plot, then draw the model_--  and so paused with a smile, his voice drowned in thunder from every side of the house, our friend had rubbed his eyes and gazed around in amiable protest, as who should say, \"Come, come, ... but let us discriminate!\" By-and-by, however, as the indifferent applause grew warmer, he warmed with it. At the entrance of Falstaff he let out a bellowing laugh worthy of Olympian Jove, and from that moment led the house. The fops on the sixpenny stools began to mimic, the pit and lower gallery to crane necks for a sight of their fugleman; a few serious playgoers called to have him pitched out; but the mass of the audience backed him with shouts of encouragement. Some wag hailed him as \"Burbage's Landlord,\" and apparently there was meaning, if not merit, in the jest. Without understanding it he played up to it royally, leaning forward for each tally-ho! and afterwards waving his hat as a huntsman laying on his hounds.  The pace of the performance (it had begun at one o'clock) dragged sensibly with all this, and midway in Act IV., as the edge of a grey river-fog overlapped and settled gradually upon the well of the unroofed theatre, voices began to cough and call for lanterns. Two lackeys ran with a dozen. Some they hung from the balcony at the back, others they disposed along both sides of the stage, in front of the sixpenny stools, the audience all the while chaffing them by their Christian names and affectionately pelting them with nuts. Still the fog gathered, until the lantern-rays criss-crossed the stage in separate shafts, and among them the actors moved through Act V. in a luminous haze, their figures looming large, their voices muffled and incredibly remote.  An idle apprentice, seated on the right of the cutpurse, began for a game to stop and unstop his ears. This gave the cutpurse an opportunity to search his pockets. _Cantat vacuus_: the apprentice felt him at it and went on with his game. Whenever he stopped his ears the steaming breath of the players reminded him of the painted figures he had seen carried in my Lord Mayor's Show, with labels issuing from their mouths.  He had stopped his ears during the scene of King Henry's reconciliation with Chief Justice Gascoigne, and unstopped them eagerly again when his old friends reappeared--Falstaff and Bardolph and Pistol, all agog and hurrying, hot-foot, boot-and-saddle, to salute the rising sun of favour. \"Welcome these pleasant days!\" He stamped and clapped, following his neighbours' lead, and also because his feet and hands were cold.  Eh? What was the matter? Surely the fog had taken hold of the rogues! What was happening to Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet? Poor souls, they were but children: they had meant no harm. For certain this plaguy fog was infecting the play; and yet, for all the fog, the play was a play no longer, but of a sudden had become savagely real. Why was this man turning on his puppets and rending them? The worst was, they bled--not sawdust, but real blood.  The apprentice cracked a nut and peeled it meditatively, with a glance along the bench. The countryman still fugled; the cutpurse cackled, with lips drawn back like a wolf's, showing his yellow teeth.  \"Hist, thou silly knave!\" said the apprentice. \"Canst not see 'tis a tragedy?\"  The rascal peered at him for a moment, burst out laughing, and nudged the countryman.  \"Hi, master! Breeds your common at home any such goose as this, that cannot tell tickling from roasting?\"  The apprentice cracked another nut. \"Give it time,\" he answered. \"I said a tragedy. Yours, if you will, my friend; _his_ too, may be\"--with a long and curious stare at the countryman.   II      \"_My tongue is weary: when my legs are too, I will bid you     good-night: and so kneel down before you; but indeed to pray for     the Queen._\"  Play, epilogue, dance, all were over; the curtains drawn, the lanterns hidden behind them. The cutpurse had slipped away, and the countryman and apprentice found themselves side by side waiting while the gallery dissolved its crowd into the fog.  \"A brisk fellow,\" remarked the one, nodding at the vacant seat as he stowed away his handkerchief. \"But why should he guess me a rustic?\"  \"The fellow has no discernment,\" the apprentice answered dryly. \"He even took the play for a merry one.\"  The countryman peered forward into the young-old face silhouetted against the glow which, cast upward and over the curtain-rod across the stage, but faintly reached the gallery.  \"I love wit, Sir, wherever I meet it. For a pint of sack you shall prove me this play a sad one, and choose your tavern!\"  \"I thank you, but had liefer begin and discuss the epilogue: and the epilogue is 'Who's to pay?'\"  \"A gentleman of Warwickshire, Master What-d'ye-lack--will that content you? A gentleman of Warwickshire, with a coat-of-arms, or the College's promise--which, I take it, amounts to the same thing.\" The countryman puffed his cheeks.  \"So-so?\" The apprentice chuckled.                            \"_When we mean to build   We first survey the plot, then search our pockets._  How goes it? Either so, or to that effect.\"  \"The devil!\" The countryman, who had been fumbling in his breek pockets, drew forth two hands blankly, spreading empty fingers.  \"That was your neighbour, Sir: a brisk fellow, as you were clever enough to detect, albeit unserviceably late. I wish we had made acquaintance sooner: 'twould have given me liberty to warn you.\"  \"It had been a Christian's merest duty.\"  \"La, la, master! In London the sneaking of a purse is no such rarity that a poor 'prentice pays twopence to gape at it. I paid to see the play, Sir, and fought hard for my seat. Before my master gave over beating me, in fear of my inches and his wife (who has a liking for me), he taught me to husband my time. For your purse, the back of my head had eyes enough to tell me what befalls when a lean dog finds himself alongside a bone.\"  He seated himself on the bench, unstrapped a shoe, slipped two fingers beneath his stocking, and drew forth a silver piece. \"If a gentleman of Warwickshire will be beholden to a poor apprentice of Cheapside?\"  \"Put it up, boy; put it up! I need not your money, good lad: but I like the spirit of that offer, and to meet it will enlarge my promise. A pint of sack, did I say? You shall sup with me to-night, and of the best, or I am a Dutchman. We will go see the town together, the roaring, gallant town. I will make you free of great company: you shall hear the talk of gods! Lord, how "]]]
