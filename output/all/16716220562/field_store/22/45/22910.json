This consisted in each one in turn flinging her shoe over her head.  If it flew beyond a chalk-line to which she turned her back she was destined soon to marry the man she loved; if it fell between her and the mark she must yet have patience, or would be united to a companion she did not care for.  The girl who was drawing, and round whom at least twenty others were crowded, was a designer of patterns for weaving; she had too the gift which had characterized her heathen ancestors, of representing faces in profile, with a few simple lines, in such a way that, though often comically distorted, they were easily recognizable.  She was executing these works of art on a wax tablet with a copper stylus, and the others were to guess for whom they were meant.  One girl only sat by herself by the furthest post of the shed, and gazed silently into her lap.  Paula looked on and could understand everything that was going forward, though no coherent sentence was uttered and there was nothing to be heard but laughter--loud, hearty, irresistible mirth.  When a girl threw the shoe far enough the youthful crowd laughed with all their might, each one shouting the name of some one who was to marry her successful companion; if the shoe fell within the line they laughed even louder than before, and called out the names of all the oldest and dirtiest slaves.  A dusky Syrian had failed to hit the mark, but she boldly seized the chalk and drew a fresh line between herself and the shoe so that it lay beyond, at any rate; and their merriment reached a climax when a number of them rushed up to wipe out the new line, a saucy, crisp-haired Nubian tossed the shoe in the air and caught it again, while the rest could not cease for delight in such a good joke and cried every name they could think of as that of the lover for whom their companion had so boldly seized a spoke in Fortune's wheel.  Some spirit of mirth seemed to have taken up his quarters in the draughty shed; the group round the sketcher was not less noisy than the other.  If a likeness was recognized they were all triumphant, if not they cried the names of this or that one for whom it might be intended.  A storm of applause greeted a successful caricature of the severest of the overseers.  All who saw it held their sides for laughing, and great was the uproar when one of the girls snatched away the tablet and the rest fell upon her to scuffle for it.  Paula had watched all this at first with distant amazement, shaking her head.  How could they find so much pleasure in such folly, in such senseless amusements?  When she was but a little child even she, of course, could laugh at nothing, and these grown-up girls, in their ignorance and the narrow limitations of their minds, were they not one and all children still?  The walls of the governor's house enclosed their world, they never looked beyond the present moment--just like children; and so, like children, they could laugh.  \"Fate,\" thought she, \"at this moment indemnifies them for the misfortune of their birth and for a thousand days of misery, and presently they will go tired and happy to bed.  I could envy these poor creatures!  If it were permissible I would join them and be a child again.\"  The comic portrait of the overseer was by this time finished, and a short, stout wench burst into a fit of uproarious and unquenchable laughter before any of the rest.  It came so naturally, too, from the very depths of her plump little body that Paula, who had certainly not come hither to be gay, suddenly caught the infection and had to laugh whether she would or no.  Sorrow and anxiety were suddenly forgotten, thought and calculation were far from her; for some minutes she felt nothing but that she, too, was laughing heartily, irrepressibly, like the young healthful human creature that she was.  Ah, how good it was thus to forget herself for once!  She did not put this into words, but she felt it, and she laughed afresh when the girl who had been sitting apart joined the others, and exclaimed something which was unintelligible to Paula, but which gave a new impetus to their mirth.  The tall slight form of this maiden was now standing by the fire.  Paula had never seen her before and yet she was by far the handsomest of them all; but she did not look happy and perhaps was in some pain, for she had a handkerchief over her head which was tied at the top over the thick fair hair as though she had the toothache.  As she looked at her Paula recovered herself, and as soon as she began to think merriment was at an end.  The slave-girls were not of this mind; but their laughter was less innocent and frank than it had been; for it had found an object which they would have done better to pass by.  The girl with the handkerchief over her head was a slave too, but she had only lately come into the weaving-sheds after being employed for a long time at needle work under two old women, widows of slaves.  She had been brought as an infant from Persia to Alexandria with her mother, by the troops of Heraclius, after the conquest of Chosroes II.; and they had been bought together for the Mukaukas.  When her little one was but thirteen the mother died under the yoke to which she was not born; the child was a sweet little girl with a skin as white as the swan and thick golden hair, which now shone with strange splendor in the firelight. Orion had remarked her before his journey, and fascinated by the beauty of the Persian girl, had wished to have her for his own.  Servants and officials, in unscrupulous collusion, had managed to transport her to a country-house belonging to the Mukaukas on the other side of the Nile, and there Orion had been able to visit her undisturbed as often as fancy prompted him.  The slave-girl, scarcely yet sixteen, ignorant and unprotected, had not dared nor desired to resist her master's handsome son, and when Orion had set out for Constantinople--heedless and weary already of the girl who had nothing to give him but her beauty--Dame Neforis found out her connection with her son and ordered the head overseer to take care that the unhappy girl should not \"ply her seductive arts\" any more.  The man had carried out her instructions by condemning the fair Persian, according to an ancient custom, to have her ears cut off.  After this cruel punishment the mutilated beauty sank into a state of melancholy madness, and although the exorcists of the Church and other thaumaturgists had vainly endeavored to expel the demon of madness, she remained as before: a gentle, good-humored creature, quiet and diligent at her work, under the women who had charge of her, and now in the common work-shop.  It was only when she was idle that her craziness became evident, and of this the other girls took advantage for their own amusement.  They now led Mandane to the fire, and with farcical reverence requested her to be seated on her throne--an empty color cask, for she suffered under the strange permanent delusion that she was the wife of the Mukaukas George.  They laughingly did her homage, craved some favor or made enquiries as to her husband's health and the state of her affairs. Hitherto a decent instinct of reserve had kept these poor ignorant creatures from mentioning Orion's name in her presence, but now a woolly- headed negress, a lean, spiteful hussy, went up to her, and said with a horrible grimace:  \"Oh, mistress, and where is your little son Orion?\"  The crazy girl did not seem startled by the question; she replied very gravely: \"I have married him to the emperor's daughter at Constantinople.\"  \"Hey day!  A splendid match!\"  exclaimed the black girl.  \"Did you know that the young lord was here again?  He has brought home his grand wife to you no doubt, and we shall see purple and crowns in these parts!\"  These words brought a deep flush into the poor creature's face.  She anxiously pressed her hands on the bandage that covered her ears and said: \"Really Has he really come home?\"  \"Only quite lately,\" said another and more good-natured girl, to soothe her.  \"Do not believe her!\"  cried the negress.  \"And if you want to know the latest news of him: Last night he was out boating on the Nile with the tall Syrian.  My brother, the boatman, was among the rowers; and he went on finely with the lady I can tell you, finely. . . .\"  \"My husband, the great Mukaukas?\"  asked Mandane, trying to collect her ideas.  \"No.  Your son Orion, who married the emperor's daughter,\" laughed the negress.  The crazy girl stood up, looked about with a restless glance, and then, as though she had not fully understood what had been said to her, repeated: \"Orion?  Handsome Orion?\"  \"Aye, your sweet son, Orion!\"  they all shouted, as loud as though she were deaf.  Then the usually placable girl, holding her hand over her ear, with the other hit her tormentor such a smack on her thick lips that it resounded, while she shrieked out loud, in shrill tones:  \"My son, did you say?  My son Orion?--As if you did not know!  Why, he was my lover; yes, he himself said he was, and that was why they came and bound me and cut my ears.--But you know it.  But I do not love him--I could, I might wish, I. . . .\"  She clenched her fists, and gnashed her white teeth, and went on with panting breath:  \"Where is he?--You will not tell me?  Wait a bit--only wait.  Oh, I am sharp enough, I know you have him here.--Where is be?  Orion, Orion, where are you?\"  She sprang away, ran through the sheds and lifted the lids of all the color-vats, stooping low to look down into each as if she expected to find him there, while the others roared with laughter.  Most of her companions giggled at this witless behavior; but some, who felt it somewhat uncanny and whom the unhappy girl's bitter cry had struck painfully, drew apart and had already organized some new amusement, when a neat little woman appeared on the scene,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5518"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 02 (#3)"],["body","her plump hands and exclaiming:  \"Enough of laughter--now, to bed, you swarm of bees.  The night is over too soon in the morning, and the looms must be rattling again by sunrise. One this way and one that, just like mice when the cat appears.  Will you make haste, you night-birds?  Come, will you make haste?\"  The girls had learnt to obey, and they hurried past the matron to their sleeping-quarters.  Perpetua, a woman scarcely past fifty, whose face wore a pleasant expression of mingled shrewdness and kindness, stood pricking up her ears and listening; she heard from the water-shed a peculiar low, long-drawn Wheeuh!--a signal with which she was familiar as that by which the prefect Thomas had been wont to call together his scattered household from the garden of his villa on Mount Lebanon.  It was now Paula who gave the whistle to attract her nurse's attention.  Perpetua shook her head anxiously.  What could have brought her beloved child to see her at so late an hour?  Something serious must have occurred, and with characteristic presence of mind she called out, to show that she had heard Paula's signal: \"Now, make haste.  Will you be quick?  Wheeuh! girls--wheeuh!  Hurry, hurry!\"  She followed the last of the slave-girls into the sleeping-room, and when she had assured herself that they were all there but the crazy Persian she enquired where she was.  They had all seen her a few minutes ago in the shed; so she bid them good-night and left them, letting it be understood that she was about to seek the missing girl.     CHAPTER VII.  Paula went into her nurse's room, and Perpetua, after a short and vain search for the crazy girl, abandoned her to her fate, not without some small scruples of conscience.  A beautifully-polished copper lamp hung from the ceiling and the little room exactly suited its mistress both were neat and clean, trim and spruce, simple and yet nice.  Snowy transparent curtains enclosed the bed as a protection against the mosquitoes, a crucifix of delicate workmanship hung above the head of the couch, and the seats were covered with good cloth of various colors, fag-ends from the looms.  Pretty straw mats lay on the floor, and pots of plants, filling the little room with fragrance, stood on the window-sill and in a corner of the room where a clay statuette of the Good Shepherd looked down on a praying-desk.  The door had scarcely closed behind them when Perpetua exclaimed: \"But child, how you frightened me!  At so late an hour!\"  \"I felt I must come,\" said Paula.  I could contain myself no longer.\"  \"What, tears?\"  sighed the woman, and her own bright little eyes twinkled through moisture.  \"Poor soul, what has happened now?\"  She went up to the young girl to stroke her hair, but Paula rushed into her arms, clung passionately round her neck, and burst into loud and bitter weeping.  The little matron let her weep for a while; then she released herself, and wiped away her own tears and those of her tall darling, which had fallen on her smooth grey hair.  She took Paula's chin in a firm hand and turned her face towards her own, saying tenderly but decidedly: \"There, that is enough.  You might cry and welcome, for it eases the heart, but that it is so late.  Is it the old story: home- sickness, annoyances, and so forth, or is there anything new?\"  \"Alas, indeed!\"  replied the girl.  She pressed her handkerchief in her hands as she went on with excited vehemence: \"I am in the last extremity, I can bear it no longer, I cannot--I cannot!  I am no longer a child, and when in the evening you dread the night and in the morning dread the day which must be so wretched, so utterly unendurable. . . .\"  \"Then you listen to reason, my darling, and say to yourself that of two evils it is wise to choose the lesser.  You must hear me say once more what I have so often represented to you before now: If we renounce our city of refuge here and venture out into the wide world again, what shall we find that will be an improvement?\"  \"Perhaps nothing but a hovel by a well under a couple of palm-trees; that would satisfy me, if I only had you and could be free--free from every one else!\"  \"What is this; what does this mean?\"  muttered the elder woman shaking her head.  \"You were quite content only the day before yesterday. Something must have.  .  .  .\"  \"Yes, must have happened and has,\" interrupted the girl almost beside herself.  \"My uncle's son.--You were there when he arrived--and I thought, even I firmly believed that he was worthy of such a reception. --I--I--pity me, for I.  .  .  You do not know what influence that man exercises over hearts.--And I--I believed his eyes, his words, his songs and--yes, I must confess all--even his kisses on this hand!  But it was all false, all--a lie, a cruel sport with a weak, simple heart, or even worse--more insulting still!  In short, while he was doing all in his power to entrap me--even the slaves in the barge observed it--he was in the very act--I heard it from Dame Neforis, who is only too glad when she can hurt me--in the very act of suing for the hand of that little doll-- you know her--little Katharina.  She is his betrothed; and yet the shameless wretch dares to carry on his game with me; he has the face....\"  Again Paula sobbed aloud; but the older woman did not know how to help in the matter and could only mutter to herself:  \"Bad, bad--what, this too! --Merciful Heaven! .  .  .\"  But she presently recovered herself and said firmly: \"This is indeed a new and terrible misfortune; but we have known worse--much, much worse!  So hold up your head, and whatever liking you may have in your heart for the traitor, tear it out and trample on it. Your pride will help you; and if you have only just found out what my lord Orion is, you may thank God that things had gone no further between you!\"  Then she repeated to Paula all that she knew of Orion's misconduct to the frenzied Mandane, and as Paula gave strong utterance to her indignation, she went on:  \"Yes, child, he is a man to break hearts and ruin happiness, and perhaps it was my duty to warn you against him; but as he is not a bad man in other things--he saved the brother of Hathor the designer--you know her --from drowning, at the risk of his own life--and as I hoped you might be on friendly terms with him at least, on his return home, I refrained.... And besides, old fool that I am, I fancied your proud heart wore a breastplate of mail, and after all it is only a foolish girl's heart like any other, and now in its twenty-first year has given its love to a man for the first time.\"  But Paula interrupted her:  \"I love the traitor no more!  No, I hate him, hate him beyond words!  And the rest of them!  I loathe them all!\"  \"Alas! that it should be so!\" sighed the nurse.  \"Your lot is no doubt a hard one.  He--Orion--of course is out of the question; but I often ask myself whether you might not mend matters with the others.  If you had not made it too hard for them, child, they must have loved you; they could not have helped it; but ever since you have been in the house you have only felt miserable and wished that they would let you go your own way, and they--well they have done so; and now you find it ill to bear the lot you chose for yourself.  It is so indeed, child, you need not contradict me.  This once we will put the matter plainly: Who can hope to win love that gives none, but turns away morosely from his fellow- creatures?  If each of us could make his neighbors after his own pattern --then indeed!  But life requires us to take them just as we find them, and you, sweetheart, have never let this sink into your mind!\"  \"Well, I am what I am !\"  \"No doubt, and among the good you are the best--but which of them all can guess that?  Every one to some extent plays a part.  And you!  What wonder if they never see in you anything but that you are unhappy?  God knows it is ten thousand times a pity that you should be!  But who can take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face?\"  \"I have never uttered a single word of complaint of my troubles to any one of them!\"  cried Paula, drawing herself up proudly.  \"That  is  just the difficulty,\"  replied  Perpetua.  \"They took you in, and thought it gave them a claim on your person and also on your sorrows. Perhaps they longed to comfort you; for, believe me, child, there is a secret pleasure in doing so.  Any one who is able to show us sympathy feels that it does him more good than it does us.  I know life!  Has it never occurred to you that you are perhaps depriving your relations in the great house of a pleasure, perhaps even doing them an injury by locking up your heart from them?  Your grief is the best side of you, and of that you do indeed allow them to catch a glimpse; but where the pain is you carefully conceal.  Every good man longs to heal a wound when he sees it, but your whole demeanor cries out: 'Stay where you are, and leave me in peace.'--If only you were good to your uncle!\"  \"But I am, and I have felt prompted a hundred times to confide in him-- but then. . .\"  \"Well--then?\"  \"Only look at him, Betta; see how he lies as cold as marble, rigid and apathetic, half dead and half alive.  At first the words often rose to my lips.  .  .\"  \"And now?\"  \"Now all the worst is so long past; I feel I have forfeited the right to complain to him of all that weighs me down.\"  \"Hm,\" said Perpetua who had no answer ready.  \"But take heart, my child. Orion has at any rate learnt how far he may venture.  You can hold your head high enough and look cool enough.  Bear all that cannot be mended, and if an inward voice does not deceive me, he whom we seek. . .\"  \"That was what brought me here.  Are none of our messengers returned yet?\"  \"Yes, the little Nabathaean is come,\" replied her nurse with some hesitation, \"and he indeed--but for God's sake, child, form no vain hopes!  Hiram came to me soon after sun-down.  .  .\"  \"Betta!\"  screamed the girl, clinging to her nurse's arm.  \"What"]]]
