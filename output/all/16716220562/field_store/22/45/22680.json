The slave was pronounced guilty of two capital offences: first, of the murder of the sacred animals, and secondly, of a twelve-fold pollution of the Nile through dead bodies.  I was condemned as originator of this, (as they termed it) four-and-twenty-fold crime.       [According to the Egyptian law, the man who was cognizant of a crime      was held equally culpable with the perpetrator.]  \"Mus was executed on the same day.  May the earth rest lightly on him!  I shall never think of him again as my slave, but as a friend and benefactor!  My sentence of death was read aloud in the presence of his dead body, and I was already preparing for a long journey into the nether world, when the king sent and commanded a reprieve.       [This court of justice, which may be compared with the Areopagus at      Athens, and the Gerusia at Sparta, (Diod. I, 75.), was composed of      30 judges taken from the priestly caste, (10 from Heliopolis, 10      from Memphis, 10 from Thebes).  The most eminent from among their      number was chosen by them as president.  All complaints and defences      had to be presented in writing, that the judges might in no way be      influenced by word or gesture.  This tribunal was independent, even      of the king's authority.  Much information concerning the      administration of justice has been obtained from the Papyrus Abbott,      known by the name of the 'Papyrus judiciaire'.  Particulars and an      account of their literature may be found in Ebers \"Durch Gosen zum      Sinai,\" p.  534 and following.]  \"I was taken back to prison.  One of my guards, an Arcadian Taxiarch, told me that all the officers of the guard and many of the soldiers, (altogether four thousand men) had threatened to send in their resignation, unless I, their commander, were pardoned.  \"As it was beginning to grow dusk I was taken to the king.  \"He received me graciously, confirmed the Taxiarch's statement with his own mouth, and said how grieved he should be to lose a commander so generally beloved.  I must confess that I owe Amasis no grudge for his conduct to me, on the contrary I pity him.  You should have heard how he, the powerful king, complained that he could never act according to his own wishes, that even in his most private affairs he was crossed and compromised by the priests and their influence.       [See the parallel in the history of 2000 years later in the reigns      of Henry III. and IV. confronting the Jesuit influence, finally      culminating in assassination.  D.W.]  \"Had it only depended on himself, he could easily have pardoned the transgression of a law, which I, as a foreigner, could not be expected to understand, and might (though unjustly) esteem as a foolish superstition. But for the sake of the priests he dare not leave me unpunished.  The lightest penalty he could inflict must be banishment from Egypt.  \"He concluded his complaint with these words: 'You little know what concessions I must make to the priests in order to obtain your pardon. Why, our supreme court of justice is independent even of me, its king!'  \"And thus I received my dismissal, after having taken a solemn oath to leave Memphis that very day, and Egypt, at latest, in three weeks.  \"At the palace-gate I met Psamtik, the crown-prince.  He has long been my enemy, on account of some vexatious matters which I cannot divulge, (you know them, Rhodopis).  I was going to offer him my parting salutation, but he turned his back upon me, saying: Once more you have escaped punishment, Athenian; but you cannot elude my vengeance.  Whithersoever you may go, I shall be able to find you!'--'That remains to be proved,' I answered, and putting myself and my possessions on board a boat, came to Naukratis.  Here, by good fortune, I met my old friend Aristomachus of Sparta, who, as he was formerly in command of the Cyprian troops, will most likely be nominated my successor.  I should rejoice to know that such a first-rate man was going to take my place, if I did not at the same time fear that his eminent services will make my own poor efforts seem even more insignificant than they really were.\"  But here he was interrupted by Aristomachus, who called out: \"Praise enough, friend Phanes!  Spartan tongues are stiff; but if you should ever stand in need of my help, I will give you an answer in deeds, which shall strike the right nail on the head.\"  Rhodopis smiled her approval, and giving her hand to each, said: \"Unfortunately, the only conclusion to be drawn from your story, my poor Phanes, is that you cannot possibly remain any longer in this country. I will not blame you for your thoughtlessness, though you might have known that you were exposing yourself to great danger for a mere trifle. The really wise and brave man never undertakes a hazardous enterprise, unless the possible advantage and disadvantage that may accrue to him from it can be reckoned at least as equal.  Recklessness is quite as foolish, but not so blamable as cowardice, for though both do the man an injury, the latter alone can dishonor him.  \"Your thoughtlessness, this time, has very nearly cost your life, a life dear to many, and which you ought to save for a nobler end.  We cannot attempt to keep you here; we should thereby only injure ourselves without benefitting you.  This noble Spartan must now take your place as head and representative of the Greek nation at the Egyptian court, must endeavor to protect us against the encroachment of the priests, and to retain for us the royal favor.  I take your hand, Aristomachus, and will not let it go till you have promised that you will protect, to the utmost of your power, every Greek, however humble, (as Phanes did before you), from the insolence of the Egyptians, and will sooner resign your office than allow the smallest wrong done to a Hellene to go unpunished.  We are but a few thousands among millions of enemies, but through courage we are great, and unity must keep us strong.  Hitherto the Greeks in Egypt have lived like brothers; each has been ready to offer himself for the good of all, and all for each, and it is just this unity that has made us, and must keep us, powerful.  \"Oh!  could we but bestow this precious gift on our mother-country and her colonies! would the tribes of our native land but forget their Dorian, Ionian or AEolian descent, and, contenting themselves with the one name of Hellenes, live as the children of one family, as the sheep of one flock,--then indeed we should be strong against the whole world, and Hellas would be recognized by all nations as the Queen of the Earth!\"       [This longing desire for unity was by no means foreign to the      Greeks, though we seldom hear it expressed.  Aristotle, for example,      says VII.  7.:  \"Were the Hellenes united into one state, they could      command all the barbarous nations.\"]  A fire glowed in the eyes of the grey-haired woman as she uttered these words; and the Spartan, grasping her hand impetuously and stamping on the floor with his wooden leg, cried: \"By Zeus, I will not let a hair of their heads be hurt; but thou, Rhodopis, thou art worthy to have been born a Spartan woman.\"  \"Or an Athenian,\" cried Phanes.  \"An Ionian,\" said the Milesians, and the sculptor: \"A daughter of the Samian Geomori--\"  \"But I am more, far more, than all these,\" cried the enthusiastic woman. \"I am a Hellene!\"  The whole company, even to the Jew and the Syrian, were carried away by the intense feeling of the moment; the Sybarite alone remained unmoved, and, with his mouth so full as to render the words almost unintelligible, said:  \"You deserve to be a Sybarite too, Rhodopis, for your roast beef is the best I have tasted since I left Italy, and your Anthylla wine' relishes almost as well as Vesuvian or Chian!\"  Every one laughed, except the Spartan, who darted a look of indignation and contempt at the epicure.  In this moment a deep voice, hitherto unknown to us, shouted suddenly through the window, \"A glad greeting to you, my friends!\"  \"A glad greeting,\" echoed the chorus of revellers, questioning and guessing who this late arrival might prove to be.  They had not long to wait, for even before the Sybarite had had time carefully to test and swallow another mouthful of wine, the speaker, Kallias, the son of Phaenippus of Athens, was already standing by the side of Rhodopis.  He was a tall thin man of over sixty, with a head of that oval form which gives the impression of refinement and intellect. One of the richest among the Athenian exiles, he had twice bought the possessions of Pisistratus from the state, and twice been obliged to surrender them, on the tyrant's return to power.  Looking round with his clear keen eyes on this circle of acquaintances, he exchanged friendly greetings with all, and exclaimed:  \"If you do not set a high value on my appearance among you this evening, I shall think that gratitude has entirely disappeared from the earth.\"  \"We have been expecting you a long time,\" interrupted one of the Milesians.  \"You are the first man to bring us news of the Olympic games!\"  \"And we could wish no better bearer of such news than the victor of former days?\"  added Rhodopis.  \"Take your seat,\" cried Phanes impatiently, \"and come to the point with your news at once, friend Kallias.\"  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5451"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 02 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 1.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.   CHAPTER III.  The guests were all gone.  Their departing mirth and joy had been smitten down by the drunkard's abusive words, like fresh young corn beneath a hail storm.  Rhodopis was left standing alone in the empty, brightly decorated (supper-room).  Knakias extinguished the colored lamps on the walls, and a dull, mysterious half-light took the place of their brilliant rays, falling scantily and gloomily on the piled-up plates and dishes, the remnants of the meal, and the seats and cushions, pushed out of their places by the retiring guests.  A cold breeze came through the open door, for the dawn was at hand, and just before sunrise, the air is generally unpleasantly cool in Egypt.  A cold chill struck the limbs of the aged woman through her light garments.  She stood gazing tearlessly and fixedly into the desolate room, whose walls but a few minutes before had been echoing with joy and gladness, and it seemed to her that the deserted guest-chamber must be like her own heart.  She felt as if a worm were gnawing there, and the warm blood congealing into ice.  Lost in these thoughts, she remained standing till at last her old female slave appeared to light her to her sleeping apartment.  Silently Rhodopis allowed herself to be undressed, and then, as silently, lifted the curtain which separated a second sleeping apartment from her own.  In the middle of this second room stood a bedstead of maplewood, and there, on white sheets spread over a mattress of fine sheep's wool, and protected from the cold by bright blue coverlets's, lay a graceful, lovely girl asleep; this was Rhodopis' granddaughter, Sappho.  The rounded form and delicate figure seemed to denote one already in opening maidenhood, but the peaceful, blissful smile could only belong to a harmless, happy child.  One hand lay under her head, hidden among the thick dark brown hair, the other clasped unconsciously a little amulet of green stone, which hung round her neck.  Over her closed eyes the long lashes trembled almost imperceptibly, and a delicate pink flush came and went on the cheek of the slumberer.  The finely-cut nostrils rose and fell with her regular breathing, and she lay there, a picture of innocence, of peace, smiling in dreams, and of the slumber that the gods bestow on early youth, when care has not yet come.  Softly and carefully, crossing the thick carpets on tiptoe, the grey- haired woman approached, looked with unutterable tenderness into the smiling, childish face, and, kneeling down silently by the side of the bed, buried her face in its soft coverings, so that the girl's hand just came in contact with her hair.  Then she wept, and without intermission; as though she hoped with this flood of tears to wash away not only her recent humiliation, but with it all other sorrow from her mind.  At length she rose, breathed a light kiss on the sleeping girl's forehead, raised her hands in prayer towards heaven, and returned to her own room, gently and carefully as she had come.  At her own bedside she found the old slave-woman, still waiting for her.  \"What do you want so late, Melitta?\"  said Rhodopis, kindly, under her breath.  \"Go to bed; at your age it is not good to remain up late, and you know that I do not require you any longer.  Good night! and do not come to-morrow until I send for you.  I shall not be able to sleep much to-night, and shall be thankful if the morning brings me a short repose.\"  The woman hesitated; it seemed that she had some thing on her mind which she feared to utter.  \"There is something you want to ask me?\"  said Rhodopis.  Still the old slave hesitated.  \"Speak!\"  said Rhodopis, \"speak at once, and quickly.\"  \"I saw you weeping,\" said the slave-woman, \"you seem ill or sad; let me watch this night by your bedside.  Will you not tell me what ails you? You have often found that to tell a sorrow lightens the heart and lessens the pain.  Then tell me your grief to-day too; it will do you good, it will bring back peace to your mind.\"  \"No,\" answered the other, \"I cannot utter it.\"  And then she continued, smiling bitterly: \"I have once more experienced that no one, not even a god, has power to cancel the past of any human being, and that, in this world, misfortune and disgrace are one and the same.  Good night, leave me; Melitta!\"  At noon on the following day, the same boat, which, the evening before, had carried the Athenian and the Spartan, stopped once more before Rhodopis' garden.  The sun was shining so brightly, so warmly and genially in the dark blue Egyptian sky, the air was so pure and light, the beetles were humming so merrily, the boatmen singing so lustily and happily, the shores of the Nile bloomed in such gay, variegated beauty, and were so thickly peopled, the palm-trees, sycamores, bananas and acacias were so luxuriant in foliage and blossom, and over the whole landscape the rarest and most glorious gifts seemed to have been poured out with such divine munificence, that a passer-by must have pronounced it the very home of joy and gladness, a place from which sadness and sorrow had been forever banished.  How often we fancy, in passing a quiet village hidden among its orchards, that this at least must be the abode of peace, and unambitious contentment!  But alas! when we enter the cottages, what do we find? there, as everywhere else, distress and need, passion and unsatisfied longing, fear and remorse, pain and misery; and by the side of these, Ah! how few joys!  Who would have imagined on coming to Egypt, that this luxuriant, laughing sunny land, whose sky is always unclouded, could possibly produce and nourish men given to bitterness and severity? that within the charming, hospitable house of the fortunate Rhodopis, covered and surrounded, as it was, with sweet flowers, a heart could have been beating in the deepest sadness?  And, still more, who among all the guests of that honored, admired Thracian woman, would have believed that this sad heart belonged to her? to the gracious, smiling matron, Rhodopis herself?  She was sitting with Phanes in a shady arbor near the cooling spray of a fountain.  One could see that she had been weeping again, but her face was beautiful and kind as ever.  The Athenian was holding her hand and trying to comfort her.  Rhodopis listened patiently, and smiled the while; at times her smile was bitter, at others it gave assent to his words.  At last however she interrupted her well-intentioned friend, by saying:  \"Phanes, I thank you.  Sooner or later this last disgrace must be forgotten too.  Time is clever in the healing art.  If I were weak I should leave Naukratis and live in retirement for my grandchild alone; a whole world, believe me, lies slumbering in that young creature.  Many and many a time already I have longed to leave Egypt, and as often have conquered the wish.  Not because I cannot live without the homage of your sex; of that I have already had more than enough in my life, but because I feel that I, the slave-girl and the despised woman once, am now useful, necessary, almost indispensable indeed, to many free and noble men. Accustomed as I am, to an extended sphere of work, in its nature resembling a man's, I could not content myself in living for one being alone, however dear.  I should dry up like a plant removed from a rich soil into the desert, and should leave my grandchild desolate indeed, three times orphaned, and alone in the world.  No! I shall remain in Egypt.  \"Now that you are leaving, I shall be really indispensable to our friends here.  Amasis is old; when Psamtik comes to the throne we shall have infinitely greater difficulties to contend with than heretofore.  I must remain and fight on in the fore-front of our battle for the freedom and welfare of the Hellenic race.  Let them call my efforts unwomanly if they will.  This is, and shall be, the purpose of my life, a purpose to which I will remain all the more faithful, because it is one of those to which a woman rarely dares devote her life.  During this last night of tears I have felt that much, very much of that womanly weakness still lingers in me which forms at once the happiness and misery of our sex.  To preserve this feminine weakness in my granddaughter, united with perfect womanly delicacy, has been my first duty; my second to free myself entirely from it.  But a war against one's own nature cannot be carried on without occasional defeat, even if ultimately successful.  When grief and pain are gaining the upperhand and I am well nigh in despair, my only help lies in remembering my friend Pythagoras, that noblest among men, and his words: 'Observe a due proportion in all things, avoid excessive joy as well as complaining grief, and seek to keep thy soul in tune and harmony like a well-toned harp.'\"       [There is no question that Pythagoras visited Egypt during the reign      of Amasis, probably towards the middle of the 6th century (according      to our reckoning, about 536 B. C.) Herod. II. 81-123.  Diod. I. 98.      Rich information about Pythagoras is to be found in the works of the      very learned scholar Roeth, who is however occasionally much too      bold in his conjectures. Pythagoras was the first among Greek      thinkers (speculators).  He would not take the name of a wise man or      \"sage,\" but called himself \"Philosophos,\" or a \"friend of wisdom.\"]  \"This Pythagorean inward peace, this deep, untroubled calm, I see daily before me in my Sappho; and struggle to attain it myself, though many a stroke of fate untunes the chords of my poor heart.  I am calm now!  You would hardly believe what power the mere thought of that first of all thinkers, that calm, deliberate"]]]
