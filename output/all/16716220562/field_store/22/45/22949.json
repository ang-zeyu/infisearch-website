Then shall war and misery cease; for all that is fair and good on earth belongs to all men in common; and then all men shall be as willing to give and to help others, as they now are to seize and to oppress.--We have no marriage bond like other people; but when a man loves a woman he says, 'Will you be mine?' and if her heart consents she follows him home; and one may quit the other if love grows cold.  Still, no married couple, whether Christian or Parsee, ever clung together more faithfully than my parents or my grandparents; and we will do the same to the end, for our love will bind us firmly together with strong cords that will last longer than our lives.--So now you know the doctrine of our master Masdak; my father and grandfather both followed it, and I was taught it by my mother when I was a little child.  All in our village were Masdakites; and there was not a slave in the place; the land belonged to all in common and was tilled by all, and the harvest was equally shared.  However, they no longer receive strangers, and I must seek for fellow-believers elsewhere. Still, a Masdakite I shall always remain; and, if I were to take a slave for my wife, I should only be acting on the precepts of the master and helping them on.  But as for you, the case does not apply to you, for you are the child of a brave freeman, respected in all the land; our people will regard you as a prisoner of war, not as a slave.  They will look up to me as your deliverer.  And if I had found you, just as you are, the meanest of slaves and keeping pigs, I would have put my hand in my wallet at once and have bought your freedom and have carried you off home as my wife--and no Masdakite who saw you would ever blame me.  Now you know all about it, and there, I hope, is an end of your coyness and mincing.\"  Mandane, however, still would not yield; she looked at him with eyes that entreated his pity, and pointed to her cropped ears.  Rustem shrugged his shoulders with a laugh.  \"Of course, that too, into the bargain; You will not let me off any part of it!  If it had been your eyes now, you would not have been able to see, and no countryman can do with a blind wife, so I should leave you where you are.  But you, little one, have hearing as sharp as a bird's?  And what bird--pretty little things--did you ever see with ears, unless it were a bat or a nasty owl? --That is all nonsense.  Besides, who can see what you have lost now that Pulcheria has brought your hair down so prettily?  And do not you remember the head-dress our women wear?  You might have ears as long as a hare's, and what good would it do you?--no one could see them.  Just as you are, a lily grown like a cypress, you are ten times sweeter to look at than the prettiest girl there, if she had three or even four ears.  A girl with three ears!  Only think, Mandane, where could the third ear grow?\"  How heartily he laughed, and how glad he was to have hit on this jest and have turned off a subject which might so well be painful to her!  But his mirth failed of its effect, and only brought a silent smile to her lips. Even this died quickly away, and in its place there came such a sad, pathetic expression, as she hung her pretty head, that he could neither carry on the joke nor reproach her sharply.  He said compassionately, with a little shake of the head:  \"But you must not look like that, my pigeon: I cannot bear it.  What is it that is weighing on your little soul?  Courage, courage, sweetheart, and make a clean breast of it!--But no!  Do not speak.  I can spare you that!  I know, poor little darling--it is that old story of the governor's son.\"  She nodded, and her eyes filled with tears; and he, with a loud sigh, exclaimed: \"I thought as much, I was right, poor child!\"  He took her hand, and went on bravely:  \"Yes, that has given me some bad hours, too, and a great deal to think about; in fact, I came very near to leaving you alone and spoiling my own happiness and yours too.  But I came to my senses before it was too late. Not on account of what Dame Joanna said the day before yesterday--though what she says must be true, and she told me that all--you know what--was at an end.  No; my own sense told me this time; for I said to myself: Such a motherless, helpless little thing, a slave, too, and as pretty as the angels, her master's son took a fancy to her, how could she defend herself?  And how cruelly the poor little soul was punished!--Yes, little one, you may well weep!  Why, my own eyes are full of tears.  Well, so it had to be and so it was.  You and I and the Lord Almighty and the Hosts of Heaven--who can do anything against us?--So you see that even a poor fool like me can understand how it all came about; and I do not accuse you, nor have I anything to forgive.  It was just a dreadful misfortune. But it has come to a good end, thank God I and I can forget it entirely and for ever, if only you can say:  'It is all over and done with and buried like the dead!'\"  Before he could hinder her, she snatched his hand, to her lips with passionate affection and sobbed out:  \"You are so good!  Oh!  Rustem, there is not another man on earth so good as you are, and my mother will bless you for it.  Do what you will with me!  And I declare to you, once for all that all that is past and gone, and only to think of it gives me horror.  And it was exactly as you say: my mother dead, no one to warn me or protect me,--I was hardly sixteen, a simple, ignorant creature, and he called me, and it all came over me like a dream in my sleep; and when I awoke. . . .\"  \"There we are,\" he interrupted and he tried to laugh as he wiped his eyes.  \"Both laid up with holes in our heads.--And when I am in my own country I always think the prettiest time is just when the hard winter- frost is over, and the snow melted, and all the flowers in the valleys rush into bloom--and so I feel now, my little girl.  Everything will be well now, we shall be so wonderfully happy.  The day before yesterday, do you know, I still was not quite clear about it all.  Your trouble gave me no peace, and it went against the grain-well, you can understand.  But then, later, when I was lying in my room and the moon shone down on my bed. . .\"  and a rapt expression came into his face that strangely beautified his harsh features, \"I could not help asking myself: 'Although the moon went down into the sea this morning, does that prevent its shining as brightly as ever to-night, and bringing a cooler breeze?'  And if a human soul has gone under in the same way, may it not rise up again, bright and shining, when it has bathed and rested?  And such a heart--of course every man would like to have its love all to himself, but it may have enough to give more than once.  For, as I remembered, my mother, though she loved me dearly, when another child came and yet another gave them the best she had to give; and I was none the worse when she had my youngest sister at the breast, nor was she when I was petted and kissed. And it must be just the same with you.  Thought I to myself: though she once loved another man, she may still have a good share left for me!\"  \"Yes, indeed, Rustem !\"  she exclaimed, looking tearfully but gratefully into his eyes.  \"All that is in me of love and tenderness is for you--for you only.\"  At this he joyfully exclaimed:  \"All, that is indeed good hearing!  That will do for me; that is what I call a good morning's work!  I sat down under this tree a vagabond and a wanderer, and I get up a future land-holder, with the sweetest little wife in the world to keep house for me.\"  They sat a long time under the shady foliage; he craved no more than to gaze at her and, when he put the old questions asked by all lovers, to be answered with lips and eyes, or merely a speechless nod.  Her hands no longer plied the needle, and the pair would have smiled in pity on any one who should have complained of the intolerable heat of this scorching, parching forenoon.  A pair of turtle doves over their heads were less indifferent to the sun's rays than they, for the birds had closed their eyes, and the head of the mother bird was resting languidly against the dark collar round her mate's neck.

D.W.]      THE BRIDE OF THE NILE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 10.    CHAPTER XIII.  The Vekeel, like the Persian lovers, did not allow the heat of the day to interfere with his plans.  He regarded the governor's house as his own; all he found there aroused, not merely his avarice, but his interest. His first object was to find some document which might justify his proceedings against Orion and the sequestration of his estates, in the eyes of the authorities at Medina.  Great schemes were brewing there; if the conspiracy against the Khaliff Omar should succeed, he had little to fear; and the greater the sum he could ere long forward to the new sovereign, the more surely he could count on his patronage--a sum exceeding, if possible, the largest which his predecessor had ever cast into the Khaliff's treasury.  He went from room to room with the curiosity and avidity of a child, touching everything, testing the softness of the pillows, peeping into scrolls which he did not understand, tossing them aside, smelling at the perfumes in the dead woman's rooms, and the medicines she had used.  He showed his teeth with delight when he found in her trunks some costly jewels and gold coins, stuck the finest of her diamond rings on his finger, already covered with gems, and then eagerly searched every corner of the rooms which Orion had occupied.  His interpreter, who could read Greek, had to translate every document he found that did not contain verses.  While he listened, he clawed and strummed on the young man's lyre and poured out the scented oil which Orion had been wont to use to smear it over his beard.  In front of the bright silver mirror he could not cease from making faces.  To his great disgust he could find nothing among the hundred objects and trifles that lay about to justify suspicion, till, just as he was leaving the room, he noticed in a basket near the writing-table some discarded tablets.  He at once pointed them out to the interpreter and, though there was but little to read on the Diptychon,--[Double writing-tablets, which folded together]--it seemed important to the negro for it ran as follows:  \"Orion, the son of George, to Paula the daughter of Thomas!  \"You have heard already that it is now impossible for me to assist in the rescue of the nuns.  But do not misunderstand me.  Your noble, and only too well-founded desire to lend succor to your fellow-believers would have sufficed. . .\"  From this point the words written on the wax were carefully effaced, and hardly a letter was decipherable; indeed, there were so few lines that it seemed as though the letter had never been ended-which was the fact.  Though it gave the Vekeel no inculpating evidence against Orion it pointed to his connection with the guilty parties: Paula, doubtless, had been concerned in the scheme which had cost the lives of so many brave Moslems.  The negro had learnt, through the money-changer at Fostat, that she was on terms of close intimacy with the Mukaukas' son and had entrusted her property to his stewardship.  They must both be accused as accomplices in the deed, and the document proved Orion's knowledge of it, at any rate.  Plotinus, the bishop, at whose instigation the fugitives had been chased, could fill up what the damsel might choose to conceal.  He had started to follow the patriarch immediately after the pursuers had set out, and had only returned from Upper Egypt early on the previous day.  On his arrival he had forwarded to the Vekeel two indictments brought against Orion by the prelate: the first relating to the evasion of the nuns; the other to the embezzlement of a costly emerald; the rightful property of the church.  These accusations were what had encouraged the Negro to confiscate the young man's estate, particularly as the bitter tone of the patriarch's document sufficiently proved that in him he had found an ally.  Paula must next be placed in safe custody, and he had no doubt whatever that her statement would incriminate Orion in some degree.  He would gladly have cross-examined her at once, but he had other matters in hand to-day.  The longest part of his task was ransacking the treasurer's office; Nilus himself had to conduct the search.  Everything which he pointed out as a legal document, title-deed, contract for purchase or sale, revenue account or the like, was at once placed in oxcarts or on camels, with the large sums of gold and silver coin, and carried across the river under a strong escort.  All the more antique deeds and the family archives, the Vekeel left untouched. He was indeed an indefatigable man, for although these details kept him busy the whole day, he allowed himself no rest nor did he once ask for the refreshment of food or a cooling draught.  As the day went on he enquired again and again for the bishop, with increasing impatience and irritation.  It would have been his part to wait on the patriarch, but who was Plotinus?  Thin-skinned, like all up-starts in authority, he took the bishop's delay as an act of personal contumely. But the shepherd of the flock at Memphis was not a haughty prelate, but a very humble and pious minister.  His superior, the patriarch, had entrusted him with an important mission to Amru or his lieutenant, and yet he could let the Vekeel wait in vain, and not even send him a message of explanation; in the afternoon, however, his old housekeeper dispatched the acolyte who was attached to his person to seek Philippus.  Her master, a hale and vigorous man, had gone to bed by broad day-light a few hours after his return home, and had not again left it.  He was hot and thirsty, and did not seem fully conscious of where he was or of what was happening.  Plotinus had always maintained that prayer was the Christian's best medicine; still, as his poor body had become alarmingly heated the old woman ventured to send for the physician; but the messenger came back saying that Philippus was absent on a journey.  This was in fact the case: He had quitted Memphis in obedience to a letter from Haschim.  The merchant's unfortunate son was not getting better.  There seemed to be an injury to some internal organ, which threatened his life.  The anxious father besought the leech, in whom he had the greatest confidence, to hasten to Djidda, there to examine the sufferer and undertake the case. At the same time he desired that Rustem should join him as soon as his health would permit.  This letter--which ended with greetings to Paula, for whose father he was making diligent search--agitated Philippus greatly. How could he leave Memphis at a time of such famine and sickness?--And Dame Joanna and her daughter!  On the other hand he was much drawn to get away on Paula's account--away, far away; and then how gladly would he do his best to save that fine old man's son. In spite of all this he would have remained, but that his old friend, quite unexpectedly, took Haschim's side of the question and implored him to make the journey.  He would make it his business and his pleasure to take charge of the women in Rufinus' house; Philip's assistant could fill his place at the bedside of many of the sick, and the rest could die without him.  Had not he himself said that there was no remedy for the disease?  Again, Philip had said not long since that there could be no peace for him within reach of Paula: here was a favorable opportunity for escape without attracting remark, and at the same time for doing a work of the truest charity.  So Philippus had yielded, and had started on his journey with very mixed feelings.  Horapollo did not devote any particular attention to his personal comfort; but in one respect he took especial care of himself.  He had great difficulty in walking and, as he loved to breathe the fresh air at sundown, and sometimes to study the stars at a late hour, he kept an ass of the best and finest breed.  He did not hesitate to pay a high price for such a beast if it really answered his requirements; that is to say if it were strong, surefooted, gentle, and light-colored.  His father and grandfather, priests of Isis, had always ridden white asses, and so he would do the same.  During the last few sultry weeks he had rarely gone out of doors, and to-day he waited till the hour before sunset before starting to keep his promise.  Robed in snowy-white linen, with new sandals on his feet, freshly shaven, and protected from the sun's rays by a crisply curled, flowing wig, after the manner of his fathers, as well as by an umbrella, he mounted his beautiful white ass in the conviction that he had done his best for his outer man, and set forth, followed by his black slave trotting on foot.  It was not yet dark when he stopped at the house of Rufinus.  His heart had not beat so high for many a day.  \"I feel as if I had come courting,\" said he, laughing at himself.  \"Well, and I really am come to propose an alliance for the rest of my life! Still, curiosity, one would think, might be shed with the hair and the teeth!\"  However, it still clung to him, and he could not deny to himself that he was very curious as to the person whom he hated, though he had never seen her, simply because she was the daughter of a patrician and a prefect, and had made his Philippus miserable.  As he was dismounting, a graceful young girl and an older woman, in very costly though simple dresses, came through the garden.  These must be the waterwagtail, and Orion's Byzantine guest.--How annoying!  So many women at once!  Their presence here could only embarrass and disturb him--a lonely student unused to the society of women.  However, there was no help for it; and the new-comers were not so bad after all.
