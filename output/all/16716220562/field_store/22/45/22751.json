Klea had met these men in the antechamber as she quitted the high-priest, and had seen in the hand of one of them the key with which she had opened the door of the rock-tomb.  She had started, and her conscience urged her to go at once to the priest-smith, and tell him how ill she had fulfilled her errand.  When she entered his room Krates was sitting at his work with his feet wrapped up, and he was rejoiced to see her, for his anxiety for her and for Irene had disturbed his night's rest, and towards morning his alarm had been much increased by a frightful dream.  Klea, encouraged by the friendly welcome of the old man, who was usually so surly, confessed that she had neglected to deliver the key to the smith in the city, that she had used it to open the Apis-tombs, and had then forgotten to take it out of the new lock.  At this confession the old man broke out violently, he flung his file, and the iron bolt at which he was working, on to his work-table, exclaiming:  \"And this is the way you executed your commission.  It is the first time I ever trusted a woman, and this is my reward!  All this will bring evil on you and on me, and when it is found out that the sanctuary of Apis has been desecrated through my fault and yours, they will inflict all sorts of penance on me, and with very good reason--as for you, they will punish you with imprisonment and starvation.\"  \"And yet, father,\" Klea calmly replied, \"I feel perfectly guiltless, and perhaps in the same fearful situation you might not have acted differently.\"  \"You think so--you dare to believe such a thing?\"  stormed the old man. \"And if the key and perhaps even the lock have been stolen, and if I have done all that beautiful and elaborate work in vain?\"  \"What thief would venture into the sacred tombs?\"  asked Klea doubtfully.  \"What!  are they so unapproachable?\" interrupted Krates.  \"Why, a miserable creature like you even dared to open them.  But only wait--only wait; if only my feet were not so painful--\"  \"Listen to me,\" said the girl, going closer up to the indignant smith. \"You are discreet, as you proved to me only yesterday; and if I were to tell you all I went through and endured last night you would certainly forgive me, that I know.\"  \"If you are not altogether mistaken!\" shouted the smith.  \"Those must be strange things indeed which could induce me to let such neglect of duty and such a misdemeanor pass unpunished.\"  And strange things they were indeed which the old man now had to hear, for when Klea had ended her narrative of all that had occurred during the past night, not her eyes only but those of the old smith too were wet with tears.  \"These accursed legs!\"  he muttered, as his eyes met the enquiring glance of the young girl, and he wiped the salt dew from his cheeks with the sleeve of his coat.  \"Aye-a swelled foot like mine is painful, child, and a cripple such as I am is not always strong-minded.  Old women grow like men, and old men grow like women.  Ah! old age--it is bad to have such feet as mine, but what is worse is that memory fades as years advance. I believe now that I left the key myself in the door of the Apis-tombs last evening, and I will send at once to Asclepiodorus, so that he may beg the Egyptians up there to forgive me--they are indebted to me for many small jobs.\"     CHAPTER XXIV.  All the black masses of clouds which during the night had darkened the blue sky and hidden the light of the moon had now completely disappeared. The north-east wind which rose towards morning had floated them away, and Zeus, devourer of the clouds, had swallowed them up to the very last.  It was a glorious morning, and as the sun rose in the heavens, and pierced and burnt up with augmenting haste the pale mist that hovered over the Nile, and the vapor that hung--a delicate transparent veil of bluish-grey bombyx-gauze--over the eastern slopes, the cool shades of night vanished too from the dusky nooks of the narrow town which lay, mile-wide, along the western bank of the river.  And the intensely brilliant sunlight which now bathed the streets and houses, the palaces and temples, the gardens and avenues, and the innumerable vessels in the harbor of Memphis, was associated with a glow of warmth which was welcome even there in the early morning of a winter's day.  Boats' captains and sailors--were hurrying down to the shore of the Nile to avail themselves of the northeast breeze to travel southwards against the current, and sails were being hoisted and anchors heaved, to an accompaniment of loud singing.  The quay was so crowded with ships that it was difficult to understand how those that were ready could ever disentangle themselves, and find their way through those remaining behind; but each somehow found an outlet by which to reach the navigable stream, and ere long the river was swarming with boats, all sailing southwards, and giving it the appearance of an endless perspective of camp tents set afloat.  Long strings of camels with high packs, of more lightly laden asses, and of dark-colored slaves, were passing down the road to the harbor; these last were singing, as yet unhurt by the burden of the day, and the overseers' whips were still in their girdles.  Ox-carts were being laden or coming down to the landing-place with goods, and the ship's captains were already beginning to collect round the different great merchants--of whom the greater number were Greeks, and only a few dressed in Egyptian costume--in order to offer their freight for sale, or to hire out their vessels for some new expedition.  The greatest bustle and noise were at a part of the quay where, under large tents, the custom-house officials were busily engaged, for most vessels first cast anchor at Memphis to pay duty or Nile-toll on the \"king's table.\"  The market close to the harbor also was a gay scene; there dates and grain, the skins of beasts, and dried fish were piled in great heaps, and bleating and bellowing herds of cattle were driven together to be sold to the highest bidder.  Soldiers on foot and horseback in gaudy dresses and shining armor, mingled with the busy crowd, like peacocks and gaudy cocks among the fussy swarm of hens in a farm yard; lordly courtiers, in holiday dresses of showy red, blue and yellow stuffs, were borne by slaves in litters or standing on handsome gilt chariots; garlanded priests walked about in long white robes, and smartly dressed girls were hurrying down to the taverns near the harbor to play the flute or to dance.  The children that were playing about among this busy mob looked covetously at the baskets piled high with cakes, which the bakers' boys were carrying so cleverly on their heads.  The dogs innumerable, put up their noses as the dealers in such dainties passed near them, and many of them set up longing howls when a citizen's wife came by with her slaves, carrying in their baskets freshly killed fowls, and juicy meats to roast for the festival, among heaps of vegetables and fruits.  Gardeners' boys and young girls were bearing garlands of flowers, festoons and fragrant nosegays, some piled on large trays which they carried two and two, some on smaller boards or hung on cross poles for one to carry; at that part of the quay where the king's barge lay at anchor numbers of workmen were busily employed in twining festoons of greenery and flowers round the flag-staffs, and in hanging them with lanterns.  Long files of the ministers of the god-representing the five phyla or orders of the priesthood of the whole country--were marching, in holiday attire, along the harbor-road in the direction of the palace, and the jostling crowd respectfully made way for them to pass.  The gleams of festal splendor seemed interwoven with the laborious bustle on the quay like scraps of gold thread in a dull work-a-day garment.  Euergetes, brother of the king, was keeping his birthday in Memphis to- day, and all the city was to take part in the festivities.  At the first hour after sunrise victims had been sacrificed in the temple of Ptah, the most ancient, and most vast of the sanctuaries of the venerable capital of the Pharaohs; the sacred Apis-bull, but recently introduced into the temple, was hung all over with golden ornaments; early in the morning Euergetes had paid his devotions to the sacred beast--which had eaten out of his hand, a favorable augury of success for his plans; and the building in which the Apis lived, as well as the stalls of his mother and of the cows kept for him, had been splendidly decked with flowers.  The citizens of Memphis were not permitted to pursue their avocations or ply their trades beyond the hour of noon; then the markets, the booths, the workshops and schools were to be closed, and on the great square in front of the temple of Ptah, where the annual fair was held, dramas both sacred and profane, and shows of all sorts were to be seen, heard and admired by men, women and children--provided at the expense of the two kings.  Two men of Alexandria, one an AEolian of Lesbos, and the other a Hebrew belonging to the Jewish community, but who was not distinguishable by dress or accent from his Greek fellow-citizens, greeted each other on the quay opposite the landing-place for tho king's vessels, some of which were putting out into the stream, spreading their purple sails and dipping their prows inlaid with ivory and heavily gilt.  \"In a couple of hours,\" said the Jew, \"I shall be travelling homewards. May I offer you a place in my boat, or do you propose remaining here to assist at the festival and not starting till to-morrow morning?  There are all kinds of spectacles to be seen, and when it is dark a grand illumination is to take place.\"  \"What do I care for their barbarian rubbish?\"  answered the Lesbian. \"Why, the Egyptian music alone drives me to distraction.  My business is concluded.  I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5465"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 5 (#5)"],["body","inspected the goods brought from Arabia and India by way of Berenice and Coptos, and had selected those I needed before the vessel that brought them had moored in the Mariotic harbor, and other goods will have reached Alexandria before me.  I will not stay an hour longer than is necessary in this horrible place, which is as dismal as it is huge.  Yesterday I visited the gymnasium and the better class of baths--wretched, I call them!  It is an insult to the fish-market and the horse-ponds of Alexandria to compare them with them.\"  \"And the theatre!\"  exclaimed the Jew.  \"The exterior one can bear to look at--but the acting!  Yesterday they gave the 'Thals' of Menander, and I assure you that in Alexandria the woman who dared to impersonate the bewitching and cold-hearted Hetaira would have been driven off the stage--they would have pelted her with rotten apples.  Close by me there sat a sturdy, brown Egyptian, a sugar-baker or something of the kind, who held his sides with laughing, and yet, I dare swear, did not understand a word of the comedy.  But in Memphis it is the fashion to know Greek, even among the artisans.  May I hope to have you as my guest?\"  \"With pleasure, with pleasure!\"  replied the Lesbian.  \"I was about to look out for a boat.  Have you done your business to your satisfaction?\"  \"Tolerably!\"  answered the Jew.  \"I have purchased some corn from Upper Egypt, and stored it in the granaries here.  The whole of that row yonder were to let for a mere song, and so we get off cheaply when we let the wheat lie here instead of at Alexandria where granaries are no longer to be had for money.\"  \"That is very clever!\"  replied the Greek.  \"There is bustle enough here in the harbor, but the many empty warehouses and the low rents prove how Memphis is going down.  Formerly this city was the emporium for all vessels, but now for the most part they only run in to pay the toll and to take in supplies for their crews.  This populous place has a big stomach, and many trades drive a considerable business here, but most of those that fail here are still carried on in Alexandria.\"  \"It is the sea that is lacking,\" interrupted the Jew; \"Memphis trades only with Egypt, and we with the whole world.  The merchant who sends his goods here only load camels, and wretched asses, and flat-bottomed Nile- boats, while we in our harbors freight fine seagoing vessels.  When the winter-storms are past our house alone sends twenty triremes with Egyptian wheat to Ostia and to Pontus; and your Indian and Arabian goods, your imports from the newly opened Ethiopian provinces, take up less room, but I should like to know how many talents your trade amounted to in the course of the past year.  Well then, farewell till we meet again on my boat; it is called the Euphrosyne, and lies out there, exactly opposite the two statues of the old king--who can remember these stiff barbarian names?  In three hours we start.  I have a good cook on board, who is not too particular as to the regulations regarding food by which my countrymen in Palestine live, and you will find a few new books and some capital wine from Byblos.\"  \"Then we need not dread a head-wind,\" laughed the Lesbian.  \"We meet again in three hours.\"  The Israelite waved his hand to his travelling companion, and proceeded at first along the shore under the shade of an alley of sycamores with their broad unsymmetrical heads of foliage, but presently he turned aside into a narrow street which led from the quay to the city.  He stood still for a moment opposite the entrance of the corner house, one side of which lay parallel to the stream while the other--exhibiting the front door, and a small oil-shop--faced the street; his attention had been attracted to it by a strange scene; but he had still much to attend to before starting on his journey, and he soon hurried on again without noticing a tall man who came towards him, wearing a travelling-hat and a cloak such as was usually adapted only for making journeys.  The house at which the Jew had gazed so fixedly was that of Apollodorus, the sculptor, and the man who was so strangely dressed for a walk through the city at this hour of the day was the Roman, Publius Scipio.  He seemed to be still more attracted by what was going on in the little stall by the sculptor's front door, than even the Israelite had been; he leaned against the fence of the garden opposite the shop, and stood for some time gazing and shaking his head at the strange things that were to be seen within.  A wooden counter supported by the wall of the house-which was used by customers to lay their money on and which generally held a few oil-jars- projected a little way into the street like a window-board, and on this singular couch sat a distinguished looking youth in a light blue, sleeveless chiton, turning his back on the stall itself, which was not much bigger than a good sized travelling-chariot.  By his side lay a \"Himation\"--[A long square cloak, and an indispensable part of the dress of the Greeks.]--of fine white woolen stuff with a blue border.  His legs hung out into the street, and his brilliant color stood out in wonderful contrast to the dark skin of a naked Egyptian boy, who crouched at his feet with a cage full of doves.  The young Greek sitting on the window-counter had a golden fillet on his oiled and perfumed curls, sandals of the finest leather on his feet, and even in these humble surroundings looked elegant--but even more merry than elegant--for the whole of his handsome face was radiant with smiles while he tied two small rosy-grey turtle doves with ribands of rose- colored bombyx-silk to the graceful basket in which they were sitting, and then slipped a costly gold bracelet over the heads of the frightened birds, and attached it to their wings with a white silk tie.  When he had finished this work he held the basket up, looked at it with a smile of satisfaction, and he was in the very act of handing it to the black boy when he caught sight of Publius, who went up to him from the garden-fence.  \"In the name of all the gods, Lysias,\" cried the Roman, without greeting his friend, what fool's trick are you at there again!  Are you turned oil-seller, or have you taken to training pigeons?\"  \"I am the one, and I am doing the other,\" answered the Corinthian with a laugh, for he it was to whom the Roman's speech was addressed.  \"How do you like my nest of young doves?  It strikes me as uncommonly pretty, and how well the golden circlet that links their necks becomes the little creatures!\"  \"Here, put out your claws, you black crocodile,\" he continued, turning to his little assistant, \"carry the basket carefully into the house, and repeat what I say, 'From the love-sick Lysias to the fair Irene'--Only look, Publius, how the little monster grins at me with his white teeth. You shall hear that his Greek is far less faultless than his teeth. Prick up your ears, you little ichneumon--now once more repeat what you are to say in there--do you see where I am pointing with my finger?--to the master or to the lady who shall take the doves from you.\"  With much pitiful stammering the boy repeated the Corinthian's message to Irene, and as he stood there with his mouth wide open, Lysias, who was an expert at \"ducks and drakes\" on the water, neatly tossed into it a silver drachma.  This mouthful was much to the little rascal's taste, for after he had taken the coin out of his mouth he stood with wide-open jaws opposite his liberal master, waiting for another throw; Lysias however boxed him lightly on his ears, and chucked him under the chin, saying as he snapped the boy's teeth together:  \"Now carry up the birds and wait for the answer.\"  \"This offering is to Irene, then?\"  said Publius.  \"We have not met for a long time; where were you all day yesterday?\"  \"It will be far more entertaining to hear what you were about all the night long.  You are dressed as if you had come straight here from Rome. Euergetes has already sent for you once this morning, and the queen twice; she is over head and ears in love with you.\"  \"Folly!  Tell me now what you were doing all yesterday.\"  \"Tell me first where you have been.\"  \"I had to go some distance and will tell you all about it later, but not now; and I encountered strange things on my way--aye, I must say extraordinary things.  Before sunrise I found a bed in the inn yonder, and to my own great surprise I slept so soundly that I awoke only two. hours since.\"  \"That is a very meagre report; but I know of old that if you do not choose to speak no god could drag a syllable from you.  As regards myself I should do myself an injury by being silent, for my heart is like an overloaded beast of burden and talking will relieve it.  Ah!  Publius, my fate to-day is that of the helpless Tantalus, who sees juicy pears bobbing about under his nose and tempting his hungry stomach, and yet they never let him catch hold of them, only look-in there dwells Irene, the pear, the peach, the pomegranate, and my thirsting heart is consumed with longing for her.  You may laugh--but to-day Paris might meet Helen with impunity, for Eros has shot his whole store of arrows into me.  You cannot see them, but I can feel them, for not one of them has he drawn out of the wound.  And the darling little thing herself is not wholly untouched by the winged boy's darts.  She has confessed so much to me myself.  It is impossible for me to refuse her any thing, and so I was fool enough to swear a horrible oath that I would not try to see her till she was reunited to her tall solemn sister, of whom I am exceedingly afraid.  Yesterday I lurked outside this house just as a hungry wolf in cold weather sneaks about a temple where lambs are being sacrificed, only to see her, or at least to hear a word from her lips, for when she speaks it is like the song of nightingales--but all in vain.  Early this morning I came back to the city and to this spot; and as hanging about "]]]
