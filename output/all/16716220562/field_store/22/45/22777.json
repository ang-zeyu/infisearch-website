As the room had remained unused for months, bats had made nests there, and now that it was lighted, dazzled by the glare of the lamps and candles, they darted to and fro above the heads of the assembly.  Iras had ordered the commander of the Mellakes, or youths, a body-guard composed of the sons of aristocratic Macedonian families, to expel the troublesome creatures, and it diverted the thoughts of these devoted soldiers of the Queen to strike at them with their swords.  Others preferred to watch this futile battle rather than give themselves up to the anxiety which filled their minds.  The Regent was gazing mutely at the ground; Iras, pale and absent-minded, was listening to Zeno's statements; and Archibius had gone out of doors, and, unheeding the storm, was looking across the tossing waves of the harbour for the expected ships.  In a wooden shed, whose roof was supported by gaily painted pillars, through which the wind whistled, the servants, from the porters to the litter-bearers, had gathered in groups under the flickering light of the lanterns.  The Greeks sat on wooden stools, the Egyptians upon mats on the floor.  The largest circle contained the parties who attended to the Queen's luggage and the upper servants, among whom were several maids.  They had been told that the Queen was expected that night, because it was possible that the strong north wind would bear her ship home with unexpected speed after the victory.  But they were better informed: palaces have chinks in doors and curtains, and are pervaded by a very peculiar echo which bears even a whisper distinctly from ear to ear.  The body-slave of the commander-in-chief Seleukus was the principal spokesman.  His master had reached Alexandria but a few hours ago from the frontier fortress of Pelusium, which he commanded.  A mysterious order from Lucilius, Antony's most faithful friend, brought from Taenarum by a swift galley, had summoned him hither.  The freedman Beryllus, a loquacious Sicilian, who, as an actor, had seen better days ere pirates robbed him of his liberty, had heard many new things, and his hearers listened eagerly; for ships coming from the north, which touched at Pelusium, had confirmed and completed the evil tidings that had penetrated the Sebasteum.  According to his story, he was as well informed as if he had been an eye- witness of the naval battle; for he had been present during his master's conversation with many ship-captains and messengers from Greece.  He even assumed the air of a loyal, strictly silent servant, who would only venture to confirm and deny what the Alexandrians had already learned. Yet his knowledge consisted merely of a confused medley of false and true occurrences.  While the Egyptian fleet had been defeated at Actium, and Antony, flying with Cleopatra, had gone first to Taenarum at the end of the Peloponnesian coast, he asserted that the army and fleet had met on the Peloponnesian coast and Octavianus was pursuing Antony, who had turned towards Athens, while Cleopatra was on her way to Alexandria.  His  \"trustworthy  intelligence\"  had  been patched together from a few words caught from Seleukus at table, or while receiving and dismissing messengers.  In other matters his information was more accurate.  While for several days the harbour of Alexandria had been closed, vessels were permitted to enter Pelusium, and all captains of newly arrived ships and caravans were compelled to report to Beryllus's master, the commandant of the important frontier fortress.  He had quitted Pelusium the night before.  The strong wind had driven the trireme before it so swiftly that it was difficult for even the sea gulls to follow.  It was easy for the listeners to believe this; for the storm outside howled louder and louder, whistling through the open hall where the servants had gathered.  Most of the lamps and torches had been blown out, the pitch-pans only sent forth still blacker clouds of smoke, lit by red and yellow flames, and the closed lanterns alone continued to diffuse a flickering light.  So the wide space, dim with smoke, was illumined only by a dull, varying glimmer.  One of the porters had furnished wine to shorten the hours of waiting; but it could only be drunk in secret, so there were no goblets.  The jars wandered from mouth to mouth, and every sip was welcome, for the wind blew keenly, and besides, the smoke irritated their throats.  The freedman, Beryllus, was often interrupted by paroxysms of coughing, especially from the women, while relating the evil omens which were told to his master in Pelusium.  Each was well authenticated and surpassed its predecessor in significance.  Here one of Iras's maids interrupted him to tell the story of the swallows on the \"Antonius,\" Cleopatra's admiral galley.  He could scarcely report from Pelusium an omen of darker presage.  But Beryllus gazed at her with a pitying smile, which so roused the expectations of the others that the overseer of the litter and baggage porters, who were talking loudly together, hoarsely shouted, \"Silence!\"  Soon no sound was heard in the open space save the shrill whistling of the wind, a word of command to the harbour-guards, and the freedman's voice, which he lowered to increase the charm of the mysterious events he was describing.  He began with the most fulsome praise of Cleopatra and Antony, reminding his hearers that the Imperator was a descendant of Herakles.  The Alexandrians especially were aware that their Queen and Antony claimed and desired to be called \"The new Isis\" and \"The new Dionysus.\"  But every one who beheld the Roman must admit that in face and figure he resembled a god far more than a man.  The Imperator had appeared as Dionysus, especially to the Athenians.  In the proscenium of the theatre in that city was a huge bas-relief of the Battle of the Giants, the famous work of an ancient sculptor--he, Beryllus, had seen it--and from amid the numerous figures in this piece of sculpture the tempest had torn but a single one--which?  Dionysus, the god as whose mortal image Antony had once caroused in a vine-clad arbour in the presence of the Athenians.  The storm to-night was at the utmost like the breath of a child, compared with the hurricane which could wrest from the hard marble the form of Dionysus.  But Nature gathers all her forces when she desires to announce to short-sighted mortals the approach of events which are to shake the world.  The last words were quoted from his master who had studied in Athens. They had escaped from his burdened soul when he heard of another portent, of which a ship from Ostia had brought tidings.  The flourishing city Pisaura--  Here, however, he was interrupted, for several of those present had learned, weeks before, that this place had sunk in the sea, but merely pitied the unfortunate inhabitants.  Beryllus quietly permitted them to free themselves from the suspicion that people in Alexandria had had tidings of so remarkable an event later than those in Pelusium, and at first answered their query what this had to do with the war merely by a shrug of the shoulders; but when the overseer of the porters also put the question, he went on \"The omen made a specially deep impression upon our minds, for we know what Pisaura is, or rather how it came into existence.  The hapless city which dark Hades ingulfed really belonged to Antony, for in the days of its prosperity he was its founder.\"  He measured the group with a defiant glance, and there was no lack of evidences of horror; nay, one of the maid-servants shrieked aloud, for the storm had just snatched a torch from the iron rings in the wall and hurled it on the floor close beside the listener.  Suspense seemed to have reached its height.  Yet it was evident that Beryllus had not yet drawn his last arrow from the quiver.  The maid-servant, whose scream had startled the others, had regained her composure and seemed eager to hear some other new and terrible omen, for, with a beseeching glance, she begged the freedman not to withhold the knew.  He pointed to the drops of perspiration which, spite of the wind sweeping through the hall, covered her brow: \"You must use your handkerchief. Merely listening to my tale will dampen your skin.  Stone statues are made of harder material, but a soul dwells within them too.  Their natures may be harsher or more gentle; they bring us woe or heal heavy sorrows, according to their mood.  Every one learns this who raises his hands to them in prayer.  One of these statues stands in Alba.  It represents Mark Antony, in whose honour it was erected by the city.  And it foresaw what menaced the man whose stone double it is.  Ay, open your ears!  About four days ago a ship's captain came to my master and in my presence this man reported--he grew as pale as ashes while he spoke--what he himself had witnessed.  Drops of perspiration had oozed from the statue of Antony in Alba.  Horror seized all the citizens; men and women came to wipe the brow and cheeks of the statue, but the drops of perspiration did not cease to drip, and this continued several days and nights.  The stone image had felt what was impending over the living Mark Antony.  It was a horrible spectacle, the man said.\"  Here the speaker paused, and the group of listeners started, for the clang of a gong was heard outside, and the next instant all were on their feet hastening to their posts.  The officials in the magnificent hall had also risen.  Here the silence had been interrupted only by low whispers.  The colour had faded from most of the grave, anxious faces, and their timid glances shunned one another.  Archibius had first perceived, by the flames of the Pharos, the red glimmer which announced the approach of the royal galley.  It had not been expected so early, but was already passing the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5476"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 04 (#4)"],["body","into the great harbour.  It was probably the Antonius, the ship on which the old swallows had pecked the young ones to death.  Though the waves were running high, even in the sheltered harbour, they scarcely rocked the massive vessel.  An experienced pilot must have steered it past the shallows and cliffs on the eastern side of the roadstead, for instead of passing around the island of Antirrhodus as usual, it kept between the island and the Lochias, steering straight towards the entrance into the little royal harbour.  The pitch-pans on both sides had been filled with fresh resin and tow to light the way. The watchers on the shore could now see its outlines distinctly.  It was the Antonius, and yet it was not.  Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, who was standing beside Iras, wrapped his cloak closer around his shivering limbs, pointed to it, and whispered,  \"Like a woman who leaves her parents' house in the rich array of a bride, and returns to it an impoverished widow.\"  Iras drew herself up, and with cutting harshness replied, \"Like the sun veiled by mists, but which will soon shine forth again more radiantly than ever.\"  \"Spoken from the depths of my soul,\" said the old courtier eagerly, \"so far as the Queen is concerned.  Of course, I did not allude to her Majesty, but to the ship.  You were ill when it left the harbour, garlanded with flowers and adorned with purple sails.  And now!  Even this flickering light shows the wounds and rents.  I am the last person whom you need tell that our sun Cleopatra will soon regain its old radiance, but at present it is very chilly and cold here by the water's edge in this stormy air; and when I think of our first moment of meeting--  \"Would it were over!\"  murmured Iras, wrapping herself closer in her cloak.  Then she drew back shivering, for the rattle of the heavy chain, which was drawn aside from the opening of the harbour, echoed with an uncanny sound through the silence of the night.  A mountain seemed to weigh upon the watchers' breasts, for the wooden monster which now entered the little harbour moved forward as slowly and silently as a spectral ship.  It seemed as if life were extinct on the huge galley usually swarming with a numerous crew; as if a vessel were about to cast anchor whose sailors had fallen victims to the plague.  Nothing was heard save an occasional word of command, and the signal whistles of the fluteplayer who directed the rowers.  A few lanterns burned with a wavering light on the vast length of her decks.  The brilliant illumination which usually shone through the darkness would have attracted the attention of the Alexandrians.  Now it was close to the landing.  The group on shore watched every inch of its majestic progress with breathless suspense, but when the first rope was flung to the slaves on shore several men in Greek robes pressed forward hurriedly among the courtiers.  They had come with a message, whose importance would permit no delay, to the Regent Mardion, who stood between Zeno and Iras, gazing gloomily at the ground with a frowning brow.  He was pondering over the words in which to address the Queen, and within a few minutes the ship would have made her landing, and Cleopatra might cross the bridge.  To disturb him at that moment was an undertaking few who knew the irritable, uncertain temper of the eunuch would care to risk.  But the tall Macedonian, who for a short time attracted the eyes of most of the spectators from the galley, ventured to do so.  It was the captain of the nightwatch, the aristocratic commander of the police force of the city.  \"Only a word, my lord,\" he whispered to the Regent, \"though the time may be inopportune.\"  \"As inopportune as possible,\" replied the eunuch with repellent harshness.  \"We will say as inopportune as the degree of haste necessary for its decision.  The King Caesarion, with Antyllus and several companions, attacked a woman.  Blackened faces.  A fight.  Caesarion and the woman's companion--an aristocrat, member of the Council--slightly wounded. Lictors interfered just in time.  The young gentlemen were arrested. At first they refused to give their names--\"  \"Caesarion slightly, really only slightly wounded?\" asked the eunuch with eager haste.  \"Really and positively.  Olympus was summoned at once.  A knock on the head.  The man who was attacked flung him on the pavement in the struggle.\"  \"Dion, the son of Eumenes, is the man,\" interrupted Iras, whose quick ear had caught the officer's report.  \"The woman is Barine, the daughter of the artist Leonax.\"  \"Then you know already?\" asked the Macedonian in surprise.  \"So it seems,\" answered Mardion, gazing into the girl's face with a significant glance.  Then, turning to her rather than to the Macedonian, he added, \"I think we will have the young rascals set free and brought to Lochias with as little publicity as possible.\"  \"To the palace?\" asked the Macedonian.  \"Of course,\" replied Iras firmly.  \"Each to his own apartments, where they must remain until further orders.\"  \"Everything else must be deferred until after the reception,\" added the eunuch, and the Macedonian, with a slight, haughty nod, drew back.  \"Another misfortune,\" sighed the eunuch.  \"A boyish prank,\" Iras answered quickly, \"but even a still greater misfortune is less than nothing so long as we are not conscious of it. This unpleasant occurrence must be concealed for the present from the Queen.  Up to this time it is a vexation, nothing more--and it can and must remain so; for we have it in our power to uproot the poisonous tree whence it emanates.\"  \"You look as if no one could better perform the task,\" the Regent interrupted, with a side glance at the galley, \"so you shall have the commission.  It is the last one I shall give, during the Queen's absence, in her name.\"  \"I shall not fail,\" she answered firmly.  When Iras again looked towards the landing-place she saw Archibius standing alone, with his eyes fixed upon the ground.  Impulse prompted her to tell her uncle what had happened; but at the first step she paused, and her thin lips uttered a firm \"No.\"  Her friend had become a stone in her path.  If necessary, she would find means to thrust him also aside, spite of his sister Charmian and the old tie which united him to Cleopatra.  He had grown weak, Charmian had always been so.  She would have had time enough now to consider what step to take first, had not her heart ached so sorely.  After the huge galley lay moored, several minutes elapsed ere two pastophori of the goddess Isis, who guarded the goblet of Nektanebus, taken from the temple treasures and borne along in a painted chest, stepped upon the bridge, followed by Cleopatra's first chamberlain, who in a low tone announced the approach of the Queen and commanded the waiting groups to make way.  A double line of torch-bearers had been stationed from the landing to the gate leading into the Bruchium, and the other on the north, which was the entrance to the palaces on the Lochias, since it was not known where Cleopatra would desire to go.  The chamberlain, however, said that she would spend the night at Lochias, where the children lived, and ordered all the flickering, smoking torches, save a few, to be extinguished.  Mardion, the Keeper of the Seal, Archibius, and Iras were standing by the bridge a little in advance of the others, when voices were heard on the ship, and the Queen appeared, preceded by several lantern-bearers and followed by a numerous train of court officials, pages, maids, and female slaves.  Cleopatra's little hand rested on Charmian's arm, as, with a haughty carriage of the head, she moved towards the shore.  A thick veil covered her face, and a large, dark cloak concealed her figure.  How elastic her step was still! how proud yet graceful was the gesture with which she waved a greeting to Mardion and Zeno.  Extending her hand to raise Iras, who had sunk prostrate before her, she kissed her on the forehead, whispering, \"The children?\"  \"All is well with them,\" replied the girl.  Then the returning sovereign greeted the others with a gracious gesture, but vouchsafed a word to no one until the eunuch stepped before her to deliver his address of welcome.  She motioned him aside with a curt \"Later\"; and when Zeno held open the door of the litter, she said in a stifled tone: \"I will walk.  After the rocking of the galley in this tempest, I feel reluctant to enter the litter.  There are many things to be considered to-day.  An idea carne to me on the way home.  Summon the captain of the harbour and his chief counsellors, the heads of the war office, the superintendent of the fortifications on land and water, especially the Aristarch and Gorgias--I want to see them.  Time presses. They must be here in two hours-no, in an hour and a half.  I wish to examine all their plans and charts of the eastern frontier, especially the river channels and canals in the Delta.\"  Then she turned to Archibius, who had approached the litter, laid her hand upon his arm, and though her veil prevented him from seeing her sparkling eyes, he felt them shining deep into his heart, as the voice whose melody had often enthralled his soul cried, \"We will take it as a favourable omen that it is again you who lead me to this palace in a time of trouble.\"  His overflowing heart found expression in the warm reply, \"Whenever it may be, forever and ever this arm and this life are yours!\"  And the Queen answered in a tone of earnest belief, \"I know it.\"  Then, with her hand still resting on his arm, she moved forward; but when he began to ask whether she really had cause to speak of a time of trouble, she cut him short with the entreaty \"Not now.  Let us say nothing.  It is worse than bad--as evil as possible.  Yet no.  Few are permitted, in an hour of trouble, to lean on the arm of a faithful friend.\"  The words were accompanied with a light pressure of her little hand, and it seemed as if his old heart was growing young.
