That night we spent beside a little stream in the Sto-lu country.  We found a tiny cave in the rock bank, so hidden away that only chance could direct a beast of prey to it, and after we had eaten of the deer-meat and some fruit which Ajor gathered, we crawled into the little hole, and with sticks and stones which I had gathered for the purpose I erected a strong barricade inside the entrance.  Nothing could reach us without swimming and wading through the stream, and I felt quite secure from attack.  Our quarters were rather cramped.  The ceiling was so low that we could not stand up, and the floor so narrow that it was with difficulty that we both wedged into it together; but we were very tired, and so we made the most of it; and so great was the feeling of security that I am sure I fell asleep as soon as I had stretched myself beside Ajor.  During the three days which followed, our progress was exasperatingly slow.  I doubt if we made ten miles in the entire three days.  The country was hideously savage, so that we were forced to spend hours at a time in hiding from one or another of the great beasts which menaced us continually.  There were fewer reptiles; but the quantity of carnivora seemed to have increased, and the reptiles that we did see were perfectly gigantic.  I shall never forget one enormous specimen which we came upon browsing upon water-reeds at the edge of the great sea.  It stood well over twelve feet high at the rump, its highest point, and with its enormously long tail and neck it was somewhere between seventy-five and a hundred feet in length.  Its head was ridiculously small; its body was unarmored, but its great bulk gave it a most formidable appearance.  My experience of Caspakian life led me to believe that the gigantic creature would but have to see us to attack us, and so I raised my rifle and at the same time drew away toward some brush which offered concealment; but Ajor only laughed, and picking up a stick, ran toward the great thing, shouting.  The little head was raised high upon the long neck as the animal stupidly looked here and there in search of the author of the disturbance.  At last its eyes discovered tiny little Ajor, and then she hurled the stick at the diminutive head.  With a cry that sounded not unlike the bleat of a sheep, the colossal creature shuffled into the water and was soon submerged.  As I slowly recalled my collegiate studies and paleontological readings in Bowen's textbooks, I realized that I had looked upon nothing less than a diplodocus of the Upper Jurassic; but how infinitely different was the true, live thing from the crude restorations of Hatcher and Holland!  I had had the idea that the diplodocus was a land-animal, but evidently it is partially amphibious.  I have seen several since my first encounter, and in each case the creature took to the sea for concealment as soon as it was disturbed.  With the exception of its gigantic tail, it has no weapon of defense; but with this appendage it can lash so terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear, stunned and broken.  It is a stupid, simple, gentle beast--one of the few within Caspak which such a description might even remotely fit.  For three nights we slept in trees, finding no caves or other places of concealment.  Here we were free from the attacks of the large land carnivora; but the smaller flying reptiles, the snakes, leopards, and panthers were a constant menace, though by no means as much to be feared as the huge beasts that roamed the surface of the earth.  At the close of the third day Ajor and I were able to converse with considerable fluency, and it was a great relief to both of us, especially to Ajor.  She now did nothing but ask questions whenever I would let her, which could not be all the time, as our preservation depended largely upon the rapidity with which I could gain knowledge of the geography and customs of Caspak, and accordingly I had to ask numerous questions myself.  I enjoyed immensely hearing and answering her, so naive were many of her queries and so filled with wonder was she at the things I told her of the world beyond the lofty barriers of Caspak; not once did she seem to doubt me, however marvelous my statements must have seemed; and doubtless they were the cause of marvel to Ajor, who before had never dreamed that any life existed beyond Caspak and the life she knew.  Artless though many of her questions were, they evidenced a keen intellect and a shrewdness which seemed far beyond her years or her experience.  Altogether I was finding my little savage a mighty interesting and companionable person, and I often thanked the kind fate that directed the crossing of our paths.  From her I learned much of Caspak, but there still remained the mystery that had proved so baffling to Bowen Tyler--the total absence of young among the ape, the semihuman and the human races with which both he and I had come in contact upon opposite shores of the inland sea.  Ajor tried to explain the matter to me, though it was apparent that she could not conceive how so natural a condition should demand explanation.  She told me that among the Galus there were a few babies, that she had once been a baby but that most of her people \"came up,\" as he put it, \"_cor sva jo_,\" or literally, \"from the beginning\"; and as they all did when they used that phrase, she would wave a broad gesture toward the south.  \"For long,\" she explained, leaning very close to me and whispering the words into my ear while she cast apprehensive glances about and mostly skyward, \"for long my mother kept me hidden lest the Wieroo, passing through the air by night, should come and take me away to Oo-oh.\"  And the child shuddered as she voiced the word.  I tried to get her to tell me more; but her terror was so real when she spoke of the Wieroo and the land of Oo-oh where they dwell that I at last desisted, though I did learn that the Wieroo carried off only female babes and occasionally women of the Galus who had \"come up from the beginning.\" It was all very mysterious and unfathomable, but I got the idea that the Wieroo were creatures of imagination--the demons or gods of her race, omniscient and omnipresent.  This led me to assume that the Galus had a religious sense, and further questioning brought out the fact that such was the case.  Ajor spoke in tones of reverence of Luata, the god of heat and life.  The word is derived from two others:  _Lua_, meaning sun, and _ata_, meaning variously _eggs_, _life_, _young_, and _reproduction_.  She told me that they worshiped Luata in several forms, as fire, the sun, eggs and other material objects which suggested heat and reproduction.  I had noticed that whenever I built a fire, Ajor outlined in the air before her with a forefinger an isosceles triangle, and that she did the same in the morning when she first viewed the sun.  At first I had not connected her act with anything in particular, but after we learned to converse and she had explained a little of her religious superstitions, I realized that she was making the sign of the triangle as a Roman Catholic makes the sign of the cross.  Always the short side of the triangle was uppermost.  As she explained all this to me, she pointed to the decorations on her golden armlets, upon the knob of her dagger-hilt and upon the band which encircled her right leg above the knee--always was the design partly made up of isosceles triangles, and when she explained the significance of this particular geometric figure, I at once grasped its appropriateness.  We were now in the country of the Band-lu, the spearmen of Caspak. Bowen had remarked in his narrative that these people were analogous to the so-called Cro-Magnon race of the Upper Paleolithic, and I was therefore very anxious to see them.  Nor was I to be disappointed; I saw them, all right!  We had left the Sto-lu country and literally fought our way through cordons of wild beasts for two days when we decided to make camp a little earlier than usual, owing to the fact that we had reached a line of cliffs running east and west in which were numerous likely cave-lodgings.  We were both very tired, and the sight of these caverns, several of which could be easily barricaded, decided us to halt until the following morning.  It took but a few minutes' exploration to discover one particular cavern high up the face of the cliff which seemed ideal for our purpose.  It opened upon a narrow ledge where we could build our cook-fire; the opening was so small that we had to lie flat and wriggle through it to gain ingress, while the interior was high-ceiled and spacious.  I lighted a faggot and looked about; but as far as I could see, the chamber ran back into the cliff.  Laying aside my rifle, pistol and heavy ammunition-belt, I left Ajor in the cave while I went down to gather firewood.  We already had meat and fruits which we had gathered just before reaching the cliffs, and my canteen was filled with fresh water.  Therefore, all we required was fuel, and as I always saved Ajor's strength when I could, I would not permit her to accompany me.  The poor girl was very tired; but she would have gone with me until she dropped, I know, so loyal was she. She was the best comrade in the world, and sometimes I regretted and sometimes I was glad that she was not of my own caste, for had she been, I should unquestionably have fallen in love with her.  As it was, we traveled together like two boys, with huge respect for each other but no softer sentiment.  There was little timber close to the base of the cliffs, and so I was forced to enter the wood some two hundred yards distant.  I realize now how foolhardy was my act in such a land as Caspak, teeming with danger and with death; but there is a certain amount of fool in every man; and whatever proportion of it I own must have been in the ascendant that day, for the truth of the matter is that I went down into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/552"],["title","The People That Time Forgot (#7)"],["body"," woods absolutely defenseless; and I paid the price, as people usually do for their indiscretions.  As I searched around in the brush for likely pieces of firewood, my head bowed and my eyes upon the ground, I suddenly felt a great weight hurl itself upon me.  I struggled to my knees and seized my assailant, a huge, naked man--naked except for a breechcloth of snakeskin, the head hanging down to the knees.  The fellow was armed with a stone-shod spear, a stone knife and a hatchet. In his black hair were several gay-colored feathers.  As we struggled to and fro, I was slowly gaining advantage of him, when a score of his fellows came running up and overpowered me.  They bound my hands behind me with long rawhide thongs and then surveyed me critically.  I found them fine-looking specimens of manhood, for the most part.  There were some among them who bore a resemblance to the Sto-lu and were hairy; but the majority had massive heads and not unlovely features.  There was little about them to suggest the ape, as in the Sto-lu, Bo-lu and Alus.  I expected them to kill me at once, but they did not.  Instead they questioned me; but it was evident that they did not believe my story, for they scoffed and laughed.  \"The Galus have turned you out,\" they cried.  \"If you go back to them, you will die.  If you remain here, you will die.  We shall kill you; but first we shall have a dance and you shall dance with us--the dance of death.\"  It sounded quite reassuring!  But I knew that I was not to be killed immediately, and so I took heart.  They led me toward the cliffs, and as we approached them, I glanced up and was sure that I saw Ajor's bright eyes peering down upon us from our lofty cave; but she gave no sign if she saw me; and we passed on, rounded the end of the cliffs and proceeded along the opposite face of them until we came to a section literally honeycombed with caves.  All about, upon the ground and swarming the ledges before the entrances, were hundreds of members of the tribe.  There were many women but no babes or children, though I noticed that the females had better developed breasts than any that I had seen among the hatchet-men, the club-men, the Alus or the apes.  In fact, among the lower orders of Caspakian man the female breast is but a rudimentary organ, barely suggested in the apes and Alus, and only a little more defined in the Bo-lu and Sto-lu, though always increasingly so until it is found about half developed in the females of the spear-men; yet never was there an indication that the females had suckled young; nor were there any young among them.  Some of the Band-lu women were quite comely.  The figures of all, both men and women, were symmetrical though heavy, and though there were some who verged strongly upon the Sto-lu type, there were others who were positively handsome and whose bodies were quite hairless.  The Alus are all bearded, but among the Bo-lu the beard disappears in the women. The Sto-lu men show a sparse beard, the Band-lu none; and there is little hair upon the bodies of their women.  The members of the tribe showed great interest in me, especially in my clothing, the like of which, of course, they never had seen.  They pulled and hauled upon me, and some of them struck me; but for the most part they were not inclined to brutality.  It was only the hairier ones, who most closely resembled the Sto-lu, who maltreated me.  At last my captors led me into a great cave in the mouth of which a fire was burning.  The floor was littered with filth, including the bones of many animals, and the atmosphere reeked with the stench of human bodies and putrefying flesh.  Here they fed me, releasing my arms, and I ate of half-cooked aurochs steak and a stew which may have been made of snakes, for many of the long, round pieces of meat suggested them most nauseatingly.  The meal completed, they led me well within the cavern, which they lighted with torches stuck in various crevices in the light of which I saw, to my astonishment, that the walls were covered with paintings and etchings.  There were aurochs, red deer, saber-tooth tiger, cave-bear, hyaenadon and many other examples of the fauna of Caspak done in colors, usually of four shades of brown, or scratched upon the surface of the rock.  Often they were super-imposed upon each other until it required careful examination to trace out the various outlines.  But they all showed a rather remarkable aptitude for delineation which further fortified Bowen's comparisons between these people and the extinct Cro-Magnons whose ancient art is still preserved in the caverns of Niaux and Le Portel.  The Band-lu, however, did not have the bow and arrow, and in this respect they differ from their extinct progenitors, or descendants, of Western Europe.  Should any of my friends chance to read the story of my adventures upon Caprona, I hope they will not be bored by these diversions, and if they are, I can only say that I am writing my memoirs for my own edification and therefore setting down those things which interested me particularly at the time.  I have no desire that the general public should ever have access to these pages; but it is possible that my friends may, and also certain savants who are interested; and to them, while I do not apologize for my philosophizing, I humbly explain that they are witnessing the gropings of a finite mind after the infinite, the search for explanations of the inexplicable.  In a far recess of the cavern my captors bade me halt.  Again my hands were secured, and this time my feet as well.  During the operation they questioned me, and I was mighty glad that the marked similarity between the various tribal tongues of Caspak enabled us to understand each other perfectly, even though they were unable to believe or even to comprehend the truth of my origin and the circumstances of my advent in Caspak; and finally they left me saying that they would come for me before the dance of death upon the morrow.  Before they departed with their torches, I saw that I had not been conducted to the farthest extremity of the cavern, for a dark and gloomy corridor led beyond my prison room into the heart of the cliff.  I could not but marvel at the immensity of this great underground grotto.  Already I had traversed several hundred yards of it, from many points of which other corridors diverged.  The whole cliff must be honeycombed with apartments and passages of which this community occupied but a comparatively small part, so that the possibility of the more remote passages being the lair of savage beasts that have other means of ingress and egress than that used by the Band-lu filled me with dire forebodings.  I believe that I am not ordinarily hysterically apprehensive; yet I must confess that under the conditions with which I was confronted, I felt my nerves to be somewhat shaken.  On the morrow I was to die some sort of nameless death for the diversion of a savage horde, but the morrow held fewer terrors for me than the present, and I submit to any fair-minded man if it is not a terrifying thing to lie bound hand and foot in the Stygian blackness of an immense cave peopled by unknown dangers in a land overrun by hideous beasts and reptiles of the greatest ferocity.  At any moment, perhaps at this very moment, some silent-footed beast of prey might catch my scent where it laired in some contiguous passage, and might creep stealthily upon me.  I craned my neck about, and stared through the inky darkness for the twin spots of blazing hate which I knew would herald the coming of my executioner. So real were the imaginings of my overwrought brain that I broke into a cold sweat in absolute conviction that some beast was close before me; yet the hours dragged, and no sound broke the grave-like stillness of the cavern.  During that period of eternity many events of my life passed before my mental vision, a vast parade of friends and occurrences which would be blotted out forever on the morrow.  I cursed myself for the foolish act which had taken me from the search-party that so depended upon me, and I wondered what progress, if any, they had made.  Were they still beyond the barrier cliffs, awaiting my return?  Or had they found a way into Caspak?  I felt that the latter would be the truth, for the party was not made up of men easily turned from a purpose.  Quite probable it was that they were already searching for me; but that they would ever find a trace of me I doubted.  Long since, had I come to the conclusion that it was beyond human prowess to circle the shores of the inland sea of Caspak in the face of the myriad menaces which lurked in every shadow by day and by night.  Long since, had I given up any hope of reaching the point where I had made my entry into the country, and so I was now equally convinced that our entire expedition had been worse than futile before ever it was conceived, since Bowen J.  Tyler and his wife could not by any possibility have survived during all these long months; no more could Bradley and his party of seamen be yet in existence.  If the superior force and equipment of my party enabled them to circle the north end of the sea, they might some day come upon the broken wreck of my plane hanging in the great tree to the south; but long before that, my bones would be added to the litter upon the floor of this mighty cavern.  And through all my thoughts, real and fanciful, moved the image of a perfect girl, clear-eyed and strong and straight and beautiful, with the carriage of a queen and the supple, undulating grace of a leopard. Though I loved my friends, their fate seemed of less importance to me than the fate of this little barbarian stranger for whom, I had convinced myself many a time, I felt no greater sentiment than passing friendship for a fellow-wayfarer in this land of horrors.  Yet I so worried and fretted about her and her future that at last I quite forgot my own predicament, though I still"]]]
