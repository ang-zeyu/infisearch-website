Ephum's face was working with excitement.  \"What's the matter with you, Ephum?\" asked the Colonel, kindly. \"You haven't been yourself lately.\"  \"No, Marsa, I ain't 'zactly.\"  Ephum put down the duster, peered out of the door of the private office, and closed it softly.  \"Marse Comyn?\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Marse Comyn, I ain't got no use fo' dat Misteh Hoppa', Ise kinder sup'stitious 'bout him, Marsa.\"  The Colonel put down his newspaper.  \"Has he treated you badly, Ephum?\" he asked quietly.  The faithful negro saw another question in his master's face. He well knew that Colonel Carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning the conduct of a superior.  \"Oh no, suh. And I ain't sayin' nuthin' gin his honesty. He straight, but he powerful sharp, Marse Comyn. An' he jus' mussiless down to a cent.\"  The Colonel sighed. He realized that which was beyond the grasp of the negro's mind. New and thriftier methods of trade from New England were fast replacing the old open-handedness of the large houses. Competition had begun, and competition is cruel. Edwards, James, & Company had taken a Yankee into the firm. They were now Edwards, James, & Doddington, and Mr. Edwards's coolness towards the Colonel was manifest since the rise of Eliphalet. They were rivals now instead of friends. But Colonel Carvel did not know until after years that Mr. Hopper had been offered the place which Mr. Doddington filled later.  As for Mr. Hopper, increase of salary had not changed him. He still lived in the same humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane's boarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had that first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel's store. He was superintendent, now, of Mr. Davitt's Sunday School, and a church officer. At night, when he came home from business, he would read the widow's evening paper, and the Colonel's morning paper at the office. Of true Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco. It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman's Bank began to point out Mr. Hopper's back to casual customers, and he was more than once seen to enter the president's room, which had carpet on the floor.  Eliphalet's suavity with certain delinquent customers from the Southwest was A wording to Scripture. When they were profane, and invited him into the street, he reminded them that the city had a police force and a jail. While still a young man, he had a manner of folding his hands and smiling which is peculiar to capitalists, and he knew the laws concerning mortgages in several different states.  But Eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which Providence had placed him, and so to be an example for many of us. He did not buy, or even hire, an evening suit. He was pleased to superintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before Virginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the stair-landing. There Mr. Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in conversation with the teller of the Boatman's Bank) chanced upon him. Mr. Cluyme was so charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted the rise and fall of sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr. Hopper to dinner. And from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society. If the Cluyme household was not polite, it was nothing. Eliphalet sat next to Miss Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he cherished for future use. Mrs. Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which (if the truth were told) needed an apology. All of which is significant, but sordid and uninteresting. Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before a rise.  There was only one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into prominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent. If, upon entering the ground-glass office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel, Captain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty. The inquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum. Once, when Mr. Hopper had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest Captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth Street, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast. The Captain sat down opposite.  \"Colonel,\" said he, without an introduction. \"I don't like this here business of letting Hopper run your store. He's a fish, I tell you.\"  The Colonel drank his coffee in silence.  \"Lige,\" he said gently, \"he's nearly doubled my income. It isn't the old times, when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in and year out. You know that.\"  The Captain took a deep draught of the coffee which Jackson had laid before him.  \"Colonel Carvel,\" he said emphatically, \"the fellow's a damned rascal, and will ruin you yet if you don't take advice.\"  The Colonel shifted uneasily.  \"The books show that he's honest, Lige.\"  \"Yes,\" cried Lige, with his fist on the table. \"Honest to a mill. But if that fellow ever gets on top of you, or any one else, he'll grind you into dust.\"  \"He isn't likely to get on top of me, Lige. I know the business, and keep watch. And now that Jinny's coming home from Monticello, I feel that I can pay more attention to her--kind of take her mother's place,\" said the Colonel, putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair. \"Lige, I want that girl to have every advantage. She ought to go to Europe and see the world. That trip East last summer did her a heap of good. When we were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had written about London, and she was regularly fired. First I must take her to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall. Dan still owns it. Now it's London and Paris.\"  The Captain walked over to the window, and said nothing. He did not see the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him.  \"Lige!\" said the Colonel.  The Captain turned.  \"Lige, why don't you give up steamboating and come along to Europe? You're not forty yet, and you have a heap of money laid by.\"  The Captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him.  \"This ain't no time for me to leave,\" he said. \"Colonel; I tell you there's a storm comin'.\"  The Colonel pulled his goatee uneasily. Here, at last, was a man in whom there was no guile.  \"Lige,\" he said, \"isn't it about time you got married?\"  Upon which the Captain shook his head again, even with more vigor. He could not trust himself to speak. After the Christmas holidays he had driven Virginia across the frozen river, all the way to Monticello, in a sleigh. It was night when they had reached the school, the light of its many windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees. He had helped her out, and had taken her hand as she stood on the step.  \"Be good, Jinny,\" he had said. \"Remember what a short time it will be until June. And your Pa will come over to see you.\"  She had seized him by the buttons of his great coat, and said tearfully: \"O Captain Lige! I shall be so lonely when you are away. Aren't you going to kiss me?\"  He had put his lips to her forehead, driven madly back to Alton, and spent the night. The first thing he did the next day when he reached St. Louis was to go straight to the Colonel and tell him bluntly of the circumstance.  \"Lige, I'd hate to give her up,\" Mr. Carvel said; \"but I'd rather you'd marry her than any man I can think of.\"     CHAPTER IX  SIGNS OF THE TIMES  In that spring of 1860 the time was come for the South to make her final stand. And as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground, Stephen Brice was not the only one who thought of the Question at Freeport. The hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit.  Meanwhile, his hero, the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech, Abraham Lincoln, had made a little tour eastward the year before, and had startled Cooper Union with a new logic and a new eloquence. They were the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled Stephen.  Even as he predicted who had given it birth, the Question destroyed the great Democratic Party. Colonel Carvel travelled to the convention in historic Charleston soberly and fearing God, as many another Southern gentleman. In old Saint Michael's they knelt to pray for harmony, for peace; for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them. All through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain. Judge Douglas, you flattered yourself that you had evaded the Question. Do you see the Southern delegates rising in their seats? Alabama leaves the hall, followed by her sister stakes. The South has not forgotten your Freeport Heresy. Once she loved you now she will have none of you.  Gloomily, indeed, did Colonel Carvel return home. He loved the Union and the flag for which his grandfather Richard had fought so bravely. That flag was his inheritance. So the Judge, laying his hand upon the knee of his friend, reminded him gravely. But the Colonel shook his head. The very calmness of their argument had been portentous.  \"No, Whipple,\" said he. \"You are a straightforward man. You can't disguise it. You of the North are bent upon taking away from us the rights we had when our fathers framed the Constitution. However the nigger got to this country, sir, in your Bristol and Newport traders, as well as in our Virginia and Maryland ships, he is here, and he was here when the Constitution was written. He is happier in slavery than are your factory hands in New England; and he is no more fit to exercise the solemn rights of citizenship, I say, than the halfbreeds in the South American states.\"  The Judge attempted to interrupt, but Mr. Carvel stopped him.  \"Suppose you deprive me of my few slaves, you do not ruin me. Yet you do me as great a wrong as you do my friend Samuels, of Louisiana, who depends on the labor of five hundred. Shall I stand by selfishly and see him ruined, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5391"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 04 (#3)"],["body","of others like him?\"  Profoundly depressed, Colonel Carvel did not attend the adjourned Convention at Baltimore, which split once more on Mason and Dixon's line. The Democrats of the young Northwest stood for Douglas and Johnson, and the solid South, in another hall, nominated Breckenridge and Lane. This, of course, became the Colonel's ticket.  What a Babel of voices was raised that summer! Each with its cure for existing ills. Between the extremes of the Black Republican Negro Worshippers and the Southern Rights party of Breckenridge, your conservative had the choice of two candidates,--of Judge Douglas or Senator Bell. A most respectable but practically extinct body of gentlemen in ruffled shirts, the Old Line Whigs, had likewise met in Baltimore. A new name being necessary, they called themselves Constitutional Unionists Senator Bell was their candidate, and they proposed to give the Nation soothing-syrup. So said Judge Whipple, with a grunt of contempt, to Mr. Cluyme, who was then a prominent Constitutional Unionist. Other and most estimable gentlemen were also Constitutional Unionists, notably Mr. Calvin Brinsmade. Far be it from any one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party, whose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren.  One Sunday evening in May, the Judge was taking tea with Mrs. Brice. The occasion was memorable for more than one event--which was that he addressed Stephen by his first name for the first time.  \"You're an admirer of Abraham Lincoln,\" he had said.  Stephen, used to Mr. Whipple's ways, smiled quietly at his mother. He had never dared mention to the Judge his suspicions concerning his journey to Springfield and Freeport.  \"Stephen,\" said the Judge (here the surprise came in), \"Stephen, what do you think of Mr. Lincoln's chances for the Republican nomination?\"  \"We hear of no name but Seward's, sir,\" said Stephen, When he had recovered.  The Judge grunted.  \"Do you think that Lincoln would make a good President?\" he added.  \"I have thought so, sir, ever since you were good enough to give me the opportunity of knowing him.\"  It was a bold speech--the Judge drew his great eyebrows together, but he spoke to Mrs. Brice.  \"I'm not as strong as I was once, ma'am,\" said he. \"And yet I am going to that Chicago convention.\"  Mrs. Brice remonstrated mildly, to the effect that he had done his share of political work. He scarcely waited for her to finish.  \"I shall take a younger man with me, in case anything happens. In fact, ma'am, I had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him.\"  And so it was that Stephen went to that most dramatic of political gatherings,--in the historic Wigwam. It was so that his eyes were opened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the Republic, --the political machine. Mr. Seward had brought his machine from New York, --a legion prepared to fill the Wigwam with their bodies, and to drown with their cries all names save that of their master.  Stephen indeed had his eyes opened. Through the kindness of Judge Whipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates from other states--Pennsylvania and Illinois and Indiana and elsewhere. He perceived that the Judge was no nonentity in this new party. Mr. Whipple sat in his own room, and the delegates came and ranged themselves along the bed. Late one night, when the delegates were gone, Stephen ventured to speak what was in his mind.  \"Mr. Lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man, sir; who would permit a bargain.\"  \"Mr. Lincoln's at home playing barn-ball,\" said the Judge, curtly. \"He doesn't expect the nomination.\"  \"Then,\" said Stephen, rather hotly, \"I think you are unfair to him.\"  You are expecting the Judge to thunder. Sometimes he liked this kind of speech.  \"Stephen, I hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become a delegate,\" he answered, with just the suspicion of a smile. \"Supposing you are convinced that Abraham Lincoln is the only man who can save the Union, and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet Seward's gang with their own methods, what would you do, sir? I want a practical proposition, sir,\" said Mr. Whipple, \"one that we can use to-night. It is now one 'clock.\"  As Stephen was silent, the Judge advised him to go to bed. And the next morning, while Mr. Seward's henchmen, confident and uproarious, were parading the streets of Chicago with their bands and their bunting, the vast Wigwam was quietly filling up with bony Westerners whose ally was none other than the state of Pennsylvania. These gentlemen possessed wind which they had not wasted in processions. And the Lord delivered Seward and all that was his into their hands.  How the light of Mr. Seward's hope went out after the first ballot, and how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept; and how the voices shook the Wigwam, and the thunder of the guns rolled over the tossing water of the lake, many now living remember. That day a name was delivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was destined to enter history that of the saviour of the Nation.  Down in little Springfield, on a vacant lot near the station, a tall man in his shirt sleeves was playing barn-ball with some boys. The game finished, he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under the tree--when a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram. The tall man read it, and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet taking long strides, Later in the day he was met by a friend.  \"Abe,\" said the friend, \"I'm almighty glad there somebody in this town's got notorious at last.\"  In the early morning of their return from Chicago Judge Whipple and Stephen were standing in the front of a ferry-boat crossing the Mississippi. The sun was behind them. The Judge had taken off his hat, and his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze. Illness had set a yellow seal on the face, but the younger man remarked it not. For Stephen, staring at the black blur of the city outline, was filled with a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his Puritan forefathers. Now at length was come his chance to be of use in life,--to dedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to Abraham Lincoln uncouth prophet of the West. With all his might he would work to save the city for the man who was the hope of the Union.  The bell rang. The great paddles scattered the brow waters with white foam, and the Judge voiced his thoughts.  \"Stephen,\" said he, \"I guess we'll have to put on shoulders to the wheel this summer. If Lincoln is not elected I have lived my sixty-five years for nothing.\"  As he descended the plank, he laid a hand on Stephen's arm, and tottered. The big Louisiana, Captain Brent's boat, just in from New Orleans, was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the levee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it. The clatter of hooves and the crack of whips reached their ears, and, like many others before them and since, they stepped into Carvel & Company's. On the inside of the glass partition of the private office, a voice of great suavity was heard. It was Eliphalet Hopper's.  \"If you will give me the numbers of the bales, Captain Brent, I'll send a dray down to your boat and get them.\"  It was a very decisive voice that answered.  \"No, sir, I prefer to do business with my friend, Colonel Carvel. I guess I can wait.\"  \"I could sell the goods to Texas buyers who are here in the store right now.\"  \"Until I get instructions from one of the concern,\" vowed Captain Lige, \"I shall do as I always have done, sir. What is your position here, Mr. Hopper?\"  \"I am manager, I callate.\"  The Captain's fist was heard to come down on the desk.  \"You don't manage me,\" he said, \"and I reckon you don't manage the Colonel.\"  Mr. Hopper's face was not pleasant to see as he emerged. But at sight of Judge Whipple on the steps his suavity returned.  \"The Colonel will be in any minute, sir,\" said he.  But the Judge walked past him without reply, and into the office. Captain Brent, seeing him; sprang to his feet.  \"Well, well, Judge,\" said he, heartily, \"you fellows have done it now, sure. I'll say this for you, you've picked a smart man.\"  \"Better vote for him, Lige,\" said the Judge, setting down.  The Captain smiled at Stephen.  \"A man's got a lot of choice this year;\" said he. \"Two governments, thirty-three governments, one government patched up for a year ox two.\"  \"Or no government,\" finished the Judge. \"Lige, you're not such a fool as to vote against the Union?\"  \"Judge,\" said the Captain, instantly, \"I'm not the only one in this town who will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong. My sympathies are with the South.\"  \"It's not a question of sympathy, Captain,\" answered the Judge, dryly. \"Abraham Lincoln himself was born in Kentucky.\"  They had not heard a step without.  \"Gentlemen, mark my words. If Abraham Lincoln is elected, the South leaves this Union.\"  The Judge started, and looked up. The speaker was Colonel Carvel himself.  \"Then, sir,\" Mr. Whipple cried hotly, \"then you will be chastised and brought back. For at last we have chosen a man who is strong enough, --who does not fear your fire-eaters,--whose electors depend on Northern votes alone.\"  Stephen rose apprehensively, So did Captain Lige The Colonel had taken a step forward, and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes. It was as quick to die. Judge Whipple, deathly pale, staggered and fell into Stephen' arms. But it was the Colonel who laid him on the horsehair sofa.  \"Silas!\" he said, \"Silas!\"  Nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the Colonel put into those two words.  But the Judge had not fainted. And the brusqueness in his weakened voice was even more pathetic-- \"Tut, tut,\" said he. \"A little heat, and no breakfast.\"  The Colonel already had a bottle of the famous Bourbon day his hand, and Captain Lige brought a glass of muddy iced water."]]]
