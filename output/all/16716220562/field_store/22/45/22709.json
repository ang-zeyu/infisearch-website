Where is Bischen, the captain of police?\"  Datis, the so-called \"eye of the king,\"  who held the office filled in modern days by a minister of police, hurried from the room, returning in a few minutes with the desired officer.  These moments Phanes made use of for putting various questions on important points to the nobles who were present.  \"What news can you bring of the prisoners?\"  asked the king, as the man lay prostrate before him.  \"Victory to the king!  They await death with calmness, for it is sweet to die by thy will.\"  \"Have you heard anything of their conversation?\"  \"Yes, my Ruler.\"  \"Do they acknowledge their guilt, when speaking to each other?\"  \"Mithras alone knows the heart; but you, my prince, if you could hear them speak, would believe in their innocence, even as I the humblest of your servants.\"  The captain looked up timidly at the king, fearing lest these words should have excited his anger; Cambyses, however, smiled kindly instead of rebuking him.  But a sudden thought darkened his brow again directly, and in a low voice he asked: \"When was Croesus executed?\"  The man trembled at this question; the perspiration stood on his forehead, and he could scarcely stammer the words: \"He is.... he has.... we thought....\"  \"What did you think?\"  interrupted Cambyses, and a new light of hope seemed to dawn in his mind.  \"Is it possible, that you did not carry out my orders at once?  Can Croesus still be alive?  Speak at once, I must know the whole truth.\"  The captain writhed like a worm at his lord's feet, and at last stammered out, raising his hands imploringly towards the king: \"Have mercy, have mercy, my Lord the king!  I am a poor man, and have thirty children, fifteen of whom .  .  .\"  \"I wish to know if Croesus is living or dead.\"  \"He is alive!  He has done so much for me, and I did not think I was doing wrong in allowing him to live a few hours longer, that he might...\"  \"That is enough,\" said the king breathing freely.  \"This once your disobedience shall go unpunished, and the treasurer may give you two talents, as you have so many children.--Now go to the prisoners,--tell Croesus to come hither, and the others to be of good courage, if they are innocent.\"  \"My King is the light of the world, and an ocean of mercy.\"  \"Bartja and his friends need not remain any longer in confinement; they can walk in the court of the palace, and you will keep guard over them. You, Datis, go at once to the hanging-gardens and order Boges to defer the execution of the sentence on the Egyptian Princess; and further, I wish messengers sent to the post-station mentioned by the Athenian, and the wounded man brought hither under safe escort.\"  The \" king's eye \" was on the point of departure, but Phanes detained him, saying: \"Does my King allow me to make one remark?\"  \"Speak.\"  \"It appears to me, that the chief of the eunuchs could give the most accurate information.  During his delirium the youth often mentioned his name in connection with that of the girl he seemed to be in love with.\"  \"Go at once, Datis, and bring him quickly.\"  \"The high-priest  Oropastes, Gaumata's  brother, ought to appear too; and Mandane, whom I have just been assured on the most positive authority, is the principal attendant of the Egyptian Princess.\"  \"Fetch her, Datis.\"  \"If Nitetis herself could .  .  .\"  At this the king turned pale and a cold shiver ran through his limbs. How he longed to see his darling again!  But the strong man was afraid of this woman's reproachful looks; he knew the captivating power that lay in her eyes.  So he pointed to the door, saying \"Fetch Boges and Mandane; the Egyptian Princess is to remain in the hanging-gardens, under strict custody.\"  The Athenian bowed deferentially; as if he would say: \"Here no one has a right to command but the king.\"  Cambyses looked well pleased, seated himself again on the purple divan, and resting his forehead on his hand, bent his eyes on the ground and sank into deep thought.  The picture of the woman he loved so dearly refused to be banished; it came again and again, more and more vividly, and the thought that these features could not have deceived him--that Nitetis must be innocent--took a firmer root in his mind; he had already begun to hope.  If Bartja could be cleared, there was no error that might not be conceivable; in that case he would go to the hanging-gardens, take her hand and listen to her defence.  When love has once taken firm hold of a man in riper years, it runs and winds through his whole nature like one of his veins, and can only be destroyed with his life.  The entrance of Croesus roused Cambyses from his dream; he raised the old man kindly from the prostrate position at his feet, into which he had thrown himself on entering, and said: \"You offended me, but I will be merciful; I have not forgotten that my father, on his dying bed, told me to make you my friend and adviser.  Take your life back as a gift from me, and forget my anger as I wish to forget your want of reverence.  This man says he knows you; I should like to hear your opinion of his conjectures.\"  Croesus turned away much affected, and after having heartily welcomed the Athenian, asked him to relate his suppositions and the grounds on which they were founded.  The old man grew more and more attentive as the Greek went on, and when he had finished raised his hands to heaven, crying: \"Pardon me, oh ye eternal gods, if I have ever questioned the justice of your decrees.  Is not this marvellous, Cambyses?  My son once placed himself in great danger to save the life of this noble Athenian, whom the gods have brought hither to repay the deed tenfold.  Had Phanes been murdered in Egypt, this hour might have seen our sons executed.\"  And as he said this he embraced Hystaspes; both shared one feeling; their sons had been as dead and were now alive.  The king, Phanes, and all the Persian dignitaries watched the old men with deep sympathy, and though the proofs of Bartja's innocence were as yet only founded on conjecture, not one of those present doubted it one moment longer.  Wherever the belief in a man's guilt is but slight, his defender finds willing listeners.     CHAPTER VI.  THE sharp-witted Athenian saw clearly how matters lay in this sad story; nor did it escape him that malice had had a hand in the affair.  How could Bartja's dagger have come into the hanging-gardens except through treachery?  While he was telling the king his suspicions, Oropastes was led into the hall.  The king looked angrily at him and without one preliminary word, asked: \"Have you a brother?\"  \"Yes, my King.  He and I are the only two left out of a family of six. My parents .  .  .\"  \"Is your brother younger or older than yourself?\"  \"I was the eldest of the family; my brother, the youngest, was the joy of my father's old age.\"  \"Did you ever notice a remarkable likeness between him and one of my relations?\"  \"Yes, my King.  Gaumata is so like your brother Bartja, that in the school for priests at Rhagae, where he still is, he was always called \"the prince.\"  \"Has he been at Babylon very lately?\"  \"He was here for the last time at the New Year's festival.\"  \"Are you speaking the truth?\"  \"The sin of lying would be doubly punishable in one who wears my robes, and holds my office.\"  The king's face flushed with anger at this answer and he exclaimed: \"Nevertheless  you  are lying; Gaumata was here yesterday evening.  You may well tremble.\"  \"My life belongs to the king, whose are all things; nevertheless I swear --the high-priest-by the most high God, whom I have served faithfully for thirty years, that I know nothing of my brother's presence in Babylon yesterday.\"  \"Your face looks as if you were speaking the truth.\"  \"You know that I was not absent from your side the whole of that high holiday.\"  \"I know it.\"  Again the doors opened; this time they admitted the trembling Mandane. The high-priest cast such a look of astonishment and enquiry on her, that the king saw she must be in some way connected with him, and therefore, taking no notice of the trembling girl who lay  at his  feet,  he asked: \"Do  you  know  this woman?\"  \"Yes, my King.  I obtained for her the situation of upper attendant to the--may Auramazda forgive her!--King of Egypt's daughter.\"  \"What led you,--a priest,--to do a favor to this girl?\"  \"Her parents died of the same pestilence, which carried off my brothers. Her father was a priest, respected, and a friend of our family; so we adopted the little girl, remembering the words: 'If thou withhold help from the man who is pure in heart and from his widow and orphans, then shall the pure, subject earth cast thee out unto the stinging-nettles, to painful sufferings and to the most fearful regions!'  Thus I became her foster-father, and had her brought up with my youngest brother until he was obliged to enter the school for priests.\"  The king exchanged a look of intelligence with Phanes, and asked: \"Why did not you keep the girl longer with you?\"  \"When she had received the ear-rings I, as priest, thought it more suitable to send such a young girl away from my house, and to put her in a position to earn her own living.\"  \"Has she seen your brother since she has been grown up?\"  \"Yes, my King.  Whenever Gaumata came to see me I allowed him to be with her as with a sister; but on discovering later that the passionate love of youth had begun to mingle with the childish friendship of former days, I felt strengthened in my resolution to send her away.\"  \"Now we know enough,\" said the king, commanding the high-priest by a nod to retire. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5456"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 07 (#4)"],["body"," He then looked down on the prostrate girl, and said imperiously: \"Rise!\"  Mandane rose, trembling with fear.  Her fresh young face was pale as death, and her red lips were blue from terror.  \"Tell all you know about yesterday evening; but remember, a lie and your death are one and the same.\"  The girl's knees trembled so violently that she could hardly stand, and her fear entirely took away the power of speaking.  \"I have not much patience,\" exclaimed Cambyses.  Mandane started, grew paler still, but could not speak.  Then Phanes came forward and asked the angry king to allow him to examine the girl, as he felt sure that fear alone had closed her lips and that a kind word would open them.  Cambyses allowed this, and the Athenian's words proved true; no sooner had he assured Mandane of the good-will of all present, laid his hand on her head and spoken kindly to her, than the source of her tears was unlocked, she wept freely, the spell which had seemed to chain her tongue, vanished, and she began to tell her story, interrupted only by low sobs.  She hid nothing, confessed that Boges had given her his sanction and assistance to the meeting with Gaumata, and ended by saying: \"I know that I have forfeited my life, and am the worst and most ungrateful creature in the world; but none of all this would have happened, if Oropastes had allowed his brother to marry me.\"  The serious audience, even the king himself, could not resist a smile at the longing tone in which these words were spoken and the fresh burst of sobs which succeeded them.  And this smile saved her life.  But Cambyses would not have smiled, after hearing such a story, if Mandane, with that instinct which always seems to stand at a woman's command in the hour of her greatest danger, had not known how to seize his weak side, and use it for her own interests, by dwelling much longer than was necessary, on the delight which Nitetis had manifested at the king's gifts.  \"A thousand times\" cried she, \"did my mistress kiss the presents which were brought from you, O King; but oftenest of all did she press her lips to the nosegay which you plucked with your own hands for her, some days ago.  And when it began to fade, she took every flower separately, spread out the petals with care, laid them between woollen cloths, and, with her own hands, placed her heavy, golden ointment-box upon them, that they might dry and so she might keep them always as a remembrance of your kindness.\"  Seeing Cambyses' awful features grow a little milder at these words, the girl took fresh courage, and at last began to put loving words into her mistress's mouth which the latter had never uttered; professing that she herself had heard Nitetis a hundred times murmur the word \"Cambyses\" in her sleep with indescribable tenderness.  She ended her confession by sobbing and praying for mercy.  The king looked down at her with infinite contempt, though without anger, and pushing her away with his foot said: \"Out of my sight, you dog of a woman!  Blood like yours would soil the executioner's axe.  Out of my sight!\"  Mandane needed no second command to depart.  The words \"out of my sight\" sounded like sweet music in her ears.  She rushed through the courts of the palace, and out into the streets, crying like a mad woman \"I am free! I am free!\"  She, had scarcely left the hall, when Datis, the \"king's eye\" reappeared with the news that the chief of the eunuchs was nowhere to be found.  He had vanished from the hanging-gardens in an unaccountable manner; but he, Datis, had left word with his subordinates that he was to be searched for and brought, dead or alive.  The king went off into another violent fit of passion at this news, and threatened the officer of police, who prudently concealed the excitement of the crowd from his lord, with a severe punishment, if Boges were not in their hands by the next morning.  As he finished speaking, a eunuch was brought into the hall, sent by the king's mother to ask an interview for herself with her son.  Cambyses prepared at once to comply with his mother's wish, at the same time giving Phanes his hand to kiss, a rare honor, only shown to those that ate at the king's table, and saying: \"All the prisoners are to be set at liberty.  Go to your sons, you anxious, troubled fathers, and assure them of my mercy and favor.  I think we shall be able to find a satrapy a-piece for them, as compensation for to-night's undeserved imprisonment.  To you, my Greek friend, I am deeply indebted.  In discharge of this debt, and as a means of retaining you at my court, I beg you to accept one hundred talents from my treasury.\"  \"I shall scarcely be able to use so large a sum,\" said Phanes, bowing low.  \"Then abuse it,\" said the king with a friendly smile, and calling out to him, \"We shall meet again at supper,\" he left the hall accompanied by his court.                      ........................  In the meantime there had been sadness and mourning in the apartments of the queen-mother.  Judging from the contents of the letter to Bartja, Kassandane had made up her mind that Nitetis was faithless, and her own beloved son innocent.  But in whom could she ever place confidence again, now that this girl, whom she had looked upon as the very embodiment of every womanly virtue, had proved reprobate and faithless--now that the noblest youths in the realm had proved perjurers?  Nitetis was more than dead for her; Bartja, Croesus, Darius, Gyges, Araspes, all so closely allied to her by relationship and friendship, as good as dead.  And yet she durst not indulge her sorrow; she had to restrain the despairing outbursts of grief of her impetuous child.  Atossa behaved like one deprived of her senses when she heard of the sentences of death.  The self-control which she had learnt from Nitetis gave way, and her old impetuosity burst forth again with double vehemence.  Nitetis, her only friend,--Bartja, the brother whom she loved with her whole heart,--Darius, whom she felt now she not only looked up to as her deliverer, but loved with all the warmth of a first affection--Croesus to whom she clung like a father,--she was to lose every one she loved in one day.  She tore her dress and her hair, called Cambyses a monster, and every one who could possibly believe in the guilt of such people, infatuated or insane.  Then her tears would burst out afresh, she would utter imploring supplications to the gods for mercy, and a few minutes later, begin conjuring her mother to take her to the hanging-gardens, that they might hear Nitetis' defence of her own conduct.  Kassandane tried to soothe the violent girl, and assured her every attempt to visit the hanging-gardens would be in vain.  Then Atossa began to rage again, until at last her mother was forced to command silence, and as morning had already began to dawn, sent her to her sleeping-room.  The girl obeyed, but instead of going to bed, seated herself at a tall window looking towards the hanging-gardens.  Her eyes filled with tears again, as she thought of her friend--her sister-sitting in that palace alone, forsaken, banished, and looking forward to an ignominious death. Suddenly her tearful, weary eyes lighted up as if from some strong purpose, and instead of gazing into the distance, she fixed them on a black speck which flew towards her in a straight line from Nitetis' house, becoming larger and more distinct every moment; and finally settling on a cypress before her window.  The sorrow vanished at once from her lovely face and with a deep sigh of relief she sprang up, exclaiming:  \"Oh, there is the Homai, the bird of good fortune!  Now everything will turn out well.\"  It was the same bird of paradise which had brought so much comfort to Nitetis that now gave poor Atossa fresh confidence.  She bent forward to see whether any one was in the garden; and finding that she would be seen by no one but the old gardener, she jumped out, trembling like a fawn, plucked a few roses and cypress twigs and took them to the old man, who had been watching her performances with a doubtful shake of the head.  She stroked his cheeks coaxingly, put her flowers in his brown hand, and said: \"Do you love me, Sabaces?\"  \"O, my mistress!\"  was the only answer the old man could utter, as he pressed the hem of her robe to his lips.  \"I believe you, my old friend, and I will show you how I trust my faithful, old Sabaces.  Hide these flowers carefully and go quickly to the king's palace.  Say that you had to bring fruit for the table.  My poor brother Bartja, and Darius, the son of the noble Hystaspes, are in prison, near the guard-house of the Immortals.  You must manage that these flowers reach them, with a warm greeting from me, but mind, the message must be given with the flowers.\"  \"But the guards will not allow me to see the prisoners.\"  \"Take these rings, and slip them into their hands.\"  \"I will do my best.\"  \"I knew you loved me, my good Sabaces.  Now make haste, and come back soon.\"  The old man went off as fast as he could.  Atossa looked thoughtfully after him, murmuring to herself: \"Now they will both know, that I loved them to the last.  The rose means, 'I love you,' and the evergreen cypress, 'true and steadfast.'\"  The old man came back in an hour; bringing her Bartja's favorite ring, and from Darius an Indian handkerchief dipped in blood.  Atossa ran to meet him; her eyes filled with tears as she took the tokens, and seating herself under a spreading plane-tree, she pressed them by turns to her lips, murmuring: \"Bartja's ring means that he thinks of me; the blood-stained handkerchief that Darius is ready to shed his heart's blood for me.\"  Atossa smiled as she said this, and her tears, when she thought of her friends and their sad fate, were quieter, if not less bitter, than before.  A few hours later a messenger arrived from Croesus with news that the innocence of Bartja and his friends had been proved, and that Nitetis was, to all intents and"]]]
