Standing motionless, he strove for words, while his eyes revealed plainly enough the passionate rapture which agitated his soul.  Barbara perceived what was passing in his thoughts, and also noticed how her dress had become disarranged during her work.  Flushing slightly, she pursed up her lips as if to whistle, and with her head thrust forward she blew into the air in his direction.  Then, shaking her finger at him, she hastily sat down on the chest beside the fireplace, wound the kerchief which had fallen off closer around her neck, and, without the least embarrassment, pulled up her stockings.  \"What does it matter!\" she cried with a slight shrug of the shoulders. \"How often we two have waded together in water above our knees, like the storks!  And yet such a thing turns the head of a youth who has returned from foreign lands a made man, and closes his bearded lips!  Have you given me even a single honest word of welcome?  That's the way with all of you!  And you?  If you stand there already like a dumb sign-post, how will it be when I thoroughly turn your head like all the rest with my singing?\"  \"I've heard you already!\" he answered quickly; \"magical, bewildering, magnificent!  Who in the world wrought this miracle with your voice?\"  \"There we have it!\" she cried, laughing merrily and clapping her hands. \"To make you speak, one need only allude distantly to music.  That, too, has remained unchanged, and I am glad, for I have much to ask you in relation to it.  I can learn many things from you still.  But what have you there in your hand?  Is it anything pretty from Brabant?\" This question flowed from her lips with coaxing tenderness, and she passed her soft hand swiftly over his cheek.  How happy it made him!  Hitherto he had been the receiver--nay, an unfair taker--but now he was to become the giver and she would be pleased with his present.  As if relieved from a nightmare, he now told her that he had gone from Rome, through the Papal Legate Contarini, whom he had accompanied to Italy as a secretary skilled in German and music--to the imperial court, where he now enjoyed the special favour of the Regent of the Netherlands, the widowed Queen of Hungary; that the royal lady, the sister of the Emperor Charles, had chosen him to be director of her lessons in singing, and also permitted him to write German letters for her; and what assistance worthy of all gratitude he had enjoyed through the director of the imperial musicians, Gombert, the composer and leader of the royal orchestra, and his colleague Appenzelder, who directed the Queen's boy choir.  At the mention of these names, Barbara listened intently.  She had sung several of Gombert's compositions, and was familiar with one of Appenzelder's works.  When she learned that both must have arrived in Ratisbon several hours before, she anxiously asked Wolf if he would venture to make her acquainted with these great masters.  Wolf assented with joyous eagerness, while Barbara's cheeks crimsoned with pleasure at so valuable a promise.  Yet this subject speedily came to a close, for while talking Wolf had ripped the linen cover in which the roll of velvet was sewed, and, as soon as he unfolded the rich wine-coloured material, Barbara forgot everything else, and burst into loud exclamations of pleasure and admiration.  Then, when Wolf hastened out and with hurrying fingers opened the little package he had brought and gave her the costly fur which was to serve as trimming for the velvet jacket, she again laughed gleefully, and, ere Wolf was aware of it, she had thrown her arms around his neck and kissed him on both cheeks.  He submitted as if dazed, and did not even regain his senses sufficiently to profit by what she had granted him with such unexpected liberality. Nor did she allow him to speak as she loosed her arms from his neck, for, with a bewitching light in her large, blue eyes, fairly overflowing with grateful tenderness, she cried:  \"You dear, dear, kind little Wolf!  To think that you should have remembered me so generously!  And how rich you must be!  If I had become so before you, I should have given myself a dress exactly like this.  Now it's mine, just as though it had dropped from the sky.  Wine-coloured Flanders velvet, with a border of dark-brown marten fur!  I'll parade in it like the Duchess of Bavaria or rich Frau Fugger.  Holy Virgin! if that isn't becoming to my golden hair!  Doesn't it just suit me, you little Wolf and great spendthrift?  And when I wear it at the dance in the New Scale or sing in it at the Convivium musicum, my Woller cousins and the Thun girl will turn yellow with envy.\"  Wolf had only half listened to this outburst of delight, for he had reserved until the last his best offering--a sky-blue turquoise breastpin set with small diamonds.  It brought him enthusiastic thanks, and Barbara even allowed him to fasten the magnificent ornament with his own fingers, which moved slowly and clumsily enough.  Then she hurried into her chamber to bring the hand-mirror, and when in an instant she returned and, at her bidding, he held the shining glass before her, she patted his cheeks with their thin, fair, pointed beard, and called him her faithful little Wolf, her clear, stupid pedant and Satan in person, who would fill her mind with vanity.  Finally, she laid the piece of velvet over the back of a chair, let it fall down to the floor, and threw the bands of fur upon it.  Every graver word, every attempt to tell her what he expected from her, the girl cut short with expressions of gratitude and pleasure until her father returned from the suffering Ursel.  Then, radiant with joy, she showed the old man her new treasures, and the father's admiration and expressions of gratitude were not far behind the daughter's.  It seemed as though Fate had blessed the modest rooms in Red Cock Street with its most precious treasures.  It might be either Wolf's return, the hopes for his daughter which were associated with it in the crippled old warrior's heart, or the unexpected costly gifts, to which Wolf had added for his old friend a Netherland drinking vessel in the form of a silver ship, which had moved the old gentleman so deeply, but at any rate he allowed himself to be tempted into an act of extravagance, and, in an outburst of good spirits which he had not felt for a long time, he promised Wolf to fetch from the cellar one of the jugs of wine which he kept there for his daughter's wedding.  \"Over this liquid we will open our hearts freely to each other, my boy,\" he said.  \"The night is still long, and even at the Emperor's court there is nothing better to be tasted.  My dead mother used to say that there are always more good things in a poor family which was once rich than in a rich one which was formerly poor.\"     CHAPTER V.  The captain limped out into the cellar, but Barbara was already standing behind the table again, moving the irons.  \"When I am rich,\" she exclaimed, in reply to Wolf, who asked her to stop her work in this happy hour and share the delicious wine with him and her father, \"I shall shun such maid-servant's business.  But what else can be done?  We have less money than we need to keep up our position, and that must be remedied.  Besides, a neatly crimped ruff is necessary if a poor girl like me is to stand beside the others in the singing rehearsal early to-morrow morning.  Poor folks are alike everywhere, and, so long as I can do no better--but luck will come to me, too, some day--this right hand must be my maid.  Let it alone, or my iron will burn your fingers!\"  This threat was very nearly fulfilled, for Wolf had caught her right hand to hold it firmly while he at last compelled her to hear that his future destiny depended upon her decision.  How much easier he had expected to find the wooing!  Yet how could it be otherwise?  Every young man in Ratisbon was probably courting this peerless creature.  No doubt she had already rebuffed many another as sharply as she had just prevented him from seizing her hand.  If her manner had grown more independent, she had learned to defend herself cleverly.  He would first try to assail her heart with words, and they were at his disposal in black and white.  He had placed in the little box with the breastpin a piece of paper on which he had given expression to his feelings in verse.  Hitherto it had remained unnoticed and fluttered to the ground.  Picking it up, he introduced his suit, after a brief explanation, by reading aloud the lines which he had composed in Brussels to accompany his gifts to her.  It was an easy task, for he had painted rather than written his poetic homage, with beautiful ornaments on the initial letters, and in the most careful red and black Gothic characters, which looked like print.  So, with a vivacity of intonation which harmonized with the extravagance of the poetry, he began:                \"Queen of my heart wert thou in days of old,                Beloved maid, in childhood's garb so plain;                I bring thee velvet now, and silk and gold                Though I am but a poor and simple swain                That in robes worthy of thee may be seen                My sovereign, of all thy sex the queen.\"  Barbara nodded pleasantly to him, saying: \"Very pretty.  Perhaps you might arrange your little verse in a duo, but how you must have taxed your imagination, you poor fellow, to transform the flighty good-for- nothing whom you left five years ago into a brilliant queen!\"  \"Because, even at that time,\" he ardently exclaimed.  \"I had placed you on the throne of my heart, because the bud already promised--Yet no!  In those days I could not suspect that it would unfold into so marvellous a rose.  You stand before me now more glorious than I beheld you in the most radiant of all my dreams, and therefore the longing to possess you, which I could never relinquish, will make me appear"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5562"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 02 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      BARBARA BLOMBERG  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.    CHAPTER VI.  The old captain blew the dust from the wine flagon and carefully removed the seal.  His presence prevented Wolf from renewing the interrupted conversation.  Reflection doubtless warned him that it would be a dangerous venture to enter the same life-boat with this woman, yet how bewitchingly beautiful she had seemed to him in her proud superiority, in the agitation of soul aroused by the yearning for a fairer fate!  Have her he must, even though he was permitted to call her his own but for a year, a month, an hour.  Many of her words had been harsh and apparently unfeeling, yet how noble must be the soul of this young creature who, for the sake of being loyal to truth, the pure source of everything grand and lofty, paid no heed to much that is usually sacred to human beings!  But Barbara's conduct during the next hour appeared to belie this opinion of the man who loved her, for scarcely had her father sat down with the knight before the venerable wine flagon than she flung down the smoothing iron, hastily piled the finished articles one above another, and then, without heeding the parchment on which Wolf's verses were written, rolled up the ruby velvet.  Directly after, with the package under her arm, she wished the men a merry drinking bout, and added that poor Ursel might need her.  Besides, she wanted to show her the beautiful material, which would please the faithful soul.  Then, without even pausing at the rooms in the second story, she hurried swiftly down the stairs into the street.  She was carrying Wolf's gift to Frau Lerch, her dressmaker.  The Grieb, where the latter lived as wife of the keeper of the house, was only a few steps distant.  If the skilful woman, who was indebted to her for many a customer, began the work of cutting at once, her cousins, the Wollers, could help her the next day with the sewing.  True, these were the very girls who would \"turn yellow with rage\" at the sight of the velvet, but precisely because these rich girls had so many things of which she was deprived she felt that, in asking their aid, she was compelling Fate to atone for an injustice.  Haste was necessary for, at the first glance at the velvet, she had determined to wear it at the next dance in the New Scales, and she also saw distinctly in imagination the person whose attention she desired to attract.  True, the recruiting officer sent to Ratisbon, of whom she was thinking, was by no means a more acceptable suitor, but a handsome fellow, a scion of a noble family, and, above all, an excellent dancer.  She did not love him--nay, she was not even captivated by him like so many others.  But, if his heart throbbed faster for any one, it was Barbara.  Yet perhaps his glances strayed almost as frequently to one other maiden.  The velvet gown should now decide whether he gave the preference to her or to pretty Elspet Zohrer--of course, only in the dance--for she would never have accepted him as a serious suitor.  Besides, the young noble, Pyramus Kogel, himself probably thought of no such folly.  It was very different with Wolf Hartschwert.  She had been told the small amount of his inheritance long before, and on that account she would have been obliged to refuse him positively at once, yet the affectionate relations existing between them must not be clouded.  He might still become very useful to her and, besides, the modest companion of her childhood was dear to her.  She would have sincerely regretted an irreparable breach with him.  Her father indulged her in every respect, only he strictly forbade his beautiful child to leave the house alone after sunset.  Therefore Barbara had not told him the real object of her visit.  She now had no occasion to fear his following her.  Yet she made all possible haste, and, as she found Frau Lerch at home, and the skilful little woman was instantly at her service, she crowded into the space of an hour the many points about the cutting which were to be discussed.  Then she set out on her way home, expecting to traverse the short distance swiftly and without delay; but, when she had gone only a few paces from the Grieb, a tall man came toward her.  To avoid him she crossed nimbly to the other side of the dark little street, but just where it turned into Red Cock Street he suddenly barred her way.  She was startled, but the oft-proved courage of the Blomberg race, to which she had just alluded, really did animate her, and, with stern decision, she ordered her persecutor to stand aside.  He, however, was not to be intimidated, but exclaimed as joyously as though some great piece of good fortune had befallen him:  \"Thanks for accosting me, Jungfrau Barbara, for, though the words are harsh, they prove that, in spite of the darkness here, my eyes did not deceive me.  Heaven be praised!\"  Then the girl recognised the recruiting officer and excellent dancer of whom she had just been thinking in connection with the velvet upper robe, and answered sharply:  \"Certainly it is I; but if you are really a nobleman, Sir Pyramus, take care that I am not exposed by your fault to evil gossip, and can not continue to hold my head erect as I now do.\"  \"Who will see us in this little dark street?\"  he asked in low, persuasive tones.  \"May all the saints guard me from assailing the honour of a modest maiden, fairest Barbara; yet, if you fear that I might prevent your remaining in the future what the favour of the Most High permits you to be, I shall rather accuse you of having inflicted upon me what you fear may befall you; for, since the last dance, I am really no longer myself, and can never become so until I have received from your beautiful lips the modest consolation for which this poor, tortured, loyal soul is yearning.  May I not linger at your side long enough to ask you one question, you severe yet ardently beloved maiden?\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied Barbara with repellent harshness.  \"I never gave you a right to speak to me of love; but, above all, I shall not seek the sharer of a game of question and answer in the street.\"  \"Then name a place,\" he whispered with passionate ardour, trying meanwhile to clasp her hand, \"where I may be permitted, in broad sunlight and before the eyes of the whole world, to say to you what robs me of rest by day and sleep by night.  Drop the cruel harshness which so strangely and painfully contradicts the language of your glances the evening of the last dance.  Your eyes have kindled these flames, and this poor heart will consume in their glow if I am not suffered to confess to you that I love you with more ardour than was ever bestowed on any maiden.  This place--I will admit that it is ill-chosen--but what other was open to me?  After all, here, too, a bit of the sky with its many stars is looking down upon us.  But, if you still unkindly refuse me, or the dread of crossing the barrier of strict decorum forbids you to listen to me here, you can mercifully name another spot.  Allow me to go to your father and beg him for the clear hand which, in a happier hour, by not resisting the pressure of mine, awakened the fairest hopes in my heart.\"  \"This is too much,\" Barbara indignantly broke in.  \"Make way for me at once, and, if you are well advised, you will spare yourself the visit to my father; for, even if you were in earnest with your love and came as an honest suitor to our modest house, it might easily happen that you would descend the staircase, which is very steep and narrow, in as sorrowful a mood as you climbed it secure of victory.\"  Then Pyramus Kogel changed his tone, and said bitterly:  \"So your victorious eyes were only carrying on an idle game with my unsuspecting heart?  You laugh!  But I expected to find in my German native land only girls whose chaste reserve and simple honesty could be trusted.  It would be a great sorrow if I should learn through you, Jungfrau Barbara, that here, too, it would have been advisable to arm myself against wanton deception.  True, the French chansons you sing sound unlike our sincere German songs.  And then you, the fairest of the fair, can choose at will among men; but the Emperor's service carries me from one country to another.  I am only a poor nobleman--\"  \"I care not,\" she interrupted him here with icy coldness; \"you might be just good enough for the daughter of another nobleman, who has little more to call his own than you, Sir Knight, but nevertheless far too little for me to grant you permission to load me with unjust reproaches. Besides, you wholly lack the one advantage which the man to whom I am willing to betroth myself must possess.\"  \"And what is that?\"  he asked eagerly.  \"Neither gold nor lands, rank nor splendour,\" she answered proudly, \"but changeless fidelity of the heart.  Remember your fluttering from lovely Elspet Zohrer to me, and from me to Elspet, Sir Pyramus, and ask yourself what reason you would give me to expect the fulfilment of such a demand. Your fine figure and gay manner please us girls very well at a dance, but, though you should possess the wealth of the Fuggers and the power of the Sultan, it would be useless trouble to seek my consent.  Stand out of my path at once!  There come the Emperor's body guards, and, if you do not obey me, as surely as I hope for salvation I will call them!\"  The last words had escaped her lips in a raised voice, and vibrated with such honest indignation that the recruiting officer yielded; but a triumphant smile flitted over her beautiful face.  Had she known before how complete a victory he had already won over pretty Elspet Zohrer, her most dangerous rival, this late errand would have been unnecessary.  Yet she did not regret it; true, she cared no more "]]]
