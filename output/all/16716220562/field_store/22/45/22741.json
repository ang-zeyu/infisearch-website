He is a pretty boy, and pretty Chloes lover besides--she will look for him in vain this morning.\"  \"And to-morrow too perhaps,\" answered another; \"for if the fat king sees her, poor Damon will have seen the last of her.\"  But the fat king, as Euergetes was called by the Alexandrians, and, following their example, by all the rest of Egypt, was not just then thinking of Chloe, nor of any such person; he was in the bath attached to his splendidly fitted residence.  Divested of all clothing, he was standing in the tepid fluid which completely filled a huge basin of white marble.  The clear surface of the perfumed water mirrored statues of nymphs fleeing from the pursuit of satyrs, and reflected the shimmering light of numbers of lamps suspended from the ceiling.  At the upper end of the bath reclined the bearded and stalwart statue of the Nile, over whom the sixteen infant figures--representing the number of ells to which the great Egyptian stream must rise to secure a favorable inundation-- clambered and played to the delight of their noble father Nile and of themselves.  From the vase which supported the arm of the venerable god flowed an abundant stream of cold water, which five pretty lads received in slender alabaster vases, and poured over the head and the enormously prominent muscles of the breast, the back and the arms of the young king who was taking his bath.  \"More, more--again and again,\" cried Euergetes, as the boys began to pause in bringing and pouring the water; and then, when they threw a fresh stream over him, he snorted and plunged with satisfaction, and a perfect shower of jets splashed off him as the blast of his breath sputtered away the water that fell over his face.  At last he shouted out: \"Enough!\"  flung himself with all his force into the water, that spurted up as if a huge block of stone had been thrown into it, held his head for a long time under water, and then went up the marble steps of the bath shaking his head violently and mischievously in his boyish insolence, so as thoroughly to wet his friends and servants who were standing round the margin of the basin; he suffered himself to be wrapped in snowy-white sheets of the thinnest and finest linen, to be sprinkled with costly essences of delicate odor, and then he withdrew into a small room hung all round with gaudy hangings.  There he flung himself on a mound of soft cushions, and said with a deep- drawn breath: \"Now I am happy; and I am as sober again as a baby that has never tasted anything but its mother's milk.  Pindar is right! there is nothing better than water! and it slakes that raging fire which wine lights up in our brain and blood.  Did I talk much nonsense just now, Hierax?\"  The man thus addressed, the commander-in-chief of the royal troops, and the king's particular friend, cast a hesitating glance at the bystanders; but, Euergetes desiring him to speak without reserve, he replied:  \"Wine never weakens the mind of such as you are to the point of folly, but you were imprudent.  It would be little short of a miracle if Philometor did not remark--\"  \"Capital!\" interrupted the king sitting up on his cushions.  \"You, Hierax, and you, Komanus, remain here--you others may go.  But do not go too far off, so as to be close at hand in case I should need you.  In these days as much happens in a few hours as usually takes place in as many years.\"  Those who were thus dismissed withdrew, only the king's dresser, a Macedonian of rank, paused doubtfully at the door, but Euergetes signed to him to retire immediately, calling after him:  \"I am very merry and shall not go to bed.  At three hours after sunrise I expect Aristarchus--and for work too.  Put out the manuscripts that I brought.  Is the Eunuch Eulaeus waiting in the anteroom?  Yes--so much the better!  \"Now we are alone, my wise friends Hierax and Komanus, and I must explain to you that on this occasion, out of pure prudence, you seem to me to have been anything rather than prudent.  To be prudent is to have the command of a wide circle of thought, so that what is close at hand is no more an obstacle than what is remote.  The narrow mind can command only that which lies close under observation; the fool and visionary only that which is far off.  I will not blame you, for even the wisest has his hours of folly, but on this occasion you have certainly overlooked that which is at hand, in gazing at the distance, and I see you stumble in consequence.  If you had not fallen into that error you would hardly have looked so bewildered when, just now, I exclaimed 'Capital!'  \"Now, attend to me.  Philometor and my sister know very well what my humor is, and what to expect of me.  If I had put on the mask of a satisfied man they would have been surprised, and have scented mischief, but as it was I showed myself to them exactly what I always am and even more reckless than usual, and talked of what I wanted so openly that they may indeed look forward to some deed of violence at my hands but hardly to a treacherous surprise, and that tomorrow; for he who falls on his enemy in the rear makes no noise about it.  \"If I believed in your casuistry, I might think that to attack the enemy from behind was not a particularly fine thing to do, for even I would rather see a man's face than his rear--particularly in the case of my brother and sister, who are both handsome to look upon.  But what can a man do?  After all, the best thing to do is what wins the victory and makes the game.  Indeed, my mode of warfare has found supporters among the wise.  If you want to catch mice you must waste bacon, and if we are to tempt men into a snare we must know what their notions and ideas are, and begin by endeavoring to confuse them.  \"A bull is least dangerous when he runs straight ahead in his fury; while his two-legged opponent is least dangerous when he does not know what he is about and runs feeling his way first to the right and then to the left.  Thanks to your approval--for I have deserved it, and I hope to be able to return it, my friend Hierax.  I am curious as to your report. Shake up the cushion here under my head--and now you may begin.\"  \"All appears admirably arranged,\" answered the general.  \"The flower of our troops, the Diadoches and Hetairoi, two thousand-five hundred men, are on their way hither, and by to-morrow will encamp north of Memphis. Five hundred will find their way into the citadel, with the priests and other visitors to congratulate you on your birthday, the other two thousand will remain concealed in the tents.  The captain of your brother Philometor's Philobasilistes is bought over, and will stand by us; but his price was high--Komanus was forced to offer him twenty talents before he would bite.\"  \"He shall have them,\" said the king laughing, \"and he shall keep them too, till it suits me to regard him as suspicious, and to reward him according to his deserts by confiscating his estates.  Well! proceed.\"  \"In order to quench the rising in Thebes, the day before yesterday Philometor sent the best of the mercenaries with the standards of Desilaus and Arsinoe to the South.  Certainly it cost not a little to bribe the ringleaders, and to stir up the discontent to an outbreak.\"  \"My brother will repay us for this outlay,\" interrupted the king, \"when we pour his treasure into our own coffers.  Go on.\"  \"We shall have most difficulty with the priests and the Jews.  The former cling to Philometor, because he is the eldest son of his father, and has given large bounties to the temples, particularly of Apollinopolis and Philae; the Jews are attached to him, because he favors them more than the Greeks, and he, and his wife--your illustrious sister--trouble themselves with their vain religious squabbles; he disputes with them about the doctrines contained in their book, and at table too prefers conversing with them to any one else.\"  \"I will salt the wine and meat for them that they fatten on here,\" cried Euergetes vehemently, \"I forbade to-day their presence at my table, for they have good eyes and wits as sharp as their noses.  And they are most dangerous when they are in fear, or can reckon on any gains.  \"At the same time it cannot be denied that they are honest and tenacious, and as most of them are possessed of some property they rarely make common cause with the shrieking mob--particularly here in Alexandria.  \"Envy alone can reproach them for their industry and enterprise, for the activity of the Hellenes has improved upon the example set by them and their Phoenician kindred.  \"They thrive best in peaceful times, and since the world runs more quietly here, under my brother and sister, than under me, they attach themselves to them, lend my brother money, and supply my sister with cut stones, sapphires and emeralds, selling fine stuffs and other woman's gear for a scrap of written papyrus, which will soon be of no more value than the feather which falls from the wing of that green screaming bird on the perch yonder.  \"It is incomprehensible to me that so keen a people cannot perceive that there is nothing permanent but change, nothing so certain as that nothing is certain; and that they therefore should regard their god as the one only god, their own doctrine as absolutely and eternally true, and that they contemn what other peoples believe.  \"These darkened views make fools of them, but certainly good soldiers too--perhaps by reason indeed of this very exalted self-consciousness and their firm reliance on their supreme god.\"  \"Yes, they certainly are,\" assented Hierax.  \"But they serve your brother more willingly, and at a lower price, than us.\"  \"I will show them,\" cried the king, \"that their taste is a perverted and obnoxious one.  I require of the priests that they should instruct the people to be obedient, and to bear their privations patiently; but the Jews,\" and at these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5463"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 3 (#3)"],["body"," his eyes rolled with an ominous glare, \"the Jews I will exterminate, when the time comes.\"  \"That will be good for our treasury too,\" laughed Komanus.  \"And for the temples in the country,\" added Euergetes, \"for though I seek to extirpate other foes I would rather win over the priests; and I must try to win them if Philometor's kingdom falls into my hands, for the Egyptians require that their king should be a god; and I cannot arrive at the dignity of a real god, to whom my swarthy subjects will pray with thorough satisfaction, and without making my life a burden to me by continual revolts, unless I am raised to it by the suffrages of the priests.\"  \"And nevertheless,\" replied Hierax, who was the only one of Euergetes' dependents, who dared to contradict him on important questions, \"nevertheless this very day a grave demand is to be preferred on your account to the high-priest of Serapis.  You press for the surrender of a servant of the god, and Philometor will not neglect--\"  \"Will not neglect,\" interrupted Euergetes, \"to inform the mighty Asclepiodorus that he wants the sweet creature for me, and not for himself.  Do you know that Eros has pierced my heart, and that I burn for the fair Irene, although these eyes have not yet been blessed with the sight of her?  \"I see you believe me, and I am speaking the exact truth, for I vow I will possess myself of this infantine Hebe as surely as I hope to win my brother's throne; but when I plant a tree, it is not merely to ornament my garden but to get some use of it.  You will see how I will win over both the prettiest of little lady-loves and the high-priest who, to be sure, is a Greek, but still a man hard to bend.  My tools are all ready outside there.  \"Now, leave me, and order Eulaeus to join me here.\"  \"You are as a divinity,\" said  Komanus, bowing deeply, \"and we but as frail mortals.  Your proceedings often seem dark and incomprehensible to our weak intellect, but when a course, which to us seems to lead to no good issue, turns out well, we are forced to admit with astonishment that you always choose the best way, though often a tortuous one.\"  For a short time the king was alone, sitting with his black brows knit, and gazing meditatively at the floor.  But as soon as he heard the soft foot-fall of Eulaeus, and the louder step of his guide, he once more assumed the aspect of a careless and reckless man of the world, shouted a jolly welcome to Eulaeus, reminded him of his, the king's, boyhood, and of how often he, Eulaeus, had helped him to persuade his mother to grant him some wish she had previously refused him.  \"But now, old boy,\" continued the king, \"the times are changed, and with you now-a-days it is everything for Philometor and nothing for poor Euergetes, who, being the younger, is just the one who most needs your assistance.\"  Eulaeus bowed with a smile which conveyed that he understood perfectly how little the king's last words were spoken in earnest, and he said:  \"I purposed always to assist the weaker of you two, and that is what I believe myself to be doing now.\"  \"You mean my sister?\"  \"Our sovereign lady Cleopatra is of the sex which is often unjustly called the weaker.  Though you no doubt were pleased to speak in jest when you asked that question, I feel bound to answer you distinctly that it was not Cleopatra that I meant, but King Philometor.\"  \"Philometor?  Then you have no faith in his strength, you regard me as stronger than he; and yet, at the banquet to-day, you offered me your services, and told me that the task had devolved upon you of demanding the surrender of the little serving-maiden of Serapis, in the king's name, of Asclepiodorus, the high-priest.  Do you call that aiding the weaker?  But perhaps you were drunk when you told me that?  \"No?  You were more moderate than I?  Then some other change of views must have taken place in you; and yet that would very much surprise me, since your principles require you to aid the weaker son of my mother--\"  \"You are laughing at me,\" interrupted the courtier with gentle reproachfulness, and yet in a tone of entreaty.  \"If I took your side it was not from caprice, but simply and expressly from a desire to remain faithful to the one aim and end of my life.\"  \"And that is?\"  \"To provide for the welfare of this country in the same sense as did your illustrious mother, whose counsellor I was.\"  \"But you forget to mention the other--to place yourself to the best possible advantage.\"  \"I did not forget it, but I did not mention it, for I know how closely measured out are the moments of a king; and besides, it seems to me as self-evident that we think of our personal advantage as that when we buy a horse we also buy his shadow.\"  \"How subtle!  But I no more blame you than I should a girl who stands before her mirror to deck herself for her lover, and who takes the same opportunity of rejoicing in her own beauty.  \"However, to return to your first speech.  It is for the sake of Egypt as you think--if I understand you rightly--that you now offer me the services you have hitherto devoted to my brother's interests?\"  \"As you say; in these difficult times the country needs the will and the hand of a powerful leader.\"  \"And such a leader you think I am?\"  \"Aye, a giant in strength of will, body and intellect--whose desire to unite the two parts of Egypt in your sole possession cannot fail, if you strike and grasp boldly, and if--\"  \"If?\"  repeated the king, looking at the speaker so keenly that his eyes fell, and he answered softly:  \"If Rome should raise no objection.\"  Euergetes shrugged his shoulders, and replied gravely:  \"Rome indeed is like Fate, which always must give the final decision in everything we do.  I have certainly not been behindhand in enormous sacrifices to mollify that inexorable power, and my representative, through whose hands pass far greater sums than through those of the paymasters of the troops, writes me word that they are not unfavorably disposed towards me in the Senate.\"  \"We have learned that from ours also.  You have more friends by the Tiber than Philometor, my own king, has; but our last despatch is already several weeks old, and in the last few days things have occurred--\"  \"Speak!\" cried Euergetes, sitting bolt upright on his cushions.  \"But if you are laying a trap for me, and if you are speaking now as my brother's tool, I will punish you--aye! and if you fled to the uttermost cave of the Troglodytes I would have you followed up, and you should be torn in pieces alive, as surely as I believe myself to be the true son of my father.\"  \"And I should deserve the punishment,\" replied Eulaeus humbly.  Then he went on: \"If I see clearly, great events lie before us in the next few days.\"  \"Yes--truly,\" said Euergetes firmly.  \"But just at present Philometor is better represented in Rome than he has ever been.  You made acquaintance with young Publius Scipio at the king's table, and showed little zeal in endeavoring to win his good graces.\"  \"He is one of the Cornelii,\" interrupted the king, \"a distinguished young man, and related to all the noblest blood of Rome; but he is not an ambassador; he has travelled from Athens to Alexandria, in order to learn more than he need; and he carries his head higher and speaks more freely than becomes him before kings, because the young fellows fancy it looks well to behave like their elders.\"  \"He is of more importance than you imagine.\"  \"Then I will invite him to Alexandria, and there will win him over in three days, as surely as my name is Euergetes.\"  \"It will then be too late, for he has to-day received, as I know for certain, plenipotentiary powers from the Senate to act in their name in case of need, until the envoy who is to be sent here again arrives.\"  \"And I only now learn this for the first time!\" cried the king springing up from his couch, \"my friends must be deaf, and blind and dull indeed, if still I have any, and my servants and emissaries too!  I cannot bear this haughty ungracious fellow, but I will invite him tomorrow morning-- nay I will invite him to-day, to a festive entertainment, and send him the four handsomest horses that I have brought with me from Cyrene.  I will--\"  \"It will all be in vain,\" said Eulaeus calmly and dispassionately. \"For he is master, in the fullest and widest meaning of the word, of the queen's favor--nay--if I may permit myself to speak out freely--of Cleopatra's more than warm liking, and he enjoys this sweetest of gifts with a thankful heart.  Philometor--as he always does--lets matters go as they may, and Cleopatra and Publius--Publius and Cleopatra triumph even publicly in their love; gaze into each other's eyes like any pair of pastoral Arcadians, exchange cups and kiss the rim on the spot where the lips of the other have touched it.  Promise and grant what you will to this man, he will stand by your sister; and if you should succeed in expelling her from the throne he would boldly treat you as Popilius Laenas did your uncle Antiochus: he would draw a circle round your person, and say that if you dared to step beyond it Rome would march against you.\"  Euergetes listened in silence, then, flinging away the draperies that wrapped his body, he paced up and down in stormy agitation, groaning from time to time, and roaring like a wild bull that feels itself confined with cords and bands, and that exerts all its strength in vain to rend them.  Finally he stood still in front of Eulaeus and asked him:  \"What more do you know of the Roman?\"  \"He, who would not allow you to compare yourself to Alcibiades, is endeavoring to out-do that darling of the Athenian maidens; for he is not content with having stolen the heart of the king's wife, he is putting out his hand to reach the fairest virgin who serves the highest of the gods.  The water-bearer whom Lysias, the Roman's friend, recommended for a Hebe is beloved by Publius, and he hopes to enjoy her favors more easily in your gay palace than he "]]]
