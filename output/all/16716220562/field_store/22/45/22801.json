D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 9.    CHAPTER XXIII.  After accompanying Dion to the harbour, the architect had gone to the Forum to converse with the men he met there, and learn what they feared and expected in regard to the future fate of the city.  All news reached this meeting-place first, and he found a large number of Macedonian citizens who, like himself, wished to discuss passing events in these decisive hours.  The scene was very animated, for the most contradictory messages were constantly arriving from the fleet and the army.  At first they were very favourable; then came the news of the treason, and soon after of the desertion of the cavalry and foot soldiers.  A distinguished citizen had seen Mark Antony, accompanied by several friends, dashing down the quay.  The goal of their flight was the little palace on the Choma.  Grave men, whose opinion met with little opposition, thought that it was the duty of the Imperator--now that Fate had decided against him, and nothing remained save a life sullied by disgrace--to put himself to death with his own hand, like Brutus and so many other noble Romans.  Tidings soon came that he had attempted to do what the best citizens expected.  Gorgias could not endure to remain longer in the Forum, but hastened to the Choma, though it was difficult to force his way to the wall, where a breach had been made.  He had found the portion of the shore from which the promontory ran densely crowded with people--from whom he learned that Antony was no longer in the palace--and the sea filled with boats.  A corpse was just being borne out of the little palace on the Street of the King and, among those who followed, Gorgias recognized one of Antony's slaves.  The man's eyes were red with weeping.  He readily obeyed the architect's sign and, sobbing bitterly, told him that the hapless general, after his army had betrayed him, fled hither.  When he heard in the palace that Cleopatra had preceded him to Hades, he ordered his body-slave Eros to put an end to his life also.  The worthy man drew back, pierced his own breast with his sword, and sank dying at his master's feet; but Antony, exclaiming that Eros's example had taught him his duty, thrust the short sword into his breast with his own hand.  Yet deep and severe as was the wound, it did not destroy the tremendous vitality of the gigantic Roman.  With touching entreaties he implored the bystanders to kill him, but no one could bring himself to commit the deed.  Meanwhile Cleopatra's name, coupled with the wish to follow her, was constantly on the lips of the Imperator.  At last Diomedes, the Queen's private secretary, appeared, to bring him, by her orders, to the mausoleum where she had taken refuge.  Antony, as if animated with fresh vigour, assented, and while being carried thither gave orders that Eros should have a worthy burial.  Even though dying, it would have been impossible for the most generous of masters to permit any kindness rendered to pass unrequited.  The slave again wept aloud as he uttered the words, but Gorgias hastened at once to the tomb.  The nearest way, the Street of the King, had become so crowded with people who had been forced back by Roman soldiers, between the Theatre of Dionysus and the Corner of the Muses, that he had been compelled to reach the building through a side street.  The quay was already unrecognizable, and even in the other streets the populace showed a foreign aspect.  Instead of peaceful citizens, Roman soldiers in full armour were met everywhere.  Instead of Greek, Egyptian, and Syrian faces, fair and dark visages of alien appearance were seen.  The city seemed transformed into a camp.  Here he met a cohort of fair- haired Germans; yonder another with locks of red whose home he did not know; and again a vexil of Numidian or Pannonian horsemen.  At the Temple of the Dioscuri he was stopped.  A Hispanian maniple had just seized Antony's son Antyllus and, after a hasty court-martial, killed him.  His tutor, Theodotus, had betrayed him to the Romans, but the infamous fellow was being led with bound hands after the corpse of the hapless youth, because he was caught in the act of hiding in his girdle a costly jewel which he had taken from his neck.  Before his departure for the island Gorgias heard that the scoundrel had been sentenced to crucifixion.  At last he succeeded in forcing a passage to the tomb, which he found surrounded on all sides by Roman lictors and the Scythian guards of the city, who, however, permitted him, as the architect, to pass.  The numerous obstacles by which he had been delayed spared him from becoming an eye-witness of the most terrible scenes of the tragedy which had just ended; but he received a minute description from the Queen's private secretary, a well-disposed Macedonian, who had accompanied the wounded Antony, and with whom Gorgias had become intimately acquainted during the building of the mausoleum.  Cleopatra had fled to the tomb as soon as the fortune of war turned in favour of Octavianus.  No one was permitted to accompany her except Charmian and Iras, who had helped her close the heavy brazen door of the massive building.  The false report of her death, which had induced Antony to put an end to his life, had perhaps arisen from the fact that the Queen was literally in the tomb.  When, borne in the arms of his faithful servants, he reached the mausoleum, mortally wounded, the Queen and her attendants vainly endeavoured to open the heavy brazen portal.  But Cleopatra ardently longed to see her dying lover.  She wished to have him near to render the last services, assure him once more of her devotion, close his eyes, and, if it was so ordered, die with him.  So she and her attendants had searched the place, and when Iras spoke of the windlass which stood on the scaffold to raise the heavy brass plate bearing the bas-relief of Love conquering Death, the Queen and her friends hastened up the stairs, the bearer below fastened the wounded man to the rope, and Cleopatra herself stood at the windlass to raise him, aided by her faithful companions.  Diomedes averred that he had never beheld a more piteous spectacle than the gigantic man hovering between heaven and earth in the agonies of death and, while suffering the most terrible torture, extending his arms longingly towards the woman he loved.  Though scarcely able to speak, he tenderly called her name, but she made no reply; like Iras and Charmian, she was exerting her whole strength at the windlass in the most passionate effort to raise him.  The rope running over the pulley cut her tender hands; her beautiful face was terribly distorted; but she did not pause until they had succeeded in lifting the burden of the dying man higher and higher till he reached the floor of the scaffolding.  The frantic exertion by which the three women had succeeded in accomplishing an act far beyond their strength, though it was doubled by the power of the most earnest will and ardent longing, would nevertheless have failed in attaining its object had not Diomedes, at the last moment, come to their assistance.  He was a strong man, and by his aid the dying Roman was seized, drawn upon the scaffolding, and carried down the staircase to the tomb in the first story.  When the wounded general had been laid on one of the couches with which the great hall was already furnished, the private secretary retired, but remained on the staircase, an unnoticed spectator, in order to be at hand in case the Queen again needed his assistance.  Flushed from the terrible exertion which she had just made, with tangled, dishevelled locks, gasping and moaning, Cleopatra, as if out of her senses, tore open her robe, beat her breast, and lacerated it with her nails.  Then, pressing her own beautiful face on her lover's wound to stanch the flowing blood, she lavished upon him all the endearing names which she had bestowed on their love.  His terrible suffering made her forget her own and the sad fate impending.  Tears of pity fell like the refreshing drops of a shower upon the still unwithered blossoms of their love, and brought those which, during the preceding night, had revived anew, to their last magnificent unfolding.  Boundless, limitless as her former passion for this man, was now the grief with which his agonizing death filled her heart.  All that Mark Antony had been to her in the heyday of life, all their mutual experiences, all that each had received from the other, had returned to her memory in clear and vivid hues during the banquet which had closed a few hours ago.  Now these scenes, condensed into a narrow compass, again passed before her mental vision, but only to reveal more distinctly the depth of misery of this hour.  At last anguish forced even the clearest memories into oblivion: she saw nothing save the tortures of her lover; her brain, still active, revealed solely the gulf at her feet, and the tomb which yawned not only for Antony, but for herself.  Unable to think of the happiness enjoyed in the past or to hope for it in the future, she gave herself up to uncontrolled despair, and no woman of the people could have yielded more absolutely to the consuming grief which rent her heart, or expressed it in wilder, more frantic language, than did this great Queen, this woman who as a child had been so sensitive to the slightest suffering, and whose after-life had certainly not taught her to bear sorrow with patience.  After Charmian, at the dying man's request, had given him some wine, he found strength to speak coherently, instead of moaning and sighing.  He tenderly urged Cleopatra to secure her own safety, if it could be done without dishonour, and mentioned Proculejus as the man"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5481"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 09 (#1)"],["body","worthy of her confidence among the friends of Octavianus.  Then he entreated her not to mourn for him, but to consider him happy; for he had enjoyed the richest favours of Fortune.  He owed his brightest hours to her love; but he had also been the first and most powerful man on earth.  Now he was dying in the arms of Love, honourable as a Roman who succumbed to Romans.  In this conviction he died after a short struggle.  Cleopatra had watched his last breath, closed his eyes, and then thrown herself tearlessly on her lover's body.  At last she fainted, and lay unconscious with her head upon his marble breast.  The private secretary had witnessed all this, and then returned with tearful eyes to the second story.  There he met Gorgias, who had climbed the scaffolding, and told him what he had seen and heard from the stairs. But his story was scarcely ended when a carriage stopped at the Corner of the Muses and an aristocratic Roman alighted.  This was the very Proculejus whom the dying Antony had recommended to the woman he loved as worthy of her confidence.  \"In fact,\" Gorgias continued, \"he seemed in form and features one of the noblest of his haughty race.  He came commissioned by Octavianus, and is said to be warmly devoted to the Caesar, and a well-disposed man.  We have also heard him mentioned as a poet and a brother-in-law of Maecenas. A wealthy aristocrat, he is a generous patron of literature, and also holds art and science in high esteem.  Timagenes lauds his culture and noble nature.  Perhaps the historian was right; but where the object in question is the state and its advantage, what we here regard as worthy of a free man appears to be considered of little moment at the court of Octavianus.  The lord to whom he gives his services intrusted him with a difficult task, and Proculejus doubtless considered it his duty to make every effort to perform it--and yet----If I see aright, a day will come when he will curse this, and the obedience with which he, a free man, aided Caesar  But listen.  \"Erect and haughty in his splendid suit of armour, he knocked at the door of the tomb.  Cleopatra had regained consciousness and asked--she must have known him in Rome--what he desired.  \"He had come, he answered courteously, by the command of Octavianus, to negotiate with her, and the Queen expressed her willingness to listen, but refused to admit him into the mausoleum.  \"So they talked with each other through the door.  With dignified composure, she asked to have the sons whom she had given to Antony--not Caasarion--acknowledged as Kings of Egypt.  \"Proculejus instantly promised to convey her wishes to Caesar, and gave hopes of their fulfilment.  \"While she was speaking of the children and their claims--she did not mention her own future--the Roman questioned her about Mark Antony's death, and then described the destruction of the dead man's army and other matters of trivial importance.  Proculejus did not look like a babbler, but I felt a suspicion that he was intentionally trying to hold the attention of the Queen.  This proved to be his design; he had been merely waiting for Cornelius Gallus, the commander of the fleet, of whom you have heard.  He, too, ranks among the chief men in Rome, and yet he made himself the accomplice of Proculejus.  \"The latter retired as soon as he had presented the new-comer to the hapless woman.  \"I remained at my post and now heard Gallus assure Cleopatra of his master's sympathy.  With the most bombastic exaggeration he described how bitterly Octavianus mourned in Mark Antony the friend, the brother-in- law, the co-ruler and sharer in so many important enterprises.  He had shed burning tears over the tidings of his death.  Never had more sincere ones coursed down any man's cheeks.  \"Gallus, too, seemed to me to be intentionally prolonging the conversation.  \"Then, while I was listening intently to understand Cleopatra's brief replies, my foreman, who, when the workmen were driven away by the Romans, had concealed himself between two blocks of granite, came to me and said that Proculejus had just climbed a ladder to the scaffold in the rear of the monument.  Two servants followed, and they had all stolen down into the hall.  \"I hastily started up.  I had been lying on the floor with my head outstretched to listen.  \"Cost what it might, the Queen must be warned.  Treachery was certainly at work here.  \"But I came too late.  \"O Dion!  If I had only been informed a few minutes before, perhaps something still more terrible might have happened, but the Queen would have been spared what now threatens her.  What can she expect from the conqueror who, in order to seize her alive, condescends to outwit a noble, defenceless woman, who has succumbed to superior power?  \"Death would have released the unhappy Queen from sore trouble and horrible shame.  And she had already raised the dagger against her life. Before my eyes she flung aloft her beautiful arm with the flashing steel, which glittered in the light of the candles in the many-branched candelabra beside the sarcophagi.  But I will try to remain calm!  You shall hear what happened in regular order.  My thoughts grow confused as the terrible scene recurs to my memory.  To describe it as I saw it, I should need to be a poet, an artist in words; for what passed before me happened on a stage--you know, it was a tomb.  The walls were of dark stone-dark, too, were the pillars and ceiling--all dark and glittering; most portions were smoothly polished stone, shining like a mirror.  Near the sarcophagi, and around the candelabra as far as the vicinity of the door, where the rascally trick was played, the light was brilliant as in a festal hall.  Every blood-stain on the hand, every scratch, every wound which the desperate woman had torn with her own nails on her bosom, which gleamed snow-white from her black robes, was distinctly visible.  Farther away, on the right and left, the light was dim, and near the side walls the darkness was as intense as in a real tomb.  On the smooth porphyry columns, the glittering black marble and serpentine--here, there, and everywhere--flickered the wavering reflection of the candlelight.  The draught kept it continually in motion, and it wavered to and fro in the hall, like the restless souls of the damned.  Wherever the eye turned it met darkness.  The end of the hall seemed black--black as the anteroom of Hades--yet through it pierced a brilliant moving bar; sunbeams which streamed from the stairway into the tomb and amid which danced tiny motes.  How the scene impressed the eye!  The home of gloomy Hecate!  And the Queen and her impending fate.  A picture flooded with light, standing forth in radiant relief against the darkness of the heavy, majestic forms surrounding it in a wide circle.  This tomb in this light would be a palace meet for the gloomy rule of the king of the troop of demons conjured up by the power of a magician--if they have a ruler.  But where am I wandering?  'The artist!'  I hear you  exclaim  again, 'the  artist! Instead of rushing forward and interposing, he stands studying the light and its effects in the royal tomb.'  Yes, yes; I had come too late, too late--far too late!  On the stairs leading to the lower story of the building I saw it, but I was not to blame for the delay--not in the least!  \"At first I had been unable to see the men--or even a shadow; but I beheld plainly in the brightest glare of the light the body of Mark Antony on the couch and, in the dusk farther towards the right, Iras and Charmian trying to raise a trapdoor.  It was the one which closed the passage leading to the combustible materials stored in the cellar.  A sign from the Queen had commanded them to fire it.  The first steps of the staircase, down which I was hastening, were already behind me--then-- then Proculejus, with two men, suddenly dashed from the intense darkness on the other side.  Scarcely able to control myself, I sprang down the remaining steps, and while Iras's shrill cry, 'Poor Cleopatra, they will capture you!' still rang in my ears, I saw the betrayed Queen turn from the door through which, resolved on death, she was saying something to Gallus, perceive Proculejus close behind her, thrust her hand into her girdle, and with the speed of lightning--you have already heard so--throw up her arm with the little dagger to bury the sharp blade in her breast. What a picture!  In the full radiance of the brilliant light, she resembled a statue of triumphant victory or of noble pride in great deeds accomplished; and then, then, only an instant later, what an outrage was inflicted!  \"Like a robber, an assassin, Proculejus rushed upon her, seized her arm, and wrested the weapon from her grasp.  His tall figure concealed her from me.  But when, struggling to escape from the ruffian's clutch, she again turned her face towards the hall, what a transformation had occurred!  Her eyes--you know how large they are--were twice their usual size, and blazed with scorn, fury, and hatred for the traitor.  The cheering light had become a consuming fire.  So I imagine the vengeance, the curse which calls down ruin upon the head of a foe.  And Proculejus, the great lord, the poet whose noble nature is praised by the authors on the banks of the Tiber, held the defenceless woman, the worthy daughter of a brilliant line of kings, in a firm grasp, as if it required the exertion of all his strength to master this delicate embodiment of charming womanhood.  True, the proud blood of the outwitted lioness urged her to resist this profanation, and Proculejus--an enviable honour--made her feel the superior strength of his arm.  I am no prophet, but Dion, I repeat, this shameful struggle and the glances which flashed upon him will be remembered to his dying hour.  Had they been darted at me, I should have cursed my life.  \"They blanched even the Roman's cheeks.  He was lividly pale as he completed what he deemed his duty. "]]]
