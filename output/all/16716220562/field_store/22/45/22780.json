D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 5.    CHAPTER XII.  Barine had been an hour in the palace.  The magnificently furnished room to which she was conducted was directly above the council chamber, and sometimes, in the silence of the night, the voice of the Queen or the loud cheers of men were distinctly heard.  Barine listened without making the slightest effort to catch the meaning of the words which reached her ears.  She longed only for something to divert her thoughts from the deep and bitter emotion which filled her soul.  Ay, she was roused to fury, and yet she felt how completely this passionate resentment contradicted her whole nature.  True, the shameless conduct of Philostratus during their married life had often stirred the inmost depths of her placid, kindly spirit, and after wards his brother Alexas had come to drive her, by his disgraceful proposals, to the verge of despair; rage was added to the passionate agitation of her soul, and for this she had cause to rejoice--but for this mighty resentment during the time of struggle she might have, perhaps, succumbed from sheer weariness and the yearning desire to rest.  At last, at last, she and her friends, by means of great sacrifices, had succeeded in releasing her from these tortures.  Philostratus's consent to liberate her was purchased.  Alexas's persecution had ceased long before; he had first been sent away as envoy by his patron Antony, and afterwards been compelled to accompany him to the war.  How she had enjoyed the peaceful days in her mother's house!  How quickly the bright cheerfulness which she had supposed lost had returned to her soul!--and to-day Fate had blessed her with the greatest happiness life had ever offered.  True, she had had only a few brief hours in which to enjoy it, for the attack of the unbridled boys and the wound inflicted upon her lover had cast a heavy shadow on her bliss.  Her mother had again proved to be in the right when she so confidently predicted a second misfortune which would follow the first only too soon.  Barine had been torn at midnight from her peaceful home and her wounded lover's bedside.  This was done by the Queen's command, and, full of angry excitement, she said to herself that the men were right who cursed tyranny because it transformed free human beings into characterless chattels.  There could be nothing good awaiting her; that was proved by the messengers whom Cleopatra had sent to summon her at this unprecedented hour.  They were her worst enemies: Iras, who desired to wed her lover-- Dion had told her so after the assault--and Alexas, whose suit she had rejected in a way which a man never forgives.  She had already learned Iras's feelings.  The slender figure with the narrow head, long, delicate nose, small chin, and pointed fingers, seemed to her like a long, sharp thorn.  This strange comparison had entered her head as Iras stood rigidly erect, reading aloud in a shrill, high voice the Queen's command.  Everything about this hard, cold face appeared as sharp as a sting, and ready to destroy her.  Her removal from her mother's house to the royal palace had been swift and simple.  After the attack--of which she saw little, because, overpowered by fear and horror, she closed her eyes--she had driven home with her lover, where the leech had bandaged his injuries, and Berenike had quickly and carefully transformed her own sleeping chamber into a sick-room.  Barine, after changing her dress, did not leave Dion's side.  She had attired herself carefully, for she knew his delight in outward adornment. When she returned from her grandparents, before sunset, she was alone with him, and he, kissing her arm, had murmured that wherever the Greek tongue was spoken there was not one more beautiful.  The gem was worthy of its loveliness.  So she had opened her baggage to take out the circlet which Antony had given, and it again enclasped her arm when she entered the sick-room.  Because Dion had told her that he deemed her fairest in the simple white robe she had worn a few days before, when there were no guests save himself and Gorgias, and she had sung until after midnight his favourite songs as though all were intended for him alone, her choice had fallen upon this garment.  And she rejoiced that she had worn it--the wounded man's eyes rested upon her so joyously when she sat down opposite to him.  The physician had forbidden him to talk, and urged him to sleep if possible.  So Barine only held his hand in silence, whispering, whenever he opened his eyes, a tender word of love and encouragement.  She had remained with him for hours, leaving her place at his side merely to give him his medicine, or, with her mother's aid, place poultices on his wounds.  When his manly face was distorted by suffering, she shared his pain; but during most of the time a calm, pleasant sense of happiness pervaded her mind.  She felt safe and sheltered in the possession of the man whom she loved, though fully aware of the perils which threatened him, and, perhaps, her also.  But the assurance of his love completely filled her heart and cast every care entirely into the shade.  Many men had seemed estimable and agreeable, a few even desirable husbands, but Dion was the first to awaken love in her ardent but by no means passionate soul.  She regarded the experiences of the past few days as a beautiful miracle. How she had yearned and pined until the most fervent desire of her heart was fulfilled!  Now Dion had offered her his love, and nothing could rob her of it.  Gorgias and the sons of her uncle Arius had disturbed her a short time. After they had gone with a good report, Berenike had entreated her daughter to lie down and let her take her place.  But Barine would not leave her lover's couch, and had just loosed her hair to brush it again and fasten the thick, fair braids around her head, when, two hours after midnight, some one knocked loudly on the window shutters.  Berenike was in the act of removing the poultice, so Barine herself went into the atrium to wake the doorkeeper.  But the old man was not asleep, and had anticipated her.  She recognized, with a low cry of terror, the first person who entered the lighted vestibule--Alexas.  Iras followed, her head closely muffled, for the storm was still howling through the streets.  Last of all a lantern- bearer crossed the threshold.  The Syrian saluted the startled young beauty with a formal bow, but Iras, without a greeting or even a single word of preparation, delivered the Queen's command, and then read aloud, by the light of the lantern, what Cleopatra had scrawled upon the wax tablet.  When Barine, pallid and scarcely able to control her emotion, requested the messengers who had arrived at so late an hour to enter, in order to give her time to prepare for the night drive and take leave of her mother, Iras vouchsafed no reply, but, as if she had the right to rule the house, merely ordered the doorkeeper to bring his mistress's cloak without delay.  While the old man, with trembling knees, moved away, Iras asked if the wounded Dion was in the dwelling; and Barine, her self-control restored by the question, answered, with repellent pride, that the Queen's orders did not command her to submit to an examination in her own house.  Iras shrugged her shoulders and said, sneeringly, to Alexas:  \"In truth, I asked too much.  One who attracts so many men of all ages can scarcely be expected to know the abode of each individual.\"  \"The heart has a faithful memory,\" replied the Syrian in a tone of correction, but Iras echoed, contemptuously, \"The heart!\"  Then all were silent until, instead of the doorkeeper, Berenike herself came hurrying in, bringing the cloak.  With pallid face and bloodless lips she wrapped it around her daughter's shoulders, whispering, amid floods of tears, almost inaudible words of love and encouragement, which Iras interrupted by requesting Barine to follow her to the carriage.  The mother and daughter embraced and kissed each other, then the closed equipage bore the persecuted woman through the storm and darkness to Lochias.  Not a word was exchanged between Barine and the Queen's messengers until they reached the room where the former was to await Cleopatra; but here Iras again endeavoured to induce her to speak.  At the first question, however, Barine answered that she had no information to give.  The room was as bright as if it were noonday, though the lights flickered constantly, for the wind found its way through the thin shutters closing the windows on both sides of the corner room, and a strong, cold draught swept in.  Barine wrapped her cloak more closely around her; the storm which howled about the sea-washed palace harmonized with the vehement agitation of her soul.  Whether she had looked within or without, there was nothing which could have soothed her save the assurance of being loved--an assurance that held fear at bay.  Now, indignation prevented dread from overpowering her, yet calm consideration could not fail to show her that danger threatened on every hand.  The very manner in which Iras and Alexas whispered together, without heeding her presence, boded peril, for courtiers show such contempt only to those whom they know are threatened with the indifference or resentment of the sovereign.  Barine, during her married life with a man devoid of all delicacy of feeling, and with a disposition as evil as his tongue was ready, had learned to endure many things which were hard to bear; yet when, after a remark from Iras evidently concerning her, she heard Alexas laugh, she was compelled to exert the utmost self-restraint to avoid telling her enemy how utterly she despised the cowardly cruelty of her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5477"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 05 (#1)"],["body","uct.  But she succeeded in keeping silent.  Still, the painful constraint she imposed on herself must find vent in some way, and, as the tortured anguish of her soul reached its height, large tears rolled down her cheeks.  These, too, were noticed by her enemy and made the target of her wit; but this time the sarcasm failed to produce its effect upon the Syrian, for, instead of laughing, he grew grave, and whispered something which seemed to Barine a reproof or a warning.  Iras's reply was merely a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.  Barine had noticed long before that her mother, in her fear and bewilderment, had brought her own cloak instead of her daughter's, and this circumstance also did not seem to her foe too trivial for a sneer.  But the childish insolence that seemed to have taken possession of one who usually by no means lacked dignity, was merely the mask beneath which she concealed her own suffering.  A grave motive was the source of the mirth by which she affected to be moved at the sight of her enemy's cloak.  The grey, ill-fitting garment disfigured Barine, and she desired that the Queen should feel confident of surpassing her rival even in outward charms.  No one, not even Cleopatra, could dispense with a protecting wrap in this cold draught, and nothing suited her better than the purple mantle in whose delicate woollen fabric black and gold dragons and griffins were embroidered.  Iras had taken care that it lay ready. Barine could not fail to appear like a beggar in comparison, though Alexas said that her blue kerchief was marvellously becoming.  He was a base-minded voluptuary, who, aided by rich gifts of mind and wide knowledge, had shunned no means of ingratiating himself with Antony, the most lavish of patrons.  The repulse which this man, accustomed to success, had received from Barine had been hard to forget, yet he did not resign the hope of winning her.  Never had she seemed more desirable than in her touching weakness.  Even base natures are averse to witnessing the torture of the defenceless, and when Iras had aimed another poisoned shaft at her, he ventured, at the risk of vexing his ally, to say, under his breath:  \"Condemned criminals are usually granted, before their end, a favourite dish.  I have no cause to wish Barine anything good; but I would not grudge that.  You, on the contrary, seem to delight in pouring wormwood on her last mouthful.\"  \"Certainly,\" she answered, her eyes sparkling brightly.  \"Malice is the purest of pleasures; at least to me, when exercised on this woman.\"  The Syrian, with a strange smile, held out his hand, saying: \"Keep your good-will towards me, Iras.\"  \"Because,\" she retorted with a  sneer, \"evil may follow my enmity.  I think so, too.  I am not especially sensitive concerning myself, but whoever dares\"--here she raised her voice--\"to harm one whom I--Just listen to the cheers!  How she carries all hearts with her!  Though Fate had made her a beggar, she would still be peerless among women.  She is like the sun.  The clouds which intrude upon her pathway of radiance are consumed and disappear.\"  While uttering the last sentence she had turned towards Barine, whose ear the sharp voice again pierced like a thorn, as she commanded her to prepare for the examination.  Almost at the same moment the door, caught by the wind, closed with a loud bang.  The \"introducer\"--[Marshal of the court.]--had opened it, and, after a hasty glance, exclaimed:  \"The audience will not be given in this meeting place for all the winds of heaven!  Her Majesty desires to receive her late visitor in the Hall of Shells.\"  With these words he bowed courteously to Barine, and ushered her and her two companions through several corridors and apartments into a well- heated anteroom.  Here even the windows were thoroughly protected from the storm.  Several body-guards and pages belonging to the corps of the \"royal boys\" stood waiting to receive them.  \"This is comfortable.\"  said Alexas, turning to Iras.  \"Was the winter we have just experienced intended to fill us with twofold gratitude for the delights of the mild spring in this blessed room?\"  \"Perhaps so,\" she answered sullenly, and then added in a low tone: \"Here at Lochias the seasons do not follow their usual course.  They change according to the pleasure of the supreme will.  Instead of four, the Egyptians, as you know, have but three; in the palaces on the Nile they are countless.  What is the meaning of this sudden entry of summer? Winter would have pleased me better.\"  The Queen--Iras knew not why--had changed her arrangements for Barine's reception.  This vexed her, and her features assumed a gloomy, threatening expression as the young beauty, casting aside her cloak and kerchief, stood awaiting Cleopatra in a white robe of fine material and perfect fit.  The thick, fair braids, wound simply around her shapely head, gave her an appearance of almost childish youth, and the sight made Iras feel as if she, and Cleopatra also, were outwitted.  In the dimly lighted atrium of the house near the Paneum garden, she had noticed only that Barine wore something white.  Had it been merely a night robe, so much the better.  But she might have appeared in her present garb at the festival of Isis.  The most careful deliberation could have selected nothing more suitable or becoming.  And did this vain woman go to rest with costly gold ornaments?  Else how did the circlet chance to be on her arm?  Each of Cleopatra's charms seemed to Iras, who knew them all, like a valuable possession of her own.  To see even the least of them surpassed by another vexed her; and to behold in yonder woman a form which she could not deny was no less beautiful, enraged, nay, pierced her to the heart.  Since she had known that because of Barine she could hope for nothing more from the man to whose love she believed she possessed a claim dating from their childhood, she had hated the young beauty.  And now to the many things which contributed to increase her hostile mood, was added the disagreeable consciousness that during the last few hours she had treated her contemptibly.  Had she only seen earlier what her foe's cloak concealed, she would have found means to give her a different appearance. But she must remain as she was; for Chairman had already entered.  Other hours, however, would follow, and if the next did not decide the fate of the woman whom she hated, future ones should.  For this purpose she did not need the aid of Charmian, her uncle Archibius's sister, who had hitherto been a beloved associate and maternal friend.  But what had happened?  Iras fancied that her pleasant features wore a repellent expression which she had never seen before. Was this also the singer's fault?  And what was the cause?  The older woman's manner decided the question whether she should still bestow upon her returned relative the love of a grateful niece.  No, she would no longer put any restraint upon herself.  Charmian should feel that she (Iras) considered any favour shown to her foe an insult.  To work against her secretly was not in her nature.  She had courage to show an enemy her aversion, and she did not fear Charmian enough to pursue a different course.  She knew that the artist Leonax, Barine's father, had been Charmian's lover; but this did not justify her favouring the woman who had robbed her niece of the heart of the man whom she--as Charmian knew--had loved from childhood.  Charmian had just had a long conversation with her brother, and had also learned in the palace that Barine had been summoned to the Queen's presence in the middle of the night; so, firmly persuaded that evil was intended to the young woman who had already passed through so many agitating scenes of joy and sorrow, she entered the waiting-room, and her pleasant though no longer youthful face, framed in smooth, grey hair, was greeted by Barine as the shipwrecked mariner hails the sight of land.  All the emotions which had darkened and embittered her soul were soothed. She hastened towards her friend's sister, as a frightened child seeks its mother, and Charmian perceived what was stirring in her heart.  It would not do, under existing circumstances, to kiss her in the palace, but she drew Leonax's daughter towards her to show Iras that she was ready to extend a protecting hand over the persecuted woman.  But Barine gazed at her with pleading glances, beseeching aid, whispering amid her tears: \"Help me, Charmian.  She has tortured, insulted, humiliated me with looks and words--so cruelly, so spitefully!  Help me; I can bear no more.\"  Charmian shook her kind head and urged her in a whisper to calm herself. She had robbed Iras of her lover; she should remember that.  Cost what it might, she must not shed another tear.  The Queen was gracious.  She, Charmian, would aid her.  Everything would depend on showing herself to Cleopatra as she was, not as slander represented her.  She must answer her as she would Archibius or herself.  The kindly woman, as she spoke, stroked her brow and eyes with maternal tenderness, and Barine felt as if goodness itself had quelled the tempest in her soul.  She gazed around her as though roused from a troubled dream, and now for the first time perceived the richly adorned room in which she stood, the admiring glances of the boys in the Macedonian corps of pages, and the bright fire blazing cheerily on the hearth.  The howling of the storm increased the pleasant sense of being under a firm roof, and Iras, who had whispered to the \"introducer\" at the door, no longer seemed like a sharp thorn or a spiteful demon, but a woman by no means destitute of charm, who repulsed her, but on whom she had inflicted the keenest pang a woman's heart can suffer.  Then she again thought of her wounded lover at home, and remembered that, whatever might happen, his heart did not belong to Iras, but to her alone.  Lastly, she recalled Archibius's description of Cleopatra's"]]]
