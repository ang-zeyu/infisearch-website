There is no city in the world where half so many gods are worshipped as here; and what strange deities are numbered among them!  It needs a special effort of the intellect to understand them. But the simple duties of the domestic hearth!--they are too prosaic for you Alexandrians, who imbibe philosophy with your mothers' milk.  What marvel, if I looked for them in vain?  True, they would find little satisfaction--our household gods I mean--here, where the rigid demands of Hymen are mute before the ardent pleadings of Eros.  Marriage is scarcely reckoned among the sacred things of life.  But this opinion seems to displease you.\"  \"Because it is false,\" cried Cleopatra, repressing with difficulty a fresh outburst of indignation.  \"Yet, if I see aright, your reproach is aimed only at the bond which united me to the man who was called your sister's husband.  But I will I would gladly remain silent, but you force me to speak, and I will do so, though your own friend, Proculejus, is signing to me to be cautious.  I--I, Cleopatra, was the wife of Mark Antony according to the customs of this country, when you wedded him to the widow of Marcellus, who had scarcely closed his eyes.  Not she, but I, was the deserted wife--I to whom his heart belonged until the hour of his death, not the unloved consort wedded--\"  Here her voice fell.  She had yielded to the passionate impulse which urged her to express her feelings in the matter, and now continued in a tone of gentle explanation:  \"I  know that you  proposed this alliance solely for the peace and welfare of Rome--\"  \"To guard both, and to spare the blood of tens of thousands,\" Octavianus added with proud decision.  \"Your clear brain perceived the true state of affairs.  If, spite of the grave importance of these motives, you-- But what voices would not that of the heart silence with you women!  The man, the Roman, succeeded in closing his ears to its siren song.  Were it otherwise, I would never have chosen for my sister a husband by whom I knew her happiness would be so ill-guarded--I would, as I have already said, be unable to master my own admiration of the loveliest of women. But I ought scarcely to boast of that.  I fear that a heart like yours opens less quickly to the modest Octavianus than to a Julius Caesar or the brilliant Mark Antony.  Yet I may be permitted to confess that perhaps I might have avoided conducting this unhappy war against my friend to the end under my own guidance, and appearing myself in Egypt, had I not been urged by the longing to see once more the woman who had dazzled my boyish eyes.  Now, in my mature manhood, I desired to comprehend those marvellous gifts of mind, that matchless sagacity--\"  \"Sagacity!\" interrupted the Queen, shrugging her shoulders mournfully. \"You possess a far greater share of what is commonly called by that name. My fate proves it.  The pliant intellect which the gods bestowed on me would ill sustain the test in this hour of anguish.  But if you really care to learn what mental power Cleopatra once possessed, relieve me of this terrible burden of uncertainty, and grant me a position in life which will permit my paralyzed soul to move freely once more.\"  \"It depends solely on yourself,\" Octavian eagerly responded, \"to make your future life, not only free from care, but beautiful.\"  \"On me?\"  asked Cleopatra in astonishment.   Our weal and woe are in your hands alone.  I am modest and ask nothing save to know what you intend for our future, what you mean by the lot which you term beautiful.\"  \"Nothing less,\"  replied the Caesar quietly, \"than what seems to lie nearest to your own heart--a life of that freedom of soul to which you aspire.\"  The breath of the agitated Queen began come more quickly and, no longer able to contr the impatience which overpowered her, she exclaimed, \"With the assurance of your favour on your lips, you refuse to discuss the question which interests, me beyond any other--for which, if any you must have been prepared when you came here--\"  \"Reproaches?\" asked Octavianus with we feigned surprise.  \"Would it not rather be my place to complain?  It is precisely because I am thoroughly sincere in the friendly disposition which you read aright from my words, that some of your measures cannot fail to wound me.  Your treasures were to be committed to the flames.  It would be unfair to expect tokens of friendship from the vanquished; but can you deny that even the bitterest hatred could scarcely succeed in devising anything more hostile?\"  \"Let the past rest!  Who would not seek in war to diminish the enemy's booty?\" pleaded the Queen in a soothing tone.  But as Octavianus delayed his answer, she continued more eagerly: \"It is said that the ibex in the mountains, when in mortal peril, rushes upon the hunter and hurls him with it down the precipice.  The same impulse is natural to human beings, and praiseworthy, I think, in both.  Forget the past, as I will try to do, I repeat with uplifted hands.  Say that you will permit the sons whom I gave to Antony to ascend the Egyptian throne, not under their mother's guardianship, but that of Rome, and grant me freedom wherever I may live, and I will gladly transfer to you, down to the veriest trifles, all the property and treasures I possess.\"  She clenched her little hand impatiently under the folds of her robe as she spoke; but Octavianus lowered his eyes, saying carelessly: \"In war the victor disposes of the property of the vanquished; but my heart restrains me from applying the universal law to you, who are so far above ordinary mortals.  Your wealth is said to be vast, though the foolish war which Antony, with your aid, so greatly prolonged, devoured vast sums. In this country squandered gold seems like the grass which, when mowed, springs up anew.\"  \"You speak,\" replied Cleopatra, more and more deeply incensed, with proud composure, \"of the treasures which my ancestors, the powerful monarchs of a wealthy country, amassed during three hundred years for their noble race and for the adornment of the women of their line.  Parsimony did not accord with the generosity and lofty nature of an Antony, yet avarice itself would not deem the portion still remaining insignificant.  Every article is registered.\"  While speaking, she took a manuscript from the hand of Seleukus and passed it to Octavianus who, with a slight bend of the head, received it in silence.  But he had scarcely begun to read it when the steward, a little corpulent man with twinkling eyes half buried in his fat cheeks, raised his short forefinger, pointed insolently at the Queen, and asserted that she was trying to conceal some things, and had ordered him not to place them on the list.  Every tinge of colour faded from the lips and cheeks of the agitated and passionate woman; tortured by feverish impatience and no longer able to control her emotions, she raised herself and, with her own dainty hand, struck the accuser--whom she had lifted from poverty and obscurity to his present high position--again and again in the face, till Octavianus, with a smile of superiority, begged her, much as the man deserved his punishment, to desist.  The unfortunate woman, thus thrown off her guard, flung herself back on her couch and, panting for breath, with tears streaming from her eyes, sobbed aloud, declaring that in the presence of such unendurable insult, such contemptible baseness, she fairly loathed herself.  Then pressing her clenched hands upon her temples, she exclaimed \"Before the eyes of the foe my royal dignity, which I have maintained all my life, falls from me like a borrowed mantle.  Yet what am I?  What shall I be to-morrow, what later?  But who beneath the sun who has warm blood in his veins can preserve his composure when juicy grapes are held before his thirsting lips to be withdrawn, as from Tantalus, ere he can taste them?  You came hither with the assurance of your favour; but the flattering words of promise which you bestowed upon the unhappy woman were probably only the drops of poppy-juice given to soothe the ravings of fever.  Was the favour which you permitted me to see and anticipate for the future merely intended to delude a miserable--\"  But she went no further; Octavianus, with dignified bearing and loud, clear tones, interrupted \"Whoever believes the heir of Caesar capable of shamefully deceiving a noble woman, a queen, the object of his illustrious uncle's love, insults and wounds him; but the just anger which overmastered you may serve as your apology.  Ay,\" he added in a totally different tone, \"I might even have cause to be grateful for this indignation, and to wish for another opportunity to witness the outbreak of passion though in its unbridled fierceness--the royal lioness is scarcely aware of her own beauty when the tempest of wrath sweeps her away.  What must she be when it is love that constrains the flame of her glowing soul to burst into a blaze?\"  \"Her glowing soul!\"  Cleopatra eagerly repeated, and the desire awoke to subjugate this man who had so confidently boasted of his power of resistance.  Though he might be stronger than many others, he certainly was not invincible.  And aware of her still unbroken sway over the hearts of men, her eyes sparkled with the alluring radiance of love, and a bewitching smile brightened her face.  The young Imperator's heart began to chafe under the curb and to beat more quickly, his cheeks flushed and paled by turns.  How she gazed at him!  What if she loved the nephew as she had once loved the uncle who, through her, had learned what bliss life can offer?  Ay, it must be happiness to kiss those lips, to be clasped in those exquisite arms, to hear one's own name tenderly spoken by those musical tones.  Even the magnificent marble statue of Ariadne, which he had seen in Athens, had not displayed to his gaze lines more beautiful than those of the woman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5481"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 09 (#7)"],["body","on yonder pillows.  Who could venture to speak in her presence of vanished charms?  Ah, no!  The spell which had conquered Julius Caesar was as vivid, as potent as ever.  He himself felt its power; he was young, and after such unremitting exertions he too yearned to quaff the nectar of the noblest joys, to steep body and soul in peerless bliss.  So, with a hasty movement, he took one step towards her couch, resolved to grasp her hands and raise them to his lips.  His ardent gaze answered hers; but surprised by the power which, though so heavily burdened with physical and mental suffering, she still possessed over the strongest and coldest of men, she perceived what was passing in his soul, and a smile of triumph, blended with the most bitter contempt, hovered around her beautiful lips.  Should she dupe him into granting her wishes by feigning love for the first time?  Should she yield to the man who had insulted her, in order to induce him to accord the children their rights?  Should she, to gratify her lover's foe, relinquish the sacred grief which was drawing her after him, give posterity and her children the right to call her, instead of the most loyal of the loyal, a dishonoured woman, who sold herself for power?  To all these questions came a prompt denial.  The single stride which Octavianus had made towards her, his eyes aflame with love, gave her the right to feel that she had vanquished the victor, and the proud delight of triumph was too plainly reflected in her mobile features to escape the penetrating, distrustful gaze of the subjugated Caesar.  But he had scarcely perceived what threatened him, and remembered her words concerning his famous uncle's surrender only to her and to death, when he succeeded in conquering his quickly kindled senses.  Blushing at his own weakness, he averted his eyes from the Queen, and when he met those of Proculejus and the other witnesses of the scene, he realized the abyss on whose verge he stood.  He had half succumbed to the danger of losing, by a moment's weakness, the fruit of great sacrifices and severe exertions.  His expressive eyes, which had just rested rapturously upon a beautiful woman, now scanned the spectators with the stern glance of a monarch and, apparently wishing to moderate an excess of flattering recognition which might be misinterpreted, he said in an almost pedagogical tone:  \"Yet we would rather see the noble lioness in the majestic repose which best suits all sovereigns.  It is difficult for a calm, deliberate nature like mine to understand an ardent, quickly kindling heart.\"  Cleopatra had watched this sudden transition with more surprise than disappointment.  Octavianus had half surrendered to her, but recovered his self-command in time, and a man of his temperament does not readily succumb twice to a danger which he barely escaped.  And this was well! He should learn that he had misunderstood the glance which fired his heart; so she answered distantly, with majestic dignity:  \"Misery such as mine quenches all ardour.  And love?  Woman's heart is ever open to it, save where it has lost the desire for power and pleasure.  You are young and happy, therefore your soul still yearns for love--I know that--though not for mine.  To me, on the contrary, one suitor only is welcome, he with the lowered torch, whom you keep aloof from me.  With him alone is to be found the boon for which this soul has longed from childhood--painless peace!  You smile.  My past gives you the right to do so.  I will not lessen it.  Each individual lives his or her own life.  Few understand the changes of their own existence, far less those of a stranger's.  The world has witnessed how Peace fled from my path, or I from hers, and yet I see the possibility of finding the way. I am safe from the only things which would debar me from those joys --humiliation and disgrace.\"  Here she hesitated; then, as if in explanation, continued in the sweetest tones at her command: \"Your generosity, I think, will guard from these two foes the woman whom just now--I did not fail to see it--you considered worthy of a more than gracious glance.  I shall treasure it among memories which will never fade.  But now, illustrious Imperator! tell me, what is your decision concerning me and the children?  What may we hope from your favour?\"  \"That  Octavianus will  be more  and  more warmly animated by the desire to accord you and yours a worthy destiny, the more firmly you expect that he will attest his generosity.\"  \"And if I fulfil this desire and expect from you everything that is great and noble--the condition is not difficult--what proofs of your graciousness will then await us?\"  \"Paint them with all the fervour of that vivid power of imagination which interpreted even my glance in your favour, and devised the marvels by which you rendered the greatest and most brilliant man in Rome the happiest of mortals.  But--by Zeus!--it is the fourth hour after noonday!\"  A glance from the window had caused the exclamation.  Then, pressing his hand upon his heart, he continued in a tone of the most sincere regret \"How gladly I would prolong this fascinating conversation, but important matters which, unfortunately, cannot be deferred, summon me--\"  \"And your answer?\" cried Cleopatra, panting for breath and gazing at him with eyes full of expectation.  \"Must I repeat it?\" he  asked with  impatient haste.  \"Very well, then. In return for implicit confidence on your part, favour, forgiveness, cordiality, every consideration which you can justly desire.  Your heart is so rich in warmth of feeling, grant me but a small share of it and ask tangible gifts in return.  They are already bestowed.\"  Then greeting her like a friend who is reluctant to say farewell, he hastily left the apartment.  \"Gone--gone!\" cried Iras as the door closed behind him.  \"An eel that slips from the hand which strives to hold him.\"  \"Northern ice,\" added Cleopatra gloomily as Charmian aided her to find a more comfortable position.  \"As smooth as it is cold; there is nothing more to hope.\"  \"Yes, my royal mistress, yes,\" Iras eagerly protested.  \"Dolabella is waiting for him in the Philadelphus court-yard.  From him--you have his promise--we shall learn what Octavianus has in store for you.\"  In truth, the Caesar did find the youth at the first gate of the palace, inspecting his superb Cyrenean horses.  \"Magnificent animals!\"  cried Octavianus; \"a gift from the city!  Will you drive with me?--A remarkable, a very remarkable woman!\"  \"Isn't she?\" asked Dolabella eagerly.  \"Undoubtedly,\" replied the Caesar.  \"But though she might almost be your mother, an uncommonly dangerous one for youths of your age.  What a melting voice, what versatility, what fervour!  And yet such regal grace in every movement!  But I wish to stifle, not to fan, the spark which perhaps has already fallen into your heart.  And the play, the farce which she just enacted before me in the midst of most serious matters!\"  He uttered a low, short laugh; but Dolabella exclaimed expectantly: \"You rarely laugh, but this conversation--apparently--excites your mirth. So the result was satisfactory?\"  \"Let us hope so.  I was as gracious to her as possible.\"  \"That is delightful.  May I know in what manner your kindness and wisdom have shaped her future?  Or, rather, what did you promise the vanquished Queen?\"  \"My favour, if she will trust me.\"  \"Proculejus and I will continue to strengthen her confidence.  And if we succeed--?\"  \"Then, as I have said, she will have my favour--a generous abundance of favour.\"  \"But her future destiny?  What fate will you bestow on her and her children?\"  \"Whatever the degree of her confidence deserves.\"  Here he hesitated, for he met Dolabella's earnest, troubled gaze, which was blended with a shade of reproach.  Octavianus desired to retain the enthusiastic admiration of the youth, who perhaps was destined to lofty achievements, so he continued in a confidential tone: \"To you, my young friend, I can venture to speak more frankly.  I will gladly grant the most aspiring wishes of this fascinating and, I repeat, very remarkable woman, but first I need her for my triumph.  The Romans would have cause to reproach me if I deprived them of the sight of this Queen, this peerless woman, in many respects the first of her time.  We shall soon set out for Syria.  The Queen and her children I shall send in three days to Rome.  If, in the triumphal procession there, she creates the sensation I anticipate from a spectacle so worthy of admiration, she shall learn how I reward those who oblige me.\"  Dolabella had listened in silence.  When the Caesar entered the carriage, he requested permission to remain behind.  Octavianus drove alone eastward to the camp where, in the vicinity of the Hippodrome, men were surveying the ground on which the suburb of Nikopolis--city of victory--was to be built to commemorate for future generations the victory of the first Emperor over Antony and Cleopatra. It grew, but never attained any great importance.  The noble Cornelius gazed indignantly after his sovereign's fiery steeds; then, drawing up his stately figure to its full height, he entered the palace with a firm step.  The act might cost him his life, but he would do what he believed to be his duty to the noble woman who had honoured him with her friendship.  This rare sovereign was too good to feast the eyes of the rabble.  A few minutes later Cleopatra knew her impending ignominy.     CHAPTER XXV.  The next morning the Queen had many whispered conversations with Charmian, and the latter with Anukis.  The day before, Archibius's gardener had brought to his master's sister some unusually fine figs, which grew in the old garden of Epicurus.  This fruit was also mentioned, and Anukis went to Kanopus, and thence, in the steward's carriage, with a basket of the very best ones to the fish-market.  There she had a great deal to say to Pyrrhus, and the freedman went"]]]
