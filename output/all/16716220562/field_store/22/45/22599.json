But Parley was not satisfied with even the ancient _gospel form_ without the power.  At the commencement of 1830, the very time the Mormon Church was organized, he felt drawn out in an extraordinary manner to search the prophets, and to pray for an understanding of the same. His prayers were soon answered, even beyond his expectations. The prophesies were opened to his view. He began to understand the things which were about to transpire. The restoration of Israel, the coming of Messiah, and the glory that should follow.  Being now \"moved upon by the Holy Ghost\" to travel about preaching the gospel \"without purse or scrip,\" in August, 1830, he closed his worldly business and bid adieu to his wilderness home, which he never saw afterwards.  \"Arriving at Rochester,\" he says, \"I informed my wife that, notwithstanding our passage being paid through the whole distance, yet I must leave the boat and her to pursue her passage to her friends, while I would stop awhile in this region. Why, I did not know; but so it was plainly manifest by the spirit to me.  \"I said to her, we part for a season; go and visit our friends in our native place; I will come soon, but how soon I know not; for I have a work to do in this region of country, and what it is, or how long it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.  \"My wife would have objected to this, but she had seen the hand of God so plainly manifest in his dealings with me many times, that she dared not oppose the things manifested to me by his spirit. She, therefore, consented; and I accompanied her as far as Newark, a small town upwards of one hundred miles from Buffalo, and then took leave of her, and of the boat.  \"It was early in the morning, just at the dawn of day; I walked ten miles into the country, and stopped to breakfast with a Mr. Wells. I proposed to preach in the evening. Mr. Wells readily accompanied me through the neighborhood to visit the people, and circulate the appointment.  \"We visited an old Baptist deacon, by the name of Hamlin. After hearing of our appointment for the evening, he began to tell of a book, a strange book, a very strange book, in his possession, which had been just published. This book, he said, purported to have been originally written on plates, either of gold or brass, by a branch of the tribes of Israel; and to have been discovered and translated by a young man near Palmyra, in the State of New York, by the aid of visions, or the ministry of angels.  \"I inquired of him how or where the book was to be obtained. He promised me the perusal of it, at his house the next day, if I would call. I felt a strange interest in the book.  \"Next morning I called at his house, where for the first time my eyes beheld the Book of Mormon,--that book of books--that record which reveals the antiquities of the 'new world' back to the remotest ages, and which unfolds the destiny of its people and the world, for all time to come.\"  As he read, the spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he knew and comprehended that the book was true; whereupon he resolved to visit the young man who was the instrument in bringing forth this \"marvelous work.\"  Accordingly he visited the village of Palmyra, and inquired for the residence of Mr. Joseph Smith, which he found some two or three miles from the village. As he approached the house, at the close of the day, he overtook a man driving some cows, and inquired of him for \"Mr. Joseph Smith, the translator of the Book of Mormon.\" This man was none other than Hyrum, Joseph's brother, who informed him that Joseph then resided in Pennsylvania, some one hundred miles distant. That night Parley was entertained by Hyrum, who explained to him much of the great Israelitish mission just opening to the world.  In the morning he was compelled to take leave of Hyrum, the brother, who at parting presented him with a copy of the Book of Mormon. He had not then completed its perusal, and so after traveling on a few miles he stopped to rest and again commenced to read the book. To his great joy he found that Jesus Christ, in his glorified resurrected body, had appeared to the \"remnant of Joseph\" on the continent of America, soon after his resurrection and ascension into heaven; and that he also administered, in person, to the ten lost tribes; and that through his personal ministry in these countries his gospel was revealed and written in countries and among nations entirely unknown to the Jewish apostles.  Having rested awhile and perused the sacred book by the roadside, he again walked on.  After fulfilling his appointments, he resolved to preach no more until he had duly received a \"commission from on high.\" So he returned to Hyrum, who journeyed with him some twenty-five miles to the residence of Mr. Whitmer, in Seneca County, who was one of the \"witnesses\" of the Book of Mormon, and in whose chamber much of the book was translated.  He found the little branch of the church in that place \"full of joy, faith, humility and charity.\"  They rested that night, and on the next day (the 1st of September, 1830), Parley was baptized by Oliver Cowdery, who, with the prophet Joseph, had been ordained \"under the hands\" of the angel John the Baptist to this ministry,--the same John who baptized Jesus Christ in the River Jordan.  A meeting of these primitive saints was held the same evening, when Parley was confirmed with the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ordained an elder of the church.  Feeling now that he had the true authority to preach, he commenced his new ministry under the authority and power which the angels had conferred. \"The Holy Ghost,\" he says, \"came upon me mightily. I spoke the word of God with power, reasoning out of the scriptures and the Book of Mormon. The people were convinced, overwhelmed with tears, and came forward expressing their faith, and were baptized.\"  The mysterious object for which he took leave of his wife was realized, and so he pursued his journey to the land of his fathers, and of his boyhood.  He now commenced his labors in good earnest, daily addressing crowded audiences; and soon he baptized his brother Orson, a youth of nineteen, but to-day a venerable apostle--the Paul of Mormondom.  It was during his labors in these parts, in the Autumn of 1830, that he saw a very singular and extraordinary sign in the heavens.  He had been on a visit to the people called Shakers, at New Lebanon, and was returning on foot, on a beautiful evening of September. The sky was without a cloud; the stars shone out beautifully, and all nature seemed reposing in quiet, as he pursued his solitary way, wrapt in deep meditations on the predictions of the holy prophets; the signs of the times; the approaching advent of the Messiah to reign on the earth, and the important revelations of the Book of Mormon, when his attention was aroused by a sudden appearance of a brilliant light which shone around him \"above the brightness of the sun.\" He cast his eyes upwards to inquire from whence the light came, when he perceived a long chain of light extending in the heavens, very bright and of a deep fiery red. It at first stood stationary in a horizontal position; at length bending in the centre, the two ends approached each other with a rapid movement so as to form an exact square. In this position it again remained stationary for some time, perhaps a minute, and then again the ends approached each other with the same rapidity, and again ceased to move, remaining stationary, for perhaps a minute, in the form of a compass. It then commenced a third movement in the same manner, and closed like the closing of a compass, the whole forming a straight line like a chain doubled. It again remained stationary a minute, and then faded away.  \"I fell upon my knees in the street,\" he says, \"and thanked the Lord for so marvelous a sign of the coming of the Son of Man. Some persons may smile at this, and say that all these exact movements were by chance; but for my part I could as soon believe that the alphabet would be formed by chance and be placed so as to spell my name, as to believe that these signs (known only to the wise) could be formed and shown forth by chance.\"  Parley now made his second visit to the prophet, who had returned from Pennsylvania to his father's residence in Manchester, near Palmyra, and here had the pleasure of seeing him for the first time.  It was now October, 1830. A revelation had been given through the mouth of the prophet in which elders Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, Tiber Peterson and Parley P. Pratt were appointed to go into the wilderness through the Western States, and to the Indian Territory.  These elders journeyed until they came to the spiritual pastorate of Sydney Rigdon, in Ohio. He received the elders cordially, and Parley presented his former friend and instructor with the Book of Mormon, and related to him the history of the same.  \"The news of our coming,\" says Parley, \"was soon noised abroad, and the news of the discovery of the Book of Mormon and the marvelous events connected with it. The interest and excitement now became general in Kirtland, and in all the region round about. The people thronged us night and day, insomuch that we had no time for rest or retirement. Meetings were convened in different neighborhoods, and multitudes came together soliciting our attendance; while thousands flocked about us daily, some to be taught, some for curiosity, some to obey the gospel, and some to dispute or resist it.  \"In two or three weeks from our arrival in the neighborhood with the news, we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls; and this number soon increased to one thousand. The disciples were filled with joy and gladness; while rage and lying was abundantly manifested by gainsayers. Faith was strong, joy was great, and persecution heavy.  \"We proceeded to ordain Sidney Rigdon, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],["title","Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#0)"],["body","(https://mormontextsproject.org/), with thanks to Andy Hobbs and Shawnee Hawkes.       REMINISCENCES  OF  JOSEPH, THE PROPHET,  AND THE COMING FORTH OF  THE BOOK OF MORMON.  BY ELDER EDWARD STEVENSON,  Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  ILLUSTRATED.  SALT LAKE CITY:  PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR.  1893.  [Image: Edward Stevenson, Born May 1st, 1820, at Gibraltar, Spain.]    PREFACE.  In presenting this pamphlet of Reminiscences to the public, the Author desires to explain the circumstances that induced him to issue it. While delivering a series of illustrated lectures in the various tabernacles and public halls throughout the Territory--and which were repeated on more than 200 different occasions--the Author was earnestly solicited to publish the lectures, including engravings of the paintings, in the form in which they now appear.  Having become convinced from the great interest taken in the lectures, that they were productive of much good, the Author finally determined to submit the lectures to the public.  The Author having been personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and having been with him in many of his trying experiences, desires to add his testimony to the truth of the work inaugurated by him, under instructions from the Almighty, and hopes that the incidents herein related will induce many to investigate this great and important work; for he that judgeth without investigation is unwise.  Respectfully, THE AUTHOR.    REMINISCENCES OF JOSEPH THE PROPHET   CHAPTER I.  The Mighty Messenger of the Latter-day Dispensation.--A Brief Record of a Life fraught with Matchless Heroism, under all manner of Persecution, Trials, Imprisonment, Hardships and finally Martyrdom.  [Image: Joseph Smith, the Prophet.]  The picture herewith presented is one of the few produced of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is here reproduced from one published in Harper's Pictorial many years ago and now makes its appearance for the second time. Although it is only a wood cut, there are in it some true lines and features of the Prophet when he was about the age of twenty-six. At this early period the science of photography was but in its infancy and pictures of prominent men were neither so correct nor plentiful as at the present time. It is, indeed, very proper and desirable to preserve the best pictures of those who have proven themselves the benefactors of our country, and more especially so of him who was chosen and ordained of God to give light and truth and eternal blessings to mankind.  Of the few likenesses of our martyred Prophet placed before the public, there has been one presented by his son (Joseph Smith, Jr.), which purports to be a copy or fac simile of a painting which was evidently taken when he was quite young. It is a front view and, in some respects, bears a striking resemblance to the one we present to our readers, notwithstanding that ours is a side view.  Many efforts have been made to obtain a good portrait, but, it is to be regretted, without satisfactory results. Brother Nathan T. Porter, of Centerville, Davis County, Utah, who first saw Joseph Smith in Jackson County, Mo., in the year 1831, is very much pleased with this picture, and so also is Aunt Zina D. H. Young, who sees in it many striking features of the youthful Prophet.  I first saw him in 1834 at Pontiac and the impression made upon my mind by him at that time causes me now much pleasure in presenting the picture to his many friends. The love for him, as a true Prophet of God, was indelibly impressed upon my mind, and has always been with me from that time, although nearly sixty years have since passed away.  In that same year, 1834, in the midst of many large congregations, the Prophet testified with great power concerning the visit of the Father and the Son, and the conversation he had with them. Never before did I feel such power as was manifested on these occasions, and, although only a small percentage of those who saw and heard him accepted the restored Gospel, there was not one who dared to dispute it. Many of our neighbors were heard to say: \"Well, if Mormonism is true, it will stand; if not true, it will fall.\" Many of them lived to see it stand and increase, and while they themselves passed away in death's embrace, the work continued to flourish and prosper.  The fact that so few received his testimony caused me, for a time, to greatly marvel. But when I looked back to the period when Jesus and His chosen Twelve and Seventies labored, with all their might, for the salvation of a fallen world, even with all manner of signs following their labors, and saw how few believed in our embraced their testimony in that day of mighty power, when even the grave was robbed of its victims and the dead commanded to come forth and live, and that while the dead lived the living were dead; yea, when I saw and meditated upon these things, I became somewhat reconciled, and the words of the Lord, through Jeremiah, recurred to my mind and I was satisfied. The words were these, \"And I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.\"--Jer. 3. chap. 14, 15. After these lessons I learned that while the Gospel was free to every one, yet every one was not free to receive the Gospel.  While thus speaking of the Prophet's visit to Pontiac, Oakland County, Michigan (then a Territory), I cannot pass by the predictions which he then made and which were afterwards literally fulfilled as witnessed by myself and many others. Joseph said, \"If you will obey the Gospel with honest hearts, I promise you in the name of the Lord, that the gifts as promised by our Saviour will follow you, and by this you may prove me to be a true servant of God.\"  I am, with others, a witness that these gifts did follow many in the branch of the Church which was raised up in Pontiac. Among them were Deacon Bent of the Presbyterian Church, who was the first one baptized (and who afterwards became President of the High Council in Nauvoo). His daughter Mary was the first one who spoke in tongues in this branch. Besides Mary Curtis, Joseph Wood, Elijah Fordham and others also enjoyed that gift. We felt that we were blessed above kings, rulers and potentates of the earth and truly we were a happy branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Our souls were full of joyous thanksgiving, and our songs of gladness rejoiced the heart by day, dispelled the gloom of night and welcomed the coming morn. Those only can realize our happiness and delight who sing with the soul and understanding the beautiful song of Zion:   We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, To guide us in these latter days;  We thank Thee for sending the Gospel To lighten our minds with its  rays.  The above named Mary Curtis, who afterwards became Sister Reed, will be remembered as the lady who spoke in tongues in the Logan Temple about three years ago, on a fast day, and who, on that same day, after having completed her day's work in the Temple, went home in the evening and died. Lyman O. Littlefield, of Logan, as well as myself and my Sister Mary Stevenson Clark, of Farmington, Davis Co., Utah, witnessed the speaking in tongues by Mary Curtis in Michigan, sixty years ago, and also on this occasion in Logan Temple.  These, however, were not the only blessings with which we were favored in the Pontiac branch, for we enjoyed the presence of the venerable and venerated father of the Prophet (Joseph Smith, Sen.), the Patriarch of the whole Church of God on the earth. The writer was one of many who, under his hands, received choice and rare blessings, when the power of the Holy Ghost filled the house to such an extent that the tears flowed down the cheeks of even those who lived and died outside of the pale of the Church.  Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris were also heard by the writer to testify that they, in open day, stood in the presence of the God who ministered unto the Prophet. And indeed there was a power accompanying these testimonies which was irresistible, and which made deep and lasting impressions.  Although a mere humble widow's son, I felt proud and blessed of God, when he honored us by coming under our roof and partaking of our hospitality. Oh! how my heart swelled with delightful emotions of heavenly love, as I selected and presented to him some of our choice apples in exchange for the golden nuggets of celestial truth, which he bestowed upon us as he partook of the humble but hearty hospitality of a widow's table! We were proud, indeed, to entertain one who had conversed with the Father and the Son, and been under the tuition of an angel from Heaven, and who, under the immediate direction of the Almighty, had organized the true church on the earth, after the exact pattern of that organized by God, through Jesus Christ, eighteen hundred years before.  In parting from under our roof the Prophet expressed a desire to have a loan of a large English Book of Martyrs which we possessed, promising to return it to us when he should meet us again in Zion, in the State of Missouri, which he did, and on returning it he said, \"I have, by the aid of the Urim and Thummim, seen those martyrs, and they were honest, devoted followers of Christ, according to the light they possessed, and they will be saved.\"  For the benefit of those who have not been privileged to meet our beloved martyred Prophet, I deem it a favor to present the picture, with the incidents here narrated, for the pleasure and consideration of all who may peruse them.  Joseph Smith was born December 23rd, 1805, in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont. At about the age of eight years, he passed through an ordeal which gave remarkable evidence of heroic fortitude and indomitable power of will, under intense bodily suffering.
