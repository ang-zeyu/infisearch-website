Take it--but do not look at me like that any longer, for I cannot bear it!\"  \"I do not want it,\" said her sister, but not sharply; then, looking down, she asked in a low voice: \"Did the Roman keep the violets?\"  \"He kept--no, Klea--I will not tell you a lie!  He flung them over the house, and said such rough things as he did it, that I was frightened and turned my back upon him quickly, for I felt the tears coming into my eyes.  What have you to do with the Roman?  I feel so anxious, so frightened--as I do sometimes when a storm is gathering and I am afraid of it.  And how pale your lips are!  that comes of long fasting, no doubt --eat now, as much as you can.  But Klea!  why do you look at me so--and look so gloomy and terrible?  I cannot bear that look, I cannot bear it!\"  Irene sobbed aloud, and her sister went up to her, stroked her soft hair from her brow, kissed her kindly, and said:  \"I am not angry with you, child, and did not mean to hurt you.  If only I could cry as you do when clouds overshadow my heart, the blue sky would shine again with me as soon as it does with you.  Now dry your eyes, go up to the temple, and enquire at what hour we are to go to the singing- practice, and when the procession is to set out.\"  Irene obeyed; she went out with downcast eyes, but once out she looked up again brightly, for she remembered the procession, and it occurred to her that she would then see again the Roman's gay acquaintance, and turning back into the room she laid her pomegranate-blossom in the little bowl out of which she had formerly taken the violets, kissed her sister as gaily as ever, and then reflected as to whether she would wear the flower in her hair or in her bosom.  Wear it, at any rate, she must, for she must show plainly that she knew how to value such a gift.  As soon as Klea was alone she seized the trencher with a vehement gesture, gave the roast bird to the gray cat, who had stolen back into the room, turning away her head, for the mere smell of the pheasant was like an insult.  Then, while the cat bore off her welcome spoils into a corner, she clutched a peach and raised her hand to fling it away through a gap in the roof of the room; but she did not carry out her purpose, for it occurred to her that Irene and little Philo, the son of the gate- keeper, might enjoy the luscious fruit; so she laid it back on the dish and took up the bread, for she was painfully hungry.  She was on the point of breaking the golden-brown cake, but acting on a rapid impulse she tossed it back on the trencher saying to herself: \"At any rate I will owe him nothing; but I will not throw away the gifts of the gods as he threw away my violets, for that would be a sin.  All is over between him and me, and if he appears to-day in the procession, and if he chooses to look at me again I will compel my eyes to avoid meeting his--aye, that I will, and will carry it through.  But, Oh eternal gods! and thou above all, great Serapis, whom I heartily serve, there is another thing I cannot do without your aid.  Help me, oh! help me to forget him, that my very thoughts may remain pure.\"  With these words she flung herself on her knees before the chest, pressed her brow against the hard wood, and strove to pray.  Only for one thing did she entreat the gods; for strength to forget the man who had betrayed her into losing her peace of mind.  But just as swift clouds float across the sky, distracting the labors of the star-gazer, who is striving to observe some remote planet--as the clatter of the street interrupts again and again some sweet song we fain would hear, marring it with its harsh discords--so again and again the image of the young Roman came across Klea's prayers for release from that very thought, and at last it seemed to her that she was like a man who strives to raise a block of stone by the exertion of his utmost strength, and who weary at last of lifting the stone is crushed to the earth by its weight; still she felt that, in spite of all her prayers and efforts, the enemy she strove to keep off only came nearer, and instead of flying from her, overmastered her soul with a grasp from which she could not escape.  Finally she gave up the unavailing struggle, cooled her burning face with cold water, and tightened the straps of her sandals to go to the temple; near the god himself she hoped she might in some degree recover the peace she could not find here.  Just at the door she met Irene, who told her that the singing-practice was put off, on account of the procession which was fixed for four hours after noon.  And as Klea went towards the temple her sister called after her.  \"Do not stay too long though, water will be wanted again directly for the libations.\"  \"Then will you go alone to the work?\" asked Klea; \"there cannot be very much wanted, for the temple will soon be empty on account of the procession.  A few jars-full will be enough.  There is a cake of bread and a peach in there for you; I must keep the other for little Philo.\"     CHAPTER IV.  Klea went quickly on towards the temple, without listening to Irene's excuses.  She paid no heed to the worshippers who filled the forecourt, praying either with heads bent low or with uplifted arms or, if they were of Egyptian extraction, kneeling on the smooth stone pavement, for, even as she entered, she had already begun to turn in supplication to the divinity.  She crossed the great hall of the sanctuary, which was open only to the initiated and to the temple-servants, of whom she was one.  Here all around her stood a crowd of slender columns, their shafts crowned with gracefully curved flower calyxes, like stems supporting lilies, over her head she saw in the ceiling an image of the midnight sky with the bright, unresting and ever-restful stars; the planets and fixed stars in their golden barks looked down on her silently.  Yes! here were the twilight and stillness befitting a personal communion with the divinity.  The pillars appeared to her fancy like a forest of giant growth, and it seemed to her that the perfume of the incense emanated from the gorgeous floral capitals that crowned them; it penetrated her senses, which were rendered more acute by fasting and agitation, with a sort of intoxication.  Her eyes were raised to heaven, her arms crossed over her bosom as she traversed this vast hall, and with trembling steps approached a smaller and lower chamber, where in the furthest and darkest background a curtain of heavy and costly material veiled the brazen door of the holy of holies.  Even she was forbidden to approach this sacred place; but to-day she was so filled with longing for the inspiring assistance of the god, that she went on to the holy of holies in spite of the injunction she had never yet broken, not to approach it.  Filled with reverent awe she sank down close to the door of the sacred chamber, shrinking close into the angle formed between a projecting door-post and the wall of the great hall.  The craving desire to seek and find a power outside us as guiding the path of our destiny is common to every nation, to every man; it is as surely innate in every being gifted with reason--many and various as these are--as the impulse to seek a cause when we perceive an effect, to see when light visits the earth, or to hear when swelling waves of sound fall on our ear.  Like every other gift, no doubt that of religious sensibility is bestowed in different degrees on different natures. In Klea it had always been strongly developed, and a pious mother had cultivated it by precept and example, while her father always had taught her one thing only: namely to be true, inexorably true, to others as to herself.  Afterwards she had been daily employed in the service of the god whom she was accustomed to regard as the greatest and most powerful of all the immortals, for often from a distance she had seen the curtain of the sanctuary pushed aside, and the statue of Serapis with the Kalathos on his head, and a figure of Cerberus at his feet, visible in the half-light of the holy of holies; and a ray of light, flashing through the darkness as by a miracle, would fall upon his brow and kiss his lips when his goodness was sung by the priests in hymns of praise.  At other times the tapers by the side of the god would be lighted or extinguished spontaneously.  Then, with the other believers, she would glorify the great lord of the other world, who caused a new sun to succeed each that was extinguished, and made life grow up out of death; who resuscitated the dead, lifting them up to be equal with him, if on earth they had reverenced truth and were found faithful by the judges of the nether world.  Truth--which her father had taught her to regard as the best possession of life--was rewarded by Serapis above all other virtues; hearts were weighed before him in a scale against truth, and whenever Klea tried to picture the god in human form he wore the grave and mild features of her father, and she fancied him speaking in the words and tones of the man to whom she owed her being, who had been too early snatched from her, who had endured so much for righteousness' sake, and from whose lips she had never heard a single word that might not have beseemed the god himself. And, as she crouched closely in the dark angle by the holy of holies, she felt herself nearer to her father as well as to the god, and accused"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5461"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 1 (#7)"],["body","pitilessly, in that unmaidenly longings had stirred her heart, that she had been insincere to herself and Irene, nay in that if she could not succeed in tearing the image of the Roman from her heart she would be compelled either to deceive her sister or to sadden the innocent and careless nature of the impressionable child, whom she was accustomed to succor and cherish as a mother might.  On her, even apparently light matters weighed oppressively, while Irene could throw off even grave and serious things, blowing them off as it were into the air, like a feather. She was like wet clay on which even the light touch of a butterfly leaves a mark, her sister like a mirror from which the breath that has dimmed it instantly and entirely vanishes.  \"Great God!\"  she murmured in her prayer, \"I feel as if the Roman had branded my very soul.  Help thou me to efface the mark; help me to become as I was before, so that I may look again in Irene's eyes without concealment, pure and true, and that I may be able to say to myself, as I was wont, that I had thought and acted in such a way as my father would approve if he could know it.\"  She was still praying thus when the footsteps and voices of two men approaching the holy of holies startled her from her devotions; she suddenly became fully conscious of the fact that she was in a forbidden spot, and would be severely punished if she were discovered.  \"Lock that door,\" cried one of the new-comers to his companion, pointing to the door which led from the prosekos into the pillared hall, \"none, even of the initiated, need see what you are preparing here for us--\"  Klea recognized the voice of the high-priest, and thought for a moment of stepping forward and confessing her guilt; but, though she did not usually lack courage, she did not do this, but shrank still more closely into her hiding-place, which was perfectly dark when the brazen door of the room; which had no windows, was closed.  She now perceived that the curtain and door were opened which closed the inmost sanctuary, she heard one of the men twirling the stick which was to produce fire, saw the first gleam of light from it streaming out of the holy of holies, and then heard the blows of a hammer and the grating sound of a file.  The quiet sanctum was turned into a forge, but noisy as were the proceedings within, it seemed to Klea that the beating of her own heart was even louder than the brazen clatter of the tools wielded by Krates; he was one of the oldest of the priests of Serapis, who was chief in charge of the sacred vessels, who was wont never to speak to any one but the high-priest, and who was famous even among his Greek fellow- countrymen for the skill with which he could repair broken metal-work, make the securest locks, and work in silver and gold.  When the sisters first came into the temple five years since, Irene had been very much afraid of this man, who was so small as almost to be a dwarf, broad shouldered and powerfully knit, while his wrinkled face looked like a piece of rough cork-bark, and he was subject to a painful complaint in his feet which often prevented his walking; her fears had not vexed but only amused the priestly smith, who whenever he met the child, then eleven years old, would turn his lips up to his big red nose, roll his eyes, and grunt hideously to increase the terror that came over her.  He was not ill-natured, but he had neither wife nor child, nor brother, nor sister, nor friend, and every human being so keenly desires that others should have some feeling about him, that many a one would rather be feared than remain unheeded.  After Irene had got over her dread she would often entreat the old man-- who was regarded as stern and inaccessible by all the other dwellers in the temple--in her own engaging and coaxing way to make a face for her, and he would do it and laugh when the little one, to his delight and her own, was terrified at it and ran away; and just lately when Irene, having hurt her foot, was obliged to keep her room for a few days, an unheard of thing had occurred: he had asked Klea with the greatest sympathy how her sister was getting on, and had given her a cake for her.  While Krates was at his work not a word passed between him and the high- priest.  At length he laid down the hammer, and said:  \"I do not much like work of this kind, but this, I think, is successful at any rate.  Any temple-servant, hidden here behind the altar, can now light or extinguish the lamps without the illusion being detected by the sharpest.  Go now and stand at the door of the great hall and speak the word.\"  Klea heard the high-priest accede to this request and cry in a chanting voice: \"Thus he commands the night and it becomes day, and the extinguished taper and lo! it flames with brightness.  If indeed thou art nigh, Oh Serapis! manifest thyself to us.\"  At these words a bright stream of light flashed from the holy of holies, and again was suddenly extinguished when the high-priest sang: \"Thus showest thou thyself as light to the children of truth, but dost punish with darkness the children of lies.\"  \"Again?\"  asked Krates in a voice which conveyed a desire that the answer might be 'No.'  \"I must trouble you,\" replied the high-priest.  \"Good! the performance went much better this time.  I was always well assured of your skill; but consider the particular importance of this affair.  The two kings and the queen will probably be present at the solemnity, certainly Philometor and Cleopatra will, and their eyes are wide open; then the Roman who has already assisted four times at the procession will accompany them, and if I judge him rightly he, like many of the nobles of his nation, is one of those who can trust themselves when it is necessary to be content with the old gods of their fathers; and as regards the marvels we are able to display to them, they do not take them to heart like the poor in spirit, but measure and weigh them with a cool and unbiassed mind.  People of that stamp, who are not ashamed to worship, who do not philosophize but only think just so much as is necessary for acting rightly, those are the worst contemners of every supersensual manifestation.\"  \"And the students of nature in the Museum?\"  asked Krates.  \"They believe nothing to be real that they cannot see and observe.\"  \"And for that very reason,\" replied the high-priest, \"they are often singularly easy to deceive by your skill, since, seeing an effect without a cause, they are inclined to regard the invisible cause as something supersensual.  Now, open the door again and let us get out by the side door; do you, this time, undertake the task of cooperating with Serapis yourself.  Consider that Philometor will not confirm the donation of the land unless he quits the temple deeply penetrated by the greatness of our god.  Would it be possible, do you think, to have the new censer ready in time for the birthday of King Euergetes, which is to be solemnly kept at Memphis?\"  \"We will see,\" replied Krates, \"I must first put together the lock of the great door of the tomb of Apis, for so long as I have it in my workshop any one can open it who sticks a nail into the hole above the bar, and any one can shut it inside who pushes the iron bolt.  Send to call me before the performance with the lights begins; I will come in spite of my wretched feet.  As I have undertaken the thing I will carry it out, but for no other reason, for it is my opinion that even without such means of deception--\"  \"We use no deception,\" interrupted the high-priest, sternly rebuking his colleague.  \"We only present to short-sighted mortals the creative power of the divinity in a form perceptible and intelligible to their senses.\"  With these words the tall priest turned his back on the smith and quitted the hall by a side door; Krates opened the brazen door, and as he gathered together his tools he said to himself, but loud enough for Klea to hear him distinctly in her hiding-place:  \"It may be right for me, but deceit is deceit, whether a god deceives a king or a child deceives a beggar.\"  \"Deceit is deceit,\" repeated Klea after the smith when he had left the hall and she had emerged from her corner.  She stood still for a moment and looked round her.  For the first time she observed the shabby colors on the walls, the damage the pillars had sustained in the course of years, and the loose slabs in the pavement.  The sweetness of the incense sickened her, and as she passed by an old man who threw up his arms in fervent supplication, she looked at him with a glance of compassion.  When she had passed out beyond the pylons enclosing the temple she turned round, shaking her head in a puzzled way as she gazed at it; for she knew that not a stone had been changed within the last hour, and yet it looked as strange in her eyes as some landscape with which we have become familiar in all the beauty of spring, and see once more in winter with its trees bare of leaves; or like the face of a woman which we thought beautiful under the veil which hid it, and which, when the veil is raised, we see to be wrinkled and devoid of charm.  When she had heard the smith's words, \"Deceit is deceit,\" she felt her heart shrink as from a stab, and could not check the tears which started to her eyes, unused as they were to weeping; but as soon as she had repeated the stern verdict with her own lips her tears had ceased, and now she stood looking at the temple like a traveller who takes leave of a dear friend; she was excited, she breathed more freely, drew herself up taller, and then turned her back on the sanctuary of Serapis, proudly though with a sore heart.  Close to the gate-keeper's lodge a child came tottering towards her with his arms stretched up to her.  She lifted him up, kissed him, and then asked the mother, who also greeted her, for a piece of bread, for her hunger was becoming intolerable.  While she ate the dry morsel the child sat on her lap,"]]]
