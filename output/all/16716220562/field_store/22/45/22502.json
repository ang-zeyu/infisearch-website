He was pushed away.  \"Come, Silas,\" he said.  \"No!\" cried the Judge, and with this effort he slipped back again. Those who stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on Judge Whipple's face.  But the lips were firmly closed, bidding defiance, as ever, to the world. The Colonel, stroking his goatee, regarded him curiously.  \"Silas,\" he said slowly, \"if you won't drink it for me, perhaps you will drink it--for--Abraham--Lincoln.\"  The two who watched that scene have never forgotten it. Outside, in the great cool store, the rattle of the trucks was heard, and Mr. Hopper giving commands. Within was silence. The straight figure of the Colonel towered above the sofa while he waited. A full minute passed. Once Judge Whipple's bony hand opened and shut, and once his features worked. Then, without warning, he sat up.  \"Colonel,\" said he, \"I reckon I wouldn't be much use to Abe if I took that. But if you'll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--\"  Mr. Carvel set the glass down. In two strides he had reached the door and given the order. Then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa.  Stephen found his mother at breakfast. He had forgotten the convention He told her what had happened at Mr. Carvel's store, and how the Colonel had tried to persuade Judge Whipple to take the Glencoe house while he was in Europe, and how the Judge had refused. Tears were in the widow's eyes when Stephen finished.  \"And he means to stay here in the heat and go through, the campaign?\" she asked.  \"He says that he will not stir.\"  \"It will kill him, Stephen,\" Mrs. Brice faltered.  \"So the Colonel told him. And he said that he would die willingly--after Abraham Lincoln was elected. He had nothing to live for but to fight for that. He had never understood the world, and had quarrelled with at all his life.\"  'He said that to Colonel Carvel?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Stephen!\"  He didn't dare to look at his mother, nor she at him. And when he reached the office, half an hour later, Mr. Whipple was seated in his chair, defiant and unapproachable. Stephen sighed as he settled down to his work. The thought of one who might have accomplished what her father could not was in his head. She was at Monticello.  Some three weeks later Mr. Brinsmade's buggy drew up at Mrs. Brice's door. The Brinsmade family had been for some time in the country. And frequently, when that gentleman was detained in town by business, he would stop at the little home for tea. The secret of the good man's visit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward.  \"I fear that it will be a hot summer, ma'am,\" he had said to Mrs. Brice. \"You should go to the country.\"  \"The heat agrees with me remarkably, Mr. Brinsmade,\" said the lady, smiling.  \"I have heard that Colonel Carvel wishes to rent his house at Glencoe,\" Mr. Brinsmade continued, \"The figure is not high.\" He mentioned it. And it was, indeed nominal. \"It struck me that a change of air would do you good, Mrs. Brice, and Stephen. Knowing that you shared in our uneasiness concerning Judge Whipple, I thought--\"  He stopped, and looked at her. It was a hard task even for that best and roost tactful of gentlemen, Mr. Brinsmade. He too had misjudged this calm woman.  \"I understand you, Mr. Brinsmade,\" she said. She saw, as did Stephen, the kindness behind the offer--Colonel Carvel's kindness and his own. The gentleman's benevolent face brightened:  \"And, my dear Madam, do not let the thought of this little house trouble you. It was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer. If we could induce the Judge to go to Glencoe with you for the summer; I am sure it would be a relief for us all.\"  He did not press the matter; but begged Stephen to call on him in a day or two, at the bank.  \"What do you think, Stephen,\" asked his mother, when Mr. Brinsmade was gone, Stephen did not reply at once. What, indeed, could he say? The vision of that proud figure of Miss Virginia was before him, and he revolted. What was kindness from Colonel Carvel and Mr. Brinsmade was charity from her. He could not bear the thought of living in a house haunted by her. And yet why should he let his pride and his feelings stand in the way of the health--perhaps of the life--of Judge Whipple?  It was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the subject again that evening. Stephen did not sleep in the hot night. But when he rose in the morning he had made up his mind. After breakfast he went straight to the Colonel's store, and fortunately found. Mr. Carvel at his desk, winding up his affairs.  The next morning, when the train for the East pulled out of Illinoistown, Miss Jinny Carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving good-by to a knot of friends. She was leaving for Europe. Presently she went into the sleeping-car to join the Colonel, who wore a gray liners duster. For a long time she sat gazing at the young, corn waving on the prairie, fingering the bunch of June roses on her lap. Clarence had picked them only a few hours ago, in the dew at Bellegarde. She saw her cousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds, just as she had left him. She pictured him riding out the Bellefontaine Road that afternoon, alone. Now that the ocean was to be between them, was it love that she felt for Clarence at last? She glanced at her father. Once or twice she had suspected him of wishing to separate them. Her Aunt Lillian, indeed, had said as much, and Virginia had silenced her. But when she had asked the Colonel to take Clarence to Europe, he had refused. And yet she knew that he had begged Captain Lige to go.  Virginia had been at home but a week. She had seen the change in Clarence and exulted. The very first day she had surprised him on the porch at Bellegarde with \"Hardee's tactics\". From a boy Clarence had suddenly become a man with a Purpose,--and that was the Purpose of the South.  \"They have dared to nominate that dirty Lincoln,\" he said.--\"Do you think that we will submit to nigger equality rule? Never! never!\" he cried. \"If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until my legs are shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the ground.\"  Virginia's heart had leaped within her at the words, and into her eyes had flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in vain. He had the carriage of a soldier, the animation and endurance of the thoroughbred when roused. He was of the stuff that made the resistance of the South the marvel of the world. And well we know, whatever the sound of it, that his speech was not heroics. Nor was it love for his cousin that inspired it, save in this: he had apotheosized Virginia. To him she was the inspired goddess of the South--his country. His admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar. Her ambition for him he felt was likewise the South's ambition for him.  His mother, Virginia's aunt, felt this too, and strove against it with her feeble might. She never had had power over her son; nor over any man, save the temporal power of beauty. And to her mortification she found herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her daughter. So in Virginia's presence she became more trivial and petty than ever. It was her one defence.  It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join Company A. Few young men of family did not. And now he ran to his room to don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high bearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and the gorgeous, priceless shackle. Indeed, the boy looked stunning. He held his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high resolve there was no mistaking. The high color of her pride was on the cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his mistress. And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses awaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless determination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her in the summer house at Glencoe. Strive as she might against the thought, deny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the face of the North. Her patriotism and all that was in her of race rebelled. To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and Clarence's. Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried out aloud that it was not inflexible.  And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the prairie, the memory of this was bitter within her.  Suddenly she turned to her father.  \"Did you rent our house at Glencoe?\" she asked.  \"No, Jinny.\"  \"I suppose Mr. Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent, even to save Mr, Whipple's life.\"  The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise. She was leaning back on the seat, her eyes half closed.  \"Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it. I always had a fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than ever before. It was I who insulted them by naming that rent.\"  \"What did he do?\" Virginia demanded.  \"He came to my office yesterday morning. 'Colonel Carvel,' said he, 'I hear you wish to rent your house.' I said yes. 'You rented it once before, sir,' said he. 'Yes,' said I. 'May I ask you what price you got for it?' said he.\"  \"And what did you say?\" she asked, leaning forward.  \"I told him,\" said the Colonel, smiling. \"But I explained that I could not expect to command that price now on short notice. He replied that they would pay it, or not consider the place.\"  Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.  \"How could they afford it!\" she murmured.  \"Mr. Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case last winter, and since then has had some practice. And that he writes for the newspapers. I believe he declined some sort of an editorial position, preferring to remain at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5391"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 04 (#5)"],["body"," law.\"  \"And so they are going into the house?\" she asked presently.  \"No,\" said the Colonel. \"Whipple refused point-blank to go to the country. He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life likely to be worth anything. So the Brices remain in town.\"  Colonel Carvel sighed. But Virginia said nothing.     CHAPTER X.  RICHTER'S SCAR  This was the summer when Mr. Stephen Brice began to make his appearance in public. The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise, although they were not all so. It was at a little town on the outskirts of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to listen.  In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of advice which Mr. Lincoln had given him. \"Speak so that the lowest may understand, and the rest will have no trouble.\" And it had worked. At the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately wide of the mark. After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his audience, --especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in the rear, out of sight of the stand. This may have been Judge Whipple, although we have no proof of the fact.  Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech. He laughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it was. I have no doubt that many of the master's phrases slipped in, as young Mr. Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union speech by heart. He had caught more than the phrasing, however. So imbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught it; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages. The event is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to ask questions. For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition. Wasn't it true, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the negro from his master, give him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man that owned him? \"Slavery may stay where it is,\" cried the young orator. \"If it is content there, so are we content. What we say is that it shall not go one step farther. No, not one inch into a northern territory.\"  On the next occasion Mr. Brice was one of the orators at a much larger meeting in a garden in South St. Louis. The audience was mostly German. And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr. Brice was able to trace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic wars to its Revolution. Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated to this great and free country. And when in an inspired moment he coupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of the trees above them trembled at their cheers.  And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove with Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena. There was Herr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly; and Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and ponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache that pointed upward. They clattered their steins on the table and sang wonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried off to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with its towers and crooked streets. And when they sang the Trolksmelodie, \"Bemooster Bursche zieh' ich aus,--Ade!\" a big tear rolled down the scar on Richter's cheek.         \"Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm         Ich zieh' nicht mehr in euch herum,         Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,         Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang.\"  As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness of that farewell song. It was Richter who brought the full force of it home to Stephen.  \"Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my friend?\" he asked.  Stephen only nodded. He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even to his mother. And here was the difference between the Saxon and the Anglo-Saxon.  Richter smoked his pipe 'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his face.  \"Tiefel and I were at the University together,\" he said at length. \"He remembers the day I left Jena for good and all. Ah, Stephen, that is the most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland. We dine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy little tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us. We swear for the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for the Fatherland, if God so wills. And then we march at the head of a slow procession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first, then the fox major and the foxes.\"  \"The foxes?\" Stephen interrupted.  \"The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them,\" answered Richter, smiling.  \"And after the foxes,\" said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, \"after the foxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four. It is like a long funeral. And every man is chanting that song. And so we go slowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many a schlager-bout with the aristocrats. And the president of our society makes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all the honors. And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!\" And Herr Tiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.  The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air, shouting:  \"Lebe wohl, Carl! Lebe wohl! Salamander, salamander, salamander! Ein ist ein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei! Lebe wohl!\"  And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they complimented on his speech. And he soon learned to cry Salamander, and to rub his mug on the table, German fashion. He was not long in discovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his companions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South St. Louis. In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom Stephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a United States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in the singing. But presently he carried Richter away with him.  \"What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!\" exclaimed Herr Konig. \"I think he was the best man with the Schlager that Jena ever saw. Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask and fencing hat, all padded. Eh, Rudolph?\"  Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent.  \"I have still a welt that he gave me a month since,\" he said. \"He has left his mark on many an aristocrat.\"  \"And why did you always fight the aristocrats?\" Stephen asked.  They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed.  \"Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend,\" he cried. \"Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor. Because the most of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be by morality and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued. And so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs. We swore to live by the standards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke. We swore to strive for the freedom of Germany with manly courage. And when we were not duelling with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.\"  \"Broadswords?\" exclaimed Stephen, in amazement.  \"Ja wohl,\" answered Korner, puffing heavily. The slit in his nose was plain even in the moonlight. \"To keep our hands in, as you would say. You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager. But we fought that we might not become effete.\"  It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long burning within him.  \"See here, Mr. Korner,\" said he, \"how did Richter come by that scar? He always gets red when I mention it. He will never tell me.\"  \"Ah, I can well believe that,\" answered Korner. \"I will recount that matter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund. He would not forgive me. I was there in Berlin at the time. It was a famous time. Tiefel will bear me out.\"  \"Ja, ja!\" said Tiefel, eagerly.  \"Mr. Brice,\" Herr Korner continued, \"has never heard of the Count von Kalbach. No, of course. We at Jena had, and all Germany. Many of us of the Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager. Von Kalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was worshipped. When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather to look at them. They were like Wodan and Freya. 'Donner'!\" exclaimed Herr Korner, \"there is something in blood, when all is said. He was as straight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a poplar. It is so with the Pomeranians.  \"It was in the year '47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin before his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von Kalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion. He boasted openly that day that none of the despised 'Burschenschaft' dare stand before him. And Carl Richter took up the challenge. Before night all Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena 'Burschenschaft'. To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl likewise feared for him.  \"Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at Jena, since killed in the Breite Strasse. And if you will believe me, my friend. I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak smoking his pipe. The place was filled, the nobles on one side and the Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees. Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon. He would not have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the neck covering --Nothing! So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap, and his apron with the device of the Germanians.  \"There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue. And when it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon all."]]]
