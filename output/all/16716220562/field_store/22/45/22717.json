From the conversation of two Ionian mercenaries behind him he learnt that the family of Amasis had been to the temple to pray for the dying king.  The procession was headed by richly-decorated priests, either wearing long white robes or pantherskins.  They were followed by men holding office at the court, and carrying golden staves, on the ends of which peacocks' feathers and silver lotus-flowers were fastened, and these by Pastophori, carrying on their shoulders a golden cow, the animal sacred to Isis.  When the crowd had bowed down before this sacred symbol, the queen appeared.  She was dressed in priestly robes and wore a costly head-dress with the winged disc and the Uraeus.  In her left hand she held a sacred golden sistrum,  the tones of which were to scare away Typhon, and in her right some lotus-flowers.  The wife, daughter and sister of the high-priest followed her, in similar but less splendid ornaments.  Then came the heir to the throne, in rich robes of state, as priest and prince; and behind him four young priests in white carrying Tachot, (the daughter of Amasis and Ladice and the pretended sister of Nitetis,) in an open litter.  The heat of the day, and the earnestness of her prayers, had given the sick girl a slight color.  Her blue eyes, filled with tears, were fixed on the sistrum which her weak, emaciated hands had hardly strength to hold.  A murmur of compassion ran through the crowd; for they loved their dying king, and manifested openly and gladly the sympathy so usually felt for young lives from whom a brilliant future has been snatched by disease. Such was Amasis' young, fading daughter, who was now being carried past them, and many an eye grew dim as the beautiful invalid came in sight. Tachot seemed to notice this, for she raised her eyes from the sistrum and looked kindly and gratefully at the crowd.  Suddenly the color left her face, she turned deadly pale, and the golden sistrum fell on to the stone pavement with a clang, close to Bartja's feet.  He felt that he had been recognized and for one moment thought of hiding himself in the crowd; but only for one moment--his chivalrous feeling gained the day, he darted forward, picked up the sistrum, and forgetting the danger in which he was placing himself, held it out to the princess.  Tachot looked at him earnestly before taking the golden sistrum from his hands, and then said, in a low voice, which only he could understand: \"Are you Bartja?  Tell me, in your mother's name--are you Bartja?\"  \"Yes, I am,\" was his answer, in a voice as low as her own, \"your friend, Bartja.\"  He could not say more, for the priests pushed him back among the crowd. When he was in his old place, he noticed that Tachot, whose bearers had begun to move on again, was looking round at him.  The color had come back into her cheeks, and her bright eyes were trying to meet his.  He did not avoid them; she threw him a lotus-bud-he stooped to pick it up, and then broke his way through the crowd, for this hasty act had roused their attention.  A quarter of an hour later, he was seated in the boat which was to take him to Sappho and to his wedding.  He was quite at ease now about Zopyrus.  In Bartja's eyes his friend was already as good as saved, and in spite of the dangers which threatened himself, he felt strangely calm and happy, he could hardly say why.  Meanwhile the sick princess had been carried home, had had her oppressive ornaments taken off, and her couch carried on to one of the palace- balconies where she liked best to pass the hot summer days, sheltered by broad-leaved plants, and a kind of awning.  From this veranda, she could look down into the great fore-court of the palace, which was planted with trees.  To-day it was full of priests, courtiers, generals and governors of provinces.  Anxiety and suspense were expressed in every face: Amasis' last hour was drawing very near.  Tachot could not be seen from below; but listening with feverish eagerness, she could hear much that was said.  Now that they had to dread the loss of their king, every one, even the priests, were full of his praises.  The wisdom and circumspection of his plans and modes of government, his unwearied industry, the moderation he had always shown, the keenness of his wit, were, each and all, subjects of admiration. \"How Egypt has prospered under Amasis' government!\" said a Nomarch. \"And what glory he gained for our arms, by the conquest of Cyprus and the war with the Libyans!\"  cried one of the generals.  \"How magnificently he embellished our temples, and what great honors he paid to the goddess of Sais!\"  exclaimed one of the singers of Neith.  \"And then how gracious and condescending he was!\"  murmured a courtier.  \"How cleverly he managed to keep peace with the great powers!\"  said the secretary of state, and the treasurer, wiping away a tear, cried: \"How thoroughly he understood the management of the revenue!  Since the reign of Rameses III. the treasury has not been so well filled as now.\"  \"Psamtik comes into a fine inheritance,\" lisped the courtier, and the soldier exclaimed, \"Yes, but it's to be feared that he'll not spend it in a glorious war; he's too much under the influence of the priests.\"  \"No, you are wrong there,\" answered the temple-singer.  \"For some time past, our lord and master has seemed to disdain the advice of his most faithful servants.\" \"The successor of such a father will find it difficult to secure universal approbation,\" said the Nomarch.  \"It is not every one who has the intellect, the good fortune and the wisdom of Amasis.\"  \"The gods know that!\"  murmured the warrior with a sigh.  Tachot's tears flowed fast.  These words were a confirmation of what they had been trying to hide from her: she was to lose her dear father soon.  After she had made this dreadful certainty clear to her own mind, and discovered that it was in vain to beg her attendants to carry her to her dying father, she left off listening to the courtiers below, and began looking at the sistrum which Bartja himself had put into her hand, and which she had brought on to the balcony with her, as if seeking comfort there.  And she found what she sought; for it seemed to her as if the sound of its sacred rings bore her away into a smiling, sunny landscape.  That faintness which so often comes over people in decline, had seized her and was sweetening her last hours with pleasant dreams.  The female slaves, who stood round to fan away the flies, said afterwards that Tachot had never looked so lovely.  She had lain about an hour in this state, when her breathing became more difficult, a slight cough made her breast heave, and the bright red blood trickled down from her lips on to her white robe.  She awoke, and looked surprised and disappointed on seeing the faces round her.  The sight of her mother, however, who came on to the veranda at that moment, brought a smile to her face, and she said, \"O mother, I have had such a beautiful dream.\"  \"Then our visit to the temple has done my dear child good?\"  asked the queen, trembling at the sight of the blood on the sick girl's lips.  \"Oh, yes, mother, so much! for I saw him again.\"  Ladice's glance at the attendants seemed to ask \"Has your poor mistress lost her senses?\" Tachot understood the look and said, evidently speaking with great difficulty: \"You think I am wandering, mother.  No, indeed, I really saw and spoke to him.  He gave me my sistrum again, and said he was my friend, and then he took my lotus-bud and vanished.  Don't look so distressed and surprised, mother.  What I say is really true; it is no dream.--There, you hear, Tentrut saw him too.  He must have come to Sais for my sake, and so the child-oracle in the temple-court did not deceive me, after all.  And now I don't feel anything more of my illness; I dreamt I was lying in a field of blooming poppies, as red as the blood of the young lambs that are offered in sacrifice; Bartja was sitting by my side, and Nitetis was kneeling close to us and playing wonderful songs on a Nabla  made of ivory.  And there was such a lovely sound in the air that I felt as if Horus, the beautiful god of morning, spring, and the resurrection, was kissing me.  Yes, mother, I tell you he is coming soon, and when I am well, then--then--ah, mother what is this?  .  .  .  I am dying!\"  Ladice knelt down by her child's bed and pressed her lips in burning kisses on the girl's eyes as they grew dim in death.  An hour later she was standing by another bedside--her dying husband's.  Severe suffering had disfigured the king's features, the cold perspiration was standing on his forehead, and his hands grasped the golden lions on the arms of the deep-seated invalid chair in which he was resting, almost convulsively.  When Ladice came in he opened his eyes; they were as keen and intelligent as if he had never lost his sight.  \"Why do not you bring Tachot to me?\"  he asked in a dry voice.  \"She is too ill, and suffers so much, that .  .  .\"  \"She is dead!  Then it is well with her, for death is not punishment; it is the end and aim of life,--the only end that we can attain without effort, but through sufferings!--the gods alone know how great.  Osiris has taken her to himself, for she was innocent.  And Nitetis is dead too. Where is Nebenchari's letter?\"  \"Here is the place: 'She took her own life, and died calling down a heavy curse on thee and thine.  The poor, exiled, scorned and plundered oculist Nebenchari in Babylon sends thee this intelligence to Egypt.  It is as true as his own hatred of thee.'  Listen to these words, Psamtik, and remember how on his dying bed thy father told thee that, for every drachm of pleasure purchased on earth by wrong-doing, the dying bed will be burdened by a talent's weight of remorse.  Fearful misery is coming on Egypt for Nitetis' sake.  Cambyses is preparing to make war on us.  He will sweep down on Egypt like a scorching wind from the desert.

Still I have not lived in vain.  For forty years I have been the careful father and benefactor of a great nation.  Children and children's children will speak of Amasis as a great, wise and humane king; they will read my name on the great works which I have built in Sais and Thebes, and will praise the greatness of my power.  Neither shall I be condemned by Osiris and the forty-two judges of the nether world; the goddess of truth, who holds the balances, will find that my good deeds outweigh my bad.\"--Here the king sighed deeply and remained silent for some time.  Then, looking tenderly at his wife, he said: \"Ladice, thou hast been a faithful, virtuous wife to me. For this I thank thee, and ask thy forgiveness for much.  We have often misunderstood one another.  Indeed it was easier for me to accustom myself to the Greek modes of thought, than for a Greek to understand our Egyptian ideas.  Thou know'st my love of Greek art,--thou know'st how I enjoyed the society of thy friend Pythagoras, who was thoroughly initiated in all that we believe and know, and adopted much from us.  He comprehended the deep wisdom which lies in the doctrines that I reverence most, and he took care not to speak lightly of truths which our priests are perhaps too careful to hide from the people; for though the many bow down before that which they cannot understand, they would be raised and upheld by those very truths, if explained to them.  To a Greek mind our worship of animals presents the greatest difficulty, but to my own the worship of the Creator in his creatures seems more just and more worthy of a human being, than the worship of his likeness in stone.  The Greek deities are moreover subject to every human infirmity; indeed I should have made my queen very unhappy by living in the same manner as her great god Zeus.\"  At these words the king smiled, and then went on: \"And what has given rise to this?  The Hellenic love of beauty in form, which, in the eye of a Greek, is superior to every thing else.  He cannot separate the body from the soul, because he holds it to be the most glorious of formed things, and indeed, believes that a beautiful spirit must necessarily inhabit a beautiful body.  Their gods, therefore, are only elevated human beings, but we adore an unseen power working in nature and in ourselves. The animal takes its place between ourselves and nature; its actions are guided, not, like our own, by the letter, but by the eternal laws of nature,  which owe their origin to the Deity, while the letter is a device of man's own mind.  And then, too, where amongst ourselves do we find so earnest a longing and endeavor to gain freedom, the highest good, as among the animals?  Where such a regular and well-balanced life from generation to generation, without instruction or precept?\"  Here the king's voice failed.  He was obliged to pause for a few moments, and then continued: \"I know that my end is near; therefore enough of these matters.  My son and successor, hear my last wishes and act upon them; they are the result of experience.  But alas! how often have I seen, that rules of life given by one man to another are useless.  Every man must earn his own experience.  His own losses make him prudent, his own learning wise.  Thou, my son, art coming to the throne at a mature age; thou hast had time and opportunity to judge between right and wrong, to note what is beneficial and what hurtful, to see and compare many things.  I give thee, therefore, only a few wholesome counsels, and only fear that though I offer them with my right hand, thou wilt accept them with the left.  \"First, however, I must say that, notwithstanding my blindness, my indifference to what has been going on during the past months has been only apparent.  I left you to your own devices with a good intention. Rhodopis told me once one of her teacher AEsop's fables: 'A traveller, meeting a man on his road, asked him how long it would be before he reached the nearest town.'  'Go on, go on,' cried the other.  'But I want to know first when I shall get to the town.'  'Go on, only go on,' was the answer.  The traveller left him with angry words and abuse; but he had not gone many steps when the man called after him: 'You will be there in an hour.  I could not answer your question until I had seen your pace.'  \"I bore this fable in my mind for my son's sake, and watched in silence at what pace he was ruling his people.  Now I have discovered what I wish to know, and this is my advice: Examine into everything your self.  It is the duty of every man, but especially of a king, to acquaint himself intimately with all that concerns the weal or woe of his people.  You, my son, are in the habit of using the eyes and ears of other men instead of going to the fountain-head yourself.  I am sure that your advisers, the priests, only desire what is good; but .  .  .  Neithotep, I must beg you to leave us alone for a few moments.\"  When the priest was gone the king exclaimed \"They wish for what is good, but good only for themselves.  But we are not kings of priests and aristocrats only, we are kings of a nation!  Do not listen to the advice of this proud caste alone, but read every petition yourself, and, by appointing Nomarchs devoted to the king and beloved by the people, make yourself acquainted with the needs and wishes of the Egyptian nation.  It is not difficult to govern well, if you are aware of the state of feeling in your land.  Choose fit men to fill the offices of state.  I have taken care that the kingdom shall be properly divided.  The laws are good, and have proved themselves so; hold fast by these laws, and trust no one who sets himself above them; for law is invariably wiser than the individual man, and its transgressor deserves his punishment.  The people understand this well, and are ready to sacrifice themselves for us, when they see that we are ready to give up our own will to the law.  You do not care for the people.  I know their voice is often rude and rough, but it utters wholesome truths, and no one needs to hear truth more than a king. The Pharaoh who chooses priests and courtiers for his advisers, will hear plenty of flattering words, while he who tries to fulfil the wishes of the nation will have much to suffer from those around him; but the latter will feel peace in his own heart, and be praised in the ages to come.  I have often erred, yet the Egyptians will weep for me, as one who knew their needs and considered their welfare like a father.  A king who really knows his duties, finds it an easy and beautiful task to win the love of the people--an unthankful one to gain the applause of the great-- almost an impossibility to content both.  \"Do not forget,--I say it again,--that kings and priests exist for the people, and not the people for their kings and priests.  Honor religion for its own sake and as the most important means of securing the obedience of the governed to their governors; but at the same time show its promulgators that you look on them, not as receptacles, but as servants, of the Deity.  Hold fast, as the law commands, by what is old; but never shut the gates of your kingdom against what is new, if better. Bad men break at once with the old traditions; fools only care for what is new and fresh; the narrowminded and the selfish privileged class cling indiscriminately to all that is old, and pronounce progress to be a sin; but the wise endeavor to retain all that has approved itself in the past, to remove all that has become defective, and to adopt whatever is good, from whatever source it may have sprung.  Act thus, my son.  The priests will try to keep you back--the Greeks to urge you forward.  Choose one party or the other, but beware of indecision--of yielding to the one to-day, to the other to-morrow.  Between two stools a man falls to the ground.  Let the one party be your friends, the other your enemies; by trying to please both, you will have both opposed to you.  Human beings hate the man who shows kindness to their enemies.  In the last few months, during which you have ruled independently, both parties have been offended by your miserable indecision.  The man who runs backwards and forwards like a child, makes no progress, and is soon weary.  I have till now--till I felt that death was near--always encouraged the Greeks and opposed the priests.  In the active business of life, the clever, brave Greeks seemed to me especially serviceable; at death, I want men who can make me out a pass into the nether regions.  The gods forgive me for not being able to resist words that sound so like a joke, even in my last hour!  They created me and must take me as I am.  I rubbed my hands for joy when I became king; with thee, my son, coming to the throne is a graver matter.--Now call Neithotep back; I have still something to say to you both.\"  The king gave his hand to the high-priest as he entered, saving: \"I leave you, Neithotep, without ill-will, though my opinion that you have been a better priest than a servant to your king, remains unaltered.  Psamtik will probably prove a more obedient follower than I have been, but one thing I wish to impress earnestly on you both: Do not dismiss the Greek mercenaries until the war with the Persians is over, and has ended we will hope--in victory for Egypt.  My former predictions are not worth anything now; when death draws near, we get depressed, and things begin to look a little black.  Without the auxiliary troops we shall be hopelessly lost, but with them victory is not impossible.  Be clever; show the Ionians that they are fighting on the Nile for the freedom of their own country--that Cambyses, if victorious, will not be contented with Egypt alone, while his defeat may bring freedom to their own enslaved countrymen in Ionia.  I know you agree with me, Neithotep, for in your heart you "]]]
