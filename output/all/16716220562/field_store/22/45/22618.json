When the Mohar had given the reins into the hand of a servant, he sprang from his chariot, and after the usual form of obeisance said to the princess:  \"In this valley lies the loathsome den of the people, to whom thou, O princess, dost deign to do such high honor.  Permit me to go forward as guide to thy party.\"  \"We will go on foot,\" said the princess, \"and leave our followers behind here,\"  Paaker bowed, Bent-Anat threw the reins to her charioteer and sprang to the ground, the wife of Mena and the courtiers left their litters, and the fan-bearers and chamberlains were about to accompany their mistress on foot into the little valley, when she turned round and ordered, \"Remain behind, all of you.  Only Paaker and Nefert need go with me.\"  The princess hastened forward into the gorge, which was oppressive with the noon-tide heat; but she moderated her steps as soon as she observed that the frailer Nefert found it difficult to follow her.  At a bend in the road Paaker stood still, and with him Bent-Anat and Nefert.  Neither of them had spoken a word during their walk.  The valley was perfectly still and deserted; on the highest pinnacles of the cliff, which rose perpendicularly to the right, sat a long row of vultures, as motionless as if the mid-day heat had taken all strength out of their wings.  Paaker bowed before them as being the sacred animals of the Great Goddess of Thebes,       [She formed a triad with Anion and Chunsu under the name of Muth.      The great \"Sanctuary of the kingdom\"--the temple of Karnak--was      dedicated to them.]  and the two women silently followed his example.  \"There,\" said the Mohar, pointing to two huts close to the left cliff of the valley, built of bricks made of dried Nile-mud, \"there, the neatest, next the cave in the rock.\"  Bent-Anat went towards the solitary hovel with a beating heart; Paaker let the ladies go first.  A few steps brought them to an ill-constructed fence of canestalks, palm-branches, briars and straw, roughly thrown together.  A heart-rending cry of pain from within the hut trembled in the air and arrested the steps of the two women.  Nefert staggered and clung to her stronger companion, whose beating heart she seemed to hear. Both stood a few minutes as if spellbound, then the princess called Paaker, and said:  \"You go first into the house.\"  Paaker bowed to the ground.  \"I will call the man out,\" he said, \"but how dare we step over his threshold.  Thou knowest such a proceeding will defile us.\"  Nefert looked pleadingly at Bent-Anat, but the princess repeated her command.  \"Go before me; I have no fear of defilement.\"  The Mohar still hesitated.  \"Wilt thou provoke the Gods?--and defile thyself?\"  But the princess let him say no more; she signed to Nefert, who raised her hands in horror and aversion; so, with a shrug of her shoulders, she left her companion behind with the Mohar, and stepped through an opening in the hedge into a little court, where lay two brown goats; a donkey with his forelegs tied together stood by, and a few hens were scattering the dust about in a vain search for food.  Soon she stood, alone, before the door of the paraschites' hovel.  No one perceived her, but she could not take her eyes-accustomed only to scenes of order and splendor--from the gloomy but wonderfully strange picture, which riveted her attention and her sympathy.  At last she went up to the doorway, which was too low for her tall figure.  Her heart shrunk painfully within her, and she would have wished to grow smaller, and, instead of shining in splendor, to have found herself wrapped in a beggar's robe.  Could she step into this hovel decked with gold and jewels as if in mockery?--like a tyrant who should feast at a groaning table and compel the starving to look on at the banquet.  Her delicate perception made her feel what trenchant discord her appearance offered to all that surrounded her, and the discord pained her; for she could not conceal from herself that misery and external meanness were here entitled to give the key-note and that her magnificence derived no especial grandeur from contrast with all these modest accessories, amid dust, gloom, and suffering, but rather became disproportionate and hideous, like a giant among pigmies.  She had already gone too far to turn back, or she would willingly have done so.  The longer she gazed into the but, the more deeply she felt the impotence of her princely power, the nothingness of the splendid gifts with which she approached it, and that she might not tread the dusty floor of this wretched hovel but in all humility, and to crave a pardon.  The room into which she looked was low but not very small, and obtained from two cross lights a strange and unequal illumination; on one side the light came through the door, and on the other through an opening in the time-worn ceiling of the room, which had never before harbored so many and such different guests.  All attention was concentrated on a group, which was clearly lighted up from the doorway.  On the dusty floor of the room cowered an old woman, with dark weather- beaten features and tangled hair that had long been grey.  Her black-blue cotton shirt was open over her withered bosom, and showed a blue star tattooed upon it.  In her lap she supported with her hands the head of a girl, whose slender body lay motionless on a narrow, ragged mat.  The little white feet of the sick girl almost touched the threshold.  Near to them squatted a benevolent-looking old man, who wore only a coarse apron, and sitting all in a heap, bent forward now and then, rubbing the child's feet with his lean hands and muttering a few words to himself.  The sufferer wore nothing but a short petticoat of coarse light-blue stuff.  Her face, half resting on the lap of the old woman, was graceful and regular in form, her eyes were half shut-like those of a child, whose soul is wrapped in some sweet dream-but from her finely chiselled lips there escaped from time to time a painful, almost convulsive sob.  An abundance of soft, but disordered reddish fair hair, in which clung a few withered flowers, fell over the lap of the old woman and on to the mat where she lay.  Her cheeks were white and rosy-red, and when the young surgeon Nebsecht--who sat by her side, near his blind, stupid companion, the litany-singer--lifted the ragged cloth that had been thrown over her bosom, which had been crushed by the chariot wheel, or when she lifted her slender arm, it was seen that she had the shining fairness of those daughters of the north who not unfrequently came to Thebes among the king's prisoners of war.  The two physicians sent hither from the House of Seti sat on the left side of the maiden on a little carpet.  From time to time one or the other laid his hand over the heart of the sufferer, or listened to her breathing, or opened his case of medicaments, and moistened the compress on her wounded breast with a white ointment.  In a wide circle close to the wall of the room crouched several women, young and old, friends of the paraschites, who from time to time gave expression to their deep sympathy by a piercing cry of lamentation.  One of them rose at regular intervals to fill the earthen bowl by the side of the physician with fresh water.  As often as the sudden coolness of a fresh compress on her hot bosom startled the sick girl, she opened her eyes, but always soon to close them again for longer interval, and turned them at first in surprise, and then with gentle reverence, towards a particular spot.  These glances had hitherto been unobserved by him to whom they were directed.  Leaning against the wall on the right hand side of the room, dressed in his long, snow-white priest's robe, Pentaur stood awaiting the princess. His head-dress touched the ceiling, and the narrow streak of light, which fell through the opening in the roof, streamed on his handsome head and his breast, while all around him was veiled in twilight gloom.  Once more the suffering girl looked up, and her glance this time met the eye of the young priest, who immediately raised his hand, and half- mechanically, in a low voice, uttered the words of blessing; and then once more fixed his gaze on the dingy floor, and pursued his own reflections.  Some hours since he had come hither, obedient to the orders of Ameni, to impress on the princess that she had defiled herself by touching a paraschites, and could only be cleansed again by the hand of the priests.  He had crossed the threshold of the paraschites most reluctantly, and the thought that he, of all men, had been selected to censure a deed of the noblest humanity, and to bring her who had done it to judgment, weighed upon him as a calamity.  In his intercourse with his friend Nebsecht, Pentaur had thrown off many fetters, and given place to many thoughts that his master would have held sinful and presumptuous; but at the same time he acknowledged the sanctity of the old institutions, which were upheld by those whom lie had learned to regard as the divinely-appointed guardians of the spiritual possessions of God's people; nor was he wholly free from the pride of caste and the haughtiness which, with prudent intent, were inculcated in the priests.  He held the common man, who put forth his strength to win a maintenance for his belongings by honest bodily labor--the merchant--the artizan--the peasant, nay even the warrior, as far beneath the godly brotherhood who strove for only spiritual ends; and most of all he scorned the idler, given up to sensual enjoyments.  He held him unclean who had been branded by the law; and how should it have been otherwise?  These people, who at the embalming of the dead opened the body of the deceased, had become despised for their office of mutilating the sacred temple of the soul; but no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","chose his calling of his own free will.--[Diodorus I, 91]--It was handed down from father to son, and he who was born a paraschites--so he was taught--had to expiate an old guilt with which his soul had long ago burdened itself in a former existence, within another body, and which had deprived it of absolution in the nether world.  It had passed through various animal forms, and now began a new human course in the body of a paraschites, once more to stand after death in the presence of the judges of the under-world.  Pentaur had crossed the threshold of the man he despised with aversion; the man himself, sitting at the feet of the suffering girl, had exclaimed as he saw the priest approaching the hovel:  \"Yet another white robe!  Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\"  Pentaur had not answered the old man, who on his part took no further notice of him, while he rubbed the girl's feet by order of the leech; and his hands impelled by tender anxiety untiringly continued the same movement, as the water-wheel in the Nile keeps up without intermission its steady motion in the stream.  \"Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\"  Pentaur asked himself.  \"Does it indeed possess a purifying efficacy, and is it possible that the Gods, who gave to fire the power of refining metals and to the winds power to sweep the clouds from the sky, should desire that a man--made in their own image--that a man should be tainted from his birth to his death with an indelible stain?\"  He looked at the face of the paraschites, and it seemed to him to resemble that of his father.  This startled him!  And when he noticed how the woman, in whose lap the girl's head was resting, bent over the injured bosom of the child to catch her breathing, which she feared had come to a stand-still--with the anguish of a dove that is struck down by a hawk--he remembered a moment in his own childhood, when he had lain trembling with fever on his little bed. What then had happened to him, or had gone on around him, he had long forgotten, but one image was deeply imprinted on his soul, that of the face of his mother bending over him in deadly anguish, but who had gazed on her sick boy not more tenderly, or more anxiously, than this despised woman on her suffering child.  \"There is only one utterly unselfish, utterly pure and utterly divine love,\" said he to himself, \"and that is the love of Isis for Horus--the love of a mother for her child.  If these people were indeed so foul as to defile every thing they touch, how would this pure, this tender, holy impulse show itself even in them in all its beauty and perfection?\"  \"Still,\" he continued, \"the Celestials  have implanted maternal love in the breast of the lioness, of the typhonic river-horse of the Nile.\"  He looked compassionately at the wife of the paraschites.  He saw her dark face as she turned it away from the sick girl.  She had felt her breathe, and a smile of happiness lighted up her old features; she nodded first to the surgeon, and then with a deep sigh of relief to her husband, who, while he did not cease the movement of his left hand, held up his right hand in prayer to heaven, and his wife did the same.  It seemed to Pentaur that he could see the souls of these two, floating above the youthful creature in holy union as they joined their hands; and again he thought of his parents' house, of the hour when his sweet, only sister died.  His mother had thrown herself weeping on the pale form, but his father had stamped his foot and had thrown back his head, sobbing and striking his forehead with his fist.  \"How piously submissive and thankful are these unclean ones!\"  thought Pentaur; and repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart. \"Maternal love may exist in the hyaena, but to seek and find God pertains only to man, who has a noble aim.  Up to the limits of eternity--and God is eternal!--thought is denied to animals; they cannot even smile.  Even men cannot smile at first, for only physical life--an animal soul--dwells in them; but soon a share of the world's soul--beaming intelligence-- works within them, and first shows itself in the smile of a child, which is as pure as the light and the truth from which it comes.  The child of the paraschites smiles like any other creature born of woman, but how few aged men there are, even among the initiated, who can smile as innocently and brightly as this woman who has grown grey under open ill-treatment.\"  Deep sympathy began to fill his heart, and he knelt down by the side of the poor child, raised her arm, and prayed fervently to that One who had created the heavens and who rules the world--to that One, whom the mysteries of faith forbade him to name; and not to the innumerable gods, whom the people worshipped, and who to him were nothing but incarnations of the attributes of the One and only God of the initiated--of whom he was one--who was thus brought down to the comprehension of the laity.  He raised his soul to God in passionate emotion; but he prayed, not for the child before him and for her recovery, but rather for the whole despised race, and for its release from the old ban, for the enlightenment of his own soul, imprisoned in doubts, and for strength to fulfil his hard task with discretion.  The gaze of the sufferer followed him as he took up his former position.  The prayer had refreshed his soul and restored him to cheerfulness of spirit.  He began to reflect what conduct he must observe towards the princess.  He had not met Bent-Anat for the first time yesterday; on the contrary, he had frequently seen her in holiday processions, and at the high festivals in the Necropolis, and like all his young companions had admired her proud beauty--admired it as the distant light of the stars, or the evening-glow on the horizon.  Now he must approach this lady with words of reproof.  He pictured to himself the moment when he must advance to meet her, and could not help thinking of his little tutor Chufu, above whom he towered by two heads while he was still a boy, and who used to call up his admonitions to him from below.  It was true, he himself was tall and slim, but he felt as if to-day he were to play the part towards Bent-Anat of the much-laughed-at little tutor.  His sense of the comic was touched, and asserted itself at this serious moment, and with such melancholy surroundings.  Life is rich in contrasts, and a susceptible and highly-strung human soul would break down like a bridge under the measured tread of soldiers, if it were allowed to let the burden of the heaviest thoughts and strongest feelings work upon it in undisturbed monotony; but just as in music every key-note has its harmonies, so when we cause one chord of our heart to vibrate for long, all sorts of strange notes respond and clang, often those which we least expect.  Pentaur's glance flew round the one low, over-filled room of the paraschites' hut, and like a lightning flash the thought, \"How will the princess and her train find room here?\"  flew through his mind.  His fancy was lively, and vividly brought before him how the daughter of the Pharaoh with a crown on her proud head would bustle into the silent chamber, how the chattering courtiers would follow her, and how the women by the walls, the physicians by the side of the sick girl, the sleek white cat from the chest where she sat, would rise and throng round her. There must be frightful confusion.  Then he imagined how the smart lords and ladies would keep themselves far from the unclean, hold their slender hands over their mouths and noses, and suggest to the old folks how they ought to behave to the princess who condescended to bless them with her presence.  The old woman must lay down the head that rested in her bosom, the paraschites must drop the feet he so anxiously rubbed, on the floor, to rise and kiss the dust before Bent-Anat.  Whereupon--the \"mind's eye\" of the young priest seemed to see it all--the courtiers fled before him, pushing each other, and all crowded together into a corner, and at last the princess threw a few silver or gold rings into the laps of the father and mother, and perhaps to the girl too, and he seemed to hear the courtiers all cry out: \"Hail to the gracious daughter of the Sun!\"--to hear the joyful exclamations of the crowd of women--to see the gorgeous apparition leave the hut of the despised people, and then to see, instead of the lovely sick child who still breathed audibly, a silent corpse on the crumpled mat, and in the place of the two tender nurses at her head and feet, two heart-broken, loud-lamenting wretches.  Pentaur's hot spirit was full of wrath.  As soon as the noisy cortege appeared actually in sight he would place himself in the doorway, forbid the princess to enter, and receive her with strong words.  She could hardly come hither out of human kindness.  \"She wants variety,\" said he to himself, \"something new at Court; for there is little going on there now the king tarries with the troops in a distant country; it tickles the vanity of the great to find themselves once in a while in contact with the small, and it is well to have your goodness of heart spoken of by the people.  If a little misfortune opportunely happens, it is not worth the trouble to inquire whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief to such wretched people.\"  He ground his teeth angrily, and thought no more of the defilement which might threaten Bent-Anat from the paraschites, but exclusively, on the contrary, of the impending desecration by the princess of the holy feelings astir in this silent room.  Excited as he was to fanaticism, his condemning lips could not fail to find vigorous and impressive words.  He stood drawn to his full height and drawing his breath deeply, like a spirit of light who holds his weapon raised to annihilate a demon of darkness, and he looked out into the valley to perceive from afar the cry of the runners and the rattle of the wheels of"]]]
