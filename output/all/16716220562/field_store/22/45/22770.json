Yonder portrait shows the perfect flower, but the bud possessed, if possible, even more exquisite charm.  How clear and earnest was the gaze of her bright eyes!  When she was gay they could shine like stars, and then her little red mouth had an indescribably mischievous expression, and in each cheek came one of the tiny dimples which still delight every one.  Her nose was more delicate than it is now, and the slight curve which appears in the portrait, and which is far too prominent in the coins, was not visible.  Her hair did not grow dark until later in life. My sister Charmian had no greater pleasure than to arrange its wavy abundance.  It was like silk, she often said, and she was right.  I know this, for when at the festival of Isis, Cleopatra, holding the sistrum, followed the image of the goddess, she was obliged to wear it unconfined. On her return home she often shook her head merrily, and her hair fell about her like a cataract, veiling her face and figure.  Then, as now, she was not above middle height, but her form possessed the most exquisite symmetry, only it was still more delicate and pliant.  \"She had understood how to win all hearts.  Yet, though she seemed to esteem our father higher, trust me more fully, look up to Anubis with greater reverence, and prefer to argue with the keen-witted Timagenes, she still appeared to hold all who surrounded her in equal favour, while Arsinoe left me in the lurch if Straton were present, and whenever the handsome Melnodor, one of my father's pupils, came to us, she fairly devoured him with her glowing eyes.  \"As soon as it was rumoured that the Romans were bringing the King back, Queen Berenike came to us to take the young girls to the city.  When Cleopatra entreated her to leave her in our parents' care and not interrupt her studies, a scornful smile flitted over Berenike's face, and turning to her husband Archelaus, she said scornfully, 'I think books will prove to be the smallest danger.'  \"Pothinus, the guardian of the two princesses' brothers, had formerly permitted them at times to visit their sisters.  Now they were no longer allowed to leave Lochias, but neither Cleopatra nor Arsinoe made many inquiries about them.  The little boys always retreated from their caresses, and the Egyptian locks on their temples, which marked the age of childhood, and the Egyptian garments which Pothinus made them wear, lent them an unfamiliar aspect.  \"When it was reported that the Romans were advancing from Gaza, both girls were overpowered by passionate excitement.  Arsinoe's glittered in every glance; Cleopatra understood how to conceal hers, but her colour often varied, and her face, which was not pink and white like her sister's, but--how shall I express it?\"  \"I know what you mean,\" Barine interrupted.  \"When I saw her, nothing seemed to me more charming than that pallid hue through which the crimson of her cheeks shines like the flame through yonder alabaster lamp, the tint of the peach through the down.  I have seen it often in convalescents.  Aphrodite breathes this hue on the faces and figures of her favourites only, as the god of time imparts the green tinge to the bronze.  Nothing is more beautiful than when such women blush.\"  \"Your sight is keen,\" replied Archibius, smiling.  \"It seemed indeed as if not Eos, but her faint reflection in the western horizon, was tinting the sky, when joy or shame sent the colour to her cheeks, But when wrath took possession of her--and ere the King's return this often happened-- she could look as if she were lifeless, like a marble statue, with lips as colourless as those of a corpse.  \"My father said that the blood of Physkon and other degenerate ancestors, who had not learned to control their passions, was asserting itself in her also.  But I must continue my story, or the messenger will interrupt me too soon.  \"Gabinius was bringing back the King.  But from the time of his approach with the Roman army and the auxiliary troops of the Ethnarch of Judea, nothing more was learned of him or of Antipater, who commanded the forces of Hyrkanus; every one talked constantly of the Roman general Antony.  He had led the troops successfully through the deserts between Syria and the Egyptian Delta without losing a single man on the dangerous road by the Sirbonian Sea and Barathra, where many an army had met destruction.  Not to Antipater, but to him, had the Jewish garrison of Pelusium surrendered their city without striking a blow.  He had conquered in two battles; and the second, where, as you know, Berenike's husband fell after a brave resistance, had decided the destiny of the country.  \"From the time his name was first mentioned, neither of the girls could hear enough about him.  It was said that he was the most aristocratic of aristocratic Romans, the most reckless of the daring, the wildest of the riotous, and the handsomest of the handsome.  \"The waiting-maid from Mantua, with whom Cleopatra practised speaking the Roman language, had often seen him, and had heard of him still more frequently--for his mode of life was the theme of gossip among all classes of Roman men and women.  His house was said to have descended in a direct line from Hercules, and his figure and magnificent black beard recalled his ancestor.  You know him, and know that the things reported of him are those which a young girl cannot hear with indifference, and at that time he was nearly five lustra younger than he is to-day.  \"How eagerly Arsinoe listened when his name was uttered!  How Cleopatra flushed and paled when Timagenes condemned him as an unprincipled libertine!  True, Antony was opening her father's path to his home.  \"The flute-player had not forgotten his daughters.  He had remained aloof from the battle, but as soon as the victory was decided, he pressed on into the city.  \"The road led past our garden.  \"The King had barely time to send a runner to his daughters, fifteen minutes before his arrival, to say that he desired to greet them.  They were hurriedly attired in festal garments, and both presented an appearance that might well gladden a father's heart.  \"Cleopatra was not yet as tall as Arsinoe, but, though only fourteen, she looked like a full-grown maiden, while her sister's face and figure showed that in years she was still a child.  But she was no longer one in heart.  Bouquets for the returning sovereign had been arranged as well as haste permitted.  Each one of the girls held one in her hand when the train approached.  \"My parents accompanied them to the garden gate.  I could see what was passing, but could hear distinctly only the voices of the men.  \"The King alighted from the travelling chariot, which was drawn by eight white Median steeds.  The chamberlain who attended him was obliged to support him.  His face, reddened by his potations, fairly beamed as he greeted his daughters.  His joyful surprise at the sight of both, but especially of Cleopatra, was evident.  True, he kissed and embraced Arsinoe, but after that he had eyes and ears solely for Cleopatra.  \"Yet his younger daughter was very beautiful.  Away from her sister, she would have commanded the utmost admiration; but Cleopatra was like the sun, beside which every other heavenly body pales.  Yet, no; she should not be compared to the sun.  It was part of the fascination she exerted that every one felt compelled to gaze at her, to discover the source of the charm which emanated from her whole person.  \"Antony, too, was enthralled by the spell as soon as he heard the first words from her lips.  He had dashed up to the King's chariot, and seeing the two daughters by their father's side, he greeted them with a hasty salute.  When, in reply to the question whether he might hope for her gratitude for bringing her father back to her so quickly, she said that as a daughter she sincerely rejoiced, but as an Egyptian the task would be harder, he gazed more keenly at her.  \"I did not know her answer until later; but ere the last sound of her voice had died away, I saw the Roman spring from his charger and fling the bridle to Ammonius--the chamberlain who had assisted the King from the chariot--as if he were his groom.  The woman-hunter had met with rare game in his pursuit of the fairest, and while he continued his conversation with Cleopatra her father sometimes joined in, and his deep laughter was often heard.  \"No one would have recognized the earnest disciple of Epicurus.  We had often heard apt replies and original thoughts from Cleopatra's lips, but she had rarely answered Timagenes's jests with another.  Now she found-- one could see it by watching the speakers--a witty answer to many of Antony's remarks.  It seemed as if, for the first time, she had met some one for whom she deemed it worth while to bring into the field every gift of her deep and quick intelligence.  Yet she did not lose for a moment her womanly dignity; her eyes did not sparkle one whit more brightly than during an animated conversation with me or our father.  \"It was very different with Arsinoe.  When Antony flung himself from his horse, she had moved nearer to her sister, but, as the Roman continued to overlook her, her face crimsoned, she bit her scarlet lips.  Her whole attitude betrayed the agitation that mastered her, and I, who knew her, saw by the expression of her eyes and her quivering nostrils that she was on the point of bursting into tears.  Though Cleopatra stood so much nearer to my heart, I felt sorry for her, and longed to touch the arm of the haughty Roman, who indeed looked like the god of war, and whisper to him to take some little notice of the poor child, who was also a daughter of the King.  \"But a still harder blow was destined to fall upon Arsinoe; for when the King, who had been holding both bouquets, warned Antony that it was time to depart,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5474"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 02 (#7)"],["body","took one, and I heard him say in his deep, loud tones, 'Whoever calls such flowers his daughters does not need so many others.' Then he gave Cleopatra the blossoms and, laying his hand upon his heart, expressed the hope of seeing her in Alexandria, and swung himself upon the charger which the chamberlain, pale with fury, was still holding by the bridle.  \"The flute-player was delighted with his oldest daughter, and told my father he would have the young princess conveyed to the city on the day after the morrow.  The next day he had things to do of which he desired her to have no knowledge.  Our father, in token of his gratitude, should retain for himself and his heirs the summer palace and the garden.  He would see that the change of owner was entered in the land register. This was really done that very day.  It was, indeed, his first act save one--the execution of his daughter Berenike.  \"This ruler, who would have seemed to any one who beheld his meeting with his children a warm-hearted man and a tender father, at that time would have put half Alexandria to the sword, had not Antony interposed.  He forbade the bloodshed, and honoured Berenike's dead husband by a stately funeral.  \"As the steed bore him away, he turned back towards Cleopatra; he could not have saluted Arsinoe, for she had rushed into the garden, and her swollen face betrayed that she had shed burning tears.  \"From that hour she bitterly hated Cleopatra.  \"On the day appointed, the King brought the princesses to the city with regal splendour.  The Alexandrians joyously greeted the royal sisters, as, seated on a golden throne, over which waved ostrich-feathers, they were borne in state down the Street of the King, surrounded by dignitaries, army commanders, the body-guard, and the senate of the city. Cleopatra received the adulation of the populace with gracious majesty, as if she were already Queen.  Whoever had seen her as, with floods of tears, she bade us all farewell, assuring us of her gratitude and faithful remembrance, the sisterly affection she showed me--I had just been elected commander of the Ephebi--\"  Here Archibius was interrupted by a slave, who announced the arrival of the messenger, and, rising hurriedly, he went to Leonax's workshop, to which the man had been conducted, that he might speak to him alone.
