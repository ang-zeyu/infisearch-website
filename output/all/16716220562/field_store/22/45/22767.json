D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.    CHAPTER IV.  The house facing the garden of the Paneum, where Barine lived, was the property of her mother, who had inherited it from her parents.  The artist Leonax, the young beauty's father, son of the old philosopher Didymus, had died long before.  After Barine's unhappy marriage with Philostratus was dissolved, she had returned to her mother, who managed the affairs of the household.  She too, belonged to a family of scholars and had a brother who had won high repute as a philosopher, and had directed the studies of the young Octavianus.  This had occurred long before the commencement of the hostility which separated the heirs of Caesar and Mark Antony.  But even after the latter had deserted Octavia, the sister of Octavianus, to return to Cleopatra, the object of his love, and there was an open breach between the two rivals for the sovereignty of the world, Antony had been friendly to Arius and borne him no grudge for his close relations to his rival.  The generous Roman had even given his enemy's former tutor a fine house, to show him that he was glad to have him in Alexandria and near his person.  The widow Berenike, Barine's mother, was warmly attached to her only brother, who often joined her daughter's guests.  She was a quiet, modest woman whose happiest days had been passed in superintending the education of her children, Barine, the fiery Hippias, and the quiet Helena, who for several years had lived with her grandparents and, with faithful devotion, assumed the duty of caring for them.  She had been more easily guided than the two older children; for the boy's aspiring spirit had often drawn him beyond his mother's control, and the beautiful, vivacious girl had early possessed charms so unusual that she could not remain unnoticed.  Hippias had studied oratory, first in Alexandria and later in Athens and Rhodes.  Three years before, his uncle Arius had sent him with excellent letters of introduction to Rome to become acquainted with the life of the capital and try whether, in spite of his origin, his brilliant gifts of eloquence would forward his fortunes there.  Two miserable years with an infamous, unloved husband had changed the wild spirits of Barine's childhood into the sunny cheerfulness now one of her special charms.  Her mother was conscious of having desired only her best good in uniting the girl of sixteen to Philostratus, whom the grandfather Didymus then considered a very promising young man, and whose advancement, in addition to his own talents, his brother Alexas, Antony's favourite, promised to aid.  She had believed that this step would afford the gay, beautiful girl the best protection from the perils of the corrupt capital; but the worthless husband had caused both mother and daughter much care and sorrow, while his brother Alexas, who constantly pursued his young sister-in-law with insulting attentions, was the source of almost equal trouble.  Berenike often gazed in silent astonishment at the child, who, spite of such sore grief and humiliation, had preserved the innocent light-heartedness which made her seem as if life had offered her only thornless roses.  Her father, Leonax, had been one of the most distinguished artists of the day, and Barine had inherited from him the elastic artist temperament which speedily rebounds from the heaviest pressure.  To him also she owed the rare gift of song, which had been carefully cultivated and had already secured her the first position in the woman's chorus at the festival of the great goddesses of the city.  Every one was full of her praises, and after she had sung the Yalemos in the palace over the waxen image of the favourite of the gods, slain by the boar, her name was eagerly applauded.  To have heard her was esteemed a privilege, for she sang only in her own house or at religious ceremonials \"for the honour of the gods.\"  The Queen, too, had heard her, and, after the Adonis festival, her uncle Arius had presented her to Antony, who expressed his admiration with all the fervour of his frank nature, and afterwards came to her house a second time, accompanied by his son Antyllus.  Doubtless he would have called on her frequently and tested upon her heart his peculiar power over women, had he not been compelled to leave the city on the day after his last visit.  Berenike had reproved her brother for bringing the Queen's lover to Barine, for her anxiety was increased by the repeated visits of Antony's son, and still more aroused by that of Caesarion, who was presented by Antyllus.  These youths were not numbered among the guests whose presence she welcomed and whose conversation afforded her pleasure.  It was flattering that they should honour her simple home by their visits, but she knew that Caesarion came without his tutor's knowledge, and perceived, by the expression of his eyes, what drew him to her daughter.  Besides, Berenike, in rearing the two children, who had been the source of so much anxiety had lost the joyous confidence which had characterized her own youth.  Whenever life presented any new phase, she saw the dark side first.  If a burning candle stood before her, the shadow of the candlestick caught her eye before the light.  Her whole mental existence became a chain of fears, but the kind-hearted woman loved her children too tenderly to permit them to see it.  Only it was a relief to her heart when some of her evil forebodings were realized, to say that she had foreseen it all.  No trace of this was legible in her face, a countenance still pretty and pleasing in its unruffled placidity.  She talked very little, but what she did say was sensible, and proved how attentively she understood how to listen.  So she was welcome among Barine's guests.  Even the most distinguished received something from her, because he felt that the quiet woman understood him.  Before Barine had returned that evening, something had occurred which made her mother doubly regret the accident to her brother Arius the day before.  On his way home from his sister's he had been run over by a chariot darting recklessly along the Street of the King, and was carried, severely injured, to his home, where he now lay helpless and fevered. Nor did it lessen his sufferings to hear his two sons threaten to take vengeance on the reckless fellow who had wrought their father this mischief, for he had reason to believe Antyllus the perpetrator of the deed, and a collision between the youths and the son of Antony could only result in fresh disaster to him and his, especially as the young Roman seemed to have inherited little of his father's magnanimous generosity. Yet Arius could not be vexed with his sons for stigmatizing, in the harshest terms, the conduct of the man who had gone on without heeding the accident.  He had cautioned his sister against the utterly unbridled youth whose father he had himself brought to her house.  With what good reason he had raised his voice in warning was now evident.  At sunset that very day several guests had arrived as usual, followed by Antyllus, a youth of nineteen.  When the door-keeper refused to admit him, he had rudely demanded to see Barine, thrust aside the prudent old porter, who endeavoured to detain him, and, in spite of his protestations, forced his way into his dead master's work-room, where the ladies usually received their visitors.  Not until he found it empty would he retire, and then he first fastened a bouquet of flowers he had brought to a statue of Eros in burnt clay, which stood there.  Both the porter and Barine's waiting-maid declared that he was drunk; they saw it when he staggered away with the companions who had waited for him in the garden outside.  This unseemly and insulting conduct filled Berenike with the deepest indignation.  It must not remain unpunished, and, while waiting for her daughter, she imagined what evil consequences might ensue if Antyllus were forbidden the house and accused to his tutor, and how unbearable, on the other hand, he might become if they omitted to do so.  She was full of sad presentiments, and as, with such good reason, she feared the worst, she cherished a faint hope that her daughter might perhaps bring home some pleasant tidings; for she had had the experience that events which had filled her with the utmost anxiety sometimes resulted in good fortune.  At last Barine appeared, and it was indeed long since she had clasped her mother in her arms with such joyous cheerfulness.  The widow's troubled heart grew lighter.  Her daughter must have met with something unusually gratifying, she looked so happy, although she had surely heard what had happened here; for her cloak was laid aside and her hair newly arranged, so she must have been to her chamber, where she was dressed by her loquacious Cyprian slave, who certainly could not keep to herself anything that was worth mentioning.  The nimble maid had shown her skill that day.  \"Any stranger would take her for nineteen,\" thought her mother.  \"How becoming the white robe and blue-bordered peplum are to her; how softly the azure bombyx ribbon is wound around the thick waves of her hair!  Who would believe that no curling-irons had touched the little golden locks that rest so gracefully on her brow, that no paint-brush had any share in producing the rose and white hues on her cheek, or the alabaster glimmer of her arms?  Such beauty easily becomes a Danae dower; but it is a magnificent gift of the gods!  Yet why did she put on the bracelet which Antony gave her after his last visit?  Scarcely on my account.  She can hardly expect Dion at so late an hour.  Even while I am rejoicing in the sight of her beauty, some new misfortune may be impending."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5474"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 02 (#1)"],["body","\"  So ran the current of her thoughts while her daughter was gaily describing what she had witnessed at her grandfather's.  Meanwhile she had nestled comfortably among the cushions of a lounge; and when she mentioned Antyllus's unseemly conduct, she spoke of it, with a carelessness that startled Berenike, as a vexatious piece of rudeness which must not occur again.  \"But who is to prevent it?\" asked the mother anxiously.  \"Who, save ourselves?\" replied Barine.  \"He will not be admitted.\"  \"And if he forced his way in?\"  Barine's big blue eyes flashed angrily, and there was no lack of decision in her voice as she exclaimed, \"Let him try it!\"  \"But what power have we to restrain the son of Antony?\" asked Berenike. \"I do not know.\"  \"I do,\" replied her daughter.  \"I will be brief, for a visitor is coming.\"  \"So late?\" asked the mother anxiously.  \"Archibius wishes to discuss an important matter with us.\"  The lines on the brow of the older woman smoothed, but it contracted again as she exclaimed inquiringly: \"Important business at so unusual an hour!  Ah, I have expected nothing good since early morning!  On my way to my brother's a raven flew up before me and fluttered towards the left into the garden.\"  \"But I,\" replied Barine, after receiving, in reply to her inquiry, a favourable report concerning her uncle's health-\"I met seven--there were neither more nor less; for seven is the best of numbers--seven snow-white doves, which all flew swiftly towards the right.  The fairest of all came first, bearing in its beak a little basket which contained the power that will keep Antony's son away from us.  Don't look at me in such amazement, you dear receptacle of every terror.\"  \"But, child, you said that Archibius was coming so late to discuss an important matter,\" rejoined the mother.  \"He must be here soon.\"  \"Then cease this talking in riddles; I do not guess them quickly.\"  \"You will solve this one,\" returned Barine; \"but we really have no time to lose.  So-my beautiful dove was a good, wise thought, and what it carried in its basket you shall hear presently.  You see, mother, many will blame us, though here and there some one may pity; but this state of things must not continue.  I feel it more and more plainly with each passing day; and several years must yet elapse ere this scruple becomes wholly needless.  I am too young to welcome as a guest every one whom this or that man presents to me.  True, our reception-hall was my father's work-room and you, my own estimable, blameless mother, are the hostess here; but though superior to me in every respect, you are so modest that you shield yourself behind your daughter until the guests think of you only when you are absent.  So those who  seek us both merely say, 'I am going to visit Barine'--and there are too many who say this-- I can no longer choose, and this thought--\"  \"Child!  child!\" interrupted her mother joyfully, \"what god met you as you went out this morning?\"  \"Surely you know,\" she answered gaily; \"it was seven doves, and, when I took the little basket from the bill of the first and prettiest one, it told me a story.  Do you want to hear it?\"  \"Yes, yes; but be quick, or we shall be interrupted.\"  Then Barine leaned farther back among the cushions, lowered her long lashes, and began: \"Once upon a time there was a woman who had a garden in the most aristocratic quarter of the city--here near the Paneum, if you please.  In the autumn, when the fruit was ripening, she left the gate open, though all her neighbours did the opposite.  To keep away unbidden lovers of her nice figs and dates, she fastened on the gate a tablet bearing the inscription: 'All may enter and enjoy the sight of the garden; but the dogs will bite any one who breaks a flower, treads upon the grass, or steals the fruit.'  \"The woman had nothing but a lap-dog, and that did not always obey her. But the tablet fulfilled its purpose; for at first none came except her neighbours in the aristocratic quarter.  They read the threat, and probably without it would have respected the property of the woman who so kindly opened the door to them.  Thus matters went on for a time, until first a beggar came, and then a Phoenician sailor, and a thievish Egyptian from the Rhakotis--neither of whom could read.  So the tablet told them nothing; and as, moreover, they distinguished less carefully between mine and thine, one trampled the turf and another snatched from the boughs a flower or fruit.  More and more of the rabble came, and you can imagine what followed.  No one punished them for the crime, for they did not fear the barking of the lap-dog, and this gave even those who could read, courage not to heed the warning.  So the woman's pretty garden soon lost its peculiar charm; and the fruit, too, was stolen. When the rain at last washed the inscription from the tablet, and saucy boys scrawled on it, there was no harm done; for the garden no longer offered any attractions, and no one who looked into it cared to enter. Then the owner closed her gate like the neighbours, and the next year she again enjoyed the green grass and the bright hues of the flowers.  She ate her fruit herself, and the lap-dog no longer disturbed her by its barking.\"  \"That is,\" said her mother, \"if everybody was as courteous and as well bred as Gorgias, Lysias, and the others, we would gladly continue to receive them.  But since there are rude fellows like Antyllus--\"  \"You have understood the story correctly,\" Barine interrupted.  \"We are certainly at liberty to invite to our house those who have learned to read our inscription.  To-morrow visitors will be informed that we can no longer receive them as before.\"  \"Antyllus's conduct affords an excellent pretext,\" her mother added. \"Every fair-minded person must understand--\"  \"Certainly,\" said Barine, \"and if you, shrewdest of women, will do your part--  \"Then for the first time we can act as we please in our own home. Believe me, child--if you only do not--\"  \"No ifs!--not this time!\" cried the young beauty, raising her hand beseechingly.  \"It gives me such delight to think of the new life, and if matters come to pass as I hope and wish--then--do not you also believe, mother, that the gods owe me reparation?\"  \"For what?\" asked the deep voice of Archibius, who had entered unannounced, and was now first noticed by the widow and her daughter.  Barine hastily rose and held out both hands to her old friend, exclaiming, \"Since they bring you to us, they are already beginning the payment.\"     CHAPTER V.  An artist, especially a great artist, finds it easy to give his house an attractive appearance.  He desires comfort in it, and only the beautiful is comfortable to him.  Whatever would disturb harmony offends his eye, and to secure the noblest ornament of his house he need not invite any stranger to cross its threshold.  The Muse, the best of assistants, joins him unbidden.  Leonax, Barine's father, had been thus aided to transform the interior of his house into a very charming residence.  He had painted on the walls of his own work-room incidents in the life of Alexander the Great, the founder of his native city, and on the frieze a procession of dancing Cupids.  Here Barine now received her guests, and the renown of these paintings was not one of the smallest inducements which had led Antony to visit the young beauty and to take his son, in whom he wished to awaken at least a fleeting pleasure in art.  He also knew how to prize her beauty and her singing, but the ardent passion which had taken possession of him in his mature years was for Cleopatra alone.  He whose easily won heart and susceptible fancy had urged him from one commonplace love to another had been bound by the Queen with chains of indestructible and supernatural power.  By her side a Barine seemed to him merely a work of art endowed with life and a voice that charmed the ear.  Yet he owed her some pleasant hours, and he could not help bestowing gifts upon any one to whom he was indebted for anything pleasant.  He liked to be considered the most generous spendthrift on earth, and the polished bracelet set with a gem, on which was carved Apollo playing on his lyre, surrounded by the listening Muses, looked very simple, but was really an ornament of priceless value, for the artist who made it was deemed the best stone- cutter in Alexandria in the time of Philadelphus, and each one of the tiny figures sculptured on the bit of onyx scarcely three fingers wide was a carefully executed masterpiece of the most exquisite beauty. Antony had chosen it because he deemed it a fitting gift for the woman whose song had pleased him.  He had not thought of asking its value; indeed, only a connoisseur would have perceived it; and as the circlet was not showy and well became her beautiful arm, Barine liked to wear it.  Had not the war taken him away, Antony's second visit would certainly not have been his last.  Besides the singing which enthralled him, the conversation had been gay and brilliant, and in addition to Leonax's paintings, he had seen other beautiful works of art which the former had obtained by exchanging with many distinguished companions.  Nor was there any lack of plastic creations in the spacious apartment, to which the flashing of the water poured by a powerful man from the goatskin bottle on his shoulder into a shell lent a special charm.  The master who had carved this stooping Nubian had also created the much- discussed statues of the royal lovers.  The clay Eros, who with bent knee was aiming at a victim visible to himself alone, was also his work. Antony, when paying his second visit, had laughingly laid the garland he wore before \"the greatest of human conquerors,\" while a short time ago his son Antyllus had rudely thrust his bouquet of flowers into the opening of the curved right arm which was drawing the string.  In doing so the statue had been injured.  Now the flowers lay unheeded upon the little altar at"]]]
