As soon as Philippus had quitted the house, Orion went to see Rufinus, who, on his briefly assuring him that he had come on grave and important business, begged him to accompany him to his private room.  The young man, however, detained him till he had made all clear with the women as to the reception of little Mary.  \"By degrees all the inhabitants of the residence will be transplanted into our garden!\"  exclaimed Rufinus.  \"Well, I have no objection; and you, old woman, what do you say to it?\"  \"I have none certainly,\" replied his wife.  \"Besides, neither you nor I have to decide in this case: the child is to be Paula's guest.\"  \"I only wish she were here already,\" said Paula, \"for who can say whether your mother, Orion--the air here is perilously Melchite.\"  \"Leave Philippus and me to settle that.--You should have seen how pleased Mary was.\"  Then, drawing Paula aside, he hastily added:  \"Have I not hoped too much?  Is your heart mine?  Come what may, can I count on you--on your lov-?\"  \"Yes, Yes!\"  The words rushed up from the very bottom of her heart, and Orion, with a sigh of relief, followed the old man, glad and comforted.  The study was lighted up, and there, without mentioning Katharina, he told Rufinus of the patriarch's scheme for dispersing the nuns of St. Cecilia.  What could he care for these Melchite sisters?  But, since that consoling hour in the church, he felt as though it were his duty to stand forth for all that was right, and to do battle against everything that was base.  Besides, he knew how warmly and steadfastly his father had taken the part of this very convent against the patriarch.  Finally, he had heard how strongly his beloved was attached to this retreat and its superior, so he prepared himself gleefully to come forth a new man of deeds, and show his prowess.  The old man listened with growing surprise and horror, and when Orion had finished his story he rose, helplessly wringing his hands.  Orion spoke to him encouragingly, and told him that he had come, not merely to give the terrible news, but to hold council with him as to how the innocent victims might be rescued.  At this the grey-headed philanthropist and wanderer pricked up his ears; and as an old war horse, though harnessed to the plough, when he hears the trumpet sound lifts his head and arches his neck as proudly and nobly as of yore under his glittering trappings, so Rufinus drew himself up, his old eyes sparkled, and he exclaimed with all the enthusiasm and eagerness of youth:  \"Very good, very good;  I am with you;  not merely as an adviser; no, no. Head, and hand, and foot, from crown to heel!  And as for you, young man --as for you!  I always saw the stuff that was in you in spite--in spite. --But, as surely as man is the standard of all things, those who reach the stronghold of virtue by a winding road are often better citizens than those who are born in it.--It is growing late, but evensong will not yet have begun and I shall still be able to see the abbess.  Have you any plan to propose?\"  \"Yes; the day after to-morrow at this hour. . . .\"  \"And why not to-morrow?\"  interrupted the ardent old man.  \"Because I have preparations to make which cannot be done in twelve hours of daylight.\"  \"Good! Good!\"  \"The day after to-morrow at dusk, a large barge--not one of ours--will be lying by the bank at the foot of the convent garden.  I will escort the sisters as far as Doomiat on the Lake.  I will send on a mounted messenger to-night, and I will charter a ship for the fugitives by the help of my cousin Columella, the greatest ship-owner of that town.  That will take them over seas wherever the abbess may command.\"  \"Capital, splendid!\"  cried Rufinus enthusiastically.  He took up his hat and stick, and the radiant expression of his face changed to a very grave one.  He went up to the young man with solemn dignity, looked at him with fatherly kindliness, and said:  \"I know what woes befell your house through those of our confession, the fellow-believers of these whom you propose to protect with so much prudence and courage; and that, young man, is noble, nay, is truly great. I find in you--you who were described to me as a man of the world and not over-precise--for the first time that which I have sought in vain for many years and in many lands, among the pious and virtuous: the spirit of willing self-sacrifice to save an enemy of a different creed from pressing peril.--But you are young, Orion, and I am old.  You triumph in the action only, I foresee the consequences.  Do you know what lies before you, if it should be discovered that you have covered the escape of the prey whom the patriarch already sees in his net?  Have you considered that Benjamin, the most implacable and most powerful hater among the Jacobites, will pursue you as his mortal foe with all the fearful means at his command?\"  \"I have considered it,\" replied Orion.  Rufinus laid his left hand on the young man's shoulder, and his right hand on his head, saying,  \"Then take with you, to begin with, an old man's--a father's blessing.\"  \"Yes, a father's,\" repeated Orion softly.  A happy thrill ran through his body and soul, and he fell on the old man's neck deeply moved.  For a minute they stood clasped in each other's arms; then Rufinus freed himself, and set out to seek the abbess.  Orion returned to the women, whose curiosity had been roused to a high pitch by seeing Rufinus disappear through the gate leading to the convent-garden.  Dame Joanna could not sit still for excitement, and Pulcheria answered at random when Orion and Paula, who had an infinity of things to say or whisper to each other, now and then tried to draw her into the conversation.  Once she sighed deeply, and when her friend asked her: \"What ails you, Child?\" she answered anxiously:  \"Something serious must be going forward, I feel it.  If only Philippus were here!\"  \"But we are all safe and well, thank God!\"  observed Orion, and she quickly replied:  \"Yes indeed, the Lord be praised!\"  But she thought to herself:  \"You think he is of no use but to heal the sick; but it is only when he is here that everything goes right and happens for the best!\"  Still, all felt that there was something unusual and ominous in the air, and when the old man presently returned his face confirmed their suspicions.  He laid aside his hat and staff in speechless gravity; then he put his arm affectionately round his wife and said:  \"You will need all your courage and self-command once more, as you have often done before, good wife; I have taken upon myself a serious duty.\"  Joanna had turned very pale, and while she clung to her husband and begged him to speak and not to torture her with suspense, her frail figure was trembling, and bitter tears ran down her cheeks.  She could guess that her husband was once more going away from her and their child, in the service and for the benefit of others, and she knew full well that she could not prevent it.  If she could, she never would have had the heart to interfere: for she always understood him, and felt with him that something to take him out of the narrow circle of home-life was indispensable to his happiness.  He read her thoughts, and they gave him pain; but he was not to be diverted from his purpose.  The man who would try to heal every suffering brute was accustomed to see those whom he loved best grieve on his account.  Marriage, he would say, ought not to hinder a man in following his soul's vocation; and he was fond of using this high-sounding name to justify himself in his own and his wife's eyes, in doing things to which he was prompted only by restlessness and unsatisfied energy.  Without this he would, no doubt, have done his best for the imperilled sisterhood, but it added to his enjoyment of the grand and dangerous rescue.  The wretched fate of the hapless nuns, and the thought of losing them as near neighbors, grieved the women deeply, and the men saw many tears flow; at the same time they had the satisfaction of finding them all three firmly and equally determined to venture all, and to bid these whom they loved venture all, to hinder the success of a deed which filled them with horror and disgust.  Joanna spoke not a word of demur when Rufinus said that he intended to accompany the fugitives; and when, with beaming looks, he went on to praise Orion's foresight and keen decisiveness, Paula flew to him proudly and gladly, holding out both her hands.  As for the young man, he felt as though wings were growing from his shoulders, and this fateful evening was one of the happiest of his life.  The superior had agreed to his scheme, and in some details had improved upon it.  Two lay sisters and one nun should remain behind.  The two former were to attend to the sick in the infirmary, to ring the bell and chant the services as usual, that the escape of the rest might not be suspected; and Joanna, Paula, and Pulcheria, were to assist them.  When, at a late hour, Orion was about to leave, Rufinus asked whether, under these circumstances, it would be well to bring Mary to his house; he himself doubted it.  Joanna was of his opinion; Paula, on the contrary, said that she believed it would be better to let the child run the risk of a remote danger--hardly to be called danger, than to leave her to pine away body and soul in her old home.  Pulcheria supported her, but the two girls were forced to yield to the decision of the elders.

D.W.]      THE BRIDE OF THE NILE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 8.    CHAPTER V.  After that interview with Orion, Philippus hurried off through the town, paying so little heed to the people he met and to the processions besieging Heaven with loud psalms to let the Nile at last begin to rise, that he ran up against more than one passer-by, and had many a word of abuse shouted after him.  He went into two or three houses, and neither his patients nor their attendants could recognize, in this abrupt and hasty visitor, the physician and friend who was usually so sympathetic to the  sufferer:  who  would  speak  with  a cordiality that brought new life to his heart, who would toss the children in the air, kiss one and nod merrily to another.  To-day their elders even felt shy and anxious in his presence.  For the first time he found the duty he loved a wearisome burthen; the sick man was a tormenting spirit in league with the world against his peace of mind.  What possessed him, that he should feel such love of his fellow-men as to deprive himself of all comfort in life and of his night's rest for their sake?  Rufinus was right.  In these times each man lived solely to spite his neighbor, and he who could be most brazenly selfish, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, was the most certain to get on in life.  Fool that he was to let other folks' woes destroy his peace and hinder him in his scientific advancement!  Tormented by such bitter thoughts as these, he went into a neat little house by the harbor where a worthy pilot lay dying, surrounded by his wife and children; and there, at once, he was himself again, putting forth all his knowledge and heartfelt kindliness, quitting the scene with a bleeding heart and an empty purse; but no sooner was he out of doors than his former mood closed in upon him with double gloom.  The case was plain: Even with the fixed determination not to sacrifice himself for others he could not help doing it; the impulse was too strong for him. He could no more help suffering with the sufferer, and giving the best he had to give with no hope of a return, than the drunkard can help drinking.  He was made to be plundered; it was his fate!  With a drooping head he returned to his old friend's work-room. Horapollo was sitting, just as he had sat the night before, at his writing-table with his scrolls and his three lamps, a slave below, snoring while he awaited his master's pleasure.  The leech's pretty Greek greeting \"Rejoice !\"  sounded rather like \"May you choke!\" as he flung aside his upper garment; and to the old man's answer and anxious exclamation: \"How badly you look, Philip!\"  he answered crossly: \"Like a man who deserves a kick rather than a welcome; a booby who has submitted to have his nose pulled; a cur who has licked the hand of the lout who has thrashed him!\"  He threw himself on the divan and told Horapollo all that had passed between him and Orion.  \"And the maddest part of it all,\" he ended, \"is that I almost like the man; that he really seems to me to be on the high road to become a capital fellow; and that I no longer feel inclined to pitch him into a lime-kiln at the mere thought of his putting out a hand to Paula.  At the same time,\" and he started to his feet, \"even if I help him to bring the poor little girl away from that demented old hag, I cannot and will not continue to be her physician.  There are plenty of quacks about in this corpse of a town, and they may find one of them.  \"You will continue to treat the child,\" interrupted the old man quietly.  \"To have my heart daily flogged with nettles!\" exclaimed the leech, going towards Horapollo with wild gesticulations.  \"And do you believe that I have any desire to meet that young fellow's sweetheart day after day, often twice a day, that the barb may be twisted round and round in my bleeding wound?\"  \"I expect a quite different result from your frequent meeting,\" said the other.  \"You will get accustomed to see her under the aspect which alone she can hence forth bear to you: that of a handsome girl--there are thousands such in Egypt,--and the betrothed of another.\"  \"Certainly, if my heart were like a hunting-dog that lies down the moment it is bid,\" said Philippus with a scornful laugh.  \"The end of it is that I must go away, away from Memphis--away from this miserable world for all I care!  I?--Recover my peace of mind within reach of her?  Alas, for my blissful, lost peace!\"  \"And why not?  To every man a thing is only as he conceives of it.  Only listen to me: I had finished a treatise on the old and new Calendars, and my master desired me to deliver a lecture on it in the Museum--if the school of pedants in Alexandria now deserves the name; but I did not wish to do so because I knew that the presence of such a large and learned audience would embarrass me.  But my master advised me to imagine that my hearers were not men, but mere cabbages.  This gave me new light; I took his advice, got over my shyness, and my speech flowed like oil.\"  \"A very good story,\" said Philippus, \"but I do not see...\"  \"The moral of it for you,\" interrupted the old man, \"is that you must regard the supremely adorable lady of your love as one among a dozen others--I will not say as a cabbage--as one with whom your heart has no more concern.  Put a little strength of will into it, and you will succeed.\"  \"If a heart were a cipher, and if passion were calendar-making! . . .\" retorted Philippus.  \"You are a very wise man, and your manuscripts and tables have stood like walls between you and passion.\"  \"Who can tell?\"  said Horapollo.  \"But at any rate, it never should have had such power over me as to make me embitter the few remaining days under the sun yet granted to my father and friend for the sake of a woman who scorned my devotion.  Will you promise me to talk no more nonsense about flying from Memphis, or anything of the kind?\"  \"Teach me first to measure my strength of will.\"  \"Will you try, at any rate?\"  \"Yes, for your sake.\"  \"Will you promise to continue your treatment of that poor little girl, whom I love dearly in spite of her forbears?\"  \"As long as I can endure the daily meeting with her--you know.  .  .\"  \"That, then, is a bargain.--Now, come and let us translate a few more chapters.\"  The friends sat at work together till a late hour, and when the old man was alone again he reflected: \"So long as he can be of use to the child he will not go away, and by that time I shall have dug a pit for that damned siren.\"                      .........................  Orion had his hands full of work for the next morning.  Before it was light he sent off two trustworthy messengers to Doomiat, giving each of them a letter with instructions that a sailing vessel should be held in readiness for the fugitives.  One was to start three hours after the other, so that the business in hand should not fail if either of them should come to grief.  He then went out; first to the harbor, where he succeeded in hiring a large, good Nile-boat from Doomiat, whose captain, a trustworthy and experienced man, promised to keep their agreement a secret and to be prepared to start by noon next day.  Next, after taking council with himself, he went to the treasurer's office, and there, with the assistance of Nilus, made his will, to be ratified and signed next morning in the presence of a notary and witnesses.  His mother, little Mary, and Paula were to inherit the bulk of his property.  He also bequeathed a considerable sum as a legacy to the hospitals and orphan asylums, as well as to the Church, to the end that they might pray for his soul; and a legacy to Nilus \"as the most just judge of his household.\"  Eudoxia, Mary's Greek governess, was not forgotten; and finally he commanded that all his house-slaves should be liberated, and to the end that they might not suffer from want he bequeathed to them one of his largest estates in Upper Egypt, where they might settle and labor for their common good.  He increased the handsome sums already devised by his father to the freedmen of his family.  This business occupied several hours.  Nilus, who wrote while Orion dictated, giving the document a legal form, was deeply touched by the young man's fore thought and kindness;  for in truth, since his desecration of the judgment-seat, he had given him up for a lost soul.  By Orion's orders this will was to be opened after four weeks, in case he should not have returned from a journey on which he proposed starting on the morrow, and this injunction revealed to the faithful steward, who had grown grey in the service, that the last scion of the house expected to run considerable risk; however, he was too modest to ask any questions, and his master did not take him into his confidence.  When, after all this, the two men went back into the anteroom, Anubis, the young clerk and Katharina's ally, was standing there.  Nilus took no notice of him, and while he, with tearful eyes, stooped to kiss the hand Orion held out to him as he bid him come to take leave of him once more next evening, Anubis, who had withdrawn respectfully to a little distance, keeping his ears open, however, officiously opened the heavy iron-plated door.  Orion was exhausted and hungry; he enquired for his mother, and hearing that she had gone to lie down, he went into the dining-room to get some food.  Although breakfast had but just been served, Eudoxia was awaiting him with evident impatience.  Her heart was bursting with a great piece of news, and as Orion entered, greeting her, she cried out:  \"Have you heard?  Do you know?\"  Then she began, encouraged by his curt negative, to pour out to him how that Neforis, by the desire of the physician who had lately been"]]]
