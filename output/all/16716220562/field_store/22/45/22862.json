Her father must certainly have been an official of some rank, and probably, as it would seem, a Roman citizen, in which case--as Porphyrius agreed-- both the young girl and her little brother could legally claim their freedom.  The insurgents who had dragged the two children out into the street had been driven off by the troops, and it was from them that Karnis had rescued them.  \"And I have never regretted it,\" added the old musician, \"for Agne is a sweet, gentle soul.  Of her voice I need say nothing, since you yourselves heard it yesterday.\"  \"And were quite delighted with it!\"  cried Gorgo.  \"If flowers could sing it would be like that!\"  \"Well, well,\" said Karnis.  \"She has a lovely voice--but she wants wings. Something--what, I know not, keeps the violet rooted to the soil.\"  \"Christian scruples,\" said the merchant, and Damia added:  \"Let Eros touch her--that will loosen her tongue.\"  \"Eros, always Eros!\"  repeated Gorgo shrugging her shoulders.  \"Nay, love means suffering--those who love drag a chain with them.  To do the best of which he is capable man needs only to be free, true, and in health.\"  \"That is a great deal, fair mistress,\" replied Karnis eagerly.  \"With these three gifts the best work is done.  But as to Agne--what can be further from freedom than a girl bound to service? her body, to be sure is healthy, but her spirit suffers; she can get no peace for dread of the Christian's terrors: Sin, Repentance, and Hell. . . .\"  \"Oh, we know how their life is ruined!\" interrupted the old lady. \"Was it Agne who introduced you to Mary's Asylum?\"  \"No, noble lady.\"  \"But how then--that  prudent  saint  generally selects her guests, and those that are not baptized . . .\"  \"She certainly sheltered heathens on this occasion.\"  \"I am much surprised.  Tell me how it happened.\"  \"We were at Rome,\" began Karnis, \"and my patron there persuaded Marcus, Mary's son, to take us on board his ship at Ostia.  We dropped anchor at Cyrene, where the young master wanted to pick up his brother and bring him also to Alexandria.\"  \"Then is Demetrius here?\"  asked Porphyrius.  \"Yes, sir.  He came on board at Cyrene.  Hardly had we got fairly to sea again when we saw two pirate ships.  Our trireme was at once turned round, but in our hurry to regain the harbor we stuck fast on a sand bank; the boats were at once put out to save the passengers and Cynegius, the consul. . .\"  \"Cynegius--on his way here!\"  exclaimed Porphyrius, much excited.  \"He landed yesterday with us in the harbor of Eunostus.  The secretaries and officers of his suite filled one boat and Marcus and his brother were getting into the other with their men.  We, and others of the free passengers, should have been left behind if Dada . . .\"  \"That pretty little blonde?\"  asked Damia.  \"The very same.  Marcus had taken a great fancy to her prattle and her songs during the voyage--no nightingale can sing more clearly--and when she begged and prayed him he gave way at once, and said: he would take her in his boat.  But the brave child declared that she would jump into the sea before she would leave without us.\"  \"Well done!\"  cried the old lady, and Porphyrius added:  \"That speaks well for her and for you.\"  \"So after all Marcus found room for us in the boat--for all of us, and we got safely to land.  A few days after we all came on in a troop-ship: Cynegius, the two brothers and the rest, all safe and sound; and, as we had lost everything we possessed, Marcus gave us a certificate which procured our admission into his mother's Xenodochium.  And then the gods brought me and mine under the notice of your noble daughter.\"  \"Then Cynegius is here, positively here?\"  asked Porphyrius once more. Karnis assured him that he was, and the merchant, turning to his mother, went on:  \"And Olympius has not yet come home.  It is always the same thing; he is as rash as a boy.  If they should take him!  The roads are swarming with monks.  There is something astir.  Bring out the chariot, Syrus, at once; and tell Atlas to be ready to accompany me.  Cynegius here!--Ha, ha! I thank the gods!\"  The last exclamation was addressed to a man who at this instant came into the room, muffled up to the eyes.  He threw off the hood of his cloak and the wrapper that went round his throat, concealing his long white beard, and as he did so he exclaimed with a gasp for breath:  \"Here I am once more!--Cynegius is here and matters look serious my friend.\"  \"You have been to the Museum?\"  \"Without any obstruction.  I found them all assembled.  Brave lads.  They are all for us and the gods.  There are plenty of weapons.  The Jews-- [At that time about two-fifths of the whole population.]--are not stirring, Onias thinks he may vouch for that; and we must surely be a match for the monks and the imperial cohorts.\"  \"If the gods only stand by us to-day and tomorrow,\" replied Porphyrius doubtfully.  \"For ever, if only the country people do their duty!\"  cried the other. \"But who is this stranger?\"  \"The chief of the singers who were here yesterday,\" replied Gorgo.  \"Karnis, the son of Hiero of Tauromenium,\" said the musician, bowing to the stranger, whose stately figure and handsome, thoughtful head struck him with admiration.  \"Karnis of Tauromenium!\" exclaimed the newcomer with glad surprise. \"By Hercules! a strange meeting.  Your hand, your hand, old man.  How many years is it since we last emptied a wine-jar together at the house of old Hippias?  Seven lustres have turned our hair grey, but we still can stand upright.  Well, Karnis son of Hiero--and who am I?\"  \"Olympius--the great Olympius!\"  cried Karnis, eagerly grasping the offered hand.  \"May all the gods bless this happy day!\"  \"All the gods?\"  repeated the philosopher.  \"Is that what you say?  Then you have not crawled under the yoke of the cross?\"  \"The world can rejoice only under the auspices of the gods!\"  cried Karnis excitedly.  \"And it shall rejoice still, we will  save it  from gloom!\"  added the other with a flash of vehemence.  \"The times are fateful.  We must fight; and no longer over trifles; we cannot now break each other's heads over a quibble, or believe that the whole world hangs on the question whether the instant of death is the last minute of this life or the first of the next.  No--what now remains to be decided is whether the old gods shall be victorious, whether we shall continue to live free and happy under the rule of the Immortals, or whether we shall bow under the dismal doctrine of the carpenter's crucified son; we must fight for the highest hopes and aims of humanity.\"  \"I know,\" interrupted Karnis, \"you have already done battle valiantly for great Serapis.  They wanted to lay hands on his sanctuary but you and your disciples put them to rout.  The rest got off scot-free .  .  .\"  \"But they have taught me the value of my head,\" said Olympius laughing. \"Evagrius prices it at three talents.  Why, you might buy a house with the money and a modest man could live upon the interest.  This worthy man keeps me concealed here.  We must talk over a few things, Porphyrius; and you, Gorgo, do not forget the solemn festival of Isis.  Now that Cynegius is here it must be made as splendid as possible, and he must tell the Emperor, who has sent him, what temper we Alexandrians are in.  But where is the dark maiden I saw yesterday?\"  \"In the garden,\" replied Gorgo.  \"She is to sing at the foot of the bier!\" cried Olympius.  \"That must not be altered.\"  \"If I can persuade her--she is a Christian,\" said Karnis doubtfully.  \"She must,\" said the philosopher positively.  \"It will be a bad lookout indeed for the logic and rhetoric of Alexandria if an old professor and disputant cannot succeed in turning a young girl's resolutions upside down.  Leave that to me.  I shall find time for a chat with you by and bye, friend Karnis.  How in the world does it happen that you, who so often have helped us with your father's coin, have come down to be the chief of a band of travelling musicians?  You will have much to tell me, my good friend; but even such important matters must give way to those that are more pressing.  One word with you, Porphyrius.\"  Agne had been all this time awaiting Herse's return in the colonnade that ran along the garden-front of the house.  She was glad to be alone, and it was very comfortable to rest on the soft cushions under the gilt- coffered ceiling of the arcade.  At each end stood large shrubs covered with bunches of violet-blue flowers and the spreading branches cast a pleasant shade on the couch where she sat; the beautiful flowers, which were strange to her, were delightfully fragrant, and from time to time she helped herself to the refreshments which Gorgo herself had brought out to her.  All she saw, heard, and felt, was soothing to her mind; never had she seen or tasted juicier peaches, richer bunches of grapes, fresher almonds or more tempting cakes; on the shrubs in the garden and on the grass-plots between the paths there was not a dead leaf, not a dry stem, not the tiniest weed.  The buds were swelling on the tall trees, shrubs without end were covered with blossoms--white, blue,  yellow, and red--while, among the smooth, shining leaves of the orange and lemon trees, gleamed the swelling fruit.  On a round tank close at hand some black swans were noiselessly tracing evanescent circles and uttering their strange lament.  The song of birds mingled with the plash of fountains, and even the marble statues, for all that they were dumb, seemed to be enjoying the sweet morning air and the stir and voice of nature.  Yes, she could be happy here; as she peeled a peach and slowly swallowed the soft fragrant mouthfuls, she laughed to remember the hard ship's- biscuit, of the two previous days' fare.  And it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5501"],["title","Serapis â€” Volume 01 (#6)"],["body","Gorgo's privilege to revel in these good things day after day, year after year.  It was like living in Eden, in the perpetual spring of man's first blissful home on earth.  There could be no suffering here; who could cry here, who could be sorrowful, who could die? . . .  Here a new train of thought forced itself upon her.  She was still so young, and yet she was as familiar with the idea of death as she was with life; for whenever she had happened to tell any minister of her creed that she was an orphan and a slave, and deeply sad and sorrowful, the joys of eternity in Paradise had always been described to her for her consolation, and it was in hopes of Heaven that her visionary nature found such a modicum of comfort as might suffice to keep the young artist-soul from despair.  And now it struck her that it must be hard, very hard to die, in the midst of all this splendor.  Living here must be a foretaste of the joys of Paradise-- and in the next world, among the angels of Heaven, in the presence of the Saviour--would it not be a thousand times more beautiful even than this? She shuddered, for, sojourning here, she was no longer to be counted as one of the poor and humble sufferers to whom Christ had promised the Kingdom of Heaven--here she was one of the rich, who had nothing to hope for after death.  She pushed the peaches away with a feeling of oppression, and closed her eyes that she might no longer see all these perishable splendors and sinful works of the heathen, which pandered only to the senses. She longed to remain miserable and poor on earth, that she might rejoin her parents and dwell with them eternally.  To her it was not a belief but a certainty that her father and mother were dwelling in Heaven, and she had often felt moved to pray that she might die and be reunited to them; but she must not die yet, for her little brother still needed her care.  The kind souls whom she served let him lack for nothing, it is true, that could conduce to his bodily welfare; still, she could not appear before her parents without the little one in her hand, and he would be lost eternally if his soul fell into the power of the enemies of her faith.  Her heart ached when she reflected that Karnis, who was certainly not one of the reprobate and whom she affectionately revered as a master in the art she loved--that Herse, and the light-hearted Dada, and Orpheus even, must all be doomed to perish eternally; and to save Orpheus she would willingly have forfeited half the joys of Paradise.  She saw that he was no less an idolater than his parents; and yet, day by day, she prayed that his soul might be saved, and she never ceased to hope for a miracle--that he too might see a vision, like Paul, and confess the Saviour.  She was so happy when she was with him, and never happier than when it was her fortune to sing with him, or to his admirable accompaniment on the lute.  When she could succeed in forgetting herself completely, and in giving utterance by her lovely voice to all that was highest and best in her soul, he, whose ear was no less sensitive and appreciative than his father's, would frankly express his approval, and in these moments life was indeed fair and precious.  Music was the bond between her and Orpheus, and when her soul was stirred she could feel and express herself in music.  Song was the language of her heart, and she had learnt by experience that it was a language which even the heathen could both use and understand.  The Eternal Father himself must find joy in such a voice as Gorgo's.  She was a heathen, and yet she had thrown into her song all that Agne herself could feel when she lifted up her heart in passionate prayer.  The Christian--so she had often been taught--must have no part with the idolaters; but it was God himself who had cast her on the hands of Karnis, and the Church commanded that servants should obey their masters.  Singing seemed to her to be a language in itself, bestowed by God on all living creatures, even on the birds, wherein to speak to Him; so she allowed herself to look forward with pleasure to an opportunity of mingling her own voice with that of the heathen lady.     CHAPTER IV.  Not long after Porphyrius and the philosopher had retired to a private room Herse returned with Dada.  Gorgo's blue spangled dress, which Damia had sent her, suited the girl to perfection; but she was quite out of breath, and her hair was in disorder.  Herse, too, looked agitated, her face was red and she dragged little Papias, whose hand she held, rather roughly at her heels.  Dada was evidently abashed; less by reason of the splendor that surrounded her than because her foster-mother had strictly enjoined her to be very quiet and mannerly in the presence of their patrons.  She felt shy and strange as she made her low courtesy to the old lady; but Damia seemed to be pleased with the timid grace of her demeanor, for she offered her her hand--an honor she usually conferred only on her intimates, bid her stoop, and gave her a kiss, saying kindly: \"You are a good brave girl.  Fidelity to your friends is pleasing in the sight of the gods, and finds its reward even among men.\"  Dada, obeying a happy impulse, threw herself on her knees before the old woman, kissed her hands, and then, sitting on her heels, nestled at her feet.  Gorgo, however, noticing Herse's agitation, asked what had happened to them.  Some monks, Herse explained, had followed them on the road hither, had snatched Dada's lyre from the slave who was carrying it and pulled the wreath out of her hair.  Damia was furious as she heard it, and trembled with rage as she railed at the wild hordes who disgraced and desecrated Alexandria, the sacred home of the Muses; then she began to speak once more of the young captain, Mary's son, to whom the troupe of singers owed their lives.  \"Marcus,\" said she, \"is said to be a paragon of chastity.  He races in the hippodrome with all the gallants of the town and yet--if it is true it is a miracle--he shuns women as though he were a priest already.  His mother is very anxious that he should become one; but he, by the grace of Aphrodite, is the son of my handsome Appelles, who, if he had gazed into those blue eyes all the way from Rome to Alexandria, would have surrendered at mercy; but then he would also have conquered them--as surely as I hope to live till autumn.  You need not blush so, child. After all, Marcus is a man like other men.  Keep your eyes open, Dame Herse!\"  \"Never fear!\"  cried Herse.  \"And I have need to keep them open I am sorry to say.  The young captain, who on board ship was so bashful and retiring, as soon as he was on land altered his time.  While we were away this morning he crept into his own mother's inn like a ferret, opened the door of our room with the keys of which he has the command--it is shameful!--and proposed to the girl to fly, to leave us--she is the daughter of a dear sister of mine--and go with him; who but he knows where!\"  Damia struck the floor with her crutch and, interrupting the indignant matron with a spiteful laugh, exclaimed:  \"Ha, ha!  The saintly Mary's most saintly son!  Such wonders do not happen every day!  Here, Dada--here; take this ring, it has been worn by a woman who once was young and who has had many lovers.  Close--come close, my sweet child.\"  Dada looked up at the old lady with puzzled eyes; Damia bent her head close to the girl's, and whispered, softly but vehemently in her ear:  \"Only turn that milksop's head, make him so madly and desperately in love with you that he does not know which way to turn for delicious torment. You can do it I know, and if you do--well, I make no promises; but on the day when all Alexandria is talking of that woman's son as wandering out, night after night, to watch under the window of the fair Dada, the heathen singer--when he drives you out in the face of day and in his own chariot, down the Canopic Way and past his mother's door--then child, ask, claim whatever you will, and old Damia will not refuse it.\"  Then raising her head she added to the others:  \"In the afternoon, my friends, you can take possession of your new quarters.  Go with them, Dada.  By-and-bye we will find you a pretty room in the tower.  Come and see me very often, sweet one, and tell me all your prettiest tales.  When I am not too busy I shall always be glad to see you, for you and I have a secret you know.\"  The girl stood up, looking uneasily at the old woman; Damia nodded knowingly, as much as to say that they quite understood each other and again offered her hand to Dada; but Dada could not kiss it; she turned and followed the others more gravely than usual.  Gorgo guessed what the old lady would be at with Dada; as soon as the party of singers had taken leave she went up to her grandmother and said reproachfully:  \"That little fair thing will find no difficulty in making a fool of Marcus; for my part I hardly know him, but why should he pay for his mother's sins against you?  How can he help. . .\"  \"He cannot help it,\" interrupted Damia with decisive abruptness.  \"He can do nothing to save his mother, any more than you can help being a child of twenty and bound to hold your tongue till your opinion is asked.\"                      ...........................  The family of musicians had all met on board the barge which was lying at anchor in the lake, off the ship-yard.  Orpheus had just been an eye- witness of the disturbance which prevailed throughout the city, and the wild howls and cries that were audible in the distance confirmed his report; but the waters of the lake were an unruffled mirror of blue, the slaves in the ship-yard were at work as usual, and the cooing turtle- doves flew from palm to palm.  No signs of troubled times were to be seen in the floating home of the wanderers.  The steward had provided for everything.  There were rooms and beds to spare in the vessel; the large deck-cabin was a comfortable sitting-roo"]]]
