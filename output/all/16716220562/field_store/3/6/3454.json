I was robbed while I was sick, and only for a tambourine queen I got acquainted with, I guess I'd 'a' died. They're treacherous as hell, though.  Long as she thought I had money--oh, well, they's no use expecting kindness in this world.  Or gratitude.  I'm always helpin' folks out and gittin' kicked and cussed for my pay.  Lookit the way I lived with snakes and lizards--lived in a cave, like a coyote!--to help you git this plane in shape.  You was to take me to Los for pay--but I ain't there yet.  I'm stuck here, sick and hungry--I ain't et a mouthful since last night, and then I only had a dish of sour beans that damn' Mex. hussy handed out to me through a window!  Me, Bland Halliday, a flyer that has made his hundreds doing exhibition work; that has had his picture on the front page of big city papers, and folks followin' him down the street just to get a look at him!  Me--why, a yellow dawg has got the edge on me for luck!  I might better be dead--\"  His loose lips quivered.  Tears of self-pity welled up into his pale blue eyes.  He turned away and stared across the barren calf lot that Johnny used for a flying field.  Johnny began to have premonitory qualms of a sympathy which he knew was undeserved.  Bland Halliday had got a square deal--more than a square deal; for Sudden, Johnny knew, had paid him generously for repairing the plane while Johnny was sick.  Bland had undoubtedly squandered the money in one long debauch, and there was no doubt in Johnny's mind of Bland's reason for missing his train.  He was a bum by nature and he would double-cross his own mother, Johnny firmly believed.  Yet, there was Johnny's boyish sympathy that never failed sundry stray dogs and cats that came in his way.  It impelled him now to befriend Bland Halliday.  \"Well, since the cat's come back, I suppose it must have its saucer of milk,\" he grinned, by way of hiding the fact that the lip-quiver had touched him.  \"I haven't taken any nourishment myself for quite some time.  Come on and eat.\"  He started back toward town, and Bland Halliday followed him like a lonesome pup.  On the way, Johnny took stock of Bland in little quick glances from the corner of his eyes.  Bland had been shabby when Johnny discovered him one day on the depot platform of a tiny town farther down the line.  He had been shabbier after three weeks in Johnny's camp, working on the airplane in hope of a free trip to the Coast.  But his shabbiness now surpassed anything Johnny had known, because Bland had evidently made pitiful attempts to hide it.  That, Johnny guessed, was because of the hussy Bland had mentioned.  Bland's shoes were worn through on the sides, and he had blackened his ragged socks to hide the holes.  Somewhere he had got a blue serge coat, from which the lining sagged in frayed wrinkles.  His pockets were torn down at the corners; buttons were gone, grease spots and beer stains patterned the cloth.  Under the coat he wore a pink-and-white silk shirt, much soiled and with the neck frankly open, imitating sport style because of missing buttons.  He looked what he was by nature; what he was by training,--a really skilful birdman,--did not show at all.  He begged a smoke from Johnny and slouched along, with an aimless garrulity talking of his hard luck, now curiously shot with hope. Which irritated Johnny vaguely, since instinct told him whence that hope had sprung.  Still, sympathy made him kind to Bland just because Bland was so worthless and so miserable.  At a dingy, fly-infested place called \"Red's Quick Lunch\" whither Johnny, mindful of his low finances, piloted him, Bland ordered largely and complained because his \"T bone\" was too rare, and afterwards because it was tough.  Johnny dined on \"coffee and sinkers\" so that he could afford Bland's steak and \"French fried\" and hot biscuits and pie and two cups of coffee.  The cat, he told himself grimly, was not content with a saucer of milk.  It was on the top shelf of the pantry, lapping all the cream off the pan!  Afterwards he took Bland to the hotel where his room was paid for until the end of the week, led him up there, produced an old suit of clothes that had not seemed to wear a sufficiently prosperous air for the owner of an airplane, and suggestively opened the door to the bathroom.  Bland took the clothes and went in, mumbling a fear that he would do himself mortal injury if he took a bath right after a meal.  \"If you die, you'll die clean, anyway,\" Johnny told him grimly.  So Bland took a bath and emerged looking almost respectable.  Johnny had brought his second-best shoes out, and Bland put them on, pursing his loose lips because the shoes were a size too small.  But Johnny had thrown Bland's shoes out of the window, so Bland had to bear the pinching.  Johnny sat on the edge of the dresser smoking and fanning the smoke away from his round, meditative eyes while he looked Bland over.  Bland caught the look, and in spite of the shoes he grinned amiably.  \"I take it back, bo, what I said about gratitude.  You got it, after all.\"  \"Huh!\" Johnny grunted.  \"Gratitude, huh?\"  \"I knowed you wouldn't throw down a friend, old top.  I was in the dumps.  A feller'll talk most any way when he's feeling the after effects, and is hungry and broke.  Now I'm my own man again.  What next?  Name it, bo--I'm game.\"  \"Next,\" said Johnny, \"is bed, I guess.  You're clean, now--you can sleep here.\"  Bland showed that he could feel the sentiment called compunction.  \"Much obliged, bo--but I don't want to crowd you--\"  \"You won't crowd me,\" said Johnny drily, \"I aim to sleep with the plane.\"  Bland may have read Johnny's reason for sleeping with his airplane, but beyond one quick look he made no sign.  \"Still nuts over it--I'll say you are,\" he grunted.  \"You wait till you've been in the game long as I have, bo.\"  With a blanket and pillow bought on his way through the town, Johnny disposed himself for the night under the nose of the plane with the wheels of the landing gear at his back.  He was not by nature a suspicious young man, but he knew Bland Halliday; and to know Bland was to distrust him.  He felt that he was taking a necessary precaution, now that he knew Bland was in Tucson.  With the landing gear behind him, no one could move the airplane in the night without first moving him.  Now that he thought of it, Bland had been left fifty miles farther down the line, to catch his train.  Tucson was a perfectly illogical place for him to be in, even for the purpose of carousing.  One would certainly expect him to hurry to the city of his desires and take his pleasure there.  Johnny decided that Bland must still have an eye on the plane.  That he was secretly envious of Bland as an aviator did not add to his mental comfort.  Bland could speak with slighting familiarity of \"the game,\" and assume a boredom not altogether a pose.  Bland had drunk deep and satisfyingly of the cup which Johnny, to save his honor, must put away from him after a tantalising sip or two.  Not until Bland had said, \"Wait till you've been in the game as long as I have,\" had Johnny realized to the full just what it would mean to him to part with his airplane without being accepted by the government as an aviator.  At the Rolling R, when his conscience debt to Sudden pressed so heavily, he had figured very nicely and had found the answer to his problem without much trouble.  To enlist as an aviator with his airplane, or to sell the plane in Tucson, turn the proceeds over to Sudden to pay his debt and enlist as an aviator without the machine, had seemed perfectly simple.  Either way would be making good the mistakes of his past and paving the way for future achievements. Parting with the plane had not promised to so wrench the very heart out of him when he fully expected to fly faster and farther in airplanes owned by the government; faster and farther toward the goal of all red-blooded young males: glory or wealth, the hero's wreath of laurel or the smile of dame Fortune.  Mary V stood on the heights waiting for him, as Johnny had planned and dreamed.  He would come back to her a captain, maybe--perhaps even a major, in these hot times of swift achievement.  They would all be proud to shake his hand, those jeering ones who called him Skyrider for a joke.  Captain Jewel would not have sounded bad at all.  But--  There is no dodging the finality of Uncle Sam's no.  They had not wanted Johnny Jewel to fly for fame and his country's honor.  And if he sold his own airplane, how then would he fly?  How could he ever hope to be in the game as long as Bland had been?  How could he do anything but go back meekly to the Rolling R Ranch and ride bronks for Mary V's father, and be hailed as Skyrider still, who had no more any hope of riding the sky?  Gloom at last plumbed the depths of Johnny's soul, and showed him where grew the root of his unalterable determination to combat Mary V's plan to have him at the ranch.  Much as he loved Mary V he would hate going back to the dull routine of ranch life.  (And after all, a youth like Johnny loves nothing quite so much as his air castles.)  As a rider of bronks he was spoiled, he who had ridden triumphant the high air lanes. He had talked of paying his debt to Sudden, he had talked of his self-respect and his honesty and his pride--but above and beyond them all he was fighting to save his castle in the air.  Debt or no debt, he could never go back to the Rolling R and be a rancher.  Lying there under his airplane and staring up at the starred purple of the night he knew that he could not go back.  Yet he knew too that once he had sold his airplane he would be almost as helpless financially as Bland Halliday, unless he returned to the only trade he knew, the trade of riding bronks and performing the various other duties that would be his portion at the Rolling R.  Johnny pictured himself back at the Rolling R; pictured"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14486"],["title","The Thunder Bird (#3)"],["body","riding out with the boys at dawn after horses, or sweating in the corrals, spitting dust and profanity through long, hot hours.  There was a lure, of course; a picturesque, intangible attraction that calls to the wild blood of youth.  But not as calls this other life which he had tasted. There was no gainsaying the fact--ranch life had grown too tame, too stale for Johnny Jewel.  And there was no gainsaying that other fact--that Mary V would have to reconcile herself to being an aviator's wife, if she would mate with Johnny.  He went to sleep thinking bitterly that neither he nor Mary V need concern themselves at present over that point.  It would be some time before the issue need be faced, judging from Johnny's present prospects.     CHAPTER THREE  JOHNNY WOULD DO STUNTS  Bland woke him, just as day was coming.  A new Bland, fresh shaven,--with Johnny's razor,--and with a certain languid animation in his manner that was in sharp contrast to his extreme dejection of the night before.  \"Thought I'd come out and see if you was going to make a flight this morning,\" he said.  \"It's a good morning for it, bo.  How's she working, these days?  Old man at the ranch wouldn't let me try her out after I'd fixed her up; said you was too sick to have the motor going. So I couldn't be sure I'd made a good job of it.  Give you any trouble?\"  Johnny sat up and knuckled his eyes, his mouth wide open in a capital O.  It seemed to him that Bland had his nerve, and he guessed shrewdly that the aviator was simply making sure of his breakfast.  When cats come back they have a fashion of hanging around the kitchen, he remembered.  Oh, well, there was nothing to be gained by being nasty and even Bland's company was better than none.  \"Hey, ain't yuh awake yet?  I asked yuh how the motor's acting.\"  \"O--o--h, aw-righ!\" yawned Johnny, blinking around for his boots.  \"I ain't been flying much.  Just flew over here from the ranch, and a little circle now and then when something come along that looked like money.  I wanted to keep her in good shape in case the gover'ment--\"  \"Trying to sell it back to the gover'ment, huh?  I coulda told yuh, bo, they wouldn't take it as a gift.  She's a back number now--a has-been, from the gover'ment viewpoint.  Why don't you keep it?  What yuh want to sell it for, f'r cat's sake?  She's a gold mine if you know how to work it, bo--take it from me.\"  \"Well, I wish to thunder you'd show me the gold, then,\" Johnny retorted crossly, pulling on his boots.  \"Lend us a smoke, will yuh, old top?  The money's here, all right, if yuh just know how to get it out.  And flying for the gover'ment ain't the way.  I'll say a man's got to be his own boss if he wants to pull down real money.  Long as you're workin' for somebody else, he's getting the velvet.  You ain't, believe me.  And the gover'ment as a boss--\"  \"Well, good golly, come to the point!\" snapped Johnny.  \"How can I make money with this plane?\"  He gave it a disgruntled look, and turned to Bland.  \"She's a bird of a millionaire's toy, if you ask me,\" he said. \"She's a fiend for gas and oil, and every time you turn 'er around there's some darned thing to be fixed or replaced.  I'm about broke, trying to keep her up till I can sell out.  It's coffee and sinkers for you, old timer, if you're going to eat on me.  Another meal like you had last night, and we'll both have to skip a few in order to buy gas to joy-ride some cheap sport that lets on he's thinking of buying.  I suppose your idea is--\"  \"F'r cat's sake give me a chance to tell yuh!  Course you'll go broke trying to support the plane.  You're goin' at it backwards.  Make the plane support you.  That's my idea.  And you do it by exhibition flying for money--not sailin' around giving the whole damn country a free treat.  \"I know--you think I'm a bum and all that; maybe you think I'm a crook, fer all I know.  And you turn up your nose at anything I say.  But lemme tell yuh, old top, I ain't a D. and O. because I never made any money flyin'.  It's because I blowed what I made.  And it's because I made so damn' much it went to my head and made a fool outa me.  Listen here, bo: I bought me a Stutz outa what I earned flyin' in one season--and I blowed money right and left and smashed the car and like to of broke my neck, and had to pay damages to the other feller that peeled my roll down to the size of a pencil.  The point is, it took _money_ to do them things, didn't it?  And I made it flyin' my own plane.  That's what you want to soak into your system.  _I made big money flying_.  What I done with the money don't need to worry you--you ain't copyin' me for morals.  \"Now what you want to do is learn some stunts, first off.  You learn to loop and tail-slide and the fallin' leaf, and to write your name, and them things.  It ain't so hard--not for a guy like you that ain't got sense enough to be afraid of nothing.  The way you went off in that plane with the girl made my hair stand on end, and that's no kiddin', neither.  If you'd had a fear germ in your system you wouldn't 'a' done that.  But you done it, and got away with it, is the point.  And you been gittin' away with it right along--and you not knowin' your motor any more'n I know ridin' on a horse!\"  \"Aw, say!  That's goin' too far,\" protested Johnny, but Bland gave him no heed.  \"You learn the stunts--early in the morning when there ain't the hull town out to rubber--and then pull off an exhibition or two. Seventy-five dollars is the least you ever need to expect.  Don't go in the air for less.  From that up--depends on how spectacular you are. The public loves to watch for the death fall.  That's what they pay to see--not hopin' you get killed, but not wantin' to miss seeing it in case yuh do.  And with this the only airplane around here--why, say, bo, it's a cinch!\"  Johnny fanned the smoke away from his face and eyed Bland with lofty tolerance.  \"And where do you expect to come in?  You needn't kid yourself into hoping I'll take you for a self-forgetful martyr person. What's the little joker, Bland?\"  Bland turned his pale, opaque stare upon Johnny for a minute.  \"Aw, for cat's sake, gimme the doubt, bo!  I'm human in more ways than tryin' to see how much booze I kin lap up.  It's a chance I want to start fresh. This bumming around ain't getting me anything.  I'm sick of it.  You gotta be learnt to do exhibition stuff, and I'm the guy that can learn yuh.  You'll want a mechanician to keep your motor in shape.  I can _make_ a motor, gimme the tools.  You want somebody that knows the game to kinda manage things.  You're Skyrider Johnny, same as the boys at the ranch calls yuh.  Yon gotta have a flunkey, ain't yuh?  I'm willin' to be it.  I'll change my name, so nobody needs to know it's Bland Halliday.  Or you can gimme a share in the net profits, and I'll keep the name and make it pull things our way.  They's no use talking, bo, I've got the goods!  The name Bland Halliday is a trademark for flyin'--and never mind if it also stands for damfool.  I'll brace up and give yuh the best I got.  Honest, that's what I want--a chance to get on my feet agin.  I'd ruther help you fly your plane than fly one of my own.  I'd run amuck agin if I owned anything I could raise money on.  \"If you think I tried to do you dirt, back there in the desert, bo, you're wrong.  Ab-so-lutely.  I thought you was fixing to double-cross me, and git away with the plane and leave me there.  It got my goat--I'll say it did--that desert stuff.  So I hid the gas, so you couldn't go off and leave me.  But that's behind us.  You can give me a chance now to straighten up, and I can put you in the way to make big money.  You think it over, bo.  They's no great hurry, and we can make a flight now and see how she stacks up.  Be a sport--go fill up the tank and let's go.\"  Johnny ground the cigarette stub under his heel in the dirt, shrugged his shoulders with a fine imitation of perfect indifference, and yawned.  He would think over Bland's idea.  He did not, of course, intend to fall for anything that did not look like good business, and he was not at all anxious to have Bland for a partner.  Indeed, having Bland for a partner was about the last thing Johnny would ever expect himself to do.  Still, there was no harm in letting Bland down easy.  A flight or two, maybe, would give Johnny some good pointers.  He had learned much from Bland, in a very short time, he admitted readily to himself.  He could learn more, and he could let Bland go over the motor.  By that time he would maybe have a buyer.  If not, he would have time to decide about exhibition flying.  Johnny did not know that as he went after gas his step was springier than it had been for a long, long while.  He did not know why it was that he whistled while he filled the torpedo-shaped tank--indeed, Johnny did not even know that he whistled, nor that it was the first time since he had worked over his plane down at Sinkhole Camp when all his dreams were bright, and bad luck had not knocked at his door.  Yet he did whistle while he made ready for flight, and his eyes were big and round and eager, said he moved with the impatient energy of a youth going to his favorite game.  These signs Mary V would have recognized immediately; Johnny did not know the signs existed.  Bland helped himself to a pair of new coveralls of Johnny's and tinkered with the motor.  Johnny went around the plane, testing cables and trying to conceal even from himself his new hope of keeping it.  \"All right, bo,\" Bland announced at last.  \"Kick the block away and let's run her out.  She sounds pretty fair--better than I expected.\"  It pleased Johnny that Bland seemed to take it as a matter of course that he should occupy the front seat.  The last time they had flown together, Bland had occupied it perforce, with Johnny and two guns behind him.  After all, Johnny reflected, he would not have been so suspicious of Bland if Mary V had not influenced him.  And"]]]
