Presently they were out of sight of the shore and the Cricket turned upon his heel and hopped away.                       CRICKETS          The Cricket is the kind of chap         For whom I never cared a rap!         I always thought he hopped about         The fields, because he had the gout         And lost his crutches in the crops,         And that's the reason why he hops.         But now I'll have to change my mind         Because I see he's very kind,         For he who is a friend in need         Is quite the best of friends indeed.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER V   And Kernel Cob and Sweetclover sailed and sailed for many days and nights.  \"I wonder where we are and if we shall ever be on land again,\" sighed poor little Sweetclover.  \"Of course we will,\" answered Kernel Cob although he, too, was doubtful, but being a soldier he had to keep his courage up and to cheer Sweetclover. So he pretended that they were perfectly safe.  And on they sailed and you couldn't see anything but water for miles and miles, no matter where you looked.  \"What's that?\" said Sweetclover, and she was so excited that she nearly tipped over the boat.  \"I can't see anything but water and a little too much of that to suit me,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"Don't you see something dark against the sky?\" she asked.  \"No, I don't,\" said Kernel Cob, and he shaded his eyes with his hand the way sailors do when they look for something at sea.  \"I hope it isn't a whale,\" said Sweetclover.  \"It had better not be,\" said Kernel Cob, \"if he knows what's good for him,\" and he patted his sword in a very brave manner.  \"It's getting bigger and bigger,\" said Sweetclover. \"Don't you see it?\"  \"Sure!\" said Kernel Cob, \"I saw it all the time, it's a ship.\" And like all people who tell fibs he was found out, for it wasn't a ship at all.  \"It's land!\" said Sweetclover, joyfully, and sure enough it was, for soon you could see the trees. And as they sailed closer the trees grew taller and taller, and after a while you could see the shore.  \"It's a little island,\" said Sweetclover.  \"What's an island?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Didn't you ever go to school?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"No, but I wish I had.\"  But Kernel Cob didn't answer. He just steered the shoeboat toward the shore by putting one leg over the side as if it were a rudder, and in a little while they ran the boat up on the shore and Sweetclover hopped out and Kernel Cob pulled the boat up on the beach so the tide, when it came in, wouldn't take it out to sea again.  And they walked along the beach.  \"I'm very hungry,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Sit down here,\" said Kernel Cob, \"and I'll see if I can find something for dinner.\" And he went along the beach.  After he had walked a long distance, he found a tree with some nuts on it, and he picked a lot of them and put them in his hat and started back to Sweetclover.  You may imagine his astonishment when he reached the spot where he had left her and discovered that she was not there.  But, all about on the sand, he saw foot-prints as of a great number of bare footed people.  \"The savages have taken her,\" he muttered, and drawing his sword he ran off in the direction they had taken.  Through the woods he ran, and pretty soon he came to a clearing and there was Sweetclover surrounded by about a thousand savages shouting and dancing and waving spears above their heads. And Kernel Cob grasped his sword firmly in his hand and ran at them, and, so fiercely did he fight, that in a minute he had driven away about a hundred of them. And he would have driven them all away, but his foot slipped and, before he could get up again, he was overpowered and bound hand and foot.  And they brought him before their chief who was a great giant.  And when it was night, the savages tied the two captives to trees and went to sleep about a great fire. And in the middle of the night when Kernel Cob was thinking of some way in which to make their escape, he heard something stirring in the grass at his feet.  \"Who's that?\" he whispered.  \"Tommy Hare,\" was the reply, and he ran out from a stone behind which he had been hiding.  \"Good for you!\" said Kernel Cob. \"Come stand up on your hind legs, like a good fellow, and untie me from this tree.\"  \"Who are you?\" asked Tommy cautiously.  \"I'm Kernel Cob and this is my little friend Sweetclover and we're looking for Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather and we've been captured by the savages who may keep us here forever if you don't help us.\"  \"That I will,\" said Tommy, and in a jiffy he had gnawed them free.  \"Now, show us the way down to the beach as quickly as you can,\" said Kernel Cob, \"for it will be daylight soon and then it will be too late. Come.\"  And they started running as fast as they could.  And not a minute too soon, for they had got only half way when they heard the shouts of the savages and knew that their escape had been discovered.  Faster and faster they ran, but the savages gained on them at every step and were soon close upon their heels.  [Illustration]  \"Jump on my back!\" shouted Tommy, \"for I can run faster than all of them put together.\"  And they did so and flew over the ground as fast as the wind.  And they reached the shore and jumped into the shoeboat and Tommy shoved them off with a great push that put them out of sight of land, and the savages' spears fell in the water behind them.  \"That was a narrow escape,\" said Sweetclover, as she settled down in the boat. \"I hope Tommy Hare wasn't caught by the savages.\"  But she needn't have worried in the least about Tommy, for as soon as he had pushed them off, he scurried away and was at that moment sitting under a tree, eating his breakfast.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER VI   Kernel Cob and Sweetclover sailed all day. The shoeboat rode the waves with perfect ease. Up it went and up till it came to the top of a great wave, and then it would race down on the other side as if they were bob-sledding and great sport it was, too, out in the middle of the ocean, and Sweetclover laughed and even old serious Kernel Cob smiled and forgot all about fighting.  Toward the afternoon, the sea quieted down and they rode along faster and presently, Sweetclover, who was always watching, cried out:  \"I see another island!\"  \"So it is!\" said Kernel Cob, looking in the wrong direction.  \"Not over there. Look!\" and she pointed.  Sure enough. There was a large black stretch of what appeared to be land. And it was very flat.  \"I hope there will be no more savages to fight,\" said Sweetclover.  \"I hope there will,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"It's moving,\" said Sweetclover. \"It seems to be coming this way.\"  \"Where did it go?\" asked Kernel Cob, for at that moment it disappeared altogether.  \"I'm sure I saw it,\" said Sweetclover. \"Didn't you?\"  But Kernel Cob only frowned and looked serious.  And, in a few minutes, they saw it again, but this time it was very much nearer and bigger and the sun made it look very smooth.  \"It's a whale!\" said Sweetclover.  \"Who cares,\" said he, and drew his sword.  And the turtle, for it was a turtle and not a whale at all, came towards them and it was very large, nearly as big around as an acre. And when it got very near to the boat, its head came up out of its shell and the little shoe boat shook with the waves it made.  And the turtle was just about to snap the boat in its mouth when Kernel Cob swung his sword and with one mighty stroke cut off its head.  \"Ha, ha!\" cried Kernel Cob, but, receiving no reply from Sweetclover, he looked about and found she had fainted.  He found also that the boat was leaking badly from a crack in the side made, no doubt, by the turtle.  Quickly, he lifted Sweetclover and carried her aboard the back of the turtle and laid her gently down, for the shoe was sinking and he was no sooner out of it than it turned over on its side.  \"Not a minute too soon,\" muttered Kernel Cob, \"and now to revive Sweetclover.\" This he soon did and she opened her eyes and looked about in wonder.  \"Where are we?\" she asked.  \"On the old turtle's back,\" laughed Kernel Cob.  \"But we shall never get anywhere now, for we have no sail,\" said Sweetclover. And she began to cry.  \"Crying never did anybody any good,\" said Kernel Cob, \"I wish you would stop.\"  \"I can't help it,\" said Sweetclover, \"I'm miserable.\"  \"What's all this about?\" said a strange voice, and looking about quickly, they saw a sea-horse riding up to them.  \"I am very glad to see you,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"You're just in time to give us a lift on our journey.\"  \"With pleasure,\" whinnied the sea-horse. \"And where might you be going?\"  \"To find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Well, leap on my back,\" said the Horse, \"and I'll see that you get there if it's in the water.\"  So Kernel Cob got astride the horse and helped Sweetclover to mount behind him.  \"Where are we?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Cuba is right over there,\" said the sea-horse pointing with his ear.  \"Well, let's see if they are there, if you please,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Aye, aye, Miss,\" he said, and trotted away as nearly like a real horse as he could.  They had gone along for a couple of hours without mishap when a storm came up. At first the sea-horse paid no attention to the storm, but one great big clap of thunder rang out and a flash of lightning struck so close it startled him.  With a great leap, he started forward, his eyes bulging from his head, and, with a stream of foam flung out from his mouth, he turned and raced through the water at a terrific rate, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover clinging to him with all their strength.  \"He's a runaway,\" shouted Kernel Cob and, sure enough, the horse was mad and nothing could stop him. On and on they raced, but everything must come to an end and along about the afternoon, they saw land in the distance."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14110"],["title","Kernel Cob And Little Miss Sweetclover (#3)"],["body","this he made at breakneck speed and with a final spurt dashed into an inlet where many ships rode at anchor and a large city rose against the sky.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Kernel Cob.  In and out among the ships the sea-horse ran, until, with a last gasp, he flung himself forward and fell upon the surface of the water.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER VII   When the sea-horse fell, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover were thrown over his head and landed into the water, but Kernel Cob told Sweetclover they would soon be picked up.  And so they were, for a row-boat pulled toward them and in a minute they were taken from the water and laid on the bottom of the boat.  \"What did I tell you?\" said Kernel Cob. \"If you wish for anything strong enough you'll get it.\"  \"You'll wish you were never born before you get out of here,\" said a deep, strange voice, and looking about, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover were surprised to see two puppets, their own size.  The one who spoke was a villainous-looking fellow dressed as a Pirate. His face was browned as if by the sun, earrings were in his ears, a black hat on his head, and a deep and very ugly scowl was painted on his forehead.  The other was good looking and resembled the hero in a story. He had pink cheeks and a pretty smile.  Now, when Sweetclover heard the villainous puppet speak, she moved away from him but Kernel Cob, who always welcomed a new adventure and saw in this fellow a possible enemy, spoke up:  \"Who and what are you?\"  \"A friend,\" answered the Villain.  \"You don't look it,\" said Sweetclover, \"you look more like a villain.\"  \"And so I am,\" said he. \"At least that's what I'm painted to be, but I have a kind heart just the same.\"  \"What are you doing out here in this boat?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"The man who is rowing and who picked you up is a puppet showman,\" he explained.  \"I don't like him a bit,\" said Sweetclover.  \"You'll like him less and less as you get to know him,\" said the Villain. \"He's very brutal. That's why we are in the boat, for yesterday during the puppet show, he broke the Hero in a rage and he had to go across the harbor to a toy-shop to buy another. That's the new Hero alongside of me.\"  \"He's very handsome,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Sure,\" said the Villain. \"He's got to be. Heroes are all handsome.\"  \"But why are you so ugly?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Ha, ha,\" laughed the Villain, \"why bless your heart, I'm not a real villain, I only play the part of a villain in the play. My real self is something very different. But what, may I ask, are you doing out here in the harbor of Valparaiso?\"  \"Is that where we are?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"Sure,\" said Kernel Cob, for he didn't want the Villain to think he wasn't smart. \"Didn't you know we were in Italy?\"  \"Ha, ha,\" sneered the Hero, and from that moment Kernel Cob disliked him.  \"But you haven't told me how you got into the water,\" persisted the Villain.  \"We came on a sea-horse from Cuba,\" said Sweetclover.  \"That must have been an exciting adventure,\" said the Villain. \"Tell me all of it.\"  And Kernel Cob told him how they had been to the Moon on a parasol and all that. When he had finished, he asked the Villain to tell them some of his adventures.  But the Villain was a modest sort of fellow and would say nothing but that he was very unhappy, leading a wicked life. What annoyed him most, he said, was that nearly everybody thought he was bad.  \"It only goes to show,\" he said, \"that you can never go by anybody's looks.\"  \"You're right,\" said Kernel Cob, and gave a sharp glance at the Hero. \"Many a kind heart beats beneath an ugly face.\"  And then the row-boat landed at the dock, and the showman, taking the Villain and the Hero under one arm and Kernel Cob and Sweetclover under the other, got out and walked away.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER VIII   Through the town they went and everywhere children ran after them, and wondered at the strange puppets. And after a while they came to a little theatre and were thrown down among a lot of other puppets.  \"I don't intend to stay here,\" said Kernel Cob. \"I'm going to run away. I've got to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather.\"  \"I don't think you'll be able to get away,\" said the Villain.  \"Well, at least I'll try,\" answered Kernel Cob. \"Wouldn't you like to come with us?\"  \"You bet,\" said the Villain, for he had taken a great fancy to Kernel Cob and especially to Sweetclover, whose gentle manners appealed very strongly to him. \"But how are you going to do it?\"  \"Let me think,\" said Kernel Cob and they were very quiet for a long while.  \"I tell you what,\" said the Villain, \"When I am going to play I'll run off the stage and as soon as you see the Showman run after me, you must be ready to run and before he catches me, you'll be safe away.\"  \"But you won't be able to come with us, then,\" said Sweetclover, \"and you'll be beaten.\"  \"Well, as long as you and Kernel Cob get away, it won't matter what happens to me,\" said the Villain.  \"That's very noble of you, I'm sure,\" said Kernel Cob, \"and I see that you are a very friendly Villain, but I think I can find a better plan than that.\"  While they were talking, the Showman came and tied some strings on Kernel Cob and Sweetclover.  \"What's that for?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"I guess you are going to play in the show,\" explained the Villain. \"That's the way he works us.\"  \"Now we will never be able to get away,\" sighed Sweetclover.  \"Won't we though,\" said Kernel Cob, \"leave it to me,\" for he was very brave of heart and nothing daunted him, because he was a soldier, you see, and was brave by nature.  And the Showman took them into the theatre, and the performance began. When the play was over, quick as a flash, Kernel Cob cut the strings from Sweetclover and himself.  \"Now is our time!\" shouted he to Sweetclover and the Villain, who were standing close by, and the Villain, catching Sweetclover by the hand, ran away with her.  Holding the Showman at a distance, Kernel Cob backed his way off the stage, joined the Villain and Sweetclover and all three ran out into the street at the top of their speed, but the Showman was much faster and was close on their heels when they came to a corner.  \"Straight ahead!\" shouted Kernel Cob while he turned and ran up the other street. This puzzled the Showman just what Kernel Cob wanted, and while he stood, wondering which one of them to follow, they gained on him.  Feeling angrier with Kernel Cob than with the Villain and Sweetclover, he made after him, but Kernel Cob had a good start this time and had turned another corner, and seeing an open doorway, leaped in and was well-hidden by the time the Showman came puffing by.  For a long time the Showman searched, but never thought of the door behind which Kernel Cob was hiding and finally gave up the search and went back.  After Kernel Cob had given him plenty of time to get away, he came out cautiously and with great courage went back the way he had come, anxious to find Sweetclover and the Villain.  When he came to the corner where Sweetclover and the Villain had gone straight ahead, he followed on after them, but could find no trace of them. Night was coming on and still he walked and being very tired with all his running, he sat down on the roadside, for he was now out in the country. And the moon came out and he watched it and thought of the many adventures he had been in since Sweetclover and he were up there and a great longing came into his heart to see her and if he had not been a soldier, I am sure he would have cried, but he didn't. Instead, he got upon his feet and looked about for some place where he could spend the night.  This he soon found, for close at hand was a field in which some hay had been stacked, and, careful not to arouse the dog, he crept under one of the haystacks and soon was fast asleep.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER IX   The Villain and Sweetclover ran on and on till their legs would carry them no farther and, being entirely out of breath, they came to a halt at last. They were far out beyond the City, and, if they had not been worried about Kernel Cob, they would have enjoyed the lovely fields of flowers and sunshine, but Sweetclover was quite sure that the wicked Showman had captured Kernel Cob and, having recovered her breath, sat down and began to cry. And the Villain, being a very kind-hearted puppet sat down to comfort her, but, try as he would, Sweetclover only cried the louder.  \"I'm sure he's captured, I'm sure he's captured,\" she repeated over and over again, until she made the Villain believe it and he began to cry, too.  \"Here, this will never do,\" said the Villain, getting up. \"I'll go back and see if I can find him.\"  \"No, no!\" cried Sweetclover. \"You'll be caught too, and then what will I do?\" So he stayed with her.  Presently they were aroused by the barking of a dog and, looking about, discovered that they were sitting on the terrace of a big house all about which were fields of flowers and grain. And the dog, a big mastiff, came toward them. Sweetclover put out a friendly hand and said, \"Nice Fido.\"  \"Don't call me Fido,\" said the dog, \"my name is Napoleon.\"  \"Oh, excuse me,\" said Sweetclover, \"I didn't know.\"  \"That's all right,\" said Napoleon with a stately bow. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" said Sweetclover. \"My friend here,\" and she turned to the Villain, \"and I have been separated from Kernel Cob and we are anxious to find him. You didn't see him pass by, did you?\"  \"No,\" said Napoleon, \"that I didn't.\"  \"Oh dear,\" sighed Sweetclover, \"night is coming on and we have nowhere to go.\"  \"If you will give me a few minutes,\" said Napoleon, with a courteous wave of his paw in the direction of his house, \"I will put my humble home at your disposal.\"  \"We cannot think of disturbing you,\" said Sweetclover.  \"It will be no trouble whatever,\" he said. \"If I can be of any service to you, it will give me much pleasure.\"  And so they followed him, as he walked away with"]]]
