The click-click from under the engine hatches became hurried and louder. Joe wrinkled his forehead anxiously. The _Adventurer_ stopped going astern of the other boat and for a little distance they hung bow to bow. They saw Harry Corwin, at the wheel of the _Follow Me_, lower his head to speak to his brother in the engine room. The _Follow Me_ began to forge ahead again, slowly but certainly.  \"Give her more gas, Steve,\" begged Perry. \"We can't have a little old 'puffing pig' of a boat like that walking away from us. Look at those idiots grin!\"  \"And watch them change their faces,\" laughed Steve as he drew the throttle forward another two or three notches. Under the hatches the engine uttered a new note and a quick jarring became felt. Joe's anxiety increased to uneasiness.  \"Say, Steve, do you think--is it all right--I mean--\"  \"She's only doing about seventeen,\" replied Steve calmly. \"The throttle isn't nearly open yet. But I guess that's enough,\" he added as he glanced across the water. Perry, leaning across the gunwale, beckoned insultingly.  \"Come on!\" he called. \"What are you stopping there for?\"  The _Follow Me_ replied to the taunt, but what the reply was they didn't know on the _Adventurer_, for the latter was ahead now by its full length and gaining perceptibly every moment. Tom Corwin's head appeared over the cabin roof, he took a look at the rival craft and popped from sight again. The _Follow Me_ stopped going back and hung with her nose abreast the _Adventurer's_ stern. Phil, who had been writing a letter in the cabin, emerged and joined the group outside.  \"How fast is she going, Steve?\" he asked.  \"About seventeen, I think. Still, Harry said the _Follow Me's_ best was eighteen, and she isn't losing any, and so we may be doing eighteen, too. Guess we might as well settle the matter right now, though.\"  With which he pulled the throttle to the limit, and the white cruiser, quivering from stem to stern, forged ahead. \"We're doing a good twenty miles an hour now,\" shouted Steve above the hum of the motor, \"and she won't go any faster unless we get out and push!\"  But twenty miles was fast enough to distance the _Follow Me_, although that boat held on gamely all the way across the bay and only slowed down when, a good quarter of a mile behind the _Adventurer_, she was abreast Pelican Bar. The _Adventurer_ dropped her gait to twelve and presently the black cruiser, having negotiated the inlet in the wake of the other craft, drew within hailing distance and Harry Corwin called across through the megaphone.  \"Some boat, Steve!\" he shouted. \"We're satisfied!\"  Steve waved back and the two cruisers settled down to their forty-mile run along the shore, the _Follow Me_ gliding smoothly along abaft the _Adventurer's_ starboard beam. They sighted few other craft this morning, and, as there was a deal of sameness in the coast, the fellows settled down to various occupations. Steve conducted a second class in navigation, with Perry and Han as pupils, and Perry was allowed to take the wheel all the way from Smith's Point to a position off the Moriches Life-Saving Station. Phil went on with his letters, Ossie performed mysterious rites in the galley, with Han looking on interestedly from atop the dish-board, and Neil, exhausted by his labours as crew, reclined on the seat in the cockpit and stared sleepily at a blue and unclouded sky. Joe hunched himself on a seat on the bridge deck and studied his book on motor boating, becoming, if truth were told, more and more mystified as to the working of that remarkable affair that was click-clicking away under his feet.  The _Adventurer_ reached the inlet to Shinnecock Bay a few minutes past ten and, closely followed by her companion boat, put through and turned her nose past Ponquogue Point. As Comorant Point drew near the shores of the bay closed in and the cruiser turned to port and, signalling her way past various craft, finally came to a pause outside the canal entrance. When the _Follow Me_ floated alongside Wink Wheeler called across.  \"What do you say to going ashore, fellows?\" he asked. \"It looks like a jolly sort of place. We've got plenty of time, haven't we?\"  \"All the time in the world and nothing to do,\" replied Steve cheerfully. \"We'll make that landing over there and you can come alongside us, Harry.\"  Ten minutes later they were stretching their legs ashore. Canoe Place held plenty to interest them. The view was magnificent, for on one side of them lay Shinnecock Bay, across whose still, pond-like waters they had just sailed, and on the other stretched the blue expanse of Great Peconic Bay, sun-bathed, aglint with rippling waves and dotted with white sails. A small boy with one suspender performing the duty of two and a straw hat minus about everything except the brim offered to guide them and his proposition was quickly accepted and a bright new quarter changed hands. The quaint old Inn was visited and their informant gravely pointed to two sentinel willow trees and told them that \"them trees was planted by Napoleon a couple o' hunerd years ago. He got 'em some place called Saint Helen. They had him in prison there for somethin'.\" The boys viewed the willows doubtfully, but, as Phil said, it was more fun to believe the extraordinary tale and they tried hard to do so. Steve attempted to secure more historical information from the small boy, but the latter appeared to have exhausted his fund. After that they viewed several Summer estates from respectful distances and, finding that their guide had nothing further of real interest for them, went back to the landing and re-embarked.  A quarter-mile or so of artificial canal took them through the narrow neck of land between the two bays and let them out in a cove beyond whose mouth the waters of Great Peconic stretched, apparently illimitable. The course was set northeast by east and they began the trip to Shelter Island. About half an hour later Joe discovered that the _Follow Me_ was far behind and it was soon evident that she had stopped. After a moment Steve decided to turn back and see what was wrong, and when the _Adventurer_ rounded the smaller boat's stern they learned that the _Follow Me_ was having engine trouble. For a few minutes the _Adventurer_ hovered by, and then, as there was a fair breeze blowing now and Joe and Neil were showing interest in the sea-sickness remedy, Steve suggested a tow and Harry Corwin, after some hesitation, pocketed his pride and agreed. A little before one o'clock the two boats slipped into North Sea Harbour and dropped anchors. While the _Follow Me_ doctored her engine the _Adventurer_ sat down to a delayed dinner. Ossie gloomily predicted that everything would be spoiled, but if it was, no one save Ossie apparently knew it. There was broiled bluefish and boiled potatoes and spinach and sliced cucumbers that day, followed by a marvellous concoction which the steward called a prune pudding. Perry said he didn't care what it was called so long as it came, and, please he'd like some more! No cook can withstand such a compliment as that, and Ossie cast off his gloom. They all declared that that dinner was just about the best they had ever eaten, and they meant it, and Ossie swelled visibly with pride and almost declined Han's half-hearted offer to help wash dishes!  When the rest went back to the deck and saw the fellows on the _Follow Me_ eating sandwiches and other items of a cold repast on deck they felt rather apologetic, and Joe and Steve slung the tender over and paddled across to lend what assistance they might. But they found Tom Corwin, very dirty and hot and somewhat peevish, reassembling the engine with the help of \"Brownie,\" and learned that the trouble had been discovered and that the boat would go just as soon as they could get her together again, which, from present indications, would be some time the day after tomorrow! Harry Corwin told Steve he had better go ahead, that there was no use in the _Adventurer_ lying around and waiting, but Steve replied that there was no hurry and that they'd stand by. The atmosphere on the _Follow Me_ was not very cheerful and the visitors went back to their own craft after a decent lapse of time. About three the fellows donned swimming tights and went in from the boat and had a fine time in the water, and by the time they had had enough of that there came a heartening _chug-chug-chug_ from the _Follow Me's_ exhaust and Wink announced that they were ready to go on.  As a result of the delay, it was almost six when they reached Shelter Island and steered the cruiser to an anchorage. They had supper ashore at seven, having dressed themselves in shore-going attire, but it was noticeable that it was the _Follow Me's_ company who made the most of the meal. Neil met up with an acquaintance on the hotel porch after supper--they chose to call it supper although it was really a full-course dinner--and that meeting led to introductions and the boys \"did the society act,\" to use Perry's disgusted phrase, for the rest of the evening. As it was a Saturday night there was a dance going on, and Steve and Joe and Han, of the _Adventurer's_ crowd, and several of the other boat's company, took part. They didn't get back to the boats until almost midnight, and Perry fell asleep in the dingey, on the second trip, and had to be practically hoisted aboard. He muttered protestingly until he had been dumped in his berth and then promptly went to sleep as he was.  They spent the next day at Shelter Island, not because anyone considered it wrong to cruise on Sunday, but because Steve and Joe and Han had discovered attractions at the hotel. Perry demanded that the question of staying be put to a vote and the rest agreed, but the result wasn't what Perry had hoped for because Neil basely cast his ballot with Steve and Joe and Han. The four went off soon after breakfast, having spent much time "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13897"],["title","The Adventure Club Afloat (#8)"],["body","effort on their various attires, and weren't seen again until late afternoon. At least, they weren't seen again aboard the cruiser until that time, although Perry, Phil and Ossie, following them ashore after dinner, were scandalised to see them strolling around quite brazenly in the company of an equal number of young ladies.  \"Girls!\" snorted Perry scornfully. \"Why, the big chumps, they look as if they liked it! Gee, it's enough to sicken a fellow!\"     CHAPTER VI  IN THE FOG   \"We've been going two whole days now,\" declared Perry, \"and we haven't even glimpsed an adventure.\" It was Tuesday morning and the two cruisers were lying side by side in New Bedford harbour. A light drizzle was falling and even under the awning of the bridge deck everything was coated with a film of moisture. The _Adventurer_ and the _Follow Me_ had done just short of a hundred miles yesterday, reaching the present port at nightfall. They had averaged fifteen miles an hour and neither engine had missed an explosion all day long. Joe had been rather stuck-up over the way his engine had performed and had been inclined to take a good share of the credit to himself. Perry, however, had declared that the only reason the thing had run was because Joe had left it alone.  \"It's lucky for us you're afraid to touch it,\" said Perry. \"If you weren't we'd have been wallowing around somewhere between here and Africa two days ago!\"  It had been too late to go ashore for sight-seeing last evening, and they had put it off until morning. And now it was drizzling in a steady, whole-hearted way that promised to make sight-seeing a miserable business. Some of the crew of the _Follow Me_ had come aboard to discuss plans and the question was whether to remain in harbour and await better weather or to set out again and run as far as Martha's Vineyard. Perry was all for action, and he had the support of numerous others, but Steve pointed out that running the cruiser in such weather in strange waters was not over pleasant. \"It's all well enough for the rest of you, for all you have to do is lie around and read, but it's another thing to stand up there at the wheel and keep from running into the landscape!\"  \"Give her to me,\" advised Perry. \"I'll get her to Edgartown or wherever you want to go, right-side-up with care.\"  \"If you take the wheel,\" said Han, \"I get out and walk every foot of the way.\"  \"Better put your rubbers on,\" suggested Wink Wheeler.  \"You fellows make me very tired,\" continued Perry severely. \"You call yourselves the Adventure Club and start out to see some sport, and then the first time there's a heavy mist you want to stick around an old harbour for fear you'll get damp! We've been going two whole days now, and we haven't even glimpsed an adventure!\"  \"An adventure is one thing,\" said Ossie, \"and getting drowned is something else again. Tell you what, Perry; if you are so keen for sport why don't you slip into the tender and run over to Vineyard Haven yourself? We'll follow along tomorrow, or maybe this afternoon.\"  \"I want to see this town,\" said Joe. \"There's lots to look at in here. Whaling ships and a museum and--and lots of romantic things.\"  \"The whaling ships are all gone now,\" said Perry disdainfully. \"They've chopped them all up and sold them by the cord for fire wood. I know, for we bought a lot of it once. It cost dad about ten dollars for express and didn't burn any different from any other wood. My grandmother--\"  Steve groaned. \"For the love of lemons, Perry, don't resurrect your grandmother. Let the poor old lady lie.\"  \"She isn't dead,\" denied Perry indignantly. \"She's ninety-one and a heap smarter than you are.\"  \"Perry,\" charged Joe severely, \"I distinctly remember you telling us that your grandmother died of sea-sickness.\"  \"I didn't. I told you she ate lemons and--\"  \"Died of acid stomach? Oh, all right. I knew she was dead.\"  \"Oh, dry up! She ate lemons to keep from being sea-sick, you idiot. And if you ate them you wouldn't have to lug around a lot of silly medicine that doesn't amount to a row of pins. And if--\"  \"All very interesting,\" interrupted Phil mildly, \"but it isn't deciding whether we're to stay here or go on. Personally, I think that that should be up to the captain. If he isn't to decide whether the weather is right or wrong, who is?\"  \"That's so,\" agreed several. \"Steve's the captain. What you say goes, Steve.\"  \"Very well. Then we'll stay here until it stops misting, or, at any rate, until tomorrow. If it's still nasty then and you fellows want to go on, I'll go. Now let's go ashore and see what's doing.\"  \"O Harry!\" called Wink. \"We're going to stay until tomorrow. Come ashore.\"  In spite of the drizzle they found a good deal to interest them in New Bedford, and Joe actually did find a whaler, although it was no longer in commission. At noon, Ossie, having made many purchases in the town, served a dinner that made the world look a lot brighter. Afterwards the crews of the two boats exchanged calls, read, dozed, played the graphophone and didn't much care whether it drizzled or not. Toward the end of the day the sun peered forth experimentally and there followed another expedition ashore. But the sun soon gave up its attempt to do any business that day and the drizzle set in harder than ever. In the evening the entire club attended a moving picture show and thus disposed of several hours that might otherwise have proved difficult to get through. A motor-boat, no matter how large or luxurious, is not the most interesting place to live on in wet weather.  The next morning the mist had ceased, but the sun was hidden behind dark clouds and the world was still rather dreary. But plenty of hot coffee, some of Ossie's baking powder biscuits and the almost invariable fried bacon cheered them remarkably, and at a little past eight the order was given to weigh anchor and the two cruisers, the _Adventurer_ showing the way, set forth across Buzzard's Bay for Edgartown.  It was a sixteen-mile run to the channel between Nonamesset Island and the mainland, and Steve followed the steamboat course closely. The chart showed many rocks and ledges in the first six miles, but neither of the cruisers drew enough to make it necessary for their skippers to worry. There was rough water, however, and Joe was seen to look anxiously toward the after cabin. A flukey breeze came out of the southeast and made sweaters comfortable. The shore of Naushon Island was grey and indistinct when the _Adventurer_ straightened out for the run across the bay. Behind her the _Follow Me_ plunged gallantly, doing her fourteen miles without a murmur. As they neared Penzance the sea moderated and they swung into the channel on an almost even keel. Good harbours beckoned, and the plan of lying by until after dinner was discussed and finally abandoned. Edgartown was only another hour's sail and it would be better to keep on and lie in there for dinner. But when the _Adventurer_ had passed into Vineyard Sound Steve began to wish he had waited. A bank of grey mist hid the island toward which they were headed and he feared they would find themselves in it before they could reach the nearest harbour, which was Vineyard Haven. But since the _Adventurer_ had already left Wood's Holl two miles behind and Vineyard Haven Harbour was only some four miles further it seemed silly to turn back. There was always the chance that the fog would blow off, besides. Nevertheless Steve frowned dubiously through the moist pane ahead and, without saying anything of his fears to the rest, drew the throttle a few notches down and kept the _Adventurer_ close to her course. Behind, the _Follow Me_ speeded up as well and the two boats hurried for where, out of sight in the grey void ahead, West Chop pointed a blunt nose to sea.  But it was a losing race, for ten minutes later Steve saw that the fog bank was rolling down upon them and from somewhere to the eastward came the dismal hoot of a steamer feeling her way along. Joe, too, saw what they were in for and turned anxiously to Steve. \"That's fog, isn't it?\" he asked.  Steve nodded. \"Get the fog-horn ready, will you? We don't want anyone bumping into us. I'm going to slow down to six miles. There's too much water here to drop anchor in.\" He eyed the advancing fog distastefully and then shrugged his shoulders. \"You've got to learn some time, I suppose, Joe, and here's where I learn to make harbour by the compass. Now we're in it!\"  At that instant the grey mist enveloped them silently, chillingly. Joe drew a long wail from the fog-horn and in response a similar but higher-keyed wail came through the fog from the _Follow Me_. And at the same moment the other members of the ship's company stuck inquiring heads through the companion ways.  \"Hello,\" exclaimed Perry. \"Fog! Gee, that's exciting! Say, you can't see a thing, can you? Look, fellows, the boat hasn't any bow!\"  \"Nor any stern,\" added Han. \"You can almost taste the stuff. Say, Steve, isn't it hard to steer in a fog?\"  \"Not a bit,\" answered Steve cheerfully. \"Steering's perfectly easy. The only trouble is to steer right.\"  \"To-o-ot!\" said the fog-horn and was answered from astern. Then somewhere to the south-eastward a siren sent a wailing cry, subdued by distance. The fog settled on everything and shone on the boys' sweaters in little beads of moisture. The _Adventurer_ seemed to be standing still, for, with nothing to judge by, progress was made known only by the slow lazy throb of the engine. Even the water alongside was scarcely discernible. Joe pulled the lever of the fog-horn again, and this time, beside the response from the _Follow Me_, an answering bellow came across the water.  \"A steamer,\" muttered Steve, peering uselessly into the grey void. \"She's a good ways off, though. Give her another pull, Joe.\"  Again the _Adventurer_ proclaimed her position but there was no answer from the steamer. \"She doesn't seem very talkative,\" said Phil. \"How fast are we going, "]]]
