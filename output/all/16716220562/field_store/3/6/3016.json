We could not--or at least we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our laboratories out of inorganic materials.  The gulf between the dead and the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge. But there was a higher and subtler chemistry of Nature, which, working with great forces over long epochs, might well produce results which were impossible for us.  There the matter must be left.  This brought the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life, beginning low down in molluscs and feeble sea creatures, then up rung by rung through reptiles and fishes, till at last we came to a kangaroo-rat, a creature which brought forth its young alive, the direct ancestor of all mammals, and presumably, therefore, of everyone in the audience. (\"No, no,\" from a sceptical student in the back row.)  If the young gentleman in the red tie who cried \"No, no,\" and who presumably claimed to have been hatched out of an egg, would wait upon him after the lecture, he would be glad to see such a curiosity.  (Laughter.)  It was strange to think that the climax of all the age-long process of Nature had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie.  But had the process stopped?  Was this gentleman to be taken as the final type--the be-all and end-all of development?  He hoped that he would not hurt the feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that, whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life, still the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they were to end entirely in his production.  Evolution was not a spent force, but one still working, and even greater achievements were in store.  Having thus, amid a general titter, played very prettily with his interrupter, the lecturer went back to his picture of the past, the drying of the seas, the emergence of the sand-bank, the sluggish, viscous life which lay upon their margins, the overcrowded lagoons, the tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mud-flats, the abundance of food awaiting them, their consequent enormous growth. \"Hence, ladies and gentlemen,\" he added, \"that frightful brood of saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the Wealden or in the Solenhofen slates, but which were fortunately extinct long before the first appearance of mankind upon this planet.\"  \"Question!\" boomed a voice from the platform.  Mr. Waldron was a strict disciplinarian with a gift of acid humor, as exemplified upon the gentleman with the red tie, which made it perilous to interrupt him.  But this interjection appeared to him so absurd that he was at a loss how to deal with it.  So looks the Shakespearean who is confronted by a rancid Baconian, or the astronomer who is assailed by a flat-earth fanatic.  He paused for a moment, and then, raising his voice, repeated slowly the words:  \"Which were extinct before the coming of man.\"  \"Question!\" boomed the voice once more.  Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who leaned back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if he were smiling in his sleep.  \"I see!\" said Waldron, with a shrug.  \"It is my friend Professor Challenger,\" and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a final explanation and no more need be said.  But the incident was far from being closed.  Whatever path the lecturer took amid the wilds of the past seemed invariably to lead him to some assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the same bulls' bellow from the Professor.  The audience began to anticipate it and to roar with delight when it came.  The packed benches of students joined in, and every time Challenger's beard opened, before any sound could come forth, there was a yell of \"Question!\" from a hundred voices, and an answering counter cry of \"Order!\" and \"Shame!\" from as many more.  Waldron, though a hardened lecturer and a strong man, became rattled.  He hesitated, stammered, repeated himself, got snarled in a long sentence, and finally turned furiously upon the cause of his troubles.  \"This is really intolerable!\" he cried, glaring across the platform. \"I must ask you, Professor Challenger, to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruptions.\"  There was a hush over the hall, the students rigid with delight at seeing the high gods on Olympus quarrelling among themselves. Challenger levered his bulky figure slowly out of his chair.  \"I must in turn ask you, Mr. Waldron,\" he said, \"to cease to make assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact.\"  The words unloosed a tempest.  \"Shame!  Shame!\"  \"Give him a hearing!\" \"Put him out!\"  \"Shove him off the platform!\"  \"Fair play!\" emerged from a general roar of amusement or execration.  The chairman was on his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly.  \"Professor Challenger--personal--views--later,\" were the solid peaks above his clouds of inaudible mutter.  The interrupter bowed, smiled, stroked his beard, and relapsed into his chair.  Waldron, very flushed and warlike, continued his observations.  Now and then, as he made an assertion, he shot a venomous glance at his opponent, who seemed to be slumbering deeply, with the same broad, happy smile upon his face.  At last the lecture came to an end--I am inclined to think that it was a premature one, as the peroration was hurried and disconnected.  The thread of the argument had been rudely broken, and the audience was restless and expectant.  Waldron sat down, and, after a chirrup from the chairman, Professor Challenger rose and advanced to the edge of the platform.  In the interests of my paper I took down his speech verbatim.  \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he began, amid a sustained interruption from the back.  \"I beg pardon--Ladies, Gentlemen, and Children--I must apologize, I had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this audience\" (tumult, during which the Professor stood with one hand raised and his enormous head nodding sympathetically, as if he were bestowing a pontifical blessing upon the crowd), \"I have been selected to move a vote of thanks to Mr. Waldron for the very picturesque and imaginative address to which we have just listened.  There are points in it with which I disagree, and it has been my duty to indicate them as they arose, but, none the less, Mr. Waldron has accomplished his object well, that object being to give a simple and interesting account of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet.  Popular lectures are the easiest to listen to, but Mr. Waldron\" (here he beamed and blinked at the lecturer) \"will excuse me when I say that they are necessarily both superficial and misleading, since they have to be graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience.\"  (Ironical cheering.)  \"Popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic.\"  (Angry gesture of protest from Mr. Waldron.)  \"They exploit for fame or cash the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren. One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory, one brick built into the temple of science, far outweighs any second-hand exposition which passes an idle hour, but can leave no useful result behind it.  I put forward this obvious reflection, not out of any desire to disparage Mr. Waldron in particular, but that you may not lose your sense of proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest.\" (At this point Mr. Waldron whispered to the chairman, who half rose and said something severely to his water-carafe.)  \"But enough of this!\"  (Loud and prolonged cheers.)  \"Let me pass to some subject of wider interest. What is the particular point upon which I, as an original investigator, have challenged our lecturer's accuracy?  It is upon the permanence of certain types of animal life upon the earth.  I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts, when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal, therefore these creatures no longer exist.  They are indeed, as he has said, our ancestors, but they are, if I may use the expression, our contemporary ancestors, who can still be found with all their hideous and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood to seek their haunts.  Creatures which were supposed to be Jurassic, monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest mammals, still exist.\" (Cries of \"Bosh!\" \"Prove it!\" \"How do YOU know?\" \"Question!\") \"How do I know, you ask me? I know because I have visited their secret haunts.  I know because I have seen some of them.\" (Applause, uproar, and a voice, \"Liar!\")  \"Am I a liar?\" (General hearty and noisy assent.)  \"Did I hear someone say that I was a liar? Will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that I may know him?\"  (A voice, \"Here he is, sir!\" and an inoffensive little person in spectacles, struggling violently, was held up among a group of students.)  \"Did you venture to call me a liar?\"  (\"No, sir, no!\" shouted the accused, and disappeared like a jack-in-the-box.)  \"If any person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity, I shall be glad to have a few words with him after the lecture.\"  (\"Liar!\")  \"Who said that?\" (Again the inoffensive one plunging desperately, was elevated high into the air.) \"If I come down among you----\" (General chorus of \"Come, love, come!\" which interrupted the proceedings for some moments, while the chairman, standing up and waving both his arms, seemed to be conducting the music.  The Professor, with his face flushed, his nostrils dilated, and his beard bristling, was now in a proper Berserk mood.)  \"Every great discoverer has been met with the same incredulity--the sure brand of a generation of fools.

Harper & Bothers and Henry Mills Alden whose friendliness and fair dealing I am glad of this chance to record  Owen Wister     Preface       It's very plain that if a thing's the fashion--        Too much the fashion--if the people leap      To do it, or to be it, in a passion        Of haste and crowding, like a herd of sheep,       Why then that thing becomes through imitation        Vulgar, excessive, obvious, and cheap.       No gentleman desires to be pursuing       What every Tom and Dick and Harry's doing.       Stranger, do you write books? I ask the question,        Because I'm told that everybody writes      That what with scribbling, eating, and digestion,        And proper slumber, all our days and nights       Are wholly filled. It seems an odd suggestion--        But if you do write, stop it, leave the masses,        Read me, and join the small selected classes.     The Jimmyjohn Boss   I  One day at Nampa, which is in Idaho, a ruddy old massive jovial man stood by the Silver City stage, patting his beard with his left hand, and with his right the shoulder of a boy who stood beside him. He had come with the boy on the branch train from Boise, because he was a careful German and liked to say everything twice--twice at least when it was a matter of business. This was a matter of very particular business, and the German had repeated himself for nineteen miles. Presently the east-bound on the main line would arrive from Portland; then the Silver City stage would take the boy south on his new mission, and the man would journey by the branch train back to Boise. From Boise no one could say where he might not go, west or east. He was a great and pervasive cattle man in Oregon, California, and other places. Vogel and Lex--even to-day you may hear the two ranch partners spoken of. So the veteran Vogel was now once more going over his notions and commands to his youthful deputy during the last precious minutes until the east-bound should arrive.  “Und if only you haf someding like dis,” said the old man, as he tapped his beard and patted the boy, “it would be five hoondert more dollars salary in your liddle pants.”  The boy winked up at his employer. He had a gray, humorous eye; he was slim and alert, like a sparrow-hawk--the sort of boy his father openly rejoices in and his mother is secretly in prayer over. Only, this boy had neither father nor mother. Since the age of twelve he had looked out for himself, never quite without bread, sometimes attaining champagne, getting along in his American way variously, on horse or afoot, across regions of wide plains and mountains, through towns where not a soul knew his name. He closed one of his gray eyes at his employer, and beyond this made no remark.  “Vat you mean by dat vink, anyhow?” demanded the elder.  “Say,” said the boy, confidentially--“honest now. How about you and me? Five hundred dollars if I had your beard. You've got a record and I've got a future. And my bloom's on me rich, without a scratch. How many dollars you gif me for dat bloom?” The sparrow-hawk sailed into a freakish imitation of his master.  “You are a liddle rascal!” cried the master, shaking with entertainment. “Und if der peoples vas to hear you sass old Max Vogel in dis style they would say, 'Poor old Max, he lose his gr-rip.' But I don't lose it.” His great hand closed suddenly on the boy's shoulder, his voice cut clean and heavy as an axe, and then no more joking about him. “Haf you understand that?” he said.  “Yes, sir.”  “How old are you, son?”  “Nineteen, sir.”  “Oh my, that is offle young for the job I gif you. Some of dose man you go to boss might be your father. Und how much do you weigh?”  “About a hundred and thirty.”  “Too light, too light. Und I haf keep my eye on you in Boise. You are not so goot a boy as you might be.”  “Well, sir, I guess not.”  “But you was not so bad a boy as you might be, neider. You don't lie about it. Now it must be farewell to all that foolishness. Haf you understand? You go to set an example where one is needed very bad. If those men see you drink a liddle, they drink a big lot. You forbid them, they laugh at you. You must not allow one drop of whiskey at the whole place. Haf you well understand?”  “Yes, sir. Me and whiskey are not necessary to each other's happiness.”  “It is not you, it is them. How are you mit your gun?”  Vogel took the boy's pistol from its holster and aimed at an empty bottle which was sticking in the thin Deceiver snow. “Can you do this?”  he said, carelessly, and fired. The snow struck the bottle, but the unharming bullet was buried half an inch to the left.  The boy took his pistol with solemnity. “No,” he said. “Guess I can't do that.” He fired, and the glass splintered into shapelessness. “Told you I couldn't miss as close as you did,” said he.  “You are a darling,” said Mr. Vogel. “Gif me dat lofely weapon.”  A fortunate store of bottles lay, leaned, or stood about in the white snow of Nampa, and Mr. Vogel began at them.  “May I ask if anything is the matter?” inquired a mild voice from the stage.  “Stick that lily head in-doors,” shouted Vogel; and the face and eye-glasses withdrew again into the stage. “The school-teacher he will be beautifool virtuous company for you at Malheur Agency,” continued Vogel, shooting again; and presently the large old German destroyed a bottle with a crashing smack. “Ah!” said he, in unison with the smack. “Ah-ha! No von shall say der old Max lose his gr-rip. I shoot it efry time now, but the train she whistle. I hear her.”  The boy affected to listen earnestly.  “Bah! I tell you I hear de whistle coming.”  “Did you say there was a whistle?” ventured the occupant of the stage. The snow shone white on his glasses as he peered out.  “Nobody whistle for you,” returned the robust Vogel. “You listen to me,”  he continued to the boy. “You are offle yoong. But I watch you plenty this long time. I see you work mit my stock on the Owyhee and the Malheur; I see you mit my oder men. My men they say always more and more, 'Yoong Drake he is a goot one,' und I think you are a goot one mine own self. I am the biggest cattle man on the Pacific slope, und I am also an old devil. I have think a lot, und I like you.”  “I'm obliged to you, sir.”  “Shut oop. I like you, und therefore I make you my new sooperintendent at my Malheur Agency r-ranch, mit a bigger salary as you don't get before. If you are a sookcess, I r-raise you some more.”  “I am satisfied now, sir.”  “Bah! Never do you tell any goot business man you are satisfied mit vat he gif you, for eider he don't believe you or else he think you are a fool. Und eider ways you go down in his estimation. You make those men at Malheur Agency behave themselves und I r-raise you. Only I do vish, I do certainly vish you had some beard on that yoong chin.”  The boy glanced at his pistol.  “No, no, no, my son,” said the sharp old German. “I don't want gunpowder in dis affair. You must act kviet und decisif und keep your liddle shirt on. What you accomplish shootin'? You kill somebody, und then, pop! somebody kills you. What goot is all that nonsense to me?”  “It would annoy me some, too,” retorted the boy, eyeing the capitalist. “Don't leave me out of the proposition.”  “Broposition! Broposition! Now you get hot mit old Max for nothing.”  “If you didn't contemplate trouble,” pursued the boy, “what was your point just now in sampling my marksmanship?” He kicked some snow in the direction of the shattered bottle. “It's understood no whiskey comes on that ranch. But if no gunpowder goes along with me, either, let's call the deal off. Buy some other fool.”  “You haf not understand, my boy. Und you get very hot because I happen to make that liddle joke about somebody killing you. Was you thinking maybe old Max not care what happen to you?”  A moment of silence passed before the answer came: “Suppose we talk business?”  “Very well, very well. Only notice this thing. When oder peoples talk oop to me like you haf done many times, it is not they who does the getting hot. It is me--old Max. Und when old Max gets hot he slings them out of his road anywheres. Some haf been very sorry they get so slung. You invite me to buy some oder fool? Oh, my boy, I will buy no oder fool except you, for that was just like me when I was yoong Max!” Again the ruddy and grizzled magnate put his hand on the shoulder of the boy, who stood looking away at the bottles, at the railroad track, at anything save his employer.  The employer proceeded: “I was afraid of nobody und noding in those days. You are afraid of nobody and noding. But those days was different. No Pullman sleepers, no railroad at all. We come oop the Columbia in the steamboat, we travel hoonderts of miles by team, we sleep, we eat nowheres in particular mit many unexpected interooptions. There was Indians, there was offle bad white men, und if you was not offle yourself you vanished quickly. Therefore in those days was Max Vogel hell und repeat.”  The magnate smiled a broad fond smile over the past which he had kicked, driven, shot, bled, and battled through to present power; and the boy winked up at him again now.  “I don't propose to vanish, myself,” said he.  “Ah-ha! you was no longer mad mit der old Max! Of coorse I care what happens to you. I was alone in the world myself in those lofely wicked days.”  Reserve again made flinty the boy's face.  “Neider did I talk about my feelings,” continued Max Vogel, “but I nefer show them too quick. If I was injured I wait, and I strike to kill. We all paddles our own dugout, eh? We ask no favors from nobody; we must win our spurs! Not so? Now I talk business with you where you interroopt me. If cow-boys was not so offle scarce in the country, I would long ago haf bounce the lot of those drunken fellows. But they cannot be spared; we must get along so.
