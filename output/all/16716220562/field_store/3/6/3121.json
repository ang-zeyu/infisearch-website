Nature herself, it seemed, would raise      A minster to her Maker's praise!   HOW TO PARSE NOUNS.   69. Parsing a word is putting together all the facts about its form and its relations to other words in the sentence.  In parsing, some idioms--the double possessive, for example--do not come under regular grammatical rules, and are to be spoken of merely as idioms.  70. Hence, in parsing a noun, we state,--  (1) The class to which it belongs,--common, proper, etc.  (2) Whether a neuter or a gender noun; if the latter, which gender.  (3) Whether singular or plural number.  (4) Its office in the sentence, determining its case.  [Sidenote: _The correct method._]  71. In parsing any word, the following method should always be followed: tell the facts about what the word _does_, then make the grammatical statements as to its class, inflections, and relations.   MODEL FOR PARSING.  \"What is bolder than a miller's neckcloth, which takes a thief by the throat every morning?\"  _Miller's_ is a name applied to every individual of its class, hence it is a common noun; it is the name of a male being, hence it is a gender noun, masculine; it denotes only one person, therefore singular number; it expresses possession or ownership, and limits _neckcloth_, therefore possessive case.  _Neckcloth_, like _miller's_, is a common class noun; it has no sex, therefore neuter; names one thing, therefore singular number; subject of the verb _is_ understood, and therefore nominative case.  _Thief_ is a common class noun; the connection shows a male is meant, therefore masculine gender; singular number; object of the verb _takes_, hence objective case.  _Throat_ is neuter, of the same class and number as the word _neckcloth_; it is the object of the preposition _by_, hence it is objective case.  NOTE.--The preposition sometimes takes the possessive case (see Sec. 68).  _Morning_ is like _throat_ and _neckcloth_ as to class, gender, and number; as to case, it expresses time, has no governing word, but is the adverbial objective.   Exercise.   Follow the model above in parsing all the nouns in the following sentences:--   1. To raise a monument to departed worth is to perpetuate virtue.  2. The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by stealth, and to have it found out by accident.  3. An old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered serving man, a fresh tapster.  4. That in the captain's but a choleric word,      Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.  5. Now, blessings light on him that first invented ... sleep!  6. Necker, financial minister to Louis XVI., and his daughter, Madame de Staël, were natives of Geneva.  7. He giveth his beloved sleep.  8. Time makes the worst enemies friends.  9. A few miles from this point, where the Rhone enters the lake, stands the famous Castle of Chillon, connected with the shore by a drawbridge,--palace, castle, and prison, all in one.  10. Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth,      And hated her for her pride.  11. Mrs. Jarley's back being towards him, the military gentleman shook his forefinger.     PRONOUNS.   [Sidenote: _The need of pronouns._]  72. When we wish to speak of a name several times in succession, it is clumsy and tiresome to repeat the noun. For instance, instead of saying, \"_The pupil_ will succeed in _the pupil's_ efforts if _the pupil_ is ambitious,\" we improve the sentence by shortening it thus, \"The pupil will succeed in _his_ efforts if _he_ is ambitious.\"  Again, if we wish to know about the ownership of a house, we evidently cannot state the owner's name, but by a question we say, \"_Whose_ house is that?\" thus placing a word instead of the name till we learn the name.  This is not to be understood as implying that pronouns were _invented_ because nouns were tiresome, since history shows that pronouns are as old as nouns and verbs. The use of pronouns must have sprung up naturally, from a necessity for short, definite, and representative words.  [Sidenote: _Definition._]  A pronoun is a reference word, standing for a name, or for a person or thing, or for a group of persons or things.   [Sidenote: _Classes of pronouns._]  73. Pronouns may be grouped in five classes:--  (1) Personal pronouns, which distinguish person by their form (Sec. 76).  (2) Interrogative pronouns, which are used to ask questions about persons or things.  (3) Relative pronouns, which relate or refer to a noun, pronoun, or other word or expression, and at the same time connect two statements They are also called conjunctive.  (4) Adjective pronouns, words, primarily adjectives, which are classed as adjectives when they modify nouns, but as pronouns when they stand for nouns.  (5) Indefinite pronouns, which cannot be used as adjectives, but stand for an indefinite number of persons or things.  Numerous examples of all these will be given under the separate classes hereafter treated.   PERSONAL PRONOUNS.   [Sidenote: _Person in grammar._]  74. Since pronouns stand for persons as well as names, they must represent the person talking, the person or thing spoken to, and the person or thing talked about.  This gives rise to a new term, \"the distinction of _person_.\"  [Sidenote: Person _of nouns_.]  75. This distinction was not needed in discussing nouns, as nouns have the _same form_, whether representing persons and things spoken to or spoken of. It is evident that a noun could not represent the person speaking, even if it had a special form.  From analogy to pronouns, which have _forms_ for person, nouns are sometimes spoken of as first or second person by their _use_; that is, if they are in apposition with a pronoun of the first or second person, they are said to have person by agreement.  But usually nouns represent something spoken of.   [Sidenote: _Three persons of pronouns._]  76. Pronouns naturally are of three persons:--  (1) First person, representing the person speaking.  (2) Second person, representing a person or thing spoken to.  (3) Third person, standing for a person or thing spoken of.    FORMS OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.  77. Personal pronouns are inflected thus:--                            FIRST PERSON.                           _Singular._ _Nom._                         I _Poss._                    mine, my _Obj._                         me                             _Plural._ _Nom._                        we _Poss._                    our, ours _Obj._                        us                            SECOND PERSON.                           _Singular._                    _Old Form_   _Common Form._ _Nom._              thou               you _Poss._          thine, thy        your, yours _Obj._              thee               you                            _Plural._ _Nom._              ye                 you _Poss._          your, yours        your, yours _Obj._              you                you                           THIRD PERSON.                            _Singular._                    _Masc._   _Fem._   _Neut._. _Nom._            he          she       it _Poss._           his      her, hers    its _Obj._            him         her       it                        _Plur. of all Three_. _Nom._                       they _Poss._                 their, theirs _Obj._                       them   Remarks on These Forms.   [Sidenote: _First and second persons without gender._]  78. It will be noticed that the pronouns of the first and second persons have no forms to distinguish gender. The speaker may be either male or female, or, by personification, neuter; so also with the person or thing spoken to.  [Sidenote: _Third person_ singular _has gender_.]  But the third person has, in the singular, a separate form for each gender, and also for the neuter.  [Sidenote: _Old forms_.]  In Old English these three were formed from the same root; namely, masculine _hē_, feminine _hēo_, neuter _hit_.  The form _hit_ (for _it_) is still heard in vulgar English, and _hoo_ (for _hēo_) in some dialects of England.  The plurals were _hī_, _heora_, _heom_, in Old English; the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],["title","An English Grammar (#8)"],["body"," _they_, _their_, _them_, perhaps being from the English demonstrative, though influenced by the cognate Norse forms.   [Sidenote: _Second person always plural in ordinary English._]  79. _Thou_, _thee_, etc., are old forms which are now out of use in ordinary speech. The consequence is, that we have no singular pronoun of the second person in ordinary speech or prose, but make the plural _you_ do duty for the singular. We use it with a plural verb always, even when referring to a single object.  [Sidenote: _Two uses of the old singulars._]   80. There are, however, two modern uses of _thou, thy_, etc.:--  (1) _In elevated style_, especially in poetry; as,--          With _thy_ clear keen joyance           Languor cannot be;         Shadow of annoyance           Never came near _thee_;      _Thou_ lovest; but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.--SHELLEY.  (2) _In addressing the Deity_, as in prayers, etc.; for example,--       Oh, _thou_ Shepherd of Israel, that didst comfort _thy_ people of      old, to _thy_ care we commit the helpless.--BEECHER.   [Sidenote: _The form_ its.]  81. It is worth while to consider the possessive _its_. This is of comparatively recent growth. The old form was _his_ (from the nominative _hit_), and this continued in use till the sixteenth century. The transition from the old _his_ to the modern _its_ is shown in these sentences:--       1 He anointed the altar and all _his_ vessels.--_Bible_  Here _his_ refers to _altar_, which is a neuter noun. The quotation represents the usage of the early sixteenth century.       2 It's had _it_ head bit off by _it_ young--SHAKESPEARE  Shakespeare uses _his_, _it_, and sometimes _its_, as possessive of _it_.  In Milton's poetry (seventeenth century) _its_ occurs only three times.       3 See heaven _its_ sparkling portals wide display--POPE   [Sidenote: _A relic of the olden time._]  82. We have an interesting relic in such sentences as this from Thackeray: \"One of the ways to know '_em_ is to watch the scared looks of the ogres' wives and children.\"  As shown above, the Old English objective was _hem_ (or _heom_), which was often sounded with the _h_ silent, just as we now say, \"I saw '_im_ yesterday\" when the word _him_ is not emphatic. In spoken English, this form '_em_ has survived side by side with the literary _them_.   [Sidenote: _Use of the pronouns in personification._]  83. The pronouns _he_ and _she_ are often used in poetry, and sometimes in ordinary speech, to personify objects (Sec. 34).    CASES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.   I The Nominative.   [Sidenote: _Nominative forms._]  84. The nominative forms of personal pronouns have the same uses as the nominative of nouns (see Sec. 58). The case of most of these pronouns can be determined more easily than the case of nouns, for, besides a nominative _use_, they have a nominative form. The words _I_, _thou_, _he_, _she_, _we_, _ye_, _they_, are very rarely anything but nominative in literary English, though _ye_ is occasionally used as objective.   [Sidenote: _Additional nominatives in spoken English._]  85. In spoken English, however, there are some others that are added to the list of nominatives: they are, _me_, _him_, _her_, _us_, _them_, when they occur in the _predicate position_. That is, in such a sentence as, \"I am sure it was _him_,\" the literary language would require _he_ after _was_; but colloquial English regularly uses as predicate nominatives the forms _me_, _him_, _her_, _us_, _them_, though those named in Sec. 84 are always subjects. Yet careful speakers avoid this, and follow the usage of literary English.   II. The Possessive.   [Sidenote: _Not a separate class._]  86. The forms _my_, _thy_, _his_, _her_, _its_, _our_, _your_, _their_, are sometimes grouped separately as POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS, but it is better to speak of them as the possessive case of personal pronouns, just as we speak of the possessive case of nouns, and not make more classes.  [Sidenote: Absolute _personal pronouns._]  The forms _mine_, _thine_, _yours_, _hers_, _theirs_, sometimes _his_ and _its_, have a peculiar use, standing apart from the words they modify instead of immediately before them. From this use they are called ABSOLUTE PERSONAL PRONOUNS, or, some say, ABSOLUTE POSSESSIVES.  As instances of the use of absolute pronouns, note the following:--       'Twas _mine_, 'tis _his_, and has been slave to thousands.      --SHAKESPEARE.       And since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee _mine_.--COWPER.       My arm better than _theirs_ can ward it off.--LANDOR.       _Thine_ are the city and the people of Granada.--BULWER.  [Sidenote: _Old use of_ mine _and_ thine.]  Formerly _mine_ and _thine_ stood before their nouns, if the nouns began with a vowel or _h_ silent; thus,--       Shall I not take _mine_ ease in _mine_ inn?--SHAKESPEARE.       Give every man _thine_ ear, but few thy voice.--_Id._       If _thine_ eye offend thee, pluck it out.--_Bible._       My greatest apprehension was for _mine_ eyes.--SWIFT.  This usage is still preserved in poetry.   [Sidenote: _Double and triple possessives._]  87. The forms _hers_, _ours_, _yours_, _theirs_, are really double possessives, since they add the possessive _s_ to what is already a regular possessive inflection.  Besides this, we have, as in nouns, a possessive phrase made up of the preposition _of_ with these double possessives, _hers_, _ours_, _yours_, _theirs_, and with _mine_, _thine_, _his_, sometimes _its_.  [Sidenote: _Their uses._]  Like the noun possessives, they have several uses:--  (1) _To prevent ambiguity_, as in the following:--       I have often contrasted the habitual qualities of that gloomy      friend _of theirs_ with the astounding spirits of Thackeray and      Dickens.--J.T. FIELDS.       No words _of ours_ can describe the fury of the conflict.--J.F.      COOPER.  (2) _To bring emphasis_, as in these sentences:--       This thing _of yours_ that you call a Pardon of Sins, it is a bit      of rag-paper with ink.--CARLYLE.       This ancient silver bowl _of mine_, it tells of good old times.      --HOLMES.  (3) _To express contempt, anger, or satire_; for example,--       \"Do you know the charges that unhappy sister _of mine_ and her      family have put me to already?\" says the Master.--THACKERAY.       He [John Knox] had his pipe of Bordeaux too, we find, in that old      Edinburgh house _of his_.--CARLYLE.       \"Hold thy peace, Long Allen,\" said Henry Woodstall, \"I tell thee      that tongue _of thine_ is not the shortest limb about      _thee_.\"--SCOTT.  (4) _To make a noun less limited in application_; thus,--       A favorite liar and servant _of mine_ was a man I once had to      drive a brougham.--THACKERAY.       In New York I read a newspaper criticism one day, commenting upon      a letter _of mine_.--_Id._  What would the last two sentences mean if the word _my_ were written instead of _of mine_, and preceded the nouns?   [Sidenote: _About the case of absolute pronouns._]  88. In their function, or use in a sentence, the absolute possessive forms of the personal pronouns are very much like adjectives used as nouns.  In such sentences as, \"_The good_ alone are great,\" \"None but _the brave_ deserves _the fair_,\" the words italicized have an adjective force and also a noun force, as shown in Sec. 20.  So in the sentences illustrating absolute pronouns in Sec. 86: _mine_ stands for _my property_, _his_ for _his property_, in the first sentence; _mine_ stands for _my praise_ in the second. But the first two have a nominative use, and _mine_ in the second has an objective use.  They may be spoken of as possessive in form, but nominative or objective in use, according as the modified word is in the nominative or the objective.    III. The Objective.   [Sidenote: _The old_ dative _case._]  89. In Old English there was one case which survives in use, but not in form. In such a sentence as this one from Thackeray, \"Pick _me_ out a whip-cord thong with some dainty knots in it,\" the word _me_ is evidently not the direct object of the verb, but expresses _for whom_, _for whose benefit_, the thing is done. In pronouns, this dative use, as it is called, was marked by a separate case.  [Sidenote: _Now the objective._]  In Modern English the same _use_ is frequently seen, but the _form_ is the same as the objective. For this reason a word thus used is called a dative-objective.  The following are examples of the dative-objective:--       Give _me_ neither poverty nor riches.--_Bible._       Curse _me_ this people.--_Id._       Both joined in making _him_ a present.--MACAULAY       Is it not enough that you have _burnt me_ down three houses with      your dog's tricks, and be hanged to you!--LAMB       I give _thee_ this to wear at the collar.--SCOTT   [Sidenote: _Other uses of the objective._]  90. Besides this use of the objective, there are others:--  (1) _As the direct object of a verb._       They all handled _it_.--LAMB  (2) _As the object of a preposition._       Time is behind _them_ and before _them_.--CARLYLE.  (3) _In apposition._       She sate all last summer by the bedside of the blind beggar,      _him_ that so often and so gladly I talked with.--DE QUINCEY.    SPECIAL USES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.   [Sidenote: _Indefinite use of_ you _and_ your.]  91. The word _you_, and its possessive case _yours_ are sometimes used without reference to a particular person spoken to. They approach the indefinite pronoun in use.       _Your_ mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of      the rod, was passed by with indulgence.--IRVING       To empty here, _you_ must condense there.--EMERSON.       The peasants take off their hats as _you_ pass; _you_ sneeze, and      they cry, \"God bless you!\" The thrifty housewife shows _you_ into      her best chamber. _You_ have oaten cakes baked some months      before.--LONGFELLOW   [Sidenote: _Uses of_ it.]  92. The pronoun _it_ has a number of uses:--  (1) _To refer to some single "]]]
