Put them in mind to be subject to      principalities and powers to obey magistrates, to be ready      for every good work.       Ro. xiii. 1-7. Let every soul be subject unto the higher      powers. For there is no power but of God, the powers that be,      are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the      power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist      shall receive to themselves damnation: (harm, loss, or ruin).      For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.      Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is      good and thou shalt have praise of the same: for he is the      minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which      is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for      he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon      him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not      only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake. For, for this      cause pay ye tribute also, for they are God's ministers,      attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore      to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to      whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.   There are two great classes of human duty. One of them embraces duties which we owe to God, the other embraces duties which we owe to men.  This classification of duties received the sanction of Jesus Christ, when he spake of _loving the Lord our God with all our heart_, as the spirit and sum of the one class of duties, and of _loving our neighbor as ourselves_, as the spirit and sum of the other class of duties. It had also been previously taught at Mount Sinai, when God gave to Moses the two tables of the law--the one enjoining our duty to God, the other enjoining our duty to man.  This classification of duties is not arbitrary. It is founded on truth and nature. Men have relations to God, as their Creator, Upholder, Governor, Redeemer, and rightful Judge; and they are bound to recognize these relations, and feel and act accordingly. Men hold relations to one another, as parents, children, citizens, rulers, and subjects; and they are bound to recognize these relations, and feel and act accordingly. Such is the will of God. Such is the law of God. There can be no holiness in man aside from conformity to the will of God in this thing.  This principle is carried out in all the teachings of the New Testament, with an emphasis and a plainness which no candid and unprejudiced mind can fail to understand. Jesus Christ has incorporated it into his sermon on the mount in many particulars, wherein he insists upon our social duties, while he teaches religion. He preached this principle when he said, \"render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\" He practised on this principle when he made the fish bring in his mouth the tribute-money which, as a citizen, he owed to the government of the country,--a government a thousandfold more oppressive than ours.  It would be a fundamental error, if we were to maintain, that _religion_ has nothing to do with the regulation of our conduct towards one another,--as parents, as children, as magistrates, subjects and citizens; but that it has left all that field of duty to be regulated by the individual preferences of men. It has not done so. Social duties come as really within the field of _religious_ obligation, as any other duties. \"The fifth commandment requireth the preserving the honor and performing the duties belonging to every one in their several places and relations, as superiors, inferiors, and equals.\" As men, in any relationship we hold, neighbors, citizens of the state, children, parents, or any other earthly connection, religion extends its authority over us; and our conduct in each one of these relationships constitutes a part of our holiness or our sin.  God has not seen fit to enact special or particular laws for us, to regulate our conduct in all respects, as here associated with one another, and owing duties to one another, as neighbors, citizens of the commonwealth, husbands, wives, and children. He has himself enacted only _general_ laws for us,--laid down great general principles, under the authority and light of which, he has left men to regulate the particulars as they please, by the governments which they establish.--only not contravening his great general principles and laws.  He has himself made _all_ the laws which are needful, and all which can be justly obligatory upon us in respect to _divine worship_,--such duties as praise, prayer, preaching the gospel, and observing the sacramental ordinances;--and no human authority may either repeal these laws or add to them. But in respect to the duties which we owe to our neighbor, that is, to our fellow-man, in any relation he holds to us or can ever hold; God has left the most of these duties to the authoritative decision of human governments. He has thus made a difference betwixt these two classes of duties. The reason for this difference seems to be this; namely, man's wisdom can reach farther in ascertaining what is fit or right betwixt him and his fellow-man, than in ascertaining what is fit or right betwixt him and his God: and consequently, man can legislate in respect to property, and other matters of human right, but not in respect to prayer, and other matters of the first class of duties. Moreover, in respect to worship, God is himself one of the parties. The parties are not man and man, as they are in all social duties; but they are man and God:--and therefore, it would seem but fit and natural, that God should legislate _exclusively_ in respect to the duties which we owe to _Him_, and more specifically, than in respect to the duties which we owe to one another. Hence, we find it so. Explicit divine law regulates all the _particulars_ of the one class of duties; the _particulars_ of the other class of duties are left to human law, or the regulations of human society.  But this latter class of duties, that is, our social duties, are _not left_ to the _individual_ judgment or independent choice of men, in such a sense, that they may obey or disobey human government just as they please. Not in the least. Human government is by the divine will. Obedience to it is obligatory upon men, by the will and law of God. St. Paul directing Titus how to preach, (and therefore directing all ministers of the gospel who come after him,) says to him, \"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates:\" and I am doing it in this sermon. Human government is of divine authority, not the _kind_, but the fact. And consequently, our action about human government, our obedience to it, and our disobedience, are as much matters of religion, and coming under its authority and obligation, as are any other matters. If religion had nothing to do with them, I would have nothing to do with them here. But it _has_ something to do with them. Human government is a divine ordinance. It is of divine authority. It is _not_ a thing of mere human authority. Our _religion_, therefore, our holiness and final salvation are concerned in our sentiments, principles, and conduct in reference to human government. If God _has_ left to men the choice of the _kind_ of government they will have, he has _not_ left it to their choice whether they will _obey_ human government or not. He has commanded that obedience. Human government and law are by the will of God. This is a religious principle. And almost the entire sum of our second class of duties, by the will of God, lies under the regulation of human government. God has himself legislated in respect to the other class of duties. Human government is founded on the revealed will of God.  The different expressions contained in the texts which we have just read in your hearing, place this principle beyond all controversy. Glance at them again. \"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates.\" (I am doing so--I am preaching gospel this morning.) \"Let every"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13988"],["title","Fugitive Slave Law (#1)"],["body","be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but _of God_. The powers that be, are ordained _of God_. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance _of God_. Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same, for he is a minister _of God_ to thee for good.\" We are commanded to be \"subject for conscience' sake.\" Magistrates \"are God's ministers.\"--What could be plainer?--This is _religion_: not politics, but religion. Human government is \"ordained of God.\" Magistrates are \"ministers of God,\" to whom men are commanded to be \"subject for conscience' sake.\"  This, therefore, settles the principle, on which obedience to human government is the religious duty of men. There may be a point where that obedience may justly stop, (a matter which we shall consider soon;) but the great principle before us now is an important one, namely, that human government and Law are things which exist by the will of God, and men are bound to submit to them on that high ground. This is the general rule. This is a _religious_ duty; whatever exceptions we may be able to find sometimes, among the diversities of human Law and human condition under it,--or when human Law would interfere with the first class of our duties, which God does not allow it to do. \"The powers that be, are ordained of God.\"  Let it, therefore, be carefully noticed, that no man or body of men has any right to say, that they will be without government, without Law, or that religion has nothing to do with the question of their civil obedience to Law. Such obedience must _be a part_ of their religion, or they cannot be Christians. It is a part of the _will and ordinance_ of God.  Among politicians and statesmen, the idea of what they call \"the social compact\" is a very familiar idea, and sometimes figures largely. They mean by this, that there exists between the different members of every civilized and orderly community, a tacit \"compact\" or agreement, by which each individual tacitly or impliedly consents to surrender some of his natural rights into the hands of the community in general, or the hands of its government, in order to have the power of the community in general, or power of its government protect him in the enjoyment of others of his rights. Thus, they tell us, that each man receives a benefit from the power of society or government, which he could not secure by his individual power, and receives it in return for the individual natural rights, which he surrenders to the general society or government: so that, on the whole, this \"compact\" between him and the body politic is beneficial to him. For example, he might not be able to defend his farm from the violence of unjust men, who might deprive him of it; and so he procures the aid of civil government to defend it for him, and in return for this benefit he consents that his farm shall be taxed, and consents also to forego his personal right to defend it himself in any manner he could, and let the government defend it for him in their own way. So of all other civil provisions, rights and duties under the civil government. Politicians are accustomed to refer them all to \"the social compact.\"  I do not complain of this idea of a \"social compact,\" when the idea is presented merely as a justification of government, or as an _explanation_ of the propriety, necessity and equity of Law. But when it is presented as _the foundation_ on which civil government reposes, though it may satisfy a citizen, it ought not at all to satisfy a Christian. The truth is, there is no such \"social compact.\" The idea is only a fancy. Human government is not founded on any such \"social compact\" at all. It either exists by force, or it is founded on the will of God, in every case. Its _just_ foundation is the will of God. And when men are submitting to human government, they are not to consider themselves as merely carrying out the implied conditions of a \"social compact;\" but their duty is, to consider themselves as submitting to an _ordinance_ of their God and Maker. Human government is of a more high and sacred and solemn character, than the mere idea of a \"social compact\" would make it. God has something to do with it--much to do with it. His will is the solid foundation on which it rests, (even though at first it may have been established by force,) and every man is religiously bound to regulate his obedience or disobedience to human government on this divinely revealed principle. \"The social compact\" may be a very good idea to employ for convincing an infidel in respect to the right of Law; but it is too low and loose an idea for a Christian; it falls far below the truth, and below the just solemnity of obligation.  The _necessity_ of human Law results very much, if not entirely, from the injustice of mankind. In no age since the fall of Adam, has any considerable body of men been found so just and upright, that civil Law could be dispensed with. The bad would do injustice to the good, if it were not for Law, and those magistrates appointed by Law, who are \"a terror to evil doers.\" Conscience is not effective in the breast of every sinner, and therefore Law must come in, to hinder that injustice, which, without it, would not be hindered by individual conscience, and to compel that righteousness which, without it, individual conscience would fail to enforce. As individual conscience becomes more stringent, civil Law may become more lax. If men would be just towards one another of themselves, there would be no necessity of human Law, to compel them to abstain from injury and to perform their duties to one another.  Consequently, Law is a friend to the human race. It is the protector of the good man; and it punishes the bad man, only for the purpose of securing rights,--property, liberty and life. And even the bad would be worse off a thousand fold than they are, if there were no efficient Law to restrain them by its authority and sanctions.  The _importance_ of civil Law is vastly great. Its importance can scarcely be exaggerated by any representation. The most of our earthly happiness lies under the protection of human Law, and lies there by the will of God. We have not an item of property, in land, or houses, or goods, or chattels, or money, which the Law does not guard for us; and we have very little indeed, which we could effectually guard for ourselves. If this protecting, guarding Law is not enforced,--if the Law is obstructed, or crippled, or baffled, or violently set at naught; then, the security of civilized society is gone, and our property, our liberty, our rights, privileges and life, just lie at the mercy of every unjust man, and any violent and excited band of the wicked!--So important to us is the potential dominion and regular administration of Law.  Moreover our very rights in religion, our privilege to have the word of God and read it, to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience, to preach the gospel and hear it, are rights and privileges, which, in this unjust world, we could not enjoy for a single year, aside from the protection and potential administration of human government.  If this human government, the government of Law, cannot be maintained, therefore, there is nothing on earth valuable to us, which is secure for a single hour! If the Law cannot be enforced, then government is at an end and anarchy reigns, and all is confusion, uncertainty, and violence! Order, civilization, Christianity is not safe!  There is indeed a _limit_ to the obedience due to human government. Such government may become, and sometimes does become, so unjust, oppressive, tyrannical, and cruel, as not to answer the designed, and righteous, and beneficial purposes of government for a whole people; and in such a case, it deserves no respect as an ordinance of God, for it is then acting contrary to the will of God and the necessity of society; and the injured and oppressed people may justly rise in rebellion against such a government, and overthrow it, if they can. But, let it be carefully remembered, that any violent resistance is positive rebellion against the government; and either that resistance must be crushed, or the government must be overturned. There is no middle way--there can be none. In such a case the whole authority and power of the government come into direct hostility and conflict with the violence which resists the execution of Law; and government must crush that violence, or that violence must crush the government. A government is at an end, a nullity, when it cannot execute its laws. Let it be carefully remembered also, that violent resistance to Law cannot be justified, when there is no righteous design to overthrow the government itself; for no man owes a _half_-allegiance to government, or can commit a _half_-high-treason; and besides, Law is too important and delicate a thing to have its majesty trifled with, by the wicked nonsense of a _half_-obedience. Let it be carefully remembered also, that violent resistance to Law cannot be justified, when there is no fair prospect of overthrowing the government, and being able to establish a better one. To justify violent resistance to the laws, it is not enough that the government is unjust and its laws unrighteous; it is necessary also, that there should be no good ground to hope for a cessation of that unrighteousness in some peaceful way, and that there should be a prospect of some good to be gained by the resistance, which good shall be worth more than all the labor, and treasure, and strife, and blood, which the revolution shall cost. Let it be carefully remembered, too, that violent resistance on any one point is rebellion on every point, for \"he that offendeth in one point is guilty of all:\" such resistance is opposition by force to one entire government--is just a conflict with the powers that be; so that any resisting individual or number of "]]]
