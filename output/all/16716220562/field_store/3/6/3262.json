NEW YORK      1909       FOR ALL LITTLE FRIENDS      OF      MR. MCGREGOR & PETER & BENJAMIN  [Illustration]  It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"  _I_ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then _I_ am not a rabbit.  They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!  When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.  I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  As there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.  Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.  Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had \"shot\" into flower.  [Illustration]  The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.  Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.  The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.  (I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.  The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.  While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.  They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.  Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.  Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.  Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--  \"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.  He went to put away the mowing machine.  While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.  She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?  [Illustration]  Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.  Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.  But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.  [Illustration]  The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.  Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.  [Illustration]  Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.  [Illustration]  Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.  He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.  The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.  [Illustration]  They watched him go into his house.  And then they crept up to the window to listen.  [Illustration]  Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.  They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--  \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs. McGregor.  \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"  \"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"  \"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.  (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)  Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be _old_ rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.  \"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"  \"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!\"  \"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"  [Illustration]  Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.  When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"  [Illustration]  And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.  It was rather hurt.  [Illustration]  Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.  [Illustration]  So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.  [Illustration]  But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.

It is a land of rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River, from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.  Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the cañon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.  Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most of them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader in size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which, according to current stories, had, on several occasions, captured an antelope for the pack.  It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard, and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen, who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years, to exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.  The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the truth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate. Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that had been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt, it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet. It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.  These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared--that was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed, was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their immunity.  On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry of Old Lobo, and stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in a hollow, where they had 'rounded up' a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a line of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset of the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he left his position on the hill, and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was upon her. Seizing her by the neck he suddenly held back with all his force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned a somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part in the killing--after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, \"Now, why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much time?\"  The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he, having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had killed the animals themselves. But next morning, on going to look for his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that had been poisoned.  The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and each year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been hunted down for less. Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger named Tannerey came one day galloping up the cañon of the Currumpaw. He had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting--the best of guns and horses, and a pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Panhandle, he and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that, within a few days, old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddle-bow.  Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious. The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky cañons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these and by crossing it got rid of the horsemen. His band then scattered and thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point of course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves, no longer outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made two other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever"]]]
