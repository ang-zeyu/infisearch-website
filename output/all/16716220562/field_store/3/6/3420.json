Is it the _thought_ does all from time's first hour? \"In the beginning,\" read then, \"was the _power_.\" Yet even while I write it down, my finger Is checked, a voice forbids me there to linger. The spirit helps! At once I dare to read And write: \"In the beginning was the _deed_.\"  If I with thee must share my chamber, Poodle, now, remember, No more howling, No more growling! I had as lief a bull should bellow, As have for a chum such a noisy fellow. Stop that yell, now, One of us must quit this cell now! 'Tis hard to retract hospitality, But the door is open, thy way is free. But what ails the creature? Is this in the course of nature? Is it real? or one of Fancy's shows?  How long and broad my poodle grows! He rises from the ground; That is no longer the form of a hound! Heaven avert the curse from us! He looks like a hippopotamus, With his fiery eyes and the terrible white Of his grinning teeth! oh what a fright Have I brought with me into the house! Ah now, No mystery art thou! Methinks for such half hellish brood The key of Solomon were good.  _Spirits_ [_in the passage_]. Softly! a fellow is caught there!   Keep back, all of you, follow him not there!   Like the fox in the trap,   Mourns the old hell-lynx his mishap.   But give ye good heed!   This way hover, that way hover,   Over and over,   And he shall right soon be freed.   Help can you give him,   O do not leave him!   Many good turns he's done us,   Many a fortune won us.  _Faust_. First, to encounter the creature By the spell of the Four, says the teacher:     Salamander shall glisten,[12]     Undina lapse lightly,     Sylph vanish brightly,     Kobold quick listen.  He to whom Nature Shows not, as teacher, Every force And secret source, Over the spirits No power inherits.      Vanish in glowing     Flame, Salamander!     Inward, spirally flowing,     Gurgle, Undine!     Gleam in meteoric splendor,     Airy Queen!     Thy homely help render,     Incubus! Incubus!     Forth and end the charm for us!  No kingdom of Nature Resides in the creature. He lies there grinning--'tis clear, my charm Has done the monster no mite of harm. I'll try, for thy curing, Stronger adjuring.      Art thou a jail-bird,     A runaway hell-bird?     This sign,[13] then--adore it!     They tremble before it     All through the dark dwelling.  His hair is bristling--his body swelling.      Reprobate creature!     Canst read his nature?     The Uncreated,     Ineffably Holy,     With Deity mated,     Sin's victim lowly?  Driven behind the stove by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; He fills the whole room, so huge he's grown, He waxes shadowy faster and faster. Rise not up to the ceiling--down! Lay thyself at the feet of thy master! Thou seest, there's reason to dread my ire. I'll scorch thee with the holy fire! Wait not for the sight Of the thrice-glowing light! Wait not to feel the might Of the potentest spell in all my treasure!           MEPHISTOPHELES.     [_As the mist sinks, steps forth from behind the stove,     dressed as a travelling scholasticus_.] Why all this noise? What is your worship's pleasure?  _Faust_. This was the poodle's essence then! A travelling clark? Ha! ha! The casus is too funny.  _Mephistopheles_. I bow to the most learned among men! 'Faith you did sweat me without ceremony.  _Faust_. What is thy name?  _Mephistopheles_. The question seems too small For one who holds the _word_ so very cheaply, Who, far removed from shadows all, For substances alone seeks deeply.  _Faust_. With gentlemen like him in my presence, The name is apt to express the essence, Especially if, when you inquire, You find it God of flies,[14] Destroyer, Slanderer, Liar. Well now, who art thou then?  _Mephistopheles_. A portion of that power, Which wills the bad and works the good at every hour.  _Faust_. Beneath thy riddle-word what meaning lies?  _Mephistopheles_. I am the spirit that denies! And justly so; for all that time creates, He does well who annihilates! Better, it ne'er had had beginning; And so, then, all that you call sinning, Destruction,--all you pronounce ill-meant,-- Is my original element.  _Faust_. Thou call'st thyself a part, yet lookst complete to me.  _Mephistopheles_. I speak the modest truth to thee. A world of folly in one little soul, _Man_ loves to think himself a whole; Part of the part am I, which once was all, the Gloom That brought forth Light itself from out her mighty womb, The upstart proud, that now with mother Night Disputes her ancient rank and space and right, Yet never shall prevail, since, do whate'er he will, He cleaves, a slave, to bodies still; From bodies flows, makes bodies fair to sight; A body in his course can check him, His doom, I therefore hope, will soon o'ertake him, With bodies merged in nothingness and night.  _Faust_. Ah, now I see thy high vocation! In gross thou canst not harm creation, And so in small hast now begun.  _Mephistopheles_. And, truth to tell, e'en here, not much have done. That which at nothing the gauntlet has hurled, This, what's its name? this clumsy world, So far as I have undertaken, I have to own, remains unshaken By wave, storm, earthquake, fiery brand. Calm, after all, remain both sea and land. And the damn'd living fluff, of man and beast the brood, It laughs to scorn my utmost power. I've buried myriads by the hour, And still there circulates each hour a new, fresh blood. It were enough to drive one to distraction! Earth, water, air, in constant action, Through moist and dry, through warm and cold, Going forth in endless germination! Had I not claimed of fire a reservation, Not one thing I alone should hold.  _Faust_. Thus, with the ever-working power Of good dost thou in strife persist, And in vain malice, to this hour, Clenchest thy cold and devilish fist! Go try some other occupation, Singular son of Chaos, thou!  _Mephistopheles_. We'll give the thing consideration, When next we meet again! But now Might I for once, with leave retire?  _Faust_. Why thou shouldst ask I do not see. Now that I know thee, when desire Shall prompt thee, freely visit me. Window and door give free admission. At least there's left the chimney flue.  _Mephistopheles_. Let me confess there's one small prohibition  Lies on thy threshold, 'gainst my walking through, The wizard-foot--[15]  _Faust_.  Does that delay thee? The Pentagram disturbs thee? Now, Come tell me, son of hell, I pray thee, If that spell-binds thee, then how enteredst thou? _Thou_ shouldst proceed more circumspectly!  _Mephistopheles_. Mark well! the figure is not drawn correctly; One of the angles, 'tis the outer one, Is somewhat open, dost perceive it?  _Faust_. That was a lucky hit, believe it! And I have caught thee then? Well done! 'Twas wholly chance--I'm quite astounded!  _Mephistopheles_.  The _poodle_ took no heed, as through the door he bounded; The case looks differently now; The _devil_ can leave the house no-how.  _Faust_. The window offers free emission.  _Mephistopheles_. Devils and ghosts are bound by this condition:  The way they entered in, they must come out. Allow In the first clause we're free, yet not so in the second.  _Faust_. In hell itself, then, laws are reckoned? Now that I like; so then, one may, in fact, Conclude a binding compact with you gentry?  _Mephistopheles_. Whatever promise on our books finds entry, We strictly carry into act. But hereby hangs a grave condition, Of this we'll talk when next we meet; But for the present I entreat Most urgently your kind dismission.  _Faust_. Do stay but just one moment longer, then, Tell me good news and I'll release thee.  _Mephistopheles_. Let me go now! I'll soon come back again, Then may'st thou ask whate'er shall please thee.  _Faust_. I laid no snare for thee, old chap! Thou shouldst have watched and saved thy bacon. Who has the devil in his trap Must hold him fast, next time he'll not so soon be taken.  _Mephistopheles_. Well, if it please thee, I'm content to stay For company, on one condition, That I, for thy amusement, may To exercise my arts have free permission.  _Faust_. I gladly grant it, if they be Not disagreeable to me.  _Mephistopheles_. Thy senses, friend, in this one hour Shall grasp the world with clearer power Than in a year's monotony. The songs the tender spirits sing thee, The lovely images they bring thee Are not an idle magic play. Thou shalt enjoy the daintiest savor, Then feast thy taste on richest flavor, Then thy charmed heart shall melt away. Come, all are here, and all have been Well trained and practised, now begin!  _Spirits_. Vanish, ye gloomy     Vaulted abysses!     Tenderer, clearer,     Friendlier, nearer,     Ether, look through!     O that the darkling     Cloud-piles were riven!     Starlight is sparkling,     Purer is heaven,     Holier sunshine     Softens the blue.     Graces, adorning     Sons of the morning--     Shadowy wavings--     Float along over;     Yearnings and cravings     After them hover.     Garments ethereal,     Tresses aerial,     Float o'er the flowers,     Float o'er the bowers,     Where, with deep feeling,     Thoughtful and tender,     Lovers, embracing,     Life-vows are sealing.     Bowers on bowers!     Graceful and slender     Vines interlacing!     Purple and blushing,     Under the crushing     Wine-presses gushing,     Grape-blood, o'erflowing,     Down over gleaming     Precious stones streaming,     Leaves the bright glowing     Tops of the mountains,     Leaves the red fountains,     Widening and rushing,     Till it encloses     Green hills all flushing,     Laden with roses.     Happy ones, swarming,     Ply their swift pinions,     Glide through the charming     Airy dominions,     Sunward still fleering,     Onward, where peering     Far o'er the ocean,     Islets are dancing     With an entrancing,     Magical motion;     Hear them, in chorus,     Singing high o'er us;     Over the meadows     Flit the bright shadows;     Glad eyes are glancing,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],["title","Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#7)"],["body","feet dancing.     Up the high ridges     Some of them clamber,     Others are skimming     Sky-lakes of amber,     Others are swimming     Over the ocean;--     All are in motion,     Life-ward all yearning,     Longingly turning     To the far-burning     Star-light of bliss.  _Mephistopheles_. He sleeps! Ye airy, tender youths, your numbers Have sung him into sweetest slumbers! You put me greatly in your debt by this. Thou art not yet the man that shall hold fast the devil! Still cheat his senses with your magic revel, Drown him in dreams of endless youth; But this charm-mountain on the sill to level, I need, O rat, thy pointed tooth! Nor need I conjure long, they're near me, E'en now comes scampering one, who presently will hear me.  The sovereign lord of rats and mice, Of flies and frogs and bugs and lice, Commands thee to come forth this hour, And gnaw this threshold with great power, As he with oil the same shall smear-- Ha! with a skip e'en now thou'rt here! But brisk to work! The point by which I'm cowered, Is on the ledge, the farthest forward. Yet one more bite, the deed is done.-- Now, Faust, until we meet again, dream on!  _Faust_. [_Waking_.] Again has witchcraft triumphed o'er me? Was it a ghostly show, so soon withdrawn? I dream, the devil stands himself before me--wake, to find a poodle gone!         STUDY-CHAMBER.      FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES.   _Faust_. A knock? Walk in! Who comes again to tease me?  _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis I.  _Faust_. Come in!  _Mephistopheles_. Must say it thrice, to please me.  _Faust_. Come in then!  _Mephistopheles_. That I like to hear. We shall, I hope, bear with each other; For to dispel thy crotchets, brother, As a young lord, I now appear, In scarlet dress, trimmed with gold lacing, A stiff silk cloak with stylish facing, A tall cock's feather in my hat, A long, sharp rapier to defend me, And I advise thee, short and flat, In the same costume to attend me; If thou wouldst, unembarrassed, see What sort of thing this life may be.  _Faust_. In every dress I well may feel the sore Of this low earth-life's melancholy. I am too old to live for folly, Too young, to wish for nothing more. Am I content with all creation? Renounce! renounce! Renunciation-- Such is the everlasting song That in the ears of all men rings, Which every hour, our whole life long, With brazen accents hoarsely sings. With terror I behold each morning's light, With bitter tears my eyes are filling, To see the day that shall not in its flight Fulfil for me one wish, not one, but killing Every presentiment of zest With wayward skepticism, chases The fair creations from my breast With all life's thousand cold grimaces. And when at night I stretch me on my bed And darkness spreads its shadow o'er me; No rest comes then anigh my weary head, Wild dreams and spectres dance before me. The God who dwells within my soul Can heave its depths at any hour; Who holds o'er all my faculties control Has o'er the outer world no power; Existence lies a load upon my breast, Life is a curse and death a long'd-for rest.  _Mephistopheles_. And yet death never proves a wholly welcome guest.  _Faust_. O blest! for whom, when victory's joy fire blazes, Death round his brow the bloody laurel windeth, Whom, weary with the dance's mazes, He on a maiden's bosom findeth. O that, beneath the exalted spirit's power, I had expired, in rapture sinking!  _Mephistopheles_. And yet I knew one, in a midnight hour, Who a brown liquid shrank from drinking.  _Faust_. Eaves-dropping seems a favorite game with thee.  _Mephistopheles_. Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me.  _Faust_. Since that sweet tone, with fond appealing, Drew me from witchcraft's horrid maze, And woke the lingering childlike feeling With harmonies of happier days; My curse on all the mock-creations That weave their spell around the soul, And bind it with their incantations And orgies to this wretched hole! Accursed be the high opinion Hugged by the self-exalting mind! Accursed all the dream-dominion That makes the dazzled senses blind! Curs'd be each vision that befools us, Of fame, outlasting earthly life! Curs'd all that, as possession, rules us, As house and barn, as child and wife! Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure He fires our hearts for deeds of might, When, for a dream of idle pleasure, He makes our pillow smooth and light! Curs'd be the grape-vine's balsam-juices! On love's high grace my curses fall! On faith! On hope that man seduces, On patience last, not least, of all!  _Choir of spirits_. [_Invisible_.] Woe! Woe!     Thou hast ground it to dust,     The beautiful world,     With mighty fist;     To ruins 'tis hurled;     A demi-god's blow hath done it!     A moment we look upon it,     Then carry (sad duty!)     The fragments over into nothingness,     With tears unavailing     Bewailing     All the departed beauty.     Lordlier     Than all sons of men,     Proudlier     Build it again,     Build it up in thy breast anew!     A fresh career pursue,     Before thee     A clearer view,     And, from the Empyréan,     A new-born Paean     Shall greet thee, too!  _Mephistopheles_. Be pleased to admire     My juvenile choir!     Hear how they counsel in manly measure     Action and pleasure!     Out into life,     Its joy and strife,     Away from this lonely hole,     Where senses and soul     Rot in stagnation,     Calls thee their high invitation.  Give over toying with thy sorrow Which like a vulture feeds upon thy heart; Thou shalt, in the worst company, to-morrow Feel that with men a man thou art. Yet I do not exactly intend Among the canaille to plant thee. I'm none of your magnates, I grant thee; Yet if thou art willing, my friend, Through life to jog on beside me, Thy pleasure in all things shall guide me, To thee will I bind me, A friend thou shalt find me, And, e'en to the grave, Shalt make me thy servant, make me thy slave!  _Faust_. And in return what service shall I render?  _Mephistopheles_. There's ample grace--no hurry, not the least.  _Faust_. No, no, the devil is an egotist, And does not easily \"for God's sake\" tender That which a neighbor may assist. Speak plainly the conditions, come! 'Tis dangerous taking such a servant home.  _Mephistopheles_. I to thy service _here_ agree to bind me, To run and never rest at call of thee; When _over yonder_ thou shalt find me, Then thou shalt do as much for me.  _Faust_. I care not much what's over yonder: When thou hast knocked this world asunder, Come if it will the other may! Up from this earth my pleasures all are streaming, Down on my woes this earthly sun is beaming; Let me but end this fit of dreaming, Then come what will, I've nought to say. I'll hear no more of barren wonder If in that world they hate and love, And whether in that future yonder There's a Below and an Above.  _Mephistopheles._ In such a mood thou well mayst venture. Bind thyself to me, and by this indenture Thou shalt enjoy with relish keen Fruits of my arts that man had never seen.  _Faust_. And what hast thou to give, poor devil? Was e'er a human mind, upon its lofty level, Conceived of by the like of thee? Yet hast thou food that brings satiety, Not satisfaction; gold that reftlessly, Like quicksilver, melts down within The hands; a game in which men never win; A maid that, hanging on my breast, Ogles a neighbor with her wanton glances; Of fame the glorious godlike zest, That like a short-lived meteor dances-- Show me the fruit that, ere it's plucked, will rot, And trees from which new green is daily peeping!  _Mephistopheles_. Such a requirement scares me not; Such treasures have I in my keeping. Yet shall there also come a time, good friend, When we may feast on good things at our leisure.  _Faust_. If e'er I lie content upon a lounge of pleasure-- Then let there be of me an end! When thou with flattery canst cajole me, Till I self-satisfied shall be, When thou with pleasure canst befool me, Be that the last of days for me! I lay the wager!  _Mephistopheles_. Done!  _Faust_. And heartily! Whenever to the passing hour I cry: O stay! thou art so fair! To chain me down I give thee power To the black bottom of despair! Then let my knell no longer linger, Then from my service thou art free, Fall from the clock the index-finger, Be time all over, then, for me!  _Mephistopheles_. Think well, for we shall hold you to the letter.  _Faust_. Full right to that just now I gave; I spoke not as an idle braggart better. Henceforward I remain a slave, What care I who puts on the setter?  _Mephistopheles_. I shall this very day, at Doctor's-feast,[16] My bounden service duly pay thee. But one thing!--For insurance' sake, I pray thee, Grant me a line or two, at least.  _Faust_. Pedant! will writing gain thy faith, alone? In all thy life, no man, nor man's word hast thou known? Is't not enough that I the fatal word That passes on my future days have spoken? The world-stream raves and rushes (hast not heard?) And shall a promise hold, unbroken? Yet this delusion haunts the human breast, Who from his soul its roots would sever? Thrice happy in whose heart pure truth finds rest. No sacrifice shall he repent of ever! But from a formal, written, sealed attest, As from a spectre, all men shrink forever. The word and spirit die together, Killed by the sight of wax and leather. What wilt thou, evil sprite, from me? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, shall it be? Shall I subscribe with pencil, pen or graver? Among them all thy choice is free.  _Mephistopheles_. This rhetoric of thine to me Hath a somewhat bombastic savor. Any small scrap of paper's good. Thy signature will need a single drop of blood.[17]  _Faust_. If this will satisfy thy mood, I will consent thy whim to favor.  _Mephistopheles._ Quite a peculiar juice is blood.  _Faust_. Fear not that I shall break this bond; O, never! My promise, rightly understood, Fulfils my nature's whole endeavor. I've puffed myself too high, I see; To _thy_ rank only I belong. The Lord of Spirits"]]]
