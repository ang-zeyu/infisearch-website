By the time he reached home he had forgotten almost everything the famous doctor, Aunt Polly Woodchuck, had said to him. About all Mr. Crow could recall of their talk was that Aunt Polly had told him his swollen foot was caused by gout; and that she had given him samples of such food as he might eat, and also such as he mightn't.  He had put the two kinds in different pockets, just as Aunt Polly had suggested. And all he had to do when he was hungry was to look into his pockets and see what food he might safely choose for his meal. Well, Mr. Crow was hungry as a bear by the time he reached his house. And the first thing he did was to feel in his left-hand pocket. He drew forth a kernel of corn.  \"Good!\" he cried. \"That's exactly what I'd like for my dinner. And if Farmer Green hadn't tarred his corn before planting it I know exactly where I'd go.\" Then he thought deeply for a few minutes. \"I'll go over to the corn-crib and see if I can't find some corn on the ground!\" he exclaimed a little later. While he was thinking he ate the sample of corn, without once noticing what he did.  So Mr. Crow flew swiftly to the farm-yard. It happened that there was nobody about. And, luckily, Mr. Crow found enough corn scattered near the door of the corn-crib to furnish him with a good dinner.  The next morning, as soon as it began to grow light (for Mr. Crow was an early riser), he felt in his left-hand pocket once more. And he pulled out an elderberry.  \"That won't do!\" he said. \"It's too early in the season for elderberries.\" But he ate the sample--though he found it rather dry, for it was a last year's berry. And then he fished a bird's egg out of the same pocket. \"My favorite breakfast!\" he remarked. He ate the egg. And at once he started out to hunt for more. Some people say that he robbed the nests of several small birds before he had breakfast enough.  Mr. Crow then proceeded to pass the morning very pleasantly, by making calls on his friends. He enjoyed their surprise at seeing his bandaged foot.  \"I've the worst case of gout Aunt Polly Woodchuck has ever seen,\" he told every one with an air of pride.  When lunch time came, it found Mr. Crow with a hearty appetite. And once more he felt in his left-hand pocket to see what he might have for his meal.  He pulled out a squirming field-mouse. Mr. Crow was about to eat him; but the mouse slipped away and hid in a hollow stump. So Mr. Crow lost him. Then he went soaring off across the pasture. And when he came home again he didn't seem hungry at all. Whatever he may have found to eat, it seemed to satisfy him.  By this time Mr. Crow had quite recovered from the fear that had seized him when he first discovered his swollen foot. And before he went to sleep that night he thought he would take the bandage off his foot and look at it. He had some trouble in removing the bandage. And when he had succeeded in unwinding it he could hardly believe his eyes. His foot was its natural size again!  Old Mr. Crow looked at the bandage. And he saw, clinging to it, a mass of caked mud. He could not understand that.  \"Anyhow, I'm cured,\" he said sadly. He was disappointed, because there were still a good many of his friends to whom he had not yet shown his bandaged foot. \"I don't consider that Aunt Polly Woodchuck is as good a doctor as people say,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. \"Here she's gone and cured my foot almost a week before I wanted her to!\"  And the next day he went over to see the old lady and complain about her mistake.  \"What have you been eating?\" she asked Mr. Crow.  He told her.  \"Ah!\" said Aunt Polly. \"It's your mistake--and not mine. You ate what was in your _left-hand pocket_, instead of what was in the right-hand one. If you had followed my instructions everything would have been all right.\"  Old Mr. Crow felt very much ashamed. There was nothing he could say. So he slunk away and moped for three days.  Though he did not know it, the trouble with his foot was simply this: He had daubed so much tar on his foot, in Farmer Green's cornfield, that the soft earth had stuck to it in a big ball.  Mr. Crow recovered his spirits at last. And neither he nor Aunt Polly Woodchuck ever discovered that he never had gout at all. He forgave her, at last, for having cured his foot too quickly, for the affair gave him something to talk about for a long time afterward. He never tired of telling his friends about the trouble he had had.  But many of the feathered folk in Pleasant Valley grew very weary of the tale before they heard the last of it.     VIII  THE NEW UMBRELLA   Old Mr. Crow was feeling very happy, because he had a new umbrella--the only umbrella that was owned for miles around. And wherever Mr. Crow went, the umbrella went too, tucked snugly under his wing.  There was only one thing that could have made Mr. Crow feel any happier; and that was rain. As soon as it rained he intended to spread the umbrella over his head and go to call upon all of his friends.  But not a drop of rain had fallen for weeks. And so far as old Mr. Crow could judge, there wasn't a single sign of a storm anywhere. Nevertheless, he continued to carry his umbrella every time he stirred away from his house. And although the weather was so dry, he found a good deal of pleasure in showing his umbrella to his neighbors.  Now, old Mr. Crow had a cousin of whom you have heard. His name was Jasper Jay; and he was a great dandy. He always took pride in his handsome blue suit, of which he was very vain.  Being an inquisitive fellow, Jasper Jay was much interested in Mr. Crow's umbrella. Whenever he met Mr. Crow he asked the old gentleman to spread the umbrella; and once Mr. Crow had let Jasper hold it for as long as ten seconds, \"just to see how it felt.\"  After that Jasper Jay could not get the umbrella out of his mind. He began calling at Mr. Crow's house every day; and all the time he was there he never took his eyes off the umbrella.  At last the two cousins met in the woods one day. As usual, Mr. Crow had his umbrella tucked under his wing. But when Jasper asked him to spread it, Mr. Crow refused.  \"I can't keep putting my umbrella up and down,\" he said. \"If I did, the first thing I knew it would be worn out; and then what would happen to me if it should rain?\"  \"You'd get wet,\" said Jasper Jay.  \"Exactly!\" Mr. Crow replied. \"And at my age I might take cold and be very ill, perhaps.\"  \"Where are you going?\" Jasper inquired pleasantly. He was disappointed; but he did not let his cousin see that.  \"I'm on my way to a big meeting of the Crow family,\" the old gentleman replied.  \"And you're taking your umbrella?\" Jasper asked, as if he were greatly astonished.  \"Why--yes!\" Mr. Crow answered. \"You seem surprised.\"  \"I am,\" said Jasper Jay with a sad shake of his head. \"I'd hate to risk it, if I were you. There'll be some rough young fellows there and you're likely to lose your umbrella. I'm afraid they'll take it away from you.\"  Old Mr. Crow looked worried.  \"I don't know what to do,\" he said anxiously. \"It's an important meeting. They're expecting me. And I'm late, as it is. If I go back home and leave my umbrella I'm afraid they'll think I'm not coming.\"  \"I suppose I could help you just this once,\" Jasper Jay remarked. \"Of course, it's not a thing I'd do for everybody. But since you're my cousin, if you want me to do it I'll take care of your umbrella until you come back again.\"  \"Will you wait right here?\" Mr. Crow asked him.  \"Yes!\"  \"Will you promise not to spread the umbrella?\"  At that question Jasper Jay's face fell. But pretty soon he said cheerfully:  \"I promise not to put it up--unless it should rain.\"  Mr. Crow looked carefully at the sky. There was not a cloud to be seen. So he turned to Jasper Jay with a smile and placed the umbrella carefully in his hands.  Then Mr. Crow flew away.  \"It certainly can't rain,\" he said to himself.  Mr. Crow arrived at the meeting quite out of breath. And his friends noticed that he seemed uneasy about something. He kept looking up at the sky and asking everybody what he thought about the weather.     IX  CAUGHT IN THE RAIN   Left alone in the woods with Mr. Crow's umbrella, Jasper Jay had a fine time. First he looked at the umbrella very closely, from the handle to the slender tip. Then he placed it under his wing and strutted back and forth upon the ground, just as he had seen Mr. Crow parade before his friends. And Jasper wished that someone would come along and see him.  But nobody came. So after a while he grew tired of wishing. And the next thing he did was to unfasten the strap that kept the folds of the umbrella wrapped about its stick.  \"I'm not putting it up,\" he told himself. \"I didn't promise I wouldn't do this. I only agreed not to spread the umbrella unless it rained.\"  Just then a low rumble caught his ear.  \"That's thunder!\" he cried. \"I do hope it will rain!\"  In a short time the sky grew dark. And pretty soon great drops came pattering down upon the leaves over Jasper's head.  \"Hurrah!\" he shouted. And then he flew straight up to the very top of a tall tree, where he perched himself on a limb and spread Mr. Crow's umbrella.  Though it was soon raining hard, the rain did not fall any too heavily to please Jasper Jay. He enjoyed the pleasant-sounding patter over his head. And he liked to watch the trickle of the water as it ran off the umbrella and fell upon the leaves beneath him.  Now, while Jasper Jay was having a good time, there was one person who was not enjoying the shower at all--and that was old Mr. Crow. You remember that he had gone to a crows' meeting. And as soon as it began to sprinkle the meeting broke up. Old Mr. Crow was the first one to leave; and he was in a great hurry. He wished he had not left his umbrella with Jasper Jay, for he did not want anybody but himself to use it--especially for the first time. As you know, ever since Mr. Crow had owned his umbrella it had not rained once."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14402"],["title","The Tale of Old Mr. Crow (#3)"],["body","  That was why the old gentleman flew away without even stopping to bid his friends good-by. He flew as fast as he could, through the pelting rain. And he had just come in sight of the woods where Jasper had promised to wait for him when the rain suddenly stopped.  As Mr. Crow dropped downward he saw something in a tree-top that made him very angry. It was his umbrella, wide open. And beneath it--though Mr. Crow could not see him--was Jasper Jay.  He was trembling with rage--was Mr. Crow--as he alighted on a limb near his cousin.  \"Here, you!\" the old gentleman cried. \"Put down my umbrella! It's not raining. How dare you sit there with my umbrella spread over your head?\"  Jasper Jay closed the umbrella quickly and handed it to Mr. Crow with a smile.  \"That's a good umbrella,\" he remarked. \"As you see, I'm not even damp. But you--ha! ha!--_you_ seem to have been caught out in a heavy shower.\"  Mr. Crow was dripping. His tail feathers looked quite bedraggled. And he was shaking the drops off his wings.  \"It will never happen again,\" Mr. Crow said hoarsely. \"Never again will I go anywhere, rain or shine, without my umbrella. At my age it's very dangerous to get so wet.\"  \"I'd advise you to run through the woods, and then run back again, until you get warm,\" Jasper Jay suggested. \"And since you're my cousin, if you want me to do it I'll help you--and hold your umbrella for you until you return.\"  But Mr. Crow shook his head.  \"I've had enough of your advice,\" he said sourly. \"It might rain again; and then I'd be worse off than ever.\"  Jasper Jay pretended to be surprised. And he, too, began to tremble and shake. But it was only because he was laughing silently at his cousin.     X  A QUEER TOADSTOOL   Mr. Crow did exactly as he said he would. After the time he was caught out in the shower and got wet he never went even the shortest distance away from home without his umbrella. And he wouldn't even let anybody take his umbrella, in order to look at it.  \"It might rain suddenly,\" Mr. Crow explained. \"I might be soaked before I knew it--and you know that's very dangerous for one of my age.\"  It was not many days before there was another thunder-shower. And this time Mr. Crow was ready for it. As soon as he felt the first drops he spread his umbrella and raised it above his head. At last he was very, very happy. For the first time in his life he was going to see what it was like to stay out in the rain without getting wet.  Now, it hadn't rained long before Jasper Jay came hurrying up to Mr. Crow, where he sat on Farmer Green's fence, and crawled under the umbrella close beside the old gentleman.  \"You don't mind, I hope?\" said Jasper Jay.  \"Well--n-no!\" said Mr. Crow. \"It's a big umbrella, fortunately. But I hope no one else comes along.\"  The words were hardly out of his bill when Mr. Crow noticed a slim, gray fellow, with a bushy tail, bounding toward them on top of the fence.  It was Frisky Squirrel. And he crept close to Mr. Crow, under the umbrella, saying:  \"You don't mind, I hope?\"  \"N-no!\" replied Mr. Crow. With Frisky on one side of him and Jasper Jay on the other Mr. Crow thought that maybe he could keep drier because they were there. But he hoped no one else would pass that way.  Well, some one did. Before Mr. Crow knew what had happened, a voice said--right over his shoulder:  \"You don't mind, I hope?\"  It was Fatty Coon! And Mr. Crow certainly did mind--though he didn't dare say so. In the first place, Mr. Crow was afraid of Fatty Coon. And in the second place, Fatty was so big that he crowded Mr. Crow almost off the fence.  Old Mr. Crow found it very hard to hold the umbrella straight and cling to the fence-rail at the same time. And something seemed to have made the umbrella very heavy. In spite of all he could do, it would tilt. And Mr. Crow crouched under the edge of it, right where the rain poured off. The water dripped inside his collar and ran down his back until he was soaked through and through.  Pretty soon Mr. Crow began to sneeze. At first he sneezed quite softly. But every time it happened he sneezed harder than the time before. And at last he sneezed so violently that he lost his hold on the fence and went tumbling down to the ground, with the umbrella, Jasper Jay, Fatty Coon and Frisky Squirrel on top of him.  As they fell, a huge, long-legged fellow named Christopher Crane alighted on the fence, on the very spot where they had been sitting, and laughed loudly at them.  \"What's the joke?\" Mr. Crow asked in an angry voice, as he picked himself up. \"I don't see anything to laugh at.\"  \"Joke?\" said Christopher Crane. \"The joke's on me. I thought that thing you have in your hand was a new kind of toadstool, growing on the fence. And here I've been sitting on it all this time and never knew you chaps were under it!\"  At that, everybody except Mr. Crow began to laugh, too. But Mr. Crow coughed; and his voice was hoarser than, ever as he said to Christopher Crane:  \"I'm wet as I can be. And I've caught a terrible cold. You're a water-bird; and you don't mind a wetting. But for one of my age it's very dangerous.\"  Then he started homeward. Though it was still raining, he tucked his umbrella under his wing, for he was afraid those rude fellows would crowd under it again.  And before he had reached his house Mr. Crow had made up his mind about something.     XI  MR. CROW'S PLAN   Yes! Old Mr. Crow had made up his mind about something. After Jasper Jay and Frisky Squirrel and Fatty Coon had come and crouched under his umbrella, and Christopher Crane had perched himself on top of it, and Mr. Crow had fallen off the fence, the old gentleman decided that he would take no more chances. The next time it rained he knew exactly what he was going to do.  He said nothing to anyone about his plan. It was a good one--Mr. Crow was sure of that. And he could hardly wait for the next shower, he was so eager to give his scheme a trial. He hoped that there would be a big storm--not merely a quick shower, which would be over before he had had time to enjoy it.  At last the storm came. And for once Mr. Crow was not disappointed. It was the sort of storm that is worth waiting for. The wind had blown hard all day. And the sky had grown almost as black as night. And old Mr. Crow was watching in his house, with his umbrella grasped tight in his hands, waiting for the rain.  When the rain began, it did not fall in a gentle patter. It came with a rush and a roar, driven in white sheets before a mighty wind.  \"This is great!\" Mr. Crow cried aloud, as he stepped upon a limb outside his house and spread his umbrella.  Now, this is what he had decided to do: He had determined that the very next time it rained he would take his umbrella and fly up into the sky, where he would not be annoyed by anybody coming along to share his shelter with him.  For a moment Mr. Crow balanced himself on the limb. And the next moment, he had jumped. Afterward, he could never remember exactly how it all happened. Everything seemed like a bad dream to old Mr. Crow--such as he sometimes had after eating too heartily of corn.  He felt himself swept up into the sky faster than he had flown for years. He was pitched and tossed about; and in no time at all he was drenched with water--for the cold rain pelted him as much as it pleased. He could only cling to the handle of his umbrella. And so he sailed away, swaying this way and that as the wind caught him, and always climbing higher and higher into the sky.  He passed the top of Blue Mountain almost before he knew it. Looking down, he could see Mrs. Eagle on her nest; and she seemed to be in a flutter of excitement, too. She was frightened; and it was no wonder. For she thought the umbrella was a monstrous bird, coming to snatch her children away from her.  In a few minutes more Mr. Crow had crossed another mountain. He was sailing away from home like a kite that has broken its string. And he was rising so high in the air that he was beginning to grow uneasy. He began to wonder what he had better do.  Of course, there was one thing he didn't have to worry about--and that was _falling_. But he did want to go home.  You might suppose that he would have done that long before. But the trouble was, he didn't want to lose his umbrella. He thought a great deal of it; and he didn't know where he could get another. (You must not forget that it was the only umbrella in Pleasant Valley.)  Old Mr. Crow had a hard time deciding just what to do. First, he thought he would let go of the umbrella. Then he thought he wouldn't. Next, he thought he would. And after that he thought he wouldn't, again.  Perhaps he would still be changing his mind like that if something hadn't happened. Anyhow, all at once the umbrella turned inside out. And Mr. Crow began to fall.  But he didn't fall far. For as soon as he realized what was going on he let go of his umbrella-handle, spread his wings, and soared down to the ground.  He made no attempt to find his way home until the next day, but spent the night in an evergreen grove. And he didn't feel as badly about losing his umbrella as you would have thought, for he said that ever since he had owned it he had caught a wetting when it rained. And since that was the case, he was better off without an umbrella, anyhow.     XII  A RACE WITH THE TRAIN   Old Mr. Crow was fond of gay clothes. Perhaps it was because he was so black that he always chose bright colors. Anyhow, so long as he could wear a bright red coat and a yellow necktie--or a bright red necktie and a yellow coat--he was generally quite happy.  All his neighbors knew who he was as far as they could see him. No matter if they caught only a flash of yellow or of red, they were pretty safe in saying, \"There goes old Mr. Crow!\"  Well, it happened that during the summers that he spent in Pleasant Valley Mr. Crow sometimes went on excursions.  \"It's so dull here!\" he would often say. \"I like to see things _happen_, once in a while.\" "]]]
