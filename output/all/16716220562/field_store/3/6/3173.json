'Apollo and the Mouse' suggests hypothetically, as a possible explanation of the tie between the God and the Beast, that Apollo-worship superseded, but did not eradicate, Totemism.  The suggestion is little more than a conjecture.  'Star Myths' points out that Greek myths of stars are a survival from the savage stage of fancy in which such stories are natural.  'Moly and Mandragora' is a study of the Greek, the modern, and the Hottentot folklore of magical herbs, with a criticism of a scholarly and philological hypothesis, according to which Moly is the dog-star, and Circe the moon.  'The Kalevala' is an account of the Finnish national poem; of all poems that in which the popular, as opposed to the artistic, spirit is strongest.  The Kalevala is thus a link between Marchen and Volkslieder on one side, and epic poetry on the other.  'The Divining Rod' is a study of a European and civilised superstition, which is singular in its comparative lack of copious savage analogues.  'Hottentot Mythology' is a criticism of the philological method, applied to savage myth.  'Fetichism and the Infinite,' is a review of Mr. Max Muller's theory that a sense of the Infinite is the germ of religion, and that Fetichism is secondary, and a corruption.  This essay also contains a defence of the _evidence_ on which the anthropological method relies.  The remaining essays are studies of the 'History of the Family,' and of 'Savage Art.'  The essay on 'Savage Art' is reprinted, by the kind permission of Messrs. Cassell & Co., from two numbers (April and May, 1882) of the Magazine of Art.  I have to thank the editors and publishers of the Contemporary Review, the Cornhill Magazine, and Fraser's Magazine, for leave to republish 'The Early History of the Family,' 'The Divining Rod,' and 'Star Myths,' and 'The Kalevala.'  A few sentences in 'The Bull-Roarer,' and 'Hottentot Mythology,' appeared in essays in the Saturday Review, and some lines of 'The Method of Folklore' in the Guardian.  To the editors of those journals also I owe thanks for their courteous permission to make this use of my old articles.  To Mr. E. B. Tylor and Mr. W. R. S. Ralston I must express my gratitude for the kindness with which they have always helped me in all difficulties.  I must apologise for the controversial matter in the volume.  Controversy is always a thing to be avoided, but, in this particular case, when a system opposed to the prevalent method has to be advocated, controversy is unavoidable.  My respect for the learning of my distinguished adversaries is none the less great because I am not convinced by their logic, and because my doubts are excited by their differences.  Perhaps, it should be added, that these essays are, so to speak, only flint-flakes from a neolithic workshop.  This little book merely skirmishes (to change the metaphor) in front of a much more methodical attempt to vindicate the anthropological interpretation of myths.  But lack of leisure and other causes make it probable that my 'Key to All Mythologies' will go the way of Mr. Casaubon's treatise.     THE METHOD OF FOLKLORE.   After the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed the soil, it sometimes happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped piece of metal or a few triangular flints in a field or near a road.  There was no such piece of metal, there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the finder is puzzled about the origin of the objects on which he has lighted.  He carries them home, and the village wisdom determines that the wedge-shaped piece of metal is a 'thunderbolt,' or that the bits of flint are 'elf-shots,' the heads of fairy arrows.  Such things are still treasured in remote nooks of England, and the 'thunderbolt' is applied to cure certain maladies by its touch.  As for the fairy arrows, we know that even in ancient Etruria they were looked on as magical, for we sometimes see their points set, as amulets, in the gold of Etruscan necklaces.  In Perugia the arrowheads are still sold as charms.  All educated people, of course, have long been aware that the metal wedge is a celt, or ancient bronze axe-head, and that it was not fairies, but the forgotten peoples of this island who used the arrows with the tips of flint.  Thunder is only so far connected with them that the heavy rains loosen the surface soil, and lay bare its long hidden secrets.  There is a science, Archaeology, which collects and compares the material relics of old races, the axes and arrow-heads.  There is a form of study, Folklore, which collects and compares the similar but immaterial relics of old races, the surviving superstitions and stories, the ideas which are in our time but not of it.  Properly speaking, folklore is only concerned with the legends, customs, beliefs, of the Folk, of the people, of the classes which have least been altered by education, which have shared least in progress.  But the student of folklore soon finds that these unprogressive classes retain many of the beliefs and ways of savages, just as the Hebridean people use spindle-whorls of stone, and bake clay pots without the aid of the wheel, like modern South Sea Islanders, or like their own prehistoric ancestors. {11a}  The student of folklore is thus led to examine the usages, myths, and ideas of savages, which are still retained, in rude enough shape, by the European peasantry.  Lastly, he observes that a few similar customs and ideas survive in the most conservative elements of the life of educated peoples, in ritual, ceremonial, and religious traditions and myths. Though such remains are rare in England, we may note the custom of leading the dead soldier's horse behind his master to the grave, a relic of days when the horse would have been sacrificed. {11b}  We may observe the persistence of the ceremony by which the monarch, at his coronation, takes his seat on the sacred stone of Scone, probably an ancient fetich stone.  Not to speak, here, of our own religious traditions, the old vein of savage rite and belief is found very near the surface of ancient Greek religion.  It needs but some stress of circumstance, something answering to the storm shower that reveals the flint arrow-heads, to bring savage ritual to the surface of classical religion.  In sore need, a human victim was only too likely to be demanded; while a feast-day, or a mystery, set the Greeks dancing serpent-dances or bear-dances like Red Indians, or swimming with sacred pigs, or leaping about in imitation of wolves, or holding a dog-feast, and offering dog's flesh to the gods. {12}  Thus the student of folklore soon finds that he must enlarge his field, and examine, not only popular European story and practice, but savage ways and ideas, and the myths and usages of the educated classes in civilised races.  In this extended sense the term 'folklore' will frequently be used in the following essays.  The idea of the writer is that mythology cannot fruitfully be studied apart from folklore, while some knowledge of anthropology is required in both sciences.  The science of Folklore, if we may call it a science, finds everywhere, close to the surface of civilised life, the remains of ideas as old as the stone elf-shots, older than the celt of bronze.  In proverbs and riddles, and nursery tales and superstitions, we detect the relics of a stage of thought, which is dying out in Europe, but which still exists in many parts of the world.  Now, just as the flint arrow-heads are scattered everywhere, in all the continents and isles, and everywhere are much alike, and bear no very definite marks of the special influence of race, so it is with the habits and legends investigated by the student of folklore.  The stone arrow-head buried in a Scottish cairn is like those which were interred with Algonquin chiefs.  The flints found in Egyptian soil, or beside the tumulus on the plain of Marathon, nearly resemble the stones which tip the reed arrow of the modern Samoyed.  Perhaps only a skilled experience could discern, in a heap of such arrow-heads, the specimens which are found in America or Africa from those which are unearthed in Europe.  Even in the products of more advanced industry, we see early pottery, for example, so closely alike everywhere that, in the British Museum, Mexican vases have, ere now, been mixed up on the same shelf with archaic vessels from Greece.  In the same way, if a superstition or a riddle were offered to a student of folklore, he would have much difficulty in guessing its _provenance_, and naming the race from which it was brought.  Suppose you tell a folklorist that, in a certain country, when anyone sneezes, people say 'Good luck to you,' the student cannot say a priori what country you refer to, what race you have in your thoughts.  It may be Florida, as Florida was when first discovered; it may be Zululand, or West Africa, or ancient Rome, or Homeric Greece, or Palestine.  In all these, and many other regions, the sneeze was welcomed as an auspicious omen.  The little superstition is as widely distributed as the flint arrow-heads.  Just as the object and use of the arrow-heads became intelligible when we found similar weapons in actual use among savages, so the salutation to the sneezer becomes intelligible when we learn that the savage has a good reason for it.  He thinks the sneeze expels an evil spirit.  Proverbs, again, and riddles are as universally scattered, and the Wolufs puzzle over the same devinettes as the Scotch schoolboy or the Breton peasant.  Thus, for instance, the Wolufs of Senegal ask each other, 'What flies for ever, and rests never?'--Answer, 'The Wind.'  'Who are the comrades that always fight, and never hurt each other?'--'The Teeth.'  In France, as we read in the 'Recueil de Calembours,' the people ask, 'What runs faster than a horse, crosses water, and is not wet?'--Answer, 'The Sun.'  The Samoans put the riddle, 'A man who stands between two ravenous fishes?'--Ans"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14080"],["title","Custom and Myth (#2)"],["body","wer, 'The tongue between the teeth.'  Again, 'There are twenty brothers, each with a hat on his head?'--Answer, 'Fingers and toes, with nails for hats.'  This is like the French 'un pere a douze fils?'--'l'an.'  A comparison of M. Rolland's 'Devinettes' with the Woluf conundrums of Boilat, the Samoan examples in Turner's' Samoa,' and the Scotch enigmas collected by Chambers, will show the identity of peasant and savage humour.  A few examples, less generally known, may be given to prove that the beliefs of folklore are not peculiar to any one race or stock of men.  The first case is remarkable: it occurs in Mexico and Ceylon--nor are we aware that it is found elsewhere.  In Macmillan's Magazine {15} is published a paper by Mrs. Edwards, called 'The Mystery of the Pezazi.' The events described in this narrative occurred on August 28, 1876, in a bungalow some thirty miles from Badiella.  The narrator occupied a new house on an estate called Allagalla.  Her native servants soon asserted that the place was haunted by a Pezazi.  The English visitors saw and heard nothing extraordinary till a certain night: an abridged account of what happened then may be given in the words of Mrs. Edwards:--     Wrapped in dreams, I lay on the night in question tranquilly sleeping,    but gradually roused to a perception that discordant sounds disturbed    the serenity of my slumber.  Loth to stir, I still dozed on, the    sounds, however, becoming, as it seemed, more determined to make    themselves heard; and I awoke to the consciousness that they proceeded    from a belt of adjacent jungle, and resembled the noise that would be    produced by some person felling timber.     Shutting my ears to the disturbance, I made no sign, until, with an    expression of impatience, E--- suddenly started up, when I laid a    detaining grasp upon his arm, murmuring that there was no need to    think of rising at present--it must be quite early, and the kitchen    cooly was doubtless cutting fire-wood in good time.  E--- responded,    in a tone of slight contempt, that no one could be cutting fire-wood    at that hour, and the sounds were more suggestive of felling jungle;    and he then inquired how long I had been listening to them.  Now    thoroughly aroused, I replied that I had heard the sounds for some    time, at first confusing them with my dreams, but soon sufficiently    awakening to the fact that they were no mere phantoms of my    imagination, but a reality.  During our conversation the noises became    more distinct and loud; blow after blow resounded, as of the axe    descending upon the tree, followed by the crash of the falling timber.    Renewed blows announced the repetition of the operations on another    tree, and continued till several were devastated.  It is unnecessary to tell more of the tale.  In spite of minute examinations and close search, no solution of the mystery of the noises, on this or any other occasion, was ever found.  The natives, of course, attributed the disturbance to the Pezazi, or goblin.  No one, perhaps, has asserted that the Aztecs were connected by ties of race with the people of Ceylon.  Yet, when the Spaniards conquered Mexico, and when Sahagun (one of the earliest missionaries) collected the legends of the people, he found them, like the Cingalese, strong believers in the mystic tree-felling.  We translate Sahagun's account of the 'midnight axe':--     When so any man heareth the sound of strokes in the night, as if one    were felling trees, he reckons it an evil boding.  And this sound they    call youaltepuztli (youalli, night; and tepuztli, copper), which    signifies 'the midnight hatchet.'  This noise cometh about the time of    the first sleep, when all men slumber soundly, and the night is still.    The sound of strokes smitten was first noted by the temple-servants,    called tlamacazque, at the hour when they go in the night to make    their offering of reeds or of boughs of pine, for so was their custom,    and this penance they did on the neighbouring hills, and that when the    night was far spent.  Whenever they heard such a sound as one makes    when he splits wood with an axe (a noise that may be heard afar off),    they drew thence an omen of evil, and were afraid, and said that the    sounds were part of the witchery of Tezeatlipoca, that often thus    dismayeth men who journey in the night.  Now, when tidings of these    things came to a certain brave man, one exercised in war, he drew    near, being guided by the sound, till he came to the very cause of the    hubbub.  And when he came upon it, with difficulty he caught it, for    the thing was hard to catch: natheless at last he overtook that which    ran before him; and behold, it was a man without a heart, and, on    either side of the chest, two holes that opened and shut, and so made    the noise.  Then the man put his hand within the breast of the figure    and grasped the breast and shook it hard, demanding some grace or    gift.  As a rule, the grace demanded was power to make captives in war.  The curious coincidence of the 'midnight axe,' occurring in lands so remote as Ceylon and Mexico, and the singular attestation by an English lady of the actual existence of the disturbance, makes this youaltepuztli one of the quaintest things in the province of the folklorist.  But, whatever the cause of the noise, or of the beliefs connected with the noise, may be, no one would explain them as the result of community of _race_ between Cingalese and Aztecs.  Nor would this explanation be offered to account for the Aztec and English belief that the creaking of furniture is an omen of death in a house.  Obviously, these opinions are the expression of a common state of superstitious fancy, not the signs of an original community of origin.  Let us take another piece of folklore.  All North-country English folk know the Kernababy.  The custom of the 'Kernababy' is commonly observed in England, or, at all events, in Scotland, where the writer has seen many a kernababy.  The last gleanings of the last field are bound up in a rude imitation of the human shape, and dressed in some tag-rags of finery.  The usage has fallen into the conservative hands of children, but of old 'the Maiden' was a regular image of the harvest goddess, which, with a sickle and sheaves in her arms, attended by a crowd of reapers, and accompanied with music, followed the last carts home to the farm. {18}  It is odd enough that the 'Maiden' should exactly translate [Greek], the old Sicilian name of the daughter of Demeter.  'The Maiden' has dwindled, then, among us to the rudimentary kernababy; but ancient Peru had her own Maiden, her Harvest Goddess.  Here it is easy to trace the natural idea at the basis of the superstitious practice which links the shores of the Pacific with our own northern coast.  Just as a portion of the yule-log and of the Christmas bread were kept all the year through, a kind of nest-egg of plenteous food and fire, so the kernababy, English or Peruvian, is an earnest that corn will not fail all through the year, till next harvest comes.  For this reason the kernababy used to be treasured from autumn's end to autumn's end, though now it commonly disappears very soon after the harvest home.  It is thus that Acosta describes, in Grimston's old translation (1604), the Peruvian kernababy and the Peruvian harvest home:--     This feast is made comming from the chacra or farme unto the house,    saying certaine songs, and praying that the Mays (maize) may long    continue, the which they call Mama cora.  What a chance this word offers to etymologists of the old school: how promptly they would recognise, in mama mother--[Greek], and in cora--[Greek], the Mother and the Maiden, the feast of Demeter and Persephone!  However, the days of that old school of antiquarianism are numbered.  To return to the Peruvian harvest home:--     They take a certaine portion of the most fruitefull of the Mays that    growes in their farmes, the which they put in a certaine granary which    they do calle Pirua, with certaine ceremonies, watching three nightes;    they put this Mays in the richest garments they have, and, being thus    wrapped and dressed, they worship this Pirua, and hold it in great    veneration, saying it is the Mother of the Mays of their inheritances,    and that by this means the Mays augments and is preserved.  In this    moneth they make a particular sacrifice, and the witches demand of    this Pirua, 'if it hath strength sufficient to continue until the next    yeare,' and if it answers 'no,' then they carry this Mays to the farme    to burne, whence they brought it, according to every man's power, then    they make another Pirua, with the same ceremonies, saying that they    renue it, to the ende that the seede of the Mays may not perish.  The idea that the maize can speak need not surprise us; the Mexican held much the same belief, according to Sahagun:--     It was thought that if some grains of maize fell on the ground, he who    saw them lying there was bound to lift them, wherein, if he failed, he    harmed the maize, which plained itself of him to God, saying, 'Lord,    punish this man, who saw me fallen and raised me not again; punish him    with famine, that he may learn not to hold me in dishonour.'  Well, in all this affair of the Scotch kernababy, and the Peruvian Mama cora, we need no explanation beyond the common simple ideas of human nature.  We are not obliged to hold, either that the Peruvians and Scotch are akin by blood, nor that, at some forgotten time, they met each other, and borrowed each other's superstitions.  Again, when we find Odysseus sacrificing a black sheep to the dead, {20} and when we read that the Ovahereroes in South Africa also appease with a black sheep the spirits of the departed, we do not feel it necessary to hint that the Ovahereroes are of Greek descent, or have borrowed their ritual from the"]]]
