The wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of December 7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba, and it may be wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous conflict had for seven years wasted the neighboring island. During all those years an utter disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of humanity, which called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom, continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that productive region, enormously affecting the commerce of all commercial nations, but that of the United States more than any other by reason of proximity and larger trade and intercourse. At that juncture General Grant uttered these words, which now, as then, sum up the elements of the problem:    A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,   impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself   is that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the   contest.    In a former message to Congress[3] I had occasion to consider this   question, and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba,   dreadful and devastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the   fearful dignity of war. * * * It is possible that the acts of foreign   powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of this very nature, might be   pointed to in defense of such recognition. But now, as in its past   history, the United States should carefully avoid the false lights   which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of questionable   propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule, which has been   its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and of good   report. The question of according or of withholding rights of   belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particular   attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and   justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration   of moral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is   required, when the interests and rights of another government or of   its people are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to   require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto. But   this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of   international law as war. Belligerence, too, is a fact. The mere   existence of contending armed bodies and their occasional conflicts do   not constitute war in the sense referred to. Applying to the existing   condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publicists and   writers on international law, and which have been observed by nations   of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive or selfish and   unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of   such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and   manifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary   functions of government toward its own people and to other states,   with courts for the administration of justice, with a local   habitation, possessing such organization of force, such material, such   occupation of territory, as to take the contest out of the category of   a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it   on the terrible footing of war, to which a recognition of belligerency   would aim to elevate it. The contest, moreover, is solely on land; the   insurrection has not possessed itself of a single seaport whence it   may send forth its flag, nor has it any means of communication with   foreign powers except through the military lines of its adversaries.   No apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complications   which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels,   both commercial and national, and upon the consular officers of other   powers calls for the definition of their relations to the parties to   the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard the   accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature   as I regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right.   Such recognition entails upon the country according the rights which   flow from it difficult and complicated duties, and requires the   exaction from the contending parties of the strict observance of their   rights and obligations. It confers the right of search upon the high   seas by vessels of both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms   and munitions of war, which now may be transported freely and without   interruption in the vessels of the United States, to detention and to   possible seizure; it would give rise to countless vexatious questions,   would release the parent Government from responsibility for acts done   by the insurgents, and would invest Spain with the right to exercise   the supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on   the high seas, a very large part of which, in its traffic between the   Atlantic and the Gulf States and between all of them and the States on   the Pacific, passes through the waters which wash the shores of Cuba.   The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead, if not to   abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful relations   of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such   supervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy   of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by   measures of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection.   Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations appear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked recognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the assumption of international neutrality. Such recognition, without more, will not confer upon either party to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actually possessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of neutrality, which recites the _de facto_ condition of belligerency as its motive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality in the declaring state. It assumes the international obligations of a neutral in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorous obligations at their own peril and can not expect to be shielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty law must under international law be admitted as a legitimate consequence of a proclamation of belligerency. While according the equal belligerent rights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors would be imposed on both, which, while nominally equal, would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba, her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military investment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorial waters, and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans within their own domain could not hope to create a parallel, while its creation through aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now, with the additional obligations of international neutrality we would perforce assume.  The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable by our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States no jurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United States no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within the paramount authority of Spain according to the international code of war.  For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the Executive will take it.  Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and has not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But should such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful change has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to the declaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of reform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare for one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans to the \"horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing in misery;\" that reforms must be instituted in accordance with the needs and circumstances of the time, and that these reforms, while designed to give full autonomy to the colony and to create a virtual entity and self-controlled administration, shall yet conserve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and burdens upon a basis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency.  The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a broad clemency is proffered.

The power of the Spanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuits and productive industries. That past methods are futile to force a peace by subjugation is freely admitted, and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency.  Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been promulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but as furnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil and electoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing constitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. A scheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective upon ratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which, with the insular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects affecting local order and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as to matters of state, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor-General acts by his own authority as the delegate of the central Government. This parliament receives the oath of the Governor-General to preserve faithfully the liberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the colonial secretaries are responsible. It has the right to propose to the central Government, through the Governor-General, modifications of the national charter and to invite new projects of law or executive measures in the interest of the colony.  Besides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoral registration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors and the manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of justice with native judges from members of the local bar; third, to frame the insular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without limitation of any kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban share of the national budget, which latter will be voted by the national Cortes with the assistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to initiate or take part in the negotiations of the national Government for commercial treaties which may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept or reject commercial treaties which the national Government may have concluded without the participation of the Cuban government; sixth, to frame the colonial tariff, acting in accord with the peninsular Government in scheduling articles of mutual commerce between the mother country and the colonies. Before introducing or voting upon a bill the Cuban government or the chambers will lay the project before the central Government and hear its opinion thereon, all the correspondence in such regard being made public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdiction arising between the different municipal, provincial, and insular assemblies, or between the latter and the insular executive power, and which from their nature may not be referable to the central Government for decision, shall be submitted to the courts.  That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which recession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in the few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its professions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should impatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken. It is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose brutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She has modified the horrible order of concentration and has undertaken to care for the helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their fields to do so, and assures them of the protection of the Spanish Government in their lawful occupations. She has just released the _Competitor_ prisoners, heretofore sentenced to death, and who have been the subject of repeated diplomatic correspondence during both this and the preceding Administration.  Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that time comes, that action will be determined in the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and honor, and to humanity.  Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world.         *       *       *       *       *  WILLIAM McKINLEY.   JOINT RESOLUTION appropriating $50,000 for the relief of destitute citizens of the United States in the island of Cuba.  _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That the sum of $50,000 be, and the same is hereby, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the relief of destitute citizens of the United States in the island of Cuba, said money to be expended at the discretion and under the direction of the President of the United States in the purchase and furnishing of food, clothing, and medicines to such citizens, and for transporting to the United States such of them as so desire and who are without means to transport themselves.  Approved, May 24, 1897.  [Footnote 1: See p. 127.]  [Footnote 2: See p. 136.]  [Footnote 3: See Vol. VII, pp. 64-69.]     SPECIAL MESSAGES.  EXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 28, 1898._  _To the Congress of the United States_:  For some time prior to the visit of the _Maine_ to Havana Harbor our consular representatives pointed out the advantages to flow from the visit of national ships to the Cuban waters, in accustoming the people to the presence of our flag as the symbol of good will and of our ships in the fulfillment of the mission of protection to American interests, even though no immediate need therefor might exist.  Accordingly, on the 24th of January last, after conference with the Spanish minister, in which the renewal of visits of our war vessels to Spanish waters was discussed and accepted, the peninsular authorities at Madrid and Havana were advised of the purpose of this Government to resume friendly naval visits at Cuban ports, and that in that view the _Maine_ would forthwith call at the port of Havana.  This announcement was received by the Spanish Government with appreciation of the friendly character of the visit of the _Maine_ and with notification of intention to return the courtesy by sending Spanish ships to the principal ports of the United States. Meanwhile the _Maine_ entered the port of Havana on the 25th of January, her arrival being marked with no special incident besides the exchange of customary salutes and ceremonial visits.  The _Maine_ continued in the harbor of Havana during the three weeks following her arrival. No appreciable excitement attended her stay. On the contrary, a feeling of relief and confidence followed the resumption of the long-interrupted friendly intercourse. So noticeable was this immediate effect of her visit that the consul-general strongly urged that the presence of our ships in Cuban waters should be kept up by retaining the _Maine_ at Havana, or, in the event of her recall, by sending another vessel there to take her place.  At forty minutes past 9 in the evening of the 15th of February the _Maine_ was destroyed by an explosion, by which the entire forward part of the ship was utterly wrecked. In this catastrophe 2 officers and 264 of her crew perished, those who were not killed outright by her explosion being penned between decks by the tangle of wreckage and drowned by the immediate sinking of the hull.  Prompt assistance was rendered by the neighboring vessels anchored in the harbor, aid being especially given by the boats of the Spanish cruiser _Alfonso XII_ and the Ward Line steamer _City of Washington_, which lay not far distant. The wounded were generously cared for by the authorities of Havana, the hospitals being freely opened to them, while the earliest recovered bodies of the dead were interred by the municipality in a public cemetery in the city. Tributes of grief and sympathy were offered from all official quarters of the island.  The appalling calamity fell upon the people of our country with crushing force, and for a brief time an intense excitement prevailed, which in a community less just and self-controlled than ours might have led to hasty acts of blind resentment. This spirit, however, soon gave way to the calmer processes of reason and to the resolve to investigate the facts and await material proof before forming a judgment as to the cause, the responsibility, and, if the facts warranted, the remedy due. This course necessarily recommended itself"]]]
