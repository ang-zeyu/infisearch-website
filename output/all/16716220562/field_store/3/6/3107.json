So complete and strong was the      evidence in her favor, that, after an eight days' trial, the      claimants abandoned the case, and a verdict was rendered for      the freedom of Rachel, and also of her sister, Elizabeth      Parker, who had been previously kidnapped, and conveyed to      New Orleans.  --> McCreary was demanded by Gov. Bigler, of Pennsylvania, to be delivered up for trial on a charge of kidnapping; but Gov. Lowe, of Maryland, refused to surrender him. See _Standard_, July 2, 1853.       JAMES TASKER, _New York City_, (Feb. 1852,) arrested through      the treachery of Police Officer Martin, and brought before      United States Commissioner George W. Morton, as the slave of      Jonathan Pinckney, of Maryland. He was given up, and taken      back to slavery.       HORACE PRESTON, arrested in _Williamsburg, New York_, as the      slave of William Reese, of Baltimore, Maryland;--Richard      Busteed, of New York, being Attorney for the slaveholder. He      was brought before United States Commissioner Morton, 1st      April, 1852; for several days previous he had been kept a      prisoner, and his wife knew not what had become of him. He      was given up by the Commissioner, and was carried into      slavery. The same policeman, Martin, (who acted in the case      of James Tasker,) was active in this case; being, doubtless,      the original informant.       Preston was afterwards bought for about $1,200, and brought      back.       _Columbia, Penn._, (end of March, 1852;) a colored man, named      WILLIAM SMITH, was arrested as a fugitive slave in the      lumber yard of Mr. Gottlieb, by Deputy Marshal Snyder, of      Harrisburg, and police officer Ridgeley, of Baltimore, under      a warrant from Commissioner McAllister. Smith endeavored to      escape, when Ridgeley drew a pistol and shot him dead!      Ridgeley was demanded by the Governor of Pennsylvania, of the      Governor of Maryland, and the demand was referred to the      Maryland Legislature.       Hon. J.R. Giddings proposed the erection of a monument to      Smith.       JAMES PHILLIPS, who had resided in _Harrisburg, Penn._, for      fourteen years, was arrested May 24, 1852, as the former      slave of Dennis Hudson, of Culpepper County, Virginia,      afterwards bought by Henry T. Fant, of Fauquier County. He      was brought before United States Commissioner McAllister.      Judge McKinney volunteered his services to defend the alleged      fugitive. The Commissioner, as soon as possible, ordered the      man to be delivered up; and, after fourteen years' liberty,      he was taken back to slavery in Virginia. Afterwards, bought      for $900, and taken back to Harrisburg.       _Wilkesbarre, Penn._, (Summer of 1852.) Mr. Harvey arrested      and fined for shielding a slave.       _Sacramento, California_; a man named Lathrop claimed another      as his slave, and Judge Fry decided that the claim was good,      and ordered the slave to be surrendered. Mr. Lathrop left,      with his slave, for the Atlantic States.       _A beautiful young woman_, nearly white, was pursued by her      owner [and father] to New York, (end of June, 1852.) There a      large reward was offered to a police officer to discover her,      place of residence. It was discovered, and measures taken for      her apprehension; but the alarm had been taken, and she      escaped.       _Sacramento, California_; three men were seized by a Mr.      Perkins, of Mississippi. The Court decided them to be his      property and they were carried back to Mississippi.--_Standard_,      July 29, 1852.       _Petersburg, Penn._ Two fugitives from Alabama slavery were      overtaken, and taken back, September, 1852.       JOHN HENRY WILSON, a lad of fourteen years, kidnapped from      Danville, Pennsylvania, and taken to Baltimore, where he was,      offered for sale to John N. Denning. Kidnappers committed to      jail, October, 1852.  [--> DANIEL WEBSTER, the endorser of the Fugitive Slave Law, died at Marshfield, Mass., October 24th, 1852, in the very height of the Law's triumphant operation.]       _LOUISA_, a colored woman, claimed by Mrs. Reese, of San      Francisco, California, was seized by five armed men, and put      on board Steamer Golden Gate, and carried it is not known      whither. The aid of the Law was not invoked. The California      _Christian Advocate_, from which the above is taken, says,      \"Two colored men, stewards on the Golden Gate, were sent back      to the States on the last trip under the State Fugitive Law.\"       _A mulatto woman, in San Francisco_, was ordered to be      delivered to her claimant, T.T. Smith, Jackson Country,      Missouri, by \"Justice Shepherd,\"--_San Francisco Herald_--in      _Standard_, November 4, 1852.       _Sandusky, Ohio._ Two men, two women, and several children      were arrested and taken from a steamboat just about to leave      for Detroit. Taken before Mayor Follett, by a man who claimed      to be their owner. R.R. Sloane, Esq., was employed as counsel      for the slaves. No one claiming custody of the slaves, or      producing any writs or warrants, Mr. Sloane signified to the      crowd present that there appeared to be no cause for the      detention of the persons. Immediately a rush was made for the      door. A man, who before had been silent, exclaimed, \"Here are      the papers--I own the slaves--I'll hold you individually      responsible for their escape.\" The slaves escaped into      Canada, October, 1852. Mr. Sloane was afterwards prosecuted      for the value of the slaves, and judgment given against him      to the amount of $3,950.       _Thirty slaves_, says the _Maysville_ (Ky.) _Eagle_, \"escaped      from Mason and Bracken Counties, a short time ago. Some of      them were captured in Ohio, by their owners, at a distance of      about forty miles from the river.\" \"They brought the captured      slaves home without encountering the least obstacle, or even      an unkind word.\"--_Standard_, November 4, 1852.       THE LEMMON SLAVES. At New York, eight persons, claimed by      Jonathan Lemmon, of Norfolk, Virginia, as his slaves, were      brought before Judge Paine, November, 1852. It appeared that      they had been brought to New York by their owner, with a view      of taking them to Texas, as his slaves. Mr. Louis Napoleon, a      respectable colored man, of New York, procured a writ of      habeas corpus, under which they were brought before the      court. Their liberation was called for, under the State Law,      not being fugitives, but brought into a free State by their      owner. Said owner appeared, with Henry D. Lapaugh as his      counsel, aided by Mr. Clinton. At their urgent request, the      case was postponed from time to time, when Judge Paine, with      evident reluctance, decreed the freedom of the slaves. E.D.      Culver and John Jay, Esqs., were counsel for the slaves. The      merchants and others of New York subscribed and paid Mr.      Lemmon the sum of $5,280, for loss of his slaves. The New      York _Journal of Commerce_ was very active in raising this      money. The same men were invited to contribute something for      the destitute men, women, and children claimed by Lemmon. The      whole amount given by them all, was two dollars. About one      thousand dollars were raised for them among the better      disposed but less wealthy class.       THOMAS BROWN alias GEORGE BORDLEY, _Philadelphia, November,      1852_, was claimed by one Andrew Pearce, Cecil County,      Maryland. Given up to claimant by Commissioner Ingraham. The      arrest of the man was made by the notorious kidnapper, George      F. Alberti. Mr. Pettit, counsel for the claimant.  [Transcriber's note: The following note is inserted after the following section but does not refer to any specific reported incident.]  --> The Slaveholders of Kentucky begin forming associations for mutual protection against loss of runaway slaves. The preamble of the plan of association proposed at a meeting at Minerva Kentucky, held in the winter of 1852-53, is as follows:--\"Whereas it has become absolutely necessary for the slave-owners of Kentucky to take such steps as will secure their property, we, the citizens of Mass. and Bracken counties, do recommend,\" &c. [end note]       RICHARD NEAL, free colored man, kidnapped in Philadelphia and      carried from the city in a carriage towards Maryland. A writ      of _habeas corpus_ was obtained, the kidnappers were      overtaken, and Neal brought back after resistance and various      hindrances. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania discharged him.      February, 1853.       _Ten slaves_, arrested in Indiana, and taken back to      Tennessee, by W. Carney and others. Resistance was      made, and W. Carney \"was very badly injured during the      fracas.\"--_Nashville ----_, March 5, 1853.

After being lodged in jail in St. Louis he      made his escape, and again went into Illinois. He was      pursued, found, and taken back to St. Louis.--_St. Louis      Republican_, March, 1853.       AMANDA, a slave girl, was brought to St. Louis, from near      Memphis, Tennessee, a year before, by a son of her master,      and by him set free, without his father's consent. After the      father's death, an attempt was made to seize Amanda, and take      her back to Tennessee without trial. This was prevented by      officers, the girl taken from the steamboat Cornelia, and      brought before Levi Davis, United States Commissioner. He      decided in favor of the claimants, (the heirs of the estate,      of course.)--_St. Louis"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13990"],["title","The Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims (#5)"],["body","epublican_, March 17, 1853.       JANE TRAINER, a colored child, about ten years old, in the      possession of Mrs. Rose Cooper, _alias_ Porter, (a woman      admitted by her counsel to be a common prostitute,) was      brought before Judge Duer, of New York City, by a writ of      _habeas corpus_, which had been applied for by Charles      Trainer, the father of the child, (a free colored man, who      had followed the parties from Mobile to New York,) and who      desired that the custody of his daughter's person should be      granted to him. [June, 1853, and previous.] Judge Duer      decided that it was not within his jurisdiction to determine      to whom the custody of the child belonged; the Supreme Court      of New York must decide that. Judge D. proposed to both      parties that the child should be put into his hands, and he      would provide a proper person for her care and education, but      the woman (Porter) would not consent to this. She evidently      designed to train up the child for a life of shame, and      perhaps of slavery also. The case was brought by a writ of      _habeas corpus_, before Judge Barculo, of the Supreme Court,      sitting at Brooklyn. The effort to serve the writ was at      first defeated by the notorious New York bully, Captain      Isaiah Rynders, acting, it was said, under the advice of      James T. Brady, counsel for Mrs. Porter. For this      interference with, the law, Rynders and some others were      arrested and taken before Judge Barculo, who let them off on      their making an apology! The second attempt to serve the writ      on the child was more successful. After hearing counsel,      Judge Barculo adjudged \"that the said Charles Trainer is      entitled to the care and custody of said Jane Trainer, and      directing her to be delivered to him as her father,\" &c. In      giving his decision, Judge B. said, \"It is not to be assumed      that a child under fourteen years of age is possessed of      sufficient discretion to choose her own guardian; a house of      ill-fame is not a suitable place, nor one of its inmates a      proper person for the education of such a child.\" Jane      Trainer's mother was afterwards bought from slavery in      Mobile, Alabama, and enabled to join her husband and child.       In 1854, Charles Trainer obtained a verdict in King's County      Court, New York, for $775 damages, against Rose Cooper.  [N.B. Though not strictly a case under the Fugitive Slave Law, this is very properly inserted here, as the whole spirit of the woman, of her counsel, and of the means he took to accomplish his base designs, was clearly instigated by that Law, and by the malignant influences it brought into action against the colored people, both slave and free.]       BASIL WHITE, Philadelphia, was summarily surrendered into      slavery in Maryland, by United States Commissioner Ingraham,      June 1, 1853. He was betrayed into the clutches of the      kidnapper Alberti, by a colored man named John Dorsey.       _Two slaves_ of Sylvester Singleton, living near Burlington,      (Ky.?) escaped and reached Columbus, Ohio; were there      overtaken by their master, who secured them and took them      back with him.--_Cincinnati Enquirer_.       JOHN FREEMAN, a free colored man, seized in Indianapolis, and      claimed as the slave of Pleasant Ellington, a Methodist      church-member, (Summer, 1853,) of Missouri. Freeman pledged      himself to prove that he was not the person he was alleged to      be. The United States Marshal consented to his having time      for this, provided he would go to jail, and pay _three      dollars a day_ for a guard to keep him secure! Bonds to any      amount, to secure the marshal against loss, if Freeman could      go at large, were rejected. Freeman's counsel went to      Georgia, and \"after many days returned with a venerable and      highly respectable gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Patillo,      (post-master of the place where he resides,) who had      voluntarily made the long journey for the sole purpose of      testifying to his knowledge of Freeman, and that he was well      known to be free!\" But Freeman was still kept in jail. After      several days, Ellington brought witnessess to prove F. to be      his slave. The witnesses, and Liston (counsel for Ellington)      wished to have Freeman strip himself, to be examined naked.      By advise of his counsel he refused. The marshal took him to      his cell, and compelled him to strip. The witnesses then      swore that he was Ellington's property. Freeman's counsel      produced further evidence that he had been known as a free      man _twenty_ years. Ellington claimed that he had escaped      from him _sixteen_ years before. The man who did escape from      Ellington, just sixteen years before, was discovered to be      living near Malden, Canada. Two of the Kentucky witnesses      visited and recognized him. Freeman was then released, but      with a large debt upon him, $1,200, which had grown up by      the unusually heavy expenses of his defence and long      imprisonment, Freeman brought a suit against Ellington for      false imprisonment laying damages at $10,000. A verdict for      $2,000 was given in his favor, which was agreed to by      Ellington's counsel.--_Indiana Free Democrat_, May, 1854.       _Three slaves_, two men and a girl, fled from near Maysville,      Kentucky, into Ohio. Were pursued by their owners and      assistants, five men armed, and were overtaken, says the      Maysville _Weekly Express_, \"at the bridge over Rattlesnake      Creek, on the Petersburg and Greenfield road, about ten      o'clock at night,\" the slaves being, armed, and accompanied      by a white man. Both parties fired, the negro girl was      wounded, but still fled; one of the negro men was also      wounded, and, says the Maysville paper, they \"were tracked a      mile and a half by the blood.\" The other slave was secured      and taken back to Kentucky, \"much bruised and cut in the      affray.\" \"The white man,\" says the same paper, \"was also      caught and beaten in a very severe manner with a club, and      strong hopes are entertained that he will die.\"--_Wilmington      (Ohio) Republican_, July, 22, 1853.       _A colored girl_, between four and five years old, suddenly      disappeared from Providence, R.I., July 13, 1853; at the same      time, a mulatto woman, who had been heard to make inquiries      about the child, was missing also. Believed to be a case of      kidnapping.       _A negro boy_, says the Memphis _Inquirer_, \"left his owner      in this city,\" and went on board the steamboat Aurilla Wood,      bound for Cincinnati. By a telegraphic message he was      intercepted, taken from the boat at Cairo, Illinois, and      taken back to Memphis. (Summer, 1853.)       GEORGE W. MCQUERRY, _Cincinnati, Ohio_. A colored man, who      had resided three or four years in Ohio, and married a free      woman, by whom he had three children, was remanded to slavery      by Judge McLean (August, 1853.) The man was taken by the      United States Marshal, with a posse, across the river to      Covington, Kentucky, and there delivered to his _master_!       _Two men kidnapped_ from Chicago, and taken to St. Louis. See      _Chicago_ Tribune, quoted in _Standard_, Aug. 27, 1853.       _Three Slaves_ taken by _Habeas Corpus_, from steamboat      Tropic, and brought before Judge Flinn, at Cincinnati,      August, 1853. The woman Hannah expressed a wish to return to      her master in the boat. Judge Flinn ordered her into the      custody of the claimants without investigation. Judge F.      asked Hannah if she had the custody of the child Susan, to      which she answered that she had. Whereupon the Judge also      ordered her back into the custody of the claimants, without      examination. Mr. Jolliffe protested against ordering the      child back without examination. The Court said they would      take the responsibility. The examination then proceeded in      the case of the man Edward. It appeared that they were      purchased in Virginia, to be conveyed to Mississippi. The      boat stopped at Cincinnati, and the slaves were twice taken      by the agent of the owners on shore, and upon the territory      of Ohio. Mr. Jolliffe commenced his argument at 7, P.M., and      argued that the slaves, being brought by their owners upon      free territory, were legally free. Mr. J., before finishing,      was taken ill, and obliged to leave the court-room; he first      begged the Court to adjourn until morning, which was refused      by Judge Flinn. Judge Keys said the Ohio river was a highway      for all States bordering on it, whose citizens had a right      also to use the adjacent shores for purposes necessary to      navigation. Mr. Zinn stated that Mr. Jolliffe had been      obliged to retire, in consequence of illness, and had      requested him to urge the Court to continue the case. Judge      Flinn said--\"The case will he decided to-night; that is      decided on. We have not been silting here four or five hours      to determine whether we will decide the case or not. It will      be decided, and you may come up to it sideways or square; or      any way you please; you must come to it.\" Mr. Zinn said he      was not going to argue. He had made the request out of      courtesy to a professional brother. He doubted the power of      the Court to deliver the boy into slavery. Judge Flinn      said--\"I do not wish to hear any arguments of that nature.\"      The man was then ordered to be taken by the Sheriff, and      delivered to claimant on board the boat,--which was      done.--_Cincinnati Gazette_, 27th August, 1853.
