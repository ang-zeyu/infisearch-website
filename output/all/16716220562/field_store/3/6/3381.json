I must pray for him, I must pray!”  Then he thought--“Where am I going to?” and he prayed desperately.  “Ah! this is not right at all,” little Em said, peeping between the stones, and finding him in a very curious posture. “What are you doing Waldo? It is not the play, you know. You should run out when we come to the white stone. Ah, you do not play nicely.”  “I--I will play nicely now,” said the boy, coming out and standing sheepishly before them; “I--I only forgot; I will play now.”  “He has been to sleep,” said freckled Em.  “No,” said beautiful little Lyndall, looking curiously at him: “he has been crying.”  She never made a mistake.  *****   The Confession.  One night, two years after, the boy sat alone on the kopje. He had crept softly from his father’s room and come there. He often did, because, when he prayed or cried aloud, his father might awake and hear him; and none knew his great sorrow, and none knew his grief, but he himself, and he buried them deep in his heart.  He turned up the brim of his great hat and looked at the moon, but most at the leaves of the prickly pear that grew just before him. They glinted, and glinted, and glinted, just like his own heart--cold, so hard, and very wicked. His physical heart had pain also; it seemed full of little bits of glass, that hurt. He had sat there for half an hour, and he dared not go back to the close house.  He felt horribly lonely. There was not one thing so wicked as he in all the world, and he knew it. He folded his arms and began to cry--not aloud; he sobbed without making any sound, and his tears left scorched marks where they fell. He could not pray; he had prayed night and day for so many months; and tonight he could not pray. When he left off crying, he held his aching head with his brown hands. If one might have gone up to him and touched him kindly; poor, ugly little thing! Perhaps his heart was almost broken.  With his swollen eyes he sat there on a flat stone at the very top of the kopje; and the tree, with every one of its wicked leaves, blinked, and blinked, and blinked at him. Presently he began to cry again, and then stopped his crying to look at it. He was quiet for a long while, then he knelt up slowly and bent forward. There was a secret he had carried in his heart for a year. He had not dared to look at it; he had not whispered it to himself, but for a year he had carried it. “I hate God!” he said. The wind took the words and ran away with them, among the stones, and through the leaves of the prickly pear. He thought it died away half down the kopje. He had told it now!  “I love Jesus Christ, but I hate God.”  The wind carried away that sound as it had done the first. Then he got up and buttoned his old coat about him. He knew he was certainly lost now; he did not care. If half the world were to be lost, why not he too? He would not pray for mercy any more. Better so--better to know certainly. It was ended now. Better so.  He began scrambling down the sides of the kopje to go home.  Better so! But oh, the loneliness, the agonized pain! for that night, and for nights on nights to come! The anguish that sleeps all day on the heart like a heavy worm, and wakes up at night to feed!  There are some of us who in after years say to Fate, “Now deal us your hardest blow, give us what you will; but let us never again suffer as we suffered when we were children.”  The barb in the arrow of childhood’s suffering is this: its intense loneliness, its intense agony.     Chapter 1.II. Plans and Bushman Paintings.  At last came the year of the great drought, the year of eighteen-sixty-two. From end to end of the land the earth cried for water. Man and beast turned their eyes to the pitiless sky, that like the roof of some brazen oven arched overhead. On the farm, day after day, month after month, the water in the dams fell lower and lower; the sheep died in the fields; the cattle, scarcely able to crawl, tottered as they moved from spot to spot in search of food. Week after week, month after month, the sun looked down from the cloudless sky, till the karoo-bushes were leafless sticks, broken into the earth, and the earth itself was naked and bare; and only the milk-bushes, like old hags, pointed their shrivelled fingers heavenward, praying for the rain that never came.  *****  It was on an afternoon of a long day in that thirsty summer, that on the side of the kopje furthest from the homestead the two girls sat. They were somewhat grown since the days when they played hide-and-seek there, but they were mere children still.  Their dress was of dark, coarse stuff; their common blue pinafores reached to their ankles, and on their feet they wore home-made velschoen.  They sat under a shelving rock, on the surface of which were still visible some old Bushman paintings, their red and black pigments having been preserved through long years from wind and rain by the overhanging ledge; grotesque oxen, elephants, rhinoceroses, and a one-horned beast, such as no man ever has seen or ever shall.  The girls sat with their backs to the paintings. In their laps were a few fern and ice-plant leaves, which by dint of much searching they had gathered under the rocks.  Em took off her big brown kapje and began vigorously to fan her red face with it; but her companion bent low over the leaves in her lap, and at last took up an ice-plant leaf and fastened it on to the front of her blue pinafore with a pin.  “Diamonds must look as these drops do,” she said, carefully bending over the leaf, and crushing one crystal drop with her delicate little nail. “When I,” she said, “am grown up, I shall wear real diamonds, exactly like these in my hair.”  Her companion opened her eyes and wrinkled her low forehead.  “Where will you find them, Lyndall? The stones are only crystals that we picked up yesterday. Old Otto says so.”  “And you think that I am going to stay here always?”  The lip trembled scornfully.  “Ah, no,” said her companion. “I suppose some day we shall go somewhere; but now we are only twelve, and we cannot marry till we are seventeen. Four years, five--that is a long time to wait. And we might not have diamonds if we did marry.”  “And you think that I am going to stay here till then?”  “Well, where are you going?” asked her companion.  The girl crushed an ice-plant leaf between her fingers.  “Tant Sannie is a miserable old woman,” she said. “Your father married her when he was dying, because he thought she would take better care of the farm, and of us, than an English woman. He said we should be taught and sent to school. Now she saves every farthing for herself, buys us not even one old book. She does not ill-use us--why? Because she is afraid of your father’s ghost. Only this morning she told her Hottentot that she would have beaten you for breaking the plate, but that three nights ago she heard a rustling and a grunting behind the pantry door, and knew it was your father coming to spook her. She is a miserable old woman,” said the girl, throwing the leaf from her; “but I intend to go to school.”  “And if she won’t let you?”  “I shall make her.”  “How?”  The child took not the slightest notice of the last question, and folded her small arms across her knees.  “But why do you want to go, Lyndall?”  “There is nothing helps in this world,” said the child slowly, “but to be very wise, and to know everything--to be clever.”  “But I should not like to go to school!” persisted the small freckled face.  “And you do not need to. When you are seventeen this Boer-woman will go; you will have this farm and everything that is upon it for your own; but I,” said Lyndall, “will have nothing. I must learn.”  “Oh, Lyndall! I will give you some of my sheep,” said Em, with a sudden burst of pitying generosity.  “I do not want your sheep,” said the girl slowly; “I want things of my own. When I am grown up,” she added, the flush on her delicate features deepening at every word, “there will be nothing that I do not know. I shall be rich, very rich; and I shall wear not only for best, but every day, a pure white silk, and little rose-buds, like the lady in Tant Sannie’s bedroom, and my petticoats will be embroidered, not only at the bottom, but all through.”  The lady in Tant Sannie’s bedroom was a gorgeous creature from a fashion-sheet, which the Boer-woman, somewhere obtaining, had pasted up at the foot of her bed, to be profoundly admired by the children.  “It would be very nice,” said Em; but it seemed a dream of quite too transcendent a glory ever to be realized.  At this instant there appeared at the foot of the kopje two figures--the one, a dog, white and sleek, one yellow ear hanging down over his left eye; the other, his master, a lad of fourteen, and no other than the boy Waldo, grown into a heavy, slouching youth of fourteen. The dog mounted the kopje quickly, his master followed slowly. He wore an aged jacket much too large for him, and rolled up at the wrists, and, as of old, a pair of dilapidated velschoens and a felt hat. He stood before the two girls at last.  “What have you been doing today?” asked Lyndall, lifting her eyes to his face.  “Looking after ewes and lambs below the dam. Here!” he said, holding out his hand awkwardly, “I brought them for you.”  There were a few green blades of tender grass.  “Where did you find them?”  “On the dam wall.”  She fastened them beside the leaf on her blue pinafore.  “They look nice there,” said the boy, awkwardly rubbing his great hands and watching her.  “Yes; but the pinafore spoils it all; it is not pretty.”  He looked at it closely.  “Yes, the squares are ugly; but it looks nice upon you--beautiful.”  He now stood silent before them, his great hands hanging loosely at either side.  “Some one has come today,” he mumbled out suddenly, when the idea struck him.  “Who?” asked both girls.  “An Englishman on foot.”  “What does he look like?” asked Em.  “I did not notice; but he has a very large nose,” said the boy slowly. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],["title","The Story of an African Farm (#3)"],["body","“He asked the way to the house.”  “Didn’t he tell you his name?”  “Yes--Bonaparte Blenkins.”  “Bonaparte!” said Em, “why that is like the reel Hottentot Hans plays on the violin--       ‘Bonaparte, Bonaparte, my wife is sick;       In the middle of the week, but Sundays not,       I give her rice and beans for soup’--  It is a funny name.”  “There was a living man called Bonaparte once,” said she of the great eyes.  “Ah yes, I know,” said Em--“the poor prophet whom the lions ate. I am always so sorry for him.”  Her companion cast a quiet glance upon her.  “He was the greatest man who ever lived,” she said, “the man I like best.”  “And what did he do?” asked Em, conscious that she had made a mistake, and that her prophet was not the man.  “He was one man, only one,” said her little companion slowly, “yet all the people in the world feared him. He was not born great, he was common as we are; yet he was master of the world at last. Once he was only a little child, then he was a lieutenant, then he was a general, then he was an emperor. When he said a thing to himself he never forgot it. He waited, and waited and waited, and it came at last.”  “He must have been very happy,” said Em.  “I do not know,” said Lyndall; “but he had what he said he would have, and that is better than being happy. He was their master, and all the people were white with fear of him. They joined together to fight him. He was one and they were many, and they got him down at last. They were like the wild cats when their teeth are fast in a great dog, like cowardly wild cats,” said the child, “they would not let him go. There were many; he was only one. They sent him to an island on the sea, a lonely island, and kept him there fast. He was one man, and they were many, and they were terrified at him. It was glorious!” said the child.  “And what then?” said Em.  “Then he was alone there in that island with men to watch him always,”  said her companion, slowly and quietly. “And in the long lonely nights he used to lie awake and think of the things he had done in the old days, and the things he would do if they let him go again. In the day when he walked near the shore it seemed to him that the sea all around him was a cold chain about his body pressing him to death.”  “And then?” said Em, much interested.  “He died there in that island; he never got away.”  “It is rather a nice story,” said Em; “but the end is sad.”  “It is a terrible, hateful ending,” said the little teller of the story, leaning forward on her folded arms; “and the worst is, it is true. I have noticed,” added the child very deliberately, “that it is only the made-up stories that end nicely; the true ones all end so.”  As she spoke the boy’s dark, heavy eyes rested on her face.  “You have read it, have you not?”  He nodded. “Yes; but the Brown history tells only what he did, not what he thought.”  “It was in the Brown history that I read of him,” said the girl; “but I know what he thought. Books do not tell everything.”  “No,” said the boy, slowly drawing nearer to her and sitting down at her feet. “What you want to know they never tell.”  Then the children fell into silence, till Doss, the dog, growing uneasy at its long continuance, sniffed at one and the other, and his master broke forth suddenly:  “If they could talk, if they could tell us now!” he said, moving his hand out over the surrounding objects--“then we would know something. This kopje, if it could tell us how it came here! The ‘Physical Geography’ says,” he went on most rapidly and confusedly, “that what were dry lands now were once lakes; and what I think is this--these low hills were once the shores of a lake; this kopje is some of the stones that were at the bottom, rolled together by the water. But there is this--How did the water come to make one heap here alone, in the centre of the plain?” It was a ponderous question; no one volunteered an answer. “When I was little,” said the boy, “I always looked at it and wondered, and I thought a great giant was buried under it. Now I know the water must have done it; but how? It is very wonderful. Did one little stone come first, and stop the others as they rolled?” said the boy with earnestness, in a low voice, more as speaking to himself than to them.  “Oh, Waldo, God put the little kopje here,” said Em with solemnity.  “But how did he put it here?”  “By wanting.”  “But how did the wanting bring it here?”  “Because it did.”  The last words were uttered with the air of one who produces a clinching argument. What effect it had on the questioner was not evident, for he made no reply, and turned away from her.  Drawing closer to Lyndall’s feet, he said after a while in a low voice:  “Lyndall, has it never seemed to you that the stones were talking with you? Sometimes,” he added in a yet lower tone, “I lie under there with my sheep, and it seems that the stones are really speaking--speaking of the old things, of the time when the strange fishes and animals lived that are turned into stone now, and the lakes were here; and then of the time when the little Bushmen lived here, so small and so ugly, and used to sleep in the wild dog holes, and in the sloots, and eat snakes, and shot the bucks with their poisoned arrows. It was one of them, one of these old wild Bushmen, that painted those,” said the boy, nodding toward the pictures--“one who was different from the rest. He did not know why, but he wanted to make something beautiful--he wanted to make something, so he made these. He worked hard, very hard, to find the juice to make the paint; and then he found this place where the rocks hang over, and he painted them. To us they are only strange things, that make us laugh; but to him they were very beautiful.”  The children had turned round and looked at the pictures.  “He used to kneel here naked, painting, painting, painting; and he wondered at the things he made himself,” said the boy, rising and moving his hand in deep excitement. “Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a little yellow face peeping out among the stones.” He paused, a dreamy look coming over his face. “And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on here, looking at everything like they look now. I know that it is I who am thinking,” the fellow added slowly, “but it seems as though it were they who are talking. Has it never seemed so to you, Lyndall?”  “No, it never seems so to me,” she answered.  The sun had dipped now below the hills, and the boy, suddenly remembering the ewes and lambs, started to his feet.  “Let us also go to the house and see who has come,” said Em, as the boy shuffled away to rejoin his flock, while Doss ran at his heels, snapping at the ends of the torn trousers as they fluttered in the wind.     Chapter 1.III. I Was A Stranger, and Ye Took Me In.  As the two girls rounded the side of the kopje, an unusual scene presented itself. A large group was gathered at the back door of the homestead.  On the doorstep stood the Boer-woman, a hand on each hip, her face red and fiery, her head nodding fiercely. At her feet sat the yellow Hottentot maid, her satellite, and around stood the black Kaffer maids, with blankets twisted round their half-naked figures. Two, who stamped mealies in a wooden block, held the great stampers in their hands, and stared stupidly at the object of attraction. It certainly was not to look at the old German overseer, who stood in the centre of the group, that they had all gathered together. His salt-and-pepper suit, grizzly black beard, and grey eyes were as familiar to every one on the farm as the red gables of the homestead itself; but beside him stood the stranger, and on him all eyes were fixed. Ever and anon the newcomer cast a glance over his pendulous red nose to the spot where the Boer-woman stood, and smiled faintly.  “I’m not a child,” cried the Boer-woman, in low Cape Dutch, “and I wasn’t born yesterday. No, by the Lord, no! You can’t take me in! My mother didn’t wean me on Monday. One wink of my eye and I see the whole thing. I’ll have no tramps sleeping on my farm,” cried Tant Sannie blowing. “No, by the devil, no! not though he had sixty-times-six red noses.”  There the German overseer mildly interposed that the man was not a tramp, but a highly respectable individual, whose horse had died by an accident three days before.  “Don’t tell me,” cried the Boer-woman; “the man isn’t born that can take me in. If he’d had money, wouldn’t he have bought a horse? Men who walk are thieves, liars, murderers, Rome’s priests, seducers! I see the devil in his nose!” cried Tant Sannie shaking her fist at him; “and to come walking into the house of this Boer’s child and shaking hands as though he came on horseback! Oh, no, no!”  The stranger took off his hat, a tall, battered chimneypot, and disclosed a bald head, at the back of which was a little fringe of curled white hair, and he bowed to Tant Sannie.  “What does she remark, my friend?” he inquired, turning his crosswise-looking eyes on the old German.  The German rubbed his old hands and hesitated.  “Ah--well--ah--the--Dutch--you know--do not like people who walk--in this country--ah!”  “My dear friend,” said the stranger, laying his hand on the German’s arm, “I should have bought myself another horse, but crossing, five days ago, a full river, I lost my purse--a purse with five hundred pounds in it. I spent five days on the bank of the river trying to find it--couldn’t. Paid a Kaffer nine pounds to go in and look for it at the risk of his life--couldn’t find it.”  The German would have translated this information, but the Boer-woman gave no ear.  “No, no; he goes tonight. See how he looks at me--a poor unprotected female! If he wrongs me, who is to do me right?” cried Tant Sannie.  “I think,” said the German in an undertone, “if you didn’t look at her quite so much it might be advisable. She--ah--she--might--imagine that you"]]]
