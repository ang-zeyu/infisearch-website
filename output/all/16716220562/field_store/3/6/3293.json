When it melts in your mouth, that's proof it will melt in      the pan.  Beyond all this (and in spite of the school that plumps for the No. 2 temperance alternative) we must point out that beer has a special affinity for Cheddar. The French have clearly established this in their names for Welsh Rabbit, _Fromage Fondue à la Bière_ and _Fondue à l'Anglaise_.  To prepare such a cheese for the pan, each Rabbit hound may have a preference all his own, for here the question comes up of how it melts best. Do you shave, slice, dice, shred, mince, chop, cut, scrape or crumble it in the fingers? This will vary according to one's temperament and the condition of the cheese. Generally, for best results it is coarsely grated. When it comes to making all this into a rare bit of Rabbit there is:   The One and Only Method  Use a double boiler, or preferably a chafing dish, avoiding aluminum and other soft metals. Heat the upper pan by simmering water in the lower one, but don't let the water boil up or touch the top pan.  Most, but not all, Rabbits are begun by heating a bit of butter or margarine in the pan in which one cup of roughly grated cheese, usually sharp Cheddar, is melted and mixed with one-half cup of liquid, added gradually. (The butter isn't necessary for a cheese that should melt by itself.)  The two principal ingredients are melted smoothly together and kept from curdling by stirring steadily in one direction only, over an even heat. The spoon used should be of hard wood, sterling silver or porcelain. Never use tin, aluminum or soft metal--the taste may come off to taint the job.  Be sure the liquid is at room temperature, or warmer, and add it gradually, without interrupting the stirring. Do not let it come to the bubbling point, and never let it boil.  Add seasonings only when the cheese is melted, which will take two or three minutes. Then continue to stir in the same direction without an instant's letup, for maybe ten minutes or more, until the Rabbit is smooth. The consistency and velvety smoothness depend a good deal on whether or not an egg, or a beaten yolk, is added.  The hotter the Rabbit is served, the better. You can sizzle the top with a salamander or other branding iron, but in any case set it forth as nearly sizzling as possible, on toast hellishly hot, whether it's browned or buttered on one side or both.  Give a thought to the sad case of the \"little dog whose name was Rover, and when he was dead he was dead all over.\" Something very similar happens with a Rabbit that's allowed to cool down--when it's cold it's cold all over, and you can't resuscitate it by heating.   BASIC WELSH RABBIT   No. 1 (with beer)  2 tablespoons butter 3 cups grated old Cheddar 1/2 teaspoon English dry mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt A dash of cayenne 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 egg yolks, lightly beaten with 1/2 cup light beer or ale 4 slices hot buttered toast       Over boiling water melt butter and cheese together, stirring      steadily with a wooden (or other tasteless) spoon in one      direction only. Add seasonings and do not interrupt your rhythmic      stirring, as you pour in a bit at a time of the beer-and-egg      mixture until it's all used up.       It may take many minutes of constant stirring to achieve the      essential creamy thickness and then some more to slick it out as      smooth as velvet.       Keep it piping hot but don't let it bubble, for a boiled Rabbit      is a spoiled Rabbit. Only unremitting stirring (and the best of      cheese) will keep it from curdling, getting stringy or rubbery.      Pour the Rabbit generously over crisp, freshly buttered toast      and serve instantly on hot plates.  Usually crusts are cut off the bread before toasting, and some aesthetes toast one side only, spreading the toasted side with cold butter for taste contrast. Lay the toast on the hot plate, buttered side down, and pour the Rabbit over the porous untoasted side so it can soak in. (This is recommended in Lady Llanover's recipe, which appears on page 52 of this book.)  Although the original bread for Rabbit toast was white, there is now no limit in choice among whole wheat, graham, rolls, muffins, buns, croutons and crackers, to infinity.    No. 2 (with milk)  For a rich milk Rabbit use 1/2 cup thin cream, evaporated milk, whole milk or buttermilk, instead of beer as in No. 1. Then, to keep everything bland, cut down the mustard by half or leave it out, and use paprika in place of cayenne. As in No. 1, the use of Worcestershire sauce is optional, although our feeling is that any spirited Rabbit would resent its being left out.  Either of these basic recipes can be made without eggs, and more cheaply, although the beaten egg is a guarantee against stringiness. When the egg is missing, we are sad to record that a teaspoon or so of cornstarch generally takes its place.  Rabbiteers are of two minds about fast and slow heating and stirring, so you'll have to adjust that to your own experience and rhythm. As a rule, the heat is reduced when the cheese is almost melted, and speed of stirring slows when the eggs and last ingredients go in.  Many moderns who have found that monosodium glutamate steps up the flavor of natural cheese, put it in at the start, using one-half teaspoon for each cup of grated Cheddar. When it comes to pepper you are fancy-free. As both black and white pepper are now held in almost equal esteem, you might equip your hutch with twin hand-mills to do the grinding fresh, for this is always worth the trouble. Tabasco sauce is little used and needs a cautious hand, but some addicts can't leave it out any more than they can swear off the Worcestershire.  The school that plumps for malty Rabbits and the other that goes for milky ones are equally emphatic in their choice. So let us consider the compromise of our old friend Frederick Philip Stieff, the Baltimore _homme de bouche_, as he set it forth for us years ago in _10,000 Snacks_: \"The idea of cooking a Rabbit with beer is an exploded and dangerous theory. Tap your keg or open your case of ale or beer and serve _with_, not in your Rabbit.\"    The Stieff Recipe BASIC MILK RABBIT (_completely surrounded by a lake of malt beverages_)  2 cups grated sharp cheese 3 heaping tablespoons butter 1-1/2 cups milk 4 eggs 1 heaping tablespoon mustard 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce Pepper, salt and paprika to taste--then add more of each.       Grease well with butter the interior of your double boiler so      that no hard particles of cheese will form in the mixture later      and contribute undesirable lumps.       Put cheese, well-grated, into the double boiler and add butter      and milk. From this point vigorous stirring should be indulged in      until Rabbit is ready for serving.       Prepare a mixture of Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, salt      and paprika. These should be beaten until light and then slowly      poured into the double boiler. Nothing now remains to be done      except to stir and cook down to proper consistency over a fairly      slow flame. The finale has not arrived until you can drip the      rabbit from the spoon and spell the word _finis_ on the surface.      Pour over two pieces of toast per plate and send anyone home who      does not attack it at once.       This is sufficient for six gourmets or four gourmands.  _Nota bene_: A Welsh Rabbit, to be a success, should never be of the consistency whereby it may be used to tie up bundles, nor yet should it bounce if inadvertently dropped on the kitchen floor.    Lady Llanover's Toasted Welsh Rabbit       Cut a slice of the real Welsh cheese made of sheep's and cow's      milk; toast it at the fire on both sides, but not so much as to      drop (melt). Toast on one side a piece of bread less than 1/4      inch thick, to be quite crisp, and spread it very thinly with      fresh, cold butter on the toasted side. (It must not be      saturated.) Lay the toasted cheese upon the untoasted bread side      and serve immediately on a very hot plate. The butter on the      toast can, of course, be omitted. (It is more frequently eaten      without butter.)  From this original toasting of the cheese many Englishmen still call Welsh Rabbit \"Toasted Cheese,\" but Lady Llanover goes on to point out that the Toasted Rabbit of her Wales and the Melted or Stewed Buck Rabbit of England (which has become our American standard) are as different in the making as the regional cheeses used in them, and she says that while doctors prescribed the toasted Welsh as salubrious for invalids, the stewed cheese of Olde England was \"only adapted to strong digestions.\"  English literature rings with praise for the toasted cheese of Wales and England. There is Christopher North's eloquent \"threads of unbeaten gold, shining like gossamer filaments (that may be pulled from its tough and tenacious substance).\"  Yet not all of the references are complimentary.  Thus Shakespeare in _King Lear_:      Look, look a mouse!     Peace, peace;--this piece of toasted cheese will do it.  And Sydney Smith's:       Old friendships are destroyed by toasted cheese, and hard salted      meat has led to suicide.  But Rhys Davis in _My Wales_ makes up for such rudenesses:       _The Welsh Enter Heaven_       The Lord had been complaining to St. Peter of the dearth of good      singers in Heaven. \"Yet,\" He said testily, \"I hear excellent      singing outside the walls. Why are not those singers here with      me?\"       St. Peter said, \"They are the Welsh. They refuse to come in; they      say they are happy enough outside, playing with a ball and boxing      and singing such songs as '_Suspan Fach_'\"       The Lord said, \"I wish them to come in here to sing Bach and      Mendelssohn. See that they are in before sundown.\"       St. Peter went to the Welsh and gave them the commands of the      Lord. But still they shook their heads. Harassed, St. Peter went      to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],["title","The Complete Book of Cheese (#8)"],["body"," with St. David, who, with a smile, was reading the      works of Caradoc Evans.       St. David said, \"Try toasted cheese. Build a fire just inside the      gates and get a few angels to toast cheese in front of it\" This      St. Peter did. The heavenly aroma of the sizzling, browning      cheese was wafted over the walls and, with loud shouts, a great      concourse of the Welsh came sprinting in. When sufficient were      inside to make up a male voice choir of a hundred, St Peter      slammed the gates. However, it is said that these are the only      Welsh in Heaven.  And, lest we forget, the wonderful drink that made Alice grow and grow to the ceiling of Wonderland contained not only strawberry jam but toasted cheese.  Then there's the frightening nursery rhyme:      The Irishman loved usquebaugh,       The Scot loved ale called Bluecap.     The Welshman, he loved toasted cheese,       And made his mouth like a mousetrap.      The Irishman was drowned in usquebaugh,       The Scot was drowned in ale,     The Welshman he near swallowed a mouse       But he pulled it out by the tail.  And, perhaps worst of all, Shakespeare, no cheese-lover, this tune in _Merry Wives of Windsor_:      'Tis time I were choked by a bit of toasted cheese.  An elaboration of the simple Welsh original went English with Dr. William Maginn, the London journalist whose facile pen enlivened the _Blackwoods Magazine_ era with _Ten Tales_:       [Illustration] Dr. Maginn's Rabbit       Much is to be said in favor of toasted cheese for supper. It is      the cant to say that Welsh rabbit is heavy eating. I like it best      in the genuine Welsh way, however--that is, the toasted bread      buttered on both sides profusely, then a layer of cold roast beef      with mustard and horseradish, and then, on the top of all, the      superstratum, of Cheshire _thoroughly_ saturated, while, in the      process of toasting, with genuine porter, black pepper, and      shallot vinegar. I peril myself upon the assertion that this is      not a heavy supper for a man who has been busy all day till      dinner in reading, writing, walking or riding--who has occupied      himself between dinner and supper in the discussion of a bottle      or two of sound wine, or any equivalent--and who proposes to      swallow at least three tumblers of something hot ere he resigns      himself to the embrace of Somnus. With these provisos, I      recommend toasted cheese for supper.  The popularity of this has come down to us in the succinct summing-up, \"Toasted cheese hath no master.\"  The Welsh original became simple after Dr. Maginn's supper sandwich was served, a century and a half ago; for it was served as a savory to sum up and help digest a dinner, in this form:    After-Dinner Rabbit       Remove all crusts from bread slices, toast on both sides and soak      to saturation in hot beer. Melt thin slices of sharp old cheese      in butter in an iron skillet, with an added spot of beer and dry      English mustard. Stir steadily with a wooden spoon and, when      velvety, serve a-sizzle on piping hot beer-soaked toast.  While toasted cheese undoubtedly was the Number One dairy dish of Anglo-Saxons, stewed cheese came along to rival it in Elizabethan London. This sophisticated, big-city dish, also called a Buck Rabbit, was the making of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese on Fleet Street, where Dr. Johnson later presided. And it must have been the pick of the town back in the days when barrooms still had sawdust on the floor, for the learned Doctor endorsed old Omar Khayyam's love of the pub with: \"There is nothing which has been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern.\" Yet he was no gourmet, as may be judged by his likening of a succulent, golden-fried oyster to \"a baby's ear dropped in sawdust.\"  Perhaps it is just as well that no description of the world's first Golden Buck has come down from him. But we don't have to look far for on-the-spot pen pictures by other men of letters at \"The Cheese,\" as it was affectionately called. To a man they sang praises for that piping hot dish of preserved and beatified milk.  Inspired by stewed cheese, Mark Lemon, the leading rhymester of _Punch_, wrote the following poem and dedicated it to the memory of Lovelace:      Champagne will not a dinner make,       Nor caviar a meal     Men gluttonous and rich may take       Those till they make them ill         If I've potatoes to my chop,         And after chop have cheese,         Angels in Pond and Spiers's shop         Know no such luxuries.  All that's necessary is an old-time \"cheese stewer\" or a reasonable substitute. The base of this is what was once quaintly called a \"hot-water bath.\" This was a sort of miniature wash boiler just big enough to fit in snugly half a dozen individual tins, made squarish and standing high enough above the bath water to keep any of it from getting into the stew. In these tins the cheese is melted. But since such a tinsmith's contraption is hard to come by in these days of fireproof cooking glass, we suggest muffin tins, ramekins or even small cups to crowd into the bottom of your double boiler or chafing dish. But beyond this we plump for a revival of the \"cheese stewer\" in stainless steel, silver or glass.  In the ritual at \"The Cheese,\" these dishes, brimming over, \"bubbling and blistering with the stew,\" followed a pudding that's still famous. Although down the centuries the recipe has been kept secret, the identifiable ingredients have been itemized as follows: \"Tender steak, savory oyster, seductive kidney, fascinating lark, rich gravy, ardent pepper and delicate paste\"--not to mention mushrooms. And after the second or third helping of pudding, with a pint of stout, bitter, or the mildest and mellowest brown October Ale in a dented pewter pot, \"the stewed Cheshire cheese.\"  Cheese was the one and only other course prescribed by tradition and appetite from the time when Charles II aled and regaled Nell Gwyn at \"The Cheese,\" where Shakespeare is said to have sampled this \"kind of a glorified Welsh Rarebit, served piping hot in the square shallow tins in which it is cooked and garnished with sippets of delicately colored toast.\"  Among early records is this report of Addison's in _The Spectator_ of September 25,1711:       They yawn for a Cheshire cheese, and begin about midnight, when      the whole company is disposed to be drowsy. He that yawns widest,      and at the same time so naturally as to produce the most yawns      amongst his spectators, carries home the cheese.  Only a short time later, in 1725, the proprietor of Simpson's in the Strand inaugurated a daily guessing contest that drew crowds to his fashionable eating and drinking place. He would set forth a huge portion of cheese and wager champagne and cigars for the house that no one present could correctly estimate the weight, height and girth of it.  As late as 1795, when Boswell was accompanying Dr. Johnson to \"The Cheese,\" records of St. Dunstan's Club, which also met there, showed that the current price of a Buck Rabbit was tuppence, and that this was also the amount of the usual tip.    Ye Original Recipe  1-1/2 ounces butter 1 cup cream 1-1/2 cups grated Cheshire cheese (more pungent, snappier, richer, and more brightly colored than its first cousin, Cheddar)       Heat butter and cream together, then stir in the cheese and let      it stew.       You dunk fingers of toast directly into your individual tin, or      pour the Stewed Rabbit over toast and brown the top under a      blistering salamander.       The salamander is worth modernizing, too, so you can brand your      own Rabbits with your monogram or the design of your own      Rabbitry. Such a branding iron might be square, like the stew      tin, and about the size of a piece of toast  It is notable that there is no beer or ale in this recipe, but not lamentable, since all aboriginal cheese toasts were washed down in tossing seas of ale, beer, porter, stout, and 'arf and 'arf.  This creamy Stewed Buck, on which the literary greats of Johnson's time supped while they smoked their church wardens, received its highest praise from an American newspaper woman who rhapsodized in 1891: \"Then came stewed cheese, on the thin shaving of crisp, golden toast in hot silver saucers--so hot that the cheese was the substance of thick cream, the flavor of purple pansies and red raspberries commingled.\"  This may seem a bit flowery, but in truth many fine cheeses hold a trace of the bouquet of the flowers that have enriched the milk. Alpine blooms and herbs haunt the Gruyère, Parmesan wafts the scent of Parma violets, the Flower Cheese of England is perfumed with the petals of rose, violet, marigold and jasmine.    Oven Rabbit (FROM AN OLD RECIPE)       Chop small 1/2 pound of cooking cheese. Put it, with a piece of      butter the size of a walnut, in a little saucepan, and as the      butter melts and the cheese gets warm, mash them together,       When softened add 2 yolks of eggs, 1/2 teacupful of ale, a little      cayenne pepper and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon one way only,      until it is creamy, but do not let it boil, for that would spoil      it. Place some slices of buttered toast on a dish, pour the      Rarebit upon them, and set inside-the oven about 2 minutes before      serving.    Yorkshire Rabbit _(originally called Gherkin Buck, from a pioneer recipe_)       Put into a saucepan 1/2 pound of cheese, sprinkle with pepper      (black, of course) to taste, pour over 1/2 teacup of ale, and      convert the whole into a smooth, creamy mass, over the fire,      stirring continually, for about 10 minutes.       In 2 more minutes it should be done. (10 minutes altogether is      the minimum.) Pour it over slices of hot toast, place a piece of      broiled bacon on the top of each and serve as hot as possible.    Golden Buck       A Golden Buck is simply the Basic Welsh Rabbit with"]]]
