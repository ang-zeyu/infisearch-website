GUAGUA, VUT.  18, 19. _Possessive Pronouns_ are the genitives of the primitive; thus, no vónama, means, my hat, no being the genitive of nee, and the same with the rest. But in order to say, this is mine, guagua is used applied to inanimate things, as, veride quit no guagua, this is my house; or vut applied to animate, as, veride cavadu no vut, this horse is mine; and with the change of person those genitives of the primitive must be added, as, no guagua, mine; amo guagua, thine, are guagua, his, &c., no vut, mine, &c.

Wanting.                                    _Plural._   Hiósguavu, write ye.  Another form of the IMPERATIVE made with ásma, to see.                                    _Singular._   Asmane\\                                 Asmane\\   Asmana > hiósguatze,                    Asmana > hiósguatzidauh,   Asmair/  I will see that I write, &c.,  Asmair/  I shall see that I                                                       be written, &c.,  ANOTHER IMPERATIVE.    Venésmana hiósguam,        Even though you write.   Venesmatze em hiósguame,   Even though ye write.  ANOTHER IMPERATIVE.                                    _Singular._   Nee eme hiósguaco naquém,               Nee eme hiósguarico naquém.   I will that you write.

I will that they be written.  OPTATIVE MOOD.  This mood appears to have been anciently used with cáne, would that it might be! but now in general it is not so understood. The phrase may be deemed to be in the Optative, although it does not express that entirely, being formed by the union of the Imperative above with venesma, even though.    Venésmane hiósguam,                     Venésmane hiósguadauh,   I would that it might be, or,           I would that it might be, or,   Even though I may write.                Even though I may be written.  SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.  This mode of speech, If I should write, I should have written, &c., the natives express by adding the particle _ru_ to the future.                                   _Singular._   Nee \\                             Nee \\   Nap  > ghiósuatzeru,              Nap  > hiósquatzidauhru   Id  / If I should write, &c.      Id  /  If I should be written, &c.                                    _Plural._   Tamide\\                           Tamide\\   Emét   > hiósguatzeru,            Emét   > hiósguatzidauru,   Amet  /  If we should write, &c.  Amet  /  If we should be written, &c.[4]  [Footnote 4: Conjunctions, corresponding to _aunque, paraque, cuando_, and the like which it is common to make use of with the subjunctive in Spanish do not exist in the language.]  INFINITIVE MOOD.  Although this mode does not exist in the language, still the natives have ways to express the thought, some of which are these:  One mode is by the verb erám, I wish or think; so that to say, I wish to write, Nee hiósguavaerám may be used, which is the future hiósguatze, with the final syllable omitted for the particle va, and followed by the erám. In the same manner, other verbs may be proceeded with, they remaining stable through all the mutations that erám undergoes, as in the following:   ACTIVE VOICE.  INDICATIVE MOOD.    _Present_, Erám, I wish.          _Pluperfect_, Ehritu, I had wished.   _Imperfect_, Eramtu, I wished.    _Future_, Erátze, I shall wish.   _Perfect_, Ehri, I have wished.   SUBJUNCTIVE, (Impt?) Erátzern, I might wish, etc.  In the passive erám is not used, but naquém, which also means, I wish, and with the preterite particle, in the manner that is stated in the fourth form of the imperative, the infinitive mood in this voice is expressed, as, Nee no hiósguarico naquém, I desire to be written.  Another mode that serves for the Infinitive, is that after a verb of motion, the future of the verb is used, as to express, I come to you to say, Nee eme queitudetze güerem: here, Nee is I; eme, to you; güerem, or üerem, I come, and queitudetze the future of the verb queituden, I say, or make known.  GERUNDS.  The gerund in _di_ is found in the expression: Already arrived the time of labor; for which, taking the preterite pánauhri, the verb pánauan signifying labor, add dagua, time, and for arrived use hassíde, the preterite of hássem, followed by the de, particle, signifying already, and the phrase is formed pánauhridagua hasside.  The gerund in _do_ is found in the phrase Vus hóquedo panavame, the boys playing, work, in which vus is boys, hóquedo or hóqueco, the gerund of hoquen, play, and panavame, the plural of pánavan, work. The passive voice has likewise the gerund, as for example: Nap sícriuhdo cotzóm, Whilst thou art shorn, sleepest; here nap cotzóm is, you sleep, sícriuhdo is the gerund in do passive of the verb sicán, and toasquilo, hair.  The gerund in _dum_, and supine joined to a verb of motion is equivalent to the future as before stated in the second mode of the infinitive; but should there be no verb of movement with the gerund in dum, the particle betzéuai, for,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14419"],["title","Grammatical Sketch of the Heve Language (#3)"],["body"," used, as this suffices for payment, (hoc ad solvendum sufficit,) Veride hasem ovíde betzéguai; veride meaning this, hasem, suffices; ovide betzévai, for payment; ovíden signifying pay.  Thus much it has been found necessary to say of the verb in its active and passive voice, of its modes and times, which will serve as a paradigm for the conjugation of any verb observant of the form of its preterite and future (the roots whence rise the other tenses) to be discovered in the vocabulary.  FREQUENTATIVE VERB.  21. This verb signifies the frequent repetition of the same action, and is formed by adding the adverb tátze, peace-meal, as, I write often, tátze ne hiósgan.  COMPULSIVE VERB.  22. It is thus called because it signifies to cause or compel to do any thing, and is formed by taking away the last syllable of any verb and replacing it with tudem or tuden, which alone is conjugated, and has the perfect tudari, and future tudetze, as varuhtúden, I cause to sin; verúhtze being the future of varúuen.  APPLICATIVE VERB.  23. When the action is for, by, or through, (\"para ó por,\") this verb is used, having its termination in dem or den, perfect, deri, and future, detze; as pánauan, work; whence is formed pánauiden, which is the applicative, so that to say, I work for you, the phrase is Nee eme pánauiden; and the mother to express, My son has failed me, (died), says, No nótzi múquideri; although in the place of this applicative the preposition betzéguai, for, is used likewise, or de, by; as, Christ died for us, Cristo tamo betzéguai, or tamóde múqui.  CONTINUATIVE VERB.  24. This verb serves to continue the action, and is made from the future, omitting the tze and substituting sem or sen, as nenérsem, I am continually talking, from nehren, I speak; the future, nenértze; biquesen, I am thus singing, from biquen, I sing; future, bequetze, for which there appearing to be no perfect, the imperfect, bíquesenru may be used, and the same is the case with the words that end in hon, as merihon, go running; nenerhon, be speaking; biquehon, be singing, of which the future termination is sintze, as nenérsintze.  COMPLETIVE VERB.  25. This gives completeness to the signification of the word out of which it is made so full that nothing remains further, and is formed of the future taking away the final tze, and placing suam instead, as, baán, I eat; bétze, I will eat; besuam, I eat until I have finished it all; todam, I leave; todetz, I will leave; todesuam, I leave forever,--at once. The penitent may say, Oquine haóna no cananacemca todesuatze, Now, forevermore, I will leave my sins; the perfect being formed in coari, and the future in uatze.  ESTIMATIVE VERB.  26. This denotes the judgment that one forms of anything, as, dénitzem, I judge it good; déni meaning good; hana Diosi denitzem, perhaps you esteem God? nee eme deosaritzem, I judge you happy; deosari meaning happy; nee eme náventzem, I consider you poor--pity you; náven meaning poor: and they form the perfect, tziui, and future tziúhtze.  CONVERSIVE VERB.  27. When a thing changes so as to pass from one to another form or quality, this verb is used. Earth, tevat; genitive, teuhte; accusative, teuhta, whence comes the verb teúhtuun, I make me earth,--as do the sticks become, and bodies that rot. So dóhmetum, make man, explains the mystery of the incarnation, as, God the Son made himself man for us, Dios noquát tamóde, or tamo, betzeguai dóhmetui. So batuum, is made water, bat, water; nasórtaan, I throw away; nasórtuun, is thrown away, to become corruption; of which the perfect is tui, the future, tutze.  28. There are some _Compound Verbs_ which end in donon, signifying to go to do something, which appear to be formed from the future, omitting the last syllable tze, and substituting donon, as amúdonon, I go to hunt; amún being, I hunt; the future amútze; cumándonon, I go to gather wood, from cumánan, I gather wood, future cumantze; baudónon, I go to bring water, formed of bat, water; vun, the future of vtze, bring, and donon, which has the perfect doni, and future dontze.  29. The termination guan, is usually a sign of the _Active Verb_, as in mótzguan, I begin: máguan, or máhuan, I plough, and is added by the natives to some Spanish words they use, such are perdonároguan, I pardon; ayunároguan, I fast; velároguan, I watch. Some form the perfect in guari, and future in guatze; others the perfect in uhri, and future in úhtze, úitze, or in guatze.  30. To form _Compound Neuter Verbs_, the verb dáan, I go, is frequently used, as bahútunan, I melt (active); bahútudaan, I melt, or am melting, the neuter, barínan, I soften; baricdaan, I go on to soften; zicónan, I break; zicócdaan, I break (neuter); the perfect being dai, the future, détze.  31. _Other Neuters_ are formed of active verbs ending in an by changing it into en, as sebán, I freeze; seben, freeze; basán, I ripen; basen, ripen; sepán, cool; sepen, cool; nacuan, hurt; nacuen, hurt. To form the perfect, the en is changed into i; but the future, although it always ends in tze, differs, as will appear by the vocabulary.  32. In the same manner as of Active Verbs in an, _Neuter Verbs_ in en are made, so from other actives in an, neuters are made in un, as, busán, I awake another; busún, I awake me; tutzan, I quench; tucún, I quench me, in the perfect changing the un to i, and the future to tze.  PLURAL OF VERBS.  33. This language has the notable peculiarity of the verbs oftentimes differing greatly in the plural from the singular, as, vaquén, enter one; múume, enter many; vóon, one to lay down; medáguame, lay down many; méran, one to run; vóome, many to run; batémucun, to drown oneself; betécoome, many to drown themselves; batemean, drown one; batecódan, drown many.  34. There are many _Compound Active Verbs_ ending in puguan or puuan, which signify to pluck, as beguát, skin, genitive; beúhte, accusative; beúhta, whence beuhpuuan, tear off the skin is formed, and from mo, hair of the human head comes mópuuan, pluck the hair, etc.; sequát, flower, genitive, seúhte; accusative, seúhta gives seúhpuuan, to pluck flowers; nágua; root, genitive, naúhte; accusative, naúhta, when naúhpuuan, eradicate, is formed, their perfect being in uhri, their future in natze.  ZEM, ZEN.  35. Estimative Verbs it has already been said end in tzem, but there are other verbs of that termination that signify certain passion, failing, or quality, as, hisumtzem, I am hungry; veráctzem, I am thirsty; vrútzen, I am hot; vtétzen, I am cold, which form their perfects in tziui, the futures in tzíuhtze.  TAAN.  36. _The Particle_ taan compounded with a substantive, signifies to do, as, sibúrtaan, to make girdles composed of sibúra, band; zántaan, to make arrows, zamát signifying arrow; vacotaan, to make bow, from vácotzi, that instrument; but when it is component of the verb it signifies, I say that I wish, thus from nósquen, I return, nósquitaan is made, signifying, I say that I wish to return, and from pánauan, labor, is pánauataan, I say that I wish to labor.  ENI, MANI, HABI,  Being the English substantive verb AM.  37. Such is the condition of this part of speech: yonder is a man, anát sei dor _eni_, and if he live there, or is there standing, anát catzí, etc., which catzí is used only for persons. Yonder is water, anát, or aguát bat _maní_, yonder is grass, anát dósa _habí_, and also may be said, bat eni, dosa eni, but bat habí, dosa mani would not be correct. Further than this the substantive verb am appears not to show itself clearly: thus that utterance of God, I am that I am, has no corresponding words in the tongue: it could seemingly be made somewhat intelligible in this wise: Nee uehva nee, which word for word means, I greatly I, and am is not expressed though understood. So in asking, Who is it, the answer is, Nee, and not I with the verb. This method of speaking should be regarded: to say the house of Pedro was my house, it should be, Pevroque qui no quiru, of which qui means house, and Pevroque qui, house of Pedro. The verb was, does not now exist in it apart, but in expression it appears, or nearly so, in the substantive qui, which is put in the imperfect by the termination of that tense, ru being added, as, quiru, was house; no quiru, was my house. The same is otherwise said: Pevroque qui no guaguaru, the house of Pedro was mine; the guagua, if alone, signifies, is mine.  MAGUAN.  38. There are several _Compound Verbs_ that end in maguan, which signify, to throw something to another, as, ermaguan, to throw blood (erát) on him; dósmaguan, to throw grass (dosát) on him; teúhmaguan, to throw dirt (tevát) on him; sitórimaguan, to throw honey (sitóri) on him, which form the perfect in guari, the future in guatze.  TADEN.  39 The _Particle_ táden, the terminal of several verbs, expresses the like or dislike the good or evil appearance of anything according to the name or adverb to which it is joined, as, neve sodóta nanactáden, or hidenatóden, I do not like this bower; tamide naven tamo tademe, we find ourselves poor; nee deosári no taden, I find myself fortunate, the perfect being found in taderi, the future in tadetze.  MUCUN.  40. Of the Verb _Mucún_, I die, compounds such as these are made: vrumucún, I die of heat; vrúcóome, they die of heat; hisú-mucún, I die of hunger; hisúmcóome, they die of hunger; varótmucún, I die of thirst; varó-coóme, they die of thirst; cúmemucún, I die of envy; cumecoáme, they die of envy. Vrútzen is, I have heat; hisúmtzen, I have hunger; veráctzen, I have thirst; cúmen, I have envy. The reason of changing mucún to form the plural may be seen in section 36.  NEOQUEN.  41. Neóquen, means I command, and observe this method as respects its use: Nee uneóquen, and I command to bring; nee nerta neóquen, and I command, to pray; nee ouit neóquen, and I command to call. Vtze is the future of vun, I bring; nertátze, I pray, the future of nértaan: ouictze the future of ouican, I call; so that the tze is taken from the"]]]
