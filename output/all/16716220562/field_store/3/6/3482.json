(Opposition cheers.)  MR. E. N. GROBLER (Edenburg) said:  The present was one of the best measures that the Government had so far brought forward, and it appeared clear that they had a Government which truly represented the wishes of the public. It was impossible to delay the solution of the Native problem, and legislation on the subject had for a long time past been asked for.* At the same time, he did not entirely agree with the methods, proposed to be applied, and he did not like the system of allocating reserves for Natives.  When once those reserves had been allocated, would it not result in injury to agriculture and cattle breeding?  The farmers would suffer from lack of labour, and that deficiency would be a growing one. Neither could he agree to the principle of expropriation of land belonging to whites in order to increase the size of the native reserves. He considered the Bill was a complicated one.  The matter should be settled by way of taxation, in the following way.  All Natives who were in the service of whites should be exempted from taxation, and treated as well as possible, and other Natives should be encouraged to take similar service.  There were enormous reserves where the Natives could go and live,** and if they refused to go there they should be required to pay a stiff tax.  Then they would go and work for white people. The hon. member for Tembuland had offered many objections to the Bill. They should make that hon. member king of Tembuland. In a country of the blind a man with one eye would be king.  -- * By a \"solution of the Native problem\", \"Free\" State farmers generally mean   the re-establishment of slavery. ** It will be observed that these and similar mythological disquisitions    subsequently formed General Botha's assurances to Mr. Harcourt.    See Chapter XVI.  But some light is thrown on the subject    of these visionary Native Reserves by Mr. Fawcus' speech    based on official statistics (page 36 [above -- last Fawcus quote]). --  MR. P. DUNCAN (Fordsburg) said he hoped the Minister would not take the view of the last speaker.  Under the Bill it would be possible for farmers to accumulate on their land as many Natives as they could get, so long as they could use them as servants.  (Labour cheers.) So far as he could see, even if it were carried out to the extent that it was proposed to go, it would not very much reduce the social contact which at present existed between whites and natives.  SIR W. B. BERRY (Queenstown) said he would like to know why the Minister had run away from the Bill that had passed the second reading, and now tabled another Bill in the shape of many amendments. One would naturally complain that, seeing that they had in that House a Native Affairs Committee, a non-party committee, specially chosen to consider all matters relating to native affairs, that Bill, which was a most important matter and dealt with native affairs from A to Z, should have been referred to that committee.  The same thing happened last session in reference to a Bill the Minister of Native Affairs kept on the paper until nearly the end of the session, and the House had to take the very unusual step almost on the last day of moving that committee proceedings on that Bill be taken that day six months. He (Sir W. B. Berry) proposed to move a similar amendment to the motion now before the House.  In the remarks he addressed when the Bill came up for second reading he had ventured to say that there was no call for a bill of that nature at all; there was no need for a Bill revolutionizing the attitude of the Union with respect to the natives generally.  The only clue they could get to the reason why the Bill was introduced was that a few die-hards on the other side of the House had given the Minister to understand that unless he brought in a Bill of that kind, or of a similarly drastic nature, the position of the Government was in danger.  He hoped some of these die-hards would come forward that evening and tell them plainly and bluntly why they wanted that Bill, why they were going to thrust it on the country without any notice, and why they were calling on the House to revolutionize the whole tenour and the whole order of things in regard to land matters as far as the Natives were concerned.  Proceeding, the hon. member said the only justification that had been offered for this Bill was that a large amount of land had been transferred from Europeans to Natives. An analysis of the return, however, showed that only sixteen farms in the Transvaal had been so transferred during the last three years. Surely that was not any justification why the European people of the Union should get into a panic and why the administration of the day were seeking to place on the Statute Book this most drastic legislation. Another reason why he objected to this Bill was that it purported to appoint a Commission to investigate to what extent and in what parts and in what time land should be selected by the Commission for the purpose of being reserved as additional native areas within the Union.  They were not given any guarantee that the Commission was going to be appointed nor any guarantee that it would ever report, but at the same time whilst these indefinite assurances were attempted to be given to the House there was no getting over this fact, that there was no time limit in the Bill by which the real enacting clause in the Bill was to have any cessation. When he spoke on this Bill before he supported it only on the understanding that a time limit was to be put in, or that it should be an annual Bill. He said unhesitatingly that the whole tendency of the Bill, as it stood at the second reading, and more especially as it stood with the amendments by the Minister on the notice paper, was to drive the Native peasant off the land.  The only refuge that that Native had was the town.  The country had not been prepared in any way for a Bill of this kind. A cry had been heard throughout the land against the iniquities proposed in the Bill.  If it had been found absolutely necessary that legislation of this kind should be introduced, the least that could be expected was that ample time should be given to the Natives to thoroughly acquire a knowledge of the contents of the measure. That opportunity had not been given them, and in this respect there was a very serious grievance.  For the good order and peace of the Union there was a very great danger ahead.  He had understood from those well versed in native affairs that one of the greatest dangers that could threaten us was to give the Natives anything in the shape of a common grievance.  Divide and rule had been a wise precaution in the government of the Natives.  When a common grievance was found by four or five million people one could understand how great that grievance must be.  One amendment the Minister had put on the paper must give serious pause.  The late Minister of Native Affairs issued to members last session a Squatters Bill.  The greatest objection to that measure, and one which he thought led to its withdrawal, was that it proposed to remove thousands upon thousands of natives from land which they had been in the occupation of for scores of years. It was in consequence of the disturbance which that Bill caused throughout the Union that it was withdrawn.  In one of the amendments on the paper the present Minister of Native Affairs brought back in a somewhat clandestine manner the most objectionable feature of the Bill that was withdrawn.  Mr. Speaker:  The amendment is not yet before the House.  SIR W. B. BERRY:  What Bill is it then that is to go into Committee? (Hear, hear.)  Is it the Bill which was read a second time or the Bill comprised in the Minister's amendments?  He moved that the House go into committee on the Bill this day six months.  MR. T. L. SCHREINER (Tembuland), in seconding the amendment, said that sufficient notice had not been given of the provisions of the Bill, although the Natives, thanks to the time which had elapsed since the second reading, were better acquainted with the measure than they were a little while ago.  Mr. Schreiner proceeded to quote opinions from native newspapers on the Bill. The `Tsala ea Batho', of Kimberley, said:  \"We are standing on the brink of the precipice.  We appealed to certain members of Parliament against the suspension clause in Mr. Sauer's Land Bill, and the result of our appeal has been an agreement between Sir Thomas Smartt and the Minister to the effect that the first part of the Bill only be proceeded with. The effect of this agreement is infinitely worse than the whole Bill. In its entirety, there were certain saving clauses, one of them practically excluding the Cape Province from the operation of the Bill. Under the present agreement, all these clauses are dropped, and section 1 of the Bill, which prohibits the sale of land between Europeans and Natives (pending the report of a future Commission) is applicable to all parts of the Union, including the Cape Province. Now, then, if this suspension clause becomes law, what is going to happen? It is simply this:  That the whole land policy of the Union of South Africa is the land policy of the Orange Free State, and it will be as difficult to abrogate that suspension as it is difficult to recall a bullet, once fired through some one's head, and resuscitate the victim. Our object then should be to prevent the pistol being fired off, as prevention is infinitely better than cure.\"  One paper that he was quoting from was (Mr. Schreiner went on to say) pleased, because it believed that this Bill was going to Select Committee. There was another native paper, published in Natal, which acknowledged the efforts which the missionaries had made on behalf "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],["title","Memories: A Story of German Love (#0)"],["body","German text    Transcriber's note:  This book contains several brief passages in German,                      each of which is followed by an English translation.

The translation of any work is at best a difficult task, and must inevitably be prejudicial to whatever of beauty the original possesses. When the principal charm of the original lies in its elegant simplicity, as in the case of the \"Deutsche Liebe,\" the difficulty is still further enhanced.  The translator has sought to reproduce the simple German in equally simple English, even at the risk of transferring German idioms into the English text.  The story speaks for itself.  Without plot, incidents or situations, it is nevertheless dramatically constructed, unflagging in interest, abounding in beauty, grace and pathos, and filled with the tenderest feeling of sympathy, which will go straight to the heart of every lover of the ideal in the world of humanity, and every worshipper in the world of nature.  Its brief essays upon theology, literature and social habits, contained in the dialogues between the hero and the heroine, will commend themselves to the thoughtful reader by their clearness and beauty of statement, as well as by their freedom from prejudice. \"Deutsche Liebe\" is a poem in prose, whose setting is all the more beautiful and tender, in that it is freed from the bondage of metre, and has been the unacknowledged source of many a poet's most striking utterances.  As such, the translator gives it to the public, confident that it will find ready acceptance among those who cherish the ideal, and a tender welcome by every lover of humanity.  The translator desires to make acknowledgments to J. J. Lalor, Esq., late of the Chicago _Tribune_ for his hearty co-operation in the progress of the work, and many valuable suggestions; to Prof. Feuling, the eminent philologist, of the University of Wisconsin, for his literal version of the extracts from the \"Deutsche Theologie,\" which preserve the quaintness of the original, and to Mrs. F. M. Brown, for her metrical version of Goethe's almost untranslatable lines, \"Ueber allen Gipfeln, ist Ruh,\" which form the keynote of the beautiful harmony in the character of the heroine.    G.P.U.   Chicago, November, 1874.     AUTHOR'S PREFACE.  Who has not, at some period of his life, seated himself at a writing-table, where, only a short time before, another sat, who now rests in the grave?  Who has not opened the drawers, which for long years have hidden the secrets of a heart now buried in the holy peace of the church-yard?  Here lie the letters which were so precious to him, the beloved one; here the pictures, ribbons, and books with marks on every leaf.  Who can now read and interpret them?  Who can gather again the withered and scattered leaves of this rose, and vivify them with fresh perfume?  The flames, in which the Greeks enveloped the bodies of the departed for the purpose of destruction; the flames, into which the ancients cast everything once dearest to the living, are now the securest repository for these relics.  With trembling fear the surviving friend reads the leaves no eye has ever seen, save those now so firmly closed, and if, after a glance, too hasty even to read them, he is convinced these letters and leaves contain nothing which men deem important, he throws them quickly upon the glowing coals--a flash and they are gone.  From such flames the following leaves have been saved.  They were at first intended only for the friends of the deceased, yet they have found friends even among strangers, and, since it is so to be, may wander anew in distant lands.  Gladly would the compiler have furnished more, but the leaves are too much scattered and mutilated to be rearranged and given complete.     FIRST MEMORY.  Childhood has its secrets and its mysteries; but who can tell or who can explain them!  We have all roamed through this silent wonder-wood--we have all once opened our eyes in blissful astonishment, as the beautiful reality of life overflowed our souls.  We knew not where, or who, we were--the whole world was ours and we were the whole world's.  That was an infinite life--without beginning and without end, without rest and without pain.  In the heart, it was as clear as the spring heavens, fresh as the violet's perfume--hushed and holy as a Sabbath morning.  What disturbs this God's-peace of the child?  How can this unconscious and innocent existence ever cease?  What dissipates the rapture of this individuality and universality, and suddenly leaves us solitary and alone in a clouded life?  Say not, with serious face.  It is sin!  Can even a child sin?  Say rather, we know not, and must only resign ourselves to it.  Is it sin, which makes the bud a blossom, and the blossom fruit, and the fruit dust?  Is it sin, which makes the worm a chrysalis, and the chrysalis a butterfly, and the butterfly dust?  And is it sin, which makes the child a man, and the man a gray-haired man, and the gray-haired man dust?  And what is dust?  Say rather, we know not, and must only resign ourselves to it.  Yet it is so beautiful, recalling the spring-time of life, to look back and remember one's self.  Yes, even in the sultry summer, in the melancholy autumn and in the cold winter of life, there is here and there a spring day, and the heart says: \"I feel like spring.\"  Such a day is this--and so I lay me down upon the soft moss of the fragrant woods, and stretch out my weary limbs, and look up, through the green foliage, into the boundless blue, and think how it used to be in that childhood.  Then, all seems forgotten.  The first pages of memory are like the old family Bible.  The first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled with handling.  But, when we turn further, and come to the chapters where Adam and Eve were banished from Paradise, then, all begins to grow clear and legible.  Now if we could only find the title-page with the imprint and date--but that is irrevocably lost, and, in their place, we find only the clear transcript--our baptismal certificate--bearing witness when we were born, the names of our parents and godparents, and that we were not issued _sine loco et anno_.  But, oh this beginning!  Would there were none, since, with the beginning, all thought and memories alike cease.  When we thus dream back into childhood, and from childhood into infinity, this bad beginning continually flies further away.  The thoughts pursue it and never overtake it; just as a child seeks the spot where the blue sky touches the earth, and runs and runs, while the sky always runs before it, yet still touches the earth--but the child grows weary and never reaches the spot.  But even since we were once there--wherever it may be, where we had a beginning, what do we know now?  For memory shakes itself like the spaniel, just come out of the waves, while the water runs in, his eyes and he looks very strangely.  I believe I can even yet remember when I saw the stars for the first time.  They may have seen me often before, but one evening it seemed as if it were cold.  Although I lay in my mother's lap, I shivered and was chilly, or I was frightened.  In short, something came over me which reminded me of my little Ego in no ordinary manner.  Then my mother showed me the bright stars, and I wondered at them, and thought that she had made them very beautifully.  Then I felt warm again, and could sleep well.  Furthermore, I remember how I once lay in the grass and everything about me tossed and nodded, hummed and buzzed.  Then there came a great swarm of little, myriad-footed, winged creatures, which lit upon my forehead and eyes and said, \"Good day.\"  Immediately my eyes smarted, and I cried to my mother, and she said: \"Poor little one, how the gnats have stung him!\"  I could not open my eyes or see the blue sky any longer, but my mother had a bunch of fresh violets in her hand, and it seemed as if a dark-blue, fresh, spicy perfume were wafted through my senses.  Even now, whenever I see the first violets, I remember this, and it seems to me that I must close my eyes so that the old dark-blue heaven of that day may again rise over my soul.  Still further do I remember, how, at another time, a new world disclosed itself to me--more beautiful than the star-world or the violet perfume.  It was on an Easter morning, and my mother had dressed me early.  Before the window stood our old church.  It was not beautiful, but still it had a lofty roof and tower, and on the tower a golden cross, and it appeared very much older and grayer than the other buildings.  I wondered who lived in it, and once I looked in through the iron-grated door.  It was entirely empty, cold and dismal.  There was not even one soul in the whole building, and after that I always shuddered when I passed the door.  But on this Easter morning, it had rained early, and when the sun came out in full splendor, the old church with the gray sloping roof, the high windows and the tower with the golden cross glistened with a wondrous shimmer.  All at once the light which streamed through the lofty windows began to move and glisten.  It was so intensely bright that one could have looked within, and as I closed my eyes the light entered my soul and therein everything seemed to shed brilliancy and perfume, to sing and to ring. It seemed to me a new life had commenced in myself and "]]]
