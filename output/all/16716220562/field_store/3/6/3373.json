[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14402"],["title","The Tale of Old Mr. Crow (#4)"],["body","that was the reason why he was often to be seen flying far down to the other end of the valley, over the village. There were many interesting sights there.  What Mr. Crow liked most of all was to watch the trains puffing along the railroad, which ran close to the river in that part of Pleasant Valley.  Sometimes he flew directly over the trains and raced with them. He often claimed that they were always trying to beat him. \"But they can't do it,\" he boasted.  At last there came a day when something happened that made Mr. Crow feel prouder than ever. He had gone down to the village, wearing his bright red coat. And a little way beyond the furthest house he perched in a tree by the side of the railroad and waited for the train to pass. He had heard it snorting at the station and he knew it was about to start.  Pretty soon the train came thundering up the track. And as soon as it reached him Mr. Crow started to race with it. He had no trouble in beating it, as he always did. And then he did something he had never done before. As soon as he had passed the engine he swooped down and flew right across the track in front of it.  All at once the train set up a terrible noise. It seemed to Mr. Crow that it ground its teeth. And it came to a sudden stop, hissing as if it were very angry.  Old Mr. Crow was the least bit startled. He alighted in the top of a tall elm. And while he watched, two men jumped down from the engine and walked along the track for a while.  Then they crawled back into the engine; and the train went slowly on again.  \"That's queer!\" said Mr. Crow to himself. \"I never saw that happen before. It looks to me as if the train was pretty angry because I beat it. And if that's the case, I'm coming back here to-morrow at the same hour and race the train again.\"  You can see just from that that Mr. Crow was something of a tease. All his life he had teased his neighbors. And now he felt more important than ever, because he thought he had found a way to tease a railroad train.     XIII  THE GAME OF CHECKERS   Mr. Crow told all his neighbors that he had made the train angry with him. And he invited everyone to come down to the village with him the following day, to enjoy the sport.  \"I'm going to race the train again,\" Mr. Crow explained. \"And I shall fly right in front of it, too--just as I did to-day. You'll see what a fuss it will make. And if you don't say it's a good joke, I'll never wear a checkered red coat again.\"  The next day Jasper Jay invited Mr. Crow to take part in a game of checkers. Whenever anybody in the neighborhood wanted to play checkers, he had to ask Mr. Crow, on account of having to use his checkered red coat for the board.  Mr. Crow accepted the invitation.  \"But I shall have to stop at exactly sixteen minutes past two,\" he said. \"The train starts from the village at half past two sharp; and I don't want to be late.\"  \"Very well!\" Jasper Jay agreed. \"I shall want to stop then myself, because I'm coming along with you to see the fun.\"  They had played twenty-seven games of checkers. And they were in the midst of the twenty-eighth when Mr. Crow suddenly cocked his eye at the sun.  \"Goodness!\" he exclaimed, springing up quickly. \"It's fifteen and a half minutes after two; and I shall have to be starting for the village.\" He reached for his checkered red coat, which was spread upon the ground between them.  \"Wait a moment!\" Jasper Jay cried. \"I'd suggest your leaving your coat right where it is. Then we can come back to our game after we've had our fun with the train. I'm going to win the game, so it's hardly fair not to finish it.\"  Now, Mr. Crow had not liked the idea of leaving his handsome red coat upon the ground. But he never could bear the thought of being beaten. And Jasper Jay's remark made him feel quite peevish.  \"I fully expect to win this game myself,\" the old gentleman said somewhat stiffly. \"So I'll leave my coat here as you suggest. But I shall have to go this instant, for I must stop at my house and get my yellow coat. Of course I can't go down to the village in my shirtsleeves.\"  He hurried away then, with Jasper Jay close behind him. And as soon as Mr. Crow had put on his bright yellow coat the two checker-players started for the village.  When Jasper and Mr. Crow reached the tree where the old gentleman had waited for the train the day before, they found as many as a dozen of their neighbors already there. Even as Mr. Crow dropped down upon a limb, he could hear the train coming up the track.  Mr. Crow's friends in the tree chose the best seats they could find, in order to get a good view of the race. And at the foot of the tree Jimmy Rabbit stood on tiptoe. He had often wished he could climb a tree--but never so much as then.     XIV  THE LUCKY LAUGH   As the train drew nearer to the tree where Mr. Crow and his friends were waiting, it gave a loud shriek.  \"You hear that?\" said Mr. Crow. \"It's still angry.\" And he shouted an impudent _caw-caw_ in reply.  In a moment more the race began. Mr. Crow had no trouble in beating the train, just as he always had. And when he had passed it he dropped quickly and swerved across the track ahead of it.  To his great surprise the train never faltered. It kept straight on, going faster and faster. And the first thing Mr. Crow knew, the last car had whipped around a curve and passed out of sight.  Poor Mr. Crow felt very downcast. He would have liked to hurry home at once, because he hated to face his friends. But he knew they would follow him if he flew away. So he went back to meet them, wearing a bold smile.  \"Did you see what happened?\" he inquired. \"The train was _afraid to stop_!\"  Everybody laughed when Mr. Crow said that. People knew him too well to be deceived by him.  \"I suppose your yellow coat frightened it,\" Jasper Jay jeered. \"It's too bad you didn't wear your checkered red one.\"  At that remark Jimmy Rabbit pricked up his long ears.  \"Did you wear your red coat yesterday?\" he asked Mr. Crow.  \"Yes!\" Mr. Crow replied gruffly. He did not like being questioned by a mere youngster like Jimmy Rabbit.  \"And you say the train stopped when you flew in front of it yesterday?\"  Mr. Crow grunted. But Jimmy Rabbit knew that he meant \"Yes!\"  \"That's it!\" Jimmy Rabbit cried. And he jumped up and down in his excitement.  \"That's what?\" asked Mr. Crow in a sulky tone.  \"I'll tell you!\" said Jimmy. \"Yesterday the train stopped because it saw your red coat. That's the way to stop a train. You wave a red flag or a red lantern at a train and it will always stop. But I've noticed that a train pays no attention to any other color. Now, you could wave something green, or yellow, or blue in front of a train; and no matter how hard you waved, it would go right on as if it never saw you at all.\"  \"Maybe you know,\" Mr. Crow snapped. \"And maybe you don't. I said the train was afraid to stop. And I still think so.\"  Jimmy Rabbit winked at the crowd in the tree.  \"I must hop along now,\" he told them. \"I'm glad I came to see the race, for it has been even more fun than I expected.\"  Then Jasper Jay gave Mr. Crow a great start.  \"It's too bad--\" he said--\"it's too bad you can't wear your red coat any more, Mr. Crow.\"  \"How's that?\" asked Mr. Crow quickly.  \"You promised that if we didn't say it was a good joke you'd never wear a checkered red coat again.\"  Now, Mr. Crow had forgotten all about that remark. And for a moment he looked worried. Then he turned cheerful all at once.  \"Look here!\" he cried. \"When I came back to this tree you all laughed, didn't you?\"  Everybody admitted that.  \"Then there must have been a good joke somewhere,\" Mr. Crow said. \"And I shall wear my red coat as often as I please.\"  No one really cared, anyhow, whether he did or whether he didn't. But Mr. Crow was angry with Jasper Jay. And he refused to finish the game of checkers with him.     XV  MR. CROW'S NEW COAT   When Mr. Crow decided, one fall, that he would stay in Pleasant Valley during the winter, instead of going South, he remembered at once that he would need a thick overcoat.  That was when he went to Mr. Frog's tailor's shop, for Mr. Frog, you know, was a tailor.  \"I want you to make me a warm overcoat.\" Mr. Crow told him. \"Can you do it?\"  \"Certainly!\" said Mr. Frog. \"You've come to the right place. Everybody says that I'm the best tailor in Pleasant Valley.\" And that was quite true--because he was the _only_ one. \"What'll you have--stripes, checks, or spots?\" Mr. Frog asked briskly.  \"What do you suggest?\" Mr. Crow replied. He had not thought much about his new coat--except that he wanted it to be warm.  \"Spots, by all means!\" said Mr. Frog. \"I always wear 'em myself. They're the best, to my mind. For if you happen to get a spot on your coat, what's one spot more?\"  \"That's a good idea,\" Mr. Crow said. \"And how much will you ask to make me a spotted coat?\"  \"I charge by the spot,\" said Mr. Frog. \"The more spots, the more the coat will cost. So I'd advise you to take a coat with large spots, because there'll be fewer of 'em and the price will be less.\"  \"That's a good idea, too,\" said old Mr. Crow. \"You may make my coat of this!\" He pointed to a piece of blue cloth with yellow spots about the size of a dollar and a quarter.  \"Good!\" said Mr. Frog. Then he measured Mr. Crow. And then he measured the cloth. And then he scratched some figures on a flat stone. \"There'll be thirteen spots on your coat and that'll make just thirteen that you'll owe me.\"  \"Thirteen what?\" asked Mr. Crow.  \"Ah! That's the question!\" said Mr. Frog, mysteriously. \"I'll tell you when your coat's finished. And you can pay me then. It's what is known as 'spot cash,'\" he added.  \"Very well!\" Mr. Crow answered. \"And I'll come back--\"  \"To-morrow!\" said the tailor.  When to-morrow came, Mr. Crow flew over to the pond where Mr. Frog had his tailor's shop. And that spry gentleman slipped Mr. Crow's new coat upon him. While Mr. Crow stood stiffly in the middle of the floor Mr. Frog pulled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14402"],["title","The Tale of Old Mr. Crow (#5)"],["body"," coat here and patted it there. He backed away and looked at it, with his head on one side; and then he stood on his head and looked at it, with his legs dangling in the air.  \"It's a perfect fit,\" he assured Mr. Crow, finally. And then he caught up a needle and thread and busied himself behind Mr. Crow's back for a long time.  \"What are you doing?\" Mr. Crow inquired at last. \"I'm getting tired of standing still.\"  \"Just fixing it!\" answered Mr. Frog. \"It'll be finished in a minute.\"  And it was. He stuck his needle into Mr. Crow, to let him know it was done.  Mr. Crow jumped half way across the room. \"Why did you do that?\" he asked hotly.  \"I wanted to break my thread,\" Mr. Frog explained pleasantly. \"It's the quickest way of breaking a thread that I know of.\"  \"You look out, or I'll break something else for you,\" Mr. Crow squawked, for he was thoroughly enraged. \"And now,\" he added, \"I'll pay you what I owe before leaving. I owe thirteen of something.\"  Then Mr. Frog surprised him.  \"I've decided not to take any pay,\" he announced. \"I hear that thirteen is an unlucky number.\"  \"Is that so?\" Mr. Frog exclaimed. \"Perhaps it is. If you had stuck your needle into me thirteen times it certainly would have been unlucky for you.\"  On the whole Mr. Crow was well pleased with his bargain. He was glad that he had asked Mr. Frog to make a coat for him. Indeed, if only the tailor had not stabbed him with his needle, he would have returned to the shop at once and ordered Mr. Frog to make him a pair of trousers--with thirteen spots on them.     XVI  A TIGHT FIT   Now, a certain thing happened that made Mr. Crow change his mind about staying North for the winter. It had something to do with nuts, and Frisky Squirrel, and Sandy Chipmunk. But that is another story; and you may already have heard it.  Anyhow, Mr. Crow suddenly decided that he would have to fly southward, after all. He was disappointed, because he didn't like the thought of having to make so long a journey. Moreover, he had his new blue coat with the yellow spots, which Mr. Frog had made for him. It was a handsome coat. And everybody said it was very becoming to Mr. Crow. But he knew it was altogether too warm to wear to his home in the South where the weather was sure to be mild.  \"I'll have to leave my new coat behind,\" he said to himself in a sad voice. \"It's almost too heavy to wear even here, though it is fall. I hate to do it; but I'd better take it off and hide it somewhere. There might be some cold days next spring when I'd be glad of a thick, warm coat.\"  So the old gentleman started to unbutton his new coat, which he had worn all day, ever since Mr. Frog had slipped it on him early in the morning. Anyone might think that it would have been an easy matter to unbutton the coat, for Mr. Frog had sewed a double row of big brown buttons down the front of it. But for some time Mr. Crow fumbled with one of them in vain.  \"Ha!\" he exclaimed at last. \"This is stupid of me! I'm trying to unbutton the wrong row of buttons.\" Then he fumbled with one of the buttons of the other row. But strange to say, he was no more successful than before. He struggled with all the buttons in that row (there were five of them). And then he tried the other five, one after another.  Mr. Crow couldn't understand it. He wanted more than ever to take the coat off, because his efforts to unbutton it had made him quite warm.  \"I shall have get somebody to help me,\" he said at last. \"It may be that my eyesight is failing--though I haven't noticed before that there was anything the matter with it.... There's my cousin, Jasper Jay! I'll ask him to unbutton my coat.\" And he called to Jasper, who had just alighted on a stump not far away.  To Mr. Crow's dismay, his cousin refused to assist him.  \"I know you too well,\" said Jasper Jay. \"You want to play some trick on me. If the buttons were on the back of your coat I might help you. But they're right in front of you; and they're so big that a blind person couldn't help finding them, even on the darkest night.... No! You can't fool me this time!\"  \"Very well!\" Mr. Crow croaked. \"If you won't help me, there are plenty of other people who'll be glad to.\" And he flew away in something very like a temper.  To Mr. Crow's surprise he couldn't find anyone that would unbutton his new coat for him; like Jasper Jay, everybody was afraid that Mr. Crow meant to play a trick on him.  Mr. Crow was beginning to be frightened. He had called on all his friends in Pleasant Valley except one. And if that one should refuse, Mr. Crow didn't know what he could do. He had liked his spotted coat. But now he began to hate it. And he wanted to slip out of it and never see it again.  So Mr. Crow hurried over to the swamp where Fatty Coon lived.     XVII  THE STRANGE BUTTONS   To Mr. Crow's delight, it did not occur to Fatty Coon that Mr. Crow might be playing a trick on him. You see, as was usually the case, Fatty was hungry. And he had no thought for anything except food. When Mr. Crow explained what a fix he was in, and asked Fatty to unbutton his coat for him, Fatty stepped up to him at once.  But he didn't try to unbutton the coat. He sniffed at the buttons, while his face wore a puzzled look. And then he began to smile.  \"I'll tell you what I'll do!\" Fatty said. \"If you'll give me these buttons, I'll take them off for you. And then, of course, you'll have no more trouble with your coat. You can throw it off any time you please.\"  \"Good!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"The buttons shall be yours. I don't want them, for I shall never wear this coat again.\"  So Fatty Coon set to work to take off the buttons. He removed them in a very odd way, too. Instead of tearing them off he began eating them!  \"Goodness!\" Mr. Crow cried. \"Aren't you afraid you'll be ill?\"  But Fatty Coon never answered. He kept on nibbling the buttons and crunching them in his mouth. And he never stopped until he had swallowed the very last one.  Then he smacked his lips (for he knew no better).  \"Those were the finest gingersnaps I ever tasted,\" he remarked. \"It's a pity there weren't a baker's dozen of them, instead of only ten.\"  Old Mr. Crow nearly fell over, he was so surprised. He had never dreamed that those big brown buttons, which Mr. Frog had sewed upon his coat, were nothing but gingersnaps.  \"If I'd known that I would have eaten them myself!\" he exclaimed. \"But I don't care. Now that I can get out of this heavy coat, I'm satisfied.\"  But to Mr. Crow's dismay, the coat clung round him as tightly as ever. He couldn't throw it open at all. And he turned the least bit pale.  \"This is strange!\" he murmured. \"What can be the matter, I wonder!\"  Fatty Coon looked at the coat again. And then he laughed.  \"The trouble--\" he said--\"the trouble is, there are no buttonholes! Your coat doesn't open in front. And it doesn't open anywhere else, either. It's _sewed on you_, Mr. Crow.\"  Poor Mr. Crow began to feel faint. He leaned against a tree and did not speak for some time. But he was thinking deeply. And all at once he understood what had happened.  \"It's all the fault of that silly tailor, Mr. Frog!\" he groaned. \"He made me stand still a long time. And that was when he sewed my coat up the back.... What can I do?\" he asked helplessly.  \"If I were you I'd go straight to Mr. Frog's shop and make him take the stitches out,\" Fatty Coon said. \"And if he has any more of those gingersnaps, I wish you'd let me know.\"     XVIII  AN UNLUCKY NUMBER   As soon as old Mr. Crow pushed open the door of Mr. Frog's tailor's shop, Mr. Frog jumped up quickly. He had been sitting cross-legged upon a table, sewing. And when he leaped off the table he sprang so high that his head struck the ceiling.  \"What's that noise?\" Mr. Crow asked him nervously, when Mr. Frog had landed upon his feet. \"It sounded like thunder; but there's not a cloud in the sky.\"  \"It was my head,\" Mr. Frog explained. \"It hit the ceiling, you know.\"  \"Oh!\" said Mr. Crow. \"It made a very hollow sound. But I am not surprised. I have already learned that your head is quite empty.\"  \"It's certainly not solid,\" Mr. Frog agreed pleasantly. No matter what happened, he never lost his temper.  But Mr. Crow was different. _He_ was angry.  \"You've got me into a pretty fix!\" said he. \"And now you must get me out of it.\"  \"I suppose you want more buttons,\" Mr. Prog observed. \"I noticed as you came in that you had lost every one.\"  \"No!\" Mr. Crow told him. \"What I want is to get out of this coat. I've decided to spend the winter in the South, after all. And here you've been and gone and sewed the coat on me, and left me no way at all to slip out of it.\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" the tailor replied politely. \"Pardon _me_--but I think you are mistaken. I left four openings through which anyone could crawl out.\"  Old Mr. Crow looked puzzled.  \"I should like to know where they are,\" he said.  \"The neck, the skirts, and the two sleeves!\" Mr. Frog told him.  At that Mr. Crow looked at him severely.  \"How could you expect me to slip through any of those places?\" he asked.  \"Why--\" said the tailor--\"I thought it would be easy for you. I've always heard you were a very slippery customer.\"  When he said that, Mr. Crow made some queer noises in his throat, much as if he were choking.  \"Are you ill?\" the tailor cried.  \"Just a frog in my throat!\" Mr. Crow answered.  As he said that. Mr. Frog leaped toward the door. He was a jumpy sort of person. When anything startled him you could never tell in what direction he might spring. And he was now about to rush out of his shop when Mr. Crow caught him and dragged him back.  \"You can't go,\" he shouted, \"until you've taken the stitches out of the back of my coat.\"  \"Oh, certainly!\" Mr. Frog quavered. And he set to work at once to open the back seam of Mr. Crow's coat.  He was a spry worker--was Mr. Frog. In less time than it takes to tell it he had ripped the back of the coat from collar to hem.  And old Mr. Crow was no less spry in pulling"]]]
