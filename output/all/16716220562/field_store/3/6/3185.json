Seven test cases were argued together in the Supreme Court, five days in all being devoted to the argument. It will be of interest to note some of the reasons advanced against the validity of the amendment, as they are summarized in the official report.[1]  [Footnote 1: National Prohibition cases, 253 U.S., 350.]  The Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island argued[1] that:       The amendment is an invasion of the sovereignty of the      complaining state and her people, not contemplated by the      amending clause of the Constitution. The amending power ... is      not a substantive power but a precautionary safeguard inserted      incidentally to insure the ends set forth in that instrument      against errors and oversights committed in its formation.      Amendments, as the term indeed implies, are to be limited to      the correction of such errors....       It is \"This Constitution\" that may be amended. \"This      Constitution\" is not a code of transient laws but a framework      of government and an embodiment of fundamental principles. By      an amendment, the identity or purpose of the instrument is      not to be changed; its defects may be cured, but \"This      Constitution\" must remain. It would be the greatest absurdity      to contend that there was a purpose to create a limited      government and at the same time to confer upon that government      a power to do away with its own limitations.  [Footnote 1: Id., pp. 354-356.]  The Attorney General of the State of New Jersey:[1]       attacked the amendment as an invasion of state sovereignty not      authorized by the amending clause and as not, properly      speaking, an amendment, but legislation, revolutionary in      character.  [Footnote 1: 253 U.S., pp. 356-357.]  The eminent Chicago lawyer, Levy Mayer, and ex-Solicitor General William Marshall Bullitt, contended,[1] among other things, that       the power of \"amendment\" contained in Art. V does not      authorize the invasion of the sovereign powers expressly      reserved to the states and the people by the Ninth and Tenth      Amendments, except with the consent of _all_ the states....       If amendment under Art. V were unlimited, three-fourths of the      legislatures would have it in their power to establish a state      religion and prohibit free exercise of other religious      beliefs; to quarter a standing army in the houses of citizens;      to do away with trial by jury and republican form of      government; to repeal the provision for a president; and to      abolish this court and with it the whole judicial power      vested by the Constitution.  [Footnote 1: Id., pp. 357-361.]  Elihu Root, preï¤©inent as a constitutional lawyer, appeared as counsel in one of the test cases. His main contention was summarized in his brief as follows:[1]       (a) That the authority to amend the Constitution is a      continuance of the constitution-making power and as such is a      power quite different and altogether distinct from the      law-making power under the Constitution.       (b) That a grant of the one power does not include or imply a      grant of the other.       (c) That the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in      Article V of the Constitution [the article providing for      amendment] limits the power granted to the function of      constitution-making as distinguished from ordinary law-making.       (d) That the purposes of the grant imply the same limitation.       (e) That other parts of the Constitution--notably Article      I--express the same limitation.       (f) That the existence of authority under Article V to enact      ordinary laws regulating the conduct of private citizens under      color of amendment, would be so in conflict with the      fundamental principles and spirit of the Constitution that      such a construction is not permissible.  [Footnote 1: For the Reporter's Summary see 253 U.S., pp. 361-367.]  There were other arguments of a more technical character. Article V of the Constitution provides that the Congress shall propose amendments \"whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary.\" It was urged that this required the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the entire membership of both Houses, and that two-thirds of a quorum was not sufficient. It was also urged that the proposal was fatally defective because it did not on its face declare that both Houses deemed the amendment necessary. It was also argued that the amendment had not been effectively ratified in certain of the states where it had been approved by the state legislature (notably Ohio) because under the constitutions of those states it was subject to a referendum to the people before becoming effective. The Supreme Court of Ohio had so decided[1] and a referendum had actually been held in that state, resulting in a rejection of the amendment by popular vote. Various arguments were also advanced based on the puzzling phraseology of Section 2 of the amendment that \"the Congress and the several States shall have _concurrent power_ to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\" The eminent constitutional lawyer, W.D. Guthrie, addressed himself particularly to this phase of the controversy.[2] It was urged with much force that the effect of these words was to save the rights of the states, in respect of intrastate matters, by requiring their concurrence in any legislation of Congress regulating such matters.  [Footnote 1: See _Hawke v. Smith_, 253 U.S., 221.]  [Footnote 2: 253 U.S., pp. 368-380.]  All the arguments advanced were alike unavailing. The nine members of the Supreme Court were unanimous in sustaining the validity of the amendment, holding that it \"by lawful proposal and ratification, has become a part of the Constitution, and must be respected and given effect the same as other provisions of that instrument.\"[1] The Court, however, adopted the very unusual course of deciding the various cases before it (affirming four, reversing one, and dismissing the original bills filed by the states of Rhode Island and New Jersey) without any written opinion. Speaking through Mr. Justice Van Devanter, the Court merely announced its conclusions. This was an unprecedented procedure in a case involving constitutional questions of such importance. It drew criticism from some of the members of the Court itself. Chief Justice White said:[2]       I profoundly regret that in a case of this magnitude,      affecting as it does an amendment to the Constitution dealing      with the powers and duties of the national and state      governments, and intimately concerning the welfare of the      whole people, the court has deemed it proper to state only      ultimate conclusions without an exposition of the reasoning by      which they have been reached.  and proceeded to announce the reasons which had actuated him personally. Justice McKenna said:[3]       The court declares conclusions only, without giving any      reasons for them. The instance may be wise--establishing a      precedent now, hereafter wisely to be imitated. It will      undoubtedly decrease the literature of the court if it does      not increase lucidity.  [Footnote 1: Id., p. 386.]  [Footnote 2: Id., p. 388.]  [Footnote 3: 253 U.S., p. 393.]  Perhaps a hint as to the reasons actuating the majority of the Court may be found in the brief concurring memorandum of Mr. Justice McReynolds. He said:[1]       I do not dissent from the disposition of these causes as      ordered by the Court, but confine my concurrence to that. It      is impossible now to say with fair certainty what construction      should be given to the Eighteenth Amendment. Because of the      bewilderment which it creates, a multitude of questions will      inevitably arise and demand solution here. In the      circumstances, I prefer to remain free to consider these      questions when they arrive.  [Footnote 1: Id., p. 392.]  Justices McKenna and Clarke dissented from portions of the decision dealing with the question of the proper construction of the grant of \"concurrent power\" to Congress and the States, and wrote opinions setting forth the grounds of their dissent. Both Justices, however, concurred in affirming the validity of the amendment.  Thus the legal battle was fought and lost. The amendment had withstood attack and men's minds settled back to the practical question of its enforcement.  Upon that question, however difficult and interesting, we do not here enter. Our present concern is to ascertain as nearly as may be the true place of the amendment in the development of American constitutional law.  That it affords startling evidence of a radical departure from the views of the founders of the Republic is beyond question. Such a blow at the prerogatives of the states, such a step toward centralization, would have been thought impossible by the men of 1787. It would be a mistake, however, to view the departure as having originated with this amendment. Rather is the amendment to be regarded as merely a spectacular manifestation of a change which was already well under way.  In the early days of the Republic the dominating purpose was the protection of state prerogatives, so far as that was compatible with the common safety. The first eleven amendments of the Federal Constitution were all limitations upon federal power. Not until the people of the various states had been drawn together and taught to think in terms of the nation by a great Civil War was there any amendment which enlarged the powers of the National Government. The three post-war amendments (Nos. XIII, XIV, and XV) marked a distinct expansion of federal power but one that seemed to find its justification, as it found its origin, in the necessity for effectuating the purposes of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14104"],["title","Our Changing Constitution (#6)"],["body","and protecting the newly enfranchised Negroes.  A long period of seeming inactivity, more than forty years, elapsed before another constitutional amendment was adopted.[1] The inaction, however, was apparent rather than real. As matter of fact, a change was all the time going on. In a very real sense the Constitution was being altered almost from year to year. That the alterations did not take the shape of formal written amendments was largely due to the tradition of constitutional immobility. The idea had grown up that the machinery of amendment provided by the Fathers was so slow and cumbersome that it was impossible as a practical matter to secure a change by that method except under stress of war or great popular excitement. That idea is now exploded. We of to-day know better, having seen the Income Tax Amendment (No. XVI), the Election of Senators by Popular Vote Amendment (No. XVII), the Prohibition Amendment (No. XVIII), and the Woman Suffrage Amendment (No. XIX) go through within a period of seven years. For generations, however, the tradition of constitutional immobility held sway and the forces of change worked through channels that seemed easier and less obstructed.  [Footnote 1: No. XVI, the Income Tax Amendment, ratified in 1913.]  The principal channel has been congressional legislation. Congress has found ways of reaching by indirection objects which could not be approached directly. Under the express grants of power contained in the Constitution statutes have been enacted which were really designed to accomplish some ulterior object. A striking example is found in the child labor laws, discussed more at length in a subsequent chapter. Congress at first sought to regulate child labor by a statute enacted ostensibly as a regulation of commerce under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held the Act unconstitutional as exceeding the commerce power of Congress and invading the powers reserved to the states.[1] Thereupon Congress practically reæ³acted it, coupled with a provision for a prohibitive tax on the profits of concerns employing child labor, as part of a revenue act enacted under the constitutional grant of power to lay taxes.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Hammer v. Dagenhart_, 247 U.S., 251.]  [Footnote 2: Revenue Act of 1918, Title XII.]  The assumption by the National Government of jurisdiction over the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is no more of an encroachment on the prerogatives of the states than is its assumption of jurisdiction over child labor and the use of narcotic drugs. We come back, therefore, to the proposition that the Prohibition Amendment is to be regarded less as a departure in American fundamental law than as a spectacular manifestation of a change already well under way.  The change, however much students of our institutions may deplore it, is not difficult to explain. The earlier solicitude for state rights was in a sense accidental. It was based on sentiment and mutual jealousies among the colonies rather than on any fundamental differences in race, beliefs, or material interests. The traditions behind it, while strong, were of comparatively recent growth. When they entered the Union the colonies were still new and undeveloped. As men died and their sons succeeded them prejudices gradually yielded and sentiment changed. Moreover, various other forces--immigration, free trade among the states, the growth of railways and other nationwide industries, foreign wars--have been at work to obliterate state lines.  Advocates of the old order see in the change a breaking down of the principle of local self-government. To their minds the danger of majority tyranny, made possible by a centralization of power in a republic of such vast extent and varied interests, outweighs all the advantages of national uniformity and efficiency. Advocates of the new order think otherwise. They argue, moreover, that the states have become too great and populous to serve as units for purposes of home rule; that their boundaries are for the most part artificial and correspond to no real distinctions in the ordinary life of men. They assert that the instinct for local self-government remains as strong as it ever was, and instance the resentment of New York City over interference from Albany.  The average man gives little thought to the constitutional aspect of the controversy. His interest in the prohibition movement is focused on other features which seem to him of more immediate concern. And yet, did he but realize it, the constitutional aspect transcends all the others in its importance for the future welfare and happiness of himself, his children, and his country.     V  THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT   A prudent man touches the question of woman suffrage gingerly. Many fingers have been burnt in that fire and its embers are not yet dead. Some mention of the Nineteenth Amendment seems necessary, however, in any discussion of federal encroachment on state power, and it may be possible to approach the suffrage movement from the standpoint of constitutional law without getting upon controversial ground.  The United States Constitution as originally adopted did not prescribe who should be entitled to vote. That matter was left entirely in the hands of the states. The Constitution provided[1] that, for the election of members of the House of Representatives, \"the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\" It was further provided that Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states[2] and that the President and Vice-president should be chosen by presidential electors appointed in such manner as the state legislatures might direct.[3] These were the only elective federal officials.  [Footnote 1: Article I, Section 2.]  [Footnote 2: Article I, Section 3.]  [Footnote 3: Article II, Section 1.]  While the states were thus left in full control, it does not follow that the matter was deemed wholly outside the proper scope of national authority. No argument is necessary to demonstrate that the regulation of the suffrage in national elections is or may be a matter of national concern. The question of prescribing the qualifications of voters in such elections was much debated in the Convention which framed the Constitution.[1] Some members were in favor of prescribing a property qualification and limiting the suffrage to freeholders. It was finally decided, however, to accept the qualifications prescribed by state law. In adopting this plan the Convention followed the line of least resistance. The qualifications of voters in the various states differed.[2] Most states required a property qualification, but some did not. It was felt that to attempt to impose a uniform rule on all the states would arouse opposition and create one more obstacle to be overcome in the formidable task of getting the Constitution ratified.  [Footnote 1: See e.g., Farrand, \"Records of the Federal Convention,\" Vol. II, p. 201 et seq.]  [Footnote 2: For a statement of the qualifications in the various states see _Minor v. Happersett_, 21 Wall., 162.]  There the matter rested, with suffrage qualifications regulated entirely by state law, until after the Civil War. Meanwhile, the states had been abolishing property tests, and universal male suffrage had been written into state constitutions. The cry for woman suffrage had begun, but as yet it was only a still small voice, inaudible to legislators.  After the Civil War the problem of protecting the emancipated slaves had to be dealt with, and three constitutional amendments (Nos. XIII, XIV, and XV) were adopted with that end primarily in view. Number XIII, ratified in 1865, formally abolished slavery. Number XIV, ratified in 1868, extended citizenship to all persons born in the United States and provided (among other things) that no state should abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. Number XV, ratified in 1870, provided that \"the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" Here was the entering wedge of federal interference. The amendments did not purport to deal with woman suffrage, but the pioneers of the suffrage movement thought they discovered in them a means of advancing their cause and lost no time in putting the matter to the test. Susan B. Anthony voted at Rochester, N.Y., in an election for a representative in Congress, claiming that the restriction of voting to males by the constitution and laws of New York was void as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment providing that \"no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" She was indicted for voting unlawfully, and on her trial before Justice Hunt of the United States Supreme Court, sitting at Circuit, the Court directed the jury to find a verdict of guilty and imposed a fine of $100 and costs.[1]  [Footnote 1: _United States v. Anthony_, 11 Blatchford, 200.]  Mrs. Virginia Minor raised a similar question in the courts of Missouri. The Missouri constitution limited the right to vote to male citizens. Mrs. Minor applied for registration as a voter, and on being refused brought suit against the Registrar of Voters on the ground that this clause of the Missouri constitution was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Missouri state courts decided against her, and the case was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States where the decision of the state courts was affirmed.[1] The Supreme Court held in effect that while Mrs. Minor was a citizen that fact alone did not make her a voter; that suffrage was not coextensive with citizenship, either when the Constitution was adopted or at the date of the Fourteenth Amendment, and was not one of the \"privileges and"]]]
