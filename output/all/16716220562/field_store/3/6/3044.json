For Columbine, the most interesting moment of this incident was when the mustang raised his head to look at his legs, in order to see what had been done to them. There was something almost human in that look. It expressed intelligence and fear and fury.  The cowboys released his legs and let him get up. Whang stamped his iron-shod hoofs.  \"It was a mean trick, Whang,\" said Columbine. \"If I owned you that'd never be done to you.\"  \"I reckon you can have him fer the askin',\" said Jim, as he threw on the saddle. \"Nobody but me can ride him. Do you want to try?\"  \"Not in these clothes,\" replied Columbine, laughing.  \"Wal, Miss Collie, you're shore dressed up fine to-day, fer some reason or other,\" said Lem, shaking his head, while he gathered up the tools from the ground.  \"Ahuh! An' here comes the reason,\" exclaimed Jim, in low, hoarse whisper.  Columbine heard the whisper and at the same instant a sharp footfall on the gravel road. She quickly turned, almost losing her balance. And she recognized Jack Belllounds. The boy Buster Jack she remembered so well was approaching, now a young man, taller, heavier, older, with paler face and bolder look. Columbine had feared this meeting, had prepared herself for it. But all she felt when it came was annoyance at the fact that he had caught her sitting on top of the corral fence, with little regard for dignity. It did not occur to her to jump down. She merely sat straight, smoothed down her skirt, and waited.  Jim led the mustang out of the corral and Lem followed. It looked as if they wanted to avoid the young man, but he prevented that.  \"Howdy, boys! I'm Jack Belllounds,\" he said, rather loftily. But his manner was nonchalant. He did not offer to shake hands.  Jim mumbled something, and Lem said, \"Hod do.\"  \"That's an ornery--looking bronc,\" went on Belllounds, and he reached with careless hand for the mustang. Whang jerked so hard that he pulled Jim half over.  \"Wal, he ain't a bronc, but I reckon he's all the rest.\" drawled Jim.  Both cowboys seemed slow, careless. They were neither indifferent nor responsive. Columbine saw their keen, steady glances go over Belllounds. Then she took a second and less hasty look at him. He wore high-heeled, fancy-topped boots, tight-fitting trousers of dark material, a heavy belt with silver buckle, and a white, soft shirt, with wide collar, open at the neck. He was bareheaded.  \"I'm going to run White Slides,\" he said to the cowboys. \"What're your names?\"  Columbine wanted to giggle, which impulse she smothered. The idea of any one asking Jim his name! She had never been able to find out.  \"My handle is Lemuel Archibawld Billings,\" replied Lem, blandly. The middle name was an addition no one had ever heard.  Belllounds then directed his glance and steps toward the girl. The cowboys dropped their heads and shuffled on their way.  \"There's only one girl on the ranch,\" said Belllounds, \"so you must be Columbine.\"  \"Yes. And you're Jack,\" she replied, and slipped off the fence. \"I'm glad to welcome you home.\"  She offered her hand, and he held it until she extricated it. There was genuine surprise and pleasure in his expression.  \"Well, I'd never have known you,\" he said, surveying her from head to foot. \"It's funny. I had the clearest picture of you in mind. But you're not at all like I imagined. The Columbine I remember was thin, white-faced, and all eyes.\"  \"It's been a long time. Seven years,\" she replied. \"But I knew you. You're older, taller, bigger, but the same Buster Jack.\"  \"I hope not,\" he said, frankly condemning that former self. \"Dad needs me. He wants me to take charge here--to be a man. I'm back now. It's good to be home. I never was worth much. Lord! I hope I don't disappoint him again.\"  \"I hope so, too,\" she murmured. To hear him talk frankly, seriously, like this counteracted the unfavorable impression she had received. He seemed earnest. He looked down at the ground, where he was pushing little pebbles with the toe of his boot. She had a good opportunity to study his face, and availed herself of it. He did look like his father, with his big, handsome head, and his blue eyes, bolder perhaps from their prominence than from any direct gaze or fire. His face was pale, and shadowed by worry or discontent. It seemed as though a repressed character showed there. His mouth and chin were undisciplined. Columbine could not imagine that she despised anything she saw in the features of this young man. Yet there was something about him that held her aloof. She had made up her mind to do her part unselfishly. She would find the best in him, like him for it, be strong to endure and to help. Yet she had no power to control her vague and strange perceptions. Why was it that she could not feel in him what she liked in Jim Montana or Lem or Wilson Moore?  \"This was my second long stay away from home,\" said Belllounds. \"The first was when I went to school in Kansas City. I liked that. I was sorry when they turned me out--sent me home.... But the last three years were hell.\"  His face worked, and a shade of dark blood rippled over it.  \"Did you work?\" queried Columbine.  \"Work! It was worse than work.... Sure I worked,\" he replied.  Columbine's sharp glance sought his hands. They looked as soft and unscarred as her own. What kind of work had he done, if he told the truth?  \"Well, if you work hard for dad, learn to handle the cowboys, and never take up those old bad habits--\"  \"You mean drink and cards? I swear I'd forgotten them for three years--until yesterday. I reckon I've the better of them.\"  \"Then you'll make dad and me happy. You'll be happy, too.\"  Columbine thrilled at the touch of fineness coming out in him. There was good in him, whatever the mad, wild pranks of his boyhood.  \"Dad wants us to marry,\" he said, suddenly, with shyness and a strange, amused smile. \"Isn't that funny? You and me--who used to fight like cat and dog! Do you remember the time I pushed you into the old mud-hole? And you lay in wait for me, behind the house, to hit me with a rotten cabbage?\"  \"Yes, I remember,\" replied Columbine, dreamily. \"It seems so long ago.\"  \"And the time you ate my pie, and how I got even by tearing off your little dress, so you had to run home almost without a stitch on?\"  \"Guess I've forgotten that,\" replied Columbine, with a blush. \"I must have been very little then.\"  \"You were a little devil.... Do you remember the fight I had with Moore--about you?\"  She did not answer, for she disliked the fleeting expression that crossed his face. He remembered too well.  \"I'll settle that score with Moore,\" he went on. \"Besides, I won't have him on the ranch.\"  \"Dad needs good hands,\" she said, with her eyes on the gray sage slopes. Mention of Wilson Moore augmented the aloofness in her. An annoyance pricked along her veins.  \"Before we get any farther I'd like to know something. Has Moore ever made love to you?\"  Columbine felt that prickling augment to a hot, sharp wave of blood. Why was she at the mercy of strange, quick, unfamiliar sensations? Why did she hesitate over that natural query from Jack Belllounds?  \"No. He never has,\" she replied, presently.  \"That's damn queer. You used to like him better than anybody else. You sure hated me.... Columbine, have you outgrown that?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" she answered. \"But I hardly hated you.\"  \"Dad said you were willing to marry me. Is that so?\"  Columbine dropped her head. His question, kindly put, did not affront her, for it had been expected. But his actual presence, the meaning of his words, stirred in her an unutterable spirit of protest. She had already in her will consented to the demand of the old man; she was learning now, however, that she could not force her flesh to consent to a surrender it did not desire.  \"Yes, I'm willing,\" she replied, bravely.  \"Soon?\" he flashed, with an eager difference in his voice.  \"If I had my way it'd not be--too soon,\" she faltered. Her downcast eyes had seen the stride he had made closer to her, and she wanted to run.  \"Why? Dad thinks it'd be good for me,\" went on Belllounds, now, with strong, self-centered thought. \"It'd give me responsibility. I reckon I need it. Why not soon?\"  \"Wouldn't it be better to wait awhile?\" she asked. \"We do not know each other--let alone care--\"  \"Columbine, I've fallen in love with you.\" he declared, hotly.  \"Oh, how could you!\" cried Columbine, incredulously.  \"Why, I always was moony over you--when we were kids,\" he said. \"And now to meet you grown up like this--so pretty and sweet--such a--a healthy, blooming girl.... And dad's word that you'd be my wife soon--_mine_--why, I just went off my head at sight of you.\"  Columbine looked up at him and was reminded of how, as a boy, he had always taken a quick, passionate longing for things he must and would have. And his father had not denied him. It might really be that Jack had suddenly fallen in love with her.  \"Would you want to take me without my--my love?\" she asked, very low. \"I don't love you now. I might some time, if you were good--if you made dad happy--if you conquered--\"  \"Take you! I'd take you if you--if you hated me,\" he replied, now in the grip of passion.  \"I'll tell dad how I feel,\" she said, faintly, \"and--and marry you when he says.\"  He kissed her, would have embraced her had she not put him back.  \"Don't! Some--some one will see.\"  \"Columbine, we're engaged,\" he asserted, with a laugh of possession. \"Say, you needn't look so white and scared. I won't eat you. But I'd like to.... Oh, you're a sweet girl! Here I was hating to come home. And look at my luck!\"  Then with a sudden change, that seemed significant of his character, he lost his ardor, dropped the half-bold, half-masterful air, and showed the softer side.  \"Collie, I never was any good,\" he said. \"But I want to be better. I'll prove it. I'll make a clean breast of everything. I won't marry you with any secret between us. You might find out afterward and hate me.... Do you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],["title","The Mysterious Rider (#6)"],["body","any idea where I've been these last three years?\"  \"No,\" answered Columbine.  \"I'll tell you right now. But you must promise never to mention it to any one--or throw it up to me--ever.\"  He spoke hoarsely, and had grown quite white. Suddenly Columbine thought of Wilson Moore! He had known where Jack had spent those years. He had resisted a strong temptation to tell her. That was as noble in him as the implication of Jack's whereabouts had been base.  \"Jack, that is big of you,\" she replied, hurriedly. \"I respect you--like you for it. But you needn't tell me. I'd rather you didn't. I'll take the will for the deed.\"  Belllounds evidently experienced a poignant shock of amaze, of relief, of wonder, of gratitude. In an instant he seemed transformed.  \"Collie, if I hadn't loved you before I'd love you now. That was going to be the hardest job I ever had--to tell you my--my story. I meant it. And now I'll not have to feel your shame for me and I'll not feel I'm a cheat or a liar.... But I will tell you this--if you love me you'll make a man of me!\"    CHAPTER III  The rancher thought it best to wait till after the round-up before he turned over the foremanship to his son. This was wise, but Jack did not see it that way. He showed that his old, intolerant spirit had, if anything, grown during his absence. Belllounds patiently argued with him, explaining what certainly should have been clear to a young man brought up in Colorado. The fall round-up was the most important time of the year, and during the strenuous drive the appointed foreman should have absolute control. Jack gave in finally with a bad grace.  It was unfortunate that he went directly from his father's presence out to the corrals. Some of the cowboys who had ridden all the day before and stood guard all night had just come in. They were begrimed with dust, weary, and sleepy-eyed.  \"This hyar outfit won't see my tracks no more,\" said one, disgustedly. \"I never kicked on doin' two men's work. But when it comes to rustlin' day and night, all the time, I'm a-goin' to pass.\"  \"Turn in, boys, and sleep till we get back with the chuck-wagon,\" said Wilson Moore. \"We'll clean up that bunch to-day.\"  \"Ain't you tired, Wils?\" queried Bludsoe, a squat, bow-legged cowpuncher who appeared to be crippled or very lame.  \"Me? Naw!\" grunted Moore, derisively. \"Blud, you sure ask fool questions.... Why, you--mahogany-colored, stump-legged, biped of a cowpuncher, I've had three hours' sleep in four nights!\"  \"What's a biped?\" asked Bludsoe, dubiously.  Nobody enlightened him.  \"Wils, you-all air the only eddicated cowman I ever loved, but I'm a son-of-a-gun if we ain't agoin' to come to blows some day,\" declared Bludsoe.  \"He shore can sling English,\" drawled Lem Billings. \"I reckon he swallowed a dictionary onct.\"  \"Wal, he can sling a rope, too, an' thet evens up,\" added Jim Montana.  Just at this moment Jack Belllounds appeared upon the scene. The cowboys took no notice of him. Jim was bandaging a leg of his horse; Bludsoe was wearily gathering up his saddle and trappings; Lem was giving his tired mustang a parting slap that meant much. Moore evidently awaited a fresh mount. A Mexican lad had come in out of the pasture leading several horses, one of which was the mottled white mustang that Moore rode most of the time.  Belllounds lounged forward with interest as Moore whistled, and the mustang showed his pleasure. Manifestly he did not like the Mexican boy and he did like Moore.  \"Spottie, it's drag yearlings around for you to-day,\" said the cowboy, as he caught the mustang. Spottie tossed his head and stepped high until the bridle was on. When the saddle was thrown and strapped in place the mustang showed to advantage. He was beautiful, but not too graceful or sleek or fine-pointed or prancing to prejudice any cowboy against his qualities for work.  Jack Belllounds admiringly walked all around the mustang a little too close to please Spottie.  \"Moore, he's a fair-to-middling horse,\" said Belllounds, with the air of judge of horseflesh. \"What's his name?\"  \"Spottie,\" replied Moore, shortly, as he made ready to mount.  \"Hold on, will you!\" ordered Jack, peremptorily. \"I like this horse. I want to look him over.\"  When he grasped the bridle-reins out of the cowboy's hand Spottie jumped as if he had been shot at. Belllounds jerked at him and went closer. The mustang reared, snorting, plunging to get loose. Then Jack Belllounds showed the sudden temper for which he was noted. Red stained his pale cheeks.  \"Damn you--come down!\" he shouted, infuriated at the mustang, and with both hands he gave a powerful lunge. Spottie came down, and stood there, trembling all over, his ears laid back, his eyes showing fright and pain. Blood dripped from his mouth where the bit had cut him.  \"I'll teach you to stand,\" said Belllounds, darkly. \"Moore, lend me your spurs. I want to try him out.\"  \"I don't lend my spurs--or my horse, either,\" replied the cowboy, quietly, with a stride that put him within reach of Spottie.  The other cowboys had dropped their trappings and stood at attention, with intent gaze and mute lips.  \"Is he your horse?\" demanded Jack, with a quick flush.  \"I reckon so,\" replied Moore, slowly. \"No one but me ever rode him.\"  \"Does my father own him or do you own him?\"  \"Well, if that's the way you figure--he belongs to White Slides,\" returned the cowboy. \"I never bought him. I only raised him from a colt, broke him, and rode him.\"  \"I thought so. Moore, he's mine, and I'm going to ride him now. Lend me spurs, one of you cowpunchers.\"  Nobody made any motion to comply. There seemed to be a suspense at hand that escaped Belllounds.  \"I'll ride him without spurs,\" he declared, presently, and again he turned to mount the mustang.  \"Belllounds, it'd be better for you not to ride him now,\" said Moore, coolly.  \"Why, I'd like to know?\" demanded Belllounds, with the temper of one who did not tolerate opposition.  \"He's the only horse left for me to ride,\" answered the cowboy. \"We're branding to-day. Hudson was hurt yesterday. He was foreman, and he appointed me to fill his place. I've got to rope yearlings. Now, if you get up on Spottie you'll excite him. He's high-strung, nervous. That'll be bad for him, as he hates cutting-out and roping.\"  The reasonableness of this argument was lost upon Belllounds.  \"Moore, maybe it'd interest you to know that I'm foreman of White Slides,\" he asserted, not without loftiness.  His speech manifestly decided something vital for the cowboy.  \"Ahuh!... I'm sure interested this minute,\" replied Moore, and then, stepping to the side of the mustang, with swift hands he unbuckled the cinch, and with one sweep he drew saddle and blanket to the ground.  The action surprised Belllounds. He stared. There seemed something boyish in his lack of comprehension. Then his temper flamed.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded, with a strident note in his voice. \"Put that saddle back.\"  \"Not much. It's my saddle. Cost sixty dollars at Kremmling last year. Good old hard-earned saddle!... And you can't ride it. Savvy?\"  \"Yes, I savvy,\" replied Belllounds, violently. \"Now you'll savvy what I say. I'll have you discharged.\"  \"Nope. Too late,\" said Moore, with cool, easy scorn. \"I figured that. And I quit a minute ago--when you showed what little regard you had for a horse.\"  \"You quit!... Well, it's damned good riddance. I wouldn't have you in the outfit.\"  \"You couldn't have kept me, Buster Jack.\"  The epithet must have been an insult to Belllounds. \"Don't you dare call me that,\" he burst out, furiously.  Moore pretended surprise. \"Why not? It's your range name. We all get a handle, whether we like it or not. There's Montana and Blud and Lemme Two Bits. They call me Professor. Why should you kick on yours?\"  \"I won't stand it now. Not from any one--especially not you.\"  \"Ahuh! Well, I'm afraid it'll stick,\" replied Moore, with sarcasm. \"It sure suits you. Don't you bust everything you monkey with? Your old dad will sure be glad to see you bust the round-up to-day--and I reckon the outfit to-morrow.\"  \"You insolent cowpuncher!\" shouted Belllounds, growing beside himself with rage. \"If you don't shut up I'll bust your face.\"  \"Shut up!... Me? Nope. It can't be did. This is a free country, Buster Jack.\" There was no denying Moore's cool, stinging repetition of the epithet that had so affronted Belllounds.  \"I always hated you!\" he rasped out, hoarsely. Striking hard at Moore, he missed, but a second effort landed a glancing blow on the cowboy's face.  Moore staggered back, recovered his balance, and, hitting out shortly, he returned the blow. Belllounds fell against the corral fence, which upheld him.  \"Buster Jack--you're crazy!\" cried the cowboy, his eyes flashing. \"Do you think you can lick me--after where you've been these three years?\"  Like a maddened boy Belllounds leaped forward, this time his increased violence and wildness of face expressive of malignant rage. He swung his arms at random. Moore avoided his blows and planted a fist squarely on his adversary's snarling mouth. Belllounds fell with a thump. He got up with clumsy haste, but did not rush forward again. His big, prominent eyes held a dark and ugly look. His lower jaw wabbled as he panted for breath and speech at once.  \"Moore--I'll kill--you!\" he hissed, with glance flying everywhere for a weapon. From ground to cowboys he looked. Bludsoe was the only one packing a gun. Belllounds saw it, and he was so swift in bounding forward that he got a hand on it before Bludsoe could prevent.  \"Let go! Give me--that gun! By God! I'll fix him!\" yelled Belllounds, as Bludsoe grappled with him.  There was a sharp struggle. Bludsoe wrenched the other's hands free, and, pulling the gun, he essayed to throw it. But Belllounds blocked his action and the gun fell at their feet.  \"Grab it!\" sang out Bludsoe, ringingly. \"Quick, somebody! The damned fool'll kill Wils.\"  Lem, running in, kicked the gun just as"]]]
