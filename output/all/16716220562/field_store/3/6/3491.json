Grandma Elsie's college boys, Harold and Herbert Travilla, had come home for the holidays, arriving the latter part of the previous week. This morning they had come over to Woodburn, very soon after breakfast, \"to have a chat with Vi while they could catch her alone,\" they said, \"for with all the company that was to be entertained at Ion they might not have so good a chance again.\"  They stood with her at the window watching the carriage as it drove away with the captain and his children. It had hardly reached the gate leading into the high road when Harold turned to his sister with the remark,  \"Well, Vi, we've had quite a satisfactory talk; and now for action. As I overheard the captain say to the children, 'there's no time to lose.'\"  \"No; we will begin at once,\" returned Violet, leading the way to the large room where the Christmas tree had been set up last year.  A couple of negro men were carrying in its counterpart at one door, as Violet and her brother entered at the other.  \"Ah that's a fine tree, Jack!\" she said addressing one of them; \"the captain selected it, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, Miss Wi'let, de cap'n done say dis hyar one was for de Woodburn chillen; an' we's to watch an' fotch 'em in soon's dey's clar gone out ob sight.\"  \"Yes,\" she said, \"we want to give them a pleasant surprise. I think they are doubtful as to whether their father intends that they shall have a tree this year,\" she added, aside to her brothers.  \"Then the surprise will be the greater,\" Harold returned; \"and it is half the fun. I supposed they were pretty certain of the tree, and would be surprised only by the nature of the gifts.\"  \"They will have a goodly supply of those,\" Violet said, with a pleased look, glancing in the direction of a table heaped with packages of various sizes and shapes. \"Do you know, boys, when Christmas times come round I always feel glad I married a man with children; it's such a dear delight to lay plans for their enjoyment and to carry them out.\"  \"Just like you, Vi,\" said Herbert, \"and I like to hear you talk in that way; but you have your own two.\"  \"Yes; but even Elsie is hardly old enough yet to care very much for such things.\"  The tree was now in place and the work of trimming it began.  \"It's very good in you boys to come here and help me instead of joining in the fun they are doubtless having at the school-house,\" remarked Violet, as she handed a glittering fairy to Harold who was mounted upon a step-ladder alongside of the tree. \"There, I think that will look well perched on that topmost bough.\"  \"Our tastes agree,\" he said, fastening the fairy in the designated spot.  \"Yes, I think Herbie and I are entitled to any amount of gratitude on your part, for the great self-denial we are practicing, and the wonderful exertions we shall put forth in carrying out your wishes and directions in regard to this difficult and irksome business.\"  \"And the fine phrases and well turned periods contained in the remarks bestowed upon your unsophisticated country sister,\" laughed Violet.  \"Of course they must not be forgotten in the reckoning up of your causes for gratitude. Ah, Vi, how my heart goes out in pity and sympathy for you when I reflect that you not only never have shared in the inestimable privileges and delights of college boy life, but are, in the very nature of things, forever debarred from participation in them!\"  \"I entirely appreciate your feelings on the subject,\" she said, with mock gravity, \"but would advise that for the present you forget them, and give your undivided attention to the business in hand. That second fairy does not maintain a very graceful attitude.\"  \"True enough,\" he said, promptly altering its position. \"There, how's that for high?\"  \"Is it possible I hear such slang from the educated tongue of a college boy?\" she exclaimed with a gesture of astonishment and dismay.  \"She's high enough,\" said Herbert, gazing scrutinizingly at the fairy, \"but there'd better be more work and less talk if we are to get through before the captain and his party come home.\"  \"Herbert, when Mrs. Raymond and I have reached your venerable age you may expect to find us as sedate and industrious as you are now,\" remarked Harold, proceeding to hang upon the tree various ornaments, as Herbert handed them to him.  \"And in Harold's case due allowance must be made for the exuberance of spirits of a boy just let out of school,\" added Violet.  \"And in your case, my dear madam, for what? a youthful flow of spirits consequent upon a temporary release from the heavy responsibilities of wifehood and motherhood?\"  \"Very temporary,\" laughed Violet; \"my husband will be here again in a few hours, and the call to attend to my babies may come at any moment.\"  \"I daresay if the captain had consulted only his own inclination he would be here now, overseeing this job,\" remarked Harold, half interrogatively.  \"Yes,\" replied Violet; \"but he thought his duty called him to the other places; and I think my good husband never fails to go where duty calls. We talked it over and concluded that the best plan we could hit upon was for me to stay at home and see to this work, while he should take his children and assist at the decoration of the school-houses.\"  \"To secure you an opportunity to prepare a pleasant surprise for them,\" supplemented Harold.  Their work was finished, its results surveyed with satisfaction, and the door of the room closed and locked upon it, before the return of the carriage bringing Capt. Raymond and his merry, happy little flock.  Dinner filled up the greater part of the interval between their home-coming and return to the school-house on the corner of the estate, to witness the distribution of gifts to the poor whites of the neighborhood; and by a little management on the part of their father, Violet and her brothers, they were kept from the vicinity of the room where the Christmas tree stood, and got no hint of its existence.  Their thoughts were full of the doings of the morning and the coming events of the afternoon, and their tongues ran fast on the two subjects. Their father had to remind them once or twice that older people must be allowed a chance to talk as well as themselves; but his tone was not stern, and the slight reproof, though sufficient to produce the desired effect, threw no damper upon their youthful spirits.  They were in the carriage again soon after leaving the table, Violet with them this time, Harold and Herbert riding on horseback alongside of the vehicle, for they desired a share in witnessing the bestowal of the gifts.  They found teacher and pupils there before them; every face bright with pleasurable anticipation.  The Jones children, whose mother had died the year before, and who had continued to find a good friend in Capt. Raymond, were among the number.  Grandma Elsie, Zoe, Rosie, Walter and Evelyn Leland arrived in a body soon after the Woodburn family, and then the exercises began.  The captain offered a short prayer, and made a little address appropriate to the occasion; teacher and scholars sang a hymn, a Christmas carol; then the tree was unveiled amid murmurs of admiration and delight, and the distribution of the gifts began.  Every child received a suit of warm, comfortable clothes, a book, a bag of candy, a sandwich or two, some cakes and fruit.  The tree was hung with rosy-cheeked apples, oranges, bananas, bunches of grapes and strings of popcorn. There were bright tinsel ornaments too, and a goodly array of gaily dressed paper dolls, mostly Gracie's contribution.  She had given up all her store for the gratification of the poor children.  \"I've had such good times myself, playing with them and dressing them, that I do believe the poor children, that don't have half the pleasures I do, will enjoy them too, and I can do very well without,\" she said to Lulu on deciding to make the sacrifice.  So she told her father they were not to be used merely as a temporary ornament for the tree, but to be given away to some of the younger girls attending the school.  They, along with other pretty things, were taken from the tree and presented last of all, and the delight manifested by the recipients more than made amends to Gracie for her self-denial.  From the Woodburn school-house our friends all repaired to the one at Ion, and a similar scene was enacted there. The exercises and the gifts to the children were very nearly the same, but there were older people--house servants and laborers on the estates--to whom were given more substantial gifts in money and provisions for the support of their families.  The afternoon was waning when the Raymonds again entered their family carriage and the captain gave the order, \"Home to Woodburn.\"  And now the children began to think of the home celebration of Christmas eve, and to renew their wonderings as to what arrangements might have been made for their own enjoyment of its return. Still they asked no question on the subject, but they sobered down and were very quiet during the short drive.  \"Tired, children?\" queried their father, putting an arm round Grace as she leaned confidingly up against him, and smiling affectionately upon them all.  \"Oh, no, sir, not at all!\" replied Max, quickly, straightening himself with the air of one who had no thought of fatigue.  \"Not at all, papa,\" echoed Lulu.  \"Only just a little bit, papa,\" Grace said with cheerful look and tone. \"We have had such a nice day.\"  \"Giving pleasure to others,\" he remarked, patting the rosy cheek resting against his shoulder; \"there is nothing more enjoyable. The little girls were very glad to get your dollies.\"  \"Yes, sir; I'm so glad I gave them.\"  The carriage stopped. They were at their own door. In another minute they had all alighted and the children were following their father and Violet into the house.  A Newfoundland dog, a magnificent specimen of his race, met them almost at the threshold.  \"Oh!\" cried the children, in excited chorus, \"where, did he come"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14535"],["title","A Christmas Sermon (#0)"],["body","CHRISTMAS SERMON  by  ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON  New York  1900        A CHRISTMAS SERMON   By the time this paper appears, I shall have been talking for twelve months;[1] and it is thought I should take my leave in a formal and seasonable manner. Valedictory eloquence is rare, and death-bed sayings have not often hit the mark of the occasion. Charles Second, wit and sceptic, a man whose life had been one long lesson in human incredulity, an easy-going comrade, a manoeuvring king--remembered and embodied all his wit and scepticism along with more than his usual good humour in the famous \"I am afraid, gentlemen, I am an unconscionable time a-dying.\"  [Footnote 1: i.e. In the pages of _Scribner's Magazine_ (1888).]     I   An unconscionable time a-dying--there is the picture (\"I am afraid, gentlemen,\") of your life and of mine. The sands run out, and the hours are \"numbered and imputed,\" and the days go by; and when the last of these finds us, we have been a long time dying, and what else? The very length is something, if we reach that hour of separation undishonoured; and to have lived at all is doubtless (in the soldierly expression) to have served. There is a tale in Tacitus of how the veterans mutinied in the German wilderness; of how they mobbed Germanicus, clamouring to go home; and of how, seizing their general's hand, these old, war-worn exiles passed his finger along their toothless gums. _Sunt lacrymae rerum_: this was the most eloquent of the songs of Simeon. And when a man has lived to a fair age, he bears his marks of service. He may have never been remarked upon the breach at the head of the army; at least he shall have lost his teeth on the camp bread.  The idealism of serious people in this age of ours is of a noble character. It never seems to them that they have served enough; they have a fine impatience of their virtues. It were perhaps more modest to be singly thankful that we are no worse. It is not only our enemies, those desperate characters--it is we ourselves who know not what we do;--thence springs the glimmering hope that perhaps we do better than we think: that to scramble through this random business with hands reasonably clean, to have played the part of a man or woman with some reasonable fulness, to have often resisted the diabolic, and at the end to be still resisting it, is for the poor human soldier to have done right well. To ask to see some fruit of our endeavour is but a transcendental way of serving for reward; and what we take to be contempt of self is only greed of hire.  And again if we require so much of ourselves, shall we not require much of others? If we do not genially judge our own deficiencies, is it not to be feared we shall be even stern to the trespasses of others? And he who (looking back upon his own life) can see no more than that he has been unconscionably long a-dying, will he not be tempted to think his neighbour unconscionably long of getting hanged? It is probable that nearly all who think of conduct at all, think of it too much; it is certain we all think too much of sin. We are not damned for doing wrong, but for not doing right; Christ would never hear of negative morality; _thou shalt_ was ever his word, with which he superseded _thou shalt not_. To make our idea of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile the imagination and to introduce into our judgments of our fellow-men a secret element of gusto. If a thing is wrong for us, we should not dwell upon the thought of it; or we shall soon dwell upon it with inverted pleasure. If we cannot drive it from our minds--one thing of two: either our creed is in the wrong and we must more indulgently remodel it; or else, if our morality be in the right, we are criminal lunatics and should place our persons in restraint. A mark of such unwholesomely divided minds is the passion for interference with others: the Fox without the Tail was of this breed, but had (if his biographer is to be trusted) a certain antique civility now out of date. A man may have a flaw, a weakness, that unfits him for the duties of life, that spoils his temper, that threatens his integrity, or that betrays him into cruelty. It has to be conquered; but it must never be suffered to engross his thoughts. The true duties lie all upon the farther side, and must be attended to with a whole mind so soon as this preliminary clearing of the decks has been effected. In order that he may be kind and honest, it may be needful he should become a total abstainer; let him become so then, and the next day let him forget the circumstance. Trying to be kind and honest will require all his thoughts; a mortified appetite is never a wise companion; in so far as he has had to mortify an appetite, he will still be the worse man; and of such an one a great deal of cheerfulness will be required in judging life, and a great deal of humility in judging others.  It may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our life's endeavour springs in some degree from dulness. We require higher tasks, because we do not recognise the height of those we have. Trying to be kind and honest seems an affair too simple and too inconsequential for gentlemen of our heroic mould; we had rather set ourselves to something bold, arduous, and conclusive; we had rather found a schism or suppress a heresy, cut off a hand or mortify an appetite. But the task before us, which is to co-endure with our existence, is rather one of microscopic fineness, and the heroism required is that of patience. There is no cutting of the Gordian knots of life; each must be smilingly unravelled.  To be honest, to be kind--to earn a little and to spend a little less, to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence, to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered, to keep a few friends but these without capitulation--above all, on the same grim condition, to keep friends with himself--here is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy. He has an ambitious soul who would ask more; he has a hopeful spirit who should look in such an enterprise to be successful. There is indeed one element in human destiny that not blindness itself can controvert: whatever else we are intended to do, we are not intended to succeed; failure is the fate allotted. It is so in every art and study; it is so above all in the continent art of living well. Here is a pleasant thought for the year's end or for the end of life: Only self-deception will be satisfied, and there need be no despair for the despairer.     II   But Christmas is not only the mile-mark of another year, moving us to thoughts of self-examination: it is a season, from all its associations, whether domestic or religious, suggesting thoughts of joy. A man dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to sadness. And in the midst of the winter, when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty chairs of his beloved, it is well he should be condemned to this fashion of the smiling face. Noble disappointment, noble self-denial are not to be admired, not even to be pardoned, if they bring bitterness. It is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven maim; another to maim yourself and stay without. And the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike, of those who are easy to please, who love and who give pleasure. Mighty men of their hands, the smiters and the builders and the judges, have lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely character; and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns, the shame were indelible if _we_ should lose it. Gentleness and cheerfulness, these come before all morality; they are the perfect duties. And it is the trouble with moral men that they have neither one nor other. It was the moral man, the Pharisee, whom Christ could not away with. If your morals make you dreary, depend upon it they are wrong. I do not say \"give them up,\" for they may be all you have; but conceal them like a vice, lest they should spoil the lives of better and simpler people.  A strange temptation attends upon man: to keep his eye on pleasures, even when he will not share in them; to aim all his morals against them. This very year a lady (singular iconoclast!) proclaimed a crusade against dolls; and the racy sermon against lust is a feature of the age. I venture to call such moralists insincere. At any excess or perversion of a natural appetite, their lyre sounds of itself with relishing denunciations; but for all displays of the truly diabolic--envy, malice, the mean lie, the mean silence, the calumnious truth, the backbiter, the petty tyrant, the peevish poisoner of family life--their standard is quite different. These are wrong, they will admit, yet somehow not so wrong; there is no zeal in their assault on them, no secret element of gusto warms up the sermon; it is for things not wrong in themselves that they reserve the choicest of their indignation. A man may naturally disclaim all moral kinship with the Reverend Mr. Zola or the hobgoblin old lady of the dolls; for these are gross and naked instances. And yet in each of us some similar element resides. The sight of a pleasure in which we cannot or else will not share moves us to a particular impatience. It may be because we are envious, or because we are sad, or because we dislike noise and romping--being so refined, or because--being so philosophic--we have an overweighing sense of life's gravity: at least, as we go on in years, we are all tempted to frown upon our neighbour's pleasures. People are nowadays so fond of resisting temptations; here is one to be resisted. They are fond of self-denial; here is a propensity that cannot be too peremptorily denied. There is an idea abroad among moral people that they should make their neighbours good. One person I have to make good: myself. But my duty to my neighbour is much more nearly expressed by saying that I have to make him happy--if I may.     III   Happiness and goodness, according to canting"]]]
