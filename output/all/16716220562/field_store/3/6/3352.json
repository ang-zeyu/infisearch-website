Till death shall part!  O faithless, cruel thought!   Death ne'er shall part souls joined by holy love,   Who through life's trials, joys and cares   Have to each other clung, faithful till death,   Tender and true in sickness and in health,   Bearing each other's burdens, sharing griefs,   Lightening each care and heightening every joy.   Such life is but a transient honeymoon,   A feeble foretaste of eternal joys.   But princes when they love, though all approve,   Must wait on councils, embassies and forms.   But how the coach of state lumbers and lags   With messages of love whose own light wings   Glide through all bars, outstrip all fleetest things--   No bird so light, no thought so fleet as they.    But while the prince chafed at the long delay,   The sweet Yasodhara began to feel   The bitter pangs of unrequited love.   But her young hands, busy with others' wants,   And her young heart, busy with others' woes,   With acts of kindness filled the lagging hours,   Best of all medicines for aching hearts.   Yet often she would seek a quiet nook   Deep in the park, where giant trees cross arms,   Making high gothic arches, and a shade   That noonday's fiercest rays could scarcely pierce,   And there alone with her sad heart communed:   \"Yes!  I have kept it for the giver's sake,   But he has quite forgot his love, his gift, and me.   How bright these jewels seemed warmed by his love,   But now how dull, how icy and how dead!\"   But soon the soft-eyed antelopes and fawns   And fleet gazelles came near and licked her hands;   And birds of every rich and varied plume   Gathered around and filled the air with song;   And even timid pheasants brought their broods,   For her sweet loving life had here restored   The peace and harmony of paradise;   And as they shared her bounty she was soothed   By their mute confidence and perfect trust.    But though time seems to lag, yet still it moves,   Resistless as the ocean's swelling tide,   Bearing its mighty freight of human lives   With all their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears,   Onward, forever onward, to life's goal.   At length the embassy is sent, and now,   Just as the last faint rays of rosy light   Fade from the topmost Himalayan peaks,   And tired nature sinks to quiet rest,   A horseman dashes through the silent streets   Bearing the waiting prince the welcome word   That one short journey of a single day   Divides him from the sweet Yasodhara;   And light-winged rumor spreads the joyful news,   And ere the dawn had danced from mountain-top   O'er hill and vale and plain to the sweet notes   Of nature's rich and varied orchestra,   And dried the pearly tears that night had wept,   The prince led forth his train to meet his bride,   Wondering that Kantaka, always so free,   So eager and so fleet, should seem to lag.   And in that fragrant garden's cooling shade,   Where they had parted, now again they meet,   And there we leave them reverently alone,   For art can never paint nor words describe   The peace and rest and rapture of that scene.    Meanwhile the city rings with busy stir.   The streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes,   And when the evening shades had veiled the earth,   And heaven's blue vault was set with myriad stars,   The promised signal from the watchtower sounds,   And myriad lamps shine from each house and tree,   And merry children strew their way with flowers,   And all come forth to greet Siddartha's bride,   And welcome her, their second Maya, home.   And at the palace gate the good old king   Receives her with such loving tenderness,   As fondest mother, sick with hope deferred,   Waiting and watching for an absent child,   At length receives him in her open arms.

[3]One may be satisfied with the antiquity of the dance, practically as we have it, from lines 187-8, Book VI. of the Odyssey:    \"Joyful they see applauding princes gaze   When stately in the dance they swim the harmonious maze.\"   [4]I am aware I place Kapilavasta nearer the Vale of Cashmere than most, but as two such writers as Beal and Rhys Davids differ 30 yojanas, or 180 miles in its location, and as no remains have yet been identified at all corresponding to the grandeur of the ancient city as described by all Buddhist writers, I felt free to indulge my fancy. Perhaps these ruins may yet be found by some chance traveler in some unexplored jungle.       BOOK III.    And now his cup with every blessing filled   Full to the brim, to overflowing full,   What more has life to give or heart to wish?   Stately in form, with every princely grace,   A very master of all manly arts,   His gentle manners making all his friends,   His young blood bounding on in healthful flow,   His broad domains rich in all earth can yield,   Guarded by nature and his people's love,   And now that deepest of all wants supplied,   The want of one to share each inmost thought,   Whose sympathy can soothe each inmost smart,   Whose presence, care and loving touch can make   The palace or the humblest cottage home,   His life seemed rounded, perfect, full, complete.   And they were happy as the days glide on,   And when at night, locked in each other's arms,   They sink to rest, heart beating close to heart,   Their thoughts all innocence and trust and love,   It almost seemed as if remorseless Time   Had backward rolled his tide, and brought again   The golden age, with all its peace and joy,   And our first parents, ere the tempter came,   Were taking sweet repose in paradise.   But as one night they slept, a troubled dream   Disturbed the prince.  He dreamed he saw one come,   As young and fair as sweet Yasodhara,   But clad in widow's weeds, and in her arms   A lifeless child, crying: \"Most mighty prince!   O bring me back my husband and my child!\"   But he could only say \"Alas! poor soul!\"   And started out of sleep he cried \"Alas!\"   Which waked the sweet Yasodhara, who asked,   \"What ails my love?\"  \"Only a troubled dream,\"   The prince replied, but still she felt him tremble,   And kissed and stroked his troubled brow,   And soothed him into quiet sleep again.   And then once more he dreamed--a pleasing dream.   He dreamed he heard strange music, soft and sweet;   He only caught its burden: \"Peace, be still!\"   And then he thought he saw far off a light,   And there a place where all was peace and rest,   And waking sighed to find it all a dream.    One day this happy couple, side by side,   Rode forth alone, Yasodhara unveiled--   \"For why,\" said she, \"should those whose thoughts are pure   Like guilty things hide from their fellow-men?\"--   Rode through the crowded streets, their only guard   The people's love, strongest and best of guards;   For many arms would spring to their defense,   While some grim tyrant, at whose stern command   A million swords would from their scabbards leap,   Cringes in terror behind bolts and bars,   Starts at each sound, and fears some hidden mine   May into atoms blow his stately towers,   Or that some hand unseen may strike him down,   And thinks that poison lurks in every cup,   While thousands are in loathsome dungeons thrust   Or pine in exile for a look or word.   And as they pass along from street to street   A sea of happy faces lines their way,   Their joyful greetings answered by the prince.   No face once seen, no name once heard, forgot,   While sweet Yasodhara was wreathed in smiles,   The kind expression of her gentle heart,   When from a little cottage by the way,   The people making room for him to pass,   There came an aged man, so very old   That time had ceased to register his years;   His step was firm, his eye, though faded, mild,   And childhood's sweet expression on his face.   The prince stopped short before him, bending low,   And gently asked: \"What would my father have?   Speak freely--what I can, I freely give.\"   \"Most noble prince, I need no charity,   For my kind neighbors give me all unasked,   And my poor cottage where my fathers dwelt,   And where my children and their mother died,   Is kept as clean as when sweet Gunga lived;   And young and old cheer up my lonely hours,   And ask me much of other times and men.   For when your father's father was a child,   I was a man, as young and strong as you,   And my sweet Gunga your companion's age.   But O the mystery of life explain!   Why are we born to tread this little round,   To live, to love, to suffer, sorrow, die?   Why do the young like field-flowers bloom to fade?   Why are the strong like the mown grass cut down?   Why am I left as if by death forgot,   Left here alone, a leafless, fruitless trunk?   Is death the end, or what comes after death?   Often when deepest sleep shuts out the world,   The dead still seem to live, while life fades out;   And when I sit alone and long for light   The veil seems lifted, and I seem to see   A world of life and light and peace and rest,   No sickness, sin or sorrow, pain or death,   No helpless infancy or hopeless age.   But we poor Sudras cannot understand--   Yet from my earliest memory I've heard   That from this hill one day should burst a light,   Not for the Brahmans only, but for all.   And when you were a child I saw a sage   Bow down before you, calling you that light.   O noble, mighty prince! let your light shine,   That men no longer grope in dark despair!\"    He spoke, and sank exhausted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],["title","The Dawn and the Day (#8)"],["body"," the ground.   They gently raised him, but his life was fled.   The prince gave one a well-filled purse and said:   \"Let his pile neither lack for sandal-wood   Or any emblem of a life well spent.\"   And when fit time had passed they bore him thence   And laid him on that couch where all sleep well,   Half hid in flowers by loving children brought,   A smile still lingering on his still, cold lips,   As if they just had tasted Gunga's kiss,   Soon to be kissed by eager whirling flames.    Just then two stately Brahmans proudly passed--   Passed on the other side, gathering their robes   To shun pollution from the common touch,   And passing said: \"The prince with Sudras talks   As friend to friend--but wisdom comes with years.\"    Silent and thoughtful then they homeward turned,   The prince deep musing on the old man's words;   \"'The veil is lifted, and I seem to see   A world of life and light and peace and rest.'   O if that veil would only lift for me   The mystery of life would be explained.\"   As they passed on through unfrequented streets,   Seeking to shun the busy, thoughtless throng,   Those other words like duty's bugle-call   Still ringing in his ears: \"Let your light shine,   That men no longer grope in dark despair\"--   The old sad thoughts, long checked by passing joys,   Rolling and surging, swept his troubled soul--   As pent-up waters, having burst their dams,   Sweep down the valleys and o'erwhelm the plains.    Just then an aged, angry voice cried out:   \"O help! they've stolen my jewels and my gold!\"   And from a wretched hovel by the way   An old man came, hated and shunned by all,   Whose life was spent in hoarding unused gold,   Grinding the poor, devouring widows' homes;   Ill fed, ill clad, from eagerness to save,   His sunken eyes glittering with rage and greed.   And when the prince enquired what troubled him:   \"Trouble enough,\" he said, \"my sons have fled   Because I would not waste in dainty fare   And rich apparel all my life has saved,   And taken all my jewels, all my gold.   Would that they both lay dead before my face!   O precious jewels!  O beloved gold!\"   The prince, helpless to soothe, hopeless to cure   This rust and canker of the soul, passed on,   His heart with all-embracing pity filled.   \"O deepening mystery of life!\" he cried,   \"Why do such souls in human bodies dwell--   Fitter for ravening wolves or greedy swine!   Just at death's door cursing his flesh and blood   For thievish greed inherited from him.   Is this old age, or swinish greed grown old?   O how unlike that other life just fled!   His youth's companions, wife and children, dead,   Yet filled with love for all, by all beloved,   With his whole heart yearning for others' good,   With his last breath bewailing others' woes.\"   \"My best beloved,\" said sweet Yasodhara,   Her bright eyes filled with sympathetic tears,   Her whole soul yearning for his inward peace,   \"Brood not too much on life's dark mystery--   Behind the darkest clouds the sun still shines.\"   \"But,\" said the prince, \"the many blindly grope   In sorrow, fear and ignorance profound,   While their proud teachers, with their heads erect,   Stalk boldly on, blind leaders of the blind.   Come care, come fasting, woe and pain for me,   And even exile from my own sweet home,   All would I welcome could I give them light.\"   \"But would you leave your home, leave me, leave all,   And even leave our unborn pledge of love,   The living blending of our inmost souls,   That now within me stirs to bid you pause?\"   \"Only for love of you and him and all!   O hard necessity!  O bitter cup!   But would you have me like a coward shun   The path of duty, though beset with thorns--   Thorns that must pierce your tender feet and mine?\"   Piercing the question as the sharpest sword;   Their love, their joys, tempted to say him nay.   But soon she conquered all and calmly said:   \"My love, my life, where duty plainly calls   I bid you go, though my poor heart must bleed,   And though my eyes weep bitter scalding tears.\"    Their hearts too full for words, too full for tears,   Gently he pressed her hand and they passed home;   And in the presence of this dark unknown   A deep and all-pervading tenderness   Guides every act and tempers every tone--   As in the chamber of the sick and loved   The step is light, the voice is soft and low.   But soon their days with varied duties filled,   Their nights with sweet repose, glide smoothly on,   Until this shadow seems to lift and fade--   As when the sun bursts through the passing storm,   Gilding the glittering raindrops as they fall,   And paints the bow of hope on passing clouds.   Yet still the old sad thoughts sometimes return,   The burden of a duty unperformed,   The earnest yearning for a clearer light.   The thought that hour by hour and day by day   The helpless multitudes grope blindly on,   Clouded his joys and often banished sleep.    One day in this sad mood he thought to see   His people as they are in daily life,   And not in holiday attire to meet their prince.   In merchant's dress, his charioteer his clerk,   The prince and Channa passed unknown, and saw   The crowded streets alive with busy hum,   Traders cross-legged, with their varied wares,   The wordy war to cheapen or enhance,   One rushing on to clear the streets for wains   With huge stone wheels, by slow strong oxen drawn;   Palanquin-bearers droning out \"Hu, hu, ho, ho,\"   While keeping step and praising him they bear;   The housewives from the fountain water bring   In balanced water-jars, their black-eyed babes   Athwart their hips, their busy tongues meanwhile   Engaged in gossip of the little things   That make the daily round of life to them;   The skillful weaver at his clumsy loom;   The miller at his millstones grinding meal;   The armorer, linking his shirts of mail;   The money-changer at his heartless trade;   The gaping, eager crowd gathered to watch   Snake-charmers, that can make their deadly charge   Dance harmless to the drone of beaded gourds;   Sword-players, keeping many knives in air;   Jugglers, and those that dance on ropes swung high:   And all this varied work and busy idleness   As in a panorama passing by.    While they were passing through these varied scenes,   The prince, whose ears were tuned to life's sad notes,   Whose eyes were quick to catch its deepest shades,   Found sorrow, pain and want, disease and death,   Were woven in its very warp and woof.   A tiger, springing from a sheltering bush,   Had snatched a merchant's comrade from his side;   A deadly cobra, hidden by the path,   Had stung to death a widow's only son;   A breath of jungle-wind a youth's blood chilled,   Or filled a strong man's bones with piercing pain;   A household widowed by a careless step;   The quick cross-lightning from an angry cloud   Struck down a bridegroom bringing home his bride--   All this and more he heard, and much he saw:   A young man, stricken in life's early prime,   Shuffled along, dragging one palsied limb,   While one limp arm hung useless by his side;   A dwarf sold little knickknacks by the way,   His body scarcely in the human form,   To which long arms and legs seemed loosely hung,   His noble head thrust forward on his breast,   Whose pale, sad face as plainly told as words   That life had neither health nor hope for him;   An old man tottering from a hovel came,   Frail, haggard, palsied, leaning on a staff,   Whose eyes, dull, glazed and meaningless, proclaim   The body lingers when the mind has fled;   One seized with sudden hot distemper of the blood,   Writhing with anguish, by the wayside sunk.   The purple plague-spot on his pallid cheek,   Cold drops of perspiration on his brow,   With wildly rolling eyes and livid lips,   Gasping for breath and feebly asking help--   But ere the prince could aid, death gave relief.    At length they passed the city's outer gate   And down a stream, now spread in shining pools,   Now leaping in cascades, now dashing on,   A line of foam along its rocky bed,   Bordered by giant trees with densest shade.   Here, day by day, the city bring their dead;   Here, day by day, they build the funeral-piles;   Here lamentations daily fill the air;   Here hissing flames each day taste human flesh,   And friendly watchmen guard the smoldering pile   Till friends can cull the relics from the dust.   And here, just finished, rose a noble pile   By stately Brahmans for a Brahman built   Of fragrant woods, and drenched with fragrant oils,   Loading the air with every sweet perfume   That India's forests or her fields can yield;   Above, a couch of sacred cusa-grass,   On which no dreams disturb the sleeper's rest.   And now the sound of music reaches them,   Far off at first, solemn and sad and slow,   Rising and swelling as it nearer comes,   Until a long procession comes in view.   Four Brahmans first, bearing in bowls the fire   No more to burn on one deserted hearth,   Then stately Brahmans on their shoulders bore   A noble brother of their sacred caste,   In manhood's bloom and early prime cut down.   Then Brahman youth, bearing a little child   Half hid in flowers, and as in seeming sleep.   Then other Brahmans in a litter bore   One young and fair, in early womanhood,   Her youthful beauty joined with matron grace,   In bridal dress adorned with costly gems--   The very face the prince had dreaming seen,   The very child she carried in her arms.   Then many more, uncovered, four by four,   The aged first, then those in manhood's prime,   And then the young with many acolytes   Chanting in unison their sacred hymns,   Accompanied by many instruments,   Both wind and string, in solemn symphony;   And at respectful distance other castes,   Afraid to touch a Brahman's sacred robes   Or even mingle with his grief their tears.   And when they reached the fragrant funeral-pile,   Weeping they placed their dead on their last couch,   The child within its father's nerveless arms; "]]]
