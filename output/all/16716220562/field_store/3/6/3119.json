We seldom find instances of complete conversion of one part of speech into another.  When, in a sentence above, the terms _the great_, _the wealthy_, are used, they are not names only: we have in mind the idea of persons and the quality of being _great_ or _wealthy_. The words are used in the sentence where nouns are used, but have an adjectival meaning.  In the other sentences, _why_ and _wherefore_, _When_, _Now_, and _Then_, are spoken of as if pure nouns; but still the reader considers this not a natural application of them as name words, but as a figure of speech.  NOTE.--These remarks do not apply, of course, to such words as become pure nouns by use. There are many of these. The adjective _good_ has no claim on the noun _goods_; so, too, in speaking of the _principal_ of a school, or a state _secret_, or a faithful _domestic_, or a _criminal_, etc., the words are entirely independent of any adjective force.   Exercise.  Pick out the nouns in the following sentences, and tell to which class each belongs. Notice if any have shifted from one class to another.   1. Hope springs eternal in the human breast.  2. Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate.  3.  Stone walls do not a prison make.       Nor iron bars a cage.  4.

She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies.  8. Learning, that cobweb of the brain.  9.  A little weeping would ease my heart;       But in their briny bed      My tears must stop, for every drop       Hinders needle and thread.  10. A fool speaks all his mind, but a wise man reserves something for hereafter.  11. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.  12.

In Latin, Greek, German, and many other languages, some general rules are given that names of male beings are usually masculine, and names of females are usually feminine. There are exceptions even to this general statement, but not so in English. Male beings are, in English grammar, always masculine; female, always feminine.  When, however, _inanimate_ things are spoken of, these languages are totally unlike our own in determining the gender of words. For instance: in Latin, _hortus_ (garden) is masculine, _mensa_ (table) is feminine, _corpus_ (body) is neuter; in German, _das Messer_ (knife) is neuter, _der Tisch_ (table) is masculine, _die Gabel_ (fork) is feminine.  The great difference is, that in English the gender follows the _meaning_ of the word, in other languages gender follows the _form_; that is, in English, gender depends on _sex_: if a thing spoken of is of the male sex, the _name_ of it is masculine; if of the female sex, the _name_ of it is feminine. Hence:   [Sidenote: _Definition._]  22. Gender is the mode of distinguishing sex by words, or additions to words.   23. It is evident from this that English can have but two genders,--masculine and feminine.  [Sidenote: _Gender nouns. Neuter nouns._]  All nouns, then, must be divided into two principal classes,--gender nouns, those distinguishing the sex of the object; and neuter nouns, those which do not distinguish sex, or names of things without life, and consequently without sex.  Gender nouns include names of persons and some names of animals; neuter nouns include some animals and all inanimate objects.   [Sidenote: _Some words either gender or neuter nouns, according to use._]  24. Some words may be either gender nouns or neuter nouns, according to their use. Thus, the word _child_ is neuter in the sentence, \"A little _child_ shall lead them,\" but is masculine in the sentence from Wordsworth,--                                      I have seen      A curious _child_ ... applying to _his_ ear      The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell.  Of animals, those with which man comes in contact often, or which arouse his interest most, are named by gender nouns, as in these sentences:--       Before the barn door strutted the gallant _cock_, that pattern of      a husband, ... clapping _his_ burnished wings.--IRVING.       _Gunpowder_ ... came to a stand just by the bridge, with a      suddenness that had nearly sent _his_ rider sprawling over _his_      head--_id._  Other animals are not distinguished as to sex, but are spoken of as neuter, the sex being of no consequence.       Not a _turkey_ but he [Ichabod] beheld daintily trussed up, with      _its_ gizzard under _its_ wing.--IRVING.       He next stooped down to feel the _pig_, if there were any signs      of life in _it_.--LAMB.   [Sidenote: _No \"common gender._\"]  25. According to the definition, there can be no such thing as \"common gender:\" words either distinguish sex (or the sex is distinguished by the context) or else they do not distinguish sex.  If such words as _parent_, _servant_, _teacher_, _ruler_, _relative_, _cousin_, _domestic_, etc., do not show the sex to which the persons belong, they are neuter words.   26. Put in convenient form, the division of words according to sex, or the lack of it, is,--                (MASCULINE: Male beings. Gender nouns {               (FEMININE: Female beings.  Neuter nouns: Names of inanimate things, or of living beings whose sex cannot be determined.   27. The inflections for gender belong, of course, only to masculine and feminine nouns. _Forms_ would be a more accurate word than _inflections_, since inflection applies only to the _case_ of nouns.  There are three ways to distinguish the genders:--  (1) By prefixing a gender word to another word.  (2) By adding a suffix, generally to a masculine word.  (3) By using a different word for each gender.   I. Gender shown by Prefixes.   [Sidenote: _Very few of class I._]  28. Usually the gender words _he_ and _she_ are prefixed to neuter words; as _he-goat_--_she-goat_, _cock sparrow_--_hen sparrow_, _he-bear_--_she-bear_.  One feminine, _woman_, puts a prefix before the masculine _man_. _Woman_ is a short way of writing _wifeman_.   II. Gender shown by Suffixes.   29. By far the largest number of gender words are those marked by suffixes. In this particular the native endings have been largely supplanted by foreign suffixes.  [Sidenote: _Native suffixes._]  The native suffixes to indicate the feminine were _-en_ and _-ster_. These remain in _vixen_ and _spinster_, though both words have lost their original meanings.  The word _vixen_ was once used as the feminine of _fox_ by the Southern-English. For _fox_ they said _vox_; for _from_ they said _vram_; and for the older word _fat_ they said _vat_, as in _wine vat_. Hence _vixen_ is for _fyxen_, from the masculine _fox_.  _Spinster_ is a relic of a large class of words that existed in Old and Middle English,[1] but have now lost their original force as feminines. The old masculine answering to _spinster_ was _spinner_; but _spinster_ has now no connection with it.  The foreign suffixes are of two kinds:--  [Sidenote: _Foreign suffixes. Unaltered and little used._]  (1) Those belonging to borrowed words, as _czarina_, _señorita_, _executrix_, _donna_. These are attached to foreign words, and are never used for words recognized as English.  [Sidenote: _Slightly changed and widely used._]  (2) That regarded as the standard or regular termination of the feminine, _-ess_ (French _esse_, Low Latin _issa_), the one most used. The corresponding masculine may have the ending _-er_ (_-or_), but in most cases it has not. Whenever we adopt a new masculine word, the feminine is formed by adding this termination _-ess_.  Sometimes the _-ess_ has been added to a word already feminine by the ending _-ster_; as _seam-str-ess_, _song-str-ess_. The ending _-ster_ had then lost its force as a feminine suffix; it has none now in the words _huckster_, _gamester_, _trickster_, _punster_.   [Sidenote: _Ending of masculine not changed._]  30. The ending _-ess_ is added to many words without changing the ending of the masculine; as,--    baron--baroness   count--countess   lion--lioness   Jew--Jewess   heir--heiress   host--hostess   priest--priestess   giant--giantess  [Sidenote: _Masculine ending dropped._]  The masculine ending may be dropped before the feminine _-ess_ is added; as,--    abbot--abbess   negro--negress   murderer--murderess   sorcerer--sorceress  [Sidenote: _Vowel dropped before adding_ -ess.]  The feminine may discard a vowel which appears in the masculine; as in--    actor--actress   master--mistress   benefactor--benefactress   emperor--empress   tiger--tigress   enchanter--enchantress  _Empress_ has been cut down from _emperice_ (twelfth century) and _emperesse_ (thirteenth century), from Latin _imperatricem_.  _Master_ and _mistress_ were in Middle English _maister_--_maistresse_, from the Old French _maistre_--_maistresse_.   31. When the older _-en_ and _-ster_ went out of use as the distinctive mark of the feminine, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],["title","An English Grammar (#4)"],["body"," _-ess_, from the French _-esse_, sprang into a popularity much greater than at present.  [Sidenote: _Ending_ -ess _less used now than formerly._]  Instead of saying _doctress_, _fosteress_, _wagoness_, as was said in the sixteenth century, or _servauntesse_, _teacheresse_, _neighboresse_, _frendesse_, as in the fourteenth century, we have dispensed with the ending in many cases, and either use a prefix word or leave the masculine to do work for the feminine also.  Thus, we say _doctor_ (masculine and feminine) or _woman doctor_, _teacher_ or _lady teacher_, _neighbor_ (masculine and feminine), etc. We frequently use such words as _author_, _editor_, _chairman_, to represent persons of either sex.  NOTE.--There is perhaps this distinction observed: when we speak of a female _as an active agent_ merely, we use the masculine termination, as, \"George Eliot is the _author_ of 'Adam Bede;'\" but when we speak purposely _to denote a distinction from a male_, we use the feminine, as, \"George Eliot is an eminent _authoress_.\"    III. Gender shown by Different Words.   32. In some of these pairs, the feminine and the masculine are entirely different words; others have in their origin the same root. Some of them have an interesting history, and will be noted below:--    bachelor--maid   boy--girl   brother--sister   drake--duck   earl--countess   father--mother   gander--goose   hart--roe   horse--mare   husband--wife   king--queen   lord--lady   wizard--witch   nephew--niece   ram--ewe   sir--madam   son--daughter   uncle--aunt   bull--cow   boar--sow  Girl originally meant a child of either sex, and was used for male or female until about the fifteenth century.  Drake is peculiar in that it is formed from a corresponding feminine which is no longer used. It is not connected historically with our word _duck_, but is derived from _ened_ (duck) and an obsolete suffix _rake_ (king). Three letters of _ened_ have fallen away, leaving our word _drake_.  Gander and goose were originally from the same root word. _Goose_ has various cognate forms in the languages akin to English (German _Gans_, Icelandic _gás_, Danish _gaas_, etc.). The masculine was formed by adding _-a_, the old sign of the masculine. This _gansa_ was modified into _gan-ra_, _gand-ra_, finally _gander_; the _d_ being inserted to make pronunciation easy, as in many other words.  Mare, in Old English _mere_, had the masculine _mearh_ (horse), but this has long been obsolete.  Husband and wife are not connected in origin. _Husband_ is a Scandinavian word (Anglo-Saxon _hūsbonda_ from Icelandic _hús-bóndi_, probably meaning house dweller); _wife_ was used in Old and Middle English to mean woman in general.  King and queen are said by some (Skeat, among others) to be from the same root word, but the German etymologist Kluge says they are not.  Lord is said to be a worn-down form of the Old English _hlāf-weard_ (loaf keeper), written _loverd_, _lhauerd_, or _lauerd_ in Middle English. Lady is from _hlœ̄̄fdige_ (_hlœ̄̄f_ meaning loaf, and _dige_ being of uncertain origin and meaning).  Witch is the Old English _wicce_, but wizard is from the Old French _guiscart_ (prudent), not immediately connected with _witch_, though both are ultimately from the same root.  Sir is worn down from the Old French _sire_ (Latin _senior_). Madam is the French _ma dame_, from Latin _mea domina_.   [Sidenote: _Two masculines from feminines._]  33. Besides _gander_ and _drake_, there are two other masculine words that were formed from the feminine:--  Bridegroom, from Old English _brȳd-guma_ (bride's man). The _r_ in _groom_ has crept in from confusion with the word _groom_.  Widower, from the weakening of the ending _-a_ in Old English to _-e_ in Middle English. The older forms, _widuwa_--_widuwe_, became identical, and a new masculine ending was therefore added to distinguish the masculine from the feminine (compare Middle English _widuer_--_widewe_).   Personification.   34. Just as abstract ideas are personified (Sec. 16), material objects may be spoken of like gender nouns; for example,--       \"Now, where the swift _Rhone_ cleaves _his_ way.\"--BYRON.       The _Sun_ now rose upon the right:      Out of the sea came _he_.      --COLERIDGE.       And haply the _Queen Moon_ is on _her_ throne,      Clustered around by all her starry Fays.      --KEATS,       _Britannia_ needs no bulwarks,      No towers along the steep;      _Her_ march is o'er the mountain waves,      _Her_ home is on the deep.      --CAMPBELL  This is not exclusively a poetic use. In ordinary speech personification is very frequent: the pilot speaks of his boat as feminine; the engineer speaks so of his engine; etc.  [Sidenote: _Effect of personification._]  In such cases the gender is marked by the pronoun, and not by the form of the noun. But the fact that in English the distinction of gender is confined to difference of sex makes these departures more effective.    NUMBER.   [Sidenote: _Definition._]  35. In nouns, number means the mode of indicating whether we are speaking of one thing or of more than one.   36. Our language has two numbers,--_singular_ and _plural_. The singular number denotes that one thing is spoken of; the plural, more than one.   37. There are three ways of changing the singular form to the plural:--  (1) By adding _-en_.  (2) By changing the root vowel.  (3) By adding _-s_ (or _-es_).  The first two methods prevailed, together with the third, in Old English, but in modern English _-s_ or _-es_ has come to be the \"standard\" ending; that is, whenever we adopt a new word, we make its plural by adding _-s_ or _-es._   I. Plurals formed by the Suffix _-en_.   [Sidenote: _The_ -en _inflection._]  38. This inflection remains only in the word oxen, though it was quite common in Old and Middle English; for instance, _eyen_ (eyes), _treen_ (trees), _shoon_ (shoes), which last is still used in Lowland Scotch. _Hosen_ is found in the King James version of the Bible, and _housen_ is still common in the provincial speech in England.   39. But other words were inflected afterwards, in imitation of the old words in _-en_ by making a double plural.  [Sidenote: -En _inflection imitated by other words._]  Brethren has passed through three stages. The old plural was _brothru_, then _brothre_ or _brethre_, finally _brethren_. The weakening of inflections led to this addition.  Children has passed through the same history, though the intermediate form _childer_ lasted till the seventeenth century in literary English, and is still found in dialects; as,--       \"God bless me! so then, after all, you'll have a chance to see      your _childer_ get up like, and get settled.\"--QUOTED BY DE      QUINCEY.  Kine is another double plural, but has now no singular.       In spite of wandering _kine_ and other adverse      circumstance.--THOREAU.   II. Plurals formed by Vowel Change.   40. Examples of this inflection are,--    man--men   foot--feet   goose--geese   louse--lice   mouse--mice   tooth--teeth  Some other words--as _book_, _turf_, _wight_, _borough_--formerly had the same inflection, but they now add the ending _-s_.   41. Akin to this class are some words, originally neuter, that have the singular and plural alike; such as _deer_, _sheep_, _swine_, etc.  Other words following the same usage are, _pair_, _brace_, _dozen_, after numerals (if not after numerals, or if preceded by the prepositions _in_, _by_, etc, they add _-s_): also _trout_, _salmon_; _head_, _sail_; _cannon_; _heathen_, _folk_, _people_.  The words _horse_ and _foot_, when they mean soldiery, retain the same form for plural meaning; as,--       The _foot_ are fourscore thousand,      The _horse_ are thousands ten.      --MACAULAY.       Lee marched over the mountain wall,--      Over the mountains winding down,      _Horse_ and _foot_, into Frederick town.      --WHITTIER.    III. Plurals formed by Adding -s or -es.   42. Instead of _-s,_ the ending _-es_ is added--  (1) If a word ends in a letter which cannot add _-s_ and be pronounced. Such are _box, cross, ditch, glass, lens, quartz_, etc.  [Sidenote: _-Es added in certain cases_.]  If the word ends in a _sound_ which cannot add _-s_, a new syllable is made; as, _niche--niches, race--races, house--houses, prize--prizes, chaise--chaises_, etc.  _-Es_ is also added to a few words ending in -o, though this sound combines readily with _-s_, and does not make an extra syllable: _cargo--cargoes, negro--negroes, hero--heroes, volcano--volcanoes_, etc.  Usage differs somewhat in other words of this class, some adding _-s_, and some _-es_.  (2) If a word ends in _-y_ preceded by a consonant (the _y_ being then changed to _i_); e.g., _fancies, allies, daisies, fairies_.  [Sidenote: _Words in -ies._]  Formerly, however, these words ended in _-ie_, and the real ending is therefore _-s_. Notice these from Chaucer (fourteenth century):--  [Sidenote: _Their old form._]       The _lilie_ on hir stalke grene.      Of _maladie_ the which he hadde endured.  And these from Spenser (sixteenth century):--       Be well aware, quoth then that _ladie_ milde.      At last fair Hesperus in highest _skie_      Had spent his lampe.  (3) In the case of some words ending in -_f_ or -_fe_, which have the plural in _-ves_: _calf_--_calves_, _half_--_halves_, _knife_--_knives_, _shelf_--_shelves_, etc.   Special Lists.   43. Material nouns and abstract nouns are always singular. When such words take a plural ending, they lose their identity, and go over to other classes (Secs. 15 and 17).   44. Proper nouns are regularly singular, but may be made plural when we wish to speak of several persons or things bearing the same name; e.g., _the Washingtons_, _the Americas_.   45. Some words are usually singular, though they are plural in form. Examples of these are, _optics_, _economics_, _physics_, _mathematics_, _politics_, and many branches of learning; also _news_, _pains_ (care), _molasses_, _summons_, _means_: as,--"]]]
