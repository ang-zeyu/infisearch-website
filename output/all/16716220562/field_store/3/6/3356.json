Tom, with his jaws set close, bent harder than ever at the oars.  \"Senor!\" wailed Nicolas, gaspingly.  \"If you do not go more easily I shall expire for lack of breath.  I cannot keep up with you.\"  Reade fell into a slower, stronger stroke.  \"Drop the oars any time you want to, Nicolas,\" Reade urged.  \"There won't be much more rowing to do, anyway.\"  Presently Tom himself rested on his oars, as the boat, moving under its own headway, approached the motor boat.  \"Going to board her on the quarter?\" the superintendent asked.  \"No; by the bow,\" Tom answered.  \"Let go the tiller ropes.  I'll pull alongside.\"  As they started to pass the boat a sound reached them that made Reade grow wild with anger.  Snore after snore, from five busy sleepers!  Tom pulled softly up to the bow.  \"There's the anchor cable!\" snorted Tom, Pointing to a rope that ran from the bow of the \"Morton\" down into the water.  \"Did you ever see more wicked neglect of important duty?  And not even a lantern out to mark her berth!  Get aboard, Mr. Renshaw, and go aft to start the engine.  Nicolas, you take this boat astern and make fast.  Don't wake the sleepers---poor, tired shirkers!\"  Tom, in utter disgust, leaped aboard the boat at the bow.  There, behind the wheel, Evarts lay on the floor of the boat, his rolled-up coat serving as a pillow.  Almost noiselessly Tom hauled up the light anchor.  Then he stood by the wheel.  \"All ready at the engine, Mr. Reade!\" called the superintendent, softly.  \"Let her go,\" Tom returned, \"as soon as Nicolas boards.\"  The Mexican was quickly aboard, after having made the rowboat's painter fast.  \"Headway!\" announced Renshaw, throwing over the drive-wheel of the engine.  \"Put-put-put!\" sputtered the motor.  Then the \"Morton\" began really to move.  With the first real throb of the engine the electric running lights gleamed out.  Aft Conlon began to stir.  Then he opened his eyes.  \"What---\" he began.  \"Silence!\" commanded Mr. Renshaw.  \"Tell me who's at the wheel?\" Conlon begged.  \"Mr. Reade,\" replied the superintendent, dryly.  \"Now, keep still!\"  \"Whew---ew---ew!\" whistled Conlon, in dire dismay.  Then he sank back, watching the engine with moody eyes.  The other three men aft still slept.  Presently Tom, in shifting his position, touched one foot lightly against the foreman's head.  Evarts half-awoke, then realized that the boat was moving.  \"Who started this craft against my orders?\" he drowsily demanded, as he sat up.  \"I did,\" Tom retorted witheringly, \"though I didn't hear your orders to the contrary.\"  \"You---Mr. Reade?\" gasped the foreman, leaping to his feet.  \"Yes---and a fine fellow you are to trust!\" Tom rejoined.  \"I leave you with very definite orders, and you go to sleep.  Then there's another explosion out on the wall and you sleep right along.\"  \"Another explosion?\" blurted Evarts, rubbing his eyes with his fists. \"Here, let me have that wheel, sir.  I'll have you out there quick!\"  \"You've nothing more to do here,\" Tom answered, dryly, without yielding the wheel.  \"What do you mean by that?\" Evarts cried quickly.  \"Can't you guess?\" wondered Reade.  \"Mr. Reade means,\" said Conlon, who had come forward, \"that we're fired---discharged.\"  \"Nonsense!\" protested Evarts.  \"Conlon has guessed rightly, as far as you're concerned,\" Tom continued. \"To-morrow, Evarts, you go to Mr. Renshaw and get your pay.  As for you, Conlon, you're not discharged this time.  Evarts admitted himself that it was he who gave positive orders to tie the boat up at anchor.  You were under his orders, so I can't hold you responsible.  Are you wide awake, now?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Conlon meekly.  \"Then go back and attend to your engine.  Look sharp for hail or bell.\"  \"I guess you'll find you can't quite get along without me,\" argued Evarts moodily.  \"You'll find that you need me to manage some of the men you've got.\"  \"You're through with this job, as I just did you the honor to inform you,\" Tom responded quietly.  \"To-morrow Mr. Renshaw will pay you off up to date.\"  \"If I'm bounced, then you'll pay me for the balance of the month, anyway!\" snarled the foreman defiantly.  \"You can't drop me without notice like that.\"  \"You'll be paid to date only,\" Tom retorted.  \"You've been discharged for wilful and serious neglect of duty, and you're not entitled to pay for the balance of the month.\"  \"All right, then,\" retorted the other hotly.  \"I'll collect my money through the courts.  I'll show you!\"  \"Just as you please,\" Reade replied indifferently.  \"But I imagine any court will consider seven dollars a day pretty large pay for a man who goes to sleep on duty.\"  \"See here, I'll---\"  \"You'll keep quiet, Evarts, or you'll go overboard,\" Reade interrupted significantly.  \"I happen to know that you can swim, so I won't be bothered with you here if you insist on making a nuisance of yourself.\"  Mr. Renshaw, having been relieved at the engine, now came forward.  \"Mr. Renshaw,\" directed the young chief engineer, \"as soon after daylight as it is convenient for you you'll pay Evarts off in full to date and let him go.  He threatens to sue if he is not paid to the end of the month, but if he wants to we'll let the courts do our worrying.\"  \"All right, sir,\" nodded the superintendent.  Evarts had dropped into a seat just forward of the engine.  He sat there, regarding Tom Reade with a baleful look of hate.  \"You're a success, all right, at one thing, and that's making enemies,\" muttered the discharged foreman under his breath.  Besides attending to the wheel Tom now reached out with one hand and switched on the search-light, which he manipulated with one hand.  Shortly he found the spot where the portion of the wall had been blown away by the first explosion.  A hundred and fifty yards farther out he beheld the work of the second explosion.  Some seventy-five yards in length was the new open space, where at least as much of the retaining wall as was visible above the water had been blown out.  \"Slow down, Cordon,\" ordered Tom.  \"All we want is headway.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  Tom drifted in within a few feet of the former site of the retaining wall. The \"Morton\" moved slowly by, Tom, by the aid of the searchlight, noting the extent of the disaster.  \"Get back aft, Evarts,\" ordered the young engineer, turning and beholding the late foreman.  \"We don't want you here.\"  For a moment or two it looked as though Evarts would refuse.  Then, with a growl, he rose and picked his way aft.  By this time the other men who had been in his gang were awake.  They regarded their former foreman with no great display of sympathy.  \"I'll confess I'm mystified,\" muttered Tom, watching the scene of the latest explosion for some minutes after the engine had been stopped. \"When daylight comes and we can use the divers we ought to know a bit more about how such a big blast is worked in the dead of night when the scoundrels ought to make noise enough to be heard.  It must have been a series of connected blasts, all touched off at the same moment, Mr. Renshaw, but even such a series is by no means easy to lay.  And then the blasts have to be drilled for, and then tamped.\"  \"As you say, sir,\" replied the superintendent, \"a much clearer idea can be formed when we have daylight and the divers.\"  Tom held his watch to one side of the searchlight.  \"Nearly two hours yet until daylight, Mr. Renshaw,\" he announced.  \"And, of course, it will be two or three hours after daylight before we can get the divers at work.  A fearful length of time to wait!\"  \"You'd better go back to the shore, sir,\" urged the superintendent.  \"Not while this boat needs to be run,\" objected Reade.  \"For the rest of the night I want a man here whom I can trust.\"  \"Will you trust me with the boat?\" proposed the superintendent.  \"Why, of course!\"  \"Then let me run back to the dock and put you ashore, Mr. Reade.  After that I'll come out here and patrol along the wall until broad daylight.\"  That was accordingly done.  The \"Morton\" lay alongside the dock, and Nicolas instantly busied himself with casting off the rowboat and making her fast to the pier instead.  Evarts sullenly remained in the boat.  \"Come on, Evarts,\" spoke Tom quietly.  \"Mr. Reade,\" expostulated the late foreman, \"I'm not going to be thrown out of my job like this.\"  \"Which especial way of being thrown out do you prefer then?\" Tom queried, dryly.  \"I'm not going to be put out of my job until I've had at least one good talk with you,\" insisted the foreman.  \"I'm afraid the time has passed for talking with you,\" Reade responded, turning toward the shore.  \"You lost a great chance, to-night, to serve the company with distinction, and your negligence cost the company a lot of money through the second explosion.  Are you coming out of that boat---or shall I come back after you?\"  Evarts rose, with a surly air.  He stepped slowly ashore, after which one of the crew cast off.  The engine began to move, and the \"Morton\" started back to her post.  \"Oh, you feel fine and important, just at this minute!\" grumbled the discharged foreman, under his breath, glaring wickedly at the broad back of the young chief engineer.  \"But I'll do something to take the importance out of you before very long, Tom Reade!\"  Truth to tell, Tom, though he was still alert to the interests of his employers, felt anything but important.  The thought of Harry Hazelton's unknown fate caused a great, choking lump in his throat as Reade stepped from the pier to land.     CHAPTER VI  MR. BASCOMB IS PEEVISH   At the first blush of dawn Tom despatched the tireless Nicolas to Blixton to notify the police of the explosions and of the disappearance of Harry Hazelton.  Two men in blue, wearing stars on their coats, came over within an hour, walked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14369"],["title","The Young Engineers on the Gulf (#7)"],["body","and looked wise until noon.  They discovered nothing whatever, and their theories did not strike Reade as being worthy of attention.  As soon as possible the divers were sent down at the two wrecked parts of the retaining wall.  These men reported that the breaches extended ten feet beneath the surface at some points; only eight feet at other points. The foundations of the walls were reported as being secure.  Then Tom, under the directions of two divers, put on a diver's suit and went down himself, for the first time in his life.  After some two hours, with frequent ascents to the surface, the young chief engineer had satisfied himself that the foundations were secure.  Then he did some rapid figuring.  \"The loss will not exceed eight thousand dollars---the cost of rebuilding the missing parts of the walls,\" Reade informed Superintendent Renshaw.  \"Only eight thousand dollars!\" whistled the superintendent.  \"Well, that figure isn't anywhere nearly as high as I feared it might be,\" Tom pursued.  \"But it will strike the directors of the Melliston Company as being pretty big for an extra bill,\" muttered Renshaw.  \"Especially, since---\"  The superintendent paused.  \"You were going to say,\" smiled Tom, wanly, \"since the loss wouldn't have happened if I hadn't kicked the gamblers out of camp.\"  \"That's about the size of it, Mr. Reade,\" nodded Renshaw.  \"Directors of big companies are less interested in moral reforms than in dividends. They're likely to make a big kick over what your crusade has cost them already, even if it costs them no more.\"  \"We'll see to it that it doesn't cost them any more,\" Tom retorted. \"Every night we'll watch that sea wall the way a mother does a sick baby. There'll be no more explosions.  As to the directors kicking over the present expense, they'll have a prompt chance to do it.  As soon as the telegraph office in Blixton was open this morning I wired the president of the company.  Now, I'm going ashore.  I can't do anything out here to help you, can I?\"  \"Nothing,\" replied Renshaw.  \"If I didn't know how foolish the advice would sound, Mr. Reade, I'd urge you to take a nap.\"  \"I'll take a nap when I find it impossible to keep my eyes open any longer,\" Tom compromised.  \"For the next few hours---work and lots of it.\"  As yet no effort had been made to repair the breaches in the wall.  The different gangs were working that day in nearer shore.  The divers, gathered on a scow, were now waiting for the \"Morton\" to convey them back to shore.  Reade decided to go with them.  \"Twenty minutes to two,\" murmured Tom to himself, glancing at his watch as the \"Morton\" went laboriously back over the dancing, glinting waves. \"There's a train due at Blixton at 1:30.  By the time I get back to the house I ought to find one or more officials of the company impatiently waiting to jump on my devoted neck.\"  Nor was Tom disappointed in this expectation.  Pacing up and down on the porch of the house occupied by the engineers and superintendent was George C. Bascomb, president of the Melliston Company.  Behind him stood Nicolas, respectfully eager to do anything he could for the comfort of the great man.  \"Ah, there you are, Reade,\" called President Bascomb in an irritated tone, as he caught sight of the young engineer striding forward.  \"Now, what's all this row that you wired us about?\"  \"Will you come down to the water, and go out with me to look at the damage, sir?\" asked Tom, as he took the president's reluctantly offered hand.  \"No,\" grunted Mr. Bascomb.  \"Let me hear the story first.  Come inside and tell me about it.\"  \"Our friend is not quite so gracious as he has been on former meetings,\" thought Tom, as he led the way inside.  \"I wonder if he is going to get cranky?\"  Inside was a little office room, as in the foremen's barracks.  \"Any decent cigars here?\" questioned Mr. Bascomb, after exploring his own pockets and finding them innocent of tobacco.  \"No, sir,\" Tom answered.  \"No one here smokes.\"  \"I've got to have a cigar,\" the president of the company insisted.  \"Then, sir, if you'll give Nicolas your orders, he'll run over to Blixton and get you what you want.\"  The Mexican departed in haste on the errand.  \"Now, first of all, Reade,\" began the president, \"I am disgusted at learning of one fool mistake that you've made.\"  \"What is that, sir?\" Tom asked, coloring.  \"I've just learned that you discharged Evarts---one of our best and most useful men.\"  \"I did discharge him, sir,\" Reade admitted.  \"Take him back, at once.\"  \"I'm sorry, sir, but I can't do it.  He---\"  \"I don't think you quite understand,\" broke in Mr. Bascomb coldly.  \"I directed you to take Mr. Evarts back on this work.\"  \"I was about to tell you, sir, why I can't do anything of the sort. I---\"  \"Stop right there, Reade,\" ordered President Bascomb, in his most aggressive, bullying manner.  \"The first point that we have to settle is that Evarts must come back on the pay-roll and have his old position.  Be good enough to let that proposition sink in before we take up the second.\"  \"I am very sorry, sir,\" Tom murmured respectfully, \"but I can't and won't have Evarts back here.  I won't have him around the work at all.  Now what is the second proposition, sir?\"  As Tom spoke he looked straight into Mr. Bascomb's eyes.  The other glared at him unbelievingly but angrily.  \"Young man, you don't appear to understand that I am president and head of the Melliston Company.\"  \"I quite understand it, sir,\" Reade answered.  \"At the same time I am chief engineer here, and I am committed to building the breakwater and dredging out the enclosed bay or harbor, all within a certain fixed appropriation. In order to keep my part of the bargain I must have men with me on whom I can depend to the fullest limit.  Evarts isn't such a man and I won't have him on the work again.\"  \"He'll go on the pay-roll, anyway,\" snorted Mr. Bascomb.  \"I can't help what you may see fit to pay him, Mr. Bascomb, provided you pay him somewhere else.  But the fellow can't go on the pay-roll here for the simple reason that he wouldn't be allowed to visit this construction camp for the purpose of getting his money.  Mr. Bascomb, I am not trying to ride a high horse.  I recognize that you are president of the company, and that I must take all reasonable orders from you and carry them out to the letter.  Yet I can't take any orders that would simply hinder my work and damage my reputation as an engineer.  Evarts can't come back into this camp as long as I am in charge here.\"  \"We'll take that up again presently,\" returned Mr. Bascomb, with an air of ruffled dignity.  \"Now, there's another matter that we must discuss.  I know what has been done in the way of great damage to the retaining wall. I also know that this damage came through enmity that you stirred up by drumming certain parties out of this camp.\"  \"You refer, sir, I take it, to my act in having Blixton police officers come in here and chase out some gamblers who had come here for the purpose of winning the money of the workmen?\"  \"That's it,\" nodded Bascomb.  \"In that matter you went too far---altogether too far!\"  \"I'm afraid I don't understand you, sir.\"  \"You mean, Reade, that you don't want to understand me,\" snapped the president.  \"You admit having chased out the gamblers, don't you?\"  \"Of course, I admit it, sir.\"  \"That was a bad move.  In the future, Reade, you will not interfere with any forms of amusement that the men may select for themselves in their evening hours.\"  Tom stared at the speaker in undisguised amazement.  \"But, Mr. Bascomb, the men are shamelessly robbed by the sharpers who come here to gamble with them.\"  \"That's the men's own affair,\" scoffed the president.  \"Anyway, they have a right to pitch away their wages if they want to.  Reade, when you're as old as I am you will understand that workmen who throw away their money make the best workmen.  They never have any savings, hence they must make every effort to keep their jobs.  A workman with savings becomes too independent.\"  \"I am certain you have seen more of the world than I have, Mr. Bascomb,\" Reade replied, respectfully.  \"At the same time I can't agree with you on the point you have just stated.  A workman with a bank account has always a greater amount of self-respect, and a man who has self-respect is bound to make a good citizen and a good workman.  But there are still other reasons why I had the gamblers chased out.  Gambling here in the camp would always create a great deal of disorder.  Disorder destroys discipline, and a camp like this, in order to give the best results in the way of work, must have discipline.  Moreover, the men, when gambling, remain up until all hours of the night.  A man who has been up most of the night can't give an honest day's work in return for his wages.  Unless the men get their sleep and are kept in good condition we can't get the work out of them that we have a right to expect.\"  \"The right man can _drive_ workmen,\" declared Mr. Bascomb, with emphasis. \"You'll have to drive your men.  Get all the work out of them, but drop at once this foolish policy of interfering with what they do after the whistle blows.  We can't have any more of this nonsense.  It costs too much.  By the way, how much will it cost to repair the damage to the retaining walls?\"  \"About eight thousand dollars, sir, if my first figuring was correct,\" was Reade's answer.  \"Eight thousand dollars!\" scowled President Bascomb.  \"Now, Reade, doesn't that amount of wanton, revengeful mischief teach you the folly of trying to regulate camp life outside of working hours?\"  \"I'm afraid it doesn't, sir.\"  \"Then you must be a fool, Reade!\"  \"Thank you, sir.  I will add that you're not the first man who has suspected it.\"  \"You will, therefore, Reade,\" continued Mr. Bascomb, with his grandest air of authority, \"cause it to become known throughout the camp that you are not going to interfere any further with any form of amusement that is"]]]
