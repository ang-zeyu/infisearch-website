I thought you were unusually quiet coming home: is anything amiss with you?\"  \"Oh, no, papa! I've had a lovely time all day long. How kind you were to give us all a holiday and let me go along with the rest of you.\"  \"Good to myself as well as to you, my darlings; I could have had very little enjoyment leaving you behind.\"  \"Papa, it's so nice to have you love me so!\" she said, kissing him with ardent affection. \"Oh, I do hope I'll never, _never_ be very naughty again!\"  \"I hope not, dear child,\" he responded, returning her caresses. \"I hope you feel ready to resume your studies to-morrow, with diligence and painstaking?\"  \"Yes, papa, I think I do. It's almost a week since you have heard me recite; except the Sunday lesson yesterday.\"  \"Yes,\" he said gravely, \"it has been something of a loss to you in one way, but I trust a decided gain in another. Well to change the subject, are you pleased with the prospect of spending the holidays at Ion?\"  \"Yes, papa; I think it will be lovely; almost as nice as having a party of our own, as we did last year.\"  \"Possibly we may add that--a party here for a day or two--if Grandma Elsie does not use up all the holidays with hers,\" he said in a half jesting tone and with a pleasant laugh.  \"O papa, do you really think we may?\" she cried in delight. \"Oh you are just the kindest father!\" giving him a hug.  He laughed at that, returning the hug with interest.  \"I suppose you and Eva and the rest were laying out plans for Christmas doings this afternoon?\" he said inquiringly.  \"Yes, papa, we were talking a good deal about games and tableaux, and about the things we could buy or make for gifts to our friends, and what we would like to have given us.\"  She paused, half hoping he would ask what she wanted from him, but he did not. He sat silently caressing her hair and cheek with his hand, and seemingly lost in thought.  At length, \"Papa,\" she asked half hesitatingly, \"are you very rich?\"  \"Rich?\" he repeated, coming suddenly out of his reverie and looking smilingly down into her eyes, \"yes; I have a sound constitution, excellent health, a delightful home, a wife and five children, each one of whom I esteem worth at least a million to me; I live in a Christian land,\" he went on in a graver tone, \"I have the Bible with all its great and precious promises, the hope of a blessed eternity at God's right hand, and that all my dear ones are traveling heavenward with me; yes, I am a very rich man!\"  \"Yes, sir; but--I meant have you a great deal of money.\"  \"Enough to provide all that is necessary for the comfort of my family, and to gratify any reasonable desire on the part of my little girl. What is it you want, my darling?\"  \"Papa, I'm almost ashamed to tell you,\" she said, blushing and hanging her head; \"but if I do, and you can't afford it, won't you please say so and not feel sorry about it? because I wouldn't ever want you to spend money on me that you need for yourself or some of the others.\"  \"I am glad you are thoughtful for others as well as yourself, daughter,\" he said kindly; \"but don't hesitate to tell me all that is in your heart. Nothing pleases me better than to have you, and all my dear children do so.\"  \"Thank you, my dear, dear papa. I don't mean ever to hide anything from you,\" she returned, giving him another hug and kiss, while her eyes sparkled and her cheek flushed with pleasure. \"It's a diamond ring I'd like to have.\"  \"A diamond ring?\" he repeated in surprise. \"What would my little girl do with such a thing as that?\"  \"Wear it, papa. Maud Dinsmore has such beautiful one, that a rich aunt sent her the other day,\" she went on eagerly; \"there's a large diamond in the middle and little ones all round it, and it sparkles so, and looks just lovely on her hand! We all admired it ever so much, and I said I'd be wild with delight if I had such an one; then Sydney said, 'Why not give your father a hint that you'd like one for Christmas?' and I said I was afraid you couldn't afford to give me anything that would cost so much; but Maud said I needn't be, for you were worth millions of money. Can you really afford to give it to me, papa? I'd like it better than anything else if you can, but if you can't I don't want it,\" she concluded with a sigh, and creeping closer into his embrace.  He did not speak for a moment, but though grave and thoughtful his countenance was quite free from displeasure,--and when, at length, he spoke, his tones were very kind and affectionate.  \"If I thought it would really be for my little girl's welfare and happiness in the end,\" he said, \"I should not hesitate for a moment to gratify her in this wish of hers, but, daughter, the ornament you covet would be extremely unsuitable for one of your years, and I fear its possession would foster a love of finery that I do not wish to cultivate in you, because it is not right, and would hinder you in the race I trust you are running for the prize of eternal life.  \"The Bible tells us we can not serve both God and Mammon; can not love him and the world too.  \"'If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.' God has entrusted me with a good deal of money, but I hold it as his steward, and 'it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.'\"  \"I don't know what you mean, papa,\" she said, with look and tone of keen disappointment.  \"That I must use the Lord's money to do his work, daughter; a great deal of money is needed to help on the advancement of his cause and kingdom in the hearts of individuals, and in the world at large. There are millions of poor creatures in heathen lands who have never so much as heard of Jesus and his dying love; and even in our own favored country there are thousands who are sunk in poverty, ignorance and wretchedness. Money is needed to feed and clothe them, to send them teachers and preachers, and to build churches, schools, and colleges, where they can be educated and fitted for happiness and usefulness.  \"Suppose I had a thousand, or five thousand dollars, to spare after supplying my family with all that is necessary for health, comfort and happiness; could my dear eldest daughter be so selfish as to wish me to put it into a diamond ring for her at the expense of leaving some poor creature in want and misery? some poor heathen to die without the knowledge of Christ? some soul to be lost that Jesus died to save?\"  \"Oh no, no, papa!\" she exclaimed, tears starting to her eyes, \"I couldn't be so hard hearted. I couldn't bear to look at my ring if it had cost so much to other people.\"  \"No, I am sure you could not; and I believe you would find far more enjoyment, a far sweeter pleasure, in selecting objects for me to benefit by the money the ring might cost.\"  \"O papa, how nice, how delightful that would be if you would let me!\" she cried joyously.  \"I will,\" he said; \"I have some thousands to divide among the various religious and benevolent objects, and shall give a certain sum--perhaps as much as a thousand dollars--in the name of each of my three children who are old enough to understand these things, letting each of you select the cause, or causes, to which his or her share is to go.\"  \"Which are the causes, papa?\" she asked, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.  \"There are Home and Foreign Missions, the work among the freedmen, and for the destitute in our own neighborhood, beside very many others. We will read about these various objects and talk the matter over together, and finally decide how many we can help, and how much shall be given to each. Perhaps you may choose to support a little Indian girl in one of the Mission schools, or some child in heathen lands; or a missionary who will go and teach them the way to heaven.\"  \"Oh I should love to do that!\" she exclaimed, \"it will be better than having a ring. Papa, how good you are to me! I am so glad God gave me such a father; one who tries always to teach me how to serve Him and to help me to be the right kind of a Christian.\"  \"I want to help you in that, my darling,\" he said; \"I think I could do you no greater kindness.\"  Just then Max came into the room, and his father called him to take a seat by his side, saying, \"I am glad you have come, my son, for I was about to speak to Lulu on a subject that concerns you quite as nearly.\"  \"Yes, sir; I'll be glad to listen,\" replied Max, doing as directed.  The captain went on. \"The Bible tells us, 'If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.' If we are like Jesus in spirit, we will love others and be ready to deny ourselves to do them good; especially to save their souls; for to that end he denied himself even to the shameful and painful death of the cross.  \"He says, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.... Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.'  \"That is we cannot be his disciples without doing something to bring sinners to him that they may be saved; something that will cost us self-denial; it may be of our own ease, or of something we would like to do or have.  \"And it must be done willingly, cheerfully, from love to the dear Master and the souls he died to save, and not as the way to earn heaven for ourselves.  \"We can not merit salvation, do what we will; we must take it as God's free, undeserved gift.\"  There was a moment of thoughtful silence; then Max said, \"Papa, I think I am willing if I knew just what to do and how to do it. Can you tell me?\"  \"You have some money of your own every week; you can give what you will of that to held spread abroad the glad tidings of salvation; you can pray for others, and when a favorable opportunity offers, speak a word to lead them to Christ. Ask God to show you opportunities and give you grace and wisdom to use them. Try also, so to live, and act, and speak, that all who see and know you will, take knowledge of you that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14534"],["title","Christmas with Grandma Elsie (#3)"],["body","have been with Jesus and learned of him.\"  \"Papa,\" said Lulu, \"won't you tell Max about the money you are going to give in our names?\"  \"No, I will let you have that pleasure,\" the captain answered with a kindly look and tone, and she eagerly availed herself of the permission.  Max was greatly pleased, and Violet, who joined them just in time to hear what Lulu was saying, highly approved.  \"But you will understand, children,\" the captain said, \"that this involves your gaining a great deal of information on the subject of missions, and other schemes of benevolence, and in order to help you in that, we will spend a short time each evening, when not prevented by company or some more important engagement, in reading and conversing on this topic.\"  \"I wish I could earn some money to give,\" said Lulu. \"I'd like to carve pretty things to sell; but who would buy them?\"  \"Possibly papa might become an occasional purchaser,\" her father said, stroking her hair and smiling kindly upon her.  \"Or Mamma Vi,\" added her young step-mother.  \"And I have another offer to make you both,\" said the captain; \"for every day that I find you obedient, pleasant-tempered and industrious I will give each of you twenty-five cents for benevolent purposes.\"  \"Thank you, papa,\" they both said, their eyes sparkling with pleasure; Max adding, \"That will be a dollar and seventy-five cents a week.\"  \"Yes; and for every week that either one of you earns the quarter every day, I will add another to bring it up to two dollars.\"  \"O papa, how nice!\" exclaimed Lulu. \"I mean to try very hard, so that I may have enough to support a little Indian girl. And is Gracie to have the same?\"  \"Certainly; and I shall not be greatly surprised if Gracie's missionary box fills faster than either of the others.\"  \"I am almost sure it will,\" said Lulu, sobering down a good deal; \"and Max's will be next. But I do mean to try ever so hard to be good.\"  \"I am quite sure you do, dear child,\" her father responded in tender tones. \"I know my little girl wants to improve, and I shall do all I can to help her.\"  \"Papa, is that quarter a day for good conduct, to be in addition to our usual pocket money?\" asked Max.  \"Certainly, my son; your pocket money is your own, to use for your pleasure or profit, except what you feel that you ought, or desire to give of it; but the quarter is expressly, and only for benevolent purposes.\"  \"When may we begin to earn it, papa?\"  \"To-morrow.\"  \"I'm glad of that,\" said Lulu with satisfaction, \"because I want to earn a good deal before Christmas.\"  Then she told of Evelyn's suggestions in regard to gifts for the poor in their immediate neighborhood.  \"A very good idea,\" her father said, \"and I think it may be carried out in a way to yield enjoyment to both givers and receivers.\"  \"I hope it will be cold enough at Christmas time to make ice and snow for sleighing and sledding,\" Max remarked; \"for we boys have planned to have a good deal of fun for ourselves and the girls too, if it is.\"  \"You mean if there is sleighing and sledding,\" his father said with an amused look. \"It might be cold enough, yet the needed snow or ice be lacking.\"  \"Why, yes, sir, to be sure, so it might!\" Max returned, laughing good humoredly.  \"What kind of fun is it you boys have planned for us girls?\" asked Lulu.  \"Never you mind,\" said Max; \"you'll see when the time comes; the surprise will be half of it you know.\"  \"My dear, you seem to me a very wise and kind father,\" Violet remarked to her husband when they found themselves alone together, after Max and Lulu had gone to their beds. \"I very highly approve of the plans you have just proposed for them. Though, of course the approval of a silly young thing, such as I, must be a matter of small consequence,\" she added, with a merry, laughing look up into his face.  \"Young, but not silly,\" he returned, with a very lover-like look and smile. \"I consider my wife's judgment worth a great deal, and am highly gratified with her approval. I am extremely desirous,\" he went on more gravely, \"to train my darlings to systematic benevolence, a willingness to deny themselves for the cause of Christ, and to take an interest in every branch of the work of the church.\"     CHAPTER III.   Lulu's first thought on awaking the next morning, was of the talk of the previous evening, with her father. He had said she might have the pleasure of telling Gracie the good news in regard to the money to be earned by good conduct, and that which was to be given by him in the name of each of his older children; also the privilege he would accord them of selecting the particular cause, or causes, to which the money should go.  Eager to avail herself of the permission, and see Gracie's delight, she sprang from her bed, ran to the door of communication between their sleeping rooms, which generally stood open--always at night--and peeped cautiously in.  Gracie's head was still on her pillow, but at that instant she stirred, opened her eyes, and called out in a pleased tone, \"O Lu, so you are up first!\" speaking softly though, for fear of disturbing their father and Violet, in the room beyond, the door there being open also.  Lulu hurried to it and closed it gently, then turning toward her sister, \"Yes,\" she said, \"but it's early, and you needn't get up just yet. I'm coming to creep in with you for a few minutes while I tell you something that I'm sure will please you.\"  She crept into Grace's bed as she spoke, and they lay for a while clasped in each other's arms, Lulu talking very fast, Grace listening and now and then putting in a word or two. She was quite as much pleased with what Lulu had to tell, as the latter had anticipated.  \"Oh won't it be just lovely to have so much money to do good with!\" she exclaimed when all had been told. \"Haven't we got the very best and dearest father in the world? I don't believe, Lu, there's another one half so dear and kind and nice. We ought to be ever such good children!\"  \"Yes, but I'm not,\" sighed Lulu. \"O Gracie, I'd give anything to be as good as you are!\"  \"Now don't talk so, Lu; you make me feel like a hypocrite; because I'm not good,\" said Grace.  \"You are; at any rate you're a great deal better than I am,\" asserted Lulu with warmth. \"You never disobey papa, or get into a passion; and I don't think you love finery as I do. Gracie, I want that ring yet; oh I should like to have it ever so much! and I oughtn't to want it; it's very selfish, because to buy it would use up money that ought to go to send missionaries to the heathen, or do good to some poor miserable creature; and it's wrong for me to want it, because papa says it wouldn't be good for me; and if I were as good as I ought to be I'd never want anything he doesn't think best for me to have. But, oh dear, how can I help it when I'm so fond of pretty things!\"  \"Lu,\" said Grace, softly, \"I do believe that if you ask the Lord Jesus to help you to quit wanting it, he will. But if you didn't care for it, it wouldn't be denying yourself to do without it for the sake of the heathen.\"  \"Maybe so; but I don't believe papa would let me have it even if I wouldn't consent to give it up, and begged him ever so hard for it.\"  \"No, I s'pose not, for he loves us too well to give us anything that he thinks will make it harder for us to love and serve God and go to heaven when we die.\"  \"Yes, and of course that's the best way for people to love their children. It's time for me to get up now, but you'd better lie still a little longer.\"  With that Lulu slipped from the bed, ran back to her room, and kneeling down there, gave thanks for the sleep of the past night, for health and strength, a good home, her dear, kind father to take care of, and provide for her, and love her, and all her many, many comforts and blessings; and confessing her sins, she asked to be forgiven for Jesus' sake, and to have strength given her to do all her duty that day,--to be patient, obedient, industrious, kind and helpful to others and willing to deny herself, especially in the matter of the ring she had been wishing for so ardently.  When the captain came into the apartments of his little daughters for a few minutes chat before breakfast, as was his custom, he found them both neatly dressed and looking bright and happy.  \"How are you, my darlings?\" he asked, kissing them in turn, then seating himself and drawing them into his arms.  \"I think we're both very well, papa,\" answered Lulu.  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Grace, \"and I'm ever so glad of what Lu's been telling me 'bout the money you are going to give us if we're good, and the choosing 'bout where the other shall go that you're going to give to help send missionaries to the heathen. Thank you for both, dear papa; but don't you think we ought to be good without being paid for it?\"  \"Yes, I certainly do, my dear little girl; but at the same time I want my children to have the luxury of being able to give something which they have, in some sense, earned for that purpose. I want you to learn in your own experience the truth of the words of the Lord Jesus, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'  \"Now while you are so young, not capable of earning much in any other way, your proper business the task of gaining knowledge and skill to fit you for future usefulness, I see no more fitting way than this for you to be furnished with money for religious and benevolent purposes.\"  \"Papa,\" asked Lulu, \"do you think it is never right for anybody to have diamonds or handsome jewelry of any kind?\"  \"I do not think it my business to judge in such matters for everybody,\" he answered, caressing her and smiling down tenderly into her eyes; \"but I must judge for myself--applying the rules the Bible gives me--and to a great extent for my children also while they are so young.\"  \"Not for Mamma Vi?\" Lulu asked, with some little hesitation.  \"No; she is my wife, not my child, and old enough to judge for herself.\"  \"She has a great deal of beautiful jewelry,\""]]]
