Notice, likewise, this method: Nap ca istutándauh, It is commanded not to lie.  So far of the verbs, which as well other parts of speech all the Indians use with nicety and elegance. For their conjugation, a single exemplar has been given; but their perfects and futures being differently formed, which are the roots whence the other tenses spring, they have been placed in the vocabulary added to the verbs, a knowledge of which will suffice to form all the other times.         *       *       *       *       *   PARTICIPLE.  42. The verbs become participles without undergoing change of form, as, hiósguam, I write, or he that writes, is the present participle; hiósguari, I have written, or he that has written; hiósguatze, I will write, or he that will, is the preterite (future?) participle. The same in its proportion is to be understood of the passive voice.  The _Present Participle_ is of the second declension, forming the genitive in te, thus Nominative, hiósguan; Genitive, hiósgnante, etc. The imperfect participle is of the same declension, with the difference that the mark of the imperfect, ru, is the final, as, Nom. hiósguamru, Gen. hiósguamteru, etc.  The _Perfect Participle_ is of the first declension, having its genitive in que, as, Nom. hiósguari, Gen. hiósguarique.  _Pluperfect Participle_ is declined like the perfect, observing what has been said of the imperfect, as, Nom. hiósguariru, Gen. hiósguariqueru, etc.  The _Future Participle_ belongs to the second declension, the genitive ending in te, preceded by n or m, as, Nom. hiósguatze, Gen. hiósguatzente.  The plural, it appears, should be declined in the same manner as the singular in respect of its termination in te or que.         *       *       *       *       *   PREPOSITION.  43. The prepositions that govern the genitive might with reason be called postpositions, since they follow the case; for Pedro Pedroque betzégnai, with you amó ma.         *       *       *       *       *   ADVERB.  The adverbs are very many, and by them more especially is expressed the manner of walking, of sitting, of sounding, etc., and oftentimes the enunciation copies after the sense, as, cúusan, I sound; catzcatze cúusan, clattering sound.         *       *       *       *       *   INTERJECTION.  45. Some of the interjections are these: Ari! and when repeated ari, ari! are those of one feeling pain; Asioma is of one that menaces, like, You will see! and Asma is like, I desire to see! Hábesa matzi, Well, then! Ahéne is exclaimed by one who recollects himself; Navehtzemne, Alas! Woe to me!         *       *       *       *       *   CONJUNCTION.  46. The conjunctions to the extent they can, will be treated of separately; for although the language of Indians is exact, there are difficulties to be encountered, and from those not brought up in their use, requiring special study.  47. The word _And_ is represented by aui, as, Nee aui nap, I and you, and also by vai placed afterward used in this way, Nee nap vai.  48. Whether the sentence consist of one or of two parts, this conjunction If is nowhere found, but the gerund in do or co is used; and in this manner should it be of a single part or an individual: If I do it well, I shall be content, hidénane éndo, or énco, nanacerátze; when of two, thus: If I did it well, you will be content, hidéna netzendo, or emco, nap nanacerátze: whence it may be seen that in the first passage is put the nominative nee, having but one part, and in the second the dative or accusative netz, since another member comes in which is nap, you. These are other examples: If I should be well, I will go to see you, Nee hidéna crádo, osét eme teuhdontze, which is an expression of one proposition, for though two persons enter there the action is single: If I shall have worked well you will pay me, Nee hidéna pananhriuhco, nap netz ovidetze, which is of two positions, the action being of two.  49. In the examples about to be given, it will be observed that _That_ is never used, whether it correspond to the quod or the ut of the Latin. Nee eme vitzán, nap hibe, I see that you are lax; Nee aguáteran, Domincotze amo misa ea vitzaca, I know that you have not heard mass Sunday; where vitzaca or vitzácauh is passive perfect, and the literal rendering is, I know, on Sunday your mass was not heard. I desire that you may live here, Nee eme iuide cáteo naquém, in which cáteo is an active perfect participle, and the verb naquém, I desire, ever requires this construction. The verb óqueem, I command, is peculiar likewise in one respect: in order to say I command you that you work, Nee eme panaúaoqueem is said; panaúaoqueem being composed of two words, of which panauatze, I will work, is from panaúan, work, the tze final being taken away and substituted by óqueem.  50. The equivalent of _Because_, nanévari, can be thus shown. I become angry because you are lax, Nee zínauan, ne néuari nap híbeen: with the particle aréde, which means because, it may be elegantly expressed, Nap híbeen, aredene zinauan, which, word for word, is, You are lax, for that I become angry. Here are other instances: Because I am sick I do not work, Nee ca panauan, nanéuarine cocotzem; in another manner, Nee cocotzem, arédene ca panauan, or Nee no cócotzihdade ca panauan, which corresponds to this, I, because of my infirmity, do not work. I come, because you called me, Nee eue hasi, naneuari nap netz ouíqui. Eue, signifying hither, is used because to the Indian ear, I came hither, is more euphonious than only I came. Nap netzoúiqui, arédene hási, I am glad, because you come to see me, Nee nánaceran, nanéuari nap netzeue teúhdóniueren, or otherwise, Nap netz eue teúhdóniueren arédene nanaceran.  51. The equivalent of _Before_ is caque, the translation of which is not yet. Before you could come I was already here, Nap caque hasdo nee vínu iuide énitude, of which hasdo is the gerund of hásem, that part of speech being thus used with caque, when it signifies before, and is literally, You not arrived yet, already was I here. Another instance: Before you can go, you will pay me: Caquena dado, netz ovidetze; also, Before the wheat could be planted, it rained: Perilon caque étzih dauh, duqui.  52. _After_ is rendered likewise by the gerunds with the adverb vaar, after. After he had sinned, he was converted to God: Varúhruco vaàr, Diosse vené are viranari, that is, having sinned afterward, etc.; and also it may be without vaár, as, After it had rained much, the river carried away the earth: Muic duco, bata guasta údari. Again: After the wheat had been cut, it got wet, and was lost: Pericon are tepúnaricoua sánhruco nasórtui.  53. _When_ may be rendered by héco, as, When you had come to see me, I had gone for wood: Hècona netz eue teuhdòni, nee cumandóniru. Another: When Christ had died, so much as was man died, and had not died so much as was God: Héco múcruco Cristo, are dóremcade muqui, are Diósemeade ca muqui; where also mucruco is gerund, and likewise may be said, héco muqui Cristo etc. If the question be asked, When? the accent is placed upon the last letter.  NUMERALS.  54, 55, 57. The native having counted to ten, says ten and one on it, etc., and at twenty says one man, sei dóhme, for the reason of that being his full number of fingers and toes: for forty he says, two men, got dóhme, and so on to a hundred, marqui dóhme. After twenty the count is the same as with the ten, twenty and one on it, etc. These numerals have also their inflections:    1, sei,    once, ses,            6, vusani,      six times, vusanis,   2, godum,  twice, gos,           7, seniovusáni, seven times, seniovusánis,   3, veidum, thrice, veis,         8, gos návoi,   eight times, gos návos,   4, nauoi,  four times, návos,    9, vesmácoi,    nine times, vesmácois,   5, marqui, five times, marquis, 10, macoi,       ten times, mácois.  The word _Already_, de, is thus added:    Gósade,    Márquisade,       Gosnavosade,   Veisade,   Vusánisade,       Vesmácoisade,   Navósade,  Seniovusánisade,  Mácoisade.  ORDINALS.  56. To form these the numerals are put in the ablative with in, _tze_, which is placed afterward as the prepositions ever are. Sétze, first; góctze, second; véictze, third; návoctze, fourth; márquitze, fifth; vusánitze, sixth; seniovásanitze, seventh; gosnávoctze, eighth; vesmácoitze, ninth; mácoitze, tenth. First is also called vatzut neréntze.  58. On the third day, is expressed, Veie queco; on the fourth day, Navoe queco, etc.         *       *       *       *       *   THE LORD'S PRAYER.  IN SPANISH AND HEVE.      Nuestro Padre, que estás en el cielo. Tu nombre sea     grandemente creido. A nosotros venga tu reino. Tu voluntad     aqui en la tierra se haga, come se hace en el cielo.

Thy name be greatly believed     in. To us come thy kingdom. Thy will here on earth be done, as     it is done in heaven. Our daily bread give us this day.

Amen.         *       *       *       *       *     VOCABULARY.     Acorn, _tohátacat_.   Adobe, _saamí_; to make _saamítaan_.   Air, _vaheia_.
