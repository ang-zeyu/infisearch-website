To playmates he was gentle as a girl;   Yet should the strong presume upon their strength   To overbear or wrong those weaker than themselves,   His sturdy arm and steady eye checked them,   And he would gently say, \"Brother, not so;   Our strength was given to aid and not oppress.\"   For in an ancient book he found a truth--   A book no longer read, a truth forgot,   Entombed in iron castes, and buried deep   In speculations and in subtle creeds--   That men, high, low, rich, poor, are brothers all,[10]   Which, pondered much in his heart's fruitful soil,   Had taken root as a great living truth   That to a mighty doctrine soon would grow,   A mighty tree to heal the nations with its leaves--   Like some small grain of wheat, appearing dead,   In mummy-case three thousand years ago[11]   Securely wrapped and sunk in Egypt's tombs,   Themselves buried beneath the desert sands,   Which now brought forth, and planted in fresh soil,   And watered by the dews and rains of heaven,   Shoots up and yields a hundred-fold of grain,   Until in golden harvests now it waves   On myriad acres, many thousand miles   From where the single ancient seed had grown.    Thus he grew up with all that heart could wish   Or power command; his very life itself,   So fresh and young, sound body with sound mind,   The living fountain of perpetual joy.   Yet he would often sit and sadly think   Sad thoughts and deep, and far beyond his years;   How sorrow filled the world; how things were shared--   One born to waste, another born to want;   One for life's cream, others to drain its dregs;   One born a master, others abject slaves.   And when he asked his masters to explain,   When all were brothers, how such things could be,   They gave him speculations, fables old,   How Brahm first Brahmans made to think for all,   And then Kshatriyas, warriors from their birth,   Then Sudras, to draw water and hew wood.   \"But why should one for others think, when all   Must answer for themselves?  Why brothers fight?   And why one born another's slave, when all   Might serve and help each other?\" he would ask.   But they could only answer: \"Never doubt,   For so the holy Brahmans always taught.\"   Still he must think, and as he thought he sighed,   Not for his petty griefs that last an hour,   But for the bitter sorrows of the world   That crush all men, and last from age to age.    The good old king saw this--saw that the prince,   The apple of his eye, dearer than life,   Stately in form, supple and strong in limb,   Quick to learn every art of peace and war,   Displaying and excelling every grace   And attribute of his most royal line,   Whom all would follow whereso'er he led,   So fit to rule the world if he would rule,   Thought less of ruling than of saving men.   He saw the glory of his ancient house   Suspended on an if--if he will rule   The empire of the world, and power to crush   Those cruel, bloody kings who curse mankind,   And power to make a universal peace;   If not this high career, with glory crowned,   Then seeking truth through folly's devious ways;   By self-inflicted torture seeking bliss,   And by self-murder seeking higher life;   On one foot standing till the other pine,   Arms stretched aloft, fingers grown bloodless claws,   Or else, impaled on spikes, with festering sores   Covered from head to foot, the body wastes   With constant anguish and with slow decay.[12]   \"Can this be wisdom?  Can such a life be good   That shuns all duties lying in our path--   Useless to others, filled with grief and pain?   Not so my father's god teaches to live.   Rising each morning most exact in time,   He bathes the earth and sky with rosy light   And fills all nature with new life and joy;   The cock's shrill clarion calls us to awake   And breathe this life and hear the bursts of song   That fill each grove, inhale the rich perfume   Of opening flowers, and work while day shall last.   Then rising higher, he warms each dank, cold spot,   Dispels the sickening vapors, clothes the fields   With waving grain, the trees with golden fruit,   The vines with grapes; and when 'tis time for rest,   Sinks in the west, and with new glory gilds   The mountain-tops, the clouds and western sky,   And calls all nature to refreshing sleep.   If he be God, the useful are like God;   If not, God made the sun, who made all men   And by his great example teaches them   The diligent are wise, the useful good.\"    Sorely perplexed he called his counselors,   Grown gray in serving their beloved king,   And said: \"Friends of my youth, manhood and age,   So wise in counsel and so brave in war,   Who never failed in danger or distress,   Oppressed with fear, I come to you for aid.   You know the prophecies, that from my house   Shall come a king, or savior of the world.   You saw strange signs precede Siddartha's birth,   And saw the ancient sage whom no one knew   Fall down before the prince, and hail my house.   You heard him tell the queen she soon would die,   And saw her sink in death as in sweet sleep;   You laid her gently on her funeral pile,   And heard my cry of anguish, when the sage   Again appeared and bade me not to weep   For her as dead who lived and loved me still.   We saw the prince grow up to man's estate,   So strong and full of manliness and grace,   And wise beyond his teachers and his years,   And thought in him the prophecies fulfilled,   And that with glory he would rule the world   And bless all men with universal peace.   But now dark shadows fall athwart our hopes.   Often in sleep the prince will start and cry   As if in pain, 'O world, sad world, I come!'   But roused, he'll sometimes sit the livelong day,   Forgetting teachers, sports and even food,   As if with dreadful visions overwhelmed,   Or buried in great thoughts profound and deep.   But yet to see our people, riding forth,   To their acclaims he answers with such grace   And gentle stateliness, my heart would swell   As I would hear the people to each other say;   'Who ever saw such grace and grandeur joined?'   Yet while he answers gladness with like joy,   His eyes seem searching for the sick and old,   The poor, and maimed, and blind--all forms of grief,   And oft he'd say, tears streaming from his eyes,[13]   'Let us return; my heart can bear no more.'   One day we saw beneath a peepul-tree   An aged Brahman, wasted with long fasts,   Loathsome with self-inflicted ghastly wounds,   A rigid skeleton, standing erect,   One hand stretched out, the other stretched aloft,   His long white beard grown filthy by neglect.   Whereat the prince with shuddering horror shook,   And cried, 'O world! must I be such for thee?'   And once he led the chase of a wild boar   In the great forest near the glacier's foot;   On Kantaka so fleet he soon outstripped   The rest, and in the distance disappeared.   But when at night they reached the rendezvous,   Siddartha was not there; and through the night   They searched, fearing to find their much loved prince   A mangled corpse under some towering cliff,   But searched in vain, and searched again next day,   Till in despair they thought to bring me word   The prince was lost, when Kantaka was seen   Loose-reined and free, and near Siddartha sat   Under a giant cedar's spreading shade.   Absorbed in thought, in contemplation lost,   Unconscious that a day and night had passed.   I cannot reason with such earnestness--   I dare not chide such deep and tender love,   But much I fear his reason's overthrow   Or that he may become like that recluse   He shuddered at, and not a mighty king   With power to crush the wrong and aid the right.   How can we turn his mind from such sad thoughts   To life's full joys, the duties of a king,   And his great destiny so long foretold?\"    The oldest and the wisest answered him:   \"Most noble king, your thoughts have long been mine.   Oft have I seen him lost in musings sad,   And overwhelmed with this absorbing love.   I know no cure for such corroding thoughts   But thoughts less sad, for such absorbing love   But stronger love.\"                    \"But how awake such thoughts?\"   The king replied.  \"How kindle such a love?   His loves seem but as phosphorescent flames   That skim the surface, leaving him heart-whole--   All but this deep and all-embracing love   That folds within its arms a suffering world.\"    \"Yes, noble king, so roams the antlered deer,   Adding each year a branch to his great horns,   Until the unseen archer lays him low.   So lives our prince; but he may see the day   Two laughing eyes shall pierce his inmost soul,   And make his whole frame quiver with new fire.   The next full moon he reaches man's estate.   We all remember fifty years ago   When you became a man, the sports and games,   The contests of fair women and brave men,   In beauty, arts and arms, that filled three days   With joy and gladness, music, dance and song.   Let us with double splendor now repeat   That festival, with prizes that shall draw   From all your kingdom and the neighbor states   Their fairest women and their bravest men.   If any chance shall bring his destined mate,   You then shall see love dart from eye to eye,   As darts the lightning's flash from cloud to cloud.\"   And this seemed good, and so was ordered done.    The king to all his kingdom couriers sent,   And to the neighbor states, inviting all   To a great festival and royal games   The next full moon, day of Siddartha's birth,   And offering varied prizes, rich and rare,   To all in feats of strength and speed and skill,   And prizes doubly rich and doubly rare   To all such maidens fair as should compete   In youth and beauty, whencesoe'er they came,   The prince to be the judge and give the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],["title","The Dawn and the Day (#4)"],["body","prize.    Now all was joy and bustle in the streets,   And joy and stir in palace and in park,   The prince himself joining the joyful throng,   Forgetting now the sorrows of the world.   Devising and directing new delights   Until the park became a fairy scene.    Behind the palace lay a maidan wide   For exercise in arms and manly sports,   Its sides bordered by gently rising hills,   Where at their ease the city's myriads sat   Under the shade of high-pruned spreading trees,   Fanned by cool breezes from the snow-capped peaks;   While north, and next the lake, a stately dome   Stood out, on slender, graceful columns raised,   With seats, rank above rank, in order placed,   The throne above, and near the throne were bowers   Of slender lattice-work, with trailing vines,   Thick set with flowers of every varied tint,   Breathing perfumes, where beauty's champions   Might sit, unseen of all yet seeing all.    At length Siddartha's natal day arrives   With joy to rich and poor, to old and young---   Not joy that wealth can buy or power command,   But real joy, that springs from real love,   Love to the good old king and noble prince.    When dawning day tinges with rosy light   The snow-capped peaks of Himalaya's chain,   The people are astir.  In social groups,   The old and young, companions, neighbors, friends,   Baskets well filled, they choose each vantage-ground,   Until each hill a sea of faces shows,   A sea of sparkling joy and rippling mirth.    At trumpet-sound all eyes are eager turned   Up toward the palace gates, now open wide,   From whence a gay procession issues forth,   A chorus of musicians coming first,   And next the prince mounted on Kantaka;   Then all the high-born, youth in rich attire,   Mounted on prancing steeds with trappings gay;   And then the good old king, in royal state,   On his huge elephant, white as the snow,   Surrounded by his aged counselors,   Some on their chargers, some in litters borne,   Their long white beards floating in every breeze;   And next, competitors for every prize:   Twelve archers, who could pierce the lofty swans   Sailing from feeding-grounds by distant seas   To summer nests by Thibet's marshy lakes,   Or hit the whirring pheasant as it flies--   For in this peaceful reign they did not make   Men targets for their art, and armor-joints   The marks through which to pierce and kill;   Then wrestlers, boxers, those who hurl the quoit,   And runners fleet, both lithe and light of limb;   And then twelve mighty spearmen, who could pierce   The fleeing boar or deer or fleet gazelle;   Then chariots, three horses yoked to each,   The charioteers in Persian tunics clad,   Arms bare, legs bare--all were athletes in power,   In form and race each an Apollo seemed;   Yoked to the first were three Nisaean steeds,[14]   Each snowy white, proud stepping, rangy, tall,   Chests broad, legs clean and strong, necks arched and high,   With foreheads broad, and eyes large, full and mild,   A race that oft Olympic prizes won,   And whose descendants far from Iran's plains   Bore armored knights in battle's deadly shock   On many bloody European fields;   Then three of ancient Babylonian stock,[15]   Blood bay and glossy as rich Tyrian silk--   Such horses Israel's sacred prophets saw   Bearing their conquerors in triumph home,   A race for ages kept distinct and pure,   Fabled from Alexander's charger sprung;   Then three from distant desert Tartar steppes,   Ewe-necked, ill-favored creatures, lank and gaunt,   That made the people laugh as they passed by--   Who ceased to laugh when they had run the race--   Such horses bore the mighty Mongol hosts[16]   That with the cyclone's speed swept o'er the earth;   Then three, one gray, one bay, one glossy black,   Descended from four horses long since brought   By love-sick chief from Araby the blest,   Seeking with such rare gifts an Indian bride,   Whose slender, graceful forms, compact and light,   Combined endurance, beauty, strength and speed--   A wondrous breed, whose famed descendants bore   The Moslem hosts that swept from off the earth   Thy mighty power, corrupt, declining Rome,   And with each other now alone contend   In speed, whose sons cast out, abused and starved,   Alone can save from raging whirlwind flames[17]   That all-devouring sweep our western plains;   Then stately elephants came next in line,   With measured step and gently swaying gait,   Covered with cloth of gold richly inwrought,   Each bearing in a howdah gaily decked   A fair competitor for beauty's prize,   With merry comrades and some sober friend;   The vina, bansuli, sitar and harp   Filling the air with sweetest melody,   While rippling laughter from each howdah rang,   And sweetest odors, as from op'ning flowers,   Breathed from their rich apparel as they passed.    And thus they circle round the maidan wide,   And as they pass along the people shout,   \"Long live the king! long live our noble prince!\"   To all which glad acclaims the prince responds   With heartfelt courtesy and royal grace.    When they had nearly reached the palace gate   On their return, the king drew to the right   With his attendants, while the prince with his   Drew to the left, reviewing all the line   That passed again down to the judges' seat,   Under the king's pavilion near the lake.   The prince eagerly watched them as they passed,   Noting their brawny limbs and polished arms,   The pose and skill of every charioteer,   The parts and varied breed of every horse,   Aiding his comrades with his deeper skill.   But when the queens of beauty passed him by,   He was all smiles and gallantry and grace,   Until the last, Yasodhara, came near,   Whose laugh was clearest of the merry crowd,   Whose golden hair imprisoned sunlight seemed,   Whose cheek, blending the lily with the rose,   Spoke of more northern skies and Aryan blood,   Whose rich, not gaudy, robes exquisite taste   Had made to suit her so they seemed a part   Of her sweet self; whose manner, simple, free,   Not bold or shy, whose features--no one saw   Her features, for her soul covered her face   As with a veil of ever-moving life.   When she came near, and her bright eyes met his,   He seemed to start; his gallantry was gone,   And like an awkward boy he sat and gazed;   And her laugh too was hushed, and she passed on,   Passed out of sight but never out of mind,   The king and all his counselors saw this.   \"Good king, our deer is struck,\" Asita said,   \"If this love cure him not, nothing can cure.\"   [1]Lieutenant-General Briggs, in his lectures on the aboriginal races of India, says the Hindoos themselves refer the excavation of caves and temples to the period of the aboriginal kings.  [2]The art of irrigation, once practiced on such a mighty scale, now seems practically a lost art but just now being revived on our western plains.  [3]\"And, that which all faire workes doth most aggrace, The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place.\"  --Faerie Queene, B. 2, Canto 12.  [4]See Miss Gordon Cumming's descriptions of the fields of wild dahlias in Northern India.  [5]By far the finest display of the mettle and blood of high-bred horses I have ever seen has been in the pasture-field, and this description is drawn from life.  [6]Once, coming upon a little prairie in the midst of a great forest, I saw a herd of startled deer bound over the grass, a scene never to be forgotten.  [7]See Miss Gordon Cumming's description of a hill covered with this luminous grass.  [8]There can be no doubt that the fire-worship of the East is the remains of a true but largely emblematic religion.  [9]The difference between the Buddhist idea of a deva and the Christian idea of an attendant angel is scarcely perceptible.  [10]The Brahmans claim that Buddha's great doctrine of universal brotherhood was taken from their sacred books and was not an originality of Buddha, as his followers claim.  [11]The Mediterranean or Egyptian wheat is said to have this origin.  [12]At the time of Buddha's birth there seemed to be no mean between the Chakravartin or absolute monarch and the recluse who had renounced all ordinary duties and enjoyments, and was subjecting himself to all deprivations and sufferings.  Buddha taught the middle course of diligence in daily duties and universal love.  [13]I am aware that some Buddhist authors whom Arnold has followed in his \"Light of Asia\" make Buddha but little better than a stale prisoner, and would have us believe that the glimpses he got of the ills that flesh is heir to were gained in spite of all precautions, as he was occasionally taken out of his rose embowered, damsel filled prison-house, and not as any prince of high intelligence and tender sensibilities who loved his people and mingled freely with them would gain a knowledge of suffering and sorrow; but we are justified in passing all such fancies, not only on account of their intrinsic improbability, but because the great Asvaghosha, who wrote about the beginning of our era, knew nothing of them.  [14]To suppose that the Aryan races when they emigrated to India or Europe left behind them their most valuable possession, the Nisaean horse, is to suppose them lacking in the qualities of thrift and shrewdness which have distinguished their descendants.  That the Nisaean horse of the table-lands of Asia was the horse of the armored knights of the middle ages and substantially the Percheron horse of France, I had a curious proof: In Layard's Nineveh is a picture of a Nisaean horse found among the ruins, which would have been taken as a good picture Of a Percheron stallion I once owned, who stood for the picture here drawn of what I regard as his undoubted ancestor.  [15]Marco Polo speaks of the breed of horses here attempted to be described as \"excellent, large, strong and swift, said to be of the race of Alexander's Bucephalus.\"  [16]It is said that the Mongolians in their career of conquest could move an army of 500,000 fifty miles a"]]]
