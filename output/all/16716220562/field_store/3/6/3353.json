Conclusion     CHAPTER I  THE MYSTERY OF A BLACK NIGHT   \"I wish I had brought my electric flash out here with me,\" muttered Harry Hazelton uneasily.  \"I told you that you'd better do it,\" chuckled Tom Reade.  \"But how could I know that the night would be pitch dark?\" Harry demanded. \"I don't know this gulf weather yet, and fifteen minutes ago the stars were out in full force.  Now look at them!\"  \"How can I look at them?\" demanded Tom, halting.  \"My flashlight won't pierce the clouds.\"  Reade halted on his dark, dangerous footway, and Harry, just behind him, uttered a sigh of relief and halted also.  \"I never was in such a place as this before.\"  \"You've been in many a worse place, though,\" rejoined Tom.  \"I never heard you make half as much fuss, either.\"  \"I think something must be wrong with my head,\" ventured Harry.  \"Undoubtedly,\" Tom Reade agreed cheerily.  \"Hear that water,\" Harry went on, in a voice scarcely less disconsolate than before.  \"Of course,\" nodded Tom.  \"But the water can hardly be termed a surprise. We both knew that the Gulf of Mexico is here.  We saw it several times to-day.\"  The two young men stood on a narrow ledge of stone that jutted out of the water.  This wall of stone was the first, outer or retaining wall of masonry---the first work of constructing a great breakwater.  At high tide, this ledge was just fourteen inches above the level surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and at the time of the above conversation it was within twenty minutes of high tide.  The top of this wall of masonry was thirty inches wide, which made but a narrow footway for the two youths who, on a pitch black night, were more than half a mile out from shore.  On a pleasant night, for a young man with a steady head, the top of this breakwater wall did not offer a troublesome footpath.  In broad daylight hundreds of laborers and masons swarmed over it, working side by side, or on scows and dredges alongside.  \"Wait, and I'll show a light,\" volunteered Tom raising his foot-long flashlight.  Some seventy-five yards behind them a crawling snake-like figure flattened itself out on the top of the rock wall.  \"Don't show the light just yet,\" pleaded Harry.  \"It might only make me more dizzy.\"  The flattened figure behind them wriggled noiselessly along.  \"Just listen to the water,\" continued Hazelton.  \"Tom, I'm half-inclined to think that the water is roughening.\"  \"I believe it is,\" agreed Tom.  \"Fine time we'll have getting back, if a gale springs up from the southward,\" muttered Harry.  \"See here, old fellow,\" interposed Tom vigorously, \"you're not up to concert pitch to-night.  Now, I'll tell you what I'll do---first of all, what _you'll_ do.  You sit right down flat on the top of the wall.  Then I'll move on up forward and see what has been happening out there that should boom shoreward with such a racket.  You stay right here, and I'll be back as soon as I've looked into the face of the mystery.\"  \"What do you take me for?\" Harry asked almost fiercely.  \"A baby?  Or a cold-foot?\"  \"Nothing like it,\" answered Tom Reade with reassuring positiveness. \"You're out of sorts, to-night.  Your head, or your nerves, or some thing, has gone back on you, and you walk through this blackness with half a notion that you're going to walk over a precipice, or drop head-first into some danger.  With such a feeling it would be cruelty to let you go forward, chum, and I'm not going to do it.  I'll go alone.\"  The crouching figure to the rear of the young engineers quivered as though this separation of the two engineers on this black night was a thing devoutly to be desired.  \"You're not going to do anything of the sort,\" retorted Harry Hazelton. \"I'm going forward with you.  I'm going to stick to you.  All I wanted was a minute in which to brace myself.  I've had that minute.  Now get forward with you.  I'm on your heels!\"  Tom Reade shrugged his shoulders slightly.  However, he did not object or argue, for he realized that his chum was sensitive over any circumstance that seemed to point to sudden failure of his courage.  \"Come along, then,\" urged Tom.  \"Wait just a second, though.  I'll flash the light ahead along the wall, to show you that it's all there, and just where it lies.\"  A narrow beam of light shot ahead as Tom pressed the spring of his pocket flash lamp.  A weird enough scene the night betrayed.  In perspective the wall ahead narrowed, until the two sides seemed to come to a point.  Back of all was the thick curtain of black that had settled down over the gulf.  A little farther out, too, the water seemed rougher.  There would seem to be hardly a doubt that a gale was brewing.  \"Shut that light off!\" Hazelton commanded, fighting to repress a shudder. \"I can do better in the darkness.  Now, go ahead, and I'll follow.\"  Tom started, but he went slowly now, feeling that this pace was more suited to the condition of his chum's nerves.  Harry followed resolutely, though none but himself knew how much effort it took for him to keep on in the face of such a nameless yet terrible dread as now assailed him.  To the rear a bulky, hulking figure rose and stood erect.  With the softest of steps this apparition of the night followed after them, until it stole along, ghost-like, just behind Hazelton.  Then a huge arm was raised, threateningly, over Harry's head.  At that particular moment, as though insensibly warned, Hazelton stopped, half-wheeling.  In the next second Harry bounded back just out of reach of the descending arm, the hand of which held something.  But in that backward spring Harry, in order to save himself from pitching into the water, was oblige to turn toward Reade.  \"Tom!\" exploded the young engineer.  \"Flash the light here quickly!\"  In the instant, however, that Harry had sprung backward the figure had slipped noiselessly into the water to the left.  As Reade wheeled about, throwing on the light, he let the ray fall in the water to the right of the wall.  But no sign of the intruder appeared; the water had closed noiselessly over the now vanished figure.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Reade, as he stood looking, then finally flashed his light over to the other side of the wall.  \"I saw---\" began Hazelton.  Then changed to: \"I thought---er---I saw---oh, nonsense!  You'll josh the life out of me!\"  \"Not I,\" Tom affirmed gravely, as a thrill of pity, for what he deemed his friend's unfortunate \"nervous condition,\" shook him.  \"Tell me what you saw, Harry.\"  \"Why, I thought I saw a big fellow---a black man, too---right behind me, arm upraised, just ready to strike me.\"  \"Well, where is he?\" Tom demanded blankly, flashing the light on either side of the narrow wall-top.  \"See him anywhere now, chum?\"  Harry didn't.  In fact, he hardly more than pretended to look.  The thing that had been so real a moment before was now utterly invisible.  Hazelton began to share his chum's suspicion as to the utter breakdown of his nerves and powers of vision.  \"It was nothing, of course,\" said Harry, shamefacedly, but Tom vigorously took the other side of the question.  \"See here, Harry, it must have been something,\" insisted Reade.  \"You're not dreaming, and you're not crazy.  It would take either one of those conditions to make you see something that didn't really exist.  No mere nervous tremor is going to make you see something as tall as a man, standing right over you, when no such thing exists.\"  \"Well, then, where is the fellow?\" Harry Hazelton demanded, helplessly, as he stared about.  \"There isn't any human being but ourselves in sight, either on the wall or in the water.  Your light shows that.\"  The light did not quite show that, and could not, since the huge prowler was now swimming gently under water, some seven or eight feet from the surface.  \"We'll have to solve the question before we leave here,\" declared Tom. \"We can't have folks following us up in a ticklish place like this. Besides, Harry, I'm willing to wager that your vision---whatever it was---has some real connection with the mystery that we're going out yonder to investigate.  So we'll solve the puzzle that's right here before we go forward to look at the bigger riddle that the dark now hides from us out yonder.  Use your eyes, lad, an I'll do the same with mine!\"  Neither Tom Reade nor Harry Hazelton are strangers to the readers of this series, nor of the series that have preceded the present one.  Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, now engineers in charge of a big breakwater job on the Alabama gulf coast, were first introduced to our readers in the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_.\"  There we met them as members of that immortal band of American schoolboys known as Dick & Co.  Back in the old school days Dick Prescott had been the leader of Dick & Co., though, as all our readers know, Prescott was not the sole genius of Dick & Co.  Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell and Tom and Harry had been the other members of that famous sextette of schoolboy athletes.  After reading of the doings of Dick & Co. in the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_,\" our readers again followed them, through the events recorded in the four volumes of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14369"],["title","The Young Engineers on the Gulf (#1)"],["body"," \"_High School Boys Series_\". Here their really brilliant work Boys Series athletes was stirringly chronicled, as along with scores of non-athletic adventures that befell them.  At the close of the high school course Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes secured appointments as cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point.  All that befell them there is duly set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell were fortunate enough to secure appointments as midshipmen in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and their doings there are set forth in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, on the other hand, had felt no call to military glory.  For their work in life they longed to become part of the great constructive force wielded by modern civil engineers.  During the latter part of their high school work they had studied hard with ambition to become surveyors and civil engineers.  In their school vacations they had sought training and experience in the offices of an engineering firm in their home town of Gridley.  After being graduated from the Gridley High School, Tom and Harry had done more work in the same offices.  Then, in a sudden desire for advancement, and possessed by the longing for a wider field of endeavor, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton had secured positions as \"cub engineers\" on the construction work that was being done to rush a new railway, system over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.  The stern, hard work that lay before them, the many adventures in a rough wilderness, and the chain of circumstances that at last placed Tom Reade in charge of the railroad building, with Harry as first assistant engineer, are all told in the first volume of this present series, \"_The Young Engineers In Colorado_.\"  That great feat finished satisfactorily, the ambition of our young engineers led them further afield, as told in \"_The Young Engineers in Arizona_.\"  A great, man-killing quicksand had to be filled in and effectively stopped from shifting.  Reade & Hazelton undertook the task. Incidentally Tom came into serious, dangerous conflict with gamblers and other human birds-of-prey, who had heretofore fattened on the earnings of the railway laborers.  It was a tremendously exciting time that the young engineers had in Arizona, but they at last got away with their lives and were at the same time immensely successful in their undertaking.  In \"_The Young Engineers In Nevada_\" we found our young friends under changed conditions.  While at work in Colorado and in Arizona Tom and Harry had studied the occurrence of precious ores, and also the methods of assaying and extracting ores.  Having their time wholly to themselves after finishing in Arizona the dauntless young pair went to Nevada, there to study mining at first hand.  In time they located a mining claim, though there were other claimants, and around this latter fact hung an extremely exciting story.  Both young engineers nearly lost their lives in Nevada, and met with many strenuous situations.  Their sole idea in pushing their mine forward to success was that the money so earned would enable them to further their greatest ambition; they longed to have their own engineering offices.  In the end, their mine, which the young engineers had named \"The Ambition,\" proved a success.  Thereupon they left their mining partner, Jim Ferrers, in charge and went east to open their offices.  We next found the young engineers engaged to the south of the United States border.  These adventures were fully set forth in the preceding volume in this series, entitled \"_The Young Engineers in Mexico_.\"  Tom and Harry, engaged to solve some problems in a great Mexican mine, found themselves the intended tools of a pair of mine swindlers of wealth and influence. From their first realization of the swindle Tom and Harry, even in the face of threats of assured death, held out for an honest course.  How they struggled to save a syndicate of American investors from being swindled out of millions of dollars was splendidly told in that fourth volume.  And now we find our young friends down at the gulf coast town of Blixton, Alabama.  Here they are engaged in a kind of engineering work wholly unlike any they had hitherto undertaken.  The owners of the Melliston Steamship Line, with a fleet of twenty-two freight steamships engaged in the West Indian and Central American trade, had looked in vain for suitable dock accommodations for their vessels, worth a total of more than six million dollars.  In their efforts to improve their service the Melliston owners had found at Blixton a harbor that would have suited them excellently, but for one objection.  The bay at Blixton was too open to shelter vessels from the severity of some of the winter gales.  Up to the present time Blixton had not been used for harbor purposes.  But the Melliston owners had conceived the idea that a great breakwater could be so built as to shelter the waters of the bay.  They had quietly bought up most of the shore front of the little town, which had railway connection.  Then they had searched about for engineers capable of building the needed breakwater.  Reade & Hazelton, hearing of the project, had applied for the work.  As the young men furnished most excellent recommendations from former employers they had finally secured the opportunity.  By no means was the task an easy one, as will presently be shown.  It was a work that would have to be carried on in the very teeth of jealous Nature.  Tom and Harry were fully aware of the great difficulties that lay before them.  What they did not know was that they would presently have to contend, also, with forces set loose by wicked human minds.  What started these untoward forces in operation, and how the forces worked out, will soon be seen.  Captain of a queer crew was Tom Reade, and Harry was his lieutenant.  Of the laborers, seven hundred in number, some four hundred were negroes; there were also two hundred Italians and about a hundred Portuguese.  Many, of each race, were skilled masons; others were but unskilled laborers. There were six foremen, all Americans, and a superintendent, also American. There were a few more Americans and two or three Scotchmen, employed as stationary engineers and in similar lines of work.  A touch of the old Arizona trouble had invaded the camp.  There had recently been a pay-day, and gamblers had descended upon the camp of tents and shanties.  Once more Reade had driven off the gamblers, though this time with less trouble than in Arizona.  At Blixton, Tom had merely sent for the four peace officers in the town of Blixton, and had had the gamblers warned out of camp.  They had gone, but there had been wrathful mutterings among many of the workmen.  The camp was a half mile back from the water's edge, on a low hillside. Here the men of the outfit were settled.  There had been mutinous mutterings among some of the men, but so far there had been no open revolt.  Tom, however, who had had considerable experience in such matters, looked for some form of trouble before the smouldering excitement quieted.  So did Harry.  On this dark night Tom had proposed that he and his chum take a stroll down to the shore front to see whether all were well there.  Soon after leaving camp behind, the young engineers had started on a jog-trot.  Just before they reached the water's edge the wind had borne to their ears the faint report of what must have been an explosion out over the waters of the gulf.  \"Trouble!\" Tom whispered in his chum's ear.  \"Most likely some of the rascals that we drove out of camp have been trying to set back our work with dynamite.  If they have done so we'll teach 'em a lesson if we can catch them!\"  So the young engineers had started out over their narrow retaining wall. We have seen how they had walked most of the distance when Harry had had his sudden warning of the hostile arm uplifted over his head.  \"What could it have been?\" demanded Tom in a low voice, as he continued to cast the light from his flash lamp out over the waters on either side of the wall.  \"It must have been my nervous imagination,\" admitted Harry.  \"Whew!  But it _did_ seem mighty real for the moment.\"  \"Then you're inclined, now, to believe that it was purely imagination?\" pursued Tom.  \"Ye---e---es, it must have been,\" assented Harry reluctantly.  Tom made some final casts with the light.  While they were conversing, well past the short radius of the flash lamp's glare, a massive black head bobbed up and down with the waves.  Out there the huge negro who had swiftly vanished from the wall, and who had swum under water for a long distance, was indolently treading water.  Wholly at home in the gulf, the man's black head blended with the darkness of the water and the blackness of the night.  \"Oh, then,\" suggested Reade, \"we may as well go along on our way.  Plainly there's nothing human around here to look at but ourselves.\"  So they started slowly forward over the wall.  Leisurely the black man swam to the wall, taking up the dogged trail again in the darkness behind the pair of young engineers.  Several minutes more of cautious walking brought Tom Reade to a startled halt.  \"Look there, Harry!\" uttered Reade, stopping and throwing the light ahead.  Out beyond them, not far from the end of the wall, some hundred feet of the top had been torn away.  For all the young engineers could see, the foundations might have gone with the superstructure.  \"Dynamite!\" Tom muttered grimly.  \"So this is the way our newly-found enemies will fight us?\"  \"It won't be such a big job to repair this gap,\" muttered Harry calmly.  \"No; but it'll take a good many dollars to pay the bills,\" retorted Tom.  \"Well, the expense can't be charged to us, anyway,\" maintained Harry.  \"We didn't do this vandal's work, and we didn't authorize its being done.\"  \"No; but you know why it was done, Harry,\"  Tom continued.  \"It was because we drove the "]]]
