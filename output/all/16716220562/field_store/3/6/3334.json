To do the other would be to obtain the position by fraud--to steal it, as a thief steals things that _he_ wants. No sort of atonement is possible, is even worth the name, if it is backed up by deceit, Mr. Cleek.\"  \"Even though that deceit is the only thing that could give you your heart's desire? The only thing that could open the Gates of Heaven for you?\"  \"The 'Gates of Heaven,' as you put it, can never be opened with a lie, Mr. Cleek. They might be opened by the very thing of which you speak--confession. I think I should take my chances upon that. At any rate, if I failed, I should at least have preserved my self-respect and done more to merit what I wanted than if I had secured it by treachery. Think of the boy you helped a little while ago. How much respect will you have for him if he never lives up to his promise; never goes to Clarges Street at all? Yet if he does live up to it, will he not be doubly worth the saving? But please!\" with a sudden change from seriousness to gaiety, \"if I am to be led into sermonizing, might I not know what it is all about? I shall be right, shall I not, in supposing that all this is merely the preface to something else?\"  \"Either the Preface or--the Finis,\" said Cleek, with a deeply drawn breath. \"Still, as you say, no atonement is worth calling an atonement if it is based upon fraud; and so--Miss Lorne, I am going to ask you to indulge in yet another little flight of fancy. Carry your mind back, will you, to the night when your cousin--to the night two years ago when Sir Horace Wyvern's daughter had her wedding presents stolen and you, I believe, had rather a trying moment with that fellow who was known as 'The Vanishing Cracksman.' You can remember it, can you not?\"  \"Remember it? I shall never forget it. I thought, when the police ran down stairs and left me with him, that I was talking to Mr. Narkom. I think I nearly went daft with terror when I found out that it was he.\"  \"And you found it out only through his telling you, did you not? Afterward, I am told, the police found you lying fainting at the foot of the stairs. The man had touched you, spoken to you, even caught up your hand and put it to his lips? Can you remember what he said when he did that? Can you?\"  \"Yes,\" she answered, with a little shudder of recollection. \"For weeks afterward I used to wake up in the middle of the night thinking of it and going cold all over. He said, 'You have come down into Hell and lifted me out. Under God, you shall lift me into Heaven as well!'\"  \"And perhaps you shall,\" said Cleek, stopping short and uncovering his head. \"At any rate, I'll not attempt to win it by fraud. Miss Lorne, I am that man. I am the 'Vanishing Cracksman' of those other days. I've walked the 'straight path' since the moment I kissed your hand.\"  She said nothing, made no faintest sound. She couldn't--all the strength, all the power to do anything but simply stand and look at him had gone out of her. But even so, she was conscious--dimly but yet conscious--of a feeling of relief that they had come at last close to the end of the heath, that there was the faint glow of lights dimly observable through the enfolding mist, and that there was the rumble of wheels, the pulse of life, the law-guarded paths of the city's streets beyond.     CHAPTER III   She could not herself have been more conscious of that feeling of relief than he was of its coming. It spoke to him in the swift glance she gave toward those distant, fog-blurred lights, in the white, drained face of her, in the shrinking backward movement of her body when he spoke again; and something within him voiced \"the exceeding bitter cry.\"  \"I am not sure that I even hoped you would take the revelation in any other way than this,\" he said. \"A hawk--even a tamed one--must be a thing of terror in the eyes of a dove. Still, I am not sorry that I have made the confession, Miss Lorne. When the worst has been told, a burden rolls away.\"  \"Yes,\" she acquiesced faintly, finding her voice; but finding it only to lose it again. \"But that you--that _you_....\" And was faint and very still again.  \"Shall we go on? It isn't more than fifty paces to the road; and you may rely upon finding a taxicab there. Would you like me to show you the way?\"  \"Yes, please. I--oh, don't think me unsympathetic, unkind, severe. It is such a shock; it is all so horrible--I mean--that is.... Let me get used to it. I shall never tell, of course--no, never! Now, please, may we not walk faster? I am very, very late as it is; and they will be worrying at home.\"  They did walk faster, and in a minute more were at the common's end. Cleek stopped and again lifted his hat.  \"We will part here, Miss Lorne,\" he said. \"I won't force my company on you any further. From here, you are quite beyond all danger, and I am sure you would rather I left you to find a taxi for yourself. Good night.\" He did not even offer to put out his hand. \"May I say again, that I am not sorry I told you? Nor did I ever expect you would, take it other than like this. It is only natural. Try to forgive me; or, at the least, believe that I have not tried to keep your friendship by a lie, or to atone in seeming only. Good night.\"  He gave her no chance to reply, no time to say one single word. Deep wounds require time in which to heal. He knew that he had wounded the white soul of her so that it was sick with uncertainty, faint with dread; and, putting on his hat, stepped sharply back and let the mist take him and hide him from her sight.  But, though she did not see, he was near her even then.  He knew when she walked out into the light-filled street; he knew when she found a taxicab; and he did not make an effort to go his way until he was sure that she was safely started upon hers. Then he screwed round on his heel and went back into the mist and loneliness of the heath, and walked, and walked, and walked. Afterward--long afterward: when the night was getting old and the town was going to sleep, he, too, fared forth in quest of a taxi, and finding one went _his_ way as she had gone hers.  In the neighbourhood of Bond Street--now a place of darkness and slow-tramping policemen--he dismissed the taxi and continued the journey along Piccadilly afoot. It was close to one o'clock when he came at length to Clarges Street and swung into it from the Piccadilly end, and moved on in the direction of the house which sheltered him and his secrets together. But, though he walked with apparent indifference, his eye was ever on the lookout for some chance watcher in the windows of the other houses; for \"Captain Horatio Burbage\" was supposed, in the neighbourhood, to be a superannuated seaman who maintained a bachelor establishment with the aid of an elderly housekeeper and a deaf-and-dumb maid of all work.  But no one was on the watch to-night; and it was only when he came at last to the pillared portico of his own residence that he found any sign of life from one end of the street to the other. He did find it then, however; for the boy, Dollops, was sitting huddled up on the top step with the thick shadow of the portico making a safe screen for him.  He had made good use of the two half-crowns, for he had not only feasted--and was feasting still: on a bag of winkles and a saveloy--but was washed and brushed and had gone to the length of a shoe-shine and a collar.  \"Been waitin' since eleven o'clock, sir,\" he said, getting up and pulling his forelock as Cleek appeared. \"Didn't knock and arsk for no one, though--not me. Twigged as it would be you, sir, on account of your sayin' to-night. I've read summink of the ways of 'tecs. Wot ho!\"  \"You seem a sharp little customer, at all events,\" said Cleek with a curious one-sided smile--a smile that was peculiar to him. \"I somehow fancy that I've made a good investment, Dollops. Filled up, eh?\"  \"No, sir--never filled. Born 'ungry, I reckon. But filled as much as you could fill me, bless your 'eart. I aren't never goin' to forget that, Gov'nor--no fear. An eater and a scrapper I am, sir; and I'll scrap for _you_, sir, while there's a bloomin' breff left in my blessed body! Gimme the tip wot kind of work I _can_ do for you, Gov'nor, will you? I want to get them two 'arf-crowns off my conscience as quick as I can.\"  Cleek looked at him and smiled again.  \"Yes, I'm _sure_ I made a good bargain, Dollops,\" he said. \"Come in.\" And in this way the attachment which existed between them ever afterward had its beginning.  He took the boy in and up to the little room on the second floor which he called his den; and, turning on the light, motioned him to a chair, laid aside his hat and gloves, and was just about to pull up a chair for himself when he caught sight of an unstamped letter lying upon his writing-table.  \"Sit down there and wait a moment until I read this, my lad,\" he said; and forthwith tore the letter open.  It was from Superintendent Narkom. He had known that from the first, however. No one but Narkom ever wrote him letters. This one was exceedingly brief. It simply contained these two lines:  \"My dear Cleek. The Three Jolly Fishermen, Richmond, at tea-time to-morrow. An astonishing affair. Yours, M. N.\"  \"Dollops, my lad, I think I'm going to make a man of you,\" he said as he tore the letter into a dozen pieces and tossed the fragments into a waste-basket. \"At any rate, I'm going to have a try. Know anything about Richmond?\"  \"Yuss, sir.\"  \"Good. Well, we'll have a half-hour's talk and then I'll find a temporary bed for you for the night, and to-morrow we'll take a pull on the river at Richmond and see what we shall see.\"  The half-hour, however, developed into a full one; for it was after two o'clock when the talk was finished and a bed improvised for the boy; but Cleek, saying good night to him at last and going to his own bedroom, felt that it was a long, long way from being time wasted.  What Dollops thought is, perhaps, best told"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14332"],["title","Cleek: the Man of the Forty Faces (#8)"],["body","the fact that he burst out crying when Cleek came in in the morning to ask how he had slept.  \"Slept, Gov'nor!\" he said. \"Why, bless your 'eart, sir, I couldn't a slept better on a bed of roses, nor 'ad 'arf such comfort. Feel like I needed someone to lend me a biff on the coco, sir, to make sure as I aren't a dreamin'--it's so wot a cove fancies 'Eaven to be like, sir.\"  And afterward, when the day was older, and they had gone to Richmond, and Cleek--in his boating flannels--was pulling him up the shining river and talking to him again as he had talked last night, he felt that it was even more like Heaven than ever.  It was after four--long after--when they finally separated and Cleek, leaving the boy in charge of the boat, stepped ashore in the neighbourhood of the inn of the Three Jolly Fishermen and went to keep his appointment with Narkom.  He found him enjoying tea at a little round table in the niche of a big bay window in the small private parlour which lay immediately behind the bar-room.  \"My dear chap, do forgive me for not waiting,\" said the superintendent contritely, as Cleek came in, looking like a college-bred athlete in his boating-flannels and his brim-tilted panama. \"But the fact is you are a little later than I anticipated; and I was simply famishing.\"  \"Share the blame of my lateness with me, Mr. Narkom,\" said Cleek as he tossed aside his hat and threw the fag-end of his cigarette through the open window. \"You merely said 'tea-time,' not any particular hour; and I improved the opportunity to take another spin up the river and to talk like a Dutch uncle to a certain young man whom I shall introduce to your notice in due time. It isn't often that duty calls me to a little Eden like this. The air is like balm to-day; and the river--oh, the river is a sheer delight.\"  Narkom rang for a fresh pot of tea and a further supply of buttered toast, and, when these were served, Cleek sat down and joined him.  \"I dare say,\" said the superintendent, opening fire at once, \"that you wonder what in the world induced me to bring you out here to meet me, my dear fellow, instead of following the usual course and calling at Clarges Street? Well, the fact is, Cleek, that the gentleman with whom I am now about to put you in touch lives in this vicinity, and is so placed that he cannot get away without running the risk of having the step he is taking discovered.\"  \"Humph! He is closely spied upon, then?\" commented Cleek. \"The trouble arises from someone or something in his own household?\"  \"No--in his father's. The 'trouble,' so far as I can gather, seems to emanate from his stepmother, a young and very beautiful woman, who was born on the island of Java, where the father of our client met and married her some two years ago, whither he had gone to probe into the truth of the amazing statement that a runic stone had been unearthed in that part of the globe.\"  \"Ah, then you need not tell me the gentleman's name, Mr. Narkom,\" interposed Cleek. \"I remember perfectly well the stir which that ridiculous and unfounded statement created at the time. Despite the fact that scholars of all nations scoffed at the thing, and pointed out that the very term 'rune' is of Teutonic origin, one enthusiastic old gentleman--Mr. Michael Bawdrey, a retired brewer, thirsting for something more enduring than malt to carry his name down the ages--became fired with enthusiasm upon the subject, and set forth for Java 'hot foot,' as one might say. I remember that the papers made great game of him; but I heard, I fancy, that, in spite of all, he was a dear, lovable old chap, and not at all like the creature the cartoonists portrayed him.\"  \"What a memory you have, my dear Cleek. Yes, that is the party; and he _is_ a dear, lovable old chap at bottom. Collects old china, old weapons, old armour, curiosities of all sorts--lots of 'em bogus, no doubt; catch the charlatans among the dealers letting a chance like that slip them--and is never so happy as when showing his 'collection' to his friends and being mistaken by the ignorant for a man of deep learning.\"  \"A very human trait, Mr. Narkom. We all are anxious that the world should set the highest possible valuation upon us. It is only when we are underrated that we object. So this dear, deluded old gentleman, having failed to secure a 'rune' in Java, brought back something equally cryptic--a woman? Was the lady of his choice a native or merely an inhabitant of the island?\"  \"Merely an inhabitant, my dear fellow. As a matter of fact, she is English. Her father, a doctor, long since deceased, took her out there in her childhood. She was none too well off, I believe; but that did not prevent her having many suitors, among whom was Mr. Bawdrey's own son, the gentleman who is anxious to have you take up this case.\"  \"Oho!\" said Cleek, with a strong, rising inflection. \"So the lady was of the careful and calculating kind? She didn't care for youth and all the rest of it when she could have papa and the money-chest without waiting. A common enough occurrence. Still, this does not make up an 'affair,' and especially an 'affair' which requires the assistance of a detective, and you spoke of 'a case.' What is the case, Mr. Narkom?\"  \"I will leave Mr. Philip Bawdrey himself to tell you that,\" said Narkom, as the door opened to admit a young man of about eight-and-twenty, clothed in tennis flannels, and looking very much perturbed, a handsome, fair-haired, fair-moustached young fellow, with frank, boyish eyes and that unmistakable something which stamps the products of the 'Varsities. \"Come in, Mr. Bawdrey. You said we were not to wait tea, and you see that we haven't. Let me have the pleasure of introducing Mr.--\"  \"Headland,\" put in Cleek adroitly, and with a look at Narkom as much as to say, \"Don't give me away. I may not care to take the case when I hear it, so what's the use of letting everybody know who I am?\" Then he switched round in his chair, rose, and held out his hand. \"Mr. George Headland, of the Yard, Mr. Bawdrey. I don't trust Mr. Narkom's proverbially tricky memory for names. He introduced me as Jones once, and I lost the opportunity of handling the case because the party in question couldn't believe that anybody named Jones would be likely to ferret it out.\"  \"Funny idea, that!\" commented young Bawdrey, smiling, and accepting the proffered hand. \"Rum lot of people you must run across in your line, Mr. Headland. Shouldn't take you for a detective myself, shouldn't even in a room full of them. College man, aren't you? Thought so. Oxon or Cantab?\"  \"Cantab--Emmanuel.\"  \"Oh, Lord! Never thought I'd ever live to appeal to an Emmanuel man to do anything brilliant. I'm an Oxon chap; Brasenose is my alma mater. I say, Mr. Narkom, do give me a cup of tea, will you? I had to slip off while the others were at theirs, and I've run all the way. Thanks very much. Don't mind if I sit in that corner and draw the curtain a little, do you?\" his frank, boyish face suddenly clouding. \"I don't want to be seen by anybody passing. It's a horrible thing to feel that you are being spied upon, at every turn, Mr. Headland, and that want of caution may mean the death of the person you love best in all the world.\"  \"Oh, it's that kind of case, is it?\" queried Cleek, making room for him to pass round the table and sit in the corner, with his back to the window and the loosened folds of the chintz curtain keeping him in the shadow.  \"Yes,\" answered young Bawdrey, with a half-repressed shudder and a deeper clouding of his rather pale face. \"Sometimes I try to make myself believe that it isn't, that it's all fancy, that she never could be so inhuman, and yet how else is it to be explained? You can't go behind the evidence; you can't make things different simply by saying that you will not believe.\" He stirred his tea nervously, gulped down a couple of mouthfuls of it, and then set the cup aside. \"I can't enjoy anything; it takes the savour out of everything when I think of it,\" he added, with a note of pathos in his voice. \"My dad, my dear, bully old dad, the best and dearest old boy in all the world! I suppose, Mr. Headland, that Mr. Narkom has told you something about the case?\"  \"A little--a very little indeed. I know that your father went to Java, and married a second wife there; and I know, too, that you yourself were rather taken with the lady at one time, and that she threw you over as soon as Mr. Bawdrey senior became a possibility.\"  \"That's a mistake,\" he replied. \"She never threw me over, Mr. Headland; she never had the chance. I found her out long before my father became anything like what you might call a rival, found her out as a mercenary, designing woman, and broke from her voluntarily. I only wish that I had known that he had one serious thought regarding her. I could have warned him; I could have spoken then. But I never did find out until it was too late. Trust her for that. She waited until I had gone up-country to look after some fine old porcelains and enamels that the governor had heard about; then she hurried him off and tricked him into a hasty marriage. Of course, after that I couldn't speak--I wouldn't speak. She was my father's wife, and he was so proud of her, so happy, dear old boy, that I'd have been little better than a brute to say anything against her.\"  \"What could you have said if you had spoken?\"  \"Oh, lots of things--the things that made me break away from her in the beginning. She'd had more love affairs than one; her late father's masquerading as a doctor for another. They had only used that as a cloak. They had run a gambling-house on the sly--he as the card-sharper, she as the decoy. They had drained one poor fellow dry, and she had thrown him over after leading him on to think that she cared for him and was going to marry him. He blew out his brains in front of her, poor wretch. They say she never turned a hair. You wouldn't believe it possible, if you saw her; she is so sweet"]]]
