But the crafty black dodged just in time, at the same instant throwing up his hands.  Harry gasped as he saw his unknown assailant deftly catch the rock fragment as though it had been a base ball.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\" jeered the black, in a hoarse, rumbling voice.  He threw back his hand, gathering impetus for the cast.  Hazelton could do nothing but throw himself on the defensive, planning to duplicate the black man's catch.  Then the stone came---but it did not go high, instead, by a jerk of his wrist, the negro hurled it at Harry's right foot.  That granite-like fragment struck Hazelton's foot with full force.  \"You---you scoundrel!\" groaned Harry, in an all but admiring gasp.  Like a flash he bent over, snatching up the fragment for his own use.  \"Now, I'll slam you into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico!\" cried the young engineer, vengefully, as he tried to straighten up.  A groan escaped him.  His injured foot was paining him more than he had expected.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\" harshly jeered this mysterious, evil creature.  The black man had halted as Harry prepared to throw, but he showed no sign of hesitation.  Though he stood still, he thrust his repulsive, leering face forward, as though to offer that face as the best mark.  Harry found that he could not stand straight---the pain in his injured foot was now too intense.  \"Get back with you!\" ordered Harry.  \"Get back if you don't want a heap worse than you gave me.\"  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\" came the sneering laugh.  Then the stranger reached out his hands as though to seize the youth.  \"I guess I'll have to do it---though not because I really want to hurt you!\" muttered Harry ruefully.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\"  There could be no question that the unknown was merely playing with him. Little as he liked to make the ugly throw Harry knew that he had to do it. When Hazelton had anything to do he believed in doing it well.  So, putting all possible force into his throw, Harry let the rock fragment fly, and this time he was sure that his enemy would not be able to dodge in time.  Nor did the black man make any seeming effort to dodge.  Bump!  Squarely in the black face the rock landed.  Harry heard the sound and felt ill within himself.  Yet the black man did not stagger.  With a contemptuous snort he kicked the fragment of rock into the water as it landed at his feet.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\"  For the first time Harry Hazelton felt positively dismayed.  He saw the long, massive arms moving, looking like a powerful ape's arms.  There could be no doubt that the unknown was ready for a spring.  Harry did not retreat.  Where could he run to?  Only a few yards could he go out towards the end of the wall.  Then, if he wished to continue his flight he could only take to the water.  Only a glance was needed at the bulky, powerful frame of the unknown to make it appear certain that the latter could swim two rods to the young engineer's one.  Harry decided instantly to stand his ground and to make the most valiant fight possible on so slippery a footing as that presented by the top of the retaining wall.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\"  It was as though the black unknown sought to terrify his intended victim with his repetitions of that harsh, discordant laugh.  Harry braced himself and waited.  Then, off shoreward, came the sound of \"put-put-put.\"  The motor boat, \"Morton,\" was putting out at last.  \"If I can keep this fellow busy for a few minutes, I can have all the help I want,\" flashed through Hazelton's mind.  So he opened his mouth, raising his voice in a long, pent-up hail.  \"R e---e---e a d e!  To---o---o---om  R e a d e!  Quick!  Hazelton!\"  \"Ha, ha!\" jeered the unknown black.  Then, suddenly, he leaped---not unexpectedly, however, for Harry had been watching, cat-like.  The unknown threw out his arms, seeking to wrap them around Hazelton.  Not in vain had Harry been trained, season after season, on the athletic ground of one of the best high school elevens in the United States.  As the fellow leaped at him Harry crouched lower and went straight at his opponent.  Powerful as the stranger was he was no football player.  Harry \"tackled\" him in the neatest possible way, then strove to rise with this great human being.  In the first instant it seemed to the young engineer as though he were trying to lift a mountain.  His back felt as though it were snapping under a giant's task.  Yet, but for one fact, Hazelton would have risen with his man, and would have hurled the mysterious one over into the waters of the gulf.  Just in the instant of victory Harry's injured right foot gave out under him.  With a stifled groan he sank down just as he threw his opponent.  The black, instead of going into the water, landed hard on his back on the top of the wall.  He was up again, however, before Hazelton could repress the pain in his foot and leap at the wretch.  \"Ha, ha!  Ho, ho!\" came the tantalizing challenge.  \"Put-put-put!\" sounded over the water, coming nearer all the time.  \"Re---e---e---e a d e!  T o m R e a d e!  Help---quick!\" yelled Harry, lustily.  This, doubtless, was the first call that Tom, at the bow of the motor boat, thought he heard.  Uttering a snort, this time, instead of the laugh, the black sprang at his intended prey.  Their heads met, with considerable force.  Then, with a wild chuckle, the black wound his apelike arms around the young engineer.  \"Reade!  Tom Reade!  Reade!\" bellowed Hazelton lustily, as he tried desperately to free himself from the crushing embrace of the other.  *     *     *     *     *  Over the waters came the penetrating beam of a small search-light.  The \"Morton\" was coming nearer all the time, but the ray did not yet reach with any great clearness the point where Harry Hazelton had been fighting for his life against his strange foe in the black night.  \"Keep parallel with the wall, Evarts,\" Tom ordered, crisply.  \"Conlon, are you pushing the engines for all it's worth?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came from the engine-tender.  \"This old craft isn't good for quite seven miles' an hour, anyway.\"  \"There!  Now I've picked up the part of the wall where there isn't any wall in sight just now,\" said Tom, wincing over his own bull.  \"Hazelton ought to be just this side of there.\"  \"There's no one near the breach,\" replied Evarts.  \"So I see,\" Reade admitted, in a tone of worriment.  \"Oh, well, Harry isn't such an infant as to be wiped out all in one moment.\"  \"Where is Mr. Hazelton then?\" inquired Evarts, as Tom swung the arc of the searchlight in broad curves.  \"Great Scott!  I wish I knew!\" gasped Reade, his perplexity and his anxiety growing with every second.  \"There appears to be no one on top of the wall.\"  Evarts ran in within a few feet of the wall, on the shore-side of the breach.  \"Shall I land you there, sir?\" questioned the foreman.  \"Presently,\" Tom nodded.  \"But now, back out a few feet and swing the boat's nose around so that I can make a search with this light.\"  Evarts obeyed the order.  Despite the smallness of the light, Reade was able to send the searching beam of light back nearly one-half of the way to shore. Nowhere was there any human being visible on the wall.  \"Harry!  Hazelton!\" bawled Tom, with all the power in his lungs.  There was no answer.  \"Jupiter!  You'll have to land me, I reckon,\" quaked Tom Reade.  \"Drive her nose in---gently.  I'll be ready to jump.\"  \"Be careful how you _do_ jump,\" warned Evarts.  \"It's mighty slippery on that wall tonight.\"  Tom poised himself as the boat moved in close.  Then he took a light leap, landing safely.  Here the young chief engineer again brought his pocket flash lamp into play.  Closely he scanned the top of the wall all around where he knew he had left his chum.  But Harry was nowhere to be seen, nor, on the wet wall, could Tom find any signs of a scuffle, or any other sign that gave him a clue.  \"Evarts, this is mighty mysterious!\" groaned the young chief.  \"Unless---\" hinted the foreman.  \"Unless what?\"  \"Perhaps Mr. Hazelton ran along the walltop to the shore.\"  \"He'd have hailed us, then, in passing, wouldn't he?\" choked Tom Reade. \"Besides, I had the light playing on this wall most of the way.  If he had run back we would have seen him, even if he hadn't hailed.  And he couldn't have run farther out to seaward.  Evarts, I'm downright worried.\"  Tom Reade might indeed well be worried over the grewsome mysteries of this night of evil deeds.     CHAPTER IV  SOME ONE CALLS AGAIN   Half an hour later Tom Reade leaped ashore at the little pier.  \"My orders, Mr. Reade.\"  \"They're brief and concise,\" Tom rejoined.  \"You're to cruise the length of the wall, especially farther out from shore.  Use your searchlight freely.  Keep the wall so guarded that no rascal can slip out there, either over the wall or by boat, and do any damage.  Mr. Evarts, the safety of the wall until daylight is your whole charge.\"  \"Very good, sir.  But I'm sure that nothing more will happen to the wall.\"  \"If anything does it will be up to you, Mr. Evarts,\" Tom assured him grimly.  \"I'll hold you responsible.\"  \"I won't let anything happen, Mr. Reade.  And I hope you find Mr. Hazelton all right.\"  \"He may be up at camp,\" Tom answered, though in his heart he did not believe it.  Had Harry escaped whatever danger had menaced him, Tom knew very well that his chum, after appealing for help, would by some means have signaled his subsequent safety.  However, Tom started toward camp at a run.  He was wholly mystified.  The search in the neighborhood of the breach in the wall had been continued until its hopelessness had been fully demonstrated.  The search had also been continued over the water, for a possible clue to the mystery.  Though Tom ran, he felt himself choking, stifling.  Despite all his efforts to cheer himself the young chief engineer felt certain that his chum had mysteriously met his fate, and that brave, dependable Harry Hazelton"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14369"],["title","The Young Engineers on the Gulf (#5)"],["body","no more.  Yet how could he have vanished so completely, and what possibly could have happened to his assailant or assailants?  \"It'll be an awful night, until daylight,\" Tom groaned inwardly, as he ran.  \"At daylight, of course, we can make a far better search, especially over the water.  But in the hours that must elapse---!  It's going to be a tough period of waiting!\"  Arrived at camp, Tom made straight for his own barracks, letting himself in with a latch-key as soon as he could control his shaking hand sufficiently to use the key.  Tom bounded straight for the bed-room of the superintendent, at the rear of the little building.  \"Mr. Renshaw!\" shouted the young chief, throwing open the bed-room door.  The barrack was lighted by electricity.  Tom threw on the light, then wheeled toward the bed, to find the superintendent sitting up, revolver in hand.  \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" gasped the superintendent.  \"Mr. Reade, in my stupor from being aroused I was just on the point of shooting you for a burglar.  It's awful!\"  \"You ought to throw that revolver to the bottom of the gulf,\" Tom rasped out.  \"Not much!\" retorted the superintendent.  \"Handling as mixed a crew as we have on this work I wouldn't think of going about unarmed.  And you ought to go armed, too, Mr. Reade.\"  \"Bosh!\" uttered Tom.  He had a well-known objection to carrying a pistol. Reade always maintained that a pistol-carrying man was a coward.  A coward is one who is afraid, and the man who is not afraid has no reason to carry a weapon.  \"Renshaw,\" added Tom, \"there's just one circumstance in which I would carry a pistol---and that is, if I were carrying large sums of other people's money.  If I were a pay-master, or a bank messenger, I'd carry a pistol, but under no other circumstances, outside of military service, would I carry a weapon.  But---are you thoroughly awake, now?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then, Mr. Renshaw, get up and hide that pistol somewhere.  While you're about it, listen to me.  Some scoundrel has blown out a large portion of our retaining wall to-night.  I left Hazelton on guard at the point and came ashore to get out the motor boat, 'Morton.'  Before I could return I heard Hazelton's call for help, and---he has disappeared!  There's wicked work on hand to-night.  You'll have to get up and help me.  Be quick with your dressing.  We've work to do to-night, and all of it is man's work.\"  Tom hastily added such other particulars as were needed.  Renshaw, while he dressed hurriedly, listened with a horror that he took no pains to conceal.  \"Evarts claims that it's revenge work, on the part of some of our men, because Hazelton and I stopped gambling in the camp,\" Tom continued.  \"It might be,\" Renshaw admitted thoughtfully.  \"But to me it seems that there must be a lot more behind the whole terrible matter.\"  \"That's the way it strikes me, too,\" Tom nodded.  \"However, you're dressed, so now we can hurry out and get busy.\"  \"What shall we do first?\" Superintendent Renshaw inquired.  \"That's what I've been thinking over while you were dressing,\" Tom replied. \"Of course the one thing of real importance is to find Hazelton.\"  \"Killed, beyond a doubt,\" replied the older man.  \"I refuse to believe it,\" Tom retorted.  \"There's a mystery in his fate, but I simply won't believe that Harry has been killed.\"  \"Then why didn't you hear from him further?\"  \"That's the mystery.\"  Tom had shaped their course for the barracks occupied by the foremen.  He bounded upon the little porch and began to hammer on the door with both fists.  \"Turn out, everybody!\" Tom bellowed.  \"Every foreman is on duty to-night. Show a light, and let us in as soon as you can.\"  Some one was heard stirring.  Then Dill, one of the foremen, admitted the callers.  \"Are all the others up?\" Reade asked, sharply.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Good!  Tell your associates to finish dressing as quickly as possible and to meet me in the office.\"  \"The office\" was a little room just inside the entrance to the building. It was a room where the foremen sat and chatted in the evenings.  \"Put a double-hustle on, everyone,\" Tom called after Dill.  \"Yes, sir.\"  Barely three minutes had passed when all of the six remaining foremen had assembled.  Tom plunged instantly into a brief account of what had happened.  \"It seems to me, sir---\" Dill began.  \"Keep it to yourself, then, if you please,\" Tom interrupted him gently. \"We haven't any time for opinions to-night.  What we want is swift, intelligent work, and a lot of it.\"  Tom thereupon gave each man his directions.  \"Now, each of you go to your own gangs in the camp,\" he added.  \"Wake what men you need and put 'em to work.  If any of the men object to being taken from their cots in the night, just lift them out.  Don't stand any nonsense.  Let each foreman make it his business to know just what the men under him are doing.\"  One foreman was to take men with lanterns and go out carefully over every foot of the seawall.  Another was to organize a beach patrol.  Still another, with but two men, was to go into the town of Blixton and see if any tidings of Hazelton could be obtained there.  To one foreman fell the task of searching carefully through camp before going to other work assigned to him.  \"Now, get to work, all of you,\" Tom ordered.  \"As an extra inducement you can tell your men that the one who finds Hazelton, whether dead or alive, shall have a reward of one hundred dollars.  Remember the watchword for to-night, which is, 'hustle!'\"  In all, some sixty men were pulled from their cots.  Tom, having given the orders, walked down to the beach with his superintendent.  \"You've covered everything that's possible, I think, Mr. Reade,\" commented the foreman.  \"I think I have.  But there won't be any rest for any one until we have found Hazelton.\"  \"Are you going to have the water dragged?\"  \"Not before daylight---perhaps not then,\" Reade replied.  \"I can't bring myself to believe that Harry was thrown into the water and that he drowned there.\"  \"It'll take the chief a day or two to realize that,\" sighed the superintendent to himself.  \"Yet that is exactly what has happened.  The chief won't believe it, though, until the body is found.\"  Down on the beach there was really nothing for Tom and his head man to do after the arrival of the foremen and their gangs.  Everything went ahead in an orderly manner.  \"I don't suppose you could get any rest, under the circumstances, Mr. Reade,\" hinted the superintendent, \"yet that is just what you are going to need.\"  \"Rest?\" echoed Tom, gazing at the man, in a strange, wide-eyed way, while a grim smile flickered around the corners of his mouth.  \"What have rest and I to do with each other just now?\"  \"Yet there's nothing you can do here.\"  \"I am here, anyway,\" Reade retorted.  \"I'm on the spot---that's something.\"  \"Let me run back to the house and get you some blankets,\" urged the superintendent.  \"Then you can lie down on the sand and rest.  Of course I know you can't sleep at present.\"  \"It is not necessary go back,\" volunteered a voice behind them.  \"I have the blankets.\"  \"Nicolas!\" gasped Tom, in surprise.  \"How did you know I was here?\"  \"I wake up when you talk to Meester Renshaw,\" replied the Mexican simply. \"I listen.  I know, now---poor Senor Hazelton!\"  Nicolas's voice broke, and, as he stepped closer, Tom beheld some large tears trickling down the little Mexican's face.  \"Nicolas, you're a good fellow!\" cried Tom, impulsively, \"but I don't want the blankets.  Spread them on the sand, then lie down on them yourself until I need you.\"  \"What---me?  I lie down?\" demanded Nicolas.  \"No, no!  That impossible is. I must walk, walk!  Me?  I am like the caged panther to-night.  I want nothing but find the enemy who have hurt Senor Hazelton.  Then I jump on the back of that enemy!\"  Saying which Nicolas saluted, and, as became his position of servant, fell back some yards.  But first he had dropped the blankets to the beach.  The light of lanterns showed that the men of one gang were searching thoroughly all along the top of the wall.  Once in a while a man belonging to the beach patrol passed the chief engineer and the superintendent, reporting only that no signs of Harry had been found.  An hour thus passed.  Then, from over the water, as the lantern-bearing searchers were returning, a dull explosion boomed across the water.  \"Great Scott!\" quivered Tom.  \"There they go at it again, Mr. Renshaw! Another section of the retaining wall has gone---blown up!\"     CHAPTER V  WANTED---DAYLIGHT AND DIVERS   In a trice the foreman of the gang on the wall wheeled his men about, running them out seaward toward the scene of the latest explosion.  That much was plain from the twinkling of the rapidly-moving lanterns.  \"Come on, Renshaw!\" Tom shouted.  \"You, too, Nicolas.  You can pull an oar.\"  Reade was already racing out on to the small dock.  He all but threw himself into a rowboat that lay tied alongside.  \"Cast off and get in,\" Tom ordered his companions, as he pushed out a pair of oars.  \"Nicolas, you're also good with a pair of oars.  Mr. Renshaw, you take the tiller.  Inform me instantly when you see the first gleam of the 'Morton's' search-light.  Evarts ought to have caught the scoundrels this time.  Evidently he's been cruising softly without showing a light.\"  Mr. Renshaw gathered up the tiller ropes as Tom pushed off from the dock. Then the chief engineer addressed himself to the task of rowing.  His firm muscles, working at their best, shot the little craft ahead.  Nicolas, at the bow oars, did his best to keep up with his chief in the matter of rowing, though the Mexican was neither an oarsman nor an athlete.  \"Don't you make out the motor boat's lights yet?\" Tom asked impatiently, after the first long spurt of rowing.  \"Not yet, sir,\" replied the superintendent.  \"I shan't miss the light when it shows.\"  A few minutes later the superintendent announced in a low voice:  \"There's some craft, motionless, just a bit"]]]
