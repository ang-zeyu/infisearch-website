These men came \"suddenly, from behind, knocked him down with      a mace, and partially shackled him.\" He struggled hard      against the five, shook them off, and with the handcuff,      which had been secured to his right wrist only \"inflicted      some hard wounds on the countenances\" of his assailants.      Covered with blood, he broke from them, rushed from the      house, and plunged in the river close by, exclaiming, \"I will      be drowned rather than taken alive.\" He was pursued, fired      upon repeatedly, ordered to come out of the water, where he      stood immersed to his neck, or \"they would blow his brains      out.\" He replied, \"I will die first.\" They then deliberately      fired at him four or five different times, the last ball      supposed to have struck on his head, for his face was      instantly covered with blood, and he sprang up and shrieked.      The by-standers began to cry \"shame\" and the kidnappers      retired a short distance for consultation. Bill came out of      the water and lay down on the shore. His pursuers, supposing      him dying, said, \"Dead niggers are not worth taking South.\"      Some one brought and put on him a pair of pantaloons. He was      helped to his feet by a colored man named Rex; on seeing      which, Wynkoop and party headed him and presented their      revolvers, when BILL again ran into the river, \"where he      remained upwards of an hour, nothing but his head above      water, covered with blood, and in full view of hundreds who      lined the banks.\" His claimants dared not follow him into      the water; for, as he said afterward, \"he would have died      contented, could he have carried two or three of them down      with him.\" Preparations [rather slow it would appear,] were      made to arrest the murderous gang, but they had departed      from the place. BILL then waded some distance up the stream,      and \"was found by some women flat on his face in a      corn-field. They carried him to a place of safety, dressed      his wounds,\" and the suffering man was seen no more in      Wilkesbarre.--_Correspondence of New York Tribune_.  Wynkoop and another were afterwards arrested in Philadelphia, on a charge of riot, the warrant issuing from a State magistrate of Wilkesbarre, on the complaint of William C. Gildersleeve, of the place. Mr. Jackson, the constable who held them in custody, was brought before Judge Grier, of the United States Supreme Court, by _habeas corpus_. Judge Grier, during the examination, said:--       \"I will not have the officers of the United States harassed      at every step in the performance of their duties by every      petty magistrate who chooses to harass them, or by any      unprincipled interloper who chooses to make complaints      against them--for I know something of the man who makes this      complaint.\" \"If this man Gildersleeve fails to make out the      facts set forth in the warrant of arrest, I will request the      Prosecuting Attorney of Luzerne County to prosecute him      for  perjury. * * * If any tuppenny magistrate, or any      unprincipled interloper can come in, and cause to be arrested      the officers of the United States, whenever they please, it      is a sad affair. * * * If _habeas corpuses_ are to be taken      out alter that manner, I will have an indictment sent to the      United States Grand Jury against the person who applies for      the writ, or assists in getting it, the lawyer who defends      it, and the sheriff who serves the writ. * * * I will see      that my officers are protected.\" On a subsequent day, Judge      Grier gave an elaborate opinion, reciting the facts in the      case, _as stated by the prisoners_, and ordering them to be      _discharged_! He said:--\"We are unable to perceive, in this      transaction, anything worthy of blame in the conduct of these      officers in their unsuccessful endeavors to fulfil a most      dangerous and disgusting duty; except, perhaps, a want of      sufficient courage and perseverance in the attempt to execute      the writ!\"  Wynkoop and the other were discharged by Judge Kane on the ground that they did only what their duty, under the Law, required. (May, 1854.)       _A family of colored persons_, at Uniontown, Pa., were      claimed as slaves by a man in Virginia. They admitted that      they had been his slaves, but declared that they had come      into Pennsylvania with their master's consent and knowledge,      on a visit to some friends in Fayette County, and were not,      therefore, _fugitives_. This was overruled, and the negroes      were sent back by a United States Commissioner, name not      given. (September, 1853.)[A]--_Pittsburgh Saturday Visiter_.       [Footnote A: _A correspondent_ of the _New York Evening      Post_, writing from Columbus, Ohio, September 1, 1853, states      that a very large number of fugitive slaves are continually      passing through that State; that they are generally armed;      and that they find increasing sympathy among the people on      the road, and the boatmen on the lakes.]       _A desperate fight_ between a party of four fugitives and      about double the number of whites, took place in Carroll      County, Maryland. Four white men shot--none dangerously. Two      of the slaves wounded, one severely. They were captured.      (October, 1853.)--_Westminster (Md.) Democrat_.       _Washington, Indiana._ In April, 1853, GEORGE, a negro man,      was arrested and claimed by a Mr. Rice, of Kentucky, as his      slave. Judge Clemens ordered his surrender to Rice, who took      him to Louisville, and there sold him to a slave-trader, who      took him to Memphis, Tennessee. Here a man from Mississippi      claimed that George was _his_ slave, obtained a writ of      replevin, and took possession of him.       JOSHUA GLOVER, colored man, claimed as the slave of B.S.      Garland, of St. Louis County, Missouri, was arrested near      Racine, Wisconsin, about the 10th of March, 1854. Arrest made      by five men, who burst suddenly into his shanty, put a pistol      to his head, felled him to the ground, handcuffed him, and      took him in a wagon to Milwaukee jail, a distance of      twenty-five miles. They swore that if he shouted or made the      least noise, they would kill him instantly. When visited,      says the _Milwaukee Sentinel_, \"We found him in his cell. He      was cut in two places on the head; the front of his shirt and      vest were soaking and stiff with his own blood.\" A writ of      _habeas corpus_ was immediately issued; also a warrant for      the arrest of the five men who assaulted and beat him in his      shanty. Thousands of people collected around the jail and      court-house, \"the excitement being intense.\" A vigilance      committee of twenty-five persons was appointed to watch the      jail at night and see that Glover was not secretly taken      away. The next day, at about five o'clock, P.M., a      considerable accession of persons being made to the crowd,      and it appearing that every attempt to save Glover by the      laws of Wisconsin had been overruled by United States Judge      Miller, a demand was made for the man. This being refused, an      attack was made upon the door with axes, planks, &c. It was      broken in, the inner door and wall broken through, and Glover      taken from his keepers, brought out, placed in a wagon, and      driven off at great speed.       S.M. Booth, editor of the _Milwaukee Free Democrat_, Charles      Clement, of the _Racine Advocate_, W.H. Waterman, and George      S. Wright were arrested for aiding and abetting the rescue of      Glover. Booth was subsequently discharged by the Supreme      Court of Wisconsin, on the ground that the Fugitive Slave Law      is unconstitutional. He was, however, re-arrested, and held      to answer in the United States Courts, on the same charge;      the offered bail was refused, and he was lodged in jail. The      case was subsequently tried before the District Court of the      United States, at Milwaukee, on the question as to the right      of a State judiciary to release prisoners under a writ of      _habeas corpus_, who may be in the lawful custody of United      States officers; and also to determine the constitutionality      of the Fugitive Slave Law. (_Washington Star_, September 20,      1854.) The Attorney General, Caleb Cushing, made himself very      active in pushing forward this case. Mr. Booth, early in      1855, was fined one thousand dollars and sentenced to one      month's imprisonment. John Ryecraft, for same offence, was      sentenced in a fine of two hundred dollars and imprisonment      for ten days. All for acts such as Christianity and Humanity      enjoin. On a writ of _habeas corpus_, Messrs. Booth and      Ryecraft were taken before the Wisconsin Supreme Court,      sitting at Madison, and discharged from imprisonment. This,      however, did not relieve them from the fines imposed by the      United States Court. The owner of the slave brought a civil      suit against Mr. Booth, claiming $1,000 damages for the loss      of his slave. Judge Miller decided, July, 1855, that the      $1,000 must be paid.       EDWARD DAVIS, _March, 1854_. As the steamboat Keystone State,      Captain Hardie, from Savannah, was entering Delaware Bay,      bound to Philadelphia, the men engaged in heaving the lead      heard a voice from under the guards of the boat, calling for      help. A rope was thrown, and a man caught it and was drawn      into the boat in a greatly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13990"],["title","The Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims (#7)"],["body","state. He had remained      in that place from the time of leaving Savannah, the water      frequently sweeping over him. Some bread in his pocket was      saturated with salt water and dissolved to a pulp. The      captain ordered the vessel to be put in to Newcastle,      Delaware, where the fugitive, hardly able to stand, was taken      on shore and put in jail, to await the orders of his owner,      in Savannah. DAVIS claimed to be a free man, and a native of      Philadelphia, and described many localities there. Before      Judge Bradford, at Newcastle, Davis's freedom was fully      proved, and he was discharged. He was again arrested and      placed in jail on the oath of Captain Hardie, that he      believed him to be a fugitive slave and a fugitive from      justice. After some weeks' delay, he was brought to trial      before United States Commissioner Samuel Guthrie, who ordered      him to be delivered up to his claimant on the ground that he      was legally a slave, though free-born. It appeared in      evidence that Davis had formerly gone from Pennsylvania to      reside in Maryland, contrary to the laws of that State; which      forbid free colored persons from other States to come there      to reside; and being unable to pay the fine imposed for this      offence (!) by the Orphan's (!) Court of Harford County, was      committed to jail and sold as a slave for life, by Robert      McGaw, Sheriff of the County, to Dr. John G. Archer, of      Louisiana, from whom he was sold to B.M. Campbell, who sold      him to William A. Dean, of Macon, Georgia, the present      claimant. Thus a free-born citizen of Pennsylvania was      consigned, _by law_ to slavery for life:  [-->In May, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was enacted.]       ANTHONY BURNS, arrested in Boston, May 24, 1854, as the slave      of Charles F. Suttle, of Alexandria, Virginia, who was      present to claim him, accompanied by a witness from Richmond,      Virginia, named William Brent. Burns was arrested on a      warrant granted by United States Commissioner Edward Greeley      Loring, taken to the court-house in Boston, ironed, and      placed in an upper story room under a strong guard. The      hearing commenced the next morning before Mr. Loring, but was      adjourned until Saturday; May 27, to give the counsel for A.      Burns time to examine the case. On Friday evening, (26th,) an      attack was made upon the court-house by a body of men, with      the evident design of rescuing Burns; a door was forced in,      and one of the marshal's special guard, (named Batchelder,)      was killed, whether by the assailants or by one of his own      party is uncertain, it being quite dark; upon the cry of      Batchelder that he was killed, the attacking party retreated      and made no further attempt. The trial of the case proceeded      on Saturday, again on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, when      the Commissioner said he would give his decision on Friday.      During the trial, Burns was continually surrounded by a      numerous body-guard, (said to be at least one hundred and      twenty-five men,) selected by Watson Freeman, United States      Marshal, from the vilest sinks of scoundrelism, corruption,      and crime in the city to be Deputy Marshals for the occasion.      These men, with every form of loathsome impurity and      hardened villainy stamped upon their faces, sat constantly      around the prisoner while in the court-room, the handles of      pistols and revolvers visibly protruding from their breast      pockets. A company of United States troops, from the Navy      Yard, occupied the court-house, and guarded all avenues to      the United States court-room. The testimony of numerous      highly respectable witnesses was adduced to show that Anthony      Burns was in Boston a month earlier than the time at which he      was said to have left Richmond. R.H. Dana, Jr. and Charles M.      Ellis, counsel for Burns, made very eloquent and able      arguments in his behalf. Seth J. Thomas and E.G. Parker were      the counsel for Suttle, the case being constantly watched and      aided by the United States District Attorney, Benjamin F.      Hallett, who was in regular telegraphic communication with      the President of the United States, (F. Pierce,) at      Washington. An effort was made, and followed up with much      patience, to buy Burns's freedom, Suttle having offered to      sell him for $1,200. The money was raised and tendered to      Suttle, when difficulties were interposed, especially by Mr.      Attorney Hallett, and the attempt failed. Suttle afterwards      declared he would not sell Burns for any sum, but that he      should go back to Virginia. On Friday morning, June 2d,      Commissioner Loring gave his decision, overriding all the      testimony in Burns's favor, using certain expressions which      fell from Burns in the first heat and confusion of his      arrest, as testimony against him, and concluding with      ordering him to be delivered up to the claimant. Some four      hours were consumed in getting Court Street, State Street,      &c., in a state of readiness for the removal of the prisoner.      A regiment of Massachusetts Infantry had been posted on      Boston Common, under command of Col. Benjamin Franklin (!)      Edmands, from an early hour of the day, in anticipation of      the Commissioner's decision. These troops, which had been      called out by the Mayor, Jerome V.C. Smith, were marched to      the scene of the kidnapping, and so placed as to guard every      street, lane, and other avenue leading to State Street, &c.,      the route through which the slave procession was to pass. No      individual was suffered to pass within these guards; but acts      of violence were committed by them on several individuals.      Court Square was occupied by two companies of United States      troops, (chiefly Irishmen,) and a large field-piece was drawn      into the centre. All preparations being made, Watson Freeman      (United States Marshal) issued forth from the court-house      with his prisoner, who walked with a firm step, surrounded by      the body-guard of criminals before mentioned, with drawn      United States sabres in their hands, and followed by United      States troops with the aforesaid piece of artillery. Preceded      by a company of Massachusetts mounted troops, under command      of Colonel Isaac H. Wright, this infamous procession took its      way down Court Street, State Street and Commerce Street, (for      the proprietors of Long Wharf refused to allow them to march      upon their premises, through a public highway in all ordinary      cases,) to the T Wharf, where the prisoner was taken on board      a steam tow-boat, and conveyed down the harbor to the United      States Revenue Cutter Morris; in which he was transported to      Virginia.       It may not be amiss to have given, in a single instance, this      somewhat detailed account of the process of seizing, trying,      and delivering up a man into slavery, whose only crime was      that he had fled from a bondage \"one hour of which is fraught      with more misery than ages of that which our fathers rose in      rebellion to throw off,\" Thomas Jefferson, the Virginian      slaveholder, himself being witness.       Anthony Burns, having been sold into North Carolina, was      afterwards purchased with money subscribed in Boston and      vicinity, for the purpose, and returned to Boston.       The _illegality_ of the Mayor's conduct in ordering out the      military, and giving to the Colonel of the regiment the      entire control of the same, was fully shown by different and      highly competent writers, among whom was P.W. Chandler, Esq.,      whose two articles, in the _Boston Advertiser_, deserve to be      remembered with respect. The Mayor's excuse was that he      desired to _keep the peace_. But these Massachusetts troops      received pay for their day's work from the United States      Government. Judge HOAR, in a charge to the Grand Jury,      declared the act of the Mayor, in calling out the militia, to      be an infraction of law.        STEPHEN PEMBROKE, and his two sons, _Robert_ and _Jacob_,      19 and 17 years of age, were arrested in New York almost      simultaneously with the seizure of Burns in Boston; claimed      as the slaves of David Smith and Jacob H. Grove, of      Sharpsburg, Washington County, Maryland. They escaped May      1st, and came to New York, followed closely by their masters,      who discovered their retreat in Thompson Street, and pounced      upon them by night. At 8-1/2 o'clock, next morning, they were      taken before United States Commissioner G.W. Morton, \"where      the case came up for the most summary and hasty hearing that      has ever characterized our judicial proceedings.\" Dunning and      Smith were counsel for the masters, but the fugitives had no      counsel; and the hearing was finished, and a warrant granted      to the slave claimants before the matter became known in the      city. When Mr. Jay and Mr. Culver hastened to the court-room      to offer their services to the prisoners, as counsel, they      were assured by officers, _and by Commissioner Morton      himself_, that the men wanted no counsel, and were not in the      building. On search, however, it was found they were in the      building, locked up in a room. They said they desired counsel      and the aid of friends. A writ of _habeas corpus_ was      obtained, but before it could be served the three men had      been removed from the State, and were on their way to      Baltimore. [See the published.
