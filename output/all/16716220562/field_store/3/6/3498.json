I didn't want to bother anybody, but Glory seemed to think this was where the trail ended.\"  Miss Satterly laughed again.  \"It certainly was funny--you trying to get him away, and being so still about it.  I _heard_ you whispering swear-words, and I wanted to scream!  I just couldn't keep still any longer.  Is he balky?\"  \"I don't know what he is--now,\" said Weary plaintively.  \"He was, at that time.  He's generally what happens to be the most dev--mean under the circumstances.\"  \"Well, maybe he'll consent to being led to the stable; he looks as if he had a most unmerciful master!\"  (Weary, being perfectly innocent, blushed guiltily)  \"But I'll forgive you riding him like that, and make for you a pitcher of lemonade and give you some cake while he rests. You certainly must not ride back with him so tired.\"  Fresh lemonade sounded tempting, after that ride.  And being lectured was not at all what he had expected from the schoolma'am--and who can fathom the mind of a man?  Weary gave her one complex glance, laid his hand upon the bridle and discovered that Glory, having done what mischief he could, was disposed to be very meek.  At the corral gate Weary looked back.  \"At dances,\" he mused aloud, \"one doesn't consider men as individuals--it's merely a question of feet.  She took me for a train robber; and I danced with her about forty times, that night, and took her over to supper and we whacked up on our chicken salad because there was only one dish for the two of us--oh, mamma!\"  He pulled off the saddle with a preoccupied air and rubbed Glory down mechanically.  After that he went over and sat down on the oats' box and smoked two cigarettes while he pondered many things.  He stood up and thoughtfully surveyed himself, brushed sundry bright sorrel hairs from his coat sleeves, stooped and tried to pinch creases into the knees of his trousers, which showed symptoms of \"bagging.\"  He took off his hat and polished it with his sleeve he had just brushed so carefully, pinched four big dimples in the crown, turned it around three times for critical inspection, placed it upon his head at a studiously unstudied angle, felt anxiously at his neck-gear and slapped Glory affectionately upon the rump--and came near getting kicked into eternity.  Then he swung off up the path, softly whistling \"In the good, old summer-time.\"  An old hen, hovering her chicks in the shade of the hay-rack, eyed him distrustfully and cried \"k-r-_r-r-r_\" in a shocked tone that sent her chickens burrowing deeper under her feathers.  Miss Satterly had changed her pink kimono for a white shirt-waist and had fluffed her hair into a smooth coil on the top of her head.  Weary thought she looked very nice.  She could make excellent lemonade, he discovered, and she proved herself altogether different from what the messages she sent him had led him to expect.  Weary wondered, until he became too interested to think about it.  Presently, without quite knowing how it came about, he was telling her all about the race.  Miss Satterly helped him reckon his winnings--which was not easy to do, since he had been offered all sorts of odds and had accepted them all with a recklessness that was appalling.  While her dark head was bent above the piece of paper, and her pencil was setting down figures with precise little jabs, he watched her.  He quite forgot the messages he had received from her through the medium of the Happy Family, and he quite forgot that women could hurt a man.  \"Mr. Davidson,\" she announced severely, when the figures had all been dabbed upon the paper, \"You ought to have lost.  It would be a lesson to you.  I haven't quite figured all your winnings, these six-to-ones and ten-to-ones and--and all that, take time to unravel.  But you, yourself, stood to lose just three hundred and sixty-five dollars. Gee! but you cowboys are reckless.\"  There was more that she said, but Weary did not mind.  He had discovered that he liked to look at the schoolma'am.  After that, nothing else was of much importance.  He began to wish he might prolong his opportunity for looking.  \"Say,\" he said suddenly, \"Come on and let's go to the dance.\"  The schoolma'am bit at her pencil and looked at him.  \"It's late--\"  \"Oh, there's time enough,\" urged Weary.  \"Maybe--but--\"  \"Do yuh think we aren't well enough acquainted?\"  \"Well we're not exactly old friends,\" she laughed.  \"We're going to be, so it's all the same,\" Weary surprised himself by declaring with much emphasis.  \"You'd go, wouldn't you, if I was--well, say your brother?\"  Miss Satterly rested her chin in her palms and regarded him measuringly.  \"I don't know.  I never had one--except three or four that I--er--adopted, at one time or another.  I suppose one could go, though--with a brother.\"  Weary made a rapid, mental note for the benefit of the Happy Family--and particularly Cal Emmett.  \"Darling Brother\" was a myth, then; he ought to have known it, all along.  And if that were a myth, so probably were all those messages and things that he had hated.  She didn't care anything about him--and suddenly that struck him unpleasantly, instead of being a relief, as it consistently should have been.  \"I wish you'd adopt me, just for to-night, and go;\" he said, and his eyes backed the wish.  \"You see,\" he added artfully, \"it's a sin to waste all that good music--a real, honest-to-God stringed orchestra from Great Falls, and--\"  \"Meekers have taken both rigs,\" objected she, weakly.  \"I noticed a side saddle hanging in the stable,\" he wheedled, \"and I'll gamble I can rustle something to put it on.  I--\"  \"I should think you'd gambled enough for one day,\" she quelled.  \"But that chunky little gray in the pasture is the horse I always ride.  I expect,\" she sighed, \"my new dancing dress would be a sight to behold when I got there--and it won't wash.  But what does a mere man care--\"  \"Wrap it up in something, and I'll carry it for yuh,\" Weary advised eagerly.  \"You can change at the hotel.  It's dead easy.\"  He picked up his hat from the floor, rose and stood looking anxiously down at her. \"About how soon,\" he insinuated, \"can you be ready?\"  The schoolma'am looked up at him irresolutely, drew a long breath and then laughed.  \"Oh, ten minutes will do,\" she surrendered.  \"I shall put my new dress in a box, and go just as I am.  Do you _always_ get your own way, Mr. Davidson?\"  \"Always,\" he lied convincingly over his shoulder, and jumped off the porch without bothering to use the steps.  She was waiting when he led the little gray up to the house, and she came down the steps with a large, flat, pasteboard box in her arms.  \"Don't get off,\" she commanded.  \"I can mount alone--and you'll have to carry the box.  It's going to be awkward, but you _would_ have me go.\"  Weary took the box and prudently remained in the saddle.  Glory, having the man he did for master, was unused to the flutter of women's skirts so close, and rolled his eyes till the whites showed all round. Moreover, he was not satisfied with that big, white thing in Weary's arms.  He stood quite still, however, until the schoolma'am was settled to her liking in the saddle, and had tucked her skirt down over the toe of her right foot.  He watched the proceeding with much interest--as did Weary--and then walked sedately from the yard, through the pebbly creek and up the slope beyond.  He heard Weary give a sigh of relief at his docility, and straightway thrust his nose between his white front feet, and proceeded to carry out certain little plans of his own.  Weary, taken by surprise and encumbered by the box, could not argue the point; he could only, in range parlance, \"hang and rattle.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Miss Satterly, \"if he's going to act like that, give me the box.\"  Weary would like to have done so, but already he was half way to the gate, and his coat was standing straight out behind to prove the speed of his flight.  He could not even look back.  He just hung tight to the box and rode.  The little gray was no racer, but his wind was good; and with urging he kept the fleeing Glory in sight for a mile or so.  Then, horse and rider were briefly silhouetted against the sunset as they topped a distant hill, and after that the schoolma'am rode by faith.  At the gate which led into the big Flying U field she overtook them. Glory, placid as a sheep, was nibbling a frayed end of the rope which held the gate shut, and Weary, the big box balanced in front of him across the saddle, was smoking a cigarette.  \"Well,\" greeted Miss Satterly breathlessly, and rather tartly, \"only for you having my dress, I'd have gone straight back home.  Do brothers always act like this?\"  \"Search me,\" said Weary, shaking his head.  \"Anyway, yuh better talk to Glory about it.  He appears to be running this show.  When I rode out to your place, I didn't have any bit in his mouth at all.  Coming back, I've got one of Joe Meeker's teething rings, that wouldn't hold a pet turkey.  But we're going to the dance, Miss Satterly.  Don't you worry none about that.\"  Miss Satterly laughed and rode ahead of them.  \"I'm going,\" she announced firmly.  \"It's leap year, and I think I can rustle a partner if you decide to sit and look through that gate all night.\"  \"You'll need your pretty dress.  Glory ain't much used to escorting young ladies, but he's a gentleman; we're coming, all right.\"  It was strange, perhaps, that Glory should miss the chance of proving his master a liar, but he nevertheless ambled decorously to Dry Lake and did nothing more unseemly than nipping occasionally at the neck of the little gray.  That is how Weary learned that large, brown eyes do not look sidelong at a man after the manner of long, heavy-lidded blue ones; and that, also, is how he came to throw up his head and deny to himself and his world that he ever was shy of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14542"],["title","The Lonesome Trail and Other Stories (#3)"],["body","n.     PART TWO  Weary rode stealthily around the corner of the little, frame school-house and was not disappointed.  The schoolma'am was sitting unconventionally upon the doorstep, her shoulder turned to him and her face turned to the trail by which a man naturally would be supposed to approach the place.  Her hair was shining darkly in the sun and the shorter locks were blowing about her face in a downright tantalizing fashion; they made a man want to brush them back and kiss the spot they were caressing so wantonly.  She was humming a tune softly to herself. Weary caught the words, sung absently, under her breath:    \"Didn't make no blunder--yuh couldn't confuse him.   A perfect wonder, yuh had to choose him!\"  The schoolma'am was addicted to coon songs of the period.  She seemed to be very busy about something and Weary, craning his neck to see over her shoulder, wondered what.  Also, he wished he knew what she was thinking about, and he hoped her thoughts were not remote from himself.  Just then Glory showed unmistakable and malicious intentions of sneezing, and Weary, catching a glimpse of something in Miss Satterly's hand, hastened to make his presence known.  \"I hope yuh aren't limbering up that weapon of destruction on my account, Schoolma'am,\" he observed mildly.  The schoolma'am jumped and slid something out of sight under her ruffled, white apron.  \"Weary Davidson, how long have you been standing there?  I believe you'd come straight down from the sky or straight up from the ground, if you could manage it.  You seem capable of doing everything except coming by the trail like a sensible man.\"  This with severity.  Weary swung a long leg over Glory's back and came lightly to earth, immediately taking possession of the vacant half of doorstep.  The schoolma'am obligingly drew skirts aside to make room for him--an inconsistent movement not at all in harmony with her eyebrows, which were disapproving.  \"Yuh don't like ordinary men.  Yuh said so, once when I said I was just a plain, ordinary man.  I've sworn off being ordinary since yuh gave me that tip,\" he said cheerfully.  \"Let's have a look at that cannon you're hiding under your apron.  Where did yuh resurrect it?  Out of some old Indian grave?  \"Mamma!  It won't go off sudden and unexpected, will it?  What kind uh shells--oh, mamma!\"  He pushed his hat back off his forehead with a gesture not left behind with his boyhood, held the object the length of his long arm away and regarded it gravely.  It was an old, old \"bull-dog\" revolver, freckled with rust until it bore a strong resemblance to certain noses which Miss Satterly looked down upon daily.  The cylinder was plugged with rolls of drab cotton cloth, supposedly in imitation of real bullets.  It was obviously during the plugging process that Miss Satterly had been interrupted, for a drab string hung limply from one hole.  On the whole, the thing did not look particularly formidable, and Weary's lips twitched.  \"A tramp stopped here the other day, and--I was frightened a little,\" she was explaining, pink-cheeked.  \"So aunt Meeker found this up in the loft and she thought it would do to--to bluff with.\"  Weary aimed carefully at a venturesome and highly inquisitive gopher and pulled, with some effort, the rusted trigger.  The gopher stood upon his hind feet and chipped derisively.  \"You see, it just insults him.  Yuh could'nt scare a blind man with it--  Look here!  If yuh go pouting up your lips like that again, something's going to happen 'em.  There's a limit to what a man can stand.\"  Miss Satterly hastily drew her mouth into a thin, untempting, red streak, for she had not seen Weary Davidson, on an average, twice a week for the last four months for nothing.  He was not the man to bluff.  \"Of course,\" she said resentfully, \"you can make fun of it--but all the same, it's better than nothing.  It answers the purpose.\"  Weary turned his head till he could look straight into her eyes--a thing he seemed rather fond of doing, lately.  \"What purpose?  It sure isn't ornamental; it's a little the hardest looker I ever saw in the shape of a gun.  And it won't scare anything.  If you want a gun, why, take one that can make good.  You can have mine; just watch what a different effect it has.\"  He reached backward and drew a shining thing from his pocket, flipped it downward--and the effect was unmistakably different.  The gopher leaped and rolled backward and then lay still, and Miss Satterly gave a little, startled scream and jumped quite off the doorstep.  \"Don't yuh see?  You couldn't raise any such a dust with yours.  If yuh pack a gun, you always want to pack one that's ready and willing to do business on short notice.  I'll let yuh have this, if you're sure it's safe with yuh.  I'd hate to have you shooting yourself accidental.\"  Weary raised innocent eyes to her face and polished the gun caressingly with his handkerchief.  \"Try it once,\" he urged.  The schoolma'am was fond of boasting that she never screamed at anything.  She had screamed just now, over a foolish little thing, and it goes without saying she was angry with the cause.  She did not sit down again beside him, and she did not take the gun he was holding up invitingly to her.  She put her hands behind her and stood accusingly before him with the look upon her face which never failed to make sundry small Beckmans and Pilgreens squirm on their benches when she assumed it in school.  \"Mr. Davidson\"--not Weary Davidson, as she was wont to call him--\"you have killed my pet gopher.  All summer I have fed him, and he would eat out of my hand.\"  Weary cast a jealous eye upon the limp, little animal, searched his heart for remorse and found none.  Ornery little brute, to get familiar with _his_ schoolma'am!  \"I did not think you could be so wantonly cruel, and I am astonished and--and deeply pained to discover that fatal flaw in your character.\"  Weary began to squirm, after the manner of delinquent Beckmans and Pilgreens.  One thing he had learned: When the schoolma'am rose to irreproachable English, there was trouble a-brew.  It was a sign he had never known to fail.  \"I cannot understand the depraved instinct which prompts a man brutally to destroy a life he cannot restore, and which in no way menaces his own--or even interferes with his comfort.  You may apologize to me; you may even be sincerely repentant\"--the schoolma'am's tone at this point implied considerable doubt--\"but you are powerless to return the life you have so heedlessly taken.  You have revealed a low, brutal trait which I had hoped your nature could not harbor, and I am--am deeply shocked and--and grieved.\"  Just here a tiny, dry-weather whirlwind swept around the corner, caught ruffled, white apron and blue skirt in its gyrations and, pushing them wickedly aside, gave Weary a brief, delicious glimpse of two small, slippered feet and two distracting ankles.  The schoolma'am blushed and retreated to the doorstep, but she did not sit down.  She still stood straight and displeased beside him.  Evidently she was still shocked and grieved.  Weary tipped his head to one side so that be might look up at her from under his hat-brim.  \"I'll get yuh another gopher; six, if yuh say so,\" he soothed, \"The woods is full of 'em.\"  The angry, brown eyes of Miss Satterly swept the barren hills contemptuously.  She would not even look at him.  \"Pray do not inconvenience yourself, Mr. Davidson.  It is not the gopher that I care for so much--it is the principle.\"  Weary sighed and slid the gun back into his pocket.  It seemed to him that Miss Satterly, adorable as she always was, was also rather unreasonable at times.  \"All right, I'll get yuh another principle, then.\"  \"Mr. Davidson,\" she said sternly, \"you are perfectly odious!\"  \"Is that something nice, Girlie?\"  Weary smiled trustfully up at her.  \"Odious,\" explained the schoolma'am haughtily, \"is not something nice. I'm sorry your education has been so neglected.  Odious, Mr. Davidson, is a synonym for hateful, obnoxious, repulsive, disagreeable, despicable--\"  \"I never did like cinnamon, anyhow,\" put in Weary, cheerfully.  \"I did not mention cinnamon.  I said--\"  \"Say, yuh look out uh sight with your hair fixed that way.  I wish you'd wear it like that all the time,\" he observed irrelevantly, looking up at her with his sunniest smile.  \"I wish to goodness I were really out of sight,\" snapped the schoolma'am.  \"You make me exceedingly weary.\"  \"_Mrs._ Weary,\" corrected he, complacently.  \"That's what I'm sure aiming at.\"  \"You aim wide of the mark, then,\" she retorted valiantly, though confusion waved a red flag in either cheek.  \"Oh, I don't know.  A minute ago you were roasting me because my aim was too good,\" he contended mildly, glancing involuntarily toward the gopher stretched upon its little, yellow back, its four small feet turned pitifully up to the blue.  \"If you had an atom of decency you'd be ashamed to mention that tribute to your diabolical marksmanship.\"  \"Oh, mamma!\" ejaculated Weary under his breath, and began to make himself a smoke.  His guardian angel was exhorting him to silence, but it preached, as usual, to unsentient ears.  \"_I_ never mentioned all those things,\" he denied meekly.  \"It's you that keeps on mentioning.  I wish yuh wouldn't.  I like to hear you talk, all right, and flop all those big words easy as roping a calf; but I wish you'd let me choose your subject for yuh.  I could easy name one where you could use words just as high and wide and handsome, and a heap more pleasant than the brand you've got corralled.  Try admiration and felicitation and exhilarating, ecstatic osculation--\"  He stopped to run the edge of paper along his tongue, and perhaps it was as well he did; there was no need of making her any angrier.  Miss Satterly hated to feel that she was worsted, and it was quite clear that Weary had all along been \"guying\" her.  \"If you came here to make me _hate_ you, you have accomplished your"]]]
