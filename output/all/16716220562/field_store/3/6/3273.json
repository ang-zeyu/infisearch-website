Its effect, however, upon the immense audience gathered in front of the Capitol seems to have been immediate.  The document had been written with great care at Springfield, some changes being made after the arrival at Washington.  The most important of these were the substitution for the original closing paragraph of the beautiful peroration suggested by Secretary Seward.  In beauty of language and elevation of thought this first public utterance by President Lincoln may be compared to the great political utterances of Burke.  First among the little classics of the world stands the Gettysburg Address.  At the time of its delivery it does not seem to have been generally accepted as a notable utterance.  By many of the newspaper correspondents it was referred to as \"remarks by the President,\" and some of the papers contained no comment upon it.  By others it was dismissed with a few words of mild praise.  Even after the death of Lincoln there was no general agreement as to its supreme merits as a part of our national literature.  Conflicting stories still pass current in books and articles on Lincoln about its composition, and original reception.  An examination of the testimony shows that the following facts may be accepted as fairly proved.  The greater part of the address was written in Washington after very careful preparation, and profound reflection.  The address was read from MS., but with some variations that apparently occurred to the speaker at the time of delivery.  Mr. Everett did not clasp the President's hand while he expressed a willingness to exchange his hundred pages for the twenty lines just read.  It is uncertain whether Lincoln said at the time that the address did not \"scour,\" but if he did use such an expression it was not because of a consciousness of having failed to make adequate preparation for the occasion.  One of the best commentaries on the Second Inaugural Address appeared in an article in the London _Spectator_: \"We cannot read it without a renewed conviction that it is the noblest political document known to history, and should have for the nation and the statesmen he left behind him something of a sacred and almost prophetic character.\"  Carl Schurz compared it to a sacred poem, and all discriminating readers agree in placing it by the side of the Gettysburg Address as an almost perfect specimen of pure English prose.  The other addresses of the presidential period are, with the exception of the last speech, on the reconstruction of Louisiana, of minor importance.  They consist in the main of responses to serenades, a form of address which Lincoln cordially detested and in which as a rule he achieved only a moderate degree of success.  The cares of his great office made such cruel demands upon his time and strength that he declined many requests to speak in public, and whenever he did appear he confined his remarks within the smallest possible limits. Furthermore, Lincoln was not a reader speaker and rarely did himself justice without careful preparation.  Writers on Lincoln have failed to note the severe criticisms upon Lincoln's impromptu remarks that appeared in the opposition press and in the English newspapers.  Even as late as 1863 newspaper writers not opposed to him did not hesitate to refer to the plainness of the President's public speaking.  The Messages to Congress are distinguished from most documents of that class by their frequent purple patches.  To the enumeration of dry facts furnished by the various departments they add an elevation and breadth of thought of the first order.  In a class by themselves are the various proclamations, some of them of a purely formal character, such as those announcing blockades, others of a distinctly literary character, like the announcements of fasts and feasts.  Midway between these two classes is the most important of all, the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, which, with the exception of the concluding sentence, is entirely free from ornament. Perhaps Lincoln felt here, as with the Debates, that the occasion was too serious, not only for jesting but even for attempting the mere graces of language.  Finally, mention should be made of the letters and telegrams written by President Lincoln.  Although many letters have been preserved from earlier times, none make special claims to attention outside of the information that they furnish.  But during the last four years of his life Lincoln wrote some of the most beautiful letters that have ever been composed.  One of these, the letter to Mrs. Bixby, has been given a place on the walls of one of the Oxford colleges, as a model of noble English.  The Conkling letter and the letter to Horace Greeley are among the most important statements of Lincoln's policy and are really short political tracts.  The First Inaugural can be traced through the Cooper Union Address and the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, the Peoria Speech, and the speeches of 1854 to the seed of 1832, the plain, logical, direct statement of principles of Lincoln's first address to the public.  The development of the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural, those supreme expressions of Lincoln's feelings, is not, in the main, to be traced through complete speeches, but it must be sought for in isolated passages, when he left logic for the moment and gave himself up to the passing emotion.  The real seed of the majestic simplicity of those addresses is perhaps to be found in those rhetorical speeches of an early period, so lacking apparently in the qualities that we love and admire.  In writing, as in so many other things, we reap not what we sow, but its fruition.  The effect may seem very remotely related to the cause, but he would be a fool who would deny the relation between them.     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE  The complete works of Abraham Lincoln have been compiled and edited by his biographers, John G. Nicolay and John Hay (two vols., Century Company).  Their life of Lincoln in ten volumes (Century Company) is the standard authority.  There is also an excellent condensation in one volume.  Other biographies are by W. H. Herndon, Lincoln's law partner (two vols., Putnam); by Miss Ida Tarbell (two vols., McClure); by John T. Morse, Jr., in the American Statesmen Series (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.); and by Norman Hapgood (Macmillan).  Among the many tributes to Lincoln, are the essays by James Russell Lowell, Carl Schurz, the address by Emerson; and poems by Stedman, Bryant, Holmes, Stoddard, Gilder, and Whitman, and the noble lines in Lowell's Commemoration Ode.  The student of Lincoln's writings should be familiar with the history of the United States, and should consult the standard histories for explanation of the references to events in the long struggle which culminated in the Civil War.

SELECTIONS FROM INAUGURALS, ADDRESSES AND LETTERS   ABRAHAM LINCOLN     LINCOLN'S INAUGURALS, ADDRESSES AND LETTERS  ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON COUNTY, MARCH 9, 1832  FELLOW-CITIZENS: Having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives in the next General Assembly of this state, in accordance with an established custom and the principles of true republicanism, it becomes my duty to make known to you--the people whom I propose to represent--my sentiments with regard to local affairs.  Time and experience have verified to a demonstration, the public utility of internal improvements.  That the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no person will deny.  But yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other kind, without first knowing that we are able to finish them--as half finished work generally proves to be labor lost. There cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to other good things, provided they cost nothing.  The only objection is to paying for them; and the objection to paying arises from the want of ability to pay.  With respect to the county of Sangamon, some more easy means of communication than we now possess, for the purpose of facilitating the task of exporting the surplus products of its fertile soil, and importing necessary articles from abroad, are indispensably necessary. A meeting has been held of the citizens of Jacksonville, and the adjacent country, for the purpose of deliberating and enquiring into the expediency of constructing a railroad from some eligible point on the Illinois river, through the town of Jacksonville, in Morgan county, to the town of Springfield in Sangamon county.  This is, indeed, a very desirable object.  No other improvement that reason will justify us in hoping for, can equal in utility the railroad.  It is a never failing source of communication, between places of business remotely situated from each other.  Upon the railroad the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted by either high or low water, or freezing weather, which are the principal difficulties that render our future hopes of water communication precarious and uncertain.  Yet, however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be; however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it--there is always a heart appalling shock accompanying the account of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations. The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at $290,000;--the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is sufficient to justify the belief, that the improvement of the Sangamon river is an object much better suited to our infant resources.  Respecting this view, I think I may say, without the fear of being contradicted, that its navigation may be rendered completely practicable, as high as the mouth of the South Fork, or probably higher, to vessels of from 25 to 30 tons burthen, for at least one half of all common years, and to vessels of much greater burthen a part of that time.  From my peculiar circumstances, it is probable that for the last twelve months I have given as particular attention to the stage of the water in this river, as any other person in the country.  In the month of March, 1831, in company with others, I commenced the building of a flatboat on the Sangamon, and finished and took her out in the course of the spring.  Since that time, I have been concerned in the mill at New Salem.  These circumstances are sufficient evidence, that I have not been very inattentive to the stages of the water.--The time at which we crossed the milldam, being in the last days of April, the water was lower than it had been since the breaking of winter in February, or than it was for several weeks after.  The principal difficulties we encountered in descending the river, were from the drifted timber, which obstructions all know is not difficult to be removed.  Knowing almost precisely the height of water at that time, I believe I am safe in saying that it has as often been higher as lower since.  From this view of the subject, it appears that my calculations with regard to the navigation of the Sangamon, cannot be unfounded in reason; but whatever may be its natural advantages, certain it is, that it never can be practically useful to any great extent, without being greatly improved by art.  The drifted timber, as I have before mentioned, is the most formidable barrier to this object.  Of all parts of this river, none will require so much labor in proportion, to make it navigable as the last thirty or thirty-five miles; and going with the meanderings of the channel, when we are this distance above its mouth, we are only between twelve and eighteen miles above Beardstown in something near a straight direction, and this route is upon such low ground as to retain water in many places during the season, and in all parts such as to draw two-thirds or three-fourths of the river water at all stages.  This route is up on prairieland the whole distance;--so that it appears to me, by removing the turf, a sufficient width, and damming up the old channel, the whole river in a short time would wash its way through, thereby curtailing the distance, and increasing the velocity of the current very considerably, while there would be no timber upon the banks to obstruct its navigation in future; and being nearly straight, the timber which might float in at the head, would be apt to go clear through.  There are also many places above this where the river, in its zigzag course, forms such complete peninsulas, as to be easier cut through at the necks than to remove the obstructions from the bends--which if done, would also lessen the distance.  What the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say.  It is probable, however, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length.  Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon river, to be vastly important and highly desirable to the improvement of the county; and if elected, any measure in the legislature having this for its object, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and shall receive my support.  It appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest, has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose I may enter upon it without claiming the honor, or risking the danger, which may await"]]]
