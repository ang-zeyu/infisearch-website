Big corporations are all right on enforcing morality until it hits their dividends too hard.  Then you'll find that the directors will be urging us to let gambling go on again if the laborers insist on having it.\"  \"Well, we won't have gambling in the camp, anyway,\" Harry retorted stubbornly.  \"We're simply looking after the interests of the men themselves.  I wonder why they can't see it, and act like men, not fools.\"  \"We're going to stop the gambling, and keep it stopped,\" Tom went on, his jaws setting firmly together.  \"But, Harry, we're going to have a big row on our hands, and various attempts against the company's property will be made.\"  \"If the company's officers order us to let up on the gambling,\" proposed Harry, \"we can resign and get out of this business altogether.\"  \"We won't resign, and we won't knuckle down to any lot of swindlers either, Harry!\" cried Tom.  \"Some one is fighting us, and this wreck of a sea-wall is the first proof.  All right!  If any one wants to fight us he shall find that we know how to fight back, and that we can hit hard.  Harry, from this minute on we're after those crooks, and we'll make them realize that there's some sting to us!\"  \"Good enough!\" cheered Hazelton.  \"I like that old-time fight talk!  But are you going to do anything to protect the wall to-night, Tom?\"  \"I am,\" announced the young chief engineer.  \"What's the plan?\"  \"Let me think,\" urged Reade.  \"Now, I believe, I have it.  We'll send one of the motor boats out here, with a foreman and four laborers.  They can arm themselves with clubs and patrol the water on both sides of the wall. The 'Thomas Morton' has a small search-light on her that will be of use in keeping a close eye over the wall.\"  \"That ought to stop the nonsense,\" Harry nodded.  \"But I don't imagine that any further efforts to destroy the wall will be made tonight, anyway.\"  \"We'll have the night patrol out _every_ night after this,\" Tom declared. \"But I'm not so sure either, that another effort won't be made to-night, if we don't put a watch on to stop this wicked business.  Harry, do you mind remaining out here while I run back and get the boat out?\"  \"Why should I mind?\" Hazelton wanted to know.  \"Well, I didn't know whether you would, or not---after seeing that imaginary something behind you.\"  \"Don't laugh at me!  I may have had a start, but you ought to be the first to know, Tom, that I haven't frozen feet.\"  \"I do know it, Harry.  You've been through too many perils to be suspected of cowardice.  Well, then, I'll run back.\"  Tom Reade had really intended to leave the flash lamp with his chum, but he forgot to do so, and, as he jogged steadily along over the wall he threw the light ahead of him.  As he got nearer shore Tom increased his jog to a brisk run.  Once, on the way, he passed the prowling negro without knowing it.  That huge fellow, seeing the ray of light come steadily near him, hesitated for a few moments, then took to the water, swimming well out.  After Reade had passed, the fellow swam in toward the wall.  Up on the wall climbed the negro.  For a few minutes he crouched there, shaking the water from his garments.  Then, cautiously, he began to crawl forward.  \"Boss Reade, he done gone in,\" muttered the prowler.  \"Boss Hazelton, Ah reckon he's mah poultry!\"  Harry, keeping his lone vigil away out on the narrow retaining wall, was growing sleepy.  He had nearly forgotten his scare.  Indeed, he was inclined to look upon it as a trick of his own brain.     CHAPTER II  THE CALL OF ONE IN TROUBLE   Once Tom Reade reached the solid land he let his long legs out into a brisk run.  With his years of practice on the Gridley High School athletic team he was not one to lose his wind readily.  So he made his way at the same speed all the way up to the camp.  \"Who dar?\" called a negro watchman, as Tom raced up to the outskirts of the camp.  \"Reade, chief engineer,\" Tom called, then wheeled and made off to the right, where the more substantial barracks of the foremen stood. Superintendent Renshaw lived in a two-story barrack still farther to the right, as the guest of the young engineers.  \"_Quien vive_?\" (who's there?) hailed another voice, between the two barracks buildings.  \"So, Nicolas, you rascal, you haven't gone to bed?\" demanded Tom, halting. \"What did I tell you about earlier hours?\"  Nicolas was the young Mexican servant whom Tom and Harry had brought back with them from Mexico.  Readers of the previous volume know all about this faithful fellow.  \"You and Senor Hazelton, you waire not in bed,\" replied Nicolas stolidly.  \"You're not expected to stay up and watch over us as if we were babies, Nicolas,\" spoke Tom, in a gentler voice.  \"You'd better turn in now.\"  \"Senor Hazelton, where is he?\" insisted Nicolas, anxiously.  \"Oh, bother!  Never mind where he is,\" Tom rejoined.  \"We won't either of us be in for a little while yet.  But you turn in now---at once---instanter!\"  Then Tom bounded over to the little porch before the foremen's barracks, where he pounded lustily on the door.  \"Who's there?  What's wanted?\" demanded a sleepy voice from the inside.  \"Is that you, Evarts?\" called Reade.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Get on your duds and turn out as quickly as you can.\"  \"You want me?\" yawned Evarts.  \"Now, see here, my man, if I didn't want you why on earth would I call you out in the middle of the night?\"  \"It's late,\" complained Evarts.  \"I know it.  That's why I want you to get behind yourself and push yourself,\" retorted the young chief engineer energetically.  \"Hustle!\"  Twice, while he waited impatiently, Tom kicked the toe of one boot against the door to emphasize the need of haste.  Other drowsy voices remonstrated.  \"Hang a man who has to sleep _all_ the time!\" grunted Tom Reade.  After several minutes the door opened, and a lanky, loose-jointed, lantern-jawed man of some forty-odd years stepped out.  \"Well, what's up, Mr. Reade?\" questioned the foreman, hiding a yawn behind a bony, hairy hand.  \"You are, at last, thank goodness!\" Tom exclaimed.  \"Evarts, I want you to rout out four good men.  Lift 'em to their feet and begin to throw the clothes on 'em!\"  \"It's pretty late to call men out of their beds, sir,\" mildly objected the foreman.  \"No---it's early, but it can't be helped,\" Tom Reade retorted.  \"Hustle 'em out!\"  \"Black or white?\" sleepily inquired Evarts.  \"White, and Americans at that,\" Tom retorted.  \"Put none but Americans on guard tonight, Evarts!  What do you suppose has happened?\"  \"Can't guess.\"  \"No!  You're still too sleepy.  Evarts, some scoundrels have blown out a good part of our wall yonder.\"  \"Are you joking, Mr. Reade?\"  \"No, sir; I am not.  Dynamite must have been used.  Hazelton and I heard the noise of the blast, but of course we got out there too late to catch any miscreant at the job.\"  Evarts, at first, was inclined to regard the news with mild disbelief, but he soon realized that something must have happened very nearly as the young chief engineer had described.  \"Well, what are you standing there for?\" Tom demanded, impatiently.  \"Are you going to wait for daylight?  Get the four men out---all Americans, mind you.  _Hustle_, man!\"  Evarts started away; toward the camp over to the left of them.  As he did so Tom darted in another direction.  Two minutes later Tom was back, piloting by one arm a man who was still engaged in rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.  This was Conlon, engineer of the motor boat, \"Morton.\"  \"Where's Evarts?\" Reade queried, impatiently.  \"Oh, Evarts!  Where are you, and what are you doing?\"  \"Trying to get four men awake,\" bawled back the voice of the foreman, from the distance.  \"As soon as I get one man on his feet the other three have sunk back to sleep.\"  \"Wait until I get over there then!\" called Tom, striding forward.  \"Come along, Conlon!  Don't you lag on me.\"  \"There!  Do you fellows reckon you want Mr. Reade to bump in here and shake you out?\" sounded the warning voice of Evarts.  As Tom and the motor boat's engine tender reached the little, box-like shack from which Evarts's tones proceeded, four men, seated on the floor, were seen to be lacing their shoes by the dim light of a lantern.  \"A nice lot you are!\" called Tom crisply.  \"How many hours does it take you to get awake when you're called in the middle of the night?\"  \"This overtime warn't in the agreement,\" sleepily retorted one of the men.  \"You're wrong there,\" Reade informed him, vehemently.  \"Overtime _is_ in the agreement for every man in this camp when it's wanted of him---from the chief engineer all along the line.  Now, you men oblige me by hustling. I don't want to wait more than sixty seconds for the last man of you.\"  \"I've a good mind to crawl back into my bunk,\" growled another of the men.  \"All right,\" retorted Tom Reade, with suspicious cheerfulness.  \"Try it and see what kind of fireworks I carry concealed on my person.  Or, just lag a little bit on me, and you'll see the same thing.  Men, do you realize that there's foul play afoot out on the retaining wall?  We've got to go out there in time to stop anything more happening.  Now, you've got your shoes on; grab the rest of your clothing and hustle it on as we make for the beach.  Come along!\"  Tom fairly got behind the men and pushed them outside.  They would have liked to complain, but they didn't.  Some of them were larger and heavier than the chief engineer, but they knew quite well that, at sign of any trifling mutiny to-night, Reade would thrash them all.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14369"],["title","The Young Engineers on the Gulf (#3)"],["body","\"If any one is trying to blow up the wall, Mr. Reade, it's all your fault, anyway,\" ventured Evarts, as the little party started at a brisk walk for the beach.  \"When you've got a mixed crowd of men working for you, you shouldn't interfere too much with their amusements.  Yet you would have the gamblers run out of camp just when our boys were getting ready to have some pleasant evenings.\"  \"I'll run out any one else who attempts to bring disorderly doings into this camp,\" Tom retorted quietly.  \"Then there'll be some more of your seawalls blown up,\" Evarts warned him gloomily.  \"If such a thing happens again there'll be some men hurt, and some others breaking into prison,\" Tom answered with spirit.  \"Any evildoers that try to set themselves up in business around here will soon wish they had kept away---that's all.\"  \"It's a bad business,\" insisted Evarts, wagging his head.  \"When you have a mixed crowd of workmen---\"  \"I think you've said that before,\" Tom broke in coolly.  \"To-night we're in too much of a hurry to listen to the same thing twice.  Come on, men. You can go a little faster than a walk.  Jog a bit---I'll show you how.\"  \"This is pretty hard on men in the middle of the night,\" hinted Evarts, after the jogging had gone on for a full minute.  \"It ain't right to-----\"  \"Stop it, Evarts!\" Tom cut in crisply.  \"I don't mind a little grumbling at the right time, and I often do a bit myself, but not when I'm as rushed as I am to-night.  There's the dock ahead, men---a little faster spurt now!\"  Tom urged his men along to the dock.  With no loss of time they tumbled aboard the \"Morton,\" a broad, somewhat shallow, forty-foot motor boat of open construction.  \"Get up and take the wheel, Evarts,\" Tom.  directed.  \"Get at work on your spark, Conlon, and I'll throw the drive-wheel over for you.  Some of you men cast, off!\"  In a very short time the \"Morton\" was going \"put-put-put\" away from the dock.  Tom, after seeing that everything was moving satisfactorily, turned around to look at the four men huddled astern.  \"Don't any of you go to sleep,\" he urged.  \"A good part of our success depends on how well you all keep awake and use your eyes and ears.\"  That said, Tom Reade hastened forward, stationing himself close to Evarts, who had the steering wheel.  Some of the men astern began to talk.  \"Silence, if you please,\" Tom called softly.  \"Don't talk except on matters of business.  We want to be able to use our ears.  Conlon, make your engine a little less noisy if you can.\"  Now Reade had leisure to wonder how matters had gone with Harry Hazelton.  \"Of course that threatening figure Harry saw behind him was an imaginary one,\" Tom said to himself, but he felt uneasy nevertheless.  A few moments later Reade clutched at one of Evarts's arms.  \"Did you hear that, man?\" the young engineer demanded.  \"Hear what?\" Evarts wanted to know.  \"It sounded like a yell out there yonder,\" Tom rejoined.  \"Didn't hear it, Mr. Reade.\"  \"There it goes again!\" cried Tom, leaping up.  \"Some one is calling my name.  It must be Harry Hazelton, and he must want help.  Conlon, slam it to that engine of yours!\"     CHAPTER III  VANISHING INTO THIN AIR   Left by himself Harry had stood, at first, motionless, or nearly so.  He strained his hearing in trying to detect any unusual sound of the night, since it was so dark that vision would not aid him much.  There was nothing, however, but the mournful sighing of the wind and the lapping of the waves.  It seemed to Hazelton that the wind was growing gradually more brisk and the waves larger, but he was not sure of that until the water commenced splashing across his shoes.  The footway on the masonry became more slippery in consequence.  \"With these rocks well wet down I wouldn't care much about having to run back to the land,\" muttered Harry, dryly.  \"However, I won't have to go back on my own feet.  Tom will have the boat out here, and undoubtedly he will plan to have us both taken back to shore after we get through cruising around here.  We should have brought the boat out in the first place.\"  A night bird screamed, then flapped its wings close to Harry's face in its flight past him.  The young engineer saw the moving wings for an instant; then they vanished into the black beyond.  Farther out some other kind of bird screamed.  The whole situation was a weird one, but Harry was no coward, though a less courageous youth would have found the situation hard on his nerves.  Still another night bird screamed, of some species with which Hazelton was wholly unacquainted.  The cry was answered by some sort of strange call from the shore.  \"It's a fine thing that I'm not superstitious,\" laughed the young engineer to himself, \"or I'd surely feel cold chills chasing each other up and down my spine.\"  As it was, Harry shivered slightly, though not from fear.  With the increasing wind it was growing chilly out there for one who could not warm himself with exercise.  \"It's a long time, or it seems so,\" muttered the young engineer presently. \"Yet I'll wager that Tom is hustling himself and others on the very jump.\"  Again the call of a night bird, and once more a sound from shore seemed to answer it.  \"Real birds?\" wondered Hazelton, with a start of sudden curiosity.  \"Or have I been listening to human signals?  If so, the signals can't cover any good or honest purpose.\"  That train of thought set him to listening more acutely than before.  Yet, as no more calls reached his ears the attention of the young engineer soon began to flag.  The monotonous lapping of the waves against the stone wall, the constant splashing of water over the rocks and the steady blowing of the wind all tended to make the watcher feel drowsy.  \"What on earth can be keeping good old Tom?\" Harry wondered, more than once.  It would have been well, indeed, had Harry kept his eyes turned oftener toward the shore end of the wall.  In that case he might more speedily have detected the wriggling, snake-like movement of the big negro moving toward him.  With great caution the huge prowler came onward, raising his head a few inches every now and then and listening.  The black man's nostrils moved feverishly.  He was using them, as a dog would have done, to scent any signs of alarm on the part of the human quarry that he was after.  At last Harry Hazelton turned sharply, for his own ears were attuned to the stillnesses of the western forests and his hearing was unusually acute. He had just heard a sound on the wall, not far away.  Instantly the young engineer was on the alert.  Then his eyes, piercing the darkness, made out the crawling, dark form, which did not appear to be more than fifty feet away from him.  For a second or two Harry stared.  But he knew there could be no snake as broad as this crawling figure appeared to be.  \"Who's there?\" Hazelton called quickly.  The writhing mass became still, flattening itself against the bed of rock. Hazelton was not to be deceived, however.  \"Who's there?\" Harry repeated.  \"You had better talk up, my man!\"  Still no sound.  Harry started forward to investigate.  His foot touched against a good sized fragment of rock left there by one of the masons.  Without delay Harry reached down, picking up the rock, which was rather more than half as large as his head.  Holding this in his right hand Harry advanced with still more confidence, for he felt himself to be armed.  Hazelton had been a clever pitcher in his high school days and knew that he could make this fragment of rock land pretty close to where he wanted it to go.  \"Who are you?\" demanded Hazelton, once more, as he stepped cautiously forward.  \"No use in your keeping silent, my man.  I see you and know that you're there.  Moreover, I'm going to drag the truth out of you as to what you're doing out here on the wall at this hour of the night---and to-night of all nights.\"  Still no answer; Harry went steadily forward, until he was within a dozen feet of the head of the flattened brute in human guise.  Hazelton could now see every line of his adversary plainly, though he could not make out the fellow's face.  \"You'd better get up and talk,\" warned Harry, poising the rock fragment for a throw.  \"If you don't you'll cast all the more suspicion upon yourself.  For the last time, my man, who are you and what are you doing here?\"  The huge black figure might have been a log for all the answer that came forth.  \"All right, then; it's your own fault,\" Harry Hazelton continued calmly. \"As you won't speak I'm going to crack the nut for myself.  Your head will be the nut, and this rock I have in my hand shall be the hammer.  I'm going to slam this rock on your head with all the force I've got, and I'm a good, straight thrower.\"  Yet, though Hazelton spoke with such confidence, he was far from meaning all he said.  In the first place, he had no legal right, under the circumstances, to go as close to murder as it might be for him to throw the rock at the rascal's head.  Moreover, Harry would hardly have exercised such a legal right, had he possessed it, without the strongest provocation.  From the black prowler came a sudden, fierce snort.  It sounded altogether like defiance.  \"Ho---ho!  You're finding your voice, are you, my man?\" Hazelton jeered. \"Then talk up in time to save yourself!\"  Instead the huge black man began to writhe forward.  \"Stop that!\" ordered Harry dangerously.  He did not retreat from the writhing human thing, but he took better aim, noting that the black man was hatless and that his head offered a fair mark.  \"You're going to get hurt in just about a second more,\" he added.  Uttering another snort the bulky black sprang to his feet with surprising agility in one of his great size.  Harry now let his right hand fall back quickly.  He was poising for the throw in earnest, for there could no longer be any doubt that the stranger was planning a deadly assault.  \"Take it, then, since you want it!\" snapped out Harry Hazelton.
