On one of these occasions he had written to them saying that he thought it would be for the happiness of them all if they were to leave Penfold Hall and set up an establishment of their own. But upon his return he found things going on exactly as before, and Miss Penfold had spoken somewhat severely of the silly letter he had written to them, a letter displaying at once such ingratitude and folly that it had been beneath them to notice it. As Herbert Penfold was in a way really fond of his sisters, who spared no effort in making his home comfortable for him, and who allowed him to have his own way in all minor matters, he could not bring himself to repeat when face to face with them the opinion he had expressed in writing; and so things had gone on for years.  The Miss Penfolds were really anxious to see their brother married. Provided only that it was to a lady who would be, in their estimation, fitted for him, and who would also have a feeling of gratitude towards themselves for their share in installing her as mistress of the Hall, they were quite prepared to abdicate in her favor, and to retire to some pretty house near a pleasant watering-place, paying visits once or twice a year to the Hall.  The listless life their brother led was a source of grief to them; for they were really attached to him, and believed that they had in every way been working for his happiness.  They had no shadow of regret for the part they had played in breaking off his engagement with Mary Vernon. Having once convinced themselves that she was a frivolous girl, quite unsuited for the position of mistress of Penfold Hall, they had regarded it as an absolute duty to protect Herbert from the consequences of what they considered his infatuation. Consequently, for years they were in the habit of inviting for long visits young ladies whom they considered in every way eligible as their successor, and had been much grieved at their want of success, and at the absolute indifference with which Herbert regarded the presence of these young women. When, four years after his marriage to Mary Vernon, Mr. Conway had died suddenly they had been seized with a vague disquiet; for they believed that the remembrance of his first love was the real cause of Herbert's indifference to others, and considered it probable he might still be sufficiently infatuated with her to attempt to undo the past.  To their gratification Herbert never alluded to the subject, never, so far as they knew, made the slightest effort to renew her acquaintance. In fact, Herbert Penfold was a diffident as well as a weak man. Once convinced that he had acted badly toward Mary Vernon, he was equally convinced that she must despise him and that he was utterly unworthy of her. Had it been otherwise he would have again entered the lists and tried to recover the love he had thrown away.  Although he occasionally yielded to the entreaties of his sisters and showed himself with them at county gatherings, gave stately dinner-parties at regular intervals, and accepted the invitations of his neighbors, he lived the life almost of a recluse.  His sole companion and friend was the rector of the parish, who had been his tutor during his Continental tour, and whom he had presented with the living which was in his gift, to the secret dissatisfaction of his sisters, who had always considered that Herbert's tutor had endeavored to set him against them. This had to some extent been the case, in so far, at least, that Mr. Withers, who had left college only a short time before starting with Herbert, had endeavored to give him habits of self-reliance and independence of thought, and had quietly striven against the influence that his sisters had upon his mind. It was not until after the Mary Vernon episode that the living had fallen vacant; had it been otherwise things might have turned out differently, for Herbert would certainly have sought his friend's advice in his troubles.  After that it was too late for his interference. Mr. Withers had watched the state of matters at the Hall, and his young wife had often urged him to try to induce Herbert Penfold to rouse himself and assert himself against his sisters, but the vicar remained neutral. He saw that though at times Herbert was a little impatient at the domination of his sisters, and a chance word showed that he nourished a feeling of resentment toward them, he was actually incapable of nerving himself to the necessary effort required to shake off their influence altogether, and to request them to leave the Hall.  Nothing short of this would suffice to establish his independence; for after a mere temporary assertion of authority he would, if they remained there, assuredly speedily allow affairs to lapse into their present state, and the vicar thought that harm rather than good would be caused by his interference, and that, as his influence would be sure to be suspected, there would be a breach between the Hall and the Rectory. As it was the connection was an intimate one. Herbert was always glad to see him when he came in for a talk in the course of his rounds, or when he and his wife would come up to dine quietly. The Miss Penfolds were always ready with their purses to aid him to carry out his schemes for the good of the parish, and to sympathize with his young wife in her troubles; for of these she had a large share--all her children, save one girl, having been carried off in their infancy.  Mabel Withers was as much at home at the Hall as at the Rectory. She was chief pet and favorite with Mr. Penfold; and although his sisters considered that the rector allowed her to run wild, and that under such license she was growing up a sad tomboy, they could not withstand the influence of the child's happy and fearless disposition, and were in their way very kind to her.  Such was the state of things at Penfold Hall when its owner's sudden announcement that he had invited young Ralph Conway to come to stay there had fallen like a bombshell upon his sisters.  The invitation had caused almost as much surprise to Mrs. Conway as to the Miss Penfolds. Her father had died a few months after her marriage, and at the death of her husband she found herself left with an income of about a hundred a year--the interest of the sum for which he had insured his life.  To her surprise she had a month or two later received an intimation from the lawyer who managed her business that a friend had arranged to pay the sum of a hundred pounds every quarter to her account, on condition only that no inquiry whatever should be made as to his or her identity. Mary Conway had thankfully accepted the gift, which had, however, caused her intense wonderment and curiosity. So far as she knew neither her father nor her husband had any relations who could have afforded so handsome a gift. She knew that Colonel Vernon had been most popular with his regiment, and the supposition at which she finally arrived was that some young officer whom he had befriended in difficulties had, on coming into a large property, determined similarly to befriend the daughter of his former colonel.  Had she been alone in the world she would have declined to accept this aid from an unknown benefactor, but for her son's sake she felt that it would be wrong to do so. The idea that the money might come from Herbert Penfold had once or twice occurred to her, only to be at once dismissed, for had she really believed that it came from him she could not, even for Ralph's sake, have accepted it. He had, as she believed, quarreled with her altogether without cause, her letters had been unanswered, and she considered the quarrel to have been simply a pretext upon the part of Herbert to break off an engagement of which he was tired. Words dropped, apparently by accident, by Herbert's sisters had, before the misunderstanding commenced, favored this idea, and although she had really loved him her disposition was too spirited to allow her to take the steps she otherwise might have done to set herself right with him.  At any rate she had no ground whatever for believing that Herbert, after the breach of the engagement, entertained any such feelings toward her as would have led him to come forward to assist her in any way after she had become the wife of another; and so for twelve years she had continued to receive her quarterly income. She had established herself in a pretty little house near Dover, where several old friends of her father resided, and where she had plenty of pleasant society among the officers of the regiments stationed there. Although far from rivaling Portsmouth or Plymouth in life and bustle, Dover was a busy town during the time of the great war. The garrison was a large one, the channel cruisers often anchored under the guns of the castle, and from the top of the hills upon a clear day for months a keen lookout was kept for the appearance from the port of Boulogne of the expedition Napoleon had gathered there for the invasion of England.  The white sails of the English cruisers as they sailed up or down the channel were clearly visible, and occasionally a privateer could be seen making its way westward with a prize it had picked up off Texel. Military and naval matters were the sole topics of conversation, and by the time he was fifteen Ralph had fully determined to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and to become a soldier. Having passed almost all her life among military men Mrs. Conway had offered no objections to his wishes, and as several of her father's old friends had promised to use their influence on his behalf, there was little doubt that he would be enabled to procure a commission as soon as he reached the regulation age.  It was not often that the postman called at Mrs. Conway's with letters; for postage was expensive, and the people in those"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14313"],["title","One of the 28th: A Tale of Waterloo (#2)"],["body","only wrote when they had something particular to say. Mrs. Conway had just made breakfast when Ralph came in with a letter in his hand.  \"Here is a letter for you, mother; but please don't open it until you have given me my breakfast. I am very late now, and shall barely have time to get through with it and be there before the gates close.\"  \"Your porridge is quite ready for you, Ralph; so if you are late it will be your own fault not mine. The eggs will be in before you have eaten it. However, I won't open the letter until you have gone, because you will only waste time by asking questions about it.\"  Ralph began his bread and milk, and Mrs. Conway, stretching out her hand, took the letter he had laid beside his plate, and turning it over glanced at the direction to ascertain from which of her few correspondents it came. For a moment she looked puzzled, then, with a little start, she laid it down by the side of her plate. She had recognized the handwriting once so familiar to her.  \"What is it, mother? You look quite startled. Who is it from?\"  \"It is from no one you know, Ralph. I think it is from a person I have not heard from for some years. At any rate it will keep until you are off to school.\"  \"It's nothing unpleasant, I hope, mother. Your color has quite gone, and you look downright pale.\"  \"What should be the matter, you silly boy?\" Mrs. Conway said, with an attempt to smile. \"What could there be unpleasant in a letter from a person I have not heard from for years? There, go on with your breakfast. I expect you will hear some news when you get down into the town, for the guns in the castle have been firing, and I suppose there is news of a victory. They said yesterday that a great battle was expected to be fought against Napoleon somewhere near Leipzig.\"  \"Yes; I heard the guns, mother, and I expect there has been a victory. I hope not.\"  \"Why do you hope not, Ralph?\"  \"Why, of course, mother, I don't want the French to be beaten--not regularly beaten, till I am old enough to have a share in it. Just fancy what a nuisance it would be if peace was made just as I get my commission.\"  \"There will be plenty of time for you, Ralph,\" his mother said smiling. \"Peace has been patched up once or twice, but it never lasts long; and after fighting for the last twenty years it is hardly probable that the world is going to grow peaceful all at once. But there, it is time for you to be off; it only wants ten minutes to nine and you will have to run fast all the way to be in time.\"  When Mrs. Conway was alone she took up the letter, and turned it over several times before opening it.  What could Herbert Penfold have written about after all these years? Mrs. Conway was but thirty-six years old now, and was still a pretty woman, and a sudden thought sent a flush of color to her face. \"Never!\" she said decidedly. \"After the way in which he treated me he cannot suppose that now--\" and then she stopped. \"I know I did love him once, dearly, and it nearly broke my heart; but that was years and years ago. Well, let us see what he says for himself,\" and she broke open the letter. She glanced through it quickly, and then read it again more carefully. She was very pale now, and her lips trembled as she laid down the letter.  \"So,\" she said to herself in a low tone, \"it is to him after all I owe all this,\" and she looked round her pretty room; \"and I never once really suspected it. I am glad now,\" she went on after a pause, \"that I did not; for, of course, it would have been impossible to have taken it, and how different the last twelve years of my life would have been. Poor Herbert! And so he really suffered too, and he has thought of me all this time.\"  For fully half an hour she sat without moving, her thoughts busy with the past, then she again took up the letter and reread it several times. Its contents were as follows:      \"Dear Mrs. Conway: You will be doubtless surprised at seeing my     handwriting, and your first impulse will naturally be to put this     letter into the fire. I am not writing to ask you to forgive my     conduct in the old days. I am but too well aware how completely I     have forfeited all right to your esteem or consideration. Believe     me that I have suffered for my fault, and that my life has been a     ruined one. I attempt to make no excuses. I am conscious that     while others were to blame I was most of all, and that it is to my     own weakness of will and lack of energy that the breach between us     was due. However, all this is of the past and can now interest you     but little. You have had your own sorrows and trials, at which,     believe me, I sincerely grieved. And now to my object in writing     to you. Although still comparatively a young man, I have not many     years to live. When last in London I consulted two of the first     physicians, and they agreed that, as I had already suspected, I     was suffering from heart disease, or rather, perhaps, from an     enfeebled state of my heart, which may at any moment cease to do     its work.      \"Naturally then, I have turned my thoughts as to whom I should     leave my property. My sisters are amply provided for. I have no     other near relatives, and therefore consider myself free to leave     it as I choose. I have long fixed my thoughts upon the daughter of     a dear friend, the rector of Bilston; she is now thirteen years     old, and half my property is left her. I have left the other half     to your son. The whole subject to an annuity to yourself; which     you will not, I trust, refuse to accept. I have never thought of     any woman but you, and I hope that you will not allow your just     resentment against me to deprive me of the poor satisfaction of     making what atonement lies in my power for the cruel wrong I     formerly did you.      \"Were I strong and in health I can well imagine that you would     indignantly refuse to receive any benefits from my hands, but     knowing your kindness of heart, I feel sure that you will not     sadden the last days of a doomed man by the knowledge that even     after his death his hopes of insuring the comfort of the one woman     on earth he cared for are to be disappointed.      \"I should like to know your son. Would it be too much to ask you     to spare him for a while from time to time so long as I live? I     have a double motive, I say frankly, in thus asking him to come     here. I wish him and my little pet, Mabel Withers, to come to like     each other. I wish to divide my property between them, and yet I     should be glad if the whole estate could remain intact.      \"I should not be so foolish as to make a proviso that two persons     who are as yet so young, and who may not in any way be suitable to     each other, should marry, but nothing would please me so much as     that they should take a fancy to each other; and thrown together     as they would be here, for Mabel is constantly at the house, it is     just possible that one of those boy and girl affections, which do     sometimes, although perhaps rarely, culminate in marriage, might     spring up between them. Whether that may be so in the present case     I must leave to fate, but I should at any rate like to pave the     way for such an arrangement by bringing the young people together.     I need not say that it will be best that neither of them should     have the slightest idea of what is in my mind, for this would be     almost certain to defeat my object.      \"If the proposal is agreeable to you, I hope that you will let     Ralph come to me at the beginning of his holidays; which must, I     fancy, be now near at hand. I think it will be as well that he     should not know of my intention as to the disposal of my property,     for it is better he should think that he will have to work for his     living; but at the same time there would be no harm in his knowing     that it is probable I shall help him on in life. This will make     him bear better what would otherwise be a dull visit. But I leave     this matter entirely in your hands. You know the boy and I do not,     and you can therefore better judge what will be best for him to     know. And now, dear Mary, if you will pardon my once again calling     you so,      \"I remain,      \"Your affectionate friend,      \"HERBERT PENFOLD.\"  It was characteristic of Mrs. Conway that at the first reading of this letter she thought rather of the writer than of the bright prospects which his offer opened to her son. She thought rather of Herbert Penfold, her first love, now ill, if not dying, of the days of their engagement and its rupture, than of the fact that her son was to inherit half the Penfold estates. She had been sorely hurt at the time; and even after all these years it was a pleasure to her to know that the quarrel was not as she had often thought at the time, a mere pretext for breaking off the engagement, but that Herbert had really loved her, had cared for her all these years, and had been the mysterious friend whose kindness had so lightened her cares.  \"I did not throw away my love after all,\" she said to herself, as with her eyes full of tears she stood at the window and looked out towards the sea. \"He cared for me enough to be faithful all this time and to think of me constantly, while I had almost forgotten the past. I ought to have known all the time that he was acting under the influence of others--those sisters of his, of course. I was always certain they hated me--hated the thought of my becoming mistress of Penfold Hall. I knew the influence they had over him. Herbert had no will of his own--it was the only fault I ever saw in him--and they could twist him round their little fingers. And now he is going to make Ralph his heir, or at least his heir with the girl he speaks of. It is a grand thing for Ralph; for the estates were worth, he told papa, eight thousand a year, and if Herbert's little romance comes off Ralph"]]]
