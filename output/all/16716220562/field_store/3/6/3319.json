Partners at dinner.  The guests at a house party.  Everyone at a small dinner or luncheon.  The four who are at the same bridge table.  Partners or fellow-players in any game.  At a dance, when an invitation has been asked for a stranger, the friend who vouched for him should personally present him to the hostess. \"Mrs. Worldly, this is Mr. Robinson, whom you said I might bring.\" The hostess shakes hands and smiles and says: \"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Robinson.\"  A guest in a box at the opera always introduces any gentleman who comes to speak to her, to her hostess, unless the latter is engrossed in conversation with a visitor of her own, or unless other people block the distance between so that an introduction would be forced and awkward.  A newly arriving visitor in a lady's drawing-room is not introduced to another who is taking leave. Nor is an animated conversation between two persons interrupted to introduce a third. Nor is any one ever led around a room and introduced right and left.  If two ladies or young girls are walking together and they meet a third who stops to speak to one of them, the other walks slowly on and does not stand awkwardly by and wait for an introduction. If the third is asked by the one she knows, to join them, the sauntering friend is overtaken and an introduction always made. The third, however, must not join them unless invited to do so.  At a very large dinner, people (excepting the gentlemen and ladies who are to sit next to each other at table) are not collectively introduced. After dinner, men in the smoking room or left at table always talk to their neighbors whether they have been introduced or not, and ladies in the drawing-room do the same. But unless they meet soon again, or have found each other so agreeable that they make an effort to continue the acquaintance, they become strangers again, equally whether they were introduced or not.  Some writers on etiquette speak of \"correct introductions\" that carry \"obligations of future acquaintance,\" and \"incorrect introductions,\" that seemingly obligate one to nothing.  Degrees of introduction are utterly unknown to best society. It makes not the slightest difference so far as any one's acceptance or rejection of another is concerned how an introduction is worded or, on occasions, whether an introduction takes place at all.  Fashionable people in very large cities take introductions lightly; they are veritable ships that pass in the night. They show their red or green signals--which are merely polite sentences and pleasant manners--and they pass on again.  When you are introduced to some one for the second time and the first occasion was without interest and long ago, there is no reason why you should speak of the former meeting.  If some one presents you to Mrs. Smith for the second time on the same occasion, you smile and say \"I have already met Mrs. Smith,\" but you say nothing if you met Mrs. Smith long ago and she showed no interest in you at that time.  Most rules are elastic and contract and expand according to circumstances. You do not remind Mrs. Smith of having met her before, but on meeting again any one who was brought to your own house, or one who showed you an especial courtesy you instinctively say, \"I am so glad to see you again.\"   =INCLUDING SOMEONE IN CONVERSATION WITHOUT AN INTRODUCTION=  On occasions it happens that in talking to one person you want to include another in your conversation without making an introduction. For instance: suppose you are talking to a seedsman and a friend joins you in your garden. You greet your friend, and then include her by saying, \"Mr. Smith is suggesting that I dig up these cannas and put in delphiniums.\" Whether your friend gives an opinion as to the change in color of your flower bed or not, she has been made part of your conversation.  This same maneuver of evading an introduction is also resorted to when you are not sure that an acquaintance will be agreeable to one or both of those whom an accidental circumstance has brought together.   =INTRODUCTIONS UNNECESSARY=  You must never introduce people to each other in public places unless you are certain beyond a doubt that the introduction will be agreeable to both. You cannot commit a greater social blunder than to introduce, to a person of position, some one she does not care to know, especially on shipboard, in hotels, or in other very small, rather public, communities where people are so closely thrown together that it is correspondingly difficult to avoid undesirable acquaintances who have been given the wedge of an introduction.  As said above, introductions in very large cities are unimportant. In New York, where people are meeting new faces daily, seldom seeing the same one twice in a year, it requires a tenacious memory to recognize those one hoped most to see again, and others are blotted out at once.  People in good society rarely ask to be introduced to each other, but if there is a good reason for knowing some one, they often introduce themselves; for instance, Mary Smith says:  \"Mrs. Jones, aren't you a friend of my mother's? I am Mrs. Titherington Smith's daughter.\" Mrs. Jones says:  \"Why, my dear child, I am so glad you spoke to me. Your mother and I have known each other since we were children!\"  Or, an elder lady asks: \"Aren't you Mary Smith? I have known your mother since she was your age.\" Or a young woman says: \"Aren't you Mrs. Worldly?\" Mrs. Worldly, looking rather freezingly, politely says \"Yes\" and waits. And the stranger continues, \"I think my sister Millicent Manners is a friend of yours.\" Mrs. Worldly at once unbends. \"Oh, yes, indeed, I am devoted to Millicent! And you must be ----?\"  \"I'm Alice.\"  \"Oh, of course, Millicent has often talked of you, and of your lovely voice. I want very much to hear you sing some time.\"  These self-introductions, however, must never presumingly be made. It would be in very bad taste for Alice to introduce herself to Mrs. Worldly if her sister knew her only slightly.   =A BUSINESS VISIT NOT AN INTRODUCTION=  A lady who goes to see another to get a reference for a servant, or to ask her aid in an organization for charity, would never consider such a meeting as an introduction, even though they talked for an hour. Nor would she offer to shake hands in leaving. On the other hand, neighbors who are continually meeting, gradually become accustomed to say \"How do you do?\" when they meet, even though they never become acquaintances.   =THE RETORT COURTEOUS TO ONE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN=  Let us suppose some one addresses you, and then slightly disconcerted says: \"You don't remember me, do you?\" The polite thing--unless his manner does not ring true, is to say \"Why, of course, I do.\" And then if a few neutral remarks lead to no enlightening topic, and bring no further memory, you ask at the first opportunity who it was that addressed you. If the person should prove actually to be unknown, it is very easy to repel any further advances. But nearly always you find it is some one you ought to have known, and your hiding the fact of your forgetfulness saves you from the rather rude and stupid situation of blankly declaring: \"I don't remember you.\"  If, after being introduced to you, Mr. Jones calls you by a wrong name, you let it pass, at first, but if he persists you may say: \"My name is Simpson, not Simpkin.\"  At a private dance, young men nowadays introduce their men friends to young women without first asking the latter's permission, because all those invited to a lady's house are supposed to be eligible for presentation to everyone, or they would not be there.  At a public ball young men and women keep very much to their own particular small circle and are not apt to meet outsiders at all. Under these circumstances a gentleman should be very careful not to introduce a youth whom he knows nothing about to a lady of his acquaintance--or at least he should ask her first. He can say frankly: \"There is a man called Sliders who has asked to meet you. I don't know who he is, but he seems decent. Shall I introduce him?\" The lady can say \"Yes\"; or, \"I'd rather not.\"   =INTRODUCTION BY LETTER=  An introduction by letter is far more binding than a casual spoken introduction which commits you to nothing. This is explained fully and example letters are given in the chapter on Letters.  A letter of introduction is handed you unsealed, always. It is correct for you to seal it at once in the presence of its author. You thank your friend for having written it and go on your journey.  If you are a man and your introduction is to a lady, you go to her house as soon as you arrive in her city, and leave the letter with your card at her door. Usually you do not ask to see her; but if it is between four and six o'clock it is quite correct to do so if you choose. Presenting yourself with a letter is always a little awkward. Most people prefer to leave their cards without asking to be received.  If your letter is to a man, you mail it to his house, unless the letter is a business one. In the latter case you go to his office, and send in your card and the letter. Meanwhile you wait in the reception room until he has read the letter and sends for you to come into his private office.  If you are a woman, you mail your letter of social introduction and do nothing further until you receive an acknowledgment. If the recipient of your letter leaves her card on you, you in return leave yours on her. But the obligation of a written introduction is such that only illness can excuse her not asking you to her house--either formally or informally.  When a man receives a letter introducing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],["title","Etiquette (#5)"],["body","man, he calls the person introduced on the telephone and asks how he may be of service to him. If he does not invite the newcomer to his house, he may put him up at his club, or have him take luncheon or dinner at a restaurant, as the circumstances seem to warrant.     CHAPTER III  GREETINGS   =WHAT TO SAY WHEN INTRODUCED=  As explained in the foregoing chapter, the correct formal greeting is: \"How do you do?\" If Mrs. Younger is presented to Mrs. Worldly, Mrs. Worldly says \"How do you do?\" If the Ambassador of France is presented to her, she says \"How do you do?\" Mrs. Younger and the Ambassador likewise say \"How do you do?\" or merely bow.  There are a few expressions possible under other circumstances and upon other occasions. If you have, through friends in common, long heard of a certain lady, or gentleman, and you know that she, or he, also has heard much of you, you may say when you are introduced to her: \"I am very glad to meet you,\" or \"I am delighted to meet you at last!\" Do not use the expression \"pleased to meet you\" then or on any occasion. And you must not say you are delighted unless you have reason to be sure that she also is delighted to meet you.  To one who has volunteered to help you in charitable work for instance, you would say: \"It is very good of you to help us,\" or, \"to join us.\"  In business a gentleman says: \"Very glad to meet you,\" or \"Delighted to meet you.\" Or, if in his own office: \"Very glad to see you!\"   =INFORMAL GREETINGS=  Informal greetings are almost as limited as formal, but not quite; for besides saying \"How do you do?\" you can say \"Good morning\" and on occasions \"How are you?\" or \"Good evening.\"  On very informal occasions, it is the present fashion to greet an intimate friend with \"Hello!\" This seemingly vulgar salutation is made acceptable by the tone in which it is said. To shout \"Hul_low_!\" is vulgar, but \"Hello, Mary\" or \"How 'do John,\" each spoken in an ordinary tone of voice, sound much the same. But remember that the \"Hello\" is spoken, not called out, and never used except between intimate friends who call each other by the first name.  There are only two forms of farewell: \"Good-by\" and \"Good night.\" Never say \"Au revoir\" unless you have been talking French, or are speaking to a French person. Never interlard your conversation with foreign words or phrases when you can possibly translate them into English; and the occasions when our mother tongue will not serve are extremely rare.  Very often in place of the over-worn \"How do you do,\" perhaps more often than not, people skip the words of actual greeting and plunge instead into conversation: \"Why, Mary! When did you get back?\" or \"What is the news with you?\" or \"What have you been doing lately?\" The weather, too, fills in with equal faithfulness. \"Isn't it a heavenly day!\" or \"Horrid weather, isn't it?\" It would seem that the variability of the weather was purposely devised to furnish mankind with unfailing material for conversation.  In bidding good-by to a new acquaintance with whom you have been talking, you shake hands and say, \"Good-by. I am very glad to have met you.\" To one who has been especially interesting, or who is somewhat of a personage you say: \"It has been a great pleasure to meet you.\" The other answers: \"Thank you.\"   =IN CHURCH=  People do not greet each other in church, except at a wedding. At weddings people do speak to friends sitting near them, but in a low tone of voice. It would be shocking to enter a church and hear a babel of voices!  Ordinarily in church if a friend happens to catch your eye, you smile, but never actually bow. If you go to a church not your own and a stranger offers you a seat in her pew, you should, on leaving, turn to her and say: \"Thank you.\" But you do not greet anyone until you are out on the church steps, when you naturally speak to your friends. \"Hello\" should not be said on this occasion because it is too \"familiar\" for the solemnity of church surroundings.   =SHAKING HANDS=  Gentlemen always shake hands when they are introduced to each other. Ladies rarely do so with gentlemen who are introduced to them; but they usually shake hands with other ladies, if they are standing near together. All people who know each other, unless merely passing by, shake hands when they meet.  A gentleman on the street never shakes hands with a lady without first removing his right glove. But at the opera, or at a ball, or if he is usher at a wedding, he keeps his glove on.   =PERSONALITY OF A HANDSHAKE=  A handshake often creates a feeling of liking or of irritation between two strangers. Who does not dislike a \"boneless\" hand extended as though it were a spray of sea-weed, or a miniature boiled pudding? It is equally annoying to have one's hand clutched aloft in grotesque affectation and shaken violently sideways, as though it were being used to clean a spot out of the atmosphere. What woman does not wince at the viselike grasp that cuts her rings into her flesh and temporarily paralyzes every finger?  The proper handshake is made briefly; but there should be a feeling of strength and warmth in the clasp, and, as in bowing, one should at the same time look into the countenance of the person whose hand one takes. In giving her hand to a foreigner, a married woman always relaxes her arm and fingers, as it is customary for him to lift her hand to his lips. But by a relaxed hand is not meant a wet rag; a hand should have life even though it be passive. A woman should always allow a man who is only an acquaintance to shake her hand; she should never shake his. To a very old friend she gives a much firmer clasp, but he shakes her hand more than she shakes his. Younger women usually shake the hand of the older; or they both merely clasp hands, give them a dropping movement rather than a shake, and let go.   =POLITE GREETINGS FROM YOUNGER TO OLDER=  It is the height of rudeness for young people not to go and shake hands with an older lady of their acquaintance when they meet her away from home, if she is a hostess to whose house they have often gone. It is not at all necessary for either young women or young men to linger and enter into a conversation, unless the older lady detains them, which she should not do beyond the briefest minute.  Older ladies who are always dragging young men up to unprepossessing partners, are studiously avoided and with reason; but otherwise it is inexcusable for any youth to fail in this small exaction of polite behavior. If a young man is talking with some one when an older lady enters the room, he bows formally from where he is, as it would be rude to leave a young girl standing alone while he went up to speak to Mrs. Worldly or Mrs. Toplofty. But a young girl passing near an older lady can easily stop for a moment, say \"How do you do, Mrs. Jones!\" and pass on.  People do not cross a room to speak to any one unless--to show politeness to an acquaintance who is a stranger there; to speak to an intimate friend; or to talk to some one about something in particular.     CHAPTER IV  SALUTATIONS OF COURTESY   =WHEN A GENTLEMAN TAKES OFF HIS HAT=  A gentleman takes off his hat and holds it in his hand when a lady enters the elevator in which he is a passenger, but he puts it on again in the corridor. A public corridor is like the street, but an elevator is suggestive of a room, and a gentleman does not keep his hat on in the presence of ladies in a house.  This is the rule in elevators in hotels, clubs and apartments. In office buildings and stores the elevator is considered as public a place as the corridor. What is more, the elevators in such business structures are usually so crowded that the only room for a man's hat is on his head. But even under these conditions a gentleman can reveal his innate respect for women by not permitting himself to be crowded too near to them.  When a gentleman stops to speak to a lady of his acquaintance in the street, he takes his hat off with his left hand, leaving his right free to shake hands, or he takes it off with his right and transfers it to his left. If he has a stick, he puts his stick in his left hand, takes off his hat with his right, transfers his hat also to his left hand, and gives her his right. If they walk ahead together, he at once puts his hat on; but while he is standing in the street talking to her, he should remain hatless. There is no rudeness greater than for him to stand talking to a lady with his hat on, and a cigar or cigarette in his mouth.  A gentleman always rises when a lady comes into a room. In public places men do not jump up for every strange woman who happens to approach. But if any woman addresses a remark to him, a gentleman at once rises to his feet as he answers her. In a restaurant, when a lady bows to him, a gentleman merely makes the gesture of rising by getting up half way from his chair and at the same time bowing. Then he sits down again.  When a lady goes to a gentleman's office on business he should stand up to receive her, offer her a chair, and not sit down until after she is seated. When she rises to leave, he must get up instantly and stand until she has left the office.  It is not necessary to add that every American citizen stands with his hat off at the passing of the \"colors\" and when the national anthem is played. If he didn't, some other more loyal citizen would take it off for him. Also every man should stand with his hat off in the presence of a funeral that passes close or blocks his way.   =A GENTLEMAN LIFTS HIS HAT=  Lifting the hat is a conventional gesture of politeness shown to strangers only, not to be confused with bowing, which is a gesture used to acquaintances and friends. In lifting his hat, a gentleman merely lifts it slightly off his forehead and replaces it; he does not smile nor bow, nor even look at the object of his courtesy. No gentleman ever subjects a lady to his scrutiny or his apparent observation.  If a lady drops her glove, a gentleman "]]]
