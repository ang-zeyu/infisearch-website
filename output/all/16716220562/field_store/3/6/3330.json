But as for you, ye know not how to act aright, unless it be to court the popular breeze, and win the empty applause of the multitude--nay, ye abandon the superlative worth of conscience and virtue, and ask a recompense from the poor words of others. Let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of this sort of arrogance. A certain man assailed one who had put on the name of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vain-glory, not for the practice of real virtue, and added: \"Now shall I know if thou art a philosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently.\" The other for awhile affected to be patient, and, having endured to be abused, cried out derisively: \"_Now_, do you see that I am a philosopher?\" The other, with biting sarcasm, retorted: \"I should have hadst thou held thy peace.\" Moreover, what concern have choice spirits--for it is of such men we speak, men who seek glory by virtue--what concern, I say, have these with fame after the dissolution of the body in death's last hour? For if men die wholly--which our reasonings forbid us to believe--there is no such thing as glory at all, since he to whom the glory is said to belong is altogether non-existent. But if the mind, conscious of its own rectitude, is released from its earthly prison, and seeks heaven in free flight, doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its deliverance from earthly bonds, and enters upon the joys of heaven?'    SONG VII.  GLORY MAY NOT LAST.       Oh, let him, who pants for glory's guerdon,       Deeming glory all in all,     Look and see how wide the heaven expandeth,       Earth's enclosing bounds how small!      Shame it is, if your proud-swelling glory       May not fill this narrow room!     Why, then, strive so vainly, oh, ye proud ones!       To escape your mortal doom?      Though your name, to distant regions bruited,       O'er the earth be widely spread,     Though full many a lofty-sounding title       On your house its lustre shed,      Death at all this pomp and glory spurneth       When his hour draweth nigh,     Shrouds alike th' exalted and the humble,       Levels lowest and most high.      Where are now the bones of stanch Fabricius?       Brutus, Cato--where are they?     Lingering fame, with a few graven letters,       Doth their empty name display.      But to know the great dead is not given       From a gilded name alone;     Nay, ye all alike must lie forgotten,       'Tis not _you_ that fame makes known.      Fondly do ye deem life's little hour       Lengthened by fame's mortal breath;     There but waits you--when this, too, is taken--       At the last a second death.    VIII.   'But that thou mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against Fortune, I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men well--I mean when she reveals herself, uncovers her face, and confesses her true character. Perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning. Strange is the thing I am trying to express, and for this cause I can scarce find words to make clear my thought. For truly I believe that Ill Fortune is of more use to men than Good Fortune. For Good Fortune, when she wears the guise of happiness, and most seems to caress, is always lying; Ill Fortune is always truthful, since, in changing, she shows her inconstancy. The one deceives, the other teaches; the one enchains the minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good, the other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of happiness. Accordingly, thou mayst see the one fickle, shifting as the breeze, and ever self-deceived; the other sober-minded, alert, and wary, by reason of the very discipline of adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by her allurements, draws men far from the true good; Ill Fortune ofttimes draws men back to true good with grappling-irons. Again, should it be esteemed a trifling boon, thinkest thou, that this cruel, this odious Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends--that other hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the false, but in departing she hath taken away _her_ friends, and left thee _thine_? What price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the fulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate? Cease, then, to seek the wealth thou hast lost, since in true friends thou hast found the most precious of all riches.'    SONG VIII.  LOVE IS LORD OF ALL.       Why are Nature's changes bound     To a fixed and ordered round?     What to leagu√®d peace hath bent     Every warring element?     Wherefore doth the rosy morn     Rise on Phoebus' car upborne?     Why should Phoebe rule the night,     Led by Hesper's guiding light?     What the power that doth restrain     In his place the restless main,     That within fixed bounds he keeps,     Nor o'er earth in deluge sweeps?     Love it is that holds the chains,     Love o'er sea and earth that reigns;     Love--whom else but sovereign Love?--     Love, high lord in heaven above!     Yet should he his care remit,     All that now so close is knit     In sweet love and holy peace,     Would no more from conflict cease,     But with strife's rude shock and jar     All the world's fair fabric mar.      Tribes and nations Love unites     By just treaty's sacred rites;     Wedlock's bonds he sanctifies     By affection's softest ties.     Love appointeth, as is due,     Faithful laws to comrades true--     Love, all-sovereign Love!--oh, then,     Ye are blest, ye sons of men,     If the love that rules the sky     In your hearts is throned on high!     BOOK III.  TRUE HAPPINESS AND FALSE.        SUMMARY       CH. I. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue. She promises to      lead him to true happiness.--CH. II. Happiness is the one end which      all created beings seek. They aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or      (_b_) rank, or (_c_) sovereignty, or (_d_) glory, or (_e_)      pleasure, because they think thereby to attain either (_a_)      contentment, (_b_) reverence, (_c_) power, (_d_) renown, or (_e_)      gladness of heart, in one or other of which they severally imagine      happiness to consist.--CH. III. Philosophy proceeds to consider      whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways, (_a_)      So far from bringing contentment, riches only add to men's      wants.--CH. IV. (_b_) High position cannot of itself win respect.      Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. They      even fall into contempt through lapse of time.--CH. V. (_c_)      Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety. History tells of the      downfall of kings and their ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their      lives. --CH. VI. (_d_) Fame conferred on the unworthy is but      disgrace. The splendour of noble birth is not a man's own, but his      ancestors'.--CH. VII. (_e_) Pleasure begins in the restlessness of      desire, and ends in repentance. Even the pure pleasures of home may      turn to gall and bitterness.--CH. VIII. All fail, then, to give      what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil      involved in each of these aims. Beauty and bodily strength are      likewise of little worth. In strength man is surpassed by the      brutes; beauty is but outward show.--CH. IX. The source of men's      error in following these phantoms of good is that _they break up      and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible_.      Contentment, power, reverence, renown, and joy are essentially      bound up one with the other, and, if they are to be attained at      all, must be attained _together_. True happiness, if it can be      found, will include them all. But it cannot be found among the      perishable things hitherto considered.--CH. X. Such a happiness      necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very happiness,      and in a manner, therefore, the happy man partakes also of the      Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since they      are all pursued only for the sake of good; it is _good_ which is      the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also happiness, it      is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same.--CH.      XI. Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, all things subsist so      long only as they preserve the unity of their being; when they lose      this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all things      (plants and inanimate things, as well as animals) to strive to      continue in life. Therefore, all things desire unity, for unity is      essential to life. But unity and goodness were shown to be the      same. Therefore, good is proved to be the end towards which the      whole universe tends.[E]--CH. XII. Boethius acknowledges that he is      but recollecting truths he once knew. Philosophy goes on to show      that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed.[F]      Boethius professes compunction for his former folly. But the      paradox of evil is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.   FOOTNOTES:  [E] This solves the second of the points left in doubt at the end of bk. i., ch. vi.  [F] This solves the third. No distinct account is given of the first, but an answer may be gathered from the general argument of bks. ii., iii., and iv.     BOOK III.    I.   She ceased, but I stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment and eager expectation, my ears still strained to listen. And then after a little I said: 'Thou sovereign solace of the stricken soul, what refreshment hast thou brought me, no less by the sweetness of thy singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse! Verily, I think not that I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of Fortune. Wherefore, I no longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe for my strength; nay, rather, I am eager to hear of them and call for them with all vehemence.'

For Collins was young, good-looking, and--knew it. Nature had gifted him with a susceptible heart and a fond eye for the beauties of femininity. So when he looked round and saw the woman threading her way through the maze of vehicles at \"Dead Man's Corner,\" with her skirt held up just enough to show two twinkling little feet in French shoes, and over them a graceful, willowy figure, and over that an enchanting, if rather too highly tinted face, with almond eyes and a fluff of shining hair under the screen of a big Parisian hat--that did for him on the spot.  He saw at a glance that she was French--exceedingly French--and he preferred English beauty, as a rule. But, French or English, beauty is beauty, and here undeniably was a perfect type, so he unhesitatingly sprang to her assistance and piloted her safely to the kerb, revelling in her voluble thanks, and tingling as she clung timidly but rather firmly to him.  \"Sair, I have to give you much gratitude,\" she said in a pretty, wistful sort of way, as they stepped on to the pavement. Then she dropped her hand from his sleeve, looked up at him, and shyly drooped her head, as if overcome with confusion and surprise at the youth and good looks of him. \"Ah, it is nowhere in the world but Londres one finds these delicate attentions, these splendid sergeants de ville,\" she added, with a sort of sigh. \"You are wonnerful--you are mos' wonnerful, you Anglais poliss. Sair, I am a stranger; I know not ze ways of this city of amazement, and if monsieur would so kindly direct me where to find the Abbey of the Ves'minster--\"  Before P.C. Collins could tell her that if that were her destination, she was a good deal out of her latitude; indeed, even before she concluded what she was saying, over the rumble of the traffic there rose a thin, shrill piping sound, which to ears trained to the call of it possessed a startling significance.  It was the shrilling of a police whistle, far off down the Embankment.  \"Hullo! That's a call to the man on point!\" exclaimed Collins, all alert at once. \"Excuse me, mum. See you presently. Something's up. One of my mates is a-signalling me.\"  \"Mates, monsieur? Mates? Signalling? I shall not understand the vords. But yes, vat shall that mean--eh?\"  \"Good Lord, don't bother me now! I--I mean, wait a bit. That's the call to 'head off' someone, and--By George! There he is now, coming head on, the hound, and running like the wind!\"  For of a sudden, through a break in the traffic, a scudding figure had sprung into sight--the figure of a man in a grey frock-coat and a shining \"topper,\" a well-groomed, well-set-up man, with a small, turned-up moustache and hair of that peculiar purplish-red one sees only on the shell of a roasted chestnut. As he swung into sight, the distant whistle shrilled again; far off in the distance voices sent up cries of \"Head him off!\" \"Stop that man!\" _et cetera_; then those on the pavement near to the fugitive took up the cry, joined in pursuit, and in a twinkling, what with cabmen, tram-men, draymen, and pedestrians shouting, there was hubbub enough for Hades.  \"A swell pickpocket, I'll lay my life,\" commented Collins, as he squared himself for an encounter and made ready to leap on the man when he came within gripping distance. \"Here! get out of the way, madmazelly. Business before pleasure. And, besides, you're like to get bowled over in the rush. Here, chauffeur!\"--this to the driver of a big, black motor-car which swept round the angle of the bridge at that moment, and made as though to scud down the Embankment into the thick of the chase--\"pull that thing up sharp! Stop where you are! Dead still. At once, at once, do you hear? We don't want you getting in the way. Now, then\"--nodding his head in the direction of the running man--\"come on you bounder; I'm ready for you!\"  And, as if he really heard that invitation, and really was eager to accept it, the red-headed man did \"come on\" with a vengeance. And all the time, \"madmazelly,\" unheeding Collins's advice, stood calmly and silently waiting.  Onward came the runner, with the whole roaring pack in his wake, dodging in and out among the vehicles, \"flooring\" people who got in his way, scudding, dodging, leaping, like a fox hard pressed by the hounds--until, all of a moment he spied a break in the traffic, leapt through it, and--then there was mischief. For Collins sprang at him like a cat, gripped two big, strong-as-iron hands on his shoulders, and had him tight and fast.  \"Got you, you ass!\" snapped he, with a short, crisp, self-satisfied laugh. \"None of your blessed squirming now. Keep still. You'll get out of your coffin, you bounder, as soon as out of my grip. Got you--got you! Do you understand?\"  The response to this fairly took the wind out of him.  \"Of course I do,\" said the captive, gaily; \"it's part of the programme that you should get me. Only, for Heaven's sake, don't spoil the film by remaining inactive, you goat! Struggle with me--handle me roughly--throw me about. Make it look real; make it look as though I actually did get away from you, not as though you let me. You chaps behind there, don't get in the way of the camera--it's in one of those cabs. Now, then, Bobby, don't be wooden! Struggle--struggle, you goat, and save the film!\"  \"Save the what?\" gasped Collins. \"Here! Good Lord! Do you mean to say--?\"  \"Struggle--struggle--struggle!\" cut in the man impatiently. \"Can't you grasp the situation? It's a put-up thing: the taking of a kinematograph film--a living picture--for the Alhambra to-night! Heavens above, Marguerite, didn't you tell him?\"  \"Non, non! There was not ze time. You come so quick, I could not. And he--ah, le bon Dieu!--he gif me no chance. Officair, I beg, I entreat of you, make it real! Struggle, fight, keep on ze constant move. Zere!\"--something tinkled on the pavement with the unmistakable sound of gold--\"zere, monsieur, zere is the half-sovereign to pay you for ze trouble, only, for ze lof of goodness, do not pick it up while the instrument--ze camera--he is going. It is ze kinematograph, and you would spoil everything!\"  The chop-fallen cry that Collins gave was lost in a roar of laughter from the pursuing crowd.  \"Struggle--struggle! Don't you hear, you idiot?\" broke in the red-headed man irritably. \"You are being devilishly well paid for it, so for goodness' sake make it look real. That's it! Bully boy! Now, once more to the right, then loosen your grip so that I can push you away and make a feint of punching you off. All ready there, Marguerite? Keep a clear space about her, gentlemen. Ready with the motor, chauffeur? All right. Now, then, Bobby, fall back, and mind your eye when I hit out, old chap. One, two, three--here goes!\"  With that he pushed the chop-fallen Collins from him, made a feint of punching his head as he reeled back, then sprang toward the spot where the Frenchwoman stood, and gave a finish to the adventure that was highly dramatic and decidedly theatrical. For \"mademoiselle,\" seeing him approach her, struck a pose, threw out her arms, gathered him into them--to the exceeding enjoyment of the laughing throng--then both looked back and behaved as people do on the stage when \"pursued,\" gesticulated extravagantly, and, rushing to the waiting motor, jumped into it.  \"Many thanks, Bobby; many thanks, everybody!\" sang out the red-headed man. \"Let her go, chauffeur. The camera men will pick us up again at Whitehall, in a few minutes' time.\"  \"Right you are, sir,\" responded the chauffeur gaily. Then \"toot-toot\" went the motor-horn as the gentleman in grey closed the door upon himself and his companion, and the vehicle, darting forward, sped down the Embankment in the exact direction whence the man himself had originally come, and, passing directly through that belated portion of the hurrying crowd to whom the end of the adventure was not yet known, flew on and--vanished.  And Collins, stooping to pick up the half-sovereign that had been thrown him, felt that after all it was a poor price to receive for all the jeers and gibes of the assembled onlookers.  \"Smart capture, Bobby, wasn't it?\" sang out a deriding voice that set the crowd jeering anew. \"You'll git promoted, you will! See it in all the evenin' papers--oh, yus! ''Orrible hand-to-hand struggle with a desperado. Brave constable has 'arf a quid's worth out of an infuriated ruffin!' My hat! won't your missis be proud when you take her to see that bloomin' film?\"  \"Move on, now, move on!\" said Collins, recovering his dignity, and asserting it with a vim. \"Look here, cabby, I don't take it kind of you to laugh like that; they had you just as bad as they had me. Blow that Frenchy! She might have tipped me off before I made such an ass of myself. I don't say that I'd have done it so natural if I had known, but--Hullo! What's that? Blowed if it ain't that blessed whistle again, and another crowd a-pelting this way; and--no!--yes, by Jupiter!--a couple of Scotland Yard chaps with 'em. My hat! what do you suppose that means?\"  He knew in the next moment. Panting and puffing, a crowd at their heels, and people from all sides stringing out from the pavement and trooping after them, the two \"plain-clothes\" men came racing through the grinning gathering and bore down on P.C. Collins.  \"Hullo, Smathers, you in this, too?\" began he, his feelings softened by the knowledge that other arms of the law would figure on that film with him at the Alhambra to-night. \"Now, what are you after, you goat?"]]]
