People travel from all parts of the world to climb these mountains and to see the wonderful scenery.  \"Maybe it's here we are to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" said the Villain, \"and not at the North Pole at all.\"  \"Oh, I hope so,\" said Sweetclover.  It was getting very cold now, for you know that the higher you go up in the air, the colder it gets. That's why there's snow on the mountain tops. And it began to storm; at first tiny flakes of snow fell, and then faster and thicker till it was snowing very hard, and the pigeons could scarcely see where they were flying.  \"It seems to me,\" said the Villain, \"that every time I get upon a boat or a bird or anything, it begins to storm.\"  By this time it was really a blizzard and one by one the poor pigeons' wings became so covered with snow they could not fly and fell to the ground and lay on the snow.  Of course they fell in different places, and Kernel Cob and Jackie Tar and Sweetclover and the Villain were separated.  Each one looked about for the others as best he could and, after much searching about, the Villain found Sweetclover huddled in the snow and very cold indeed. So he pulled off his coat and wrapped it about her shoulders, although she tried her best to prevent him from making such a sacrifice, but he said:  \"I will certainly suffer more seeing you shiver, than I would from the cold itself.\"  You see he was a kind-hearted Villain, and it was too bad that he was painted to look like one at all.  So he dug a hole in a snowbank and they crawled into it, and in that way they were shielded from the wind.  Night came on and Kernel Cob and Jackie Tar searched about, but it was so dark that they could not tell where they were going, but only went round and round in circles.  In the morning the snow stopped falling, and if it hadn't been so cold it would have been a very beautiful sight. Snow lay all about them as far as the eye could reach.  [Illustration]  You must know that in the Alps mountains, where they were, there are dogs, and very wonderful dogs they are, who live in the snowy mountains and are trained to go about to find lost travellers and to help them.  And one of these dogs came sniffing along and the first thing he did was to find the Villain, and you can imagine his and Sweetclover's delight when they saw him.  Around his neck was a little knapsack, and this he told them to untie and they would find food and a roll of fine warm wool inside.  And putting the wool about them they were soon warm as toast.  \"Let us try to find Kernel Cob and Jackie Tar before they die of the cold,\" said the Villain.  \"Very well,\" said Saint Bernard, for that was the name of the dog, \"Come with me and we'll soon find them.\"  So he asked them to climb upon his back and he trotted off, and pretty soon they came to a spot where Jackie Tar's head was sticking up out of the snow. In a jiffy they had him out and sitting on the Dog's back.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted the Villain, \"now for Kernel Cob.\"  In less than a minute they came to a little mound of snow.  So the Dog trotted up to it, and round on the other side they discovered an opening like a door, and inside lay Kernel Cob asleep, snoring away like anything.  So they wakened him and he was glad to see them, you may be sure.  And he climbed upon the Dog's back and all four rode off.  \"Where are you going?\" he asked them.  \"We were on our way to the North Pole when our pigeons died,\" explained Jackie Tar.  \"I'd like to take you there, if I could,\" said the Dog, \"but I can't leave my work here. But I'll take you to the foot of the mountains, and there I'll have you meet a friend of mine who will take you to a ship going to the North Pole.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" said Sweetclover. \"We shall never be able to pay you for your kindness.\"  \"Thank you, Miss,\" said the Dog. \"I'm sure it will make me very happy to know that I helped you.\"  And when they arrived at the foot of the mountain he introduced them to his friend, a French poodle named Pierre, and when it was come time to say good-bye, he gave them each his paw and the last they saw of him was his bushy tail wagging behind him, as he trotted up the snowy mountain where he did so much good.  [Illustration]          I love dogs best of all God's creatures,         They have such noble, honest features,         You never really have to scold 'em         Because they do just what you've told 'em.          And even dogs that have no beauty         Are always quick to do their duty,         For they are faithful friends, and true,         And gladly give their lives for you.     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XIX   \"Well,\" said their new friend Pierre, \"That was a bad storm.\"  \"We would have been lost in the snow, if it had not been for your good friend Saint Bernard,\" said Sweetclover.  And Pierre took them to a seaport and put them on a sailing vessel which is called a whaler.  \"I have heard that this ship makes many voyages to the North,\" said Pierre, \"And I'm sure that it will take you where you want to go.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said Sweetclover, \"and we shall always remember how good you have been to us.\"  \"It is a pleasure to be of service to you,\" said Pierre.  And they said good-bye to him and went aboard the whaler.  The next morning the vessel set sail amid great cheering from a crowd which had gathered on the dock, and for days they sailed and sailed, and it got colder and colder till the vessel came to great fields of ice.  But the dolls were happy, for they thought they were getting close to the North Pole and soon they would find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather.  \"Do you think you will know them when you see them?\" asked Jackie Tar.  \"I'm sure of it,\" answered Kernel Cob, \"for I remember just the way they looked in the glass ball that the Magician showed us in India.\"  And one night as they were sailing along, the dolls crept out on the deck to see where they might be, for all the time they were on the ship they were down in the hold to be out of sight.  And they sat on a coil of rope but could see nothing except the great wide sea and the beautiful blue sky.  And they fell asleep.  But the vessel began to rock and, waking, they saw that a storm had risen.  \"Quick,\" said the Villain, \"we must get down out of danger, for if we sit here we shall be swept overboard.\"  But Kernel Cob who loved all sorts of adventures didn't want to go.  \"I love to be in danger,\" said he.  \"That's not sensible,\" said Sweetclover. \"There is enough danger in the world without looking for more of it. Come, let us go.\"  And the storm grew worse and worse, and the vessel was rolling and it was with great difficulty that they could stand.  And now something very sad was about to happen, something I would like not to tell you, but it really happened, so I must.  As Sweetclover stood up to move she slipped and fell upon the deck and would have rolled overboard if the Villain hadn't caught her, but alas! his generous action brought about his own misfortune for the vessel lurched at that moment and he was carried down to the side and before he could regain his balance he was swept overboard.  There was no time to stand there, for nothing could be done and sadly Kernel Cob lifted Sweetclover and carried her below.  [Illustration]  Let us not dwell upon the sadness of our poor little friends, but let us feel sure that no matter how long they live and no matter where they go, they will always remember this good, true, unselfish friend who was willing to lose his own life to save another's.         *       *       *       *       *  And at length the vessel stuck in the ice and that was as far as they could go. Kernel Cob put his head out of the window of the vessel, which is called a port-hole, and saw nothing but ice, great fields of ice, greenish white and it was bitter cold. But Sweetclover had found some strips of woolen cloth on the ship which Jackie Tar had torn and tied about them to keep them warm, for sailors, you know, are very handy because they have no women about to help them to sew their clothes and cannot be running to the stores to buy things.  [Illustration]                       VILLAINS          A Villain must be very horrid         To wear a frown upon his forehead         And lead a wicked pirate crew         To do the awful things they do.          It's quite as easy to be good         And kind to all, as children should,         For grown-ups never give you toys         If you are naughty girls and boys.          Besides, if you do what is right         Your mother kisses you at night,         And who could sleep in peaceful bliss         Without a mother's good-night kiss?     [Illustration]  CHAPTER XX   And Jackie Tar had found a little compass on the ship, and this he had put in his pocket, for said he:  \"You can never tell when you may be lost around the North Pole.\"  So they went ashore and, after Jackie had taken his bearings with his compass to see which way to go, they set out to walk to the North Pole.  And after they had walked for hours and hours, they saw a little bear, which is called a cub.  \"I wonder if he is a tame bear,\" said Sweetclover.  And Kernel Cob went up to him as brave as you please and put out his hand to the bear and said:  \"Hello, Teddy!\" but the bear growled and showed his teeth.  \"Don't start anything like that,\" said Kernel Cob, \"unless you want to get hurt.\"  \"Well, don't you call me names,\" said the Cub.  \"Who's calling you names?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"You are,\" said the Cub.  \"What name did I call you?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"Would you like to be called after a make-believe bear if you were a real one?\" asked the Cub.  \"No, I guess not,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"Well then,\" said the Cub.  \"Excuse me,\" said Kernel Cob, for he liked to see anybody who had spunk.  And they shook hands and were friends at once.  \"Who are you?\" asked the Cub, \"and what are you doing up here?\"  \"I'm Kernel Cob,\" said he, \"and this is Sweetclover and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14114"],["title","Plutarch's Lives, Volume 2 (of 4) (#0)"],["body","PLUTARCH'S LIVES  TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK, WITH NOTES AND A LIFE OF PLUTARCH  BY  AUBREY STEWART, M.A.  _Late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge_  AND THE LATE  GEORGE LONG, M.A.  _Formerly Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge_  IN FOUR VOLUMES  VOL.

Cato the elder, speaking to some persons who were praising a man of reckless daring and audacity in war, observed that there is a difference between a man's setting a high value on courage, and setting a low value on his own life--and rightly. For a daring soldier in the army of Antigonus, but of broken and ill health, being asked by the king the reason of his paleness, confessed that he was suffering from some secret disorder. When then the king, anxious for him, charged his physicians to use the greatest care in their treatment, if a cure were possible, at length this brave fellow, being restored to health, was no longer fond of peril and furious in battle, so that Antigonus reproved him, and expressed surprise at the change. The man made no secret of his reason, but answered: \"My, king, you have made me less warlike by freeing me from those miseries on account of which I used to hold my life cheap.\" And the Sybarite seems to have spoken to the same effect about the Spartans, when he said that \"they do no great thing by dying in the wars in order to escape from such labours and such a mode of life as theirs.\" However, no wonder if the Sybarites, effete with luxurious debauchery, thought men mad who despised death for love of honour and noble emulation; whereas the Lacedæmonians were enabled by their valour both to live and to die with pleasure, as the elegy shows, which runs thus:      \"'Twas not that life or death itself was good,     That these heroic spirits shed their blood:     This was their aim, and this their latest cry,     'Let us preserve our honour, live or die.'\"  For neither is avoidance of death blameable, if a man does not cling to his life from dishonourable motives; nor is exposure to peril honourable, if it springs from carelessness of life. For this reason Homer always brings the most daring and warlike heroes into battle well and beautifully armed, and the Greek lawgivers punish the man who throws away his shield, but not him who throws away his sword or spear, showing that it is each man's duty to take more care that he does not receive hurt himself, than to hurt the enemy, especially if he be the chief of an army or city.  II. For if, as Iphikrates defined it, the light troops resemble the hands, the cavalry the feet, the main body the breast and trunk, and the general the head, then it would appear that he, if he runs into danger and shows personal daring, risks not only his own life, but that of all those whose safety depends upon him; and _vice versâ_. Wherefore Kallikratidas, although otherwise a great man, yet did not make a good answer to the soothsayer; for when he begged him to beware of death, which was presaged by the sacrifices, he replied that Sparta had more men besides himself. No doubt, in fighting either by sea or land[1] Kallikratidas only counted for one, but as a general, he combined in his own person the strength of all the rest, so that he by whose death so many perished, was indeed more than one. A better answer was that of old Antigonus, who, as he was about to begin a sea-fight off Andros, some one having said that the enemy's fleet was the more numerous, asked, \"And for how many do you count _me_?\"--setting a high value, as is due, upon a skilful and brave leader, whose first duty is to keep safe him who preserves all the rest.  So Timotheus said well, when Chares was displaying to the Athenians the wounds on his body, and his shield pierced by a dart. \"Now I,\" said he, \"when I was besieging Samos, was quite ashamed if an arrow fell near me, thinking that I was exposing myself more boyishly than was fitting for the general and leader of so important a force.\" In cases where the personal risk of the general is of great moment to his army, then he must fight and expose himself without stint, and disregard those who say that a general should die of old age, or at any rate, when an old man. But where the gain is small in case of success, while failure ruins everything, no one demands that the work of the common soldier be performed at the risk of the general's life.  These prefatory remarks occurred to me in writing the Lives of Pelopidas and Marcellus, great men who fell in a manner scarce worthy of themselves: for being both of them most stout in battle, and having each illustrated his country by splendid campaigns, against, too, the most terrible antagonists--the one, as we read, having routed Hannibal, who before was invincible, and the other having in a pitched battle conquered the Lacedæmonians, the ruling state by sea and land--yet they without any consideration endangered themselves and flung away their lives just at the time when there was special need for such men to live and command. And on this account I have drawn a parallel between their lives, tracing out the points of resemblance between them.  III. The family of Pelopidas, the son of Hippokles, was an honourable one at Thebes, as likewise was that of Epameinondas. Bred in great affluence, and having early succeeded to a splendid inheritance, he showed eagerness to relieve the deserving poor, that he might prove that he had become the master, not the servant of his riches. In most cases, Aristotle observes, men either do not use their wealth through narrow-mindedness, or else abuse it through extravagance, and the one class are always the slaves of their pleasures, the other of their gains.  Now, while all other persons gratefully made use of Pelopidas's liberality and kindness, Epameinondas alone could not be induced to share his wealth; he thereupon shared the other's poverty, priding himself on simplicity of dress and plainness of food, endurance of fatigue, and thoroughness in the performance of military service; like Kapaneus, in Euripides, who \"had plenty of wealth, but was far from proud on account of his wealth,\" for he felt ashamed to be seen using more bodily luxuries than the poorest Theban citizen. Epameinondas, whose poverty was hereditary, made it lighter and more easily borne by the practice of philosophy, and by choosing from the beginning a single life; while Pelopidas made a brilliant marriage and had children born to him, yet, in spite of this, diminished his fortune by disregard of money-making and by giving up all his time to the service of his country. And when his friends blamed him, and said that he was treating lightly a necessary of life, the possession of money, \"Necessary, indeed,\" he answered, \"for Nikodemus here,\" pointing to a man who was a cripple and blind.  IV. They were both alike in nobleness of spirit, save that Pelopidas took more pleasure in bodily exercise, and Epameinondas in learning, and that the one in his leisure time frequented the palæstra and the hunting field, while the other would listen to and discuss philosophy. And though they have both many titles to glory, yet judicious persons think nothing so much to their credit as that their friendship should have remained from beginning to end unimpaired through so many important crises, campaigns, and administrations. For any one who considers the administrations of Aristeides and Themistokles, and Kimon and Perikles, and Nikias and Alkibiades, how full they were of mutual enmity, distrust, and jealousy, and then contrasts them with the kindness and respect shown by Pelopidas to Epameinondas, will pronounce with truth these men to have really been colleagues in government and war rather than those who were constantly struggling to get the better of one another instead of the enemy. The true cause of this was their virtue, guided by which they sought no glory or gain for themselves from their deeds, from which envious rivalry always results, but both, inflamed by a noble desire to see their country reach its climax of power and renown in their own time, used one another's successes for this purpose as if they were their own. Not but what most people think that their closest friendship arose from the campaign of Mantinea, which they made with a contingent sent from Thebes to serve with the Lacedæmonians, who were then their friends and allies. Stationed together in the ranks,[2] and fighting against the Arcadians, when the wing of the Lacedæmonian army in which they were gave way, and many took to flight, they closed up together and beat off their assailants. Pelopidas, having received seven wounds in front, fell down upon a heap of slain, friends and enemies together; but Epameinondas, though he thought him desperately[3] hurt, ran forward and stood in defence of his body and arms, risking his life alone against a multitude, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. He too was in evil plight, with a spear wound in the breast, and "]]]
