And she would resign herself to her fate, nothing loath to be drawn close to his side, or to a seat upon his knee, to be petted and caressed like a child, which, indeed, he persisted in calling her.  This was when they were alone: but very frequently they had company to spend the day, afternoon, or evening; for Ion had always been noted for its hospitality; and scarcely a week passed in which they did not pay a visit to the Oaks, the Laurels, the Pines, or Roselands.  Also a brisk correspondence was carried on with the absent members of the family. And Zoe's housekeeping cares and duties were just enough to be an agreeable variety in her occupations: every day, too, when the weather permitted, she walked or rode out with her husband.  And so the time passed quite delightfully for the first two months after the departure of the Viamede party.  It was a disappointment that Edward found himself too busy to make the hoped-for trip to Viamede at Christmas-time; yet Zoe did not fret over it, and really enjoyed the holidays extremely, giving and receiving numerous handsome presents, and, with Edward's assistance, making it a merry and happy time for the servants and other dependants, as well as for the relatives and friends still in the neighborhood.  The necessary shopping, with Edward to help her, and the packing and sending off of the Christmas-boxes to Viamede, to the college-boys,--Herbert and Harold,--and numerous other relatives and friends far and near, Zoe thought altogether the most delightful business she had ever taken in hand.  A very merry, happy little woman she was through all those weeks and months, Edward as devoted as any lover, and as gay and light-hearted as herself.  \"Zoe, darling,\" Edward said one day at dinner, \"I must drive over into our little village of Union--by the way, do you know that we have more than a hundred towns of that name in these United States?\"  \"No, I did not know, or suspect, that we had nearly so many,\" she interrupted, laughing: \"no wonder letters go astray when people are not particular to give the names of both county and State. But what were you going to say about driving over there?\"  \"I must see a gentleman on business, who will be there to meet the five-o'clock train, and leave on it; and, in order to be certain of seeing him, I must be there at least fifteen or twenty minutes before it is due. Shall I have the pleasure of my wife's company in the carriage? I have ordered it to be at the door by fifteen or twenty minutes past four, which will give us plenty of time, as it is an easy matter to drive from here to Union in ten minutes.\"  \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I accept the invitation with pleasure, and promise to be ready at the minute.\"  \"You are the best little woman about that,\" he returned, with an appreciative look and smile. \"I don't remember that you have ever yet kept me waiting, when told beforehand at what time I intended to start.\"  \"Of course not,\" she said, with a pleased laugh; \"because I was afraid, if I did, I shouldn't be invited so often: and I'm always so glad to go with you.\"  \"Not gladder than I am to have you,\" he said, with a very lover-like glance and smile. \"I always enjoy your society, and am always proud to show my friends and acquaintances what a dear little wife I have. I dare say I'm looked upon as a very fortunate fellow in that respect, and sometimes envied on account of having drawn such a prize in the matrimonial lottery.\"  They had left the table while he spoke, and with the last words he passed his arm round her waist.  \"Dear me, Ned, what a gallant speech!\" she said, flushing with delight; \"you deserve a reward:\" and she held up her face for a kiss.  \"I am overpaid,\" he said, when he had bestowed it.  \"In spite of the coin being such as you have a right to help yourself to whenever you will?\" she returned with a merry laugh. \"O Ned, my lover-husband!\" she added, laying her head on his breast, \"I am so happy in belonging to you, and I can never love you enough for all your goodness to me!\"  \"Darling, are you not equally good and loving to me?\" he asked in tender tones, and holding her close.  \"But I owe every thing to you,\" she responded with emotion. \"If you had not come to my aid when my dear father was taken from me, what would have become of me, a mere child, without a near relative in the world, alone and destitute in a foreign land?\"  \"But I loved you, dearest. I sought my own happiness, as well as yours, in asking you to be my wife. So you need never feel burdened by the idea that you are under any special obligation to me, to whom you are the very sunshine of life.\"  \"Dear Ned, how very kind in you to say so,\" she responded, gazing with ardent affection into his eyes; \"but it isn't burdensome to be under obligation to you, any more than it is a trial to be ruled by you,\" she added, with playful tenderness; \"and I love to think of all your goodness to me.\"  It was five minutes past four by Zoe's watch, and she just about to go to her dressing-room to put on her hat and cloak, when visitors were announced,--some ladies who always made a lengthened call at Ion; so she at once resigned herself to the loss of her anticipated drive with her husband.  \"O Ned!\" she whispered in a hasty, vexed aside, \"you'll have to go alone.\"  \"Yes, dear,\" he returned; \"but I'll try to get back in time to take you a drive in the other direction.\"  They stepped forward, and greeted their guests with hospitable cordiality.  They were friends whose visits were prized and enjoyed, though their coming just at this time was causing Zoe a real disappointment. However, Edward's promise of a drive with him at a later hour so far made amends for it, that she could truthfully express pleasure in seeing her guests.  Edward chatted with them for a few moments, then, excusing himself on the plea of business that could not be deferred, left them to be entertained by Zoe, while he entered his waiting carriage, and went on his way to the village, where he expected to meet his business acquaintance.     CHAPTER II.  \"The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness.\"--SHAKSPEARE.   Edward had met and held his desired interview with his business acquaintance, seen him aboard his train, and was standing watching it as it steamed away and disappeared in the distance, when a feminine voice, close at hand, suddenly accosted him.  \"O Mr. Travilla! how are you? I consider myself very fortunate in finding you here.\"  He turned toward the speaker, and was not too greatly pleased at sight of her.  \"Ah! good-evening, Miss Deane,\" he said, taking her offered hand, and speaking with gentlemanly courtesy. \"In what can I be of service to you?\"  \"By inviting me to Ion to spend the night,\" she returned laughingly. \"I've missed my train, and was quite in despair at the thought of staying alone over night in one of the miserable little hotels of this miserable little village. So I was delighted to see your carriage standing there, and you yourself beside it; for, knowing you to be one of the most hospitable of men, I am sure you will be moved to pity, and take me home with you.\"  Edward's heart sank at thought of Zoe, but, seeing no way out of the dilemma, \"Certainly,\" he said, and helped his self-invited guest to a seat in his carriage, placed himself by her side, and bade the coachman drive on to Ion.  \"Now, really, this is very good in you, Mr. Travilla,\" remarked Miss Deane: \"there is no place I like better to visit than Ion, and I begin to think it was rather a fortunate mishap--missing my train.\"  \"Very unfortunate for me, I fear,\" sighed Edward to himself. \"The loss of her drive will be a great disappointment to Zoe, and the sight of such a guest far from making it up to her. I am thankful the visit is to be for only a night.\"  Aloud he said, \"I fear you will find it less pleasant than on former occasions,--in fact, rather lonely; as all the family are absent--spending the winter at Viamede, my mother's Louisiana plantation--except my wife and myself.\"  \"Ah! but your wife is a charming little girl,--I never can think of her as a woman, you know,--and you are a host in yourself,\" returned the lady laughingly.  Zoe's callers had left; and she, having donned hat and cloak, not to keep her husband a single moment, was at the window watching for his coming, when the carriage came driving up the avenue, and drew up at the door.  She hurried out, expecting to find no one there but himself, and to be at once handed to a seat in the vehicle, and the next minute be speeding away with him, enjoying her drive all the more for the little disappointment that had preceded it.  What, then, was her chagrin to see a visitor handed out, and that visitor the woman for whom she had conceived the most violent antipathy!  \"Miss Deane, my dear,\" Edward said, with an entreating look at Zoe, which she did not see, her eyes being at that instant fixed upon the face of her uninvited and unwelcome guest.  \"How do you do, my dear Mrs. Travilla? I hope you are glad to see me?\" laughed the intruder, holding out a delicately gloved hand, \"your husband has played the Good Samaritan to me to-night--saving me from having to stay in one of those wretched little hotels in the village till two o'clock to-morrow morning.\"  \"I am in usual health, thank you. Will you walk in?\" returned Zoe in a freezing tone, and utterly ignoring the offered hand. \"Will you step into the parlor? or would you prefer being shown to your room first?\"  \"The latter, if you please,\" Miss Deane answered sweetly, apparently quite unaware that Zoe's manner was in the least ungracious.  \"Dinah,\" said Zoe, to a maid-in-waiting, \"show Miss Deane to the room she occupied on her last visit. Carry up her satchel, and see that she has every thing she wants.\"  Having given the order, Zoe stepped out to the veranda where"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14488"],["title","Elsie's Kith and Kin (#2)"],["body","still was, having staid behind to give directions in regard to the horses.  \"Zoe, love, I am very sorry,\" he said, as the man turned his horses' heads, and drove away toward the stables.  \"O Edward! how could you?\" she exclaimed reproachfully, tears of disappointment and vexation springing to her eyes.  \"Darling, I really could not help it,\" he replied soothingly, drawing her to him with a caress, and went on to tell exactly what had occurred.  \"She is not a real lady,\" said Zoe, \"or she never would have done a thing like that.\"  \"I agree with you, love,\" he said; \"but I was sorry your reception of her was so extremely ungracious and cold.\"  \"Would you have had me play the hypocrite, Ned?\" she asked indignantly.  \"No, Zoe, I should be very far from approving of that,\" he answered gravely: \"but while it was right and truthful not to express pleasure which you did not feel, at her coming, you might, on the other hand, have avoided absolute rudeness; you might have shaken hands with her, and asked after her health and that of her father's family.\"  \"I treated her as well as she deserved; and it does not make her any the more welcome to me, that she has already been the means of drawing down upon me a reproof from my husband's lips,\" Zoe said in tremulous tones, and turning away from him with her eyes full of tears.  \"My words were hardly intended as that, little wife,\" Edward responded in a kindly tone, following her into the hall, catching her in his arms, and imprinting a kiss on her ruby lips.  \"And I wanted my drive with you so badly,\" she murmured, half hiding her face on his breast; \"but she has robbed us of that, and--O Ned! is she to come between us again, and make us quarrel, and be so dreadfully unhappy?\" Her voice was full of tears and sobs before she had ended.  \"No, no; I could not endure that any more than you,\" he said with emotion, and clasping her very close: \"and it is only for to-night you will have to bear the annoyance of her presence; she is to leave in the morning.\"  \"Is she? that is some comfort. I hope somebody will come in for the evening, and share with us the infliction of her society,\" Zoe said, concluding with a forlorn attempt at a laugh.  \"Won't you take off that very becoming hat and cloak, Mrs. Travilla, and spend the evening?\" asked Edward playfully.  \"Thank you. I believe I will, if you will accompany me to the dressing-room,\" she returned, with a smiling look up into his face.  \"That I will with pleasure,\" he said, \"provided you will reward me with some assistance with my toilet.\"  \"Such as brushing your hair, and tying your cravat? Yes, sir, I will: it's a bargain.\"  And so, laughing and chatting, they went up to their own private apartments.  Halt an hour later they came down again together, to find Miss Deane in the parlor, seated by a window overlooking the avenue.  \"There's a carriage just drawing up before your front entrance,\" she remarked: \"the Roselands family carriage, I think it is.\"  Zoe gave her husband a bright, pleased look. It seemed her wish for an addition to their party for the evening had been granted.  The next moment the room-door was thrown, open, and Dr. Conly and Miss Ella were announced.  They were cordially welcomed, asked to tea, and staid the evening, greatly relieving Zoe in the matter of entertaining her unwelcome guest, who devoted herself to the doctor, and left Edward to his wife and cousin, a condition of things decidedly agreeable to Zoe.  A little after nine the Roselands carriage was announced; and the doctor and Ella took their departure, Edward and Zoe accompanying them to the outer door.  The sky was black with clouds, and the wind roaring through the trees on the lawn.  \"We are going to have a heavy storm. I think,\" remarked Arthur, glancing upward: \"there is not a star to be seen, and the wind blows almost a gale. I hope no patient of mine will want the doctor very badly to-night,\" he added with a slight laugh. \"Step in out of the wind, cousin Zoe, or you may be the very one to send for me.\"  Doing as directed, \"No, indeed,\" she said: \"I'm sure I couldn't have the heart to call anybody up out of a warm bed to face such a cutting wind as this.\"  \"No, no; never hesitate when there is a real necessity,\" he returned, speaking from his seat in the carriage, where he had already taken his place beside his sister, whom Edward had handed in. \"Good-night, and hurry in, both of you, for my sake if not for your own.\"  But they lingered a moment till the carriage turned, and drove swiftly down the avenue.  \"I am so glad they came,\" remarked Zoe, as Edward shut the door and locked it for the night.  \"Yes,\" he said: \"they added a good deal to the pleasure of the evening. As we couldn't be alone together, three guests were more acceptable than one.\"  \"Decidedly; and that one was delighted, I'm sure, to have an opportunity to exercise her conversational gifts for the benefit of a single man instead of a married one.\"  \"Zoe, love, don't allow yourself to grow bitter and sarcastic,\" Edward said, turning toward her, laying a hand lightly, affectionately, upon her shoulder, and gazing down into her eyes with a look of grave concern.  She colored under it, and turned away with a pout that almost spoiled the beauty of her fair face. She was more than ever impatient to be rid of their self-invited guest.  \"She always sets Ned to scolding me,\" was the bitter thought in her heart as she went slowly back to the parlor, where they had left Miss Deane, Edward following, sighing inwardly at the change in his darling always wrought by that unwelcome presence in the house.  \"How the wind roars down the chimney!\" Miss Deane remarked as her host and hostess re-entered the room, where she was comfortably seated in an easy-chair beside the glowing grate. \"I fear to-morrow will prove a stormy day; but in that case I shall feel all the more delighted with my comfortable quarters here,--all the more grateful to you, Mr. Travilla, for saving me from a long detention in one of those miserable little country taverns, where I should have died of _ennui_.\"  \"You seem kindly disposed, my dear madam, to make a great deal of a small service,\" returned Edward gallantly.  But Zoe said not a word. She stood gazing into the fire, apparently lost in thought; but the color deepened on her cheek, and a slight frown contracted her brows.  Presently she turned to her guest, saying courteously, \"You must be weary with your journey, Miss Deane: would you like to retire?\"  \"Thank you, I should,\" was the reply; and thereupon the good-nights were said, and they sought their respective rooms.  \"You are not displeased with me, dear?\" Zoe asked, lifting her eyes inquiringly to her husband's face as she stood before their dressing-room fire with his arm about her waist: \"you are looking so very grave.\"  \"No, dearest, I am not disposed to find fault with you,\" he said, softly caressing her hair and cheek with his disengaged hand; \"though I should be glad if you could be a trifle more cordial to our uninvited guest.\"  \"It's my nature to act just as I feel; and, if there's a creature on earth I thoroughly detest, it is she!\" returned the child-wife with almost passionate vehemence. \"I know she hates me,--for all her purring manner and sweet tones and words,--and that she likes nothing better than to make trouble between my husband and me.\"  \"My dear child, you really must try not to be so uncharitable and suspicious,\" Edward said in a slightly reproving tone. \"I do not perceive any such designs or any hypocrisy in her conduct toward you.\"  \"No: men are as blind as a bat in their intercourse with such women; never can see through their designs; always take them to be as sweet and amiable as they pretend to be. It takes a woman to understand her own sex.\"  \"Maybe so,\" he said soothingly; \"but we will leave the disagreeable subject for to-night at least, shall we not?\"  \"Yes; and, oh, I do hope the weather to-morrow will not be such as to afford her an excuse for prolonging her stay!\"  \"I hope not, indeed, love,\" he responded; \"but let us resolve, that, if it does, we will try to bear the infliction patiently, and give our self-invited guest no right to accuse us of a lack of hospitality toward her. Let us not forget or disobey the Bible injunction, to 'use hospitality one to another without grudging.'\"  \"I'll try not to. I'll be as good to her as I can, without feeling that I am acting insincerely.\"  \"And that is all I ask, love. Your perfect freedom from any thing approaching to deceit is one of your greatest charms, in your husband's eyes,\" he said, tenderly caressing her. \"It would, I am sure, be quite impossible for me to love a wife in whose absolute truth and sincerity I had not entire confidence.\"  \"And you do love me, your foolish, faulty little wife?\" she said, in a tone that was a mixture of assertion and inquiry, while her lovely eyes gazed searchingly into his.  \"Dearly, dearly, my sweet!\" he said, smiling fondly down upon her. \"And now to bed, lest these bright eyes and rosy cheeks should lose something of their brilliance and beauty.\"  \"Suppose they should,\" she said, turning slightly pale, as with sudden pain. \"O Ned! if I live, I must some day grow old and gray and wrinkled, my eyes dim and sunken: shall you love me then, darling?\"  \"Better than ever, love,\" he whispered, holding her closer to his heart; \"for how long we shall have lived and loved together! We shall have come to be as one indeed, each with hardly a thought or feeling unshared by the other.\"     CHAPTER III.  \"One woman reads another's character, without the tedious trouble of deciphering.\"--JONSON.   Zoe's sleep that night was profound and refreshing, and she woke in perfect health and vigor of body and mind; but the first sound that smote upon her ear--the dashing of sleet against the window-pane--sent a pang of disappointment and dismay to her heart.  She sprang from her bed, and, running to the window, drew aside "]]]
