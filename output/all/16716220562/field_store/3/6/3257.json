To him who truly understands this     truth hath come great knowledge.\"--The Kybalion.  How often have the majority of people heard repeated the statement that their Deity (called by many names) was \"All in All\" and how little have they suspected the inner occult truth concealed by these carelessly uttered words? The commonly used expression is a survival of the ancient Hermetic Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: \"To him who truly understands this truth, hath come great knowledge.\" And, this being so, let us seek this truth, the understanding of which means so much. In this statement of truth--this Hermetic Maxim--is concealed one of the greatest philosophical, scientific and religious truths.  We have given you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental Nature of the Universe--the truth that \"the Universe is Mental--held in the Mind of THE ALL.\" As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: \"All is in THE ALL.\" But note also the co-related statement, that: \"It is equally true that THE ALL is in ALL.\" This apparently contradictory statement is reconcilable under the Law of Paradox. It is, moreover, an exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and its Mental Universe. We have seen how \"All is in THE ALL\"--now let us examine the other aspect of the subject.  The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in (\"remaining within; inherent; abiding within\") its Universe, and in every part, particle, unit, or combination, within the Universe. This statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the Principle of Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to form a Mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental form, the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming an idea of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student will find that while the image has its existence, and being, solely within his own mind, yet he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life, spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the \"immanent mind\" of the thinker. Consider this for a moment, until the idea is grasped.  To take a modern example, let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear, Richard III, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of their conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed within each of these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and action. Whose is the \"spirit\" of the characters that we know as Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah Heep--is it Dickens, or have each of these characters a personal spirit, independent of their creator? Have the Venus of Medici, the Sistine Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and reality of their own, or do they represent the spiritual and mental power of their creators? The Law of Paradox explains that both propositions are true, viewed from the proper viewpoints. Micawber is both Micawber, and yet Dickens. And, again, while Micawber may be said to be Dickens, yet Dickens is not identical with Micawber. Man, like Micawber, may exclaim: \"The Spirit of my Creator is inherent within me-- and yet I am not HE!\" How different this from the shocking half-truth so vociferously announced by certain of the half-wise, who fill the air with their raucous cries of: \"I am God!\" Imagine poor Micawber, or the sneaky Uriah Heep, crying: \"I Am Dickens\"; or some of the lowly clods in one of Shakespeare's plays, eloquently announcing that: \"I Am Shakespeare!\" THE ALL is in the earthworm, and yet the earth-worm is far from being THE ALL. And still the wonder remains, that though the earth-worm exists merely as a lowly thing, created and having its being solely within the Mind of THE ALL--yet THE ALL is immanent in the earthworm, and in the particles that go to make up the earth-worm. Can there be any greater mystery than this of \"All in THE ALL; and THE ALL in All?\"  The student will, of course, realize that the illustrations given above are necessarily imperfect and inadequate, for they represent the creation of mental images in finite minds, while the Universe is a creation of Infinite Mind--and the difference between the two poles separates them. And yet it is merely a matter of degree--the same Principle is in operation--the Principle of Correspondence manifests in each--\"As above, so Below; as Below, so above.\"  And, in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling Spirit immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale of life. This is what spiritual development means--the recognition, realization, and manifestation of the Spirit within us. Try to remember this last definition--that of spiritual development. It contains the Truth of True Religion.  There are many planes of Being--many sub-planes of Life--many degrees of existence in the Universe. And all depend upon the advancement of beings in the scale, of which scale the lowest point is the grossest matter, the highest being separated only by the thinnest division from the SPIRIT of THE ALL. And, upward and onward along this Scale of Life, everything is moving. All are on the Path, whose end is THE ALL. All progress is a Returning Home. All is Upward and Onward, in spite of all seemingly contradictory appearances. Such is the message of the Illumined.  The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental Creation of the Universe, are that at the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL, in its aspect of Being, projects its Will toward its aspect of \"Becoming\" and the process of creation begins. It is taught that the process consists of the lowering of Vibration until a very low degree of vibratory energy is reached, at which point the grossest possible form of Matter is manifested. This process is called the stage of Involution, in which THE ALL becomes \"involved,\" or \"wrapped up,\" in its creation. This process is believed by the Hermetists to have a Correspondence to the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so wrapped up in his mental creation as to almost forget his own existence and who, for the time being, almost \"lives in his creation,\" If instead of \"wrapped\" we use the word \"rapt,\" perhaps we will give a better idea of what is meant.  This Involuntary stage of Creation is sometimes called the \"Outpouring\" of the Divine Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is called the \"Indrawing.\" The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of the pendulum of Rhythm--a \"coming home\" idea being held in all of the Hermetic Teachings.  The Teachings are that during the \"Outpouring,\" the vibrations become lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing begins. But there is this difference, that while in the \"Outpouring\" the creative forces manifest compactly and as a whole, yet from the beginning of the Evolutionary or \"Indrawing\" stage, there is manifested the Law of Individualization--that is, the tendency to separate into Units of Force, so that finally that which left THE ALL as unindividualized energy returns to its source as countless highly developed Units of Life, having risen higher and higher in the scale by means of Physical, Mental and Spiritual Evolution.  The ancient Hermetists use the word \"Meditation\" in describing the process of the mental creation of the Universe in the Mind of THE ALL, the word \"Contemplation\" also being frequently employed. But the idea intended seems to be that of the employment of the Divine Attention. \"Attention\" is a word derived from the Latin root, meaning \"to reach out; to stretch out,\" and so the act of Attention is really a mental \"reaching out; extension\" of mental energy, so that the underlying idea is readily understood when we examine into the real meaning of \"Attention.\"  The Hermetic Teachings regarding the process of Evolution are that, THE ALL, having meditated upon the beginning of the Creation--having thus established the material foundations of the Universe--having thought it into existence--then gradually awakens or rouses from its Meditation and in so doing starts into manifestation the process of Evolution, on the material mental and spiritual planes, successively and in order. Thus the upward movement begins--and all begins to move Spiritward. Matter becomes less gross; the Units spring into being; the combinations begin to form; Life appears and manifests in higher and higher forms; and Mind becomes more and more in evidence--the vibrations constantly becoming higher. In short, the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases, begins, and proceeds according to the established \"Laws of the Indrawing\" process. All of this occupies aeons upon aeons of Man's time, each aeon containing countless millions of years, but yet the Illumined inform us that the entire creation, including Involution and Evolution, of an Universe, is but \"as the twinkle of the eye\" to THE ALL.  At the end of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE ALL withdraws its Attention--its Contemplation and Meditation--of the Universe, for the Great Work is finished--and All is withdrawn into THE ALL from which it emerged. But Mystery of Mysteries--the Spirit of each soul is not annihilated, but is infinitely expanded--the Created and the Creator are merged. Such is the report of the Illumined!  The above illustration of the \"meditation,\" and subsequent \"awakening from meditation,\" of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the teachers to describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet: \"As Below, so Above.\" The difference is merely in degree.

The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry is very interesting in itself. It is also a pregnant example of the contrast between the scientific and the emotional methods of regarding nature; and it admirably illustrates the differences between well-grounded, suggestive, hypotheses, and baseless speculations.  I have tried to tell the story so that it may be intelligible to the ordinary reader.                                               M.M. PATTISON MUIR.

For thousands of years before men had any accurate and exact knowledge of the changes of material things, they had thought about these changes, regarded them as revelations of spiritual truths, built on them theories of things in heaven and earth (and a good many things in neither), and used them in manufactures, arts, and handicrafts, especially in one very curious manufacture wherein not the thousandth fragment of a grain of the finished article was ever produced.  The accurate and systematic study of the changes which material things undergo is called chemistry; we may, perhaps, describe alchemy as the superficial, and what may be called subjective, examination of these changes, and the speculative systems, and imaginary arts and manufactures, founded on that examination.  We are assured by many old writers that Adam was the first alchemist, and we are told by one of the initiated that Adam was created on the sixth day, being the 15th of March, of the first year of the world; certainly alchemy had a long life, for chemistry did not begin until about the middle of the 18th century.  No branch of science has had so long a period of incubation as chemistry. There must be some extraordinary difficulty in the way of disentangling the steps of those changes wherein substances of one kind are produced from substances totally unlike them. To inquire how those of acute intellects and much learning regarded such occurrences in the times when man's outlook on the world was very different from what it is now, ought to be interesting, and the results of that inquiry must surely be instructive.  If the reader turns to a modern book on chemistry (for instance, _The Story of the Chemical Elements_, in this series), he will find, at first, superficial descriptions of special instances of those occurrences which are the subject of the chemist's study; he will learn that only certain parts of such events are dealt with in chemistry; more accurate descriptions will then be given of changes which occur in nature, or can be produced by altering the ordinary conditions, and the reader will be taught to see certain points of likeness between these changes; he will be shown how to disentangle chemical occurrences, to find their similarities and differences; and, gradually, he will feel his way to general statements, which are more or less rigorous and accurate expressions of what holds good in a large number of chemical processes; finally, he will discover that some generalisations have been made which are exact and completely accurate descriptions applicable to every case of chemical change.  But if we turn to the writings of the alchemists, we are in a different world. There is nothing even remotely resembling what one finds in a modern book on chemistry.  Here are a few quotations from alchemical writings [1]:     [1] Most of the quotations from alchemical writings, in this    book, are taken from a series of translations, published in    1893-94, under the supervision of Mr A.E. Waite.     \"It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to   draw out its soul.... Copper is like a man; it has a soul and a   body ... the soul is the most subtile part ... that is to say, the   tinctorial spirit. The body is the ponderable, material,   terrestrial thing, endowed with a shadow.... After a series of   suitable treatments copper becomes without shadow and better than   gold.... The elements grow and are transmuted, because it is their   qualities, not their substances which are contrary.\" (Stephanus of   Alexandria, about 620 A.D.)    \"If we would elicit our Medecine from the precious metals, we must   destroy the particular metalic form, without impairing its   specific properties. The specific properties of the metal have   their abode in its spiritual part, which resides in homogeneous   water. Thus we must destroy the particular form of gold, and   change it into its generic homogeneous water, in which the spirit   of gold is preserved; this spirit afterwards restores the   consistency of its water, and brings forth a new form (after the   necessary putrefaction) a thousand times more perfect than the   form of gold which it lost by being reincrudated.\" (Philalethes,   17th century.)    \"The bodily nature of things is a concealing outward vesture.\"   (Michael Sendivogius, 17th century.)    \"Nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance, but   in the virtue ... the less there is of body, the more in   proportion is the virtue.\" (Paracelsus, 16th century.)    \"There are four elements, and each has at its centre another   element which makes it what it is. These are the four pillars of   the world.... It is their contrary action which keeps up the   harmony and equilibrium of the mundane machinery.\" (Michael   Sendivogius.)    \"Nature cannot work till it has been supplied with a material: the   first matter is furnished by God, the second matter by the sage.\"   (Michael Sendivogius.)    \""]]]
