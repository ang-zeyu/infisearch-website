Garfield (#6)"],["body"," yourself away if you became a sailor?\"  Mrs. Garfield, who had listened with deep interest to the remarks of the young man, regarded James anxiously, to see what effect these arguments were having upon him. She did not fear disobedience. She knew that if she should make it a personal request, James was dutiful enough to follow her wishes; but she respected the personal independence of her children, and wanted to convince, rather than to coerce, them.  \"If I knew positively that you were right in your estimate of me, Mr. Bates, I would go in for a course of study.\"  \"Consult some one in whose judgment you have confidence, James,\" said the teacher, promptly.  \"Can you suggest any one?\" asked the boy.  \"Yes, Dr. J.P. Robinson, of Bedford, is visiting at the house of President Hayden, of Hiram College. You have heard of him?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"He is a man of ripe judgment, and you can rely implicitly on what he says.\"  \"As soon as I am well enough I will do as you advise,\" said James.  \"Then I am satisfied. I am sure the doctor will confirm my advice.\"  \"Mr. Bates,\" said Mrs. Garfield, as she followed out the young teacher, \"I am much indebted to you for your advice to James. It is in accordance with my wishes. If he should decide to obtain an education, where would you advise him to go?\"  \"To the seminary where I have obtained all the education I possess,\" answered the young man.  \"Where is it?\"  \"It is called the 'Geauga Seminary,' and is located in Chester, in the next county. For a time it will be sufficient to meet all James' needs. When he is further advanced he can go to Hiram College.\"  \"Is it expensive?\" asked Mrs. Garfield. \"James has no money except the few dollars his brother and I can spare him.\"  \"He will have plenty of company. Most of the students are poor, but there are chances of finding work in the neighborhood, and so earning a little money. James knows something of the carpenter's trade?\"  \"Yes, he helped build the house we live in, and he has been employed on several barns.\"  My readers will remember that the Garfields no longer lived in the humble log-cabin in which we first found them. The money Thomas brought home from Michigan, supplemented by the labor of James and himself, had replaced it by a neat frame house, which was much more comfortable and sightly.  \"That will do. I think I know a man who will give him employment.\"  \"He is a boy of energy. If he gets fairly started at school, I think he will maintain himself there,\" said Mrs. Garfield.  The teacher took his leave.  When Mrs. Garfield re-entered the room she found James looking very thoughtful.  \"Mother,\" he said, abruptly, \"I want to get well as quick as I can. I am sixteen years old, and it is time I decided what to do with myself.\"  \"You will think of what Mr. Bates has said, will you not?\"  \"Yes, mother; as soon as I am well enough I will call on Dr. Robinson and ask his candid opinion. I will be guided by what he says.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  GEAUGA SEMINARY.   I have stated in a previous chapter that James became acquainted with Dr. Robinson while still employed on the canal. This statement was made on the authority of Mr. Philo Chamberlain, of Cleveland, who was part proprietor of the line of canal-boats on which the boy was employed. Edmund Kirke, however, conveys the impression that James was a stranger to the doctor at the time he called upon him after his sickness. Mr. Kirke's information having been derived chiefly from General Garfield himself, I shall adopt his version, as confirmed by Dr. Robinson.  When James walked up to the residence of President Hayden, and inquired for Dr. Robinson, he was decidedly homespun in appearance. He probably was dressed in his best, but his best was shabby enough. His trousers were of coarse satinet, and might have fitted him a season or two before, but now were far outgrown, reaching only half-way down from the tops of his cowhide boots. His waistcoat also was much too short, and his coat was threadbare, the sleeves being so short as to display a considerable portion of his arms. Add to these a coarse slouched hat, much the worse for wear, and a heavy mass of yellow hair much too long, and we can easily understand what the good doctor said of him: \"He was wonderfully awkward, but had a sort of independent, go-as-you-please manner that impressed me favorably.\"  \"Who are you?\" asked the doctor.  \"My name is James Garfield, from Solon.\"  \"Oh, I know your mother, and knew you when you were a babe, but you have outgrown my knowledge. I am glad to see you.\"  \"I should like to see you alone,\" said James.  The doctor led the way to a secluded spot in the neighborhood of the house, and then, sitting down on a log, the youth, after a little hesitation, opened his business.  \"You are a physician,\" he said, \"and know the fiber that is in men. Examine me and tell me with the utmost frankness whether I had better take a course of liberal study. I am contemplating doing so, as my desire is in that direction. But if I am to make a failure of it, or practically so, I do not desire to begin. If you advise me not to do so I shall be content.\"  In speaking of this incident the doctor has remarked recently: \"I felt that I was on my sacred honor, and the young man looked as though he felt himself on trial. I had had considerable experience as a physician, but here was a case much different from any I had ever had. I felt that it must be handled with great care. I examined his head and saw that there was a magnificent brain there. I sounded his lungs, and found that they were strong, and capable of making good blood. I felt his pulse, and felt that there was an engine capable of sending the blood up to the head to feed the brain. I had seen many strong physical systems with warm feet and cold, sluggish brain; and those who possessed such systems would simply sit round and doze. Therefore I was anxious to know about the kind of an engine to run that delicate machine, the brain. At the end of a fifteen minutes' careful examination of this kind, we rose, and I said:  \"Go on, follow the leadings of your ambition, and ever after I am your friend. You have the brain of a Webster, and you have the physical proportions that will back you in the most herculean efforts. All you need to do is to work; work hard, do not be afraid of over-working and you will make your mark.\"  It will be easily understood that these words from a man whom he held in high respect were enough to fix the resolution of James. If he were really so well fitted for the work and the career which his mother desired him to follow, it was surely his duty to make use of the talents which he had just discovered were his.  After that there was no more question about going to sea. He deliberately decided to become a scholar, and then follow where Providence led the way.  He would have liked a new suit of clothes, but this was out of the question. All the money he had at command was the seventeen dollars which his mother had offered him. He must get along with this sum, and so with hopeful heart he set out for Geauga Seminary.  He did not go alone. On hearing of his determination, two boys, one a cousin, made up their minds to accompany him.  Possibly my young readers may imagine the scene of leave-taking, as the stage drove up to the door, and the boys with their trunks or valises were taken on board, but if so, imagination would picture a scene far different from the reality. Their outfit was of quite a different kind.  For the sake of economy the boys were to board themselves, and Mrs. Garfield with provident heart supplied James with a frying-pan, and a few necessary dishes, so that his body might not suffer while his mind was being fed. Such was the luxury that awaited James in his new home. I am afraid that the hearts of many of my young readers would sink within them if they thought that they must buy an education at such a cost as that. But let them not forget that this homespun boy, with his poor array of frying-pan and dishes, was years after to strive in legislative halls, and win the highest post in the gift of his fellow-citizens. And none of these things would have been his, in all likelihood, but for his early struggle with poverty.  So far as I know, neither of his companions was any better off than James. All three were young adventurers traveling into the domains of science with hopeful hearts and fresh courage, not altogether ignorant of the hardships that awaited them, but prepared to work hard for the prizes of knowledge.  Arrived at Geauga Seminary, they called upon the principal and announced for what purpose they had come.  \"Well, young men, I hope you mean to work?\" he said.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered James promptly. \"I am poor, and I want to get an education as quick as I can.\"  \"I like your sentiments, and I will help you as far as I can.\"  The boys succeeded in hiring a room in an old unpainted building near the academy for a small weekly sum. It was unfurnished, but they succeeded in borrowing a few dilapidated chairs from a neighbor who did not require them, and some straw ticks, which they spread upon the floor for sleeping purposes. In one corner they stowe their frying-pans, kettles, and dishes, and then they set up housekeeping in humble style.  The Geauga Seminary was a Freewill Baptist institution, and was attended by a considerable number of students, to whom it did not, indeed, furnish what is called \"the higher education,\" but it was a considerable advance upon any school that James had hitherto attended. English grammar, natural philosophy, arithmetic, and algebra--these were the principal studies to which James devoted himself, and they opened to him new fields of thought. Probably it was at this humble seminary that he first acquired the thirst for learning that ever afterward characterized him.  Let us look in upon the three boys a night or two after they have commenced housekeeping.  They take turns in cooking, and this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14964"],["title","From Canal Boy to President; Or, the Boyhood and Manhood of James A. Garfield (#7)"],["body","it is the turn of the one in whom we feel the strongest interest.  \"What have we got for supper, boys?\" he asks, for the procuring of supplies has fallen to them.  \"Here are a dozen eggs,\" said Henry Bounton, his cousin.  \"And here is a loaf of bread, which I got at the baker's,\" said his friend.  \"That's good! We'll have bread and fried eggs. There is nothing better than that.\"  \"Eggs have gone up a cent a dozen,\" remarks Henry, gravely.  This news is received seriously, for a cent means something to them. Probably even then the price was not greater than six to eight cents a dozen, for prices were low in the West at that time.  \"Then we can't have them so often,\" said James, philosophically, \"unless we get something to do.\"  \"There's a carpenter's-shop a little way down the street,\" said Henry. \"I guess you can find employment there.\"  \"I'll go round there after supper.\"  Meanwhile he attended to his duty as cook, and in due time each of the boys was supplied with four fried eggs and as much bread as he cared for. Probably butter was dispensed with, as too costly a luxury, until more prosperous times.  When supper was over the boys took a walk, and then, returning to their humble room, spent the evening in preparing their next morning's lessons.  In them James soon took leading rank, for his brain was larger, and his powers of application and intuition great, as Dr. Robinson had implied. From the time he entered Geauga Seminary probably he never seriously doubted that he had entered upon the right path.     CHAPTER IX.  WAYS AND MEANS.   James called on the carpenter after supper and inquired if he could supply him with work.  \"I may be able to if you are competent,\" was the reply. \"Have you ever worked at the business?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where?\"  \"At Orange, where my home is.\"  \"How long did you work at it?\"  \"Perhaps I had better tell you what I have done,\" said James.  He then gave an account of the barns he had been employed upon, and the frame house which he had assisted to build for his mother.  \"I don't set up for a first-class workman,\" he added, with a smile, \"but I think I can be of some use to you.\"  \"I will try you, for I am rather pressed with work just now.\"  So, in a day or two James was set to work.  The carpenter found that it was as he had represented. He was not a first-class workman. Indeed, he had only a rudimentary knowledge of the trade, but he was quick to learn, and in a short time he was able to help in many ways. His wages were not very large, but they were satisfactory, since they enabled him to pay his expenses and keep his head above water. Before the seventeen dollars were exhausted, he had earned quite a sum by his labor in the carpenter's-shop.  About this time he received a letter from his brother.  \"Dear James,\" he wrote, \"I shall be glad to hear how you are getting along. You took so little money with you that you may need more. If so, let me know, and I will try to send you some.\"  James answered promptly: \"Don't feel anxious about me, Thomas. I have been fortunate enough to secure work at a carpenter's-shop, and my expenses of living are very small. I intend not to call upon you or mother again, but to pay my own way, if I keep my health.\"  He kept his word, and from that time did not find it necessary to call either upon his mother or his good brother, who was prepared to make personal sacrifices, as he had been doing all his life, that his younger brother might enjoy advantages which he had to do without.  At length the summer vacation came. James had worked hard and won high rank in his respective studies. He had a robust frame, and he seemed never to get tired. No doubt he took especial interest in composition and the exercises of the debating society which flourished at Geauga, as at most seminaries of advanced education. In after-life he was so ready and powerful in debate, that we can readily understand that he must have begun early to try his powers. Many a trained speaker has first come to a consciousness of his strength in a lyceum of boys, pitted against some school-fellow of equal attainments. No doubt many crude and some ludicrous speeches are made by boys in their teens, but at least they learn to think on their feet, and acquire the ability to stand the gaze of an audience without discomposure. A certain easy facility of expression also is gained, which enables them to acquit themselves creditably on a more important stage.  James early learned that the best preparation for a good speech is a thorough familiarity with the subject, and in his after-life he always carefully prepared himself, so that he was a forcible debater, whom it was not easy to meet and conquer.  \"He once told me how he prepared his speeches,\" said Representative Williams, of Wisconsin, since his death. \"First he filled himself with the subject, massing all the facts and principles involved, so far as he could; then he took pen and paper and wrote down the salient points in what he regarded their logical order. Then he scanned these critically, and fixed them in his memory. 'And then,' said he, 'I leave the paper in my room and trust to the emergency.'\"  When the vacation came James began to look about for work. He could not afford to be idle. Moreover, he hoped to be able to earn enough that he might not go back empty-handed in the fall.  Generally work comes to him who earnestly seeks it, and James heard of a man who wanted some wood cut.  He waited upon this man and questioned him about it.  \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I want the wood cut. What will you charge to do it?\"  \"How much is there?\"  \"About a hundred cords.\"  James thought of the time when he cut twenty-five cords for seven dollars, and he named a price to correspond.  \"I'll give you twenty-five dollars,\" said the proprietor of the wood.  It was a low price for the labor involved, but, on the other hand, it would be of essential service to the struggling student.  \"I will undertake it,\" he said.  \"When will you go to work?\"  \"Now!\" answered James promptly.  How long it took him to do the work we have no record, but he doubtless worked steadfastly till it was accomplished. We can imagine the satisfaction he felt when the money was put into his hands, and he felt that he would not need to be quite so economical in the coming term.  Accordingly, when the vacation was over and James went back to the seminary, he did not re-engage the room which he and his two friends had rented the term before. He realized that to be in a condition to study well he must feed his body well, and he was in favor of a more generous system of diet. Besides, the labor required for cooking was so much time taken from his study hours.  He heard that a widow--Mrs. Stiles--mother of the present sheriff of Ashtabula County, was prepared to receive boarders, and, accordingly, he called upon her to ascertain if she would receive him.  She knew something of him already, for she learned that he had obtained the reputation of a steady and orderly student, and was disposed to favor his application.  The next question was an important one to young Garfield.  \"How much do you expect me to pay?\"  He waited with some anxiety for the answer, for though he had twenty-five dollars in his pocket, the term was a long one, and tuition was to be paid also.  \"A dollar and six cents will be about right,\" said Mrs. Stiles, \"for board, washing, and lodging.\"  \"That will be satisfactory,\" said James, with a sigh of relief, for he saw his way clear to pay this sum for a time, at least, and for the whole term if he could again procure employment at his old trade.  A dollar and six cents! It was rather an odd sum, and we should consider it nowadays as very low for any sort of board in any village, however obscure or humble. But in those days it was not so exceptional, and provisions were so much lower that the widow probably lost nothing by her boarder, though she certainly could not have made much.  James had no money to spare for another purpose, though there was need enough of it. He needed some new clothes badly. He had neither underclothing nor overcoat, and but one outside suit, of cheap Kentucky jean. No doubt he was subjected to mortification on account of his slender supply of clothing. At any rate he was once placed in embarrassing circumstances.  Toward the close of the term, as Mrs. Stiles says, his trowsers became exceedingly thin at the knees, and one unlucky day, when he was incautiously bending forward, they tore half-way round the leg, exposing his bare knee.  James was very much mortified, and repaired damages as well as he could with a pin.  \"I need a new suit of clothes badly,\" he said in the evening, \"but I can't afford to buy one. See how I have torn my trowsers.\"  \"Oh, that is easy enough to mend,\" said Mrs. Stiles, cheerfully.  \"But I have no other pair to wear while they are being mended,\" said James, with a blush.  \"Then you must go to bed early, and send them down by one of the boys. I will darn the hole so that you will never know it. You won't mind such trifles when you become President.\"  It was a jocose remark, and the good lady little dreamed that, in after years, the young man with but one pair of pantaloons, and those more than half worn, would occupy the proud position she referred to.     CHAPTER X.  A COUSIN'S REMINISCENCES.   During his school-life at Geauga Seminary James enjoyed the companionship of a cousin, Henry B. Boynton, who still lives on the farm adjoining the one on which our hero was born. The relationship between the two boys was much closer than is common between cousins; for while their mothers were sisters, their fathers were half-brothers. Henry was two years older than James, and they were more like brothers than cousins. I am sure my young readers will be glad to read what Henry has to say of their joint school-life. I quote from the account of an interview held with a correspondent of the Boston _Herald_, bearing the date of"]]]
