When my performance was over, the second victim, Edgar Doe, with the steel calm of a French aristocrat, which he affected under punishment, walked to the spot where I had been operated on. He bent over (again without being told to do so), and only spoiled his proud submission by telegraphing to Radley one uncontrolled look of pathetic appeal like the glance of a faithful dog. Radley, not noticing these unnerving actions, or possibly a little annoyed by them, administered justice severely enough for Doe, proud as he was, to wince slightly at every cut. Then he put his cane away, and issued, as before, his little ration of gentleness.  \"You're two plucky boys,\" he said.   §4  That night I measured my barefoot height against the dormitory wall, and made a deep pencil-mark thereon: which done, I reached up to a great height, and made a mark to represent Radley. After these preliminaries there was nothing to do but to wait developments. One practice which aided growth was to lie full-length in bed instead of curled up. So, after I had cut with nail-scissors the few fair hairs from my breast and calves, in an endeavour to encourage a plentiful crop like that which added manliness to Pennybet's darker form--after this delicate, operation, I got between the sheets, and straightened out my limbs with a considerable effort of the will. Later on I forced them down again, when I found that my knees had once more strayed up to my chin.  Our dormitory at Bramhall House was a long many-windowed room, containing thirty beds, Edgar Doe's being on my left. He suddenly made reference to our punishment of the morning.  \"I wonder why he gave me a worse dose than you.\"  \"Yes, he did let into you,\" I said cheerfully.  Doe flushed, and continued talking so as to be heard only by me.  \"If it had been any other master, I'd have been mad with him. Fancy, practically two whackings in a morning; one on the knuckles and one on the--and the other. But you can't hate Radley, can you?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" I said, with grave doubts.  There was a pause. But a desire to tell confidences had been begotten of warm bed and darkness, and my friend soon proceeded:  \"It's funny, Rupert, but I like talking to you better than to any of the other chaps. I feel I can tell you things I wouldn't tell anybody else. Do you know, I really think I like Radley better than anyone else in the world. I simply loved being whacked by him.\"  I pulled the clothes off my head that I might see the extraordinary creature that was talking to me. A dim light always burned near our beds, and by it I was able to see that Doe was very red and clearly wishing he had not made his last remark. My immediate desire, on witnessing his discomfiture, was to put him at his ease by pretending that I saw nothing unusual in the words. So I quickly evolved a very casual question.  \"What! Better than your father and mother?\"  \"Well, you see--\" and he shifted uneasily--\"you know perfectly well that my father and mother are dead.\"  \"O law!\" I said.  Awkwardly the conversation dropped. And, as I lay upon my pillow, down went my brain along a line of wandering thoughts. Doe's remark, I reflected, was like that of a school-girl who adored her mistress. Perhaps Doe was a girl. After all, I had no certain knowledge that he wasn't a girl with his hair cut short. I pictured him, then, with his hair, paler than straw, reaching down beneath his shoulders, and with his brown eyes and parted lips wearing a feminine appearance. As I produced this strange figure, I began to feel, somewhere in the region of my waist, motions of calf-love for the girl Doe that I had created. But, as Doe's prowess at cricket asserted itself upon my mind, his gender became conclusively established, and--ah, well, I was half asleep.  But, so strange were the processes of my childish mind that this feeling of love at first sight for the girl Doe, who never existed, I count as one of the strongest forces that helped to create my later affection for the real Edgar Gray Doe.  \"I think you and I must have been intended to come together, Rupert,\" I heard him saying later on, as I was fast dozing off. \"I s'pose that's why we were called Doe and Ray.\"  \"Er,\" I dreamily assented from beneath the bedclothes.  And still later a voice said:  \"It was rather fun being whacked side by side, being twins.\"  From a great distance I heard it, as I listened upon the frontier of sleep. And, recalling without any effort Radley's words: \"There's nothing like suffering together to cement a friendship,\" I crossed the frontier. All coiled up again, my knees nearly touching my chin, I passed into the country of dreams.     CHAPTER II  RUPERT OPENS A GREAT WAR   §1  Poor Mr. Cæsar, with the weak eyes! He had left his class-room door unlocked. _Golly_, so he had! And since the bell had only just ceased to echo, and Mr. Cæsar would certainly be some minutes late, what was to stop us from conducting a few operations within the class-room? Under the command of Pennybet, we entered the room and with due respect lifted the master's large writing-desk from its little platform, and carried it to the further end of the room. We left him his armchair, decently disposed upon the platform, thinking it would be ungenerous to keep him standing through an hour's lesson.  Then we guiltily stole out of the class-room, closed the door, and lined up in the corridor, as smartly as a squad of regulars. Aided by Penny's hand, we right-dressed. We kept our eyes front, heads erect, and heels together. We braced ourselves up still better when Mr. Cæsar appeared at the end of the corridor. None of us spoke nor moved. A few fools like myself giggled nasally, and were promptly subdued: \"Don't spoil it all, you stinking fish!\"  On came the gallant Mr. Cæsar, his eyes mutely inquiring the reason for this ominous quiet. He reached the door with no sign from any of us that we were aware of a new arrival. He tried the lock with his key and, after an expression of surprise to find it already turned, opened the door and walked in. Immediately, in accordance with a pre-arranged code of signals, Penny dropped _one_ book. We right-turned. We did it in faultless time, turning as one man, and each of us bringing his left foot with a brisk stamp on the floor. Then, a suitable silence having ensued, Penny dropped two books. Instantly we obeyed. In single file, our left feet stamping rhythmically, with heads erect and eyes front, we marched after Mr. Cæsar, and gradually diverged from one another till each man stood marking time at his particular desk. At this point Penny tripped over his left heel, and in an unfortunate accident flung all his books on to the floor. Abruptly, and like machines, we sat down. The room shook.  It was difficult for our master to know what to do; as there was no real reason to associate our military movements with Penny's series of little accidents, and there was certainly no fault to find with our orderly entry into the class-room. So he did nothing beyond sadly sweeping us with his eyes. And then he inquired:  \"Where's my desk?\"  Goodness gracious, where could his great desk be? We got out of our seats, foreseeing a long search. We began by opening our own desks and looking inside. Certain high lockers that stood against the wall we opened. It was in none of them. We pulled ourselves up and looked along the top of these lockers. It was not there. Penny did three or four of these \"pull-ups\" by way of extending his biceps. We looked along the walls and under the forms. Penny created a little excitement by declaring that \"he thought he saw it then.\" And Doe opened the door and looked up and down the corridor.  \"It's not anywhere in the corridor,\" said he. The whole class felt he might be mistaken, and went to the door to satisfy themselves.  Mr. Cæsar affected a little sarcasm.  \"Is not that it at the other end of the room?\"  We turned round and gazed down the direction in which he was looking. Yes, there was surely something there. Penny flung up his hand and cried:  \"Please, teacher, I've found it.\"  \"Well,\" began Mr. Cæsar, \"if one or two of you would bring the desk up here--\"  If one or two of us would! Why, we all would--all twenty of us. We took off our coats and, folding them carefully, laid them on the desks. We rolled up our shirt-sleeves above the elbows, disclosing a lot of white, childish forearms. We spat on our hands and rubbed them together. We did a little spitting on one another's hands. Then we hustled and crowded round the desk. We lifted it off the ground, brought it a foot or two, and dropped it heavily. Phew! it was hard work. We took out our handkerchiefs, and wiped the sweat from our brows. Anyone who had no handkerchief borrowed from someone who had finished with his. Returning to our task, we carried the desk a little nearer and dropped it. Doe got a serious splinter in his hand, and we all pulled it out for him. Puffing and groaning as we dragged the unwieldy desk, we approached the dais on which it must be placed. We all stepped upon the dais (slightly incommoding Mr. Cæsar, who was standing there), and lifted up one end of the desk so that the pens and pencils rattled inside. One pull, my lads, and the desk was half on the platform and half on the floor. Leaving it in this inclined position, we stepped down to the floor again, and three of us placed our shoulders against the lower end, while the rest scrummed down, Rugby fashion, in row upon row behind one another. A good co-operative shove, accompanied by murmurs of \"Coming on your right, forwards; heel it out, whites; break away, forwards!\" and up she went, a diagonal route into the air. Unfortunately, we all raised our heads at the same time to see how much further she had to go, and back she tobogganed again on to the shins of the boys in the front row. They declared they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15033"],["title","Tell England (#8)"],["body","henceforth incapacitated for life.  We got it on to the platform at last with a good run, but the enthusiasm of the back row of scrummers, who apparently thought the task could not be completed till they were off the floor and on the platform, was so strong that the desk was pushed much too far, and toppled over the further side of the platform.  This was too much. My suppressed giggling burst like a grenade into uncontrolled laughter. Then I said: \"I'm sorry, sir.\"   §2  But this disorder is a strong dish, and we've talked about quite as much as is good for us. So let us change the hour and visit another class-room, where there are no rebellions, but nevertheless arithmetic and trouble--and Ray and Doe and Pennybet. And here is a dear little master in charge. It is Mr. Fillet, the housemaster of Bramhall House, where, as you know, we were paying guests--a fat little man with a bald pate, a soft red face, a pretty little chestnut beard, and an ugly little stutter in his speech. Bless him, the dear little man, we called him Carpet Slippers. This was because one of his two chief attributes was to be always in carpet slippers. The other attribute was to be always round a corner.  Fillet, or Carpet Slippers, disliked his young boarder, Rupert Ray. The reason is soon told. One night, when I was out of my bed and gambolling in pyjamas about the first story of his house, I looked up the well of the staircase and saw the little shadow of someone parading the landing above. Thinking it to be a boy, I called out in a stage-whisper: \"Is that old pig, Carpet Slippers, up there?\" And a dear little chestnut beard and a smile came over the balusters, accompanied by a voice: \"Yes, h-h-here he is. Wh-what do you want with him?\"  It was Fillet, in carpet slippers, and round a corner.  And then in his class-room, this day, I got a sum wrong. I deduced that in a certain battle \"point 64\" of a soldier remained wounded on the field, while \"point 36\" escaped with the retreating army unhurt. This did not seem a satisfactory conclusion either to the sum or to the soldier, and I was not surprised, on looking up the answer, to find that I was wrong. There were two methods of detecting the error: one was to work through the sum again, the other was to submit it to Fillet for revision. The latter seemed the less irksome scheme, and in a sinister moment--heavens! how pregnant with consequences it was--I left my desk, approached Carpet Slippers, and laid the trouble before him.  Now Fillet was in the worst of tempers, having been just incensed by a boy who had declared that two gills equalled one pint, two pints one quart, and two quarts one rod, pole, or perch. So, when I brought my sum up and giggled at the answer, he looked at me as if he neither liked me nor desired that I should ever like him. Then he indulged in cheap sarcasms. This he was wont to do, and, after emitting them through his silky beard, he would draw in his breath through parted teeth, as a child does when it has the taste of peppermint in its mouth.  \"I-I-I t-tell you, a boy in a kindergarten could get it right--a g-g-guttersnipe could. I-I-I-I--\"  This was so much like what they yell from a fire-engine that, though I struggled hard, I could not contain a giggle.  \"I-I-I'll do it for you.\"  He got it wrong, which elicited a bursting giggle from me. Fillet turned on me like a barking dog.  \"Go to your place, boy, and take your vulgar guffaws with you!\"  Surprised at Fillet's taking it to heart in this way, I went, much abashed, to my seat, and tried to control my fit of giggling. But it so possessed me that finally it made a very horrible noise in my nose. Carpet Slippers raised his little head that was a hybrid between a peach and a billiard ball--a peach as to the face, and a billiard ball as to the cranium--and when he saw me sitting with lips tightly set and my desk trembling with my internal laughter, anger put a fresh coating of red upon both peach and ball. But he took no action at present.  \"I-I'll d-do one of these sums on the board for you.\"  Getting up, he turned his back on us and, facing the board, wrote with his chalk the number 10. Now, as he wrote on a level with his eyes, his fat little head quite eclipsed his writing. So, simply to show that I was no longer laughing, I called out loudly:  \"What number, sir?\"  Round swung Carpet Slippers, his peach-face assuming the tint of a tomato.  \"What number? I-I'll t-teach you to ask 'what number' when I've written '10' on the board. I-I've heard what you do in other class-rooms. D-don't think you're going to introduce your hooliganism here. Go and ask the p-porter to let me have a cane.\"  The boys pricked up their ears and looked at me. Penny let his jaw drop in amazement and, leaving his mouth open, maintained an expression like that of the village idiot. I stared, flabbergasted, into Carpet Slippers' face.  \"But, sir--\" I ventured. Tears and temper began to rise in me.  \"D-don't argue. Do what you're told.\"  \"But, sir--\" And then, like a cloud, sullen obstinacy came down upon me. I was certain that he had been longing for an excuse to flog me. The pride and the relish of the martyr supported me as, without telling him that his head had obstructed my view, I walked out to do my message.  Finding the porter in his office, I politely inquired if he could spare a cane for Mr. Fillet; and, at my query, he grinned--the blithering idiot. The cane that he handed me I took, and, being at that moment a youngster who wouldn't have let his spirits sink for all the Fillets in the world, I offered back the cane and suggested:  \"I say, are you sure you couldn't lose this?\"  \"Quite sure, sir.\"  \"Well, look here, do you really think you can manage to part with it?\"  \"Quite sure, sir.\"  \"Well, don't you think that, for a man of your age, you look rather a fool standing up there and saying 'Quite sure' to everything that's said to you? Don't you think it's rather a fat and silly thing to do?\"  I put it to him as man to man.  \"Quite sure, sir,\" he replied with a laugh.  \"Go to blazes,\" I said, \"and take your vulgar guffaws with you.\"  On my way back I stayed to admire the classical busts and statues that lined the deserted corridors like exhibits in a museum. All the life-size ones I whacked with my cane. I took a wistful pleasure in giving the naked ones two good strokes each. As I drew near the class-room door I certainly felt uncomfortable, for I knew Fillet intended to sting. But my sense of martyrdom carried me through. I gathered my dignity about me and knocked heavily on the door. Annoyed that my hand had trembled and spoilt the effect, I opened the door briskly and shut it briskly. With a calm step and fearless look, both studied, for I copied Doe in these matters, I walked towards Carpet Slippers. The little man was pretending he had forgotten all about me, while really he had prepared a sarcasm with which to poison my wounds.  \"Oh, indeed. You've b-been a long time gone; but thrashings are like good wine--they improve with keeping.\"  He sucked in his breath with satisfaction.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied I. If there was any trembling about me it was inside and not visible.  He took the cane from my hand and examined its effectiveness. Then, intending a pretty little jest, he faced the class and commanded:  \"St-stand out, that boy who asked the number of the sum after I had put it on the board.\"  \"Swine!\" hissed somebody. I fancy it was Edgar Doe.  \"I'm here, sir,\" replied I from his side, white.  Pennybet, who all this time had kept his mouth agape and impersonated the village idiot, laid down his pen, closed his book, and disposed himself to watch out the matter. He was always callous when in pursuit of his object; and his object now was to suck the humour out of my painful position. He put his elbow on the desk, rested his head at a graceful angle on the palm of his hand, and half closed his Arab eyes. He looked like an earnest parson posing for a photograph.  Our engaging little master, having bent me over and arranged me for punishment, gave me ten strokes instead of the usual six--the number of the sum had been \"ten.\"  When I rose from my bended posture, how I hated Carpet Slippers, and was happy in my hate! I hated the silkiness of his chestnut beard; I hated the sheen of his pink cranium; I hated his soft rotundity and his little curvilinear features; I hated, above all, his poisonous speeches. As I walked to my seat, my body stinging still, I resolved to go to war with Fillet. I declared with all a child's power of make-believe that a state of war existed between Rupert Ray and Carpet Slippers. War, then, war, open or understood!  And when that class closed, no boy was more forcedly loud and lively than I: no boy shut his books with greater claps; no boy banged his desk more carelessly. Nor would I listen to sympathising friends, but laughed out in Fillet's hearing: \"You don't think I care, do you?\"  Fillet noticed my ostentatious display of indifference and perhaps felt apprehensive of the latent devil that he had aroused, but his inward comment, I doubt not, was: \"We'll see who's going to be master here. He can feel the weight of my hand again, if he likes. We can't let a bad-spirited little boy have all his own way. I think we'll break his defiance. I think we will.\" And possibly, as he said it, he sucked in his breath with satisfaction. Fillet realised that it was War and the first shots had been exchanged.   §3  This was the preliminary skirmish. Real and bloody battle was joined twenty-four hours later. But, in the meantime, there was an early-evening lull which enclosed a delightful cricket match. A team of junior Kensingtonians, that included Doe and myself, was going across Kensingtowe High Road to play the First Eleven of the Preparatory School, an academy flippantly known as the \"Nursery,\" its boys being \"Suckers.\" Edgar Doe had been a certain choice. Brought up in the midst of a great cricketing family, "]]]
