You shall be taken to Gravesend at once.\"  \"Gravesend!\" echoed Jack. \"You couldn't take us to a better place. But if you are German, why should you take us there?\"  \"German,\" repeated the man. \"You know we are English. You are the German spies.\"  \"No such thing,\" declared Frank, taking a hand in things. \"We are British officers and we thought you were German spies. That's why I fired at you. We thought you were here to learn the secret of the vanishing submarines.\"  \"Frank!\" cried Jack in warning, but it was too late.  \"The vanishing submarines, eh?\" repeated the stranger. \"So you have given yourselves away. Who but a German spy would be here seeking word of the vanishing submarines?\"  \"But I tell you----\" began Jack.  \"Silence,\" thundered the officer. \"You have betrayed yourselves, and that is enough. I give you my word you shall be shot in the morning.\"  \"Oh, I guess not,\" replied Frank with a laugh. \"I guess Lord Hastings will be able to get us out of this mess.\"  \"Lord Hastings?\"  \"Why, yes, we happen to serve under him; that's all.\"  \"Tell it to the marines,\" replied the man with sarcasm. \"I am not asking you to admit anything, for I know enough now.\"  \"Oh, all right,\" said Frank.  \"Climb into my boat,\" ordered their captor.  The lads complied.  \"Say,\" said Frank, \"this is Lord Hastings' motorboat. He told us not to lose it. Tie it on behind and pull it along, will you?\"  \"We'll pull it along all right,\" replied their captor. \"Now the best thing you fellows can do is to keep quiet.\"  The lads obeyed this gruff command, for they had nothing particular to talk about.  Half an hour later the motorboat docked at Gravesend and the boys were ordered to climb out, which they did, under the noses of their captors' weapons.  \"Where to now?\" asked Frank.  \"Where I tell you,\" was the reply.  Jack was struck by a sudden thought.  \"Will you tell me what time it is, sir?\" he asked the leader of the party which surrounded them.  \"As you ask in such a polite way, I shall do so,\" was the reply. \"I wouldn't tell this other fellow anything. He's too smart.\" He produced his watch, and after a glance at it, said: \"Five minutes to ten.\"  \"By George!\" exclaimed Jack. \"And we were to meet Lord Hastings at the Lion Inn at 10 o'clock.\"  \"I can promise you'll be at the Lion Inn at 10 o'clock,\" replied the leader of the capturing party, \"but whether you will find Lord Hastings there I can't say.\"  \"You mean you are taking us there?\" asked Jack.  \"Exactly.\"  \"That's what I call luck,\" broke in Frank. \"We'll be all right in a few moments now, Jack.\"  \"You'll be all right till in the morning, I can guarantee that,\" growled their captor.  At the door of the inn he motioned them to enter ahead of him. They did so and the first person on whom their eyes rested was Lord Hastings.  \"Well, I see you are on time----\" the latter began, and then broke off as he saw the armed men behind them.  \"Yes, sir, we are on time,\" replied Frank with a smile, \"and we have brought company to see you, sir!\"     CHAPTER III.  A LESSON.   Lord Hastings was on his feet by this time and advanced toward the two lads and their captors.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" he demanded of the man who appeared to be the leader.  \"We caught these fellows scooting down the Thames in a high-power motorboat, sir,\" was the reply. \"They were unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves and one of them took a shot at us. So we brought them here.\"  \"Do you know who they are?\" asked Lord Hastings, smiling a bit to himself.  \"No, sir; but I would take them for a couple of German spies, sir.\"  \"H-m-m,\" muttered Lord Hastings. He stroked his chin a moment and then asked: \"And what do you intend to do with them?\"  \"Turn them over to Colonel Masterson, sir, who will return about midnight. He is stopping here, sir.\"  Lord Hastings seemed to consider the matter a few moments, and then, with a gesture, he turned on his heel, remarking:  \"Well, I can't see that it is any of my business.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" said the boys' captor.  Frank and Jack had remained quiet up to this time, but now the former took a step after his commander, exclaiming:  \"Aren't you going to get us out of this, sir? You can explain that we have done no wrong.\"  Lord Hastings turned toward him.  \"I have this officer's word,\" he said, indicating the boys' captor, \"that you were captured under suspicious circumstances. I thought I knew you--both of you--but it may be that I have been mistaken. Stranger things have happened than for a man to sell out to the enemy. I cannot interfere with the officer in the performance of his duty.\"  \"But, sir----\" began Jack.  Now the officer interrupted.  \"You know them?\" he asked of Lord Hastings.  \"I thought I did,\" was the reply. \"It would seem that I have been mistaken.\"  \"I should say it does,\" said the officer. \"Certainly they were making their way down the river for no good purpose.\"  \"I am afraid I must agree with you. However, I shall not interfere. You may do as you think best with them.\"  \"Very good, sir.\" The officer motioned the boys to precede him to the stairs at the far end of the room. \"Up with you,\" he commanded.  Frank hung back.  \"Prod him up a bit there, men,\" instructed the officer.  A second man advanced and pushed his revolver against Frank's ribs.  \"Move along,\" he commanded gruffly.  \"Now look here----\" began the lad, but Jack interrupted him.  \"Come, Frank, don't be a fool,\" he said.  He led the way up the stairs, and Frank, still grumbling, followed. At the top of the steps the boys were marched into a small room. The door closed behind them and a key turned in the lock.  \"Now,\" said Frank, turning to his friend, \"what is the meaning of all this?\"  \"You know just as much about it as I do,\" was the reply.  \"But a word from Lord Hastings would have settled all this.\"  \"But he didn't give it, did he?\"  \"No, he didn't; and that's what seems so strange. It looks to me as though we are in for a peck of trouble.\"  \"Say! you heard what Lord Hastings said about 'selling out.' Do you think he believes us guilty of such a thing?\"  \"It's hard to tell what a man believes in times like these. Men have been stood up against a wall and shot on less evidence. You remember taking a shot at the other boat, don't you?\"  \"Yes, but----\"  \"'Buts' won't help us any, I'm afraid. I can't account for Lord Hastings' actions, but you may be sure he has good reasons for whatever he does. It may even be true that he suspects us.\"  \"By George! I don't believe that,\" exclaimed Frank.  \"It doesn't seem possible; but still you can't tell.\"  \"But what are we going to do?\"  \"Do? There is nothing we can do. We'll have to stay here until they decide what to do with us. There is nothing else to do.\"  The boys kept up their conversation for some time, and the more they talked the more they became convinced that their plight was more serious than they had at first supposed. It seemed very plain to them now that Lord Hastings must believe in their guilt and that he would not raise a finger in their behalf.  It was after midnight and the boys were still talking when the key again turned in the lock of the heavy door. It swung inward and their captor entered.  \"Down stairs,\" he said briefly, motioning them to march down ahead of him.  The lads obeyed this order.  There was no one in the room below; and the lads sat down before the fireplace to await whatever might transpire.  \"There will be no use trying to escape,\" said their captor. \"The place is surrounded. You would be shot down like dogs. Now just be as comfortable as you can. I have business elsewhere.\"  He wheeled about quickly and disappeared through the door and the lads heard him lock it after him.  \"Well, why are we allowed to sit here in solitary glory?\" asked Frank.  \"Ask me something easy,\" returned Jack. \"We're here; that's all I know about it. However, I don't imagine we shall be here alone very long.\"  And he was right, although the first corner could not possibly have been in his mind, nor the nature of his coming.  Jack's attention was attracted toward the window by a slight squeaky sound. The lad glanced toward it, but no second sound followed immediately.  \"Sounded like some one at the window,\" he said to Frank.  \"I didn't hear anything,\" said the latter.  A moment later the noise came again. Jack sat up straight in his chair.  \"Hear that?\" he asked.  Frank nodded affirmatively.  \"Some one there, all right,\" he agreed.  He made as though to rise, but Jack stayed him.  \"Wait and see what happens,\" he said softly.  Both leaned back in their chairs and seemed to pay no further heed to the window. But without looking each became aware that the window was being raised softly, and clear across the room they could hear the breathing of a man. A foot sounded on the floor and at that moment both boys sprang to their feet and faced the intruder.  Before either could speak, the newcomer laid a finger to his lips in a sign for silence and came toward them.  \"Quick!\" he whispered, when he was close to them. \"Tell me what you have learned. This may be your only chance!\"  Frank and Jack stepped back in astonishment.  \"Tell you what?\" demanded the latter.  \"What you have learned,\" repeated the man. \"About the vanishing submarines. What has happened to them?\"  Noticing the apparently puzzled looks on the faces of the two boys, the man smiled slightly and thrust a hand into his inside vest pocket.  \"I see,\" he whispered. \"You want to be sure it is all right. Here. Look!\" he exhibited a small card. \"My number. Thirty-two. See it?\"  Jack's quick mind took in the situation on the instant.  \"But you are no German,\" he protested.  \"No, I'm English. Name of Davis. But I am in the game for what it's worth, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14711"],["title","The Boy Allies Under the Sea; Or, The Vanishing Submarines (#3)"],["body","as you are.\"  \"I see,\" said Frank. \"And you have been sent after our information?\"  \"Yes; and I shall have to hurry. We may be interrupted at any moment.\"  \"We haven't had time to jot down anything,\" said Jack, \"but we'll tell you what we have learned.\"  He whispered for some moments and Davis nodded understandingly. At last the boy ceased his whispering.  \"And that's all you know?\" asked Davis.  \"Absolutely all,\" replied Jack, and added to himself, \"and a whole lot more than I know, for that matter.\"  \"Then,\" said Davis, \"you believe that if we can get to the mouth of the Thames we can learn the whole secret?\"  \"That is my opinion,\" said Jack.  \"Good; then I'll pass the word along. Good-bye.\"  Davis moved toward the window and a moment later disappeared on the outside.  \"Now,\" said Frank to Jack, \"just what did you tell that fellow? I couldn't hear all that whispering.\"  \"Well,\" replied Jack, \"I told him we had learned very little; but that the secret of the whole affair was at the mouth of the Thames; that that was where we were heading for when we were captured.\"  \"And did you give him some kind of a hint as to the nature of the mystery?\"  Jack smiled.  \"Well, yes,\" he said. \"I told him he would find some queer explosives there and a large number of swift torpedo boat destroyers, equipped with submarine nets. I told him that these made nightly raids into the Channel and the North Sea and thus disposed of the German submarines.\"  \"And he believed it?\"  \"He seemed to. But that was the best I could do on short notice and knowing no more than I do of the matter.\"  \"Well, it wasn't so bad,\" grinned Frank.  \"I flatter myself that it could have been worse,\" returned Jack modestly.  They fell into a long silence, which was suddenly broken by Frank, who exclaimed anxiously:  \"Say! Do you suppose that could have been a trap?\"  \"Trap?\" repeated Jack. \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean, do you think Lord Hastings or some of the other British officers sent that man here simply to get evidence against us?\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I never thought of that. Whew! Maybe I have gotten us into worse trouble than ever.\"  \"If it was a trap, I guess you have,\" returned Frank glumly. \"Yes, it was a good job you did, I don't think.\"  \"Wait a minute, though,\" said Jack. \"If it were a trap, it would be plainly evident we didn't know what we were talking about. That should be enough to let us out.\"  \"Unless they believe we smelled a mouse and acted accordingly,\" returned Frank.  \"Oh, well,\" said Jack, \"there is no use worrying about it. We'll have to take what comes and that's all there is about it. Now, I'm going to rest a bit. When they come in, wake me up.\"  He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes; and in the meantime Frank continued to turn events over in his mind.  Half an hour later Lord Hastings, the man who had led the party that captured the boys, a figure attired in the uniform of a colonel of infantry, and several others entered the room. The uniformed man Frank immediately took to be Colonel Masterson, and he was right. Frank nudged Jack and the latter opened his eyes. Then both boys got to their feet.  \"So these are the German spies, eh?\" said Colonel Masterson.  \"That's not true,\" declared Frank hotly. \"We are no more spies than you are.\"  \"So?\" said the colonel insinuatingly. \"Then how does it happen you hold such friendly conversation with another man who is under suspicion?\"  Frank's heart sank. So it had been a trap, after all.  \"I can explain that, sir,\" said the boy, turning to Lord Hastings.  \"I have no doubt of that,\" was the reply. \"The question is, can you explain it satisfactorily?\"  \"Yes, sir, we can,\" interrupted Jack.  Here Colonel Masterson took a hand again. He spoke to Lord Hastings.  \"What shall we do with them?\" he asked.  \"That, colonel, is for you to decide,\" was Lord Hastings' reply.  \"Do you think it necessary to call a court martial?\" continued the colonel.  \"In view of the evidence we have, I should say not,\" returned Lord Hastings.  \"And still,\" said Colonel Masterson, half to himself, \"it seems to me that every man should be given a chance.\"  In the minds of the two boys now there was not the slightest doubt that they were in as perilous a situation as they had ever faced.  \"Lord Hastings,\" said Jack quietly, \"I assure you you are all mistaken. However, we shall protest our innocence no longer, for I see it would be useless.\"  And then the two lads were treated to one of the surprises of their lives. Lord Hastings' stern expression gave way to a smile, and he strode quickly toward them and extended a hand to each.  \"Surely,\" he said, \"you didn't think I doubted you.\"  The lads were too stunned to say a word.  \"I just wanted to teach you a little lesson,\" continued Lord Hastings. \"In the future, perhaps you will neither fall short nor go beyond your orders. I ordered you to Gravesend. You should not have gone beyond.\"  \"But Davis, sir?\" exclaimed Frank.  \"As long as you were here, apparently prisoners,\" was the reply, \"I simply used you to advantage. Davis is a German spy.\"     CHAPTER IV.  STRANGE WARFARE.   It was the following night.  Clad in heavy oilskins, Frank and Jack stood in the bow of the large, high-powered motorboat as it sped down the Thames in the darkness. Not a light was visible anywhere and it was impossible to see a yard ahead. But in spite of this, the boat fairly flew over the water; for the strong hand of Lord Hastings was on the wheel and there was not a spot in the river with which he was not familiar.  \"Whew!\" said Jack, as he turned about to shield his face from the icy spray. \"This is what I call taking a long chance, if you ask me.\"  \"I should say so,\" replied Frank, raising his voice to a shout to make himself heard above the sound of the whistling wind. \"Wonder how long we are going to keep this up?\"  \"Don't know,\" responded Jack. \"But I don't feel very comfortable. This is too fast for me.\"  \"Particularly when you can't see where you are going,\" Frank agreed.  Both became silent and peered into the intense darkness ahead.  For possibly half an hour the motorboat continued its terrific speed; and then it slowed down abruptly. The two boys heard Lord Hastings call them. They felt their way to where he stood by the wheel, for it was impossible to see.  \"Here,\" said their commander, \"take this searchlight and flash it ahead. See if you can pick up anything.\"  He passed a small but powerful searchlight to Jack, who again moved to the bow.  Jack pressed the little button and a tiny but brilliant light flashed over the water before the boat. There was nothing in sight, so far as the boy could see.  \"Nothing ahead, sir,\" he reported to Lord Hastings.  \"Guess we had better remain about here, anyhow,\" muttered Lord Hastings, half to himself.  Although the lads had no idea of the nature of their present mission, they had asked no questions of their commander. They knew he would tell them whatever he deemed necessary when the time was ripe; and until that time they were satisfied to await whatever might transpire.  But one thing the boys had noticed which had given them much food for thought. In the prow was mounted a small but heavy gun, and a second one of the same size loomed up formidably astern. Plainly they were there for a purpose, and Frank and Jack both realized that there was serious work ahead of them.  Lord Hastings himself had examined both guns carefully and announced that they were in first-class condition.  \"All ready for use,\" he had said.  And now, although neither lad knew it, the time was fast approaching when they were to be greatly needed.  Several times in the course of the next hour Lord Hastings ordered Jack to see what he could pick up ahead; but each time the result had been the same. There was nothing to disturb the calm peacefulness of the night.  And then they were spared the need of another look, for there suddenly loomed up less than a hundred yards ahead a dull-glowing white light.  \"To the forward gun, Mr. Templeton,\" ordered Lord Hastings, thus, for the first time on this mission, falling into old aboard-ship terms.  Jack sprang forward.  \"Man the gun astern.\"  Frank obeyed this command with alacrity.  Then the two lads awaited developments.  Apparently the craft ahead had not discovered the presence of the motorboat containing Lord Hastings, Jack, Frank, and a crew of four men; neither did the distance between the two boats seem to diminish. The two were not approaching each other.  \"Twenty-five knots,\" came Lord Hastings' command, and the little craft seemed to leap ahead.  The light ahead drew closer.  \"Train your gun on her, Mr. Templeton,\" ordered Lord Hastings, \"and if I give the command, fire to sink her.\"  This command was needless, for Jack had already gauged the range and trained the gun. Nevertheless he replied:  \"Yes, sir.\"  The pursuers now had approached within fifty yards of their quarry, and still not a sound save an occasional order from Lord Hastings had broken the stillness of the night. There had been nothing to indicate that the other boat was even occupied, save the sudden appearance of the light aboard.  But now, as the pursuers crept even closer, there came a sudden startled exclamation from ahead; and at the same moment the light disappeared.  \"Fire!\" cried Lord Hastings.  \"Boom!\"  Jack had fired the gun.  There was another startled exclamation from ahead.  \"Did you hit her?\" asked Lord Hastings.  \"Think so, sir,\" replied Jack. \"Don't see how I could have missed at that distance.\"  \"We'll cruise about a bit and see,\" said Lord Hastings.  He gave the command and the motorboat slowed down.  For half an hour the little craft circled about, but there was no trace of the other boat. All aboard flashed searchlights about the water, and the larger light in the bow was turned on, casting a bright ray over the water.  \"They've either gone away or to the bottom, sir,\" said Frank.  \"And I guess it's away,\" said Lord"]]]
