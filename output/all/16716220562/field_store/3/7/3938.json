In a former paper I have referred to the Fugitive Slave Law, whereby runaway slaves should be captured and sent back to their owners. But about a decade before the war, a great Abolition wave had begun to flood the country. Thurlow Weed, William Lloyd Garrison, Parson Brownlow, John Brown and Mrs. Stowe, by the power of tongue and pen and printing press, endeavored to stir up the North to the pitch of fanatical desperation, and the slaves to revolt against their masters. It was not for the sake of the Union. Perish the Union, if only the slaves were freed. Drive out the Southern States if they refused to abolish them. Their acts and their words were the extreme of anarchy and tyranny.  Jealousy had long formed a vindictive element in their breasts. And how could the two sections be wholly fraternal? They had come from, not only different stocks of population, but from different creeds in religion and politics. There could be no congeniality between the Puritan exiles who settled upon the cold, rugged and cheerless soil of New England, and the Cavaliers who sought the brighter climate of the south, and who, in their baronial halls, felt nothing in common with roundheads and regicides.  In 1859 the tragic raid of John Brown at Harper's Ferry--his execution--and the startling effects of the open outbreak against slavery put the Southern States on guard. When the next presidential election came on it was apparent from Mr. Lincoln's debates with Mr. Douglas, what the future policy of the government would be. When he therefore, won the election, the south withdrew her representatives from Congress, and her states from the Union. Secession, so long threatened by both sections in turn, had come at last. Everything had been done on the floor of the House to harmonize the issues, but without avail.  On December 20, 1860 South Carolina passed the ordinance of secession. On January 9, 1861, Mississippi followed; Florida, January 10; Alabama, January 11; Georgia, January 19; Louisiana, January 26; Texas, February 1; Virginia, April 17; Arkansas, May 6; North Carolina, May 20; Tennessee, June 8.  To sum up the Causes for the secession of the South:  1. The State had always been supreme: each was a distinct sovereignty, not subject to the general government in matters of their own home rule.  2. The interests of the South were injured by the burden of tax for the benefit of the North.  3. The Republican party had determined that slavery should not be admitted in the territories--the Republicans were in power, and foreseeing further interference in their rights, the South thought the time had come to form an independent government.  4. The North refused to accept the compromise proposed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, which might have averted the war. Nor would she consent to submit the matter to a vote of the people; hence there was no chance for harmony. The aggressive measures of the North were such as no self-respecting State in the South could endure.  It had come to be a habit in Congress, to insult the South because she held slaves.  Reason and right alike succumbed to prejudice and hatred, and the dissatisfied States, weary of wrong and oppression, sounded the note of separation; and from every throat burst the refrain;--    We are a band of brothers,   Native to the soil,   Fighting for the property,   We've gained by honest toil.         *       *       *       *       *    Hurrah! Hurrah! for Southern rights hurrah!   Hurrah! for the Bonnie Blue Flag   That bear a single star.       The Southern Confederacy  Read May 11, 1909   More than a hundred years ago the American States rebelled against the tyranny of England, the mother country, and formed a Confederacy of and among themselves to work together for their own welfare and prosperity. It was granted by their Constitution, and by the States, that each or any individual State had the right under provocation, to withdraw from the pact.  Not quite fifty years ago the Southern States of this Union, having endured provocation after provocation, withdrew from their Northern oppressors, and formed themselves into the Confederacy, whose brief existence ran red with the best blood of her chivalrous land. War was not contemplated. A peaceable separation was desired. A peace conference was held to which representatives of the States were invited. Measure after measure was proposed, so that war might be averted. All were rejected. The recusant States must be whipped back into submission to the autocrats that would direct their affairs. With restricted territory, a minority of population, and home interests directly opposed to those of the over-riding North, what was there to hope for but continuous degradation? Our leaders have been accused of precipitating the war for their own personal ambition. It was another \"Aaron Burr conspiracy.\" Let us hear what they had to say about it.  Jefferson Davis, the fearless soldier and upright citizen--the man who by reason of his supreme fitness was a little later, chosen President of the Confederacy, said in his last speech before the United States Senate:    \"Secession is to be justified upon the basis that the States are   sovereign. When you deny us the right to withdraw from a government   which threatens our rights, we but tread in the paths of our fathers   when we proclaim our independence. I am sure I but express the feelings   of the people whom I represent, toward those whom you represent, when   I say I hope, and they hope, for peaceable relations with you, though   we must part. This step is taken, not in hostility to others, not to   injure any section of the country, not even for our own pecuniary   benefit; but from the high and solemn motive of defending and protecting   the rights we inherited, and which it is our sacred duty to transmit   unshorn to our children.\"   Alexander Hamilton Stephens, of Georgia, Vice President of the Confederacy, was a Whig, and like others of the leading statesmen, loved the Union. When the North began to control the new territories, and thus denied the South her legitimate share in the government thereof, Mr. Stephens made a long and powerful argument in the House of Representatives at Washington, some years before the Secession. He said in part:     \"If you men of the North, by right of superior numbers, persist in   ignoring the claims of the South, separation must follow; but why not   in peace? We say as did the patriarch of old, \"Let there be no strife,   I pray thee, between me and thee * * * for we be brethren. Is not the   whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me If thou   will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart   to the right hand then I will go to the left.\" In other words if we   cannot enjoy this public domain in common, let us divide it. This is a   fair proposition. * * * Unless these bitter and sectional feelings of   the North be kept out of the National Halls, we must be prepared for   the worst. Are your feelings too narrow to make concessions and deal   justly by the whole country? Have you formed a fixed determination to   carry your measures by numerical strength, and then enforce them by   the bayonet? If so the consequences be upon your own head. You may   think that the suppression of an outbreak of the Southern States would   be a holiday job for a few of your Northern regiments, but you may   find to your cost, in the end, that 7,000,000 of people, fighting for   their rights, their homes, and their hearthstones, cannot be easily   conquered. I submit the matter to your deliberate consideration.\"   Mr. Stephens, in a speech before the Georgia legislature opposed secession, but said: \"Should Georgia determine to go out of the Union, whatever the result may be, I shall bow to the will of my people. Their cause is my cause, and their destiny is my destiny.\"  These speeches and sentiments do not savor of stirring up strife--of leading the South into rebellion \"so that I may be king, and thou my standard bearer.\" There could be no treason in doing what the Constitution of the United States permitted. And so every speech of farewell made by Southern representatives, was one, first of pleading for redress--then of sincere regret that self-respect and justice forced the rupture. The South never desired war, or bloodshed. The North defied possible war, believing that within a month, at least, any resistance must certainly be conquered. \"We can easily whip them back.\" Well, it was done, but not so easily. Not till years of carnage had wrought their destiny.  John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, Vice President of the United States, was termed the arch-traitor of all. His published speeches are in the same spirit of regret, and of affection for the Union. In burning words he showed how the Northern representatives were trampling down the Constitution, and in eloquent remonstrance he pointed the way of escape from threatened disaster. After leaving Congress he entered the Confederate army as Major General, and served as Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Davis.  Robert Toombs, of Georgia, was Secretary of State. In his speech before the U.S. Senate in January, 1861, he reminded his hearers that the Southern States had hundreds of sympathizers among the men of the North, \"who respect their oaths, abide by compacts, and love justice.\"    \"The brave and patriotic men of the South appealed to the Constitution,   they appealed to justice, they appealed to fraternity, until the   Constitution, justice, and fraternity were no longer listened to in the   legislative halls of their country, and then, sir, they prepared for   the arbitrament of the sword. And now you see the glistening bayonet,   and you hear the tramp of armed men from your Capitol to the Rio   Grand. And all that they have ever demanded is that you abide by the   Constitution, as they have done. What is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15006"],["title","Historic Papers on the Causes of the Civil War (#6)"],["body"," that we demand? That we   may settle in present or acquired territories with our property,   including slaves, and that when these territories shall be admitted   as States they shall say for themselves whether they wish to have free   or slave labor. That is our territorial demand. We have fought for this   territory when blood was its price. We have paid for it when gold was   its price. New England has contributed very little of blood or money.\"   The senator goes on to specify what further measures the South demanded, in sharp, incisive terms, but this extract suffices to show that our leaders used every power of tongue and moral suasion to stave off bloodshed.  Houston, Governor of Texas, in a public speech advised constitutional means--anything in reason to prevent war.  Robert E. Lee, the great, the good, was cut to the heart at the impending calamity. One of his friends said: \"I have seldom seen a more distressed man.\" Lee said: \"If Virginia stands by the old Union so will I. But if she secedes, then I shall follow my native state with my sword, and, if need be with my life. These are my principles and I must follow them.\"  Many public men in the North urged peaceable secession, notably, Horace Greely. Foreign eyes were turned anxiously toward America. The South was sending out millions of pounds of cotton every year, of which the greater part went to England. A London paper of this decade said:    \"The lives of nearly two million of our country are dependent upon the   cotton crops of the States. Should any dire calamity befall the land of   cotton, a thousand of our merchant ships would rot idly in dock; ten   thousand mills must stop their busy looms; two thousand mouths would   starve for lack of food to feed them.\"   In 1860, a Southern Senator said in congress;    \"There are 5,000,000 of people in Great Britain who live upon cotton.   Exhaust the supply one week, and all England is starving. I tell you   COTTON IS KING.\"   But the die was cast. The ordinance of secession of South Carolina unanimously passed December 20, at a quarter past one o'clock. Great crowds were outside the hall of conference awaiting results. The _Charleston Mercury_ issued an extra, of which six thousand copies were sold. The chimes of St. Michaels pealed exultant notes; bells of all other churches simultaneously rang. The gun by the post-office christened \"Old Secession\" belched forth in thundering celebration. Cannons in the citadel echoed the glad tidings; houses and shops emptied their people into the streets; cares of business and family were forgotten; all faces wore smiles--joy prevailed. Old men ran shouting down the streets--friend met friend in hearty hand clasp--the sun shone brilliantly after three days of rain--volunteers donned their uniforms and hastened to their armories. New palmetto flags appeared everywhere. Everyone wore a blue cockade in his hat. Great enthusiasm was shown at the unfurling of a banner on which blocks of stone in an arch typified the fifteen Southern States. These were surmounted by the statue of John C. Calhoun, with the Constitution in his hand, and the figures of Faith and Hope. At the base of the arch were blocks broken in fragments representing the Northern States. A scroll interpreted the allegory to mean a Southern Republic built from the ruins of the other half of the country.  The sentiment of the community was shared by boys firing noisy crackers and Roman candles. The patricians of Charleston drank champagne with their dinners. That night there were grand ceremonies, with military companies, bonfires, and glad demonstrations. The sister states soon caught the infection, and sharing in the hope of independence, they too withdrew from the Union.  On February 4, 1861, delegates from the seceded states--Virginia, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee, had met at Montgomery Alabama to organize the government of the Confederate States. The President and Commander-in-chief, Jefferson Davis, was inaugurated at the State House. Montgomery, February 18, 1861 and again at Richmond, Virginia February 22, 1862.         *       *       *       *       *  =Inauguration of Jefferson Davis=  The Congress of Delegates from the seceding States met at Montgomery, Alabama, on February 4, 1861, and prepared a Provisional Constitution of the new Confederacy. This Constitution was discussed in detail, and was adopted on the 8th. On the next day, February 9, an election was held for the selection of Chief Executive Officers, Jefferson Davis, born in Kentucky, but a resident of Mississippi, being elected President, and Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice President. While these important events were transpiring Mr. Davis was at his home, Briarfield, in Mississippi. It was his preference to take active service in the field, but he bowed to the will of his people, and set out for Montgomery to take the oath of office, and assume the tremendous responsibilities to which he had been assigned in the great drama about to be enacted. On his way to Montgomery he passed through Jackson, Grand Junction, Chattanooga, West Point and Opelika. At every principal station along the route he was met by thousands of his enthusiastic fellow-countrymen, clamoring, for a speech. During the trip he delivered about twenty-five short speeches, and his reception at Montgomery was an ovation. Eight miles from the capital he was met by a large body of distinguished citizens, and amid the huzzas of thousands and the booming of cannon he entered the city.  From the balcony of the Exchange Hotel he addressed, shortly after his arrival, the immense throng that filled the streets. February 18th had been chosen for the day of the inauguration, and as the time drew near the excitement increased. The ceremony was carried out with all the solemnity and ceremony that could be thrown about it. The military display was a beautiful one, and the martial maneuvers of the troops seemed to portend a victorious issue. A platform was erected in front of the portico of the State House, and standing with uplifted hand on this eminence, while all the approaches were filled with vast crowds of people, Jefferson Davis took the oath of office.  As the hour of noon approached an immense procession was formed, and to the music of fife, drum, and artillery it moved toward the Capitol building. On the platform awaiting the arrival of Mr. Davis were the members of Congress, the President of that body, the Governor of Alabama and Committees, and a number of other distinguished persons. Round after round of cheers greeted Mr. Davis. After being seated on the platform the Rev. Dr. Manley arose and offered an impressive prayer. President Davis arose and read his inaugural address; then turning, he placed one hand upon the Bible, and with the other uplifted, he listened to the oath. His face was upturned and reverential in expression. At the conclusion of the oath, in solemn, earnest voice, he exclaimed: \"So help me God!\" He lowered his head in tears, and hundreds wept as they viewed the solemn scene. Thus was officially launched upon a tempestuous sea the Confederate Ship of State.         *       *       *       *       *  =Order of Procession=.  Music.  Military Escort of Montgomery Fusileers, Capt. Schenssler; Montgomery Rifles, Capt. Farriss; Eufaula Rifles, Capt. Baker; Columbus (Ga.)Guard, Capt. Sims.  President-Elect, Vice President and Chaplain in an open carriage, drawn by six horses.  Congressional Committee on Ceremonies.  Various Committees.  Commissioners to the Government from States other than the States of the Confederacy.  Ministers of the Gospel, all in carriages.  Citizens in carriages and on foot.  The Department of State, of Justice, the Treasury, War, Navy, Post-office the various military corps, with officers and attaches--all in short, that it takes to form and conduct a government, was ordered from the best picked material. A Constitution was framed like that of the United States, in the main; but the unsatisfactory clauses that had wrought such havoc in the halls of Congress, were changed for the better.  There were in the Confederate service one commander-in-chief, seven generals, nineteen lieutenant-generals, eighty-four major-generals and three hundred and thirteen brigadier-generals. The roster of the Union greatly exceeded these numbers.  When all the departments were organized ready for the administration of the new republic, commissioners were sent to President Lincoln at Washington to negotiate for an equitable transfer of southern forts, and for terms of an amicable separation. They were refused audience. Every method known to national and international arbitration was attempted without success; so when the strife was precipitated, the south had no resource left but to resist by arms, no matter how overwhelming the odds of the invading section.  On April 12, 1861, General Beauregard, learning that a fleet was forcing its way into Charlestown harbor to join Major Anderson at Sumter, opened fire upon the fort. The North charged the war was thus inaugurated by the South. The South believed its action was necessary for self-defence. However that might be, it was the onset of battle--of the greatest Civil War the world has ever known. President Lincoln and President Davis both called for troops. Mass meetings were held in every part of the country North and South. The roll of the drum and the shrill fife of the march were heard in every direction. Muster rolls were drawn up, drills were in progress in hall and on the green. Every youth rush to take up arms. After the great Confederate victory at Bull Run, some one wrote:    \"They have met at last--as storm--clouds     Meet in heaven;   And the Northmen back and bleeding     Have been driven.   And their thunders have been stilled,   And their leaders, crushed or killed,   And their ranks, with terror"]]]
