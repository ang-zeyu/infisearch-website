If only he had _trusted_ me, and _stayed_ to face--  But he went without telling me _goodbye_, even, and we--  But he was _afraid_, you see--\"  Miss Satterly also glanced across to where Weary stood gloomily alone, his hands thrust into his pockets.  \"I really can't imagine Mr. Davidson as being afraid,\" she remarked defensively.  \"Oh, but you don't understand!  Will is _physically_ brave--and he was afraid I--  but I _believed_ in him, _always_--even when--\"  She broke off suddenly and became prettily diffident.  \"I wonder _why_ I am talking to _you_ like this.  But there is something so _sympathetic_ in your very _atmosphere_--and seeing _him_ so _unexpectedly_ brought it all _back_--and it seemed as if I _must_ talk to _someone_, or I should _shriek_.\"  (Myrtle Forsyth was often just upon the point of \"shrieking\") \"And he was _so_ glad to see me--and when I _told_ him I never _believed_ a _word_--  But you see, _leaving_ the way he _did_--\"  \"Well,\" said Miss Satterly rather unsympathetically, \"and how did he leave, then?\"  Miss Forsyth twisted her watch chain and hesitated.  \"I really ought _not_ to say a _word_--if you really don't _know_--what he _did_--\"  \"If it's to his discredit,\" said the schoolma'am, looking straight at her, \"I certainly don't know.  It must have been something awful, judging from your tone.  Did he\"--she spoke solemnly--\"did he _mur-r_der ten people, old men and children, and throw their bodies into--a _well_?\"  It is saying much for Miss Forsyth that she did not look as disconcerted as she felt.  She did, however, show a rather catty look in her eyes, and her voice was tinged faintly with malice.  \"There are _other_ crimes--beside--_murder_,\" she reminded.  \"I won't tell _what_ it was--but--but _Will_ found it necessary to _leave in the night_!  He did not even come to tell _me_ goodbye, and I have--but now we have met by _chance_, and I could _explain_--and so,\" she smiled tremulously at the schoolma'am, \"I _know_ you can _understand_--and you will not _mention_ to _anyone_ what I have told you.  I'm too _impulsive_--and I felt _drawn_ to you, somehow.  I--I would _die_ if I thought any _harm_ could come to Will because of my _confiding_ in you.  A woman,\" she added pensively, \"has so _much_ to bear--and this has been very _hard_--because it was not a thing I could _talk over_--not even with my own _mother_!\"  Miss Forsyth had the knack of saying very little that was definite, and implying a great deal.  This method saved her the unpleasantness of retraction, and had quite as deep an effect is if she came out plainly.  She smiled confidingly down at the schoolma'am and went off to waltz with Bert Rogers, apparently quite satisfied with what she had accomplished.  Miss Satterly sat very still, scarce thinking consciously.  She stared at Weary and tried to imagine him a fugitive from his native town, and in spite of herself wondered what it was he had done.  It must be something very bad, and she shrank from the thought.  Then Cal Emmett came up to ask her for a dance, and she went with him thankfully and tried to forget the things she had heard.  Weary, after dancing with every woman but the one he wanted, and finding himself beside Myrtle Forsyth with a frequency that puzzled him, felt an unutterable disgust for the whole thing.  After a waltz quadrille, during which he seemed to get her out of his arms only to find her swinging into them again, and smiling up at him in a way he knew of old, he made desperately for the door; snatched up the first gray hat he came to--which happened to belong to Chip--and went out into the dewy darkness.  It was half an hour before he could draw the hostler of the Dry Lake stable away from a crap game, and it was another half hour before he succeeded in overcoming Glory's disinclination for a gallop over the prairie alone.  But it was two hours before Miss Forsythe gave over watching furtively the door, and it was daylight before Chip Emmett found a gray hat under the water bench--a hat which he finally recognized as Weary's and so appropriated to his own use.     PART FOUR  Weary clattered up to the school-house door to find it erupting divers specimens of young America--by adoption, some of them.  He greeted each one cheerfully by name and waited upon his horse in the shade.  Close behind the last sun-bonnet came Miss Satterly, key in hand. Evidently she had no intention of lingering, that night; Weary smiled down upon her tentatively and made a hasty guess as to her state of mind--a very important factor in view of what he had come to say.  \"It's awful hot, Schoolma'am; if I were you I'd wait a while--till the sun lets up a little.\"  To his unbounded surprise, Miss Satterly calmly sat down upon the doorstep.  Weary promptly slid out of the saddle and sat down beside her, thankful that the step was not a wide one.  \"You've been unmercifully hard to locate since the dance,\" he complained.  \"I like to lost my job, chasing over this way, when I was supposed to be headed another direction.  I came by here last night at five minutes after four, and you weren't in sight anywhere; was yesterday a holiday?\"  \"You probably didn't look in the window,\" said the schoolma'am.  \"I was writing letters here till after five.\"  \"With the door shut and locked?\"  \"The wind blew so,\" explained Miss Satterly, lamely.  \"And that lock--\"  \"First I knew of the wind blowing yesterday.  It was as hot as the hubs uh he--as blue blazes when I came by.  There weren't any windows up, even--I hope you was real comfortable.\"  \"Perfectly,\" she assured him.  \"I'll gamble yuh were!  Well, and where were yuh cached last Sunday?\"  \"Nowhere.  I went with Bert and Miss Forsyth up in the mountains.  We took our lunch and had a perfectly lovely time.\"  \"I'm glad somebody had a good time.  I got away at nine o'clock and came over to Meeker's--and you weren't there; so I rode the rim-rocks till sundown, trying to locate yuh.  It's easier hunting strays in the Bad Lands.\"  Miss Satterly seemed about to speak, but she changed her mind and gazed at the coulee-rim.  \"It's hard to get away, these days,\" Weary went on explaining.  \"I wanted to come before the dance, but we were gathering some stuff out the other way, and I couldn't.  The Old Man is shipping, yuh see; we're holding a bunch right now, waiting for cars.  I got Happy Jack to stand herd in my place, is how I got here.\"  The schoolma'am yawned apologetically into her palm.  Evidently she was not greatly interested in the comings and goings of Weary Davidson.  \"How did yuh like the dance?\" he asked, coming to the subject that he knew was the vital point.  \"Lovely,\" said the schoolma'am briefly, but with fervor.  \"Different here,\" asserted Weary.  \"I drifted, right before supper.\"  \"_Did_ you?\"  Miss Satterly accented the first word in a way she taught her pupils indicated surprise.  \"I don't reckon you noticed it.  You were pretty busy, about then.\"  Miss Satterly laughed languid assent.  \"I never knew before that Bert Rogers was any relation of Myrt Forsyth,\" observed Weary, edging still nearer the vital point.  \"They sure aren't much alike.\"  \"You used to know her?\" asked Miss Satterly, politely.  \"Well, I should say yes.  I used to go to school with Myrt.  How do you like her?\"  \"Lovely,\" said Miss Satterly, this time without fervor.  Weary began digging a trench with his spurs.  He wished the schoolma'am would not limit herself so rigidly to that one adjective.  It became unmeaning with much use, so that it left a fellow completely in the dark.  \"Just about everybody says that about her--at first,\" he remarked.  \"Did you?\" she asked him, still politely.  \"I did a heap worse than that,\" said Weary, grimly determined.  \"I had a bad case of calf-love and made a fool uh myself generally.\"  \"What fun!\" chirped the schoolma'am with an unconvincing little laugh.  \"Not for me, it wasn't.  Whilst I had it I used to pack a lock uh that red hair in my breast pocket and heave sighs over it that near lifted me out uh my boots.  Oh, I was sure earnest!  But she did me the biggest favor she could; a slick-haired piano-tuner come to town and she turned me down for him.  I was plumb certain my heart was busted wide open, at the time, though.\"  Weary laughed reminiscently.  \"She said--I think you misunderstood her.  She appears to--\" Miss Satterly, though she felt that she was being very generous, did not quite know how to finish.  \"Not on your life!  It was the first time I ever did understand Myrt. When I left there I wasn't doing any guessing.\"  \"You shouldn't have left,\" she told him suddenly; gripping her courage at this bold mention of his flight.  How she wished she knew why he left.  \"Oh, I don't know.  It was about the only thing I could do, at the time--the only thing, that is, that I wanted to do.  It seemed like I couldn't get away fast enough.\"  It was brazen of him, she thought, to treat it all so coolly.  \"And out here,\" he added thoughtfully, \"I could get the proper focus on Myrt--which I couldn't do back there.\"  \"Distance lends--\"  \"Not in this case,\" he interrupted.  \"It's when you're right with Myrt that she kinda hypnotizes yuh into thinking what she wants yuh to think.\"  He was remembering resentfully the dance.  \"But to sneak away--\"  \"That's a word I don't remember was ever shot at me before,\" said Weary, the blood showing through the skin on his cheeks.  \"If that damned Myrt has been telling yuh--\"  \"I didn't think you would speak like that about a woman, Mr. Davidson,\" said the schoolma'am with disapproval in her tone; and the disapproval not going very deep, there was the more of it upon the surface.  \"I suppose it gives evidence of a low, brutal trait in my nature, that you hoped I couldn't harbor,\" acceded Weary meekly.  \"It does,\" snapped the schoolma'am, her cheeks hot.  If she had repented her flare of temper over the gopher, she certainly did not intend letting him "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14542"],["title","The Lonesome Trail and Other Stories (#7)"],["body","it too soon.  She seemed inclined to discipline him a bit.  Weary smoked silently and raked up the sun-baked soil with his spurs. \"How long is Myrt going to stay?\" he ventured at last.  \"I never asked her,\" she retorted.  \"You ought to know--you probably have seen her last.\"  The schoolma'am blundered, there.  Weary drew a sigh of relief; if she were jealous, it must mean that she cared.  \"That's right.  I saw her last night,\" he stated calmly.  Miss Satterly sat more erect, if that were possible.  She had not known of this last meeting, and she had merely shot at random, anyway.  \"At least,\" he amended, watching her from the corner of his eye, \"I saw a woman and a man ride over the hill back of Denson's, last night.  The man was Bert, and the woman had red hair; I took it to be Myrt.\"  \"You surely should be a good judge,\" remarked Miss Satterly, irritated because she knew he was teasing.  Weary was quick to read the signs.  \"What did you mean, a while back, about me sneaking away from Chadville?  And how did yuh happen to have your dances booked forty-in-advance, the other night?  And what makes yuh so mean to me, lately?  And will yuh take a jaunt over Eagle Butte way with me next Sunday--if I can get off?\"  The schoolma'am, again feeling herself mistress of the situation, proceeded with her disciplining.  She smiled, raised one hand and checked off the questions upon her fingers.  You never would guess how oddly her heart was behaving--she looked such a self-possessed young woman.  \"I'll begin at the last one and work backward,\" she said, calmly.  \"And I must hurry, for aunt Meeker hates to keep supper waiting.  No, I will _not_ go for a jaunt over Eagle Butte way next Sunday.  I have other plans; if I _hadn't_ other plans I still would not go.  I hope this is quite plain to you?\"  \"Oh, it's good and plain,\" responded Weary.  \"But for the Lord's sake don't take up that talking in italics like Myrt does.  I can't stand this bearing down hard on every other word.  It sets my teeth all on edge.\"  The schoolma'am opened her eyes wider.  Was it possible Weary was acquiring an irritable temper?  \"_Second_,\" she went on deliberately, \"I do not _consider_ that I have been _mean_ to you; and if I _have_ it is because I _choose_ to be so.\"  Weary, observing a most flagrant accent, shut his lips rather tightly together.  \"Third--let me see.  Oh, that about the _dances_; I can only say that we _women_, as a means of _self-defence_, claim the privilege of _effacing_ undesirable, would-be partners by a certain _form_ of rejection, which _eliminates_ the necessity of going into unpleasant _details_, and--er--lets the fellow down easy.\"  The schoolma'am's emphasis and English seemed to collapse together, but Weary did not notice that.  \"I'm sure grateful to be let down easy,\" he said softly, without looking up; his head was bent so that his hat quite concealed from the schoolma'am his face, but if she had known him longer, perhaps she would have gone carefully after that.  \"As to your sneaking away from--wherever it was--surely, you ought to know about that better than I do.  One must go far to outdistance dishonor, for a man's misdeeds are sure to follow him, soon or late.  I will not go into details--but you understand what I mean.\"  \"No,\" said Weary, still with bent head, \"I'll be darned if I do.  And if I did, I know about where to locate the source of all the information you've loaded up on.  Things were going smooth as silk till Myrt Forsyth drifted out here--the red-headed little devil!\"  \"Mr. Davidson!\" cried the schoolma'am, truly shocked.  \"Oh, I'm revealing some more low, brutal instincts, I expect I'm liable to reveal a lot more if I hang around much longer.\"  He stopped, as if there was more he wanted to say, and was doubtful of the wisdom of saying it.  \"I came over to say something--something particular--but I've changed my mind.  I guess yuh haven't much time to listen, and I don't believe it would interest yuh as much as I thought it would--a while back.  You just go ahead and make a bosom friend uh Myrt Forsyth, Schoolma'am, and believe every blamed lie she tells yuh.  I won't be here to argue the point.  Looks to me like I'm about due to drift.\"  Miss Satterly, dumb with fear of what his words might mean, sat stiffly while Weary got up and mounted Glory in a business like manner that was extremely disquieting.  \"I wish you could a cared, Girlie,\" he said with a droop of his unsmiling mouth and a gloom in his eyes when he looked at her.  \"I was a chump, I reckon, to ever imagine yuh could.  Good-bye--and be good to--yourself.\"  He leaned to one side, swung backward his feet and Glory, obeying the signal, wheeled and bounded away.  Miss Satterly watched him gallop up the long slope and the pluckety pluckety of Glory's fleeing feet struck heavy, numbing blows upon her heart.  She wondered why she had refused to ride with him, when she did want to go--she did.  And why had she been so utterly hateful, after waiting and watching, night after night, for him to come?  And just how much did he mean by being due to drift?  He couldn't be really angry--and what was he going to say--the thing he changed his mind about.  Was it--Well, he would come again in a few days, and then--     PART FIVE  Weary did not go back.  When the hurry of shipping was over he went to Shorty and asked for his time, much to the foreman's astonishment and disgust.  The Happy Family was incensed and wasted profanity and argument trying to make him give up the crazy notion of quitting.  It seemed to Weary that he warded off their curiosity and answered their arguments very adroitly.  He was sick of punching cows, he said, and he wasn't hankering for a chance to shovel hay another winter to an ungrateful bunch of bawling calves.  He was going to drift, for a change--but he didn't know where.  It didn't much matter, so long as he got a change uh scenery.  He just merely wanted to knock around and get the alkali dust out of his lungs and see something grow besides calves and cactus.  His eyes plumb ached for sight of an apple tree with real, live apples on it--that weren't wrapped up in a paper napkin.  When was he coming back?  Well, now, that was a question; he hadn't got started yet, man.  What he was figuring on wasn't the coming back part, but the getting started.  The schoolma'am?  Oh, he guessed she could get along without him, all right.  Seeing they mentioned her, would some of them tell her hello for him--and so long?  This last was at the station, where they had ridden in a body to see him off.  Weary waved his hat as long as the town was in sight, and the Happy Family ran their horses to keep pace with the train when it pulled out, emptied their six-shooters into the air and yelled parting words till the Pullman windows were filled with shocked, Eastern faces, eager to see a real, wild cowboy on his native soil.  Then Weary went into the smoker, sought a place where he could stretch the long legs of him over two seats, made him a cigarette and forgot to smoke it while he watched the gray plains slide away behind him; till something went wrong with his eyes.  It was just four o'clock, and school was out.  The schoolma'am was looking down the trail, maybe-- At any rate she was a good many miles away from him now--so many that even if he got off and had Glory right there and ran him every foot of the way, he could not possibly get to her--and the way the train was galloping over the rails, she was every minute getting farther off, and--  What a damn fool a man can make of himself, rushing off like that when, maybe--  After that, a fellow who traveled for a San Francisco wine house spoke to him pleasantly and Weary thrust vain longings from him and was himself again.  For two months he wandered aimlessly and, then, not quite at the point of going back and not being rich or an idler by nature, he started out, one gloomy morning in late November, looking for work.  He was in Portland and the city was strange to him, for he had dropped off a north-bound train the night before.  People hurried past without a glance in his direction, and even after two months this made him lonesome, coming as he did from a place where every man hailed him jovially by his adopted name.  There was little that he could do--or would do.  He tried digging ditches for the city, along with a motley collection of the sons of all nations but his, seemingly.  The first day be blistered both hands and got a \"crick\" in his back.  The second day, he quit.  On the third day, he brought up at the door of a livery stable.  A man with a slate-colored, silk waistcoat was standing aggressively in the doorway, one hand deep in his pocket and the other energetically punctuating the remarks he was making to a droop-shouldered hostler. Some of the remarks were interesting in the extreme and Weary, listening, drew a deep sigh of thankfulness that they were not directed at himself, because his back was still lame and his hands sore, and in Portland law-abiding citizens are not supposed to \"pack\" a gun.  The droop-shouldered man waited humbly for the climax--which reached so high a tension that the speaker rose upon his toes to deliver it, and drew his right hand from his pocket to aid in the punctuation--when he pulled his hat down on his head and slunk away.  It was while the orator was gazing contemptuously after him that he heard Weary cheerfully asking for work.  For Weary was a straight guesser; he knew when he stood in the presence of the Great and Only. The man wheeled and measured Weary slowly with his eyes--and there being a good deal of Weary if you measured lengthwise, he consumed several seconds doing it.  \"Humph!\" when the survey was over.  \"What do _you_ know about horses?\" His tone was colored still by the oration he had just delivered, and it was not encouraging.  Weary looked down upon him and smiled indulgence of the tone.  \"If you aren't busy right now, I'l"]]]
