And he believed the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\" What an occasion of joy? What strange manifestation of divine favor? They are scarcely paralleled in the history of man. But how sudden the reverse? The same day--_when the sun was going down_; lo! the brightness disappears, and _an horror of great darkness fell upon him_.  A deep _sleep fell upon Abram_. This was not a natural sleep. There is no probability that he would have given way to weakness, and fallen into a common sleep, while engaged in covenanting with God; binding himself with solemn engagements, and receiving tokens of the divine favor, and the promise of blessings for a great while to come. If he could have slept while receiving such manifestations of the divine friendship, it is not probable that his dreams would have been terrifying: His situation would rather have inspired joyful sensations, and exciting pleasing expectations. THAT which for want of language more pertinent and expressive, is here termed sleep, seems to have been divine ecstasy--such influence of the holy spirit operating in the soul, as locked it up from everything earthly, and shut out worldly things, as effectually as a deep sleep, which shuts up the soul and closeth all its avenues, so that nothing terrestrial can find admittance.  This was often experienced by the prophets, when God revealed himself to them, and made known his will. Thus Daniel, when the angel Gabriel was sent to solve his doubts, and let him into futurity--\"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground.\" The holy prophet, filled with fear at the approach of the celestial messenger, could not have fallen asleep, like some careless attendant in the house of God. Yet such is the language used to express his situation at that time, and afterwards on a similar occasion.* The three disciples, who witnessed the transfiguration, experienced similar sensations--sensations which absorbed the soul, and shut out terrestrial objects, which the evangelist compares to sleep.  * Daniel viii. 18, x. 9.  But why was Abram's joy, occasioned by the communications of the morning, so soon turned to horror.  The reasons are with him \"Whose judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.\" We may observe, however, that such is the way of God with man, while here on trial. If at any time a person seems peculiarly favored of heaven, something of a different nature is commonly set over against it. Perhaps to remind him that this is not his rest. We seldom enjoy prosperity without a sensible mixture of adversity; or without somewhat adverse following in quick succession. \"Even in laughter, the heart is sorrowful, and the end of mirth is heaviness.\" Neither are special trials or sorrows sent alone; comforts and consolations are usually joined with the, or soon succeed them. If we consider the matter, we shall observe this in ourselves; and may often discover it in others. We see it in the history of this patriarch, and that of many of his descendants.  The pilgrimage of Jacob, how remarkably diversified with good and evil, with joy and sorrow? That also of Joseph--of Moses--of Daniel? At times each of these were raised high and brought low--sometimes found themselves at the summit of earthly honor and felicity; at other times, were cast down, and hope seemed ready to forsake them.  In the history of Job the same things are exemplified in still stronger colors. That holy man experienced the extremes of honor and infamy, joy and grief, hope and terror. The prophets and apostles, passed through scenes in many respects similar; their joys and sorrows were contrasted to each other. Daniel's mournings and fastings were followed with remarkable discoveries and cheering revelations; but the divine communications were almost too strong for frail humanity; they filled him with dismay, and had well nigh destroyed his mortal body. \"He fainted and was sick certain days.\"  St. Paul was \"caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it was not possible for a man to utter\"--had a view of the ineffable glory of the upper world; but trials no less remarkable, and very severe, were contrasted to those strange distinctions, and more than earthly joys! \"Lest I should be exalted above measure, through the abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.\" *  * 2 Corinthians xii. 4-7.  St. john suffered sore persecutions--was banished from the society of his fellow Christians, if not from the society of men. But divine discoveries repaid all his sufferings--heaven's ineffable glories were opened to his view! What he witnessed could be but very partially communicated. Language is weak; only faint hints and general intimations could be given of the \"glory which is to be revealed.\" But the suffering apostle enjoyed it, and was supported, yea, enraptured by it.  This life is filled with changes. Good and evil, hope and fear, light and darkness, are set over against each other. The saints, while they dwell in the dust, sometimes walk in darkness, and have their hours of gloom and horror--\"The whole creation groaneth and travaileth together in pain until now--Even those who have the first fruits of the spirit, groan within themselves, waiting for--the redemption of the body. Those of whom the world is not worthy, are often in heaviness, through manifold temptations.\"  We may wonder at these things: but when we consider them as ordered of God, the consideration, should calm our minds, and bring us to say with the astonished Shunamite of old, \"It is well.\" *  * 2 Kings iv. 26.  God doth not order sorrows to his creatures here, because he delights in their sufferings. \"He grieves not willingly, neither afflicts the children of men. He doth it for their profit, that they may be partakers of his holiness.\" And which of the saints hath not received benefit from it? Who among them hath not sometimes been ready to adopt the language of the psalmist, \"It is good for me, that I have been afflicted.\"  \"Born of the earth, we are earthly\"--our afflictions naturally descend. We are prone to set our affections on temporal things, and set up our rest where there is no abiding. Therefore do we need afflictions to keep us mindful of our situation. Such remains of depravity are left in the renewed, that prosperity often corrupts them. But for the sorrows and sufferings ordered out to them, they would forget God and lose themselves among the deceitful cares, and infatuating allurements of this strange land.  Intervals of comfort are also needful for them. Were these denied them, \"the spirits would fail before God, and the souls which he hath made.\" And intervals of light and joy are given to refresh and cheer, and animate them to the duties required in this land of darkness and doubt. But they are not intended to satisfy. They answer like ends to the Christian during his earthly pilgrimage, as the fruits of Canaan, carried by the spies into the wilderness did to Israel while journeying toward the land of promise--serve to give them a glance of the good things prepared for them, to increase their longings after them, and animate them to press forward and make their way to the possession.  Such may be some of the reasons of those varied scenes through which the people of God are doomed to make their way to glory.  Often the saints find themselves unable to penetrate the design of heaven in the trials through which lies their way--especially in the hidings of God's face, so that they cannot discover him. This made no small part of Job's trial--\"Behold I go forward but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him.\" Could he have known the reasons of his trials it would have been a great consolations, but it was denied him, and the reasons of God's hiding his face from him, no less than those of his other trials.  So it is also with others. The darkness which involves them makes part of their trials. It is a common trial of the saints. God will have his people \"live by faith and walk by faith.\" To live by faith, implies want of light, and ignorance of the designs of providence. A great part of the good man's trial here, consists in trusting God without knowing why such things are required, or such trails ordered out to him. In this way the saints had great trials under the former dispensations. A veil was then spread over the method of grace, or way in which God would bring salvation to men. Even the religious rites enjoined by the law, were not understood, though they made part of the duties of every day; they remained mysterious, till Christ removed the covering cast over them; made known the hidden mystery, and opened \"the way into the holiest by his blood.\"  Under every dispensation religion greatly consists in referring every thing to God, and trusting in him, without being let into his designs, or knowing reasons of his orders. \"Blessed is he who hath not seen and yet hath believed\"--Blessed is he who without penetrating the designs of heaven trusts in God, and conforms to his requirements, not doubting but all will turn out right--that God will lead him in right ways, though they may be ways which he knows not.  Abram discovered much of this temper--in obedience to divine order he left his father's house, and \"went forth, not knowing whither he went.\" And afterwards, when commanded of God, he took a three days journey,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15033"],["title","Tell England (#0)"],["body","Team           TELL ENGLAND  _A Study in a Generation_   By ERNEST RAYMOND    NEW YORK GEORGE H.

I can find no better beginning than that.  When there devolved upon me as a labour of love the editing of Rupert Ray's book, \"Tell England,\" I carried the manuscript into my room one bright autumn afternoon, and read it during the fall of a soft evening, till the light failed, and my eyes burned with the strain of reading in the dark. I could hardly leave his ingenuous tale to rise and turn on the gas. Nor, perhaps, did I want such artificial brightness. There are times when one prefers the twilight. Doubtless the tale held me fascinated because it revealed the schooldays of those boys whom I met in their young manhood, and told afresh that wild old Gallipoli adventure which I shared with them. Though, sadly enough, I take Heaven to witness that I was not the idealised creature whom Rupert portrays. God bless them, how these boys will idealise us!  Then again, as Rupert tells you, it was I who suggested to him the writing of his story. And well I recall how he demurred, asking:  \"But what am I to write about?\" For he was always diffident and unconscious of his power.  \"Is Gallipoli nothing to write about?\" I retorted. \"And you can't have spent five years at a great public school like Kensingtowe without one or two sensational things. Pick them out and let us have them. For whatever the modern theorists say, the main duty of a story-teller is certainly to tell stories.\"  \"But I thought,\" he broke in, \"that you're always maintaining that the greatest fiction should be occupied with Subjective Incident.\"  \"Don't interrupt, you argumentative child,\" I said (you will find Rupert is impertinent enough in one place to suggest that I have a tendency to be rude and a tendency to hold forth). \"Surely the ideal story must contain the maximum of Objective Incident with the maximum of Subjective Incident. Only give us the exciting events of your schooldays, and describe your thoughts as they happened, and you will unconsciously reveal what sort of scoundrelly characters you and your friends were. And when you get to the Gallipoli part, well, you can give us chiefly your thoughts, for Gallipoli, as far as dramatic incident is concerned, is well able to shift for itself.\"  Little wonder that I was fascinated to read Rupert's final manuscript. And, when I had finished the last words, I announced aloud a weighty decision: \"We must have a Prologue, Rupert,\"--though, to be sure, my study was empty at the time--\"and it must give pictures of what your three heroes were like, when they were small, abominable boys.\"  And thereafter I busied myself in seeking information of the early childhood of Rupert Ray, Archibald Pennybet, and Edgar Gray Doe. Not without misgiving do I offer the result of these researches, for I fear all the time lest my self-conscious hand should profane Rupert's artless narrative.  In the year that the Colonel died he took little Rupert to see the swallows fly away. Colonel Ray was a stately, grey-bearded grandfather; and Rupert his flushed and blue-eyed grandson of six years old; and the two stood side by side and watched. Behind them lay the French town, Boulogne; beside them went the waters of the French river, the Liane. Suddenly Rupert, who had kept his blue eyes on a sky but little bluer, cried out excitedly: \"There they are!\" For him at that moment the most interesting thing in the world was the flight of swallows overhead. The Colonel, also, looked at the birds till they were out of sight, and then, after keeping silence awhile, uttered a remark which was rather sent in pursuit of the birds than addressed to his young companion. \"I shall not see the swallows again,\" he said.  Colonel Rupert Ray was no ordinary person. He was one of those of whom tales are told; and such people are never ordinary. The most treasured of these tales is the story of the swallows; and it goes on to tell, as you would expect, how the Colonel died that year, before the swallows came flying north and home again. He was buried, while little Rupert and Rupert's mother looked on, in that untidy corner of the Boulogne Cemetery, where many another English half-pay officer had been laid before him.  Of course the burial of the Colonel was very sad for Rupert; but he soon forgot it all in the excitement of preparing for the journey back to London. The Colonel, you see, had known that his old life would break up soon, and had summoned from their home in London the widow and child of his favourite son, \"that Rupert, the best of the lot,\" as he used to call him. And now the Colonel was dead. So his grandson, the last of the Rupert Rays, could look forward to all the jolly thrills of steaming across the Channel to Folkestone and bowling in a train to London. Really life was an excellent thing.  The day of the venturesome voyage began with excited sleeplessness and glowing health, and ended with a headache and great tiredness. There was the bustle of embarkation on to the boat; the rattle and bang of falling luggage; the jangle of French and English tongues; the unstraining of mighty ropes; the \"hoot! hoot!\" from the funnel, a side-splitting incident; the _suff-suff-lap-suff_ of the ploughed-up sea; the spray of the Channel, which sprinkling one's cheeks, caused one to roar with laughter, till more moderation was enjoined; the incessant throb of the engines; the vision of white cliffs, and the excitement among the passengers; the headache; the landing on a black old pier; the privilege of guarding the luggage by sitting upon as much of one trunk as six years' growth of boy will cover, and pressing firmly upon two other trunks with either hand, while Mrs. Ray (that capable lady) changed francs into shillings; there was the wearisome and rolling train-journey, wherein one slept, first against the window and then against the black sleeve of an unknown gentleman; and lastly there was the realisation that pale and sunny France had withdrawn into the past to make room for pale and smutty London.  Now the Captain of all these manoeuvres, as the meanest intelligence will have observed, was Mrs. Ray. Mrs. Ray was Rupert's mother, and as beautiful as every mother must be, who has an only son, and is a widow. Moreover she was a perfect teller of stories: all really beautiful mothers are. And, for years after, she used at evening time to draw young Rupert against her knees, and tell him the traditional stories of that old half-pay officer at Boulogne. And grandfather was indeed a hero in these stories. We suspect--but who can sound the artful depths of a woman who is at once young, lovely, a mother, and a widow?--that Mrs. Ray, knowing that Rupert could never recall his father, was determined that at least one soldierly figure should loom heroic in his childish memories. She would tell again and again how he asked repeatedly, as he lay dying, for \"that Rupert, the best of the lot.\" And her son would say: \"I s'pose he meant Daddy, mother.\" \"Yes,\" she would answer. \"You see, you were all Ruperts: Grandfather Rupert Ray, Daddy Rupert Ray, and Sonny Rupert Ray, my own little Sonny Ray.\" (Mothers talk in this absurd fashion, and Mrs. Ray was the chief of such offenders.)  But quite the masterpiece of all her tales was this. One summer morning, when the Boulogue promenade was bright and crowded and lively, the Colonel was seated with his grandson beside him. A little distance away sat Rupert's mother, who was just about as shy of the Colonel as the Colonel was shy of her (which fact accounts, probably, for Rupert Ray's growing up into the shy boy we knew). Well, all of a sudden, the boy got up, stood immediately in front of his grandsire, and leaned forward against his knees. There was no mistaking the"]]]
