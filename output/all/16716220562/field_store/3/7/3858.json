Presently they were in front of the beautiful Peristyle, gazing in awed admiration upon its grand Arch of Triumph, its noble colonnade and statuary, and catching glimpses here and there between its pillars of the beauties beyond.  It was impetuous Lulu who broke the silence with an exclamation of delighted admiration and an eager request that they might land at once and get a nearer view of the fairy scenes that lay before them on the farther side.  The other members of their party, old and young, seemed scarcely less eager, and in a very few moments they were all pacing that grand colonnade to and fro, and gazing out delightedly now upon the blue waters of the lake and anon upon the fairy scene--the Court of Honor--on the inner side. And soon they hurried their steps thitherward.  \"Oh, there,\" cried Lulu, \"is the statue of our great republic! Is she not magnificent?\"  \"She is, indeed!\" replied Grandma Elsie. \"See in one hand she holds a pole bearing a liberty cap, in the other a globe, an eagle with outstretched wings resting upon it; that symbolizes protection, which she has ever been ready to extend to the oppressed of all the earth.\"  \"She is a large woman,\" remarked Walter; \"as she should be to adequately represent our great country. Grandpa, do you know her size?\"  \"I saw it stated the other day,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore. \"Her face is fifteen feet long, her arms thirty feet, forefingers forty-five inches, and ten inches in diameter. Her cost was twenty-five thousand dollars; the gilding alone amounting to fourteen hundred dollars; quite an expensive dress for my lady.\"  \"But we don't grudge it to her, papa,\" remarked Grandma Elsie pleasantly.  \"No,\" he said; \"nor anything else the liberty she represents has cost--in money or in life and limb.\"  \"But what is her height, grandpa?\" asked Rosie; \"it should be very considerable to go with a face fifteen feet long.\"  \"Sixty-five feet, and the pedestal on which she stands is thirty feet above water. There is a stairway inside which you can climb one of these days if you wish.\"  All were gazing with great admiration and interest upon the beautiful statue, though seeing it somewhat dimly through the gathering shades of evening, when suddenly the electric lights blazed out from all sides, causing an exclamation of surprise and delight from almost everyone in our party and from others who witnessed the wonderful and inspiring sight; words failed them to express their sense of the loveliness of the scene; that mighty statue of the Republic dominating the eastern end of the lagoon, that grandly beautiful Macmonie's Fountain at the other, its Goddess of Liberty seated aloft in her chair on the deck of her bark, erect and beautiful, with her eight maiden gondoliers plying the oars at the sides, while old Father Time steered the vessel, his scythe fastened to the tiller, Fame as a trumpet-herald stood on the prow with her trumpet in her hand, while in the gushing waters below sported the tritons with their plunging horses, the terraced fountain still lower with its clouds of spray showing all the colors of the rainbow, as did that of the smaller ones to the right and left.  And what a ravishing sight was that of the Administration Building with its corona of light, its dome, arches, and angles outlined with those brilliant lights, as were those of the Peristyle also, and of the grand structures between--Manufactures, Electricity, and Arts on the north side, Machinery and Agriculture on the south--and the beautiful fountains throwing spray of all the colors of the rainbow.  \"What a magnificent sight!\" \"How lovely!\" \"How beautiful!\" exclaimed one and another as they moved slowly onward, gazing from side to side.  \"Let us go into the Administration Building,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.  All were willing, and they sauntered on toward it, still gazing delightedly as they went.  Reaching its doorway they paused for a few moments to look at the statue of Columbus, represented as landing with the Spanish flag in his hand, and to listen to the inspiring music of the bands; then passed on into the interior which they found as artistic and wondrously beautiful as the outside.  After feasting their eyes upon the lower part they took an elevator--of which there were six--and went up to the upper promenade, which they found also very beautiful, giving lovely views of the surrounding grounds. The vault of the dome was ornamented with allegorical paintings, some of them commemorating Columbus' discovery of America.  Looking out from the promenade under the dome they saw the Ferris Wheel, upon which they gazed with a good deal of interest.  \"I must have a ride in that,\" said Walter emphatically, \"and mamma, you will go with me, will you not?\"  \"Is it quite safe?\" she asked, looking from her father to the captain.  \"Oh, yes,\" they both replied, Mr. Dinsmore adding, \"and I think we will all want to go once if not oftener.\"  \"Go where, grandpa?\" asked a familiar voice, and turning quickly about they found Harold and Herbert close at hand.  Then there was an exchange of joyous greetings, and enquiries were made concerning some others of the family connection who had come by rail.  The answer was that some of the little ones were in bed at the hotel where boarding had been taken by the party, and in charge of the faithful attendants brought from home, while the older ones were scattered about the Court of Honor and other portions of the Fair.  \"We have been on the lookout for you,\" continued Harold, \"and only a few minutes ago discovered the _Dolphin_ lying at anchor down yonder on the lake. We had hoped you would be here sooner.\"  \"Yes, we thought we should have been here weeks ago,\" replied his mother, \"but as the delays were providential we did not fret over them.\"  \"If you had fretted, mother, it would have been truly surprising, as I never knew you to do so about anything,\" Herbert said, smiling affectionately into her eyes.  \"No, that was never one of her faults,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore.  \"No, indeed!\" exclaimed Rosie. \"But Harold, can you take us to the others? I am sure it would be pleasanter for us all to be together.\"  \"I cannot promise certainly,\" he replied, \"but if we walk about the Court of Honor we will come across each other finally, no doubt, as they will presently discover the _Dolphin_ and look about here for you.\"  \"Yes,\" returned his mother, \"they will surely know that we could not persuade ourselves to go farther to-night than this bewitchingly beautiful Court of Honor.\"  Even as she spoke all were moving toward the elevator nearest them, and in a few moments they were again strolling along the shores of the lagoon, gazing with delighted eyes upon the fairylike scene--imposing buildings, playing fountains, the waters of the lagoon dancing in the moonbeams, and the pretty crafts gliding over them filled with excursionists whose merry voices and laughter mingled pleasantly with the music of the bands.  \"Oh, this is just delightful, delightful!\" exclaimed Lulu. \"Father, dear, I hope you will let us stay a long, long while.\"  \"I have not thought of fixing the time for departure yet,\" returned the captain, \"and if our friends intend to go home in the _Dolphin_, as they came, there will be a number of voices entitled to a vote on the question. My wife for one,\" glancing down fondly upon the beautiful, graceful lady on his arm.  \"Thank you, my dear,\" returned Violet. \"I certainly feel no desire to start for home yet, dear and lovely as I esteem it.\"  \"Oh, here they are!\" cried a familiar voice at that instant, and the two sets of relatives had found each other. Glad greetings and kind enquiries were exchanged. Then they broke up into little groups and sauntered on through the beautiful scene till it was time to seek their resting places for the night, when, after making some arrangements for the sight-seeing of the next day, they bade good-night and hied them to their several places of temporary abode.     CHAPTER III.   \"On, we have a lovely view from here!\" remarked Lulu as they reached the _Dolphin's_ deck. \"I'm not at all sleepy, papa; can't I sit here for a while?\"  Grace was saying, \"Good-night, papa.\"  He returned it with a fatherly caress, then answered Lulu's query.  \"No, daughter; it is long past your usual hour for retiring, and as I want you to feel fresh and bright for to-morrow's pleasure, you, too, may bid me good-night and go at once to your berth.\"  \"Oh, yes, sir, that will be the best, I know,\" she said, rising promptly from the seat she had taken, and with a loving look up into his face--for he was close at her side now. \"What a happy thing it is for me that I have such a kind, wise father to take care of me!\"  \"A father whose strong desire it certainly is to make you and all his children as happy as possible,\" he said, laying a hand on her head and looking fondly down into her eyes. \"Good-night, daughter, and don't hesitate to call me if anything should go wrong with you or Grace.\"  \"Am I also under orders to retire, sir?\" asked Violet with a mischievous smile up into his face, as Lulu bade good-night to the rest of the company and disappeared down the companion-way.  \"Not from me,\" he said, pleasantly taking a seat at her side as he spoke. \"Have I not told you many times that my wife does what she pleases? At least, if she fails to do so it is in consequence of no order from me.\"  \"No; you have never given me one yet, and I believe I should like you to do so for once that I may see how it feels,\" she added with a low, musical laugh, slipping her hand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14910"],["title","Elsie at the World's Fair (#3)"],["body","into his.  \"Perhaps you might not find it particularly agreeable,\" he returned, pressing the little hand tenderly in his. \"But just to satisfy you I may try it one of these days. You are not disappointed in the Fair so far?\"  \"No, no, not in the least! Oh, how lovely it is! and what a beautiful view we have from here! How delighted our little Elsie and Ned will be with it all to-morrow. I hardly know how to wait for the time to come when I can see and share their pleasure.\"  But now the others were saying good-night and going down to their state-rooms, and the captain remarked laughingly that he thought the longed-for time would seem to come sooner if he and she should follow their good example.  \"So it will,\" returned Violet, promptly rising and slipping her hand into his arm.  She went first to her mother's state-room, and the door being opened in answer to her gentle rap, \"Are you quite comfortable, mamma, dear?\" she asked. \"Is there anything I can do or furnish to make you more so?\"  \"I am perfectly comfortable and I need nothing but a good night's rest, Vi, dear,\" was the smiling response. \"Something which I want you to be taking as soon as possible. We find ourselves here surrounded by so much that is wondrously enticing to look at, that I fear we will be tempted to neglect needed rest, and so make ourselves ill.\"  \"Ah, mamma, you and my husband are of one mind, as usual,\" laughed Violet, and then with a tenderly affectionate good-night they parted.  Both the captain and Lulu retained their old habit of early rising, and she joined him upon the deck the next morning just as the sun came peeping above the horizon.  \"Good-morning, papa,\" she cried, running to him to put her arms about his neck and give and receive the usual morning caress. \"Isn't this a lovely day? How we shall enjoy it at the Fair--that beautiful Court of Honor is just like the loveliest of fairylands.\"  \"With which my eldest daughter is quite familiar, of course,\" he returned with amused look and tone, and smoothing her hair caressingly as he spoke.  \"Well, I think I can begin to imagine now what fairyland may be like,\" was her smiling rejoinder. \"Papa, mayn't I keep close at your side, going wherever you go?\"  \"That is exactly what I want you to do,\" he said. \"I should be troubled indeed by losing sight of any one of my children, unless after putting him or her in the care of someone whom I could implicitly trust.\"  \"I don't want to be in the care of anyone else, papa,\" she hastened to say.  \"But it will be quite impossible to see everything here that is well worth looking at,\" he said, \"and our tastes may differ greatly in regard to the things we care to examine.\"  \"Still I care most of all to be with you, papa. I'm not afraid of getting lost, because I could easily find my way back to the Peristyle and wait and watch there for you and the rest, but I want to share in your enjoyment, and have you share in mine,\" laying her rosy cheek against his shoulder and lifting to his, eyes full of ardent affection.  \"That is right,\" he said, smiling, and patting her cheek.  \"Ah, here come your mamma, Gracie, and the little ones. You are early, my dear,\" to Violet as he handed her to a seat, took one at her side, drawing Grace to his knee for a moment's petting and fondling, then letting her give place to the younger two, both eagerly waiting for their turn.  \"Yes,\" Violet replied, \"we are all ready for an early start for the Fair.\"  \"As I expected,\" he said pleasantly. \"I have ordered breakfast to be on the table an hour earlier than usual, and if our guests appear in season we will have prayers before eating; so that we may be able to start soon after leaving the table.\"  \"Judging by some slight sounds I have heard, I think they are all up and will join us presently,\" said Violet.  \"Yes, mamma, I do believe we are all in a great hurry to get to the Fair,\" remarked her little Elsie. \"Oh, papa, is that it over there where that arch is with all those pillars on each side of it?\"  \"And, oh, papa, what big ship is that?\" cried Ned, catching sight of the _Illinois_. \"I like ships, and I want to go there. Can't I?\"  \"I intend to take you there one of these days,\" his father answered.  Just then the rest of the party came trooping up from the cabin. Morning salutations were exchanged, family worship followed, and then breakfast, during which plans for the day were again discussed and further arrangements made.  They had scarcely left the table when Harold and Herbert appeared, bringing further plans and suggestions in regard to the sight-seeing, for they were anxious to help the newer arrivals--particularly their mother--to the greatest possible enjoyment of the day.  After a little discussion it was finally decided that they would go first to the Ferris Wheel, from which they would have a fine view of the whole extent of the White City. \"Then to the Wooded Island, where we will probably find enough to keep us busy until dinner time,\" said Harold; \"perhaps even longer.\"  \"No matter if it should,\" said his grandfather; \"since we are not hurried for time, we may as well let all get their fill of everything; and if some want to tarry longer than others we can break up into smaller parties.\"  \"Yes, sir, I rather think we will find that the better plan, as our party is so uncommonly large.\"  It was large, but they were congenial and greatly enjoyed being together, sharing the same pleasures of sight and sound.  In another half hour they were all on shore enjoying a second view of the lovely Peristyle and Court of Honor, through which they passed on their way to the Ferris Wheel, the ride in which they found so delightful that at the earnest solicitation of little Ned they retained their seats during a second revolution. Then they left it and walked on to the Wooded Island.  \"I want to take you to the Hunter's Cabin,\" said Harold. \"See, yonder it is.\"  \"What! that old log building?\" exclaimed his sister Rose, catching sight of it among the trees. \"Who cares to look at such a thing as that?\"  \"I do,\" he returned lightly, \"since it is a museum and memorial of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett,--two historical characters who were very interesting to me in my youth,--and also gives one a very good idea of the manner of life of our Western pioneers forty or more years ago.\"  He led the way as he spoke, the others following. They found that the building consisted of one large room divided by a rope into two apartments, a public and a private one. There was a broad fireplace such as belonged to the dwellings of the pioneers of fifty or more years ago; there were beds and settees made of stretched skins, and skins of wild animals covered the floor; there were also tin dishes, candles, a stool made of a section of a log, and such cooking apparatus as was used in the kind of dwelling represented.  The cabin was occupied by a hunter who wore long hair and a wide-brimmed felt hat.  He was ready to answer questions, many of which were asked by the younger members of our party, who, as well as their elders, seemed much interested in this representation of pioneer life in the olden times.  \"Where now?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore as they left the Hunter's Cabin.  \"I think Master Neddie here would enjoy a look at the ostriches,\" remarked Herbert, with a smiling glance at the rosy, happy face of his little nephew, who was trudging along with his hand in that of his father.  \"Oh, yes!\" cried the child in a tone of eager delight. \"I should like to see them ever so much!\"  \"Then if no one objects, that is where we will go,\" said Harold, and as the only rejoinders from the other members of the party were those of assent, he led the way.  \"Is it a very expensive entertainment?\" asked Walter soberly.  \"Costs all of ten cents apiece,\" replied Herbert. \"An enormous sum, but one cannot expect to see Old Abe, General Grant, Jim Blaine, and Grover Cleveland for just nothing at all.\"  \"Oh, uncle!\" cried little Elsie, \"are all those great men there? Oh, no, of course they can't be--'cause some of them are dead. I know it was dear, good Mr. Lincoln they called Old Abe, and that a wicked man shot him long, long ago; and that General Grant was sick and died.\"  \"That is all true,\" returned her uncle, \"but these fellows still wear their feathers, and are very much alive.\"  \"Oh, I know now,\" laughed the little girl. \"You mean the ostrich man has named some of his birds after those famous men.\" They were now on the northern side of Midway Plaisance, and presently reached the enclosure where the ostriches were. There were twenty-three, full-grown, all from California. The sight was an interesting one to both the grown people and the children, and all listened attentively to the remarks of the exhibitor, delivered in solemn tones, in regard to the habits of the birds. He spoke of the male bird as most kind and self-forgetful in his treatment of his mate, or mates, saying it was he who built the nest and obtained the food; also that he would sit on the eggs in the nest for sixteen hours at a stretch, while the mother did the same for only eight hours. He had other things also to tell of the domineering of the female over the male, which caused some merriment among the ladies and girls of our party; to the gentlemen also, though they pretended to highly disapprove. But all laughed together over the ridiculous movements of the flock in passing from one side of the grounds to another.  \"What do they eat, papa?\" asked Ned.  \"Corn, grasses, seeds of various kinds,\" replied his father. \"They swallow large stones too, as smaller birds swallow sand to help grind up the food in the gizzard, and, indeed, ostriches have been known to swallow bits of iron, shoes, copper coins, glass, bricks, and other things such as you would think no living creature would want to eat.\"  \"They look very big and strong, papa,\" remarked the little boy, gazing at them with great interest.  \"Yes; they are so strong that one can"]]]
