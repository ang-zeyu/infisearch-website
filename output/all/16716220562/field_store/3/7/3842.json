So it has been said often by the fifty sachems who are old and very wise, and who know all that it is given to men to know. Did you hear anything stirring in the thicket, Dagaeoga?\"  \"I did, Tayoga. I heard a rustling, the sound of very light footfalls, and I see the cause.\"  \"A black bear, is it not, seeing what strangers have invaded the bush! Now, he steals away, knowing that we are the enemies most to be dreaded by him. Doubtless there are other animals among the bushes, watching us, but we neither see nor hear them. It is time to divide the watch, for we must save our strength, and it is not well for both to remain awake far into the night.\"  It was arranged that Robert should sleep first and the Onondaga gave his faithful promise to awaken him in four hours. The two lads meant to take the burden of the watch upon themselves, and, unless Willet awoke, of his own accord, he was to lie there until day.  Robert lay down upon his blanket, went to sleep in an instant, and the next instant Tayoga awakened him. At least it seemed but an instant, although the entire four hours had passed. Tayoga laughed at the dubious look on his face.  \"The time is up. It really is,\" he said. \"You made me give my faithful promise. Look at the moon, and it will tell you I am no teller of a falsehood.\"  \"I never knew four hours to pass so quickly before. Has anything happened while I slept?\"  \"Much, Dagaeoga. Many things, things of vast importance.\"  \"What, Tayoga! You astonish me. The forest seems quiet.\"  \"And so it is. But the revolving earth has turned one-sixth of its way upon itself. It has also traveled thousands and thousands of miles in that vast circle through the pathless void that it makes about the sun. I did not know that such things happened until I went to the white man's school at Albany, but I know them now, and are they not important, hugely important?\"  \"They're among the main facts of the universe, but they happen every night.\"  \"Then it would be more important if they did not happen?\"  \"There'd be a big smash of some kind, but as I don't know what the kind would be I'm not going to talk about it. Besides, I can see that you're making game of me, Tayoga. I've lived long enough with Indians to know that they love their joke.\"  \"We are much like other people. I think perhaps that in all this great world, on all the continents and islands, people, whether white or red, brown or black, are the same.\"  \"Not a doubt of it. Now, stop your philosophizing and go to sleep.\"  \"I will obey you, Dagaeoga,\" said Tayoga, and in a minute he was fast asleep.  Robert watched his four hours through and then awakened the Onondaga, who was sentinel until day. When they talked they spoke only in whispers lest they wake Willet, whose slumbers were so deep that he never stirred. At daybreak Tayoga roused Robert, but the hunter still slept, his gigantic bulk disposed at ease upon his blanket. Then the two lads seized him by either shoulder and shook him violently.  \"Awake! Awake, Great Bear!\" Tayoga chanted in his ear. \"Do you think you have gone into a cave for winter quarters? Lo, you have slept now, like the animal for which you take your name! We knew you were exhausted, and that your eyes ached for darkness and oblivion, but we did not know it would take two nights and a day to bring back your wakefulness. Dagaeoga and I were your true friends. We watched over you while you slept out your mighty sleep and kept away from you the bears and panthers that would have devoured you when you knew it not. They came more than once to look at you, and truly the Great Bear is so large that he would have made breakfast, dinner and supper for the hungriest bear or panther that ever roamed the woods.\"  Willet sat up, sleep still heavy on his eyelids, and, for a moment or two, looked dazed.  \"What do you mean, you young rascals?\" he asked. \"You don't say that I've been sleeping here two nights and a day?\"  \"Of course you have,\" replied Robert, \"and I've never seen anybody sleep so hard, either. Look under your blanket and see how your body has actually bored a hole into the ground.\"  Then Willet began to laugh.  \"I see, it's a joke,\" he said, \"though I don't mind. You're good lads, but it was your duty to have awakened me in the night and let me take my part in the watch.\"  \"You were very tired,\" said Robert, \"and we took pity on you. Moreover, the enemy is all about us, and we knew that the watch must be of the best. Tayoga felt that at such a time he could trust me alone, and I felt with equal force that I could trust him alone. We could not put our lives in the hands of a mere beginner.\"  Willet laughed again, and in the utmost good humor.  \"As I repeat, you're sprightly lads,\" he said, \"and I don't mind a jest that all three of us can enjoy. Now, for breakfast, and, truth to say, we must take it cold. It will not do to light another fire.\"  They ate deer meat, drank water from a brook, and then, refreshed greatly by their long rest, started at utmost speed for Fort Refuge, keeping in the deepest shadows of the wilderness, eager to carry the alarm to the garrison, and anxious to avoid any intervening foe. The day was fortunate, no enemy appearing in their path, and they traveled many miles, hope continually rising that they would reach the fort before a cloud of besiegers could arrive.  Thus they continued their journey night and day, seeing many signs of the foe, but not the foe himself, and the hope grew almost into conviction that they would pass all the Indian bands and gain the fort first.     CHAPTER III  THE FLIGHT   They were within twenty-four hours of the fort, when they struck a new trail, one of the many they had seen in the forest, but Tayoga observed it with unusual attention.  \"Why does it interest you so much?\" asked Robert. \"We've seen others like it and you didn't examine them so long.\"  \"This is different, Dagaeoga. Wait a minute or two more that I may observe it more closely.\"  Young Lennox and Willet stood to one side, and the Onondaga, kneeling down in the grass, studied the imprints. It was late in the afternoon, and the light of the red sun fell upon his powerful body, and long, refined, aristocratic face. That it was refined and aristocratic Robert often felt, refined and aristocratic in the highest Indian way. In him flowed the blood of unnumbered chiefs, and, above all, he was in himself the very essence and spirit of a gentleman, one of the finest gentlemen either Robert or Willet had ever known. Tayoga, too, had matured greatly in the last year under the stern press of circumstance. Though but a youth in years he was now, in reality, a great Onondaga warrior, surpassed in skill, endurance and courage by none. Young Lennox and the hunter waited in supreme confidence that he would read the trail and read it right.  Still on his knees, he looked up, and Robert saw the light of discovery in the dusky eyes.  \"What do you read there, Tayoga?\" he asked.  \"Six men have passed here.\"  \"Of what tribe were they?\"  \"That I do not know, save as it concerns one.\"  \"I don't understand you.\"  \"Five were of the Indian race, but of what tribe I cannot say, but the sixth was a white man.\"  \"A Frenchman. It certainly can't be De Courcelles, because we've left him far behind, and I hope it's not St. Luc. Maybe it's Jumonville, De Courcelles' former comrade. Still, it doesn't seem likely that any of the Frenchmen would be with so small a band.\"  \"It is not one of the Frenchmen, and the white man was not with the band.\"  \"Now you're growing too complex for my simple mind, Tayoga. I don't understand you.\"  \"It is one trail, but the Indians and the white man did not pass over it at the same time. The Indian imprints were made seven or eight hours ago, those of the white man but an hour or so since. Stoop down, Great Bear, and you will see that it is true.\"  \"You're right, Tayoga,\" said Willet, after examining minutely.  \"It follows, then,\" said the young Onondaga, in his precise tones, \"that the white man was following the red men.\"  \"It bears that look.\"  \"And you will notice, Great Bear, and you, too, Dagaeoga, that the white man's moccasin has made a very large imprint. The owner of the foot is big. I know of none other in the forest so big except the Great Bear himself.\"  \"Black Rifle!\" exclaimed Robert, with a flash of insight.  \"It can be none other.\"  \"And he's following on the trail of these Indians, intending to ambush them when they camp tonight. He hunts them as we would hunt wolves.\"  Robert shuddered a little. It was a time when human life was held cheap in the wilderness, but he could not bring himself to slay except in self-defense.  \"We need Black Rifle,\" said Willet, \"and they'll need him more at the fort. We've an hour of fair sunlight left, and we must follow this trail as fast as we can and call him back. Lead the way, Tayoga.\"  The young Onondaga, without a word, set out at a running walk, and the others followed close behind. It was a plain trail. Evidently the warriors had no idea that they were followed, and the same was true of Black Rifle. Tayoga soon announced that both pursuers and pursued were going slowly, and, when the last sunlight was fading, they stopped at the crest of a hill and called, imitating first the cry of a wolf, and then the cry of an owl.  \"He can't be more than three or four hundred yards away,\" said Willet, \"and he may not understand either cry, but he's bound to know that they mean something.\"  \"Suppose we stand out here where he can see us,\" said Robert. \"He must be lurking in the thickets just ahead.\"  \"The simplest way and so the right way,\" said Willet. \"Come forth, you lads, where the eyes of Black Rifle may look upon you.\"  The three advanced from the shelter of the woods, and stood clearly outlined in an open space. A whistle came from a thicket scarce a hundred yards before them, and then they saw the striking figure of the great, swarthy man emerging. He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14891"],["title","The Rulers of the Lakes: A Story of George and Champlain (#7)"],["body","straight toward them, and, although he would not show it in his manner, Robert saw a gleam of gladness in the black eyes.  \"What are you doing here, you three?\" he asked.  \"Following you,\" replied Robert in his usual role of spokesman.  \"Why?\"  \"Tayoga saw the trail of the Indians overlaid by yours. We knew you were pursuing them, and we've come to stop you.\"  \"By what right?\"  \"Because you're needed somewhere else. You're to go with us to Fort Refuge.\"  \"What has happened?\"  \"Braddock's army was destroyed near Fort Duquesne. The general and many of his officers were killed. The rest are retreating far into the east. We're on our way to Fort Refuge to save the garrison and people if we can, and you're to go with us.\"  Black Rifle was silent a moment or two. Then he said:  \"I feared Braddock would walk into an ambush, but I hardly believed his army would be annihilated. I don't hold it against him, because he turned my men and me away. How could I when he died with his soldiers?\"  \"He was a brave man,\" said Robert.  \"I'm glad you found me. I'll leave the five Indians, though I could have ambushed 'em within the hour. The whole border must be ablaze, and they'll need us bad at Fort Refuge.\"  The three, now four, slept but little that night and they pressed forward all the next day, their anxiety to reach the fort before an attack could be made, increasing. It did not matter now if they arrived exhausted. The burden of their task was to deliver the word, to carry the warning. At dusk, they were within a few miles of the fort. An hour later they noticed a thread of blue smoke across the clear sky.  \"It comes from the fort,\" said Tayoga.  \"It's not on fire?\" said Robert, aghast.  \"No, Dagaeoga, the fort is not burning. We have come in time. The smoke rises from the chimneys.\"  \"I say so, too,\" said Willet. \"Unless there's a siege on now, we're ahead of the savages.\"  \"There is no siege,\" said Tayoga calmly. \"Tododaho has held the warriors back. Having willed for us to arrive first, nothing could prevent it.\"  \"Again, I think you're right, Tayoga,\" said Robert, \"and now for the fort. Let our feet devour the space that lies between.\"  He was in a mood of high exaltation, and the others shared his enthusiasm. They went faster than ever, and soon they saw rising in the moonlight the strong palisade and the stout log houses within it. Smoke ascended from several chimneys, and, uniting, made the line across the sky that they had beheld from afar. From their distant point of view they could not yet see the sentinels, and it was hard to imagine a more peaceful forest spectacle.  \"At any rate, we can save 'em,\" said Robert.  \"Perhaps,\" said Willet gravely, \"but we come as heralds of disaster occurred, and of hardships to come. It will be a task to persuade them to leave this comfortable place and plunge into the wilderness.\"  \"It's fortunate,\" said Robert, \"that we know Colden and Wilton and Carson and all of them. We warned 'em once when they were coming to the place where the fort now is, and they didn't believe us, but they soon learned better. This time they'll know that we're making no mistake.\"  As they drew near they saw the heads of four sentinels projecting above the walls, one on each side of the square. The forest within rifle shot had also been cleared away, and Black Rifle spoke words of approval.  \"They've learned,\" he said. \"The city lads with the white hands have become men.\"  \"A fine crowd of boys,\" said Willet, with hearty emphasis. \"You'll see 'em acting with promptness and courage. Now, we want to tell 'em we're here without getting a bullet for our pains.\"  \"Suppose you let me hail 'em,\" said Robert. \"I'll stand on the little hill there--a bullet from the palisades can't reach me--and sing 'em a song or two.\"  \"Go ahead,\" said the hunter.  Standing at his full height, young Lennox began to shout:  \"Awake! Awake! Up! Up! We're friends! We're friends!\"  His musical voice had wonderful carrying power, and the forest, and the open space in which the fort stood, rang with the sound. Robert became so much intoxicated with his own chanting that he did not notice its effect, until Willet called upon him to stop.  \"They've heard you!\" exclaimed the hunter. \"Many of them have heard you! All of them must have heard you! Look at the heads appearing above the palisade!\"  The side of the palisade fronting them was lined with faces, some the faces of soldiers and others the faces of civilians. Robert uttered a joyful exclamation.  \"There's Colden!\" he exclaimed. \"The moonlight fell on him just then, and I can't be mistaken.\"  \"And if my eyes tell me true, that's young Wilton beside him,\" said the hunter. \"But come, lads, hold up your hands to show that we're friends, and we'll go into the fort.\"  They advanced, their hands, though they grasped rifles, held on high, but Robert, exalted and irrepressible, began to sing out anew:  \"Hey, you, Colden! And you, too, Wilton and Carson! It's fine to see you again, alive and well.\"  There was silence on the wall, and then a great shout of welcome.  \"It's Lennox, Robert Lennox himself!\" cried someone.  \"And Willet, the big hunter!\"  \"And there's Black Rifle, too!\"  \"And Tayoga, the Onondaga!\"  \"Open the gate for 'em! Let 'em come in, in honor.\"  The great gate was thrown wide, and the four entered quickly, to be surrounded at once by a multitude, eager for news of the outside world, from which they had been shut off so long. Torches, held aloft, cast a flickering light over young soldiers in faded uniforms, men in deerskin, and women in home-made linsey. Colden, and his two lieutenants, Wilton and Carson, stood together. They were thin, and their faces brown, but they looked wiry and rugged. Colden shook Robert's hand with great energy.  \"I'm tremendously glad to see you,\" he exclaimed, \"and I'm equally glad to see Mr. Willet, the great Onondaga, and Black Rifle. You're the first messengers from the outside world in more than a month. What news of victory do you bring? We heard that a great army of ours was marching against Duquesne.\"  Robert did not answer. He could not, because the words choked in his throat, and a silence fell over the crowd gathered in the court, over soldiers and men and women and children alike. A sudden apprehension seized the young commander and his lips trembled.  \"What is it, Lennox, man?\" he exclaimed. \"Why don't you speak? What is it that your eyes are telling me?\"  \"They don't tell of any victory,\" replied Robert slowly.  \"Then what do they tell?\"  \"I'm sorry, Colden, that I have to be the bearer of such news. I would have told it to you privately, but all will have to know it anyhow, and know it soon. There has been a great battle, but we did not win it.\"  \"You mean we had to fall back, or that we failed to advance? But our army will fight again soon, and then it will crush the French and Indian bands!\"  \"General Braddock's army exists no longer.\"  \"What? It's some evil jest. Say it's not true, Lennox!\"  \"It's an evil jest, but it's not mine, Colden. It's the jest of fate. General Braddock walked into a trap--it's twice I've told the terrible tale, once to Black Rifle and now to you--and he and his army were destroyed, all but a fragment of it that is now fleeing from the woods.\"  The full horror of that dreadful scene in the forest returned to him for a moment, and, despite himself, he made tone and manner dramatic. A long, deep gasp, like a groan, came from the crowd, and then Robert heard the sound of a woman on the outskirts weeping.  \"Our army destroyed!\" repeated Colden mechanically.  \"And the whole border is laid bare to the French and Indian hosts,\" said Robert. \"Many bands are converging now upon Fort Refuge, and the place cannot be held against so many.\"  \"You mean abandon Fort Refuge?\"  \"Aye, Colden, it's what wiser men than I say, Dave here, and Tayoga, and Black Rifle.\"  \"The lad is speaking you true, Captain Colden,\" said Willet. \"Not only must you and your garrison and people leave Fort Refuge, but you must leave it tomorrow, and you must burn it, too.\"  Again Robert heard the sound of a woman weeping in the outskirts of the crowd.  \"We held it once against the enemy,\" protested Colden.  \"I know,\" said Willet, \"but you couldn't do it now. A thousand warriors, yes, more, would gather here for the siege, and the French themselves would come with cannon. The big guns would blow your palisades to splinters. Your only safety is in flight. I know it's a hard thing to destroy the fort that your own men built, but the responsibility of all these women and children is upon you, and it must be done.\"  \"So it is, Mr. Willet. I'm not one to gainsay you. I think we can be ready by daylight. Meanwhile you four rest, and I'll have food served to you. You've warned us and we can count upon you now to help us, can't we?\"  \"To the very last,\" said Willet.  After the first grief among the refugees was over the work of preparation was carried on with rapidity and skill, and mostly in silence. There were enough men or well grown boys among the settlers to bring the fighting force up to a hundred. Colden and his assistants knew much of the forest now, and they were willing and anxious, too, to take the advice of older and far more experienced men like Black Rifle and Willet.  \"The fighting spirit bottled up so long in our line has surely ample opportunity to break out in me,\" said Wilton to Robert toward morning. \"As I've told you before, Lennox, if I have any soldierly quality it's no credit of mine. It's a valor suppressed in my Quaker ancestors, but not eradicated.\"  \"That is, if you fight you fight with the sword of your fathers and not your own.\"  \"You put it well, Lennox, better than I could have stated it myself. What has become of that wonderful red friend of yours?\"  \"Tayoga? He has gone into the forest to see how soon we can expect Tandakora, De Courcelles and the Indian host.\"  The Onondaga returned at dawn, saying that no attack need be "]]]
