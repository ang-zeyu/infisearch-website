You see I have given my note, and my paper will be dishonored, if I am not up and doing.\"  \"Your paper!\" said Mrs. Bright, with a smile.  \"That is what Mr. Wing, the boot manufacturer, calls it.\"  \"You needn't go away to earn this money; I can pay it myself.\"  \"This note is my affair, and I mean to pay it myself with my own earnings.  No objections, mother.\"  Like a sensible woman as she was, she did not make any objections.  She was conscious of Bobby's talents; she knew that he had a strong mind of his own, and could take care of himself.  It is true, she feared the influence of the great world, and especially of the great city, upon the tender mind of her son; but if he was never tempted, he would never be a conqueror over the foes that beset him.  She determined to do her whole duty towards him, and she carefully pointed out to him the sins and the moral danger to which he would be exposed, and warned him always to resist temptation.  She counselled him to think of her when he felt like going astray.  Bobby declared that he would try to be a good boy.  He did not speak contemptuously of the anticipated perils, as many boys would have done, because he knew that his mother would not make bugbears out of things which she knew had no real existence.  The next day, Mr. Hardhand came; and my young readers can judge how astonished and chagrined he was, when the widow Bright offered him the sixty dollars.  The Lord was with the widow and the fatherless, and the wretch was cheated out of his revenge.  The note was given up, and the mortgage cancelled.  Mr. Hardhand insisted that she should pay the interest on the sixty dollars for one day, as it was then the second day of July; but when Bobby reckoned it up, and found it was less than one cent, even the wretched miser seemed ashamed of himself, and changed the subject of conversation.  He did not dare to say any thing saucy to the widow this time.  He had lost his power over her, and there stood Bobby, who had come to look just like a young lion to him, coward and knave as he was.  The business was all settled now, and Bobby spent the rest of the week in getting ready for his great enterprise.  He visited all his friends, and went each day to talk with Squire Lee and Annie.  The little maiden promised to buy a great many books of him, if he would bring his stock to Riverdale, for she was quite as much interested in him as her father was.  Monday morning came, and Bobby was out of bed with the first streak of dawn.  The excitement of the great event which was about to happen had not permitted him to sleep for the two hours preceding; yet when he got up, he could not help feeling sad.  He was going to leave the little black house, going to leave his mother, going to leave the children, to depart for the great city.  His mother was up before him.  She was even more sad than he was, for she could see plainer than he the perils that environed him, and her maternal heart, in spite of the reasonable confidence she had in his integrity and good principles, trembled for his safety.  As he ate his breakfast, his mother repeated the warnings and the good lessons she had before imparted.  She particularly cautioned him to keep out of bad company.  If he found that his companions would lie and swear, he might depend upon it they would steal, and he had better forsake them at once.  This was excellent advice, and Bobby had occasion at a later period to call it to his sorrowing heart.  \"Here is three dollars, Bobby; it is all the money I have.  Your fare to Boston will be one dollar, and you will have two left to pay the expenses of your first trip.  It is all I have now,\" said Mrs. Bright.  \"I will not take the whole of it.  You will want it yourself.  One dollar is enough.  When I find Mr. Bayard, I shall do very well.\"  \"Yes, Bobby, take the whole of it.\"  \"I will take just one dollar, and no more,\" replied Bobby, resolutely, as he handed her the other two dollars.  \"Do take it, Bobby.\"  \"No, mother; it will only make me lazy and indifferent.\"  Taking a clean shirt, a pair of socks, and a handkerchief in his bundle, he was ready for a start.  \"Good by, mother,\" said he, kissing her and taking her hand.  \"I shall try and come home on Saturday, so as to be with you on Sunday.\"  Then kissing the children, who had not yet got up, and to whom he had bidden adieu the night before, he left the house.  He had seen the flood of tears that filled his mother's eyes, as he crossed the threshold; and he could not help crying a little himself.  It is a sad thing to leave one's home, one's mother, especially, to go out into the great world; and we need not wonder that Bobby, who had hardly been out of Riverdale before, should weep.  But he soon restrained the flowing tears.  \"Now or never!\" said he, and he put his best foot forward.  It was an epoch in his history, and though he was too young to realize the importance of the event, he seemed to feel that what he did now was to give character to his whole future life.  It was a bright and beautiful morning--somehow, it is always a bright and beautiful morning when boys leave their homes to commence the journey of life; it is typical of the season of youth and hope, and it is meet that the sky should be clear, and the sun shine brightly, when the little pilgrim sets out upon his tour.  He will see clouds and storms before he has gone far--let him have a fair start.  He had to walk five miles to the nearest railroad station.  His road lay by the house of his friend, Squire Lee; and as he was approaching it, he met Annie.  She said she had come out to take her morning walk; but Bobby knew very well that she did not usually walk till an hour later; which, with the fact that she had asked him particularly, the day before, what time he was going, made Bobby believe that she had come out to say good by, and bid him God speed on his journey.  At any rate, he was very glad to see her.  He said a great many pretty things to her, and talked so big about what he was going to do, that the little maiden could hardly help laughing in his face.  Then at the house he shook hands with the squire and shook hands again with Annie, and resumed his journey.  His heart felt lighter for having met them, or at least for having met one of them, if not both; for Annie's eyes were so full of sunshine that they seemed to gladden his heart, and make him feel truer and stronger.  After a pleasant walk, for he scarcely heeded the distance, so full was he of his big thoughts, he reached the railroad station.  The cars had not yet arrived, and would not for half an hour.  \"Why should I give them a dollar for carrying me to Boston, when I can just as well walk?  If I get tired, I can sit down and rest me.  If I save the dollar, I shall have to earn only fifty-nine more to pay my note.  So here goes;\" and he started down the track.     CHAPTER VII.  IN WHICH BOBBY STANDS UP FOR \"CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS.\"  Whether it was wise policy, or \"penny wise and pound foolish\" policy for Bobby to undertake such a long walk, is certainly a debatable question; but as my young readers would probably object to an argument, we will follow him to the city, and let every one settle the point to suit himself.  His cheerful heart made the road smooth beneath his feet.  He had always been accustomed to an active, busy life, and had probably often walked more than twenty miles in a day.  About ten o'clock, though he did not feel much fatigued, he seated himself on a rock by a brook from which he had just taken a drink, to rest himself.  He had walked slowly so as to husband his strength; and he felt confident that he should be able to accomplish the journey without injury to himself.  After resting for half an hour, he resumed his walk.  At twelve o'clock he reached a point from which he obtained his first view of the city. His heart bounded at the sight, and his first impulse was to increase his speed so that he should the sooner gratify his curiosity; but a second thought reminded him that he had eaten nothing since breakfast; so, finding a shady tree by the road side, he seated himself on a stone to eat the luncheon which his considerate mother had placed in his bundle.  Thus refreshed, he felt like a new man, and continued his journey again till he was on the very outskirts of the city, where a sign, \"No passing over this bridge,\" interrupted his farther progress.  Unlike many others, Bobby took this sign literally, and did not venture to cross the bridge.  Having some doubts as to the direct road to the city, he hailed a man in a butcher's cart, who not only pointed the way, but gave him an invitation to ride with him, which Bobby was glad to accept.  They crossed the Milldam, and the little pilgrim forgot the long walk he had taken--forgot Riverdale, his mother, Squire Lee, and Annie, for the time, in the absorbing interest of the exciting scene.  The Common beat Riverdale Common all hollow; he had never seen any thing like it before.  But when the wagon reached Washington Street, the measure of his surprise was filled up.  \"My gracious! how thick the houses are!\" exclaimed he, much to the amusement of the kind-hearted butcher.  \"We have high fences here,\" he replied.  \"Where are all these folks going to?\"  \"You will have to ask them, if you want to know.\"  But the wonder soon abated, and Bobby began to think of his great mission in the city.  He got tired of gazing and wondering, and even began to smile with contempt at the silly fops as they sauntered along, and the gayly-dressed ladies, that flaunted like so many idle butterflies, on the sidewalk.  It was an exciting scene; but it did not look real to him.  It was more like Herr Grunderslung's exhibition of the magic lantern, than any thing substantial.  The men and women were like so many puppets.  They did not seem to be doing any thing, or to be walking for any purpose.  He got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14762"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright: A Story for Young Folks (#7)"],["body","of the butcher's cart at the Old South.  His first impression, as he joined the busy throng, was, that he was one of the puppets.  He did not seem to have any hold upon the scene, and for several minutes this sensation of vacancy chained him to the spot.  \"All right!\" exclaimed he to himself at last.  \"I am here.  Now's my time to make a strike.  Now or never.\"  He pulled Mr. Bayard's card from his pocket, and fixed the number of his store in his mind.  Now, numbers were not a Riverdale institution, and Bobby was a little perplexed about finding the one indicated.  A little study into the matter, however, set him right, and he soon had the satisfaction of seeing the bookseller's name over his store.  \"F. Bayard,\" he read; \"this is the place.\"  \"Country!\" shouted a little ragged boy, who dodged across the street at that moment.  \"Just so, my beauty!\" said Bobby, a little nettled at this imputation of verdancy.  \"What a greeny!\" shouted the little vagabond from the other side of the street.  \"No matter, rag-tag!  We'll settle that matter some other time.\"  But Bobby felt that there was something in his appearance which subjected him to the remarks of others, and as he entered the shop, he determined to correct it as soon as possible.  A spruce young gentleman was behind the counter, who cast a mischievous glance at him as he entered.  \"Mr. Bayard keep here?\" asked Bobby.  \"Well, I reckon he does.  How are all the folks up country?\" replied the spruce clerk, with a rude grin.  \"How are they?\" repeated Bobby, the color flying to his cheek.  \"Yes, ha-ow do they dew?\"  \"They behave themselves better than they do here.\"  \"Eh, greeny?\"  \"Eh, sappy?\" repeated Bobby, mimicking the soft, silky tones of the young city gentleman.  \"What do you mean by sappy?\" asked the clerk, indignantly.  \"What do you mean by greeny?\"  \"I'll let you know what I mean!\"  \"When you do, I'll let you know what I mean by sappy.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed one of the salesmen, who had heard part of this spirited conversation.  \"You will learn better by and by, Timmins, than to impose upon boys from out of town.\"  \"You seem to be a gentleman, sir,\" said Bobby, approaching the salesman. \"I wish to see Mr. Bayard.\"  \"You can't see him!\" growled Timmins.  \"Can't I?\"  \"Not at this minute; he is engaged just now,\" added the salesman, who seemed to have a profound respect for Bobby's discrimination.  \"He will be at liberty in a few moments.\"  \"I will wait, then,\" said Bobby, seating himself on a stool by the counter.  Pretty soon the civil gentleman left the store to go to dinner, and Timmins, a little timid about provoking the young lion, cast an occasional glance of hatred at him. He had evidently found that \"Country\" was an embryo American citizen, and that he was a firm believer in the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.  Bobby bore no ill will towards the spruce clerk, ready as he had been to defend his \"certain inalienable rights.\"  \"You do a big business here,\" suggested Bobby, in a conciliatory tone, and with a smile on his face which ought to have convinced the uncourteous clerk that he meant well.  \"Who told you so?\" replied Timmins, gruffly.  \"I merely judged from appearances.  You have a big store, and an immense quantity of books.\"  \"Appearances are deceitful,\" replied Timmins; and perhaps he had been impressed by the fact from his experience with the lad from the country.  \"That is true,\" added Bobby, with a good-natured smile, which, when interpreted, might have meant, \"I took you for a civil fellow, but I have been very much mistaken.\"  \"You will find it out before you are many days older.\"  \"The book business is good just now, isn't it?\" continued Bobby, without clearly comprehending the meaning of the other's last remark.  \"Humph!  What's that to you?\"  \"O, I intend to go into it myself.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!  Good!  You do?\"  \"I do,\" replied Bobby, seemingly unconcerned at the taunts of the clerk.  \"I suppose you want to get a place here,\" sneered Timmins, alarmed at the prospect.  \"But let me tell you, you can't do it.  Bayard has all the help he wants; and if that is what you come for, you can move on as fast as you please.\"  \"I guess I will see him,\" added Bobby quietly.  \"No use.\"  \"No harm in seeing him.\"  As he spoke he took up a book that lay on the counter, and began to turn over the leaves.  \"Put that book down!\" said the amiable Mr. Timmins.  \"I won't hurt it,\" replied Bobby, who had just fixed his eye upon some very pretty engravings in the volume.  \"Put it down!\" repeated Mr. Timmins, in a loud, imperative tone.  \"Certainly I will, if you say so,\" said Bobby, who, though not much intimidated by the harsh tones of the clerk, did not know the rules of the store, and deemed it prudent not to meddle.  \"I _do_ say so!\" added Mr. Timmins, magnificently; \"and what's more, you'd better mind me, too.\"  Bobby had minded, and probably the stately little clerk would not have been so bold if he had not.  Some people like to threaten after the danger is over.  Then our visitor from the country espied some little blank books lying on the counter.  He had already made up his mind to have one, in which to keep his accounts; and he thought, while he was waiting, that he would purchase one.  He meant to do things methodically; so when he picked up one of the blank books, it was with the intention of buying it.  \"Put that book down!\" said Mr. Timmins, encouraged in his aggressive intentions by the previous docility of our hero.  \"I want to buy one.\"  \"No, you don't: put it down.\".  \"What is the price of these?\" asked Bobby, resolutely.  \"None of your business!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  IN WHICH MR. TIMMINS IS ASTONISHED, AND BOBBY DINES IN CHESTNUT STREET.  It was Mr. Bayard.  He had finished his business with the gentleman by his side, and hearing the noise of the scuffle, had come to learn the occasion of it.  \"This impudent young puppy wouldn't let the books alone!\" began Mr. Timmins.  \"I threatened to turn him out if he didn't; and I meant to make good my threat.  I think he meant to steal something.\"  Bobby was astonished and shocked at this bold imputation; but he wished to have his case judged on its own merits; so he turned his face away, that Mr. Bayard might not recognize him.  \"I wanted to buy one of these blank books,\" added Bobby, picking up the one he had dropped on the floor in the struggle.  \"All stuff!\" ejaculated Timmins.  \"He is an impudent, obstinate puppy! In my opinion he meant to steal that book.\"  \"I asked him the price, and told him I wanted to buy it,\" added Bobby, still averting his face.  \"Well, I told him; and he said it was too high.\"  \"He asked me twenty-five cents for it.\"  \"Is this true, Timmins?\" asked Mr. Bayard, sternly.  \"No, sir, I told him fourpence,\" replied Timmins boldly.  \"By gracious!  What a whopper!\" exclaimed Bobby, startled out of his propriety by this monstrous lie.  \"He said twenty-five cents; and I told him I could buy one up in Riverdale, where I came from, for six cents.  Can you deny that?\"  \"It's a lie!\" protested Timmins.  \"Riverdale,\" said Mr. Bayard.  \"Are you from Riverdale, boy?\"  \"Yes, sir, I am; and if you will look on your memorandum book you will find my name there.\"  \"Bless me!  I am sure I have seen that face before,\" exclaimed Mr. Bayard, as he grasped the hand of Bobby, much to the astonishment and consternation of Mr. Timmins.  You are--\"  \"Robert Bright, sir.\"  \"My brave little fellow!  I am heartily glad to see you;\" and the bookseller shook the hand he held with hearty good will.  \"I was thinking of you only a little while ago.\"  \"This fellow calls me a liar,\" said Bobby, pointing to the astonished Mr. Timmins, who did not know what to make of the cordial reception which \"Country\" was receiving from his employer.  \"Well, Robert, we know that he is a liar; this is not the first time he has, been caught in a lie.  Timmins, your time is out.\"  The spruce clerk hung his head with shame and mortification.  \"I hope, sir, you will--\" he began, but pride or fear stopped him short.  \"Don't be hard with him, sir, if you please,\" said Bobby.  \"I suppose I aggravated him.\"  Mr. Bayard looked at the gentleman who stood by his side, and a smile of approbation lighted up his face.  \"Generous as he is noble!  Butler, this is the boy that saved Ellen.\"  \"Indeed!  He is a little giant!\" replied Mr. Butler, grasping Bobby's hand.  Even Timmins glanced with something like admiration in his looks at the youth whom he had so lately despised.  Perhaps, too, he thought of that Scripture wisdom about entertaining angels unawares.  He was very much abashed, and nothing but his silly pride prevented him from acknowledging his error, and begging Bobby's forgiveness.  \"I can't have a liar about me,\" said Mr. Bayard.  \"There may be some mistake,\" suggested Mr. Butler.  \"I think not.  Robert Bright couldn't lie.  So brave and noble a boy is incapable of a falsehood.  Besides, I got a letter from my friend Squire Lee by this morning's mail, in which he informed me of my young friend's coming.\"  Mr. Bayard took from his pocket a bundle of letters, and selected the squire's from among them.  Opening it, he read a passage which had a direct bearing upon the case before him.  \"'I do not know what Bobby's faults are,'\"--the letter said,--\"'but this I do know: that Bobby would rather be whipped than tell a lie.  He is noted through the place for his love of truth.'--That is pretty strong testimony; and you see, Bobby,--that's what the squire calls you,--your reputation has preceded you.\"  Bobby blushed, as he always did when he was praised, and Mr. Timmins was more abashed than ever.  \"Did you hear that, Timmins?  Who is the liar now?\" said Mr. Bayard, turning to the culprit.  \"Forgive me, sir, this time.  If you turn me off now, I cannot get another place, and my mother depends upon my wages.\"  \"You ought to have thought of this before.\"  \"He aggravated me, sir, so that I wanted to pay him off.\"  \"As to "]]]
