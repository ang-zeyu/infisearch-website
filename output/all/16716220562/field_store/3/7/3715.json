A large wave upset the boat, and they were all thrown into the water. Think of James Brown, the truant, at this time! 10. He was far from home, known by no one. His parents were ignorant of his danger.   THIRD READER.  29 He was struggling in the water, on the point of being drowned. 11. Some men, however, saw the boys, and went out to them in a boat. They reached them just in time to save them from a watery grave. 12. They were taken into a house, where their clothes were dried. After a while, they were sent home to their parents. 13. James was very sorry for his conduct, and he was never known to be guilty of the same thing again. 14. He became regular at school, learned to attend to his books, and, above all, to obey his parents perfectly.  LESSON VIII.    THE WHITE KITTEN.  1.  My little white kitten's asleep on my knee; As white as the snow or the lilies is she;     She wakes up with a pur     When I stroke her soft fur: Was there ever another white kitten like her?   30  ECLECTIC SERIES.  2.  My little white kitten now wants to go out And frolic, with no one to watch her about;     \"Little kitten,\" I say,    \"Just an hour you may stay, And be careful in choosing your places to play.\"    3. But night has come down, when I hear a loud \"mew;\" I open the door, and my kitten comes through;     My white kitten! ah me!     Can it really be she-- This ill-looking, beggar-like cat that I see?  4. What ugly, gray streaks on her side and her back! Her nose, once as pink as a rosebud, is black!     Oh, I very well know,     Though she does not say so, She has been where white kittens ought never to go.    THIRD READER.  31  5. If little good children intend to do right, If little white kittens would keep themselves white,     It is needful that they     Should this counsel obey, And be careful in choosing their places to play.  LESSON IX.   THE BEAVER.  1. The beaver is found chiefly in North America. It is about three and a half feet long, including the flat, paddle- shaped tail, which is a foot in length. 2. The long, shining hair on the back is chestnut-colored, while the fine, soft fur that lies next the skin, is grayish brown. 3. Beavers build themselves most curious huts to live in, and quite frequently a great number of these huts are placed close together, like the buildings in a town. 4. They always build their huts on the banks of rivers or lakes, for they swim much   32  ECLECTIC SERIES. more easily than they walk, and prefer moving about in the water. 5. When they build on the bank of a running stream, they make a dam across the stream for the purpose of keeping the water at the height they wish. 6. These dams are made chiefly of mud, and stones, and the branches of trees. They are sometimes six or seven hundred feet in length, and are so constructed that they look more like the work of man than of little dumb beasts. 7. Their huts are made of the same material as the dams, and are round in shape. The walls are very thick, and the roofs are finished off with a thick layer of mud, sticks, and leaves. 8. They commence building their houses late in the summer, but do not get them finished before the early frosts. The freezing makes them tighter and stronger. 9. They obtain the wood for their dams and huts by gnawing through the branches of trees, and even through the trunks of small ones, with their sharp front teeth. They peel off the bark, and lay it up in store for winter food.   THIRD READER.  33 10. The fur of the beaver is highly prized. The men who hunt these animals are called trappers. 11. A gentleman once saw five young beavers playing. They would leap on the trunk of a tree that lay near a beaver dam, and would push one another off into the water.  12. He crept forward very cautiously, and was about to fire on the little creatures; but their amusing tricks reminded him so much of some little children he knew at home, that he thought it would be inhuman to kill them. So he left them without even disturbing their play.  3,3   34  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON X.    THE YOUNG TEACHER.  1. Charles Rose lived in the country with his father, who taught him to read and to write. 2. Mr. Rose told his son that, when his morning lessons were over, he might amuse himself for one hour as he pleased. 3. There was a river near by. On its bank stood the hut of a poor fisherman, who lived by selling fish. 4. His careful wife kept her wheel going early and late. They both worked very hard to keep themselves above want. 5. But they were greatly troubled lest their only son should never learn to read and to write. They could not teach him themselves, and they were too poor to send him to school. 6. Charles called at the hut of this fisherman one day, to inquire about his dog, which was missing.    THIRD READER.  35 7. He found the little boy, whose name was Joe, sitting by the table, on which he was making marks with a piece of chalk. Charles asked him whether he was drawing pictures.  8. \"No, I am trying to write,\" said little Joe, \"but I know only two words. Those I saw upon a sign, and I am trying to write them.\" 9. \"If I could only learn to read and write,\" said he, \"I should be the happiest boy in the world.\"   36  ECLECTIC SERIES. 10. \"Then I will make you happy,\" said Charles. \"I am only a little boy, but I can teach you that. 11. \"My father gives me an hour every day for myself. Now, if you will try to learn, you shall soon know how to read and to write.\" 12. Both Joe and his mother were ready to fall on their knees to thank Charles. They told him it was what they wished above all things. 13. So, on the next day when the hour came, Charles put his book in his pocket, and went to teach Joe. Joe learned very fast, and Charles soon began to teach him how to write. 14. Some time after, a gentleman called on Mr. Rose, and asked him if he knew where Charles was. Mr. Rose said that he was taking a walk, he supposed. 15. \"I am afraid,\" said the gentleman, \"that he does not always amuse himself thus. I often see him go to the house of the fisherman. I fear he goes out in their boat.\" 16. Mr. Rose was much troubled. He had told Charles that he must never venture on the river, and he thought he could trust him.    THIRD READER.  37 17. The moment the gentleman left, Mr. Rose went in search of his son. He went to the river, and walked up and down, in hope of seeing the boat. 18. Not seeing it, he grew uneasy. He thought Charles must have gone a long way off. Unwilling to leave without learning something of him, he went to the hut. 19. He put his head in at the window, which was open. There a pleasant sight met his eyes. 20. Charles was at the table, ruling a copybook Joe was reading to him, while his mother was spinning in the corner. 21. Charles was a little confused. He feared his father might not be pleased; but he had no need to be uneasy, for his father was delighted. 22. The next day, his father took him to town, and gave him books for himself and Joe, with writing paper, pens, and ink. 23. Charles was the happiest boy in the world when he came home. He ran to Joe, his hands filled with parcels, and his heart beating with joy.   38  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XI.    THE BLACKSMITH.  1. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! We begin to hammer at morning's blink, And hammer away Till the busy day, Like us, aweary, to rest shall sink.  2. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! From labor and care we never will shrink; But our fires we'll blow Till our forges glow With light intense, while our eyelids wink.    THIRD READER.  39  3. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink; The chain we'll forge with many a link. We'll work each form While the iron is warm, With strokes as fast as we can think.  4. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! Our faces may be as black as ink, But our hearts are true As man ever knew, And kindly of all we shall ever think.  LESSON XII.    A WALK IN THE GARDEN.  1. Frank was one day walking with his mother, when they came to a pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had clean gravel walks, and beds of beautiful flowers all in bloom. 2. He called to his mother, and said, \"Mother, come and look at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and walk in.\"   40  ECLECTIC SERIES. 3. The gardener, being near, heard what Frank said, and kindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden. 4. Frank's mother thanked the man. Turning to her son, she said, \"Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you must take care not to meddle with anything in it.\"  5. Frank walked along the neat gravel paths, and looked at everything, but touched nothing that he saw. 6. He did not tread on any of the borders, and was careful that his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers, lest he might break them.    THIRD READER.  41 7. The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he was so careful not to do mischief. He showed him the seeds, and told him the name of many of the flowers and plants. 8. While Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a boy came to the gate, and finding it locked, he shook it hard. But it would not open. Then he said, \"Let me in; let me in; will you not let me in this garden?\" 9. \"No, indeed,\" said the gardener, \"I will not let you in, I assure you; for when I let you in yesterday, you meddled with my flowers, and pulled some of my rare fruit. I do not choose to let a boy into my garden who meddles with the plants.\" 10. The boy looked ashamed, and when he found that the gardener would not let him in, he went slowly away. 11. Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by not meddling with what does not belong to him. 12. He and his mother then continued their walk in the garden, and enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the gardener gave each of them some pretty flowers.  42  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XIII.   THE WOLF. 1. A boy was once taking care of some sheep, not far from a forest. Near by was a village,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],["title","McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#3)"],["body","he was told to call for help if there was any danger. 2. One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out, with all his might, \"The wolf is coming! the wolf is coming!\" 3. The men came running with clubs and axes to destroy the wolf. As they saw nothing they went home again, and left John laughing in his sleeve. 4. As he had had so much fun this time, John cried out again, the next day, \"The wolf! the wolf!\" 5. The men came again, but not so many as the first time. Again they saw no trace of the wolf; so they shook their heads, and went back. 6. On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in dismay, \"Help! help!   THIRD READER.  43 the wolf! the wolf!\" But not a single man came to help him. 7. The wolf broke into the flock, and killed  a great many sheep. Among them was a beautiful lamb, which belonged to John. 8. Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends and neighbors, and grieved over the loss of his pet lamb.  The truth itself is not believed, From one who often has deceived.  44  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XIV.     THE LITTLE BIRD'S SONG.  1. A little bird, with feathers brown, Sat singing on a tree; The song was very soft and low, But sweet as it could be.  2. The people who were passing by, Looked up to see the bird   THIRD READER.  45  That made the sweetest melody That ever they had heard. 3. But all the bright eyes looked in vain; Birdie was very small, And with his modest, dark-brown coat, He made no show at all. 4. \"Why, father,\" little Gracie said \"Where can the birdie be? If  I could sing a song like that, I'd sit where folks could see.\" 5. \"I hope my little girl will learn A lesson from the bird, And try to do what good she can, Not to be seen or heard. 6. \"This birdie is content to sit Unnoticed on the way, And sweetly sing his Maker's praise From dawn to close of day. 7. \"So live, my child, all through your life, That, be it short or long, Though others may forget your looks, They'll not forget your song.\"  46  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XV.     HARRY AND ANNIE. 1. Harry and Annie lived a mile from town, but they went there to school every day. It was a pleasant walk down the lane, and through the meadow by the pond. 2. I hardly know whether they liked it better in summer or in winter. They used to pretend that they were travelers exploring a new country, and would scatter leaves on   THIRD READER.  47 the road that they might find their way back again. 3. When the ice was thick and firm, they went across the pond. But their mother did not like to have them do this unless some one was with them. 4. \"Do n't go across the pond to-day, children,\" she said, as she kissed them and bade them good-by one morning; \"it is beginning to thaw.\" 5. \"All right, mother,\" said Harry, not very good- naturedly, for he was very fond of running and sliding on the ice. When they came to the pond, the ice looked hard and safe. 6. \"There,\" said he to his sister, \"I knew it had n't thawed any. Mother is always afraid we shall be drowned. Come along, we will have a good time sliding. The school bell will not ring for an hour at least.\" 7.  \"But you promised mother,\" said Annie. 8.  \"No, I did n't. I only said 'All right,' and it is all right.\" 9. \"I did n't say anything; so I can do as I like,\" said Annie. 10. So they stepped on the ice, and started to go across the pond. They had not gone    48  ECLECTIC SERIES. far before the ice gave way, and they fell into the water. 11. A man who was at work near the shore, heard the screams of the children, and plunged into the water to save them. Harry managed to get to the shore without any help, but poor Annie was nearly drowned before the man could reach her. 12. Harry went home almost frozen, and told his mother how disobedient he had been. He remembered the lesson learned that day as long as he lived.  LESSON XVI.   BIRD FRIENDS. 1. I once knew a man who was rich in his love for birds, and in their love for him. He lived in the midst of a grove full of all kinds of trees. He had no wife or children in his home. 2. He was an old man with gray beard, blue and kind eyes, and a voice that the   THIRD READER.  49 birds loved; and this was the way he made them his friends. 3. While he was at work with a rake on his nice walks in the grove, the birds came  close to him to pick up the worms in the fresh earth he dug up. At first, they kept a rod or two from him, but they soon found he was a kind man, and would not hurt them, but liked to have them near him. 3. 4.   50  ECLECTIC SERIES. 4. They knew this by his kind eyes and voice, which tell what is in the heart. So, day by day their faith in his love grew in them. 5. They came close to the rake. They would hop on top of it to be first at the worm. They would turn up their eyes into his when he spoke to them, as if they said, \"He is a kind man; he loves us; we need not fear him.\" 6. All the birds of the grove were soon his fast friends. They were on the watch for him, and would fly down from the green tree tops to greet him with their chirp. 7. When he had no work on the walks to do with his rake or his hoe, he took crusts of bread with him, and dropped the crumbs on the ground. Down they would dart on his head and feet to catch them as they fell from his hand. 8  He showed me how they loved him. He put a crust of bread in his mouth, with one end of it out of his lips. Down they came like bees at a flower, and flew off with it crumb by crumb. 9. When they thought he slept too long in the morning, they would fly in and sit   THIRD READER.  51 on the bedpost, and call him up with their chirp. 10. They went with him to church, and while he said his prayers and sang his hymns in it, they sat in the trees, and sang their praises to the same good God who cares for them as he does for us. 11. Thus the love and trust of birds were a joy to him all his life long; and such love and trust no boy or girl can fail to win with the same kind heart, voice, and eye that he had.  Adapted from Elihu Burritt.    LESSON XVII.  WHAT THE MINUTES SAY.  1.  We are but minutes--little things! Each one furnished with sixty wings, With which we fly on our unseen track, And not a minute ever comes back.  2.  We are but minutes; use us well, For how we are used we must one day tell. Who uses minutes, has hours to use; Who loses minutes, whole years must lose.   52  ECLECTIC SERIES  LESSON XVIII.     THE WIDOW AND THE MERCHANT. 1. A merchant, who was very fond of music, was asked by a poor widow to give her some assistance. Her husband, who was a musician, had died, and left her very poor indeed. 2. The merchant saw that the widow and her daughter, who was with her, were in great   THIRD READER.  53 distress. He looked with pity into their pale faces, and was convinced by their conduct that their sad story was true. 3. \"How much do you want, my good woman?\" said the merchant. 4. \"Five dollars will save us,\" said the poor widow, with some hesitation. 5. The merchant sat down at his desk, took a piece of paper, wrote a few lines on it, and gave it to the widow with the words, \"Take it to the bank you see on the other side of the street.\" 6. The grateful widow and her daughter, without stopping to read the note, hastened to the bank. The banker at once counted out fifty dollars instead of five, and passed them to the widow. 7. She was amazed when she saw so much money. \"Sir, there is a mistake here,\" she said. \"You have given me fifty dollars, and I asked for only five.\" 8. The banker looked at the note once more, and said, \"The check calls for fifty dollars.\" 9. \"It is a mistake--indeed it is,\" said the widow. 10. The banker then asked her to wait   54  ECLECTIC SERIES. a few minutes, while he went to see the merchant who gave her the note. 11. \"Yes.\" said the merchant, when he had heard the banker's story, \"I did make a mistake. I wrote fifty instead of five hundred. Give the poor widow five hundred dollars, for such honesty is poorly rewarded with even that sum.\" LESSON XIX.  THE BIRDS SET FREE. 1. A man was walking one day through a large city. On a street corner he saw a boy with a number of small birds for sale, in a cage. 2. He looked with sadness upon the little prisoners flying about the cage, peeping through the wires, beating them with their wings, and trying to get out. 3. He stood for some time looking at the birds. At last he said to the boy, \"How much do you ask for your birds?\"   THIRD READER.  55 4. \"Fifty cents apiece, sir,\" said the boy. \"I do not mean how much apiece,\" said the man, \"but how much for all of them? I want to buy them all.\" 5. The boy began to count, and found they came to five dollars. \"There is your money,\"  said the man. The boy took it, well pleased with his morning's trade. 6. No sooner was the bargain settled than the man opened the cage door, and let all the birds fly away. 7. The boy, in great surprise, cried, \"What did you do that for, sir? You have lost all your birds.\"   56  ECLECTIC SERIES. 8. \"I will tell you why I did it,\" said the man. \"I was shut up three years in a French prison, as a prisoner of war, and I am resolved never to see anything in prison which I can make free.\" LESSON XX.   A MOMENT TOO LATE.  1. A moment too late, my beautiful bird, A moment too late are you now; The wind has your soft, downy nest disturbed-- The nest that you hung on the bough.  2. A moment too late; that string in your bill, Would have fastened it firmly and strong; But see, there it goes, rolling over the hill! Oh, you staid a moment too long.  3. A moment, one moment too late, busy bee; The honey has dropped from the flower: No use to creep under the petals and see; It stood ready to drop for an hour.  4. A moment too late; had you sped on your wing, The honey would not have been gone;   THIRD READER.  57  Now you see what a very, a very sad thing  'T is to stay a moment too long.  5. Little girl, never be a moment too late, It will soon end in trouble or crime; Better be an hour early, and stand and"]]]
