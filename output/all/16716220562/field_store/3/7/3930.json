Captain Sedley, who watched over the welfare of the club with paternal interest, had endeavored, during the winter that was now past, to render it effectual in developing the moral and mental capacities of the members. He had given such a direction to the exercises in Zephyr Hall as he thought would best attain this end. One of the greatest difficulties with which he had been obliged to contend was the want of individuality in the boys. Each was disposed to \"pin his faith\" upon others. They would not think for themselves, and exercise an independent judgment. Like thousands in the great world, they \"went with the crowd;\" thought, acted, voted, with the majority.  Frank saw the operation of this motive in the \"informal vote\" which had just been taken; and he was tolerably certain that he could bring them all over to the other side, by indicating his own preference.  Calling Fred Harper to the chair again, he opened the discussion by offering a simile, which, being a parallel case, certainly gave the question an entirely new aspect.  \"At the Rippleton Academy three gold medals and three silver medals are awarded, every year, for the best scholarship and deportment. Is that gambling?\"  \"No,\" replied half a dozen voices.  \"Well, we are to row, in like manner for a prize. We don't put up money as a stake; the party that gets beaten does not lose anything.\"  \"That makes a difference,\" added Charles.  \"But the prizes in the Academy are given to make the scholars get their lessons well--to stimulate them in doing their duty,\" said William Bright.  \"Very true;\" and Frank saw, in the faces of the members, that the current had again set in another direction. \"But we only want to prove that rowing for the prize is not gambling.\"  \"That's all,\" said Charles.  \"The Agricultural Society offers premiums for the best horses, cows, oxen.\"  \"That's to improve stock,\" answered William. \"Boat racing can only be for amusement.\"  \"The Horticultural Society gives premiums for the prettiest flowers,\" added Frank; \"and my father got one of them last summer.\"  The boys were staggered again.  \"Flowers are cultivated for amusement; at any rate, we don't eat them, or drink them, or sleep on them,\" continued Frank.    \"Your bed shall be roses, besprinkled with dew.\"  added Fred, who never missed his joke. \"Besides, we sleep on poppies. They are a sleepy plant, you know.\"  \"But the real question,\" said Frank, \"is, whether racing for a prize will not excite hard and envious feelings in the members of the two clubs. I hope we shall think well of it before we vote; and for that purpose, Mr. Chairman, I move a recess of half an hour.\"  The motion was carried, and the boys talked the matter over till the meeting was called to order again.  \"Question!\" called several voices.  The vote was immediately taken, and it stood nine in favor and two opposed to the proposition. And so, on the part of the Zephyr, the offer was accepted.  The club then adjourned for an excursion on the lake.     CHAPTER III.  ALL ABOARD!   The club had taken their seats in the boat, and were waiting the orders of the coxswain to haul her out of her berth, when Captain Sedley made his appearance.  \"You are short-handed, Frank,\" said he, as he observed Tony's vacant seat.  \"Yes, sir; but we have elected a member to fill that place,\" replied Frank, as he jumped out of the boat, and hastened to inform his father of what the club had done.  The members all felt a deep interest in the result of this conference; and though this was the first excursion of the season, they forgot for the time the pleasure before them in their desire to know whether the \"director\" would approve their action in relation to the new member and the prize.  Frank and his father entered the club-room together.  \"Now, my son, what have you done?\" asked Captain Sedley.  \"We have discussed both questions to the best of our ability,\" replied Frank, with some hesitation.  \"Well, what was the result?\"  \"We have elected Tim to fill Tony's place.\"  \"Indeed!\"  \"We have; and we await your sanction to our doings.\"  \"Did you think I would sanction such a choice as that?\"  \"I didn't know. We have fairly considered the matter; have faithfully examined both sides of the question. If we have done wrong, you know, father, that you have a veto upon our doings.\"  Captain Sedley smiled at the matter-of-fact, business-like earnestness of his son. He felt quite as much interest in the action of the boys as they did to learn his opinion of it.  \"Tim is a very bad boy,\" said he.  \"He _was_; but he has solemnly promised to amend, and become a good boy,\" answered Frank, warmly.  \"Not much dependence can be placed upon the promises of such boys as Tim.\"  \"But if no one encourages him to become better, he will not be likely to improve much, especially when everybody despises and shuns him.\"  \"There is danger that he may corrupt the rest of the club.\"  \"He must obey the requirements of the constitution, or he cannot long continue to be a member.\"  \"You are right, Frank; I approve your action in this matter, but I should like to know the grounds upon which you admitted him.\"  Frank gave him a brief synopsis of the debate, and the anxious father expressed himself well pleased with the liberal views of the club.  \"Men might be oftener reformed in the great world, if people would only give them a chance to be respectable, as you have done with Tim,\" said Captain Sedley. \"But what have you done about the prize?\"  \"We have voted to accept the offer of the gentlemen,\" answered Frank, rather doubtfully, as he looked earnestly into the face of his father, to discover the effect of his intelligence.  \"I hope you looked on both sides of this question, as well as the other.\"  \"We did, father.\"  Frank stated the different opinions that had been expressed by the members during the debate, and the fact that they had informally given a unanimous vote against it. Captain Sedley was much amused by the narration, in spite of the disappointment he felt at the ill success of his efforts to make the boys reason for themselves.  \"I think your view is correct, Frank; though I am aware that many mature minds would arrive at a different conclusion. As you say, the envy and ill will which the contest may excite are the evils most to be dreaded.\"  \"Then you approve our decision?\"  \"I do.\"  Frank felt as happy at that moment as though he had been a general of division, and had won a great victory. The consciousness of having arrived, unaided by mature minds, at a correct conclusion, was a triumph in itself. He had exercised his thought, and it had borne him to a right judgment. He was proud of his achievement, and hastened back to the boat with the intelligence of the approval.  \"What does he say?\" asked half a dozen of the members.  \"Let us get off first, and then we will talk about it,\" replied Frank. \"Bowman, let go the painter; cast off the stern lines, there. Now, back her--steady.\"  \"Tell us about it, Frank,\" said Charles Hardy, as the Zephyr glided clear of the boat-house, out upon the deep waters of the lake.  \"Ready--up!\" continued Frank, and the eleven oars were poised perpendicularly in the air.  \"Down!\"  The members had already begun to feel the inspiration of their favorite amusement, and there appeared to have been nothing lost by the season of inactivity which had passed away. They were as prompt and as perfect in the drill as though they had practised it every day during the winter. Although it was a moment of excitement, there was no undue haste; every member seemed to be perfectly cool.  \"Ready--pull!\"  And the broad blades dipped in the water, and bent before the vigorous arms of the youthful oarsmen.  \"Starboard oars, cease rowing--back!\" continued the coxswain, with admirable dignity and self-possession; and the Zephyr, acted upon by this maneuver, came about as though upon a pivot, without going either backward or forward.  \"Starboard oars, steady--pull!\" and the rowers indicated by this command caught the stroke, and the light bark shot ahead, with her wonted speed, in the direction of Rippleton village.  \"Zephyr, ahoy!\" shouted some one from the shore.  \"Tim Bunker--ain't it?\" asked Charles.  \"Yes.\"  \"Humph! he needn't hail us like that. I was sure your father would never permit him to join the club,\" continued Charles, who fancied that he read in Frank's expression the disapproval of his father.  \"You are in the wrong, Charley.\"  \"Am I?\"  \"You are; my father cordially approved our action. Now, Zephyrs, I am going up to Flat Rock to take him aboard; and I hope every fellow will treat him well--just as though he had never done anything out of the way. What do you say?\"  \"We will,\" they replied, with one voice.  \"And then, if he does not walk straight, it will not be our fault. Treat him as though he was the best fellow among us. Let nothing tempt us to forget it.\"  Frank headed the boat towards the rock in the grove, and in a moment the bow touched it.  Without waiting for an invitation, Tim jumped into the boat, and took the vacant seat. Frank did not much like this forwardness: it was a little too \"brazen\" to comport with his ideas of true penitence. But he did not care to humble the \"Bunker;\" so he said nothing that would wound his feelings.  \"We are glad to see you, Tim; the club has this day elected you a member, and our director has approved the vote,\" said Frank.  \"Has he?\" replied Tim, with a broad grin.  \"And, if you like, we will go up to the boat-house, where you may sign the constitution.\"  \"Yes, I'll sign it,\" answered Tim, more as though it would be conferring a favor on the club than as a duty he owed to his new friends.  Frank gave the necessary orders to get the boat under way again. Tim handled his oar with considerable skill, and before they reached the boat-house, he had learned to time his stroke with that of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15002"],["title","All Aboard; or, Life on the Lake (#3)"],["body","ompanions.  When they landed, Captain Sedley took Tim apart with him, and very kindly told him what would be expected of him in his new relation, urging him to be true to his good resolution, and assuring him that he should never want for substantial encouragement so long as he persevered in well doing. Tim hung his head down while he listened to this kind advice; his answers were short, but they were all satisfactory, so far as words could be taken as the index of his intentions.  Frank then read the constitution, and the new member listened to it with attention. The stringent provisions of the sixth article, which forbade swearing, indecent language, and other boyish vices, brought a scarcely visible smile to his lips, and excited a doubt as to the success of the experiment in the mind of the director.  \"Now, Tim, you can sign it,\" said Frank.  \"It's pretty strict--ain't it?\" added Tim, with one of his peculiar grins, as he took the pen that was handed to him. \"You know I ain't used to being quite so strained up as you fellers, and I may kinder break through afore I know it.\"  \"If you do, you shall be judged kindly and charitably,\" said Captain Sedley.  \"Well. I'll sign it.\"  But it was not quite so easy a thing for Tim to sign; at least, to perform the mechanical part of the act, for he had been to school but little, and good penmanship was not one of his accomplishments. However, he succeeded in getting over the form, though it would have puzzled the secretary to read it, if he had not known what it was.  \"Now, Zephyrs, Tim is one of us,\" said Frank.  \"He hasn't got any uniform,\" suggested Charles.  \"He shall have one,\" replied Captain Sedley, as he wrote an order on Mr. Burlap, the tailor, to supply him with a uniform.  \"All aboard!\" shouted Frank. \"We will pull up the lake, and see how the Butterfly gets along. They have been practising for a fortnight, and they ought to be able to row pretty well by this time.\"  \"With Uncle Ben to show them how,\" added Fred Harper.  Again the Zephyrs were in their seats, and the boat was backed out into the lake. The flags were unrolled, and put in their places. The graceful barge was nicely trimmed, so as to rest exactly square in the water, and everything was ready for a sharp pull. The weather was cool, and the boys required some pretty vigorous exercise to keep them warm.  The various commands were given and executed with the usual precision, only that Tim, who was not thoroughly \"broken in,\" made some blunders, though, considering his short service, his proficiency was decidedly creditable.  The Zephyr darted away like an arrow, and the slow, measured, musical stroke of the oars was pleasant and exciting to the rowers.  \"You haven't told us about the other matter yet, Frank,\" said Charles, as the boat skimmed along over the little waves of the lake.  \"Let us know about it,\" added Fred.  \"About what?\" asked Tim Bunker, whose modesty in his new position did not seem to cause him much trouble.  \"We are to have a race with the Butterfly, when Tony gets things to his mind,\" replied Frank.  \"That'll be fun! Are ye going to put up anything?\"  \"Put up anything?\"  \"Yes; what's going to be the stakes?\"  \"I don't know what you mean, Tim.\"  \"When they race horses, each man bets on his own.\"  \"We are not going to bet; that would be contrary to the constitution.\"  \"Would it? I didn't hear nothing about betting.\"  \"Article second says that one of the objects of the association shall be the acquiring of good habits in general; and I am sure betting is a very bad habit.\"  \"Well, I s'pose it is.\"  \"But several gentlemen of Rippleton have subscribed fifty dollars as a prize to the winner of the race,\" added Frank; \"just as they give medals in school, you know.\"  \"Well, of course you will win.\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"You are used to your boat, and them fellers ain't.\"  \"We can't tell yet; perhaps the Butterfly will prove to be a faster boat than the Zephyr, and some of Tony's members are a good deal larger and stouter than ours. I think the chances are about equal.\"  \"I think likely. What are you going to do with the money if you win?\"  \"I don't know; we haven't thought of that yet,\" replied Frank, not particularly pleased with the question.  \"Divide it among the fellers, I s'pose.\"  \"I think not; we had better apply it to some useful purpose,--that is, if we win it,--such as enlarging our library, buying some philosophical instruments--\"  \"What's them?\"  \"An air pump, and other apparatus of the kind.\"  Tim did not comprehend the nature of the mystical implements any better than before; but as his mind was fixed upon something else, he did not demand further explanation.  \"Fifty dollars,\" said he; \"how much will that be apiece. Thirteen into fifty; can any of you fellers cipher that up in your heads?\"  \"Three and eleven thirteenths dollars each,\" said William Bright, who pulled the next oar forward of Tim. \"Three dollars and eighty-five cents--isn't it?\"  \"Eighty-four and a fraction,\" replied Fred, with schoolboy accuracy.  \"A feller could have a good time on that, I'll bet,\" ejaculated Tim.  \"And many a poor man would like it to buy bread for his family,\" added Frank. \"But there is the Butterfly!\"  Tim Bunker dropped his oar at this announcement, and was on the point of rising to get a better view of the Zephyr's rival, when the handle of William Bright's oar gave him a smart rap in the back.  \"Mind out!\" said Tim. \"Don't you know any better than to hit a feller in that way?\"  \"Cease--rowing!\" called Frank, as he saw Tim's first involuntarily double up, and his eye flash with anger.  \"It was your fault, Tim, and you must not blame him,\" added the coxswain, mildly, but firmly.  \"My fault!\" and Tim added an expression which I cannot put upon my page.  \"Such language as that is contrary to the constitution,\" continued Frank. \"You stopped rowing without orders.\"  \"What if I did!\"  \"You should not have done so. No member can do, or cease to do, without orders; that's our discipline.\"  Tim cooled off in a moment, made a surly apology for his rudeness, and the Zephyr continued on her course.     CHAPTER IV.  THE FRATERNAL HUG.   The incident which had just occurred gave Frank considerable uneasiness. Tim was naturally quarrelsome, and his former mode of life had done nothing to improve his disposition. He had never been taught that self-restraint is necessary to preserve social harmony. If anything did not suit him, he was not disposed to argue the matter in a conciliatory manner, but to right his wrongs, whether real or imaginary, by physical force. In this manner he had obtained his reputation as a \"good fighter.\"  Frank began to fear that Tim had come into the club without a proper understanding of its duties and requirements. Though he had, with an ill grace, apologized for his conduct, he seemed to feel no compunction on account of it; but, on the contrary, he every moment grew more overbearing and insolent. He could not speak to his companions in a gentlemanly manner, as they had been accustomed to be addressed. He was course, rude, and vulgar; and the members, who had received him among them in the best spirit possible, began to feel some repugnance towards him.  But what could be expected of him in so short a time? They had no reason to believe that a boy who had always been a desperado would suddenly become a gentle and kind-hearted person. His nature wanted refining, and such a work could not be done in a moment. These reflections came to Frank's relief, when he had become well-nigh discouraged at the idea of reforming Tim--discouraged more by thinking of the vast chasm that yawned between what he was and what he ought to be. Like the pendulum in the story, he was crowding the work of months and years into a single instant. A little sober thought in the proper direction set him right.  The Butterfly was darting out of \"Weston Bay\" as they approached.  \"Cease--rowing!\" said Frank. \"Now, my lads, let us give them three rousing cheers. All up! One!\"  \"Hurrah!\"  \"Two.\"  \"Hurrah!\"  \"Three.\"  \"Hurrah!\"  And then the Zephyrs clapped their hands, long and loudly, and this was the greeting which the old club gave to the new one. The compliment was heartily returned by the Butterfly, and then the cheers were repeated again and again. Every member seemed to glow with kindly feeling towards the others. Even Tim Bunker for the time laid aside his morose look, and joined in the expression of good will with as much zeal as his companions.  \"Now man your oars, Zephyrs,\" said Frank.  \"What ye going to do now?\" asked Tim, as he grasped his oar with the others.  \"You shall know in due time,\" replied the coxswain.  Here was another thing which Tim had yet to learn--not to ask questions of the commander. It was a part of the discipline of the club to obey without stopping to argue the point. Captain Sedley himself had suggested this idea, and it had been thoroughly carried out on board the Zephyr. It was an established principle that \"the coxswain knew what he was about,\" and that he alone was responsible for the guidance and the safety of the boat.  Tim did not seem to fancy this kind of discipline. He evidently felt that he had been born to command, and not to obey. But the consciousness that he was in the minority induced him to yield whatever convictions he might have had of his own superiority to the will of the \"powers that be,\" and he followed the example of the others.  \"Ready--pull!\" continued Frank.  He and Tony had arranged a little system of \"fleet maneuvers,\" to be carried out when the two boats met.  To the surprise of all on board,--for they were not \"posted up\" in regard to these tactics,--Frank put the Zephyr about.  \"Cease--rowing!\" said he, when the boat was headed in the opposite direction.  To the further surprise of the Zephyrs, they discovered that the Butterfly had executed a similar maneuver, and that the two boats lay at the distance of nearly a quarter of a mile apart, the bow "]]]
