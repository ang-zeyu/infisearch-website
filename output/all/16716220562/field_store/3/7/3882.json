The captain had received secret instructions from the parents to accede to such a wish, and the boy was landed, and in due time returned home as a passenger. So it is said that George Washington had an early passion for the sea, and would have become a sailor but for the pain he knew it would give his mother.  James kept his longings to himself for the present, and returned home with the seven dollars he had so hardly earned.  There was more work for him to do. A Mr. Treat wanted help during the haying and harvesting season, and offered employment to the boy, who was already strong enough to do almost as much as a man; for James already had a good reputation as a faithful worker. \"Whatever his hands found to do, he did it with his might,\" and he was by no means fastidious as to the kind of work, provided it was honest and honorable.  When the harvest work was over James made known his passion for the sea.  Going to his mother, he said: \"Mother, I want above all things to go to sea.\"  \"Go to sea!\" replied his mother in dismay. \"What has put such an idea into your head?\"  \"It has been in my head for a long time,\" answered the boy quietly. \"I have thought of nothing else for the last year.\"     CHAPTER III.  IN QUEST OF FORTUNE.   James had so persuaded himself that the sea was his vocation, and was so convinced of the pleasures and advantages it would bring, that it had not occurred to him that his mother would object.  \"What made you think of the sea, James?\" his mother asked with a troubled face.  \"It was the books I read last year, at the black salter's. Oh, mother, did you ever read Marryatt's novels, and 'Sinbad the Sailor'?\"  \"I have read 'Sinbad the Sailor,' but you know that is a fairy story, my son.\"  \"It may be, but Marryatt's stories are not. It must be splendid to travel across the mighty ocean, and see foreign countries.\"  \"A sailor doesn't have the chance to see much. You have no idea of the hardships of his life.\"  \"I am used to hardships, and I am not afraid of hard work. But you seem disappointed, mother. What have you thought of for me?\"  \"I have hoped, James, that you might become a learned man, perhaps a college professor. Surely that would be better than to be a common sailor.\"  \"But I wouldn't stay a common sailor, mother. I would be a captain some time.\"  I suppose there is no doubt that, had James followed the sea, he would have risen to the command of a ship, but the idea did not seem to dazzle his mother.  \"If you go to sea I shall lose you,\" said his mother. \"A sailor can spend very little time with his family. Think carefully, my son. I believe your present fancy will be short-lived, and you will some day wonder that you ever entertained it.\"  Such, however, was not the boy's idea at the time. His mother might have reason on her side, but it takes more than reason to dissipate a boy's passion for the sea.  \"You speak of my becoming a scholar, mother,\" he said, \"but there doesn't seem much chance of it. I see nothing but work as a carpenter, or on the farm.\"  \"You don't know what God may have in store for you, my son. As you say, there seems no way open at present for you to become a scholar; but if you entertain the desire the way will be open. Success comes to him who is in earnest.\"  \"What, then, do you want me to do, mother! Do you wish me to stay at home?\"  \"No, for there seems little for you to do here. Go to Cleveland, if you like, and seek some respectable employment. If, after a time, you find your longing for the sea unconquered, it will be time to look out for a berth on board ship.\"  James, in spite of his earnest longing to go to sea, was a reasonable boy, and he did not object to his mother's plan. The next morning he tied his slender stock of clothing in a small bundle, bade a tearful good-bye to his mother, whose loving glances followed him far along his road, and with hope and enthusiasm trudged over a hard road to Cleveland, that beautiful city, whither, nearly forty years afterward, he was to be carried in funereal state, amid the tears of countless thousands. In that city where his active life began, it was to finish.  A long walk was before him, for Cleveland was seventeen miles away. He stopped to rest at intervals, and it was not until the sun had set and darkness enveloped the town that he entered it with weary feet.  He betook himself to a cheap boarding-place whither he had been directed, and soon retired to bed. His fatigue brought him a good night's sleep, and he woke refreshed and cheered to look about him and decide upon his future plans.  Cleveland does not compare in size with New York, Philadelphia, or Boston, and thirty-five years ago it was much smaller than now. But compared with James' native place, and the villages near him, it was an impressive place. There were large business blocks, and handsome churches, and paved streets, and a general city-like appearance which interested James greatly. On the whole, even if he had to give up going to sea, he thought he might enjoy himself in such a lively place as this. But of course he must find employment.  So he went into a store and inquired if they wanted a boy.  \"What can you do?\" asked the storekeeper, looking at the boy with his countrified air and rustic suit.  \"I can read, write, and cipher,\" answered James.  \"Indeed!\" said the storekeeper smiling. \"All our boys can do that. Is that all you can do?\"  James might have answered that he could chop wood, work at carpentering, plant and harvest, but he knew very well that these accomplishments would be but little service to him here. Indeed, he was rather puzzled to know what he could do that would earn him a living in a smart town life Cleveland. However, he didn't much expect to find his first application successful, so he entered another store and preferred his request.  \"You won't suit us,\" was the brusque reply. \"You come from the country, don't you?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You look like it. Well, I will give you a piece of advice.\"  \"What is that, sir?\"  \"Go back there. You are better suited to country than the city. I daresay you would make a very good hand on a farm. We need different sort of boys here.\"  This was discouraging. James didn't know why he would not do for a city store or office. He was strong enough, and he thought he knew enough, for he had not at present much idea of what was taught at seminaries of a higher grade than the district schools he had been accustomed to attend.  \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"I've done what mother asked me to do. I've tried to get a place here, and there doesn't seem to be a place for me. After all, I don't know but I'd better go to Ohio.\"  Cleveland was not of course a sea-port, but it had considerable lake trade, and had a line of piers.  James found his way to the wharves, and his eye lighted up as he saw the sloops and schooners which were engaged in inland trade. He had never seen a real ship, or those schooners and sloops would have had less attraction for him.  In particular his attention was drawn to one schooner, not over-clean or attractive, but with a sea-faring look, as if it had been storm-tossed and buffeted. Half a dozen sailors were on board, but they were grimed and dirty, and looked like habitual drinkers--probably James would not have fancied becoming like one of these, but he gave little thought to their appearance. He only thought how delightful it would be to have such a floating home.  \"Is the captain on board?\" the boy ventured to ask.  \"He's down below,\" growled the sailor whom he addressed.  \"Will he soon come up?\"  He was answered in the affirmative.  So James lingered until the man he inquired for came up.  He was a brutal-looking man, as common in appearance as any of the sailors whom he commanded, and the boy was amazed at his bearing. Surely that man was not his ideal of a ship-captain. He thought of him as a sort of prince, but there was nothing princely about the miserable, bloated wretch before him.  Still he preferred his application.  \"Do you want a new hand?\" asked James.  His answer was a volley of oaths and curses that made James turn pale, for he had never uttered an oath in his life, and had never listened to anything so disgusting as the tirade to which he was forced to listen.  [Illustration: THE CANAL BOY]  He sensibly concluded that nothing was to be gained by continuing the conversation with such a man. He left the schooner's deck with a feeling of discomfiture. He had never suspected that sailors talked or acted like the men he saw.  Still he clung to the idea that all sailors were not like this captain. Perhaps again the rebuff he received was in consequence of his rustic appearance. The captain might be prejudiced against him, just as the shop-keepers had been, though the latter certainly had not expressed themselves in such rude and profane language. He might not be fit for a sailor yet, but he could prepare himself.  He bethought himself of a cousin of his, by name Amos Letcher, who had not indeed arrived at the exalted position of captain of a schooner, but was content with the humbler position of captain of a canal-boat on the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal.  This seemed to James a lucky thought.  \"I will go to Amos Letcher,\" he said to himself. \"Perhaps he can find me a situation on a canal-boat, and that will be the next thing to being on board a ship.\"  This thought put fresh courage into the boy, and he straightway inquired for the _Evening Star_, which was the name of the boat commanded by his cousin.     CHAPTER IV.  ON THE TOW-PATH.   Captain Letcher regarded his young cousin in surprise.  \"Well, Jimmy, what brings you to Cleveland?\" he asked.  \"I came here to ship on the lake,\" the boy answered. \"I tried first to get a place in a store, as I promised mother, but I found no opening. I would rather be a sailor.\"  \"I am afraid your choice is not a good one; a good place on land is much better than going to sea.

Can you drive a pair of horses?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"Then I will engage you. The pay is not very large, but you will live on the boat.\"  \"How much do you pay?\" asked James, who was naturally interested in the answer to this question.  \"We pay from eight to ten dollars a month, according to length of service and fidelity. Of course, as a new hand, you can not expect ten dollars.\"  \"I shall be satisfied with eight, cousin.\"  \"Now, as to your duties. You will work six hours on and six hours off. That's what we call a trick--the six hours on, I mean. So you will have every other six hours to rest, or do anything you like; that is, after you have attended to the horses.\"  \"Horses!\" repeated James, puzzled; for the animals attached to the boat at that moment were mules.  \"Some of our horses are mules,\" said Captain Letcher, smiling. \"However, it makes no difference. You will have to feed and rub them down, and then you can lie down in your bunk, or do anything else you like.\"  \"That won't be very hard work,\" said James, cheerfully.  \"Oh, I forgot to say that you can ride or walk, as you choose. You can rest yourself by changing from one to the other.\"  James thought he should like to ride on horseback, as most boys do. It was not, however, so good fun as he anticipated. A canal-boat horse is by no means a fiery or spirited creature. His usual gait is from two to two and a half miles an hour, and to a boy of quick, active temperament the slowness must be rather exasperating. Yet, in the course of a day a boat went a considerable distance. It usually made fifty, and sometimes sixty miles a day. The rate depended on the number of locks it had to pass through.  Probably most of my young readers understand the nature of a lock. As all water seeks a level, there would be danger in an uneven country that some parts of the canal would be left entirely dry, and in others the water would overflow. For this reason at intervals locks are constructed, composed of brief sections of the canal barricaded at each end by gates. When a boat is going down, the near gates are thrown open and the boat enters the lock, the water rushing in till a level is secured; then the upper gates are closed, fastening the boat in the lock. Next the lower gates are opened, the water in the lock seeks the lower level of the other section of the canal, and the boat moves out of the lock, the water subsiding gradually beneath it. Next, the lower gates are closed, and the boat proceeds on its way. It will easily be understood, when the case is reversed, and the boat is going up, how after being admitted into the lock it will be lifted up to the higher level when the upper gates are thrown open.  If any of my young readers find it difficult to understand my explanation, I advise them to read Jacob Abbot's excellent book, \"Rollo on the Erie Canal,\" where the whole matter is lucidly explained.  Railroads were not at that time as common as now, and the canal was of much more importance and value as a means of conveying freight. Sometimes passengers traveled that way, when they were in not much of a hurry, but there were no express canal-boats, and a man who chose to travel in that way must have abundant leisure on his hands. There is some difference between traveling from two to two and a half miles an hour, and between thirty and forty, as most of our railroad express trains do.  James did not have to wait long after his engagement before he was put on duty. With boyish pride he mounted one of the mules and led the other. A line connected the mules with the boat, which was drawn slowly and steadily through the water. James felt the responsibility of his situation. It was like going to sea on a small scale, though the sea was but a canal. At all events, he felt that he had more important work to do than if he were employed as a boy on one of the lake schooners.  James was at this time fifteen; a strong, sturdy boy, with a mass of auburn hair, partly covered by a loose-fitting hat. He had a bright, intelligent face, and an earnest look that attracted general attention. Yet, to one who saw the boy guiding the patient mule along the tow-path, it would have seemed a most improbable prediction, that one day the same hand would guide the ship of State, a vessel of much more consequence than the humble canal-boat.  There was one comfort, at any rate. Though in his rustic garb he was not well enough dressed to act as clerk in a Cleveland store, no one complained that he was not well enough attired for a canal-boy.  It will occur to my young reader that, though the work was rather monotonous, there was not much difficulty or danger connected with it. But even the guidance of a canal-boat has its perplexities, and James was not long in his new position before he realized it.  It often happened that a canal-boat going up encountered another going down, and _vice versa_. Then care has to be exercised by the respective drivers lest their lines get entangled.  All had been going on smoothly till James saw another boat coming. It might have been his inexperience, or it might have been the carelessness of the other driver, but at any rate the lines got entangled. Meanwhile the boat, under the impetus that had been given it, kept on its way until it was even with the horses, and seemed likely to tow them along.  \"Whip up your team, Jim, or your line will ketch on the bridge!\" called out the steersman.  The bridge was built over a waste-way which occurred just ahead, and it was necessary for James to drive over it.  The caution was heeded, but too late. James whipped up his mules, but when he had reached the middle of the bridge the rope tightened, and before the young driver fairly understood what awaited him, he and his team were jerked into the canal. Of course he was thrown off the animal he was riding, and found himself struggling in the water side by side with the astonished mules. The situation was a ludicrous one, but it was also attended with some danger. Even if he did not drown, and the canal was probably deep enough for that, he stood in some danger of being kicked by the terrified mules.  The boy, however, preserved his presence of mind, and managed, with help, to get out himself and to get his team out.  Then Captain Letcher asked him, jocosely, \"What were you doing in the canal, Jim?\"  \"I was just taking my morning bath,\" answered the boy, in the same vein.  \"You'll do,\" said the captain, struck by the boy's coolness.  Six hours passed, and James' \"trick\" was over. He and his mules were both relieved from duty. Both were allowed to come on board the boat and rest for a like period, while the other driver took his place on the tow-path.  \"Well, Jim, how do you like it as far as you've got?\" asked the captain.  \"I like it,\" answered the boy.  \"Shall you be ready to take another bath to-morrow morning?\" asked his cousin, slyly.  \"I think one bath a week will be sufficient,\" was the answer.  Feeling a natural interest in his young cousin, Amos Letcher thought he would examine him a little, to see how far his education had advanced. Respecting his own ability as an examiner he had little doubt, for he had filled the proud position of teacher in Steuben County, Indiana, for three successive winters.  \"I suppose you have been to school more or less, Jim?\" he said.  \"Oh, yes,\" answered the boy.  \"What have you studied?\"  James enumerated the ordinary school branches. They were not many, for his acquirements were not extensive; but he had worked well, and was pretty well grounded as far as he had gone.     CHAPTER V.  AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.   \"I've taught school myself,\" said Captain Letcher, complacently. \"I taught for three winters in Indiana.\"  James, who, even then, had a high opinion of learning, regarded the canal-boat captain with increased respect.  \"I didn't know that,\" he answered, duly impressed.  \"Yes, I've had experience as a teacher. Now, if you don't mind, I'll ask you a few questions, and find out how much you know. We've got plenty of time, for it's a long way to Pancake Lock.\"  [Illustration: CONFERENCE WITH DR. ROBINSON]  \"Don't ask me too hard questions,\" said the boy. \"I'll answer the best I know.\"  Upon this Captain Letcher, taking a little time to think, began to question his young cousin in the different branches he had enumerated. The questions were not very hard, for the good captain, though he had taught school in Indiana, was not a profound scholar.  James answered every question promptly and accurately, to the increasing surprise of his employer.  The latter paused.  \"Haven't you any more questions?\" asked James.  \"No, I don't think of any.\"  \"Then may I ask you some?\"  \"Yes, if you want to,\" answered the captain, rather surprised.  \"Very well,\" said James. \"A man went to a shoemaker and bought a pair of boots, for which he was to pay five dollars. He offered a fifty-dollar bill, which the shoemaker sent out and had changed. He paid his customer forty-five dollars in change, and the latter walked off with the boots. An hour later he ascertained that the bill was a counterfeit, and he was obliged to pay back fifty dollars in good money to the man who had changed the bill for him. Now, how much did he lose?\"  \"That's easy enough. He lost fifty dollars and the boots.\"  \"I don't think that's quite right,\" said James, smiling.  \"Of course it is. Didn't he have to pay back fifty dollars in good money, and didn't the man walk off with the boots?\"  \"That's true; but he neither lost nor made by changing the bill."]]]
