He was tall enough to be conspicuous and well bred enough to be indifferent to the fact, good looking, in a bronzed, blond clean-shaven way, and branded in the popular imagination as a young and active millionaire.  At a neighbouring table a man lent forward and whispered to the other men and women with him:  “Do you know who that is?—that is young Holland.”  “What, that boy! He doesn’t look as if he were out of school.”  “No,” said one of the women, elaborating the comment, “he does not look old enough to order a dinner, let alone managing mines.”  “Oh, I guess he can order a dinner all right,” said the first man. “He is older than he looks. He must be twenty-six.”  “What do you suppose he does with all that money?”  The first thing he did with it, at the moment, was to purchase an evening paper, for just then he snapped his fingers at a boy, who promptly ran to get him one.  “Well, one thing he does,” answered the man who had first given information, “he has an apartment in this building, up stairs, and I bet that costs him a pretty penny.”  In the meantime Holland had opened his paper, scanned the head lines, and was about to turn to the stock quotations when a paragraph of interest caught his eye. So marked was the gesture with which he raised it to his eyes that his admirers at the next table noticed it, and speculated on the subject of the paragraph.  It was headed: “Millionaires’ Summer Homes Looted,” and said further:  “Hillsborough, December 21st. The fourth in a series of daring robberies which have been taking place in this neighbourhood during the past month occurred last night when the residence of C. B. Vaughan of New York was entered and valuable wines and bric-a-brac removed. The robbery was not discovered until this morning when a shutter was observed unfastened on the second story. On entering the watchman found the house had been carefully gone over, and although only a few objects seem to be missing, these are of the greatest value. The thief apparently had plenty of time, and probably occupied the whole night in his search. This is the more remarkable because the watchman asserts that he spent at least an hour on the piazza during the night. How the thief effected an entrance by the second story is not clear. During the past five weeks the houses of L. G. Innes, T. Wilson and Abraham Marheim have been entered in a manner almost precisely similar. There was a report yesterday that some of the Marheim silver had been discovered with a dealer in Boston, but that he could not identify the person from whom he bought them further than that she was a young lady to whom they might very well have belonged. The fact that it was a young lady who disposed of them to him suggests that the goods must have changed hands several times. The Marheim family is abroad, and the servants....”  Here a waiter touched his elbow.  “Mr. and Mrs. Vaughan have come, sir,” he said.  “Send up to my apartment and tell Mrs. May we are sitting down to dinner,” returned Holland promptly, and advanced to meet the prosperous looking couple approaching.  “I’m afraid we are late,” said the lady, “but can you blame us? Have you heard? We have been telegraphing to Hillsborough all the afternoon to find out what has gone.”  “You are not late. My sister has not come down yet. I was just reading about your robbery. Have you lost anything of value?”  “Oh, I suppose so,” said Mrs. Vaughan cheerfully, sitting down and beginning to draw off her gloves. “We had a Van Dyke etching, and some enamels that have gone certainly, and Charlie feels awfully about his wine.”  “Yes,” said Mr. Vaughan gloomily. “I tell you he is going to have a happy time with that champagne. It is the best I ever tasted.”  “Upon my word,” said Geoffrey, “they are a nice lot of countrymen up there. Four robberies and not so much as a clue.”  “_You_ need not be afraid,” said Mrs. Vaughan rather spitefully. “In spite of all your treasures, I don’t believe any thief would take the trouble to climb to the top of your mountain.”  Holland’s selection of a distant hilltop for his large place pleased no true Hillsboroughite. As an eligible bachelor he was inaccessible, and as a property-holder he was too far away to increase the value of Hillsborough real-estate by his wonderful lawns and gardens.  Mrs. Vaughan’s irritation did not appear to disturb Geoffrey, for he laughed very amiably, and replied that he could only hope that the thief was as poor a pedestrian as she seemed to imagine as he should not like to lose any of his things; and he added that in his opinion Vaughan ought to be starting for Hillsborough at once.  “Pooh,” said that gentleman, “I can’t go with the market in this condition,—would lose more than the whole house is worth.”  “You would go duck-shooting in a minute,” said Holland, “and this would be a good deal better sport.”  Mr. Vaughan ignored this remark. “The thing to do,” he said, “is to offer a reward, a big enough reward to attract some first-class detective.”  “All right,” said Geoffrey readily, “I’ll join you. Those other fellows ought to be willing to put up a thousand apiece,—that will be five thousand. Is that enough? We can have it in the papers to-morrow. What shall I say? Five thousand dollars reward will be paid for information leading to the conviction—and so on. I’ll go and telephone now,” and with a promptness which surprised Mr. Vaughan, he was gone.  When he came back his sister was in her place and they were all discussing the burglary with interest. Mrs. May, who was somewhat older than her brother, had some of the more agreeable qualities of a gossip, that is to say she had imagination and a good memory for detail.  “For my part,” she was saying, “I have the greatest respect and admiration for him. Do you know he could not find anything worth taking at the Wilsons’,—after all his trouble. I have often sat in that drawing-room myself, and wondered if they should offer me anything in it as a present, whether I could find something that would not actually disgrace me. I never could. He evidently felt the same way. The Wilsons make a great to-do about the house having been entered, and tell you how he must have been frightened away,—frightened away by the hideousness of their things! Those woolly paintings on wood, and the black satin parasol that turns out to be an umbrella stand.”  “My dear Florence,” said her brother mildly, “how can a black satin parasol be an umbrella-stand?”  “Exactly, Geof, how can it? That is what you say all through the Wilsons’ house. How can it be! However it is not really black satin, only painted to resemble it. The waste paper baskets look like trunks of trees, and the match boxes like old shoes. Nothing in the house is really what it looks like, except the beds; they look uncomfortable, and some one who had stayed there told me that they were.”  “Dear Florence,” said Mrs. Vaughan, “is it not like her kindness of heart—it runs in the family—to try and make my burglary into a compliment, but really though it is flattering to be robbed by a connoisseur I could forego the honour. You see you have taken away my last hope that my very best escaped his attention.”  “No, indeed, the best is all he cared for. Honestly, Jane, haven’t you an admiration for a man of so much taste and ability? Just think, he has entered four houses and there is not the slightest trace of him.”  “There must be _traces_ of him,” said Geoffrey. “The Inness house was entered after that snow storm in the early part of the month. There must have been footprints.”  “Of course,” said Mr. Vaughan, “that is what makes me think that the watchmen are in it. It’s probably a combination of two or three of them.”  “Well, that lets Geoffrey out,” said the irrepressible Florence. “No one would take his watchman into any combination,—he is a thousand and two and feeble for his age. However, there is no use in discussing the possibility, for it is not a combination of watchmen, begging your pardon, Mr. Vaughan. It is lonely genius, a slim, dark figure in a slouch hat. That is the way I imagine him. Do you really suppose that a watchman would take six pair of Mrs. Inness’ best linen sheets, embroidered in her initials, the monogram so thick that it scratches your nose; and a beautiful light blue silk coverlet,—all just out from Paris. I saw them when she first had them.”  “What,” said Geoffrey, addressing the other male intellect present, “do you make of the young woman who disposed of some of the Marheim silver in Boston?”   [Illustration: “It was a young lady who disposed of the silver”]   But it was Mrs. May who answered: “She is of course the lady of his love—a lady doubtless of high social position in Boston. There was a book about something like that once. He is just waiting to make one more grand coup, rob the bank or something and then the world will be startled by the news of their elopement. They will go and live somewhere luxuriously in the south Pacific, and travellers will bring "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],["title","The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#1)"],["body","strange stories of their happiness and charm. Perhaps, though, he would turn pirate. That would suit his style.”  “I hope,” said Holland, “that he won’t take a fancy to rob the Hillsborough Bank, for I consider it public spirited to keep quite a little money there. You begin to make me nervous.”  “No bank robbery would make _me_ nervous,” replied his sister, “that is the comfort of being insignificant. I have not enough money in any bank to know the difference, and as for my humble dwelling in Hillsborough, who would take the trouble to rifle it when Geoffrey’s palace is within an easy walk. Besides, I haven’t anything worth the attention of a respectable burglar like this one.”  “Thank you,” said Geoffrey, “I’m sorry I spent so much time choosing your Christmas present a year ago.”  “Oh, of course, Geof dear, that wonderful old silver is valuable, but it is put away where I defy any burglar to find it. There is only my sable coat, and I am going to send for that as soon as I have time to have it cut over.”  “In my opinion,” said Mr. Vaughan, “the man is no longer in the neighbourhood. He would scarcely dare try a fifth attempt while the whole country was so aroused. You see Hillsborough has always been an attractive place to thieves. It is such an easy place to get away from,—three railroads within reach. A man would be pretty sure to be able to catch a passing freight train on one of them at almost any time, to say nothing of the increased difficulty of tracing him.”  “I don’t suppose he will ever be caught,” said Florence. “When he has got all he wants he will simply melt away and be forgotten. If he were caught—”  Here she was interrupted by the waiter who laid a telegram at her plate. It had come to her brother’s apartment, and been sent down.  “Who is telegraphing me,” she said, as she tore it open. “I hope Jack has not been breaking himself.”  Opening it, she read:  “Your house was entered about five o’clock this afternoon. Tea-set and sable coat missing.”     II   The next evening at seven o’clock, Holland stepped out of the train on the Hillsborough station. He wore a long fur-coat, for the morning had been bitterly cold in New York, and though the snow was now falling in small close flakes, the temperature had not risen appreciably, and a wild wind was blowing.  He looked about for the figure of McFarlane, for he had telegraphed the old man to meet him at the train with a trap, but there was no one to be seen. The station, which in summer on the arrival of the express was a busy scene with well dressed women and well-kept horses, was now utterly deserted except for one native who had charge of the mails.  “Hullo, Harris,” Geoffrey sung out. “Is McFarlane here for me?”  “Ain’t seen him. Guess it’s too stormy for the old man,” Harris replied dropping the mail bag into his wagon.  “Then you’ve got to drive me out.”  “What, all the way to your place? No, sir, I guess it is too stormy for me, too.”  But Geoffrey at last, by the promise of three times what the trip was worth, induced Harris to change his mind. He stepped into the mail cart, and having stopped at the post-office to leave the bag, and at the stable to change the cart for a sleigh, they finally set out on their five-mile drive.  “Guess you come up to see about Mr. May’s house being robbed?” Harris hazarded before they had gone far.  “You’re a nice lot, aren’t you?” returned Geoffrey. “Five robberies and not a motion to catch the thief!”  “Oh, I dunno, I dunno, there is a big reward out to-day,” said Harris, divided between pride in the notoriety and shame at the lawlessness of his native town.  “Yes, but not by any of you.”  “Well, the boys did talk some of a vigilance committee, if any more houses was robbed.”  “They are going to wait for him to make up his half dozen.”  “Well, to tell the truth,” said Harris, “it seems like he only went for you city folks, and I guess the boys thought you could better afford to lose a few things than they could to lose their sleep. That’s about the size of it.”  Geoffrey could not but laugh. “That’s a fine spirited way to look at it, I must say.”  “Well,” returned Harris, who appeared to have need of the monosyllable in order to collect and arrange his ideas. “’Tain’t lack of sand exactly, either, for most of the fellows about here thinks it is a woman.”  “A woman?” cried Geoffrey, remembering the lady in Boston.  “Yes, _sir_,” said Harris, “a young woman. Look at the things took. What burglar would want sheets and a lady’s coat? Besides just before the first one happened, Will Brown, he was driving along up your way and a young woman, pretty as a picter, Will said, slips out of the wood and asks for a lift. Well, Will takes her some two miles, and when they got to that piece of woods at the back of your place she says of a sudden that she guesses she wants exercise, and will walk the rest of the way, and out she gets, and no one has seen her since. Seems kinder strange, no house but yours within six miles, and you away.”  “It would have seemed quite as strange if I had been at home,” returned Geoffrey, amused at his imputation.  “Well,” Harris went on imperturbably, “you can’t tell the rights of them stories. Will Brown, he’s a liar, just like all the Browns; still this time he seemed to think he was telling the truth. Looks like we were going to have a blizzard, don’t it?”  When they reached the McFarlane cottage, Mrs. McFarlane appeared bobbing on the threshold. She was an old Scotch woman and covered all occasions with courtesy. It appeared that Holland’s telegram had been duly telephoned from the office, but that her husband was down with rheumatism, the second gardener dismissed, and the “boy” allowed to go home to spend Christmas, so that there had been no one to send. Geoffrey suggested that she might have telephoned to the local livery-stable, and she was at once so overcome at her own stupidity that she could do nothing but bob and murmur, until Geoffrey sent her away to get him something to eat.  It was about ten o’clock, when he determined to take a turn about his house. The next day he intended removing all valuables to the vaults of the Hillsborough bank.  It was a long walk from the cottage, and Geoffrey, as he trudged up hill against the wind, was surprised to find how much snow had already fallen. He had expected to return to New York the next day, but now a fair prospect of being stalled on the way presented itself. It took him so much longer to reach the house than he had supposed, that he abandoned all idea of entering it. It stood before him grimly like a mountain of grey stone, its face plastered with snow. He walked round it, feeling each door and window to be sure of the fastenings. Once past the corner, the house sheltered him from the wind. He was conscious of that exhilaration snow storms so often bring, while at the same time the atmosphere of desolation that surrounds all shut up houses, even one’s own, took hold of him. Unconsciously he stopped and felt in his pocket for his revolver, and at the same moment, faintly, in the interior of the house, he heard a clock strike.  The sound was not perhaps alarming in itself, yet it sounded ominously in Geoffrey’s ears. He recognised, or thought he recognised, the bell. It was that of an old French clock he had bought, and had never had put in order. He had never been able to make it go, but once touching it inadvertently he had aroused in it a breath of life so that it had struck one,—this same sweet piercing note. Who, he wondered, was touching it now?  Geoffrey was one of those who act best and naturally without delay. Now he hesitated not at all. He had the keys of the house in his pocket, and he moved quickly toward a side door which he remembered swung silently on its hinges. It was not so much that he believed that there was any one in the house—perhaps to the most apprehensive a burglar comes as a surprise—but he felt he had too good grounds for suspicion to fail to investigate.  He unlocked the door without a sound. As he stepped within, doubt was put an end to by the patch of white light that, streaming out of the library door, fell across the passageway before him. He stooped down and took off his boots, and then cautiously approached the open door and looked in, knowing that darkness and preparation were in his favour.  His caution was unnecessary, for his entrance had not been heard. The Hillsborough theory of the femininity of the burglar instantly fell to the ground. A man of medium size was standing before one of the bookcases with his elbow resting near the clock; he was holding a volume in his hands with the careful ease of a book fancier. The man’s back was turned so that a sandy head and a strongly built figure were all Geoffrey could make out. Had it not been for a glimpse of a mask on his face, he might have been a student at work.  So intent did he appear that Geoffrey could not resist the temptation to make his entrance dramatic. Creeping almost to the other’s elbow, revolver in hand, he said gently:  “Fond of reading?”  The man, naturally startled, made a surprisingly quick movement toward his own revolver, and had it knocked out of his hand with a benumbing blow. Geoffrey secured the weapon, and seeing the man’s retreat, may be excused for supposing the struggle over.  He underestimated his adversary’s resources, for the burglar, retreating with a look of surrender, came within reach of the electric light, turned it off, and fled in the total darkness that followed. Geoffrey sprang to the switch, but the few seconds that his fingers were fumbling for it told against him. When he turned it on the room was empty. The door by which the thief had gone opened on the main hall and not on the passageway, so that Geoffrey still had time to secure the outer door. Next he lit the chandelier in the hall, but its illumination told nothing. It was Geoffrey’s own sharp ears that told him of light footsteps beyond the"]]]
