Edgar soon wanted a stick which Thomas held in his hand. He lost his balance in trying to get the stick, and fell into the water.   [Illustration: Overturned boat, people clinging to boat and debris. Another boat approaching.]   5. Mr. and Mrs. Rose both started up, and stretched out their arms to save him; but in so doing, they upset the boat.  6. Every one fell into the water, and all were in the greatest danger of being drowned.  7. Another boat was near, with but one man in it. He hastened to them as quickly as possible, and saved them from drowning.  8. Children should always be careful and quiet when they are in a boat on the water, and should obey what older people tell them.    LESSON XXXI.  MARY'S LETTER.  [Illustration: Script Exercise:       Forest Hill, June 25, 1878 My  Dear Fanny:              This morning while out rowing, we all came near being drowned. Brother Ed, in trying to take a stick from Tom Reed, tripped and fell out of the boat. Papa and Mamma caught at him to save him, and before we knew it we were all in the water. The boat upset and how we were all saved I can hardly tell. A man in another boat which was near, picked us up. Had it not been for this, you would to-day have no cousin.

Playing card scattered on ground.]   THE TIGER.  1. The tiger is a giant cat. His body is nearly covered with black stripes.  2. Unlike the lion, he runs so fast that the swiftest horse can not overtake him. He goes over the ground by making bounds or springs, one after another.  3. By night, as well as by day, the tiger watches for his prey. With a frightful roar, he will seize a man, and carry him off.  4. Have you ever thought what use whiskers are to cats? Lions have great whiskers, and so have tigers and all other animals of the cat kind.  5. Whenever you find an animal with whiskers like the cat's, you may be sure that animal steals softly among branches and thick bushes.  6. By the slightest touch on the tiger's whiskers, he knows when there is anything in his road.  7. A few years ago, some English officers went out to hunt. When coming home from their day's sport, they found a little tiger kitten.  8. They took it with them and tied it, with a collar and chain, to the pole of their tent. It played about, to the delight of all who saw it.  9. One evening, just as it was growing dark, they heard a sound that frightened them greatly. It was the roar of a tiger.  10. The kitten pulled at the chain, and tried to break away. With a sharp cry, it answered the voice outside.  11. All at once, a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent. She caught her kitten by the neck, and broke the chain which bound it.  12. Then turning to the door of the tent, she dashed away as suddenly as she had come.

One winter night, Mrs. Lord and her two little girls sat by a bright fire in their pleasant home. The girls were sewing, and their mother was busy at her knitting.  [Illustration: Mother and two girls sewing under a lamp.]  2. At last, Katie finished her work, and, looking up, said, \"Mother, I think the fire is brighter than usual. How I love to hear it crackle!\"  3. \"And I was about to say,\" cried Mary, \"that this is a better light than we had last night.\"  4. \"My dears,\" said their mother, \"it must be that you feel happier than usual to-night. Perhaps that is the reason why you think the fire better, and the light brighter.\"  5. \"But, mother,\" said Mary, \"I do not see why we are happier now than we were then; for last night cousin Jane was here, and we played 'Puss in the corner' and 'Blind man' until we all were tired.\"  6. \"I know! I know why!\" said Katie. \"It is because we have all been doing something useful to-night. We feel happy because we have been busy.\"  7. \"You are right, my dear,\" said their mother. \"I am glad you have both learned that there may be something more pleasant than play, and, at the same time, more instructive.\"    LESSON XXXIV.  dew'drops    hop'ping     la'zi est    bends    sung  pa'tience    in stead'    dar'ling     ought    rest  slum'ber     my self '    re ply'      miss     lose   BIRDIE'S MORNING SONG.  1.

Two fast friends were Willie Brown and his little dog Bounce. Willie could never think of taking a walk without Bounce. Cake and play were equally shared between them.  2. Willie taught his dog many cunning tricks, and often said that Bounce could do almost anything in the world but talk.  3. There came a time, however, when Bounce really told Willie's father something, though he could not talk. Let me tell you how he did this.  [Illustration: Boy and dog walking through forest.]  4. It was on a bright summer afternoon. Willie had strolled with Bounce down to the river, which was not more than two blocks from his father's store.  5. Willie began to throw stones into the water, and to watch the ripples as they made one circle after another.  6. Bounce lay on the grass, watching the flies that buzzed around his nose, and catching any that came too near.  7. There were some logs floating in the river near the shore. Willie jumped upon one of them, to see if he could throw a stone across the river.  8. He drew back, and sent the stone with all his might. just as it left his hand, the log turned, and he fell into the water.  9. He was very much frightened, for he did not know how to swim, and there was no one to hear, though he called as loud as he could for help.

Poor little Bounce gave a great yelp of distress. If he had been a big water dog, he could have jumped in and brought his master out.  [Illustration: Boy in water clinging to log. Dog yelping.]  2. He ran up and down the bank two or three times, barking, looking first at Willie and then around. Then he started, as fast as he could run, up the street to the store.  3. When he got there the door was shut, but he scratched against it and barked loudly, until some one came and opened it.  4. He caught hold of Mr. Brown's clothes, then ran to the door, then back again, catching at him, barking, and jumping.  5. A friend who was in the store said to Mr. Brown, \"Something must be wrong; I would put on my hat, and go with the dog.\" Bounce, seeing Mr. Brown take his hat, started for the river.  6. Then Mr. Brown thought of Willie. As he came to the river, he saw Willie's hat floating on the water, and his small arm thrown up.  7. He sprang in and caught him just as he was going down for the last time, and quickly carried him to the bank. \"Willie soon got over his fright, and no one seemed to be more delighted than Bounce.

To itself it ever talks,      From its place it never walks;    \"Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"      Tell me what it says.  2. \"I'm a very patient clock,      Never moved by hope or fear,      Though I've stood for many a year;    Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"      That is what it says.  3. \"I'm a very truthful clock:      People say about the place,      Truth is written on my face;    Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"      That is what it says.  4. \"I'm a most obliging clock;      If you wish to hear me strike,      You may do it when you like;    Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"      That is what it says.  5. \"I'm a very friendly clock;      For this truth to all I tell,      Life is short, improve it well;    Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"      That is what it says.  6.

First, we must take the peel off in two little cups, one just as large as the other. While I do this, see if you can find me two nice sticks about ten inches long.\"  5. Lucy ran out to the woodhouse to find the sticks.--\" Will these do?\"  6. \"No, they are too hard. Find some pine sticks if you can.\"  7.  \"Here are some.\"  8. \"These will do nicely. Now I must make a scale beam and a post. Can you find me a little block for a post, Lucy'!\"  9. \"Will a ribbon block do, Herbert?\"  10.  \"Yes, if it is not too thick.\"  11.  \"Here is one an inch thick.\"  12. \"That will be just right. Now get the little gimlet.\"  [Footnote: gimlet: Hand tool with a spiraled shank, a screw tip, and a cross handle; used for boring holes.]  13. Herbert worked away until he had made the beam and the post. Then he made a hole in the middle of the block, and put the post in. Next, he put the beam into a little groove at the top of the post, so that it would balance nicely.  14. \"Now, Lucy, we must have a needle and some thread. We must put four threads to each cup; then we will tie the threads to the ends of the beam.   15. \"There, Lucy, what do you think of that?\"  16. \"Why, Herbert, that is just as nice as the real scales in father's store; and you may have all my orange for making them.\"  [Illustration: Orange halves and other parts of the scale.]    LESSON XXXIX.  smelt    hide    crept    laid    floor    inn    bear    fur  young'est    danced    joy'ful ly    marched  sol'diers    bad'ly    run'ning     eld'est   [Illustration: Three children and a bear; surprised woman in background.]  THE BEAR AND THE CHILDREN.  1. In the parlor of an inn in a small town, sat a man who had been going about with a bear. He was waiting for his supper, and the bear was tied up in the yard.  2. Up in the attic, three little children were playing together. The eldest might have been six years old; the youngest, not more than two.  3. Stump! stump! stump! Some one was coming up the stairs.  4. The door flew open suddenly, and there stood the great, shaggy bear. He had got tired of waiting, and had found his way to the stairs.  5. The children were badly frightened. Each one crept into a corner, but the bear found them all out, and smelt their clothes, but did not hurt them.  6. \"This must be a great dog,\" they said, and they began to pat him.  7. Then the bear lay down on the floor, and the youngest boy climbed on his back, hid his head in the shaggy fur, and played at \"hide and seek.\"  8. The eldest boy took his drum and began to strike it, when the bear rose on his hind legs and danced. At that the children gave a merry shout.  9. The two younger boys took their wooden guns, and gave the bear one. Away they all marched around the room, keeping step.  10. Now the frightened mother of the children came to the door. But the youngest boy shouted, joyfully. \"See, we are playing soldiers!\"  11. Then the bear's master came running up, and took the bear away.

The fishhawk, or osprey, is not so large as the eagle; but he has, like the eagle, a hooked bill and sharp claws.  2. His color is a dark brown, with black and white spots, and his length is from twenty to twenty-two inches. His breast is mostly white. His tail and wings are long.  3. The fishhawk is often found sitting upon a tree over a pond, or lake, or river. He is also found by the seaside.  4. He watches the fish as they swim in the water beneath him; then he darts down suddenly and catches one of them.  5. When he catches a fish in his sharp, rough claws, he carries it off to eat, and, as he flies away with it for his dinner, an eagle sometimes meets him.  6. The eagle flies at him fiercely with his sharp bill and claws, and compels the hawk to drop the fish.  7. Then the eagle catches the fish as it falls, before it reaches the ground, and carries it off.  8. The poor fish hawk, with a loud cry, timidly flies away. He must go again to the water and catch another fish for his dinner.  9. Thus you see, that the eagle is a robber. He robs fishhawks, whose only mode of getting a living is by catching fish.

Once or twice a little leaf was heard to cry and sigh, as leaves often do, when a gentle wind is blowing. And the twig said, \"What is the matter, little leaf?\"  2. \"The wind,\" said the leaf, \"just told me that one day it would pull me off, and throw me on the ground to die.\"  3. The twig told it to the branch, and the branch told it to the tree. When the tree heard it, it rustled all over, and sent word back to the trembling leaf.  4. \"Do not be afraid,\" it said; \"hold on tight, and you shall not go off till you are ready.\"  5. So the leaf stopped sighing, and went on singing and rustling. It grew all the summer long till October. And when the bright days of autumn came, the leaf saw all the leaves around growing very beautiful.  6. Some were yellow, some were brown, and many were striped with different colors. Then the leaf asked the tree what this meant.  7. The tree said, \"All these leaves are getting ready to fly away, and they have put on these colors because of their joy.\"  8. Then the little leaf began to want to go, and grew very beautiful in thinking of it. When it was gay in colors, it saw that the branches of the tree had no bright colors on them.  9. So the leaf said, \"O branch! why are you lead- colored while we are all beautiful and golden?\"  10. \"We must keep on our working clothes,\" said the tree, \"for our work is not yet done; but your clothes are for holidays, because your task is now over.\"  11. Just then a little puff of wind came, and the leaf let go without thinking, and the wind took it up and turned it over and over.  12. Then it fell gently down under the edge of the fence, among hundreds of leaves, and has never waked to tell us what it dreamed about.

Soon as the leaves heard the wind's loud call, Down they came fluttering, one and all; Over the brown fields they danced and flew, Singing the soft little songs they knew.                     3. \"Cricket, good-by, we've been friends so long; Little brook, sing us your farewell song,-- Say you are sorry to see us go; Ah! you will miss us, right well we know.                     4. \"Dear little lambs, in your fleecy fold, Mother will keep you from harm and cold; Fondly we've watched you in vale and glade; Say, will you dream of our loving shade?\"                     5. Dancing and whirling, the little leaves went; Winter had called them, and they were content. Soon fast asleep in their earthy beds, The snow laid a coverlet over their heads.                                      George Cooper.

This is the way she did it.  2. Jessie had gone to the woods with Jamie and Joe to get green branches to trim up the house for Christmas. She wore her little cap, her white furs, and her red leggings.  [Illustration: Three girls carrying a small Christmas tree.]  3. She was a merry little girl, indeed; but she felt sad this morning because her mother had said, \"The children will all have Christmas presents, but I don't expect any for myself. We are too poor this year.\"  4. When Jessie told her brothers this, they all talked about it a great deal. \"Such a good, kind mamma, and no Christmas present! It's too bad.\"  5. \"I don't like it,\" said little Jessie, with a tear in her eye.  6.  \"Oh, she has you,\" said Joe.  7. \"But I am not something new,\" said Jessie.  8. \"Well, you will be new, Jessie,\" said Joe, \"when you get back. She has not seen you for an hour.\"  9. Jessie jumped and laughed. \"Then put me in the basket, and carry me to mamma, and say, 'I am her Christmas present.' \"  10. So they set her in the basket, and put green branches all around her. It was a jolly ride. They set her down on the doorstep, and went in and said, \"There's a Christmas present out there for you, mamma.\"  11. Mamma went and looked, and there, in a basket of green branches, sat her own little laughing girl.  12. \"Just the very thing I wanted most,\" said mamma.  13. \"Then, dear mamma,\" said Jessie, bounding out of"]]]
