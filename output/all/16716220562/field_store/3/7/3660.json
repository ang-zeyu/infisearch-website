He is not busy; I am. Good-bye, I'll see you again.\"  Miss Hanenwinkel had been in England, and had taken a great fancy to this form of expression much in vogue there, and she constantly used it as a form of farewell, whether it was apropos or not. Thus she would say to the persistent scissors-grinder, who came to the door,  \"Have you come back so soon? Do go where you are wanted if there is any such place. Good-bye. I'll see you again,\" and shut the door with a slam.  Or to the traveling agent who brought his wares to show, if asked to dismiss him, she would say,  \"We want nothing; you know very well. Don't come here again. Good-bye. I'll see you again,\" and shut the door in his face. This was a peculiarity of Miss Hanenwinkel.  Julius was quietly seated in a corner of the sitting-room, while Hunne stood before him watching with grave attention his nut-cracker's desperate grimaces as he gave him nut after nut to crack in his powerful jaws. Hunne carefully divided each kernel, giving one half to Jule, while he popped the other into his own little mouth.  Rolf approached them, repeating his question, \"Will you guess, Jule? You are not busy.\"      \"My first in France, applaudingly         The people to the actors cry:      With steady aim full in the eye,         To hit my second you must try;      My whole's a prince of prowess high,         Who fought the fight for Germany.\"  \"That is Bismarck, of course,\" said the quick-witted lad.  \"O, O, how quickly you guessed it,\" said Rolf, quite taken aback.  \"Now it is my turn; pay attention. You must try hard for this now. I have just made it up.\" And Jule declaimed with emphasis:      \"My first transforms the night,         And puts its peace to flight.      My second should you now become,         You scarce will move, for fife or drum.      My whole hath power to soothe you all,         Be your delight in church, or camp, or ball.\"  \"That is hard,\" said Rolf, who was rather a slow thinker. \"Wait a moment, Jule, I shall get it soon.\" So Rolf sat down on an ottoman to think it over at his ease.  The big Jule and the little Hunne in the mean time pursued their occupation without interruption. As an extra proof of his skill, Julius practised with the shells at hitting different objects in the room, to his little brother's delight and admiration.  \"I have it,\" cried Rolf at last, much delighted. \"It is Cat-nip!\"  \"O, O, what a guess! what are you thinking of? It is something very different, entirely different. It is music. Mew--sick--music, don't you see?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Rolf rather abashed. \"Now wait Jule, here's another. What is this?\"      \"My first sings by the water side,      My next is Heidelberg's great pride,      My whole was a blind poet, who      In England lived and suffered too.\"  \"Shakspere,\" said Julius, whose pride it was to answer instantly.  \"Wrong,\" cried Rolf, delighted. \"How could a _shake_ sing by the water side, Jule?\"  \"Oh, I supposed you meant a shake in somebody's voice, as he was riding or driving along,\" said Jule, to justify himself. \"Now what are you laughing at?\"  \"Because you have made such a wrong guess. It is some one 'very different, entirely different,' Jule. It is Milton, the blind poet Milton. Now try another because you failed in this. My first\"--  \"No, no, I must beg for a rest. It is too much brain work for vacation. I am going now to see how Castor is after my ride this morning.\" And Julius dashed off to the stable.  \"Oh, what a shame!\" cried Rolf, \"what a pity! Now there is no one to guess, and I made four splendid charades on my way home. It is too bad that you are not old enough to guess, Hunne.\"  \"But I can guess; I am old enough,\" said the little fellow rather vexed.  \"Well, then try this one, try hard. Stop playing with the nuts and I will crack some more for you bye and bye. Now listen:      \"My first conceals from light of day      The wanderer on his final way;      My second sizzling in the pan,      Makes hungrier still the hungry man;      My whole, bedecked in trappings gay,      Goes ambling on the livelong day.\"  \"A nutcracker,\" said Hunne without hesitation. Julius was his beau-ideal of all that was best, and he thought that if he imitated Jule, and answered quickly the first thing that came into his head, that was guessing.  But Rolf was angry.  \"How can you be so stupid, Hunne? Just think about it a little, can a nut cover some one on his last way?\"  \"Why, it can cover--well--the shell covers it.\"  \"Nonsense! and a nutcracker can not go ambling all day, can it, you stupid child.\"  \"Now see, mine can,\" said the little boy, who did not like to be called stupid, and he tied his handkerchief round the neck of the long suffering nutcracker and dragged it after him up and down the room, lifting it up now and then at regular intervals.  \"Oh well, yes, you think you're right; and I can't explain it because you don't understand anything about it. Just try to think a little; can you hear a cracker sizzling as its cooks, and will it make you hungry to hear it?\"  \"If I throw a cracker into the fire, won't it burn?\" said the child, planting himself before Rolf and holding his nutcracker saucily before his eyes.  \"Oh, there is no use talking to you,\" said Rolf, and was just about leaving the room, but this was not so easily done, for now Hunne was bitten with the mania for riddle-making himself.  \"Stop, Rolf,\" he cried and grasped his brother by the jacket to hold him. \"My first is not good to drink but to eat--\"  \"Oh dear, well, that must be 'nutcracker' again,\" and Rolf ran off, wrenching himself from his tormentor's hands. But the boy followed him, crying, \"Wrong, wrong! you are wrong. Try again, try again!\"  Moreover, Wili and Lili came scampering in from the other side, crying out,  \"Rolf, Rolf, a riddle! guess! try!\" and Lili held up a strip of paper and rattled it before Rolfs eyes, repeating, \"Guess, guess, Rolf.\"  So the riddle-maker was now caught in his own meshes.  \"Well, at least leave me room to guess in,\" cried he, striking about him with his arms to make room.  \"You can't guess anything,\" cried little Hunne contemptuously, \"I am going to Jule--he knows.\"  Rolf took the little slip of yellowish paper that Lili was waving back and forth, and looked at it in surprise. In a childish hand-writing that he had never seen before, were written the following words,      \"Come lay your hand      Joined thus we      Each the other      That our union      But behold the      That our future      We will cut our      Half for you and      But we still will      That our halves      And with us      Our friendship.\"  \"It is probably a rebus,\" said Rolf thoughtfully. \"I shall guess it after a little while. Just let me stay alone long enough to think it out.\"  There was not much time left for this however, for the dinner-bell sounded and all the family assembled in the large hall for the mid-day meal.  \"What nice thing has my little Hunne done to-day?\" asked the father, when they were at last all busy over their plates.  \"I made a splendid riddle, Papa, but Rolf never tries to guess my riddles, and I couldn't find Jule, and the rest would not listen to me at all.\"  \"Yes, Papa,\" interrupted Rolf! \"and I too have made three or four splendid ones, but no one has time to guess them, and those who have time enough are so stupid that there is no use in trying to get any answer from them. When Jule has guessed one he thinks he has done enough, and I can make at least six in a day.\"  \"Yes, yes, Papa\"--it was now Wili's and Lili's turn--\"and we have found such a hard riddle, so hard that even Rolf couldn't guess it. It is really a rebus.\"  \"If you will wait long enough I can get it, I am sure,\" said Rolf.  \"We seem to have a riddle in every comer,\" said their father. \"I believe we have a riddle-fever, and one catches it from another. We really need a regular guesser in the house, to do nothing but guess riddles.\"  \"I wish I could find such a person,\" said Rolf, sighing, for to be forever making riddles for somebody who would listen with interest and guess with intelligence, seemed to him the most desirable thing in the world.  When dinner was over, the family went merrily into the garden under the apple-tree, and seated themselves in a circle. The mother and Miss Hanenwinkel and the girls were armed with sewing and knitting work. Little Hunne also had a queer-looking bit of stuff in his hand upon which he was trying to work with some red worsted. He said he wanted to embroider a horse-blanket for Jule. Jule had brought a book at his mother's request, to read aloud to them.  Rolf sat a little way off under the ash-tree, and studied his Latin lesson. Wili sat by his side, meaning to study his little piece, but first he looked at the birds in the branches, and then at the laborers in the field, and then at the red apples upon the tree, for Wili loved visible things, and it was only with the greatest difficulty, and generally with Lili's assistance, that he could get the invisible into his little head. Consequently, his afternoon study usually turned to a continuous observation of the surrounding landscape.  Jule also seemed inclined to pass his time in looking about him instead of reading aloud, for he did not open his book, but allowed his eyes to wander in all directions, particularly towards his sister.  \"Paula,\" he said at last, \"the expression of your countenance to-day is as if you were a wandering collection of vexations.\"  \"Oh, do read to us, Jule; then we shall have something more agreeable than these similes which nobody can understand the meaning of.\"  \"It would be nicer if you would read, Jule,\" added her mother, \"but I must say too, Paula, that you have been for the last few days so short and snappish that I should really"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14710"],["title","Uncle Titus and His Visit to the Country (#8)"],["body","to know what is amiss with you. You seem out of sorts with every one about you.\"  \"But mamma, with whom can I have any real companionship? I have not a single friend in all Tannenburg. I have nobody in all the world with whom I can be intimate.\"  The mother suggested that Paula might be a little more friendly with her sister Lili, and also with Miss Hanenwinkel. But Paula declared, that Lili was much too young, and the governess much too old. The latter was really only twenty, but to Paula she seemed very old indeed. For girls to be intimate, she declared they must be of the same age, so that they could thoroughly understand each other's feelings, and they must be always together. Without such a friend Paula said there was no real pleasure in life, for a girl needed some one to whom she could confide her secrets, and who would tell her own in return.  \"Yes, Paula is at the romantic age,\" said her brother. \"I am sure that for a long time she has peeped into every field flower to see if it would not suddenly unfurl a hidden banner, and turn into a Joan of Arc. Every little mole that she sees in the fields, she half suspects may wear a seal-ring on his little finger, and be a Gustavus Vasa in disguise, searching amid the mole-hills for his lost kingdom.\"  \"Do not be so teasing, Jule,\" said his mother reprovingly. \"There is certainly something very delightful in such an intimacy as Paula describes. I had such an experience myself, and the memory of that happy time is dear to me even now!\"  \"Oh, do tell us again about your dear friend Lili, mamma,\" exclaimed Paula, who had often heard her mother speak of this intimate friendship, and had indeed formed her own ideal upon that model. Lili also joined her sister in begging for the story, and even more urgently, for she knew nothing about this friend, although she bore the same name.  \"Was not I named for her, mamma?\" she asked, and her mother assented. \"You all know the long manufactory under the hill,\" continued Mrs. Birkenfeld, \"with the large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. Lili, my friend, lived there, and I remember very well the first time I ever saw her.  \"I was about six years old, and I was playing one day in the parsonage garden with my simple dolls, which I set up on flat stones, that I always collected for seats for my children, whenever and wherever I found them. For I had no such outfit for my dolls as you children have now, no sofas and chairs and other furniture. You all know that your grandfather was the pastor in Tannenburg, and we led a very simple life at the parsonage. My playmates, two of the neighbors' children, were standing as usual by me and staring at me while I played, without saying one word. They never seemed to take the interest in my plays that I thought they deserved. They stood and looked at me with their big eyes, no matter what I did, and it was very annoying to me.  \"Well, this evening, I was sitting there, on the ground, with my dolls all placed in a circle, when a lady came into the garden and asked to see my father. Before I could reply, a child whom she was leading by the hand, came running to my side, squatted down by me, and began to examine everything. I had so arranged my stones that each flat one had another stuck into the ground edgewise behind it, so that the doll could be placed leaning back against it as if it were a chair. The child was delighted with this arrangement, and joined in my play at once with the liveliest interest, while on my side I was so charmed with the little stranger's looks and ways, with her pretty floating curls and her sweet voice that I forgot everything else, and looked on bewitched, while she made the dolls say and do all sorts of things that I had never thought of before. I was quite startled when the lady again asked where she could find my father.  \"From that day forth Lili and I were inseparable friends, and a rich and happy life was opened to me in her lovely home, such as I had never known nor thought of. I shall never forget the delightful, untroubled days which I spent in that beautiful house. I was almost as much loved and petted as if I had been Lili's own sister. Her parents had come from North Germany. Her father had been induced to buy the factory by the advice of an acquaintance, and they expected to remain permanently in our neighborhood. Lili was an only child, and having been hitherto without companionship of her own age, she clung to me very closely, and I returned her affection with equal fervor.  \"What good, kind people her parents were! They asked as a great favor that I might make long visits at their house, and my parents allowed me to pass weeks at a time with my newly found friends. Those visits seemed to me like prolonged festivals. Such lovely toys and playthings as Lili had! I had never even dreamed of anything like them. I shall never forget the innumerable figures cut from fashion plates which we used for paper dolls! We each had a large family of them, with all their kindred and relatives, each one fitted with a name, a character and a story of its own. We almost, nay quite, lived in their imaginary lives, and we shared their joys and sorrows as if they had been real.  \"I always returned home laden with gifts, and I was scarcely settled there, when new requests came that I would repeat the visit. When we were a little older we had lessons together, both from a regular teacher and from my father, and when we began to read together, the heroes and heroines of our books were as real to us as our dolls had been, and we lived over their lives and histories again and again. What life and energy Lili had; what freshness and vivacity; my charming Lili, with her flowing brown curls and her laughing eyes!  \"So the years passed, and no thought of coming sorrow and separation crossed our young lives, until one day, when we were nearly twelve years old, my father told me--I remember the very spot in the garden where we were standing at that moment--that Mr. Blank, Lili's father, was about to give up his factory and return to Germany. As I understood, Mr. Blank had been deceived from the very beginning; the business was not in the prosperous condition that had been represented to him, and now he was obliged to give it up, to his great loss. My father was very much disturbed, and he declared that Mr. Blank had been very badly treated, and was consequently ruined.  \"I was broken-hearted. To lose Lili, and to have her lose all her property, were two things which made my life unhappy for a long, long time. The very next day she came to say good-bye. We cried bitterly, for we could not bear to think of living apart, we were so necessary to each other's happiness. We promised to be always true to each other, and to use every effort to meet again; and then we sat down together and composed a last poem, for we had often written verses together. We cut the poem in halves, and took each a half to keep as a token of our lasting union, and as a sign of recognition when we should some day meet again.  \"Lili went away. We wrote to each other for several years, and our friendship continued as fervent as ever. These letters were the only drops of comfort in the monotonous loneliness of my life after I lost Lili. When I was about seventeen, I received a letter which told me that her father had decided to go to America. She promised to write again as soon as they were settled in their new life. I never heard from her again. Whether her letters were lost, or whether the family never staid long enough in one place for her to be able to give me an address, or whether Lili thought that our lives were now so irrevocably separated that we could never hope to resume our intimacy--these are questions that I have often asked myself, but that of course I have had no means of deciding. Perhaps Lili is no longer living; she may have died soon after that very time--I cannot tell. I have mourned her as an irreparable loss, for she was my first, my only intimate girl-friend, and nothing can efface from my mind the memory of her friendship, and of the vast goodness and affection which her family showered upon me. I have inquired for them in every direction, but have never discovered any clue to their existence far or near.\"  The mother was silent; a very sad expression rested upon her face. The children sympathized with her and said one after the other, sorrowfully, \"What a pity, what a pity!\" Little Hunne, however, who had listened very attentively to his mother's story, put his arms lovingly around her, and said,  \"Don't be so sad, mamma dear! I will go to America as soon as I am big enough, and bring your Lili back with me; that I will!\"  Rolf and Wili had drawn near, to hear the story, and presently Rolf said, looking thoughtfully at a strip of paper which he held in his hand,  \"Did your piece of paper with the poem look like a rebus, after you had cut it in two, Mamma?\"  \"Perhaps so, Rolf. I should think it might look like one. Why do you ask?\"  \"Look here! is this it?\" replied the boy, holding up his strip of paper.  \"Yes, yes, it certainly is it,\" cried the mother in great excitement. \"I thought it had been lost long ago. I kept it carefully put away for many years, and then in some way I lost sight of it. I thought it was lost forever. Lately I have not thought of it at all, but telling you the story of my early friendship, brought it again to my mind. Where did you find it, my son?\"  \"We found it!\" cried Wili and Lili triumphantly. \"It was in the old bible with the queer pictures. We thought we would look at Eve, again, to see whether her face was scratched as it used to be.\" The twins talked both together as usual.  \"Yes, that is another thing that brings my Lili to mind,\" said their mother, smiling. \"She scratched that picture once when we were saying how lovely it would be if we were in Paradise together, and suddenly she felt so furious with Eve because she ate the apple, that she"]]]
