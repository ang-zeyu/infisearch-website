Then mamma had to sell the cottage, and she moved here to try to get work to do.\"  11. \"Do you have to sit here all day?\" asked George, glancing around the bare room and out into the dismal street. \"Yes,\" said Jennie, \"because I am lame; but I would not care for that, if I could only help mamma.\"  12. \"I declare, it's too had!\" said George, who dreaded nothing so much as being obliged to stay in the house. \"Oh, no, it isn't,\" said Jennie, pleasantly; \"mamma says maybe we should forget the Lord if we had everything we wanted, and He never forgets us, you know.\"  13. \"Well, I must rush for school,\" said George, not knowing exactly what to say next; and he was soon out of Jennie's sight, but had a happy little corner in his heart, because he had tried to do a kind act. He did not know how much good he had done in making a pleasant day out of a dreary one for a little sick girl.  14. \"Mamma,\" said George, that evening, after he had told her what Jennie said, \"papa must give them some money, so they can go back to their home.\"  15. \"No,\" said his mother; \"he can not do that, and they would not wish him to do so; but perhaps he can help us contrive some way to assist them, so that they can live more comfortably.\"  16. \"I am going to carry Jennie some of the grapes grandpa sent me, to-morrow,\" said George, turning over the leaves of his geography. \"I will put some of my pears into your basket, and go with you,\" said his mother; \"but there is one thing we can always give, and sometimes it does more good than nice things to eat, or even money.\"  17. \"What is that, mamma,--smiles?\" asked George, looking up. \"Yes,\" answered his mother; \"and it is a good plan to throw in a kind word or two with them when you can.\"   DEFINITIONS.-l. Dis'mal, gloomy, cheerless. Wish'ful-ly, with desire. 5. Rick'et-y, imperfect, worn out. 7. Din'gy, dark. 11. Glan'cing, looking about quickly. 13. Drear'y, comfortless, gloomy. 15. Con-trive', to plan.   EXERCISES.--What is the subject of this lesson? How did George West make the day pleasant for Jennie? What did his mother suggest? What happened next day? What did Jennie tell George about her life? Relate what happened at George's home that evening. What does the lesson teach?    VII. LAZY NED. (38)  1. \"'T is royal fun,\" cried lazy Ned,    \"To coast, upon my fine, new sled,      And beat the other boys;    But then, I can not bear to climb    The tiresome hill, for every time      It more and more annoys.\"  2. So, while his schoolmates glided by,    And gladly tugged uphill, to try      Another merry race,    Too indolent to share their plays,    Ned was compelled to stand and gaze,      While shivering in his place.  3. Thus, he would never take the pains    To seek the prize that labor gains,      Until the time had passed;    For, all his life, he dreaded still    The silly bugbear of uphill,      And died a dunce at last.   DEFINITIONS.-l. Roy'al, excellent, noble. Coast, to slide. An--noys', troubles. 2. In'do-lent, lazy. 3. Prize, a reward. Bug-bear, something frightful. Dunce, a silly fellow.   EXERCISES.--What did Ned like? What did he not like?    VIII. THE MONKEY. (39)  1. The monkey is a very cunning little animal, and is found in many parts of the world.  2. A lady once had a monkey, which had been brought to her as a present. This monkey, like all others, was very fond of mischief and of doing whatever he saw others do.  3. His mistress found him one day sitting on her toilet table, holding in one hand a little china mug with water in it, and in the other her toothbrush, with which he was cleaning his teeth, looking all the time in the glass.  4. Her little daughter, Maria, had a large doll with a very handsome head and face. She one day left this doll in the cradle, and went out of the room. The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and jumping upon the washstand, he began to wash its face.  5. He first rubbed it all over with soap. Then seizing the towel, he dipped it in the wash bowl, and rubbed it so hard that the doll's face was entirely spoiled, the paint being all washed off.  6. There have been many tales of monkeys who, armed with sticks, have joined together and made war or resisted their enemies with great effect. These are not true, as it is known that in their native state monkeys have no idea of weapons.  7. The sticks and other missiles said to be thrown at travelers as they pass under the branches of trees, are usually the dead branches, etc., accidentally broken off, as the monkeys, with the natural curiosity of their tribe, pass along the tops of trees to watch the actions of the people below.  8. They can, however, be taught to use a stick, and to use it well. Some time ago, two Italians together owned an organ and a monkey, by means of which they earned their living. During one of their exhibitions, a dog flew at the little monkey, which made its owners very angry.  9. They and the owner of the dog quarreled about it, and at last it was agreed that the dog and the monkey should fight it out; the monkey, because he was smaller, was to be allowed a stick.  10. The monkey was taught what he was to do in the following manner: One of the Italians crawled on his hands and knees, barking like a dog, while the other got on his back, grasped his hair, and beat him about the head with a stick.  11. The monkey looked on with great gravity, and, when the instruction was over, received the stick with the air of a man who knew his work and meant to do it.  12. Everything being settled the dog flew at the monkey with open month. The monkey immediately leaped on his back, and, grasping the dog's ear, beat away at his head with such good will that his adversary speedily gave in. The monkey, however, was not content with a mere victory, but continued pounding at the dog's head until he left him senseless on the ground.   DEFINITIONS.--1. Cun'ning, sly. 3. Toi'let ta'ble, dressing table. 6. Re-sist'ed, opposed. 7. Mis'siles, weapons thrown. 8. Ex-hi-bi'tions, public shows. 11. Grav'i-ty, seriousness. In-struc'-tion, lesson, 12. Sense'less, without apparent life.   EXERCISES.--What kind of an animal is a monkey? Where did the lady find the monkey one day? What was he doing? What did he do with Maria's doll? Do monkeys in their native state know how to use sticks as weapons? Can they be taught to use them? Relate the story of the two Italians. What is the meaning of \"etc.\" in the seventh paragraph?    IX. MEDDLESOME MATTY. (42)  1. Oh, how one ugly trick has spoiled      The sweetest and the best!    Matilda, though a pleasant child,      One grievous fault possessed,    Which, like a cloud before the skies,    Hid all her better qualities.  2. Sometimes, she'd lift the teapot lid      To peep at what was in it;    Or tilt, the kettle, if you did      But turn your back a minute.    In vain you told her not to touch,    Her trick of meddling grew so much.  3. Her grand mamma went out one day,      And, by mistake, she laid    Her spectacles and snuffbox gay,      Too near the little maid;    \"Ah! well,\" thought she, \"I'll try them on,    As soon as grand mamma is gone.\"  4. Forthwith, she placed upon her nose      The glasses large and wide;    And looking round, as I suppose,      The snuffbox, too, she spied.    \"Oh, what a pretty box is this!    I'll open it,\" said little miss.  5. \"I know that grandmamma would say,      'Don't meddle with it, dear;'    But then she's far enough away,      And no one else is near;    Beside, what can there be amiss    In opening such a box as this?\"  6. So, thumb and finger went to work      To move the stubborn lid;    And, presently, a mighty jerk      The mighty mischief did;    For all at once, ah! woeful case!    The snuff came puffing in her face.  7. Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, and chin      A dismal sight presented;    And as the snuff got further in,      Sincerely she repented.    In vain she ran about for ease,    She could do nothing else but sneeze.  8. She dashed the spectacles away,      To wipe her tingling eyes;    And, as in twenty bits they lay,      Her grandmamma she spies.    \"Heyday! and what's the matter now?\"    Cried grandmamma, with angry brow.  9. Matilda, smarting with the pain,      And tingling still, and sore,    Made many a promise to refrain      From meddling evermore;    And 't is a fact, as I have heard,    She ever since has kept her word.   DEFINITIONS.-l. Qual'i-ties, traits of character. 2. Med'-dling, interfering without right. 4. Forth-with', at once. Spied, saw. 5. A-miss', wrong, faulty. 6. Woe'ful, sad, sorrowful 8. Tin'gling, smarting. 9. Re-frain', to keep from.   EXERCISES.--What did Matilda do? How was she punished?  What effect did it have on her?    X. THE GOOD SON. (44)  1. There was once a jeweler, noted for many virtues. One day, the Jewish elders came to him to buy some diamonds, to put upon that part of the dress of their high priest, which the Bible calls an ephod.  2. They told him what they wanted, and offered him a fair price for the diamonds. He replied that he could not let them see the jewels at that moment, and requested them to call again.  3. As they wanted them without delay, and thought that the object of the jeweler was only to increase the price of the diamonds, the elders offered him twice, then three times, as much as they were worth. But he still refused, and they went away in very bad humor.  4. Some hours after, he went to them, and placed before them the diamonds, for which they again offered him the last price they had named; but he said, \"I will only accept the first one you offered to me this morning.\"  5. \"Why, then, did you not close with us at once?\" asked they in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],["title","McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#6)"],["body","rprise. \"When you came,\" replied he, \"my father had the key of the chest, in which the diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I should have been obliged to wake him to obtain them.  6. \"At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a great deal of good; and for all the gold in the world, I would not be wanting in respect to my father, or take from him a single comfort.\"  7. The elders, affected by these feeling words, spread their hands upon the jeweler's head, and said, \"Thou shalt be blessed of Him who has said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother;' and thy children shall one day pay thee the same respect and love thou hast shown to thy father.\"   DEFINITIONS.--l. Jew'el-er, one who buys and sells precious stones. Not'ed, well known. Eld'er, an officer of the Jewish church.

What did the elders say to him, when they heard his reason for not giving them the diamonds at first?    XI. TO-MORROW. (45)  Mrs. M. B. Johnson is the authoress of  \"To-morrow,\" one of a collection of poems; entitled \"Poems of Home Life.\"  1. A bright, merry boy, with laughing face,    Whose every motion was full of grace,    Who knew no trouble and feared no care,    Was the light of our household--the youngest there.  2. He was too young, this little elf,    With troublesome questions to vex himself;    But for many days a thought would rise,    And bring a shade to his dancing eyes.  3. He went to one whom he thought more wise    Than any other beneath the skies;    \"Mother,\"--O word that makes the home!--    \"Tell me, when will to-morrow come?\"  4. \"It is almost night,\" the mother said,    \"And time for my boy to be in bed;    When you wake up and it's day again,    It will be to-morrow, my darling, then.\"  5. The little boy slept through all the night,    But woke with the first red streak of light;    He pressed a kiss to his mother's brow,    And whispered, \"Is it to-morrow now?\"  6. \"No, little Eddie, this is to-day:    To-morrow is always one night away.\"    He pondered a while, but joys came fast,    And this vexing question quickly passed.  7. But it came again with the shades of night;    \"Will it be to-morrow when it is light?\"    From years to come he seemed care to borrow,    He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.  8. \"You can not catch it, my little Ted;    Enjoy to-day,\" the mother said;    \"Some wait for to-morrow through many a year    It is always coming, but never is here.\"   DEFINITIONS.--1. House'hold,  family, those living in the same house. 2. Elf, a small fairy-like person. Vex, worry, trouble. Pon'dered, thought anxiously. A-while', for a short time.

What troubled Eddie? Can you define tomorrow? What did Eddie's mother advise him to do?    XII. WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY. (47)  1. Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His mother found it difficult to provide for the support of a large family, thus left entirely in her care. By good management, however, she contrived to do so, and also to send Henry, the oldest, to school, and to supply him, for the most part, with such books as he needed.  2. At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a class in that study, and his mother could not furnish him with the money to buy it. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with a heavy heart, thinking what could be done.  3. On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen, and the cold wind was blowing furiously. \"Ah,\" said he, \"it is an ill wind that blows nobody good.\"  4. He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service to clear a path around his premises. The offer was accepted. Having completed this work, and received his pay, he went to another place for the same purpose, and then to another, until he had earned enough to buy a grammar.  5. When school commenced, Henry was in his seat, the happiest boy there, ready to begin the lesson in his new book.  6. From that time, Henry, was always the first in all his classes. He knew no such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted. Having the will, he always found the way.   DEFINITIONS.--l. Man'age-ment, manner of directing things. 2. Fur'nish, to supply. 3. Fu'ri-ous-ly, violently. 4. Serv'ice, labor. Prem'i-ses, grounds around a house.    XIII. PICCOLA. (48)  By Celia Laighton Thaxter, who was born at Portsmouth, N. H., June 29, 1836. Much of her childhood was passed at White Island, one of the Isles of Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire. \"Among the Isles of Shoals,\" is her most noted work in prose. She published a volume of poems, many of which are favorites with children. She died in 1894.  1. Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear    What happened to Piccola, children dear?    'T is seldom Fortune such favor grants    As fell to this little maid of France.  2. 'T was Christmas time, and her parents poor    Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,    Striving with poverty's patient pain    Only to live till summer again.  3. No gift for Piccola! sad were they    When dawned the morning of Christmas day!    Their little darling no joy might stir;    St. Nicholas nothing would bring to her!  4. But Piccola never doubted at all    That something beautiful must befall    Every child upon Christmas day,    And so she slept till the dawn was gray.  5. And full of faith, when at last she woke,    She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;    Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,    'T was plain St. Nicholas had been there.  6. In rushed Piccola, sweet, half wild--    Never was seen such a joyful child--    \"See what the good saint brought!\" she cried,    And mother and father must peep inside.  7. Now such a story I never heard!    There was a little shivering bird!    A sparrow, that in at the window flew,    Had crept into Piccola's tiny shoe!  8. \"How good poor Piccola must have been!\"    She cried, as happy as any queen,    While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,    And danced with rapture, she was so charmed.  9. Children, this story I tell to you    Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.    In the far-off land of France, they say,    Still do they live to this very day.   DEFINITIONS.--3. Dawned, began to grow light. Stir, excite. 4. Be-fall, happen. 7. Shiv'er-ing, trembling from cold. Ti'ny, very small. 8. Rapture, great joy. Charmed, greatly.   EXERCISES.--What is meant by \"driving the wolf from the door\"? In the third stanza, what does \"St.\" before Nicholas mean? Who is St. Nicholas?

JOHNSON.--(ADAPTED.)  1. \"Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand,\" said Fred Liscom, a bright, active boy twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted.  2. She smiled, and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\" \"Yes, indeed, mother,\" replied Fred; \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\"  3. A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking-chair. Fred washed the dishes, and put them in the closet. He then swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.  4. Fred's father was away from home, and as there was some cold meat in the pantry, Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.  5. He kept on in this way for two or three days, till his mother was able to resume her usual work, and he felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\"  6. The doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection.  7. Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school, and staying to play after it was dismissed.  8. The boys missed him, and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was a \"wanted at home.\" \"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton, \"I'll find him out, boys--see if I don't!\"  9. So he called for Fred to go to school, and on his way to the side door walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was absolutely needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand.  10. Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess. \"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes.\" \"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\" \"Lost your apron, have n't you, Polly!\"  11. Fred was not wanting either in spirit or courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors. But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.  12. While he was struggling for self mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, \"Don't give up! Be really brave!\" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.  13. The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted or teased in any manner."]]]
