They came upon the water, and under the water, and even in the air. They came in great numbers, so that they rolled across the land like a great gray fog. They brought with them thunder and lightning and smoke that killed, and they fell upon us and slew our people by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands. But at last we drove them back to the waterl’s edge, back into the sea, where many were drowned. Some escaped, and these our people followed—men, women, and even children, we followed them back. That is all. The legend says our people never returned. Maybe they were all killed. Maybe they are still there. But this, also, is in the legend, that as we drove the men back across the water they swore that they would return, and that when they left our shores they would leave no human being alive behind them. I was afraid that you were from there.”  “By what name were these men called?” I asked.  “We call them only the ‘men from there,’” she replied, pointing toward the east. “I have never heard that they had another name.”  In the light of what I knew of ancient history, it was not difficult for me to guess the nationality of those she described simply as “the men from over there.” But what utter and appalling devastation the Great War must have wrought to have erased not only every sign of civilization from the face of this great land, but even the name of the enemy from the knowledge and language of the people.  I could only account for it on the hypothesis that the country had been entirely depopulated except for a few scattered and forgotten children, who, in some marvelous manner, had been preserved by Providence to re-populate the land. These children had, doubtless, been too young to retain in their memories to transmit to their children any but the vaguest suggestion of the cataclysm which had overwhelmed their parents.  Professor Cortoran, since my return to Pan-America, has suggested another theory which is not entirely without claim to serious consideration. He points out that it is quite beyond the pale of human instinct to desert little children as my theory suggests the ancient English must have done. He is more inclined to believe that the expulsion of the foe from England was synchronous with widespread victories by the allies upon the continent, and that the people of England merely emigrated from their ruined cities and their devastated, blood-drenched fields to the mainland, in the hope of finding, in the domain of the conquered enemy, cities and farms which would replace those they had lost.  The learned professor assumes that while a long-continued war had strengthened rather than weakened the instinct of paternal devotion, it had also dulled other humanitarian instincts, and raised to the first magnitude the law of the survival of the fittest, with the result that when the exodus took place the strong, the intelligent, and the cunning, together with their offspring, crossed the waters of the Channel or the North Sea to the continent, leaving in unhappy England only the helpless inmates of asylums for the feebleminded and insane.  My objections to this, that the present inhabitants of England are mentally fit, and could therefore not have descended from an ancestry of undiluted lunacy he brushes aside with the assertion that insanity is not necessarily hereditary; and that even though it was, in many cases a return to natural conditions from the state of high civilization, which is thought to have induced mental disease in the ancient world, would, after several generations, have thoroughly expunged every trace of the affliction from the brains and nerves of the descendants of the original maniacs.  Personally, I do not place much stock in Professor Cortoranl’s theory, though I admit that I am prejudiced. Naturally one does not care to believe that the object of his greatest affection is descended from a gibbering idiot and a raving maniac.  But I am forgetting the continuity of my narrative—a continuity which I desire to maintain, though I fear that I shall often be led astray, so numerous and varied are the bypaths of speculation which lead from the present day story of the Grabritins into the mysterious past of their forbears.  As I stood talking with the girl I presently recollected that she still was bound, and with a word of apology, I drew my knife and cut the rawhide thongs which confined her wrists at her back.  She thanked me, and with such a sweet smile that I should have been amply repaid by it for a much more arduous service.  “And now,” I said, “let me accompany you to your home and see you safely again under the protection of your friends.”  “No,” she said, with a hint of alarm in her voice; “you must not come with me—Buckingham will kill you.”  Buckingham. The name was famous in ancient English history. Its survival, with many other illustrious names, is one of the strongest arguments in refutal of Professor Cortoranl’s theory; yet it opens no new doors to the past, and, on the whole, rather adds to than dissipates the mystery.  “And who is Buckingham,” I asked, “and why should he wish to kill me?”  “He would think that you had stolen me,” she replied, “and as he wishes me for himself, he will kill any other whom he thinks desires me. He killed Wettin a few days ago. My mother told me once that Wettin was my father. He was king. Now Buckingham is king.”  Here, evidently, were a people slightly superior to those of the Isle of Wight. These must have at least the rudiments of civilized government since they recognized one among them as ruler, with the title, king. Also, they retained the word father. The girl’s pronunciation, while far from identical with ours, was much closer than the tortured dialect of the Eastenders of the Isle of Wight. The longer I talked with her the more hopeful I became of finding here, among her people, some records, or traditions, which might assist in clearing up the historic enigma of the past two centuries. I asked her if we were far from the city of London, but she did not know what I meant. When I tried to explain, describing mighty buildings of stone and brick, broad avenues, parks, palaces, and countless people, she but shook her head sadly.  “There is no such place near by,” she said. “Only the Camp of the Lions has places of stone where the beasts lair, but there are no people in the Camp of the Lions. Who would dare go there!” And she shuddered.  “The Camp of the Lions,” I repeated. “And where is that, and what?”  “It is there,” she said, pointing up the river toward the west. “I have seen it from a great distance, but I have never been there. We are much afraid of the lions, for this is their country, and they are angry that man has come to live here.  “Far away there,” and she pointed toward the south-west, “is the land of tigers, which is even worse than this, the land of the lions, for the tigers are more numerous than the lions and hungrier for human flesh. There were tigers here long ago, but both the lions and the men set upon them and drove them off.”  “Where did these savage beasts come from?” I asked.  “Oh,” she replied, “they have been here always. It is their country.”  “Do they not kill and eat your people?” I asked.  “Often, when we meet them by accident, and we are too few to slay them, or when one goes too close to their camp. But seldom do they hunt us, for they find what food they need among the deer and wild cattle, and, too, we make them gifts, for are we not intruders in their country? Really we live upon good terms with them, though I should not care to meet one were there not many spears in my party.”  “I should like to visit this Camp of the Lions,” I said.  “Oh, no, you must not!” cried the girl. “That would be terrible. They would eat you.” For a moment, then, she seemed lost in thought, but presently she turned upon me with: “You must go now, for any minute Buckingham may come in search of me. Long since should they have learned that I am gone from the camp—they watch over me very closely—and they will set out after me. Go! I shall wait here until they come in search of me.”  “No,” I told her. “I’ll not leave you alone in a land infested by lions and other wild beasts. If you won’t let me go as far as your camp with you, then I’ll wait here until they come in search of you.”  “Please go!” she begged. “You have saved me, and I would save you, but nothing will save you if Buckingham gets his hands on you. He is a bad man. He wishes to have me for his woman so that he may be king. He would kill anyone who befriended me, for fear that I might become anotherl’s.”  “Didn’t you say that Buckingham is already the king?” I asked.  “He is. He took my mother for his woman after he had killed Wettin. But my mother will die soon—she is very old—and then the man to whom I belong will become king.”  Finally, after much questioning, I got the thing through my head. It appears that the line of descent is through the women. A man is merely head of his wife’s family—that is all. If she chances to be the oldest female member of the “royal” house, he is king. Very naively the girl explained that there was seldom any doubt as to whom a childl’s mother was.  This accounted for the girl’s importance in the community and for Buckinghaml’s anxiety to claim her, though she told me that she did not wish to become his woman, for he was a bad man and would make a bad king. But he was powerful, and there was no other man who dared dispute his wishes.  “Why not come with me,” I suggested, “if you do not wish to become Buckinghaml’s?”  “Where would you take me?” she asked.  Where, indeed! I had not thought of that. But before I could reply to her question she shook her head and said, “No, I cannot leave my people. I must stay and do my best, even if Buckingham gets me, but you must go at once. Do not wait until it is too late.

L. Burt Company Publishers New York Chicago  1911        CHAPTER I.      \"For wild, or calm, or far or near,      I love thee still, thou glorious sea.\"                       --Mrs. Hemans.      \"I bless thee for kind looks and words       Shower'd on my path like dew,      For all the love in those deep eyes,       A gladness ever new.\"                       --Mrs. Hemans.   It is late in the afternoon of a delicious October day; the woods back of the two cottages where the Dinsmores, Travillas and Raymonds have spent the last three or four months are gorgeous with scarlet, crimson and gold; the air from the sea is more delightful than ever, but the summer visitors to the neighboring cottages and hotels have fled, and the beach is almost deserted, as Edward and his child-wife wander slowly along it, hand in hand, their attention divided between the splendors of a magnificent sunset and the changing beauty of the sea; yonder away in the distance it is pale gray; near at hand delicate green slowly changing to pink, each wave crested with snowy foam, and anon they all turn to burnished gold.  \"Oh, how very beautiful!\" cries Zoe, in an ecstasy of delight. \"Edward, did you ever see anything finer?\"  \"Never! Let us go down this flight of steps and seat ourselves on the next to the lowest. We will then be quite near the waves and yet out of danger of being wet by them.\"  He led her down as he spoke, seated her comfortably and himself by her side with his arm around her.  \"I've grown very fond of the sea,\" she remarked. \"I shall be sorry to leave it. Will not you?\"  \"Yes and no,\" he answered, doubtfully. \"I, too, am fond of old ocean, but eager to get to Ion and begin life in earnest. Isn't it time, seeing I have been a married man for nearly five months? But why that sigh, love?\"  \"O Edward, are you not sorry you are married? Are you not sometimes very much ashamed of me?\" she asked, her cheek burning hotly and the downcast eyes filling with tears.  \"Ashamed of you, Zoe? Why, darling, you are my heart's best treasure,\" he said, drawing her closer to his side, and touching his lips to her forehead. \"What has put so absurd an idea into your head?\"  \"I know so little, so very little compared with your mother and sisters,\" she sighed. \"I'm finding it out more and more every day, as I hear them talk among themselves and to other people.\"  \"But you are younger than any of them, a very great deal younger than mamma, and will have time to catch up to them.\"  \"But I'm a married woman and so can't go to school any more. Ah,\" with another and very heavy sigh, \"I wish papa hadn't been quite so indulgent, or that I'd had sense enough not to take advantage of it to the neglect of my studies!\"  \"No, I suppose it would hardly do to send you to school, even if I could spare you--which I can't,\" he returned laughingly, \"but there is a possibility of studying at home, under a governess or tutor. What do you say to offering yourself as a pupil to grandpa?\"  \"Oh, no, no! I'm sure he can be very stern upon occasion. I've seen it in his eyes when I've made a foolish remark that he didn't approve, and I should be too frightened to learn if he were my teacher.\"  \"Then some one else must be thought of,\" Edward said, with a look of amusement. \"How would I answer?\"  \"You? Oh, splendidly!\"  \"You are not afraid of me?\"  \"No, indeed!\" she cried, with a merry laugh and a saucy look up into his face.  \"And yet I'm the only person who has authority over you.\"  \"Authority, indeed!\" with a little contemptuous sniff.  \"You promised to obey, you know.\"  \"Did I? Well, maybe so, but that's just a form that doesn't really mean anything. Most any married woman will tell you that.\"  \"Do you consider the whole of your marriage vow an unmeaning form, Zoe?\" he asked, with sudden gravity and a look of doubt and pain in his eyes that she could not bear to see.  \"No, no! I was only in jest,\" she said, dropping her eyes and blushing deeply. \"But really, Edward, you don't think, do you, that wives are to obey like children?\"  \"No, love, I don't; and I think in a true marriage the two are so entirely one--so unselfishly desirous each to please the other--that there is little or no clashing of wills. Thus far ours has seemed such to me. How is it, do you think, little wife?\"  \"I hope so, Edward,\" she said, laying her head on his shoulder, \"I know one thing--that there is nothing in this world I care so much for as to please you and be all and everything to you.\"  \"And I can echo your words from my very heart, dearest,\" he said, caressing her. \"I hope you are at home and happy among your new relatives.\"  \"Yes, indeed, Edward, especially with mamma. She is the dearest, kindest mother in the world; to me as much as to her own children, and oh, so wise and good!\"  \"You are not sorry now that you and I are not to live alone?\" he queried, with a pleased smile.  \"No, oh, no! I'm ever so glad that she is to keep house at Ion and all of us to live together as one family.\"  \"Except Lester and Elsie,\" he corrected; \"they will be with us for a short time, then go to Fairview for the winter. And it will probably become their home after that, as mamma will buy it, if Mr. Leland--Lester's uncle, who owns the place--carries out his intention of removing to California. His children have settled there, and, of course, the father and mother want to be with them.\"  The sun had set, and all the bright hues had faded from the sea, leaving it a dull gray.  \"What a deserted spot this seems!\" remarked Zoe, \"and only the other day it was gay with crowds of people. Nobody to be seen now but ourselves,\" glancing up and down the coast as she spoke. \"Ah, yes! yonder is someone sitting on that piece of wreck.\"  \"It is Lulu Raymond,\" Edward said, following the direction of her glance. \"It is late for the child to be out so far from home; a full mile I should say. I'll go and invite her to walk back with us.\"  \"No, you needn't,\" said Zoe, \"for see, there is her father going to her. But let us go home, for I must change my dress before tea.\"  \"And we want time to walk leisurely along,\" returned Edward, rising and giving her his hand to help her up the steps.  Lulu was reading, so absorbed in the story that she did not perceive her father's approach, and as he accosted her with, \"It is late for you to be here alone, my child, you should have come in an hour ago,\" she gave a great start, and involuntarily tried to hide her book.  \"What have you there? Evidently something you do not wish your father to see,\" he said, bending down and taking it from her unwilling hand.  \"Ah, I don't wonder!\" as he hurriedly turned over a few pages. \"A dime novel! Where did you get this, Lulu?\"  \"It's Max's, papa, he lent it to me. O papa, what made you do that?\" as with an energetic fling the captain suddenly sent it far out into the sea. \"Max made me promise to take care of it and give it back to him, and besides I wanted to finish the story.\"  \"Neither you nor Max shall ever read such poisonous stuff as that with my knowledge and consent,\" replied the captain in stern accents.  \"Papa, I didn't think you'd be so unkind,\" grumbled Lulu, her face expressing extreme vexation and disappointment, \"or that you would throw away other people's things.\"  \"Unkind, my child?\" he said, sitting down beside her and taking her hand in his. \"Suppose you had gathered a quantity of beautiful, sweet-tasted berries that I knew to be poisonous, and were about to eat them; would it be unkind in me to snatch them out of your hand and throw them into the sea?\"  \"No, sir; because it would kill me to eat them, but that book couldn't kill me, or even make me sick.\"  \"No, not your body, but it would injure your soul, which is worth far more. I'm afraid I have been too negligent in regard to the mental food of my children,\" he went on after a slight pause, rather as if thinking aloud than talking to Lulu, \"and unfortunately I cannot take the oversight of it constantly in the future. But remember, Lulu,\" he added firmly, \"I wholly forbid dime novels, and you are not to read anything without first obtaining the approval of your father or one of those under whose authority he has placed you.\"  Lulu's face was full of sullen discontent and anger. \"Papa,\" she said, \"I don't like to obey those people.\"  \"If you are wise, you will try to like what has to be,\" he said.  \"It wouldn't have to be if you would only say I needn't, papa.\"  \"I shall not say that, Lucilla,\" he answered with grave displeasure. \"You need guidance and control even more than most children of your age, and I should not be doing my duty if I left you without them.\"  \"I don't like to obey people that are no relation to me!\" she cried, viciously kicking away a little heap of sand.  \"No, you don't even like to obey your father,\" he said with a sigh. \"Max and Gracie together do not give me half the anxiety that you do by your wilful temper.\"  \"Why, can't I do as I please as well as grown people?\" she asked in a more subdued tone.  \"Even grown people have to obey,\" said her father. \"I am now expecting orders from the government, and must obey them when they come. I must obey my superior officers, and the officers and men under me must obey me. So must my children. God gave you to me and requires me to train you up in His fear and service to the best of my ability. I should not be doing that if I allowed you to read such hurtful trash as that I just took from you.\"  \"It was Max's, papa, and I promised to give it back. What shall I say when he asks me for it?\"  \"Tell him to come to me about it.\"  \"Papa----\"  \"Well, what is it?\" he asked, as she paused and hesitated.  \"Please, papa, don't punish him. You never told him not to buy or read such things, did you?\"  \"No; and I think he would not have done so in defiance of a"]]]
