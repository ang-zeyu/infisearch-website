When they had looked their fill at all these they left the castle for the village surrounding it, which consisted of reproductions of very old German houses with small porticos and sharp gables.  These covered three or four acres of ground and were built around a court, in the centre of which was a music stand where a band of twenty musicians, in white uniforms and military caps, were almost constantly playing upon their instruments, making such delightful music that crowds of people flocked to hear them.  Our friends enjoyed it greatly, and for a time did nothing but stay there and listen while watching the players and the crowd.  But the children began to show signs of weariness and the captain, Violet, Grandma Elsie, and several of the others rose and moved on with them into a cottage which stood in the back part of the grounds.  It was a picturesque-looking building and there were a number of Germans in and about it, many of them evidently sight-seers like our friends. It was furnished in truly German style, with quaint old-fashioned mantels, holding old pieces of bric-a-brac, and quaint dishes and cabinets hanging on the walls.  One room on the left as they entered seemed to be attracting particular attention, and they presently turned to it, paused an instant at the open door, then walked in, the captain and Violet with their two little ones leading the way.  The principal objects in the apartment were two wax figures, life size, representing a man and woman seated at a table apparently dining together.  Our party stood for a moment silently gazing, then Mr. Lilburn and Walter Travilla followed them into the room, though hardly seeming to belong to their party.  Catching sight of the figures at the table, Walter nudged the old gentleman, gave him a significant, laughing glance, then stepping forward addressed the waxen man in a serious tone as though he thought him a living person.  \"Excuse me, sir, but I am a stranger here and would like to ask a little information in regard to what may be seen that is really worth looking at.\"  At that there was a general laugh among the other spectators, and an exchange of glances that seemed to say he must be either very blind or extremely simple.  Walter did not seem to notice, however, but went on: \"Are the upper floors open to visitors, sir? and are there refreshments served there, or in any other part of the building?\"  At that the laugh among the people in the room and about the doorway grew louder,--it seemed so good a joke that anyone should take those wax figures for living people--and a burly German, taking pity on Walter's stupidity, said; \"Mine frient, dose vos vax beobles, ha, ha, ha! dey don't can't say nodings.\"  With that the laughter grew louder, and another German, evidently good-naturedly desirous to relieve Walter's embarrassment, spoke, turning as he did so to the first speaker:  \"Dat vasn't no sign de young shentlemans vas dumb; he don't can't help it; he t'ot dey vas life beoples.\"  \"Nefer you mine dose silly fellows, young shentleman, dey doan' know noddings.\"  The words seemed to come from the lips of the waxen man, and struck the crowd with astonishment. \"I would tell you vat you vants to know,\" he added, \"but I pees von stranger in dose barts mineself.\"  Then the woman seemed to speak: \"Come to de dable, mine frient, and eat somedings mit us.\"  \"Thank you, very much,\" returned Walter, \"you are most kind and hospitable, but I cannot think of intruding upon your hospitality.\" And with a bow directed toward her and her spouse, he turned and left the room, the rest of his party following and leaving the little crowd of Germans gazing at each other and the waxen figures in wide-eyed, open-mouthed astonishment.  \"Papa,\" complained little Ned as they left the German quarter, \"I'm so tired and sleepy.\"  \"Hungry, too, papa's boy, aren't you?\" was the kindly enquiring rejoinder. \"Well, papa will take you back to our floating home, and leave you there with your nurse to be fed and have a good, long nap. I think Elsie would like to go too. Wouldn't you, daughter?\"  The little girl gave a glad assent, and arranging with his wife and older daughters where to meet them on his return, the captain set off with the two little ones for the _Dolphin_.     CHAPTER VII.   Captain Raymond was not gone very long, and on his return found the others sitting quietly listening to the music of the German band. But they were ready to go at his invitation and test the excellence of the fare to be obtained at the Woman's Building.  \"There are _cafés_ at each end of the roof covered with Oriental awnings,\" he said, \"and surely we may expect as good fare at a woman's establishment as anywhere else.\"  \"I think we certainly should,\" said Rosie in a sprightly tone; \"and there must be a lovely view or views from that roof and the loggias.\"  \"Doubtless,\" returned the captain, \"and though we visited all the lower apartments of the building the other day, we did not go up to the roof; so that a visit to it will have for us the charm of novelty.\"  \"Yes,\" said Grandma Elsie; \"let us go by boat up the lagoon. Gracie looks as if she needed a rest from walking, and I confess I should not object to it myself.\"  The words had scarcely left her lips before Harold had signalled a boat, and the whole party was presently seated in it.  A short but delightful row brought them to the landing in front of the Woman's Building, and climbing the stone stairway that led up to the terrace, they passed through the triple-arched colonnade that led into the interior of the building, nor paused till they had reached one of the _cafés_, where they might rest and also satisfy their appetites with the good things abundantly provided.  Those important matters duly attended to, some minutes were given to the enjoyment of the fine views to be obtained from the loggias, and looking at the statues of Miss Rideout, representing Sacrifice, Charity, Virtue, and Wisdom. They then spent a short time over the exhibit in the lower part of the building; and there Captain Raymond and Lucilla met with a pleasant surprise in coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon Mr. Austin and his son Albert, the English gentleman whose acquaintance they had made in their visit to Minersville some years before.  The pleasure was evidently mutual; very hearty greetings were exchanged, then Captain Raymond introduced his accompanying friends, and Mr. Austin a daughter who was with him.  A few moments were spent in conversation, in the course of which an invitation was extended to the Austins to take supper upon the yacht that evening, and they parted for a time; the Austins having an engagement to meet some friends in the meanwhile in another part of the Fair.  \"Shall we go now to the Electrical Building?\" asked Captain Raymond, addressing his party, and receiving a hearty assent from all, he led the way.  They found much in the building to greatly interest them; great electric lenses used in lighthouses, the Edison electric column--covered with five thousand electric globes--and many other wonderful things; a beautiful scene in the daytime, but far more gorgeous at night, as they readily perceived that it would be; so they decided to pay a second visit after the lighting up that evening. Still their present visit was so prolonged that on leaving they found it time to return to the yacht. They met the Austins again at the Peristyle, and took them on board in the first boat load.  The guests were numerous, including all the cousins from Pleasant Plains, and the three young gentlemen friends--Chester and Frank Dinsmore and Will Croly. The meal to which they presently sat down, though Captain Raymond had called it supper, was an excellent dinner of several courses, and enlivened by pleasant chat, proved most enjoyable to the entire company.  At its conclusion they adjourned to the deck. A pleasant air was stirring, the sun drawing near his setting, the western sky glowing with brilliant hues, while the sounds of life on water and land came softly to the ear.  The young people formed one group, the older ones another, conversing among themselves, mostly in rather subdued tones.  \"You have hardly been in America ever since I saw you last?\" Lucilla said enquiringly, addressing Albert Austin.  \"Oh, no; we went home shortly upon bidding you good-by after our brief acquaintance in Minersville,\" he replied; adding, \"And I presume you had very nearly forgotten us?\"  \"No,\" she said; \"we have spoken of you occasionally,--papa, Max, and I,--and I recognized your father the moment I saw him to-day; you also, though I am not sure that I should have done so had you been alone; for of course you have changed much more than he has.\"  \"Not more than you have, Miss Raymond,\" he returned with a look of undisguised admiration; \"yet I knew you instantly, though I saw you before I perceived that the captain made one of the company you were in.\"  \"Indeed!\" she said with a merry little laugh. \"I am afraid I hoped I had grown and improved more than that would seem to imply.\"  \"But you are still as proud as ever of being an American, and as proud of your Stripes and Stars?\" he remarked enquiringly and with an amused smile.  \"Yes, most emphatically, yes,\" she replied, lifting her eyes to the flag floating overhead, \"I still think it the most beautiful banner ever flung to the breeze.\"  \"And I suppose--from its constant display here, there, and everywhere--that that must be the idea of Americans in general,\" remarked Miss Austin in a slightly sneering tone. \"I must say I have--naturally, I suppose,--a far greater admiration for England's flag, yet I should not want to see it so ostentatiously displayed on all occasions as yours is.\"  Lucilla colored, but was silent, fearing she might speak too warmly in defence of her favorite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],["title","The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#0)"],["body","Legends of the Jews  by Louis Ginzberg   TRANSLATED PROM THE GERMAN MANUSCRIPT BY HENRIETTA SZOLD   VOLUME I BIBLE TIMES AND CHARACTERS FROM THE CREATION TO JACOB     To MY BROTHER ASHER     Contents   PREFACE   I.

PREFACE   Was sich nie und nirgends hat begeben, das allein veraltet nie.  The term Rabbinic was applied to the Jewish Literature of post-Biblical times by those who conceived the Judaism of the later epoch to be something different from the Judaism of the Bible, something actually opposed to it. Such observers held that the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the product of the schools rather than the product of practical, pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings of morbid visionaries, is the material out of which these scholars construct the theologic system of the Rabbis, and fairy tales, the spontaneous creations of the people, which take the form of sacred legend in Jewish literature, are denominated the Scriptural exegesis of the Rabbis, and condemned incontinently as nugae rabbinorum.  As the name of a man clings to him, so men cling to names. For the primitive savage the name is part of the essence of a person or thing, and even in the more advanced stages of culture, judgments are not always formed in agreement with facts as they are, but rather according to the names by which they are called. The current estimate of Rabbinic Literature is a case in point. With the label Rabbinic later ages inherited from former ages a certain distorted view of the literature so designated. To this day, and even among scholars that approach its investigation with unprejudiced minds, the opinion prevails that it is purely a learned product. And yet the truth is that the most prominent feature of Rabbinic Literature is its popular character.  The school and the home are not mutually opposed to each other in the conception of the Jews. They study in their homes, and they live in their schools. Likewise there is no distinct class of scholars among them, a class that withdraws itself from participation in the affairs of practical life. Even in the domain of the Halakah, the Rabbis were not so much occupied with theoretic principles of law as with the concrete phenomena of daily existence. These they sought to grasp and shape. And what is true of the Halakah is true with greater emphasis of the Haggadah, which is popular in the double sense of appealing to the people and being produced in the main by the people. To speak of the Haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim is as far from fact as to speak of the legends of Shakespeare and Scott. The ancient authors and their modern brethren of the guild alike elaborate legendary material which they found at hand.  It has been held by some that the Haggadah contains no popular legends, that it is wholly a factitious, academic product. A cursory glance at the pseudepigraphic literature of the Jews, which is older than the Haggadah literature by several centuries, shows how untenable this view is. That the one literature should have drawn from the other is precluded by historical facts. At a very early time the Synagogue disavowed the pseudepigraphic literature, which was the favorite reading matter of the sectaries and the Christians. Nevertheless the inner relation between them is of the closest kind. The only essential difference is that the Midrashic form prevails in the Haggadah, and the parenetic or apocalyptic form in the pseudepigrapha. The common element must therefore depart from the Midrash on the one hand and from parenesis on the other.  Folklore, fairy tales, legends, and all forms of story telling akin to these are comprehended, in the terminology of the post-Biblical literature of the Jews, under the inclusive description Haggadah, a name that can be explained by a circumlocution, but cannot be translated. Whatever it is applied to is thereby characterized first as being derived from the Holy Scriptures, and then as being of the nature of a story. And, in point of fact, this dualism sums up the distinguishing features of Jewish Legend. More than eighteen centuries ago the Jewish historian Josephus observed that \"though we be deprived of our wealth, of our cities, or of the other advantages we have, our law continues immortal.\" The word he meant to use was not law, but Torah, only he could not find an equivalent for it in Greek. A singer of the Synagogue a thousand years after Josephus, who expressed his sentiments in Hebrew, uttered the same thought: \"The Holy City and all her daughter cities are violated, they lie in ruins, despoiled of their ornaments, their splendor darkened from sight. Naught is left to us save one eternal treasure alone—the Holy Torah.\" The sadder the life of the Jewish people, the more it felt the need of taking refuge in its past. The Scripture, or, to use the Jewish term, the Torah, was the only remnant of its former national independence, and the Torah was the magic means of making a sordid actuality recede before a glorious memory. To the Scripture was assigned the task of supplying nourishment to the mind as well as the soul, to the intellect as well as the imagination, and the result is the Halakah and the Haggadah.  The fancy of the people did not die out in the post-Biblical time, but the bent of its activity was determined by the past.  Men craved entertainment in later times as well as in the earlier, only instead of resorting for its subject-matter to what happened under their eyes, they drew from the fountain-head of the past. The events in the ancient history of Israel, which was not only studied, but lived over again daily, stimulated the desire to criticize it. The religious reflections upon nature laid down in the myths of the people, the fairy tales, which have the sole object of pleasing, and the legends, which are the people's verdict upon history—all these were welded into one product. The fancy of the Jewish people was engaged by the past reflected in the Bible, and all its creations wear a Biblical hue for this reason. This explains the peculiar form of the Haggadah.  But what is spontaneously brought forth by the people is often preserved only in the form impressed upon it by the feeling and the thought of the poet, or by the speculations of the learned. Also Jewish legends have rarely been transmitted in their original shape. They have been perpetuated in the form of Midrash, that is, Scriptural exegesis. The teachers of the Haggadah, called Rabbanan d'Aggadta in the Talmud, were no folklorists, from whom a faithful reproduction of legendary material may be expected. Primarily they were homilists, who used legends for didactic purposes, and their main object was to establish a close connection between the Scripture and the creations of the popular fancy, to give the latter a firm basis and secure a long term of life for them.  One of the most important tasks of the modern investigation of the Haggadah is to make a clean separation between the original elements"]]]
