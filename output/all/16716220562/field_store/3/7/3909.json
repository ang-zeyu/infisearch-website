At last when he was told that he must die by slow torture he begged for protection. His agony was awful. He pleaded and writhed in bodily and mental pain. Scarcely had the train reached Paris than this torture commenced. His clothes were torn off piecemeal and scattered in the crowd, people catching the shreds and putting them away as mementos. The child's father, her brother, and two uncles then gathered about the Negro as he lay fastened to the torture platform and thrust hot irons into his quivering flesh. It was horrible--the man dying by slow torture in the midst of smoke from his own burning flesh. Every groan from the fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd of 10,000 persons. The mass of beings 600 yards in diameter, the scaffold being the center. After burning the feet and legs, the hot irons--plenty of fresh ones being at hand--were rolled up and down Smith's stomach, back, and arms. Then the eyes were burned out and irons were thrust down his throat.  The men of the Vance family having wreaked vengeance, the crowd piled all kinds of combustible stuff around the scaffold, poured oil on it and set it afire. The Negro rolled and tossed out of the mass, only to be pushed back by the people nearest him. He tossed out again, and was roped and pulled back. Hundreds of people turned away, but the vast crowd still looked calmly on. People were here from every part of this section. They came from Dallas, Fort Worth, Sherman, Denison, Bonham, Texarkana, Fort Smith, Ark., and a party of fifteen came from Hempstead county, Arkansas, where he was captured. Every train that came in was loaded to its utmost capacity, and there were demands at many points for special trains to bring the people here to see the unparalleled punishment for an unparalleled crime. When the news of the burning went over the country like wildfire, at every country town anvils boomed forth the announcement.   SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ASYLUM  It may not be amiss in connection with this awful affair, in proof of our assertion that Smith was an imbecile, to give the testimony of a well-known colored minister, who lived at Paris, Texas, at the time of the lynching. He was a witness of the awful scenes there enacted, and attempted, in the name of God and humanity, to interfere in the programme. He barely escaped with his life, was driven out of the city and became an exile because of his actions. Reverend King was in New York about the middle of February, and he was there interviewed for a daily paper for that city, and we quote his account as an eye witness of the affair. Said he:    I was ridden out of Paris on a rail because I was the only man in Lamar   county to raise my voice against the lynching of Smith. I opposed the   illegal measures before the arrival of Henry Smith as a prisoner, and I   was warned that I might meet his fate if I was not careful; but the   sense of justice made me bold, and when I saw the poor wretch trembling   with fear, and got so near him that I could hear his teeth chatter, I   determined to stand by him to the last.    I hated him for his crime, but two crimes do not make a virtue; and in   the brief conversation I had with Smith I was more firmly convinced than   ever that he was irresponsible.    I had known Smith for years, and there were times when Smith was out of   his head for weeks. Two years ago I made an effort to have him put in an   asylum, but the white people were trying to fasten the murder of a young   colored girl upon him, and would not listen. For days before the murder   of the little Vance girl, Smith was out of his head and dangerous. He   had just undergone an attack of delirium tremens and was in no condition   to be allowed at large. He realized his condition, for I spoke with him   not three weeks ago, and in answer to my exhortations, he promised to   reform. The next time I saw him was on the day of his execution.    \"Drink did it! drink did it,\" he sobbed. Then bowing his face in his   hands, he asked: \"Is it true, did I kill her? Oh, my God, my God!\" For a   moment he seemed to forget the awful fate that awaited him, and his body   swayed to and fro with grief. Some one seized me by the shoulder and   hurled me back, and Smith fell writhing to the ground in terror as four   men seized his arms to drag him to the float on which he was to be   exhibited before he was finally burned at the stake.    I followed the procession and wept aloud as I saw little children of my   own race follow the unfortunate man and taunt him with jeers. Even at   the stake, children of both sexes and colors gathered in groups, and   when the father of the murdered child raised the hissing iron with which   he was about to torture the helpless victim, the children became as   frantic as the grown people and struggled forward to obtain places of   advantage.    It was terrible. One little tot scarcely older than little Myrtle Vance   clapped her baby hands as her father held her on his shoulders above the   heads of the people.    \"For God's sake,\" I shouted, \"send the children home.\"    \"No, no,\" shouted a hundred maddened voices; \"let them learn a lesson.\"    I love children, but as I looked about the little faces distorted with   passion and the bloodshot eyes of the cruel parents who held them high   in their arms, I thanked God that I have none of my own.    As the hot iron sank deep into poor Henry's flesh a hideous yell rent   the air, and, with a sound as terrible as the cry, of lost souls on   judgment day, 20,000 maddened people took up the victim's cry of agony   and a prolonged howl of maddened glee rent the air.    No one was himself now. Every man, woman and child in that awful crowd   was worked up to a greater frenzy than that which actuated Smith's   horrible crime. The people were capable of any new atrocity now, and as   Smith's yells became more and more frequent, it was difficult to hold   the crowd back, so anxious were the savages to participate in the   sickening tortures.    For half an hour I tried to pray as the beads of agony rolled down my   forehead and bathed my face.    For an instant a hush spread over the people. I could stand no more, and   with a superhuman effort dashed through the compact mass of humanity and   stood at the foot of the burning scaffold.    \"In the name of God,\" I cried, \"I command you to cease this torture.\"    The heavy butt of a Winchester rifle descended on my head and I fell to   the ground. Rough hands seized me and angry men bore me away, and I was   thankful.    At the outskirts of the crowd I was attacked again, and then several   men, no doubt glad to get away from the fearful place, escorted me to my   home, where I was allowed to take a small amount of clothing. A jeering   crowd gathered without, and when I appeared at the door ready hands   seized me and I was placed upon a rail, and, with curses and oaths,   taken to the railway station and placed upon a train. As the train moved   out some one thrust a roll of bills into my hand and said, \"God bless   you, but it was no use.\"  When asked if he should ever return to Paris, Mr. King said: \"I shall never go south again. The impressions of that awful day will stay with me forever.\"   LYNCHING OF INNOCENT MEN  (Lynched on Account of Relationship)  If no other reason appealed to the sober sense of the American people to check the growth of Lynch Law, the absolute unreliability and recklessness of the mob in inflicting punishment for crimes done, should do so. Several instances of this spirit have occurred in the year past. In Louisiana, near New Orleans, in July, 1893, Roselius Julian, a colored man, shot and killed a white judge, named Victor Estopinal. The cause of the shooting has never been definitely ascertained. It is claimed that the Negro resented an insult to his wife, and the killing of the white man was an act of a Negro (who dared) to defend his home. The judge was killed in the court house, and Julian, heavily armed, made his escape to the swamps near the city. He has never been apprehended, nor has any information ever been gleaned as to his whereabouts. A mob determined to secure the fugitive murderer and burn him alive. The swamps were hunted through and through in vain, when, being unable to wreak their revenge upon the murderer, the mob turned its attention to his unfortunate relatives. Dispatches from New Orleans, dated September 19, 1893, described the affair as follows:    Posses were immediately organized and the surrounding country was   scoured, but the search was fruitless so far as the real criminal was   concerned. The mother, three brothers and two sisters of the Negro were   arrested yesterday at the Black Ridge in the rear of the city by the   police and taken to the little jail on Judge Estopinal's place about   Southport, because of the belief that they were succoring the fugitive.    About 11 o'clock twenty-five men, some armed with rifles and shotguns,   came up to the jail. They unlocked the door and held a conference among   themselves as to what they should do. Some were in favor of hanging the   five, while others insisted that only two of the brothers should be   strung up. This was finally agreed to, and the two doomed negroes were   hurried to a pasture one hundred yards distant, and there asked to take   their last chance of saving their lives by making a confession, but the   Negroes made no reply. They were then told to kneel down and pray. One   did so, the other remained standing, but both prayed fervently. The   taller Negro was then hoisted up. The shorter Negro stood gazing at the   horrible death of his brother without flinching. Five minutes later he   was also hanged. The mob decided to take the remaining brother out to   Camp Parapet and hang him there. The other two were to be taken out and   flogged, with an order to get out of the parish in less than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],["title","The Red Record (#6)"],["body","an   hour. The third brother, Paul, was taken out to the camp, which is about   a mile distant in the interior, and there he was hanged to a tree.  Another young man, who was in no way related to Julian, who perhaps did not even know the man and who was entirely innocent of any offense in connection therewith, was murdered by the same mob. The same paper says:    During the search for Julian on Saturday one branch of the posse visited   the house of a Negro family in the neighborhood of Camp Parapet, and   failing to find the object of their search, tried to induce John Willis,   a young Negro, to disclose the whereabouts of Julian. He refused to do   so, or could not do so, and was kicked to death by the gang.   AN INDIANA CASE  Almost equal to the ferocity of the mob which killed the three brothers, Julian and the unoffending, John Willis, because of the murder of Judge Estopinal, was the action of a mob near Vincennes, Ind. In this case a wealthy colored man, named Allen Butler, who was well known in the community, and enjoyed the confidence and respect of the entire country, was made the victim of a mob and hung because his son had become unduly intimate with a white girl who was a servant around his house. There was no pretense that the facts were otherwise than as here stated. The woman lived at Butler's house as a servant, and she and Butler's son fell in love with each other, and later it was found that the girl was in a delicate condition. It was claimed, but with how much truth no one has ever been able to tell, that the father had procured an abortion, or himself had operated on the girl, and that she had left the house to go back to her home. It was never claimed that the father was in any way responsible for the action of his son, but the authorities procured the arrest of both father and son, and at the preliminary examination the father gave bail to appear before the Grand Jury when it should convene. On the same night, however, the mob took the matter in hand and with the intention of hanging the son. It assembled near Sumner, while the boy, who had been unable to give bail, was lodged in jail at Lawrenceville. As it was impossible to reach Lawrenceville and hang the son, the leaders of the mob concluded they would go to Butler's house and hang him. Butler was found at his home, taken out by the mob and hung to a tree. This was in the lawabiding state of Indiana, which furnished the United States its last president and which claims all the honor, pride and glory of northern civilization. None of the leaders of the mob were apprehended, and no steps whatever were taken to bring the murderers to justice.   KILLED FOR HIS STEPFATHER'S CRIME  An account has been given of the cremation of Henry Smith, at Paris, Texas, for the murder of the infant child of a man named Vance. It would appear that human ferocity was not sated when it vented itself upon a human being by burning his eyes out, by thrusting a red-hot iron down his throat, and then by burning his body to ashes. Henry Smith, the victim of these savage orgies, was beyond all the power of torture, but a few miles outside of Paris, some members of the community concluded that it would be proper to kill a stepson named William Butler as a partial penalty for the original crime. This young man, against whom no word has ever been said, and who was in fact an orderly, peaceable boy, had been watched with the severest scrutiny by members of the mob who believed he knew something of the whereabouts of Smith. He declared from the very first that he did not know where his stepfather was, which statement was well proven to be a fact after the discovery of Smith in Arkansas, whence he had fled through swamps and woods and unfrequented places. Yet Butler was apprehended, placed under arrest, and on the night of February 6, taken out on Hickory Creek, five miles southeast of Paris, and hung for his stepfather's crime. After his body was suspended in the air, the mob filled it with bullets.   LYNCHED BECAUSE THE JURY ACQUITTED HIM  The entire system of the judiciary of this country is in the hands of white people. To this add the fact of the inherent prejudice against colored people, and it will be clearly seen that a white jury is certain to find a Negro prisoner guilty if there is the least evidence to warrant such a finding.  Meredith Lewis was arrested in Roseland, La., in July of last year. A white jury found him not guilty of the crime of murder wherewith he stood charged. This did not suit the mob. A few nights after the verdict was rendered, and he declared to be innocent, a mob gathered in his vicinity and went to his house. He was called, and suspecting nothing, went outside. He was seized and hurried off to a convenient spot and hanged by the neck until he was dead for the murder of a woman of which the jury had said he was innocent.   LYNCHED AS A SCAPEGOAT  Wednesday, July 5, about 10 o'clock in the morning, a terrible crime was committed within four miles of Wickliffe, Ky. Two girls, Mary and Ruby Ray, were found murdered a short distance from their home. The news of this terrible cowardly murder of two helpless young girls spread like wild fire, and searching parties scoured the territory surrounding Wickliffe and Bardwell. Two of the searching party, the Clark brothers, saw a man enter the Dupoyster cornfield; they got their guns and fired at the fleeing figure, but without effect; he got away, but they said he was a white man or nearly so. The search continued all day without effect, save the arrest of two or three strange Negroes. A bloodhound was brought from the penitentiary and put on the trail which he followed from the scene of the murder to the river and into the boat of a fisherman named Gordon. Gordon stated that he had ferried one man and only one across the river about about half past six the evening of July 5; that his passenger sat in front of him, and he was a white man or a very bright mulatto, who could not be told from a white man. The bloodhound was put across the river in the boat, and he struck a trail again at Bird's Point on the Missouri side, ran about three hundred yards to the cottage of a white farmer named Grant and there lay down refusing to go further.  Thursday morning a brakesman on a freight train going out of Sikeston, Mo., discovered a Negro stealing a ride; he ordered him off and had hot words which terminated in a fight. The brakesman had the Negro arrested. When arrested, between 11 and 12 o'clock, he had on a dark woolen shirt, light pants and coat, and no vest. He had twelve dollars in paper, two silver dollars and ninety-five cents in change; he had also four rings in his pockets, a knife and a razor which were rusted and stained. The Sikeston authorities immediately jumped to the conclusion that this man was the murderer for whom the Kentuckians across the river were searching. They telegraphed to Bardwell that their prisoner had on no coat, but wore a blue vest and pants which would perhaps correspond with the coat found at the scene of the murder, and that the names of the murdered girls were in the rings found in his possession.  As soon as this news was received, the sheriffs of Ballard and Carlisle counties and a posse(?) of thirty well-armed and determined Kentuckians, who had pledged their word the prisoner should be taken back to the scene of the supposed crime, to be executed there if proved to be the guilty man, chartered a train and at nine o'clock Thursday night started for Sikeston. Arriving there two hours later, the sheriff at Sikeston, who had no warrant for the prisoner's arrest and detention, delivered him into the hands of the mob without authority for so doing, and accompanied them to Bird's Point. The prisoner gave his name as Miller, his home at Springfield, and said he had never been in Kentucky in his life, but the sheriff turned him over to the mob to be taken to Wickliffe, that Frank Gordon, the fisherman, who had put a man across the river might identify him.  In other words, the protection of the law was withdrawn from C.J. Miller, and he was given to a mob by this sheriff at Sikeston, who knew that the prisoner's life depended on one man's word. After an altercation with the train men, who wanted another $50 for taking the train back to Bird's Point, the crowd arrived there at three o'clock, Friday morning. Here was anchored _The Three States_, a ferryboat plying between Wickliffe, Ky, Cairo, Ill., and Bird's Point, Mo. This boat left Cairo at twelve o'clock, Thursday, with nearly three hundred of Cairo's best(?) citizens and thirty kegs of beer on board. This was consumed while the crowd and the bloodhound waited for the prisoner.  When the prisoner was on board _The Three States_ the dog was turned loose, and after moving aimlessly around, followed the crowd to where Miller sat handcuffed and there stopped. The crowd closed in on the pair and insisted that the brute had identified him because of that action. When the boat reached Wickliffe, Gordon, the fisherman, was called on to say whether the prisoner was the man he ferried over the river the day of the murder.  [Illustration: Lynching of C.J. Miller, at Bardwell, Kentucky, July 7, 1893.]  The sheriff of Ballard County informed him, sternly that if the prisoner was not the man, he (the fisherman) would be held responsible as knowing who the guilty man was. Gordon stated before, that the man he ferried across was a white man or a bright colored man; Miller was a dark brown skinned man, with kinky hair, \"neither yellow nor black,\" says the _Cairo Evening Telegram_ of Friday, July 7. The fisherman went up to Miller from behind, looked at him without speaking for fully five minutes, then slowly said, \"Yes, that's the man I crossed over.\" This was about six o'clock, Friday morning, and the crowd wished to hang Miller then and there. But Mr. Ray, the father of the girls, insisted that he be taken to Bardwell, the"]]]
