DEFINITIONS.--1. Lan'guid-ly, feebly. 5. Am'ply, fully. O-pin'ion, judgment, belief. 9. Ab'so-lute-ly, wholly, entirely. 11. Re-sent', to consider as an injury. Con'scious-ness, inward feeling, knowledge of what passes in one's own mind.   EXERCISES.--Why did Fred offer to wash the dishes? Was it a disgraceful thing to do? How was he rewarded? How did his schoolmates show their lack of manliness?    XV. TRUE MANLINESS. (52) (Concluded.)  1. \"Fire! fire!\" The cry crept out on the still night air, and the fire bells began to ring. Fred was wakened by the alarm and the red light streaming into his room. He dressed himself in a moment, almost, and tapped at the door of his mother's bedroom.  2. \"It is Mr. Barton's house, mother. Do let me go,\" he said in eager, excited tones. Mrs. Liscom thought a moment. He was young, but she could trust him, and she knew how much his heart was in the request.  3. \"Yes, you may go,\" she answered; \"but be careful, my boy. If you can help, do so; but do nothing rashly.\" Fred promised to follow her advice, and hurried to the fire.  4. Mr. and Mrs. Barton were not at home. The house had been left in charge of the servants. The fire spread with fearful speed, for there was a high wind, and it was found impossible to save the house. The servants ran about, screaming and lamenting, but doing nothing to any purpose.  5. Fred found Tom outside, in safety. \"Where is Katy?\" he asked. Tom, trembling with terror, seemed to have had no thought but of his own escape. He said, \"Katy is in the house!\" \"In what room?\" asked Fred. \"In that one,\" pointing to a window in the upper story.  6. It was no time for words, but for instant, vigorous action. The staircase was already on fire; there was but one way to reach Katy, and that full of danger. The second floor might fall at any moment, and Fred knew it. But he trusted in an arm stronger than his own, and silently sought help and guidance.  7. A ladder was quickly brought, and placed against the house. Fred mounted it, followed by the hired man, dashed in the sash of the window, and pushed his way into the room where the poor child lay nearly suffocated with smoke.  8. He roused her with some difficulty, carried her to the window, and placed her upon the sill. She was instantly grasped by strong arms, and carried down the ladder, Fred following as fast as possible. They had scarcely reached the ground before a crash of falling timbers told them that they had barely escaped with their lives.  9. Tom Barton never forgot the lesson of that night; and he came to believe, and to act upon the belief, in after years, that true manliness is in harmony with gentleness, kindness, and self-denial.   EXERCISES.--Relate the story of the fire. What is meant by \"to any purpose,\" in paragraph four? Did Fred show any lack of manliness when tested? What does this lesson teach?    XVI. THE BROWN THRUSH. (54)  Lucy Larcom, the author of the following poem, was born in 1826, and passed many years of her life as a factory girl at Lowell, Mass. She died in 1893.  1. There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;      \"He's singing to me! he's singing to me!\"    And what does he say, little girl, little boy?      \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!        Don't You hear? Don't you see?          Hush! look! In my tree    I'm as happy as happy can be!\"  2. And the brown thrush keeps singing, \"A nest do you see,      And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?    Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,      Or the world will lose some of its joy!        Now I'm glad! now I'm free!          And I always shall be,    If you never bring sorrow to me.\"  3. So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,      To you and to me, to you and to me;    And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,      \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!        But long it won't be,          Don't you know? Don't you see?    Unless we're as good as can be.\"  EXERCISES.--What is a thrush? Why was the thrush so happy? Do you think he would have been happy if the little boy or girl had robbed the nest?    XVII. A SHIP IN A STORM. (55)  1. Did you ever go far out upon the great ocean?  How beautiful it is to be out at sea, when the sea is smooth and still!  2. Let a storm approach, and the scene is changed. The heavy, black clouds appear in the distance, and throw a deep, deathlike shade over the world of waters.  3. The captain and sailors soon see in the clouds the signs of evil. All hands are then set to work to take in sail.  4. The hoarse notes of the captain, speaking through his trumpet, are echoed from lip to lip among the rigging. Happy will it be, if all is made snug before the gale strikes the vessel.  5. At last, the gale comes like a vast moving mountain of air. It strikes the ship. The vessel heaves and groans under the dreadful weight, and struggles to escape through the foaming waters.  6. If she is far out at sea, she will be likely to ride out the storm in safety. But if the wind is driving her upon the shore, the poor sailors will hardly escape being dashed upon the rocks, and drowned.  7. Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her masts were already broken, and her sails lost. While the wind was raging, and the billows were dashing against her, the cry was heard, \"A man has fallen overboard!\"  8. Quickly was the boat lowered, and she was soon seen bounding on her way over the mountain waves. At one moment, the boat seemed lifted to the skies, and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost beneath the waves!  9. At length, the man was found. He was well nigh drowned; but he was taken on board, and now they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so dreadfully, that it seemed certain death to go near her. And now, what should they do?  10. The captain told one of the men to go aloft and throw down a rope. This was made fast to the boat, and when the sea was somewhat calm it was hoisted, and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash. It was a desperate way of getting on board; but fortunately no lives were lost.  11. On the dangerous points along our seacoast are lighthouses, which can be seen far out at sea, and serve as guides to ships. Sometimes the fog is so dense that these lights can not be seen, but most lighthouses have great fog bells or fog horns; some of the latter are made to sound by steam, and can be heard for a long distance. These bells and horns are kept sounding as long as the fog lasts.  12. There are also many life-saving stations along the coast where trained men are ready with lifeboats. \"When a ship is driven ashore they at once go to the rescue of those on board, and thus many valuable lives are saved.  13. Take it all in all, a sailor's life is a very hard one. Our young friends owe a debt of gratitude to those whose home is upon the great waters, and who bring them the luxuries of other countries.   DEFINITIONS.--4. Ech'oed, sounded again. Gale, a wind storm. 5. Heaves, pitches up and down. 7. Bil'lows, waves. 10. Des'-per-ate, hopeless. 11. Fog, watery vapor, mist. 13. Grat'i-tude, thankfulness. Lux'u-ries, nice things.   EXERCISES.--What is this lesson about? When is it dangerous to be at sea? What do sailors then do? In what situation are they most likely to be saved? Relate the story of the man overboard. Tell about the lighthouses. How are vessels warned of danger in a fog? What about the life-saving stations? What is said of a sailor's life?    XVIII. THE SAILOR'S CONSOLATION. (58)  Charles Dibdin, the author, was born at Southampton, England, in 1745. He wrote a number of fine sea songs. He died in 1814.  1. One night came on a hurricane,    The sea was mountains rolling,    When Barney Buntline turned his quid,    And said to Billy Bowling:    \"A strong norwester's blowing, Bill;    Hark! don't ye hear it roar now?    Lord help 'em, how I pities all    Unhappy folks on shore now!  2. \"Foolhardy chaps who live in town,    What danger they are all in,    And now are quaking in their beds,    For fear the roof shall fall in;    Poor creatures, how they envy us,    And wish, as I've a notion,    For our good luck, in such a storm,    To be upon the ocean.  3. \"But as for them who're out all day,    On business from their houses,    And late at night are coming home,    To cheer the babes and spouses;    While you and I, Bill, on the deck,    Are comfortably lying,    My eyes! what tiles and chimney pots    About their heads are flying!  4. \"And very often have we heard    How men are killed and undone    By overturns of carriages,    By thieves, and fires in London.    We know what risks all landsmen run,    From noblemen to tailors;    Then, Bill, let us thank Providence    That you and I are sailors.\"   DEFINITIONS.-l. Hur'ri-cane, a violent windstorm. Quid, a small piece of tobacco. 2. Fool'har'dy, reckless. Quak'ing, shak-ing with fear. No'tion, idea. 3. Spous'es, wives. Tiles, thin pieces of baked clay used in roofing houses. Chim'ney pots, earthenware tops of chimneys. 4. Un-done', injured, ruined.   NOTES.--l. \"Barney Buntline\" and \"Billy Bowling\" are supposed to be two sailors. \"Norwester\" is a sailor's name for a northwest storm. 4. \"Landsmen\" is a term applied by sailors to all who live on shore.    XIX. TWO WAYS OF TELLING A STORY. (60) By HENRY K. OLIVER.  1. In one of the most populous cities of New England, a few years ago, a party of lads, all members of the same school, got up a grand sleigh ride. The sleigh was a very large one, drawn by six gray horses.  2. On the following day, as the teacher entered the schoolroom, he found his pupils in high glee, as they chattered about the fun and frolic of their excursion. In answer to some inquiries, one of the lads gave him an account of their trip and its various incidents.  3. As he drew near the end of his story, he exclaimed: \"Oh, sir! there was one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],["title","McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#8)"],["body","I had almost forgotten. As we were coming home, we saw ahead of us a queer looking affair in the road. It proved to be a rusty old sleigh, fastened behind a covered wagon, proceeding at a very slow rate, and taking up the whole road.  4. \"Finding that the owner was not disposed to turn out, we determined upon a volley of snowballs and a good hurrah. They produced the right effect, for the crazy machine turned out into the deep snow, and the skinny old pony started on a full trot.  5. \"As we passed, some one gave the horse a good crack, which made him run faster than he ever did before, I'll warrant.  6. \"With that, an old fellow in the wagon, who was buried up under an old hat, bawled out, 'Why do you frighten my horse?'  'Why don't you turn out, then?' says the driver. So we gave him three rousing cheers more. His horse was frightened again, and ran up against a loaded wagon, and, I believe, almost capsized the old creature--and so we left him.\"  7. \"Well, boys,\" replied the teacher, \"take your seat\", and I will tell you a story, and all about a sleigh ride, too. Yesterday afternoon a very venerable old clergyman was on his way from Boston to Salem, to pass the rest of the winter at the house of his son. That he might be prepared for journeying in the following spring he took with him his wagon, and for the winter his sleigh, which he fastened behind the wagon.  8. \"His sight and hearing were somewhat blunted by age, and he was proceeding very slowly; for his horse was old and feeble, like his owner. He was suddenly disturbed by loud hurrahs from behind, and by a furious pelting of balls of snow and ice upon the top of his wagon.  9. \"In his alarm he dropped his reins, and his horse began to run away. In the midst of the old man's trouble, there rushed by him, with loud shouts, a large party of boys, in a sleigh drawn by six horses. 'Turn out! turn out, old fellow!' 'Give us the road!' 'What will you take for your pony?' 'What's the price of oats, old man?' were the various cries that met his cars.  10. \"'Pray, do not frighten my horse!' exclaimed the infirm driver. 'Turn out, then! turn out!' was the answer, which was followed by repeated cracks and blows from the long whip of the 'grand sleigh,' with showers of snowballs, and three tremendous hurrahs from the boys.  11. \"The terror of the old man and his horse was increased, and the latter ran away with him, to the great danger of his life. He contrived, however, to stop his horse just in season to prevent his being dashed against a loaded wagon. A short distance brought him to the house of his son. That son, boys, is your instructor, and that 'old fellow,' was your teacher's father!\"  12. When the boys perceived how rude and unkind their conduct appeared from another point of view, they were very much ashamed of their thoughtlessness, and most of them had the manliness to apologize to their teacher for what they had done.   DEFINITIONS.-l. Pop'u-lous, full of inhabitants. 2. Ex-cur'-sion, a pleasure trip. In'ci-dents, things that happen, events. 5. War'rant, to declare with assurance. 6. Cap-sized', upset. 7. Ven'er-a-ble, deserving of honor and respect. 8. Blunt'ed, dulled.   EXERCISES.--Repeat the boys' story of the sleigh ride. The teacher's story. Were the boys ill-natured or only thoughtless? Is thoughtlessness any excuse for rudeness or unkindness?    XX. FREAKS OF THE FROST. (63)  By Hannah Flagg Gould, who was born at Lancaster, Vermont, in 1789. She published several volumes of poems (one for children) and one collection of prose articles, entitled \"Gathered Leaves.\" She died in 1865.  1. The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,    And whispered, \"Now I shall be out of sight;    So through the valley and over the height      In silence I'll take my way;    I will not go on, like that blustering train,    The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,    Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,      But I'll be as busy as they.\"  2. Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;    He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed    In diamond beads; and over the breast      Of the quivering lake, he spread    A coat of mail, that it need not fear    The downward point of many a spear,    That he hung on its margin, far and near,      Where a rock could rear its head.  3. He went to the windows of those who slept,    And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;    Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,      By the light of the morn were seen    Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;    There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;    There were cities with temples and towers, and these      All pictured in silver sheen.  4. But he did one thing that was hardly fair;    He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there    That all had forgotten for him to prepare,      \"Now just to set them a-thinking,    I'll bite this basket of fruit,\" said he,    \"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three;    And the glass of water they've left for me      Shall 'tchick!' to tell them I'm drinking.\"   DEFINITIONS.--l. Blus'ter-ing, being noisy and loud. Bus'tle, stir. 2. Crest, the top. Quiv'er-ing, trembling, shaking. Mar'gin, edge, border. 3. Bev'ies, flocks. Pic'tured, painted. Sheen, brightness, splendor of appearance.   EXERCISES.--What did the frost say? What did he do to the mountain? The trees? The lake? What is a \"coat of mail\"? What did he do to the window? The pitcher?    XXI. WASTE NOT, WANT NOT. (64)  1. Mr. Jones. Boys, if you have nothing to do, will you unpack these parcels for me?  2. The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good whipcord. Ben took his parcel to the table, and began to examine the knot, and then to untie it.  3. John took the other parcel, and tried first at one corner, and then at the other, to pull off the string. But the cord had been too well secured, and he only drew the knots tighter.  4. John. I wish these people would not tie up their parcels so tightly, as if they were never to be undone. Why, Ben, how did you get yours undone? What is in your parcel? I wonder what is in mine! I wish I could get the string off. I will cut it.  5. Ben. Oh, no, do not cut it, John! Look, what a nice cord this is, and yours is the same. It is a pity to cut it.  6. John. Pooh! what signifies a bit of pack thread?  7. Ben. It is whipcord.  8. John. Well, whipcord then! what signifies a bit of whipcord? You can get a piece of whipcord twice as long as that for three cents; and who cares for three cents? Not I, for one. So, here it goes.  9. So he took out his knife, and cut it in several places.  10. Mr. Jones. Well, my boys, have you undone the parcels for me?  11. John. Yes, sir; here is the parcel.  12. Ben. And here is my parcel, father, and here is also the string.  13. Mr. Jones. You may keep the string, Ben.  14. Ben. Thank you, sir. What excellent whipcord it is!  15. Mr. Jones. And you, John, may keep your string, too, if it will be of any use to you.  16. John. It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir.  17.  Mr. Jones. No, I am afraid not, if this is it.  18. A few weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of his sons a new top.  19. John. How is this, Ben? These tops have no strings. What shall we do for strings?  20. Ben. I have a string that will do very well for mine. And he pulled it out of his pocket.  21. John. Why, if that is not the whipcord! I wish I had saved mine.  22. A few days afterward, there was a shooting match, with bows and arrows, among the lads. The prize was a fine bow and arrows, to be given to the best marksman. \"Come, come,\" said Master Sharp, \"I am within one inch of the mark. I should like to see who will go nearer.\"  23. John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow struck within a quarter of an inch of Master Sharp's. \"Shoot away,\" said Sharp; \"but you must understand the rules. We settled them before you came. You are to have three shots with your own arrows. Nobody is to borrow or lend. So shoot away.\"  24. John seized his second arrow; \"If I have any luck,\" said he;--but just as he pronounced the word \"luck,\" the string broke, and the arrow fell from his hands.  25.  Master Sharp. There! It is all over with you.  26.  Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.  27. Master Sharp. No, no, sir; that is not fair.  Did you not hear the rules? There is to be no lending.  28. It was now Ben's turn to make his trial. His first arrow missed the mark; the second was exactly as near as John's first. Before venturing the last arrow, Ben very prudently examined the string of his bow; and, as he pulled it to try its strength, it snapped.  29. Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for joy. But his dancing suddenly ceased, when careful Ben drew out of his pocket an excellent piece of cord, and began to tie it to the bow.  30. \"The everlasting whipcord, I declare!\" cried John. \"Yes,\" said Ben, \"I put it in my pocket today, because I thought I might want it.\"  31. Ben's last arrow won the prize; and when the bow and arrows were handed to him, John said, \"How valuable that whipcord has been to you, Ben. I'll take care how I waste anything hereafter.\"   DEFINITIONS,--2. Ex-am'ine, to look at carefully. 6. Sig'ni--fies, to be important. 22. Marks'man, one who shoots well. 28. Pru'dent-ly, with proper caution. 29. Ceased, stopped. 30. Ev--er-last'ing, lasting always.   EXERCISES.--What is this lesson designed to teach? Which of the boys preserved his whipcord? What good did it do him? What did the other boy do with his? What was the consequence? What did he learn from it?  XXII. JEANNETTE AND JO. (67)  By Mary Mapes Dodge, who was born in New York City in 1838. She is the editor of the \"St. Nicholas\" magazine, and has written many stories for children.  1. Two girls I know--Jeannette and Jo,    And one is always moping;    The other lassie, come what may,    Is ever bravely hoping.  2.
