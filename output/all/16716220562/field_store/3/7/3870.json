He is not here to see thee!  Joseph: \"Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.\"  Thereupon she took Joseph into her chamber, where an idol hung above the bed. This she covered, that it might not be a witness of what she was about to do. Joseph said: \"Though thou coverest up the eyes of the idol, remember, the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth. Yes,\" continued Joseph, \"I have many reasons not to do this thing for the sake of God. Adam was banished from Paradise on account of violating a light command; how much more should I have to fear the punishment of God, were I to commit so grave a sin as adultery! The Lord is in the habit of choosing a favorite member of our family as a sacrifice unto Himself. Perhaps He desireth to make choice of me, but if I do thy will, I make myself unfit to be a sacrifice unto God. Also the Lord is in the habit of appearing suddenly, in visions of the night, unto those that love Him. Thus did He appear unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I fear that He may appear unto me at the very moment while I am defiling myself with thee. And as I fear God, so I fear my father, who withdrew the birthright from his first-born son Reuben, on account of an immoral act, and gave it to me. Were I to fulfil thy desire, I would share the fate of my brother Reuben.\"[113]  With such words, Joseph endeavored to cure the wife of his master of the wanton passion she had conceived for him, while he took heed to keep far from a heinous sin, not from fear of the punishment that would follow, nor out of consideration for the opinion of men, but because he desired to sanctify the Name of God, blessed be He, before the whole world.[114] It was this feeling of his that Zuleika could not comprehend, and when, finally, carried away by passion, she told him in unmistakable language what she desired,[115] and he recoiled from her, she said to Joseph: \"Why dost thou refuse to fulfil my wish? Am I not a married woman? None will find out what thou hast done.\" Joseph replied: \"If the unmarried women of the heathen are prohibited unto us, how much more their married women?[116] As the Lord liveth, I will not commit the crime thou biddest me do.\" In this Joseph followed the example of many pious men, who utter an oath at the moment when they are in danger of succumbing to temptation, and seek thus to gather moral courage to control their evil instincts.\"  When Zuleika could not prevail upon him, to persuade him, her desire threw her into a grievous sickness, and all the women of Egypt came to visit her, and they said unto her, \"Why art thou so languid and wasted, thou that lackest nothing? Is not thy husband a prince great and esteemed in the sight of the king? Is it possible that thou canst want aught of what thy heart desireth?\" Zuleika answered them, saying, \"This day shall it be made known unto you whence cometh the state wherein you see me.\"  She commanded her maid-servants to prepare food for all the women, and she spread a banquet before them in her house. She placed knives upon the table to peel the oranges, and then ordered Joseph to appear, arrayed in costly garments, and wait upon her guests. When Joseph came in, the women could not take their eyes off him, and they all cut their hands with the knives, and the oranges in their hands were covered with blood, but they, not knowing what they were doing, continued to look upon the beauty of Joseph without turning their eyes away from him.  Then Zuleika said unto them: \"What have ye done? Behold, I set oranges before you to eat, and you have cut your hands.\" All the women looked at their hands, and, lo, they were full of blood, and it flowed down and stained their garments. They said to Zuleika, \"This slave in thy house did enchant us, and we could not turn our eyes away from him on account of his beauty.\" She then said: \"This happened to you that looked upon him but a moment, and you could not refrain yourselves! How, then, can I control myself in whose house he abideth continually, who see him go in and out day after day? How, then, should I not waste away, or keep from languishing on account of him!\" And the women spake, saying: \"It is true, who can look upon this beauty in the house, and refrain her feelings? But he is thy slave! Why dost thou not disclose to him that which is in thy heart, rather than suffer thy life to perish through this thing?\" Zuleika answered them: \"Daily do I endeavor to persuade him, but he will not consent to my wishes. I promised him everything that is fair, yet have I met with no return from him, and therefore I am sick, as you may see.\"  Her sickness increased upon her. Her husband and her household suspected not the cause of her decline, but all the women that were her friends knew that it was on account of the love she bore Joseph, and they advised her all the time to try to entice the youth. On a certain day, while Joseph was doing his master's work in the house, Zuleika came and fell suddenly upon him, but Joseph was stronger than she, and he pressed her down to the ground. Zuleika wept, and in a voice of supplication, and in bitterness of soul, she said to Joseph: \"Hast thou ever known, seen, or heard of a woman my peer in beauty, let alone a woman with beauty exceeding mine? Yet I try daily to persuade thee, I fall into decline through love of thee, I confer all this honor upon thee, and thou wilt not hearken unto my voice! Is it by reason of fear of thy master, that he punish thee? As the king liveth, no harm shall come upon thee from thy master on account of this thing. Now, therefore, I pray thee, listen to me, and consent unto my desire for the sake of the honor that I have conferred upon thee, and take this death away from me. For why should I die on account of thee?\" Joseph remained as steadfast under these importunities as before. Zuleika, however, was not discouraged; she continued her solicitations unremittingly, day after day,[118] month after month, for a whole year, but always without the least success, for Joseph in his chastity did not permit himself even to look upon her, wherefore she resorted to constraint. She had an iron shackle placed upon his chin, and he was compelled to keep his head up and look her in the face.\"[119]     JOSEPH RESISTS TEMPTATION   Seeing that she could not attain her object by entreaties or tears, Zuleika finally used force, when she judged that the favorable chance had come. She did not have long to wait. When the Nile overflowed its banks, and, according to the annual custom of the Egyptians, all repaired to the river, men and women, people and princes, accompanied by music, Zuleika remained at home under pretense of being sick. This was her long-looked-for opportunity, she thought. She rose up and ascended to the hall of state, and arrayed herself in princely garments. She placed precious stones upon her head, onyx stones set in silver and gold, she beautified her face and her body with all sorts of things for the purifying of women, she perfumed the hall and the whole house with cassia and frankincense, spread myrrh and aloes all over, and afterward sat herself down at the entrance to the hall, in the vestibule leading to the house, through which Joseph had to pass to his work.  And, behold, Joseph came from the field, and he was on the point of entering the house to do his master's work, but when he reached the place where Zuleika sat, and saw all she had done, he turned back. His mistress, perceiving it, called out to him, \"What aileth thee, Joseph? Go to thy work, I will make room for thee, that thou mayest pass by to thy seat.\" Joseph did as she bade him, he entered the house, took his seat, and set about his master's work as usual. Then Zuleika stood before him suddenly in all her beauty of person and magnificence of raiment, and repeated the desire of her heart.[120] It was the first and the last time that Joseph's steadfastness deserted him, but only for an instant. When he was on the point of complying with the wish of his mistress, the image of his mother Rachel appeared before him, and that of his aunt Leah, and the image of his father Jacob. The last addressed him thus: \"In time to come the names of thy brethren will be graven upon the breastplate of the high priest. Dost thou desire to have thy name appear with theirs? Or wilt thou forfeit this honor through sinful conduct? For know, he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance.\" This vision of the dead, and especially the image of his father, brought Joseph to his senses, and his illicit passion departed from him.[121]  Astonished at the swift change in his countenance, Zuleika said, \"My friend and true-love, why art thou so affrighted that thou art near to swooning?  Joseph: \"I see my father!\"  Zuleika: \"Where is he? Why, there is none in the house.\"  Joseph: \"Thou belongest to a people that is like unto the ass, it perceiveth nothing. But I belong to those who can see things.\"  Joseph fled forth, away from the house of his mistress,[122] the same house in which aforetime wonders had been done for Sarah kept a captive there by Pharaoh.[123] But hardly was he outside when the sinful passion again overwhelmed him, and he returned to Zuleika's chamber. Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah[124] in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\" Sobered again, Joseph started to escape from his mistress,[125] but Zuleika caught him by his garment, and she said: \"As the king liveth, if thou wilt not fulfil my wish, thou must die,\" and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14946"],["title","The Blossoming Rod (#0)"],["body","BLOSSOMING ROD  by  MARY STEWART CUTTING   A.L. Burt Company Publishers New York Doubleday, Page & Company        [Illustration: _He was out in the backyard ... flapping that rod in circles_]     Mr. Langshaw had vaguely felt unusual preparations for a Christmas gift to him this year; he was always being asked for \"change\" to pay the children for services rendered.  It might have seemed a pity that calculation as to dollars and cents entered so much into the Christmas festivities of the family, if it were not that it entered so largely into the scheme of living that it was naturally interwoven with every dearest hope and fancy; the overcoming of its limitations gave a zest to life. Langshaw himself, stopping now, as was his daily habit, to look at the display made by the sporting-goods shop on his way home the Friday afternoon before Christmas Monday, wondered, as his hand touched the ten-dollar bill in his pocket--a debt unexpectedly paid him that day--if the time had actually arrived at last when he might become the possessor of the trout-rod that stood in the corner of the window; reduced, as the ticket proclaimed, from fifteen dollars to ten.  The inspiration was the more welcome because the moment before his mind had been idly yet disquietingly filled with the shortcomings of George, his eldest child, and only son, aged ten, who didn't seem to show that sense of responsibility which his position and advanced years called for--even evading his duties to his fond mother when he should be constituting himself her protector. He was worried as to the way George would turn out when he grew up.  This particular trout-rod, however, had an attraction for Langshaw of long standing. He had examined it carefully more than once when in the shop with his neighbour, Wickersham; it wasn't a fifty-dollar rod, of course, but it seemed in some ways as good as if it were--it was expensive enough for him! He had spoken of it once to his wife, with a craving for her usual sympathy, only to meet with a surprise that seemed carelessly disapproving.  \"Why, you have that old one of your father's and the bass-rod already; I can't see why you should want another. You always say you can't get off to go fishing as it is.\"  He couldn't explain that to have this particular split bamboo would be almost as good as going on a fishing trip; with it in his hand he could feel himself between green meadows, the line swirling down the rushing brook. But later Clytie had gone back to the subject with pondering consideration.  \"Ten dollars seems an awful price for a rod! I'm sure I could buy the same thing for much less uptown; wouldn't you like me to see about it some day?\"  \"Great Scott! Never think of such a thing!\" he had replied in horror. \"I could get much cheaper ones myself! If I ever have the money I'll do the buying--you hear?\"  \"--Hello, Langshaw! Looking at that rod again? Why don't you blow yourself to a Christmas present? Haven't you got the nerve?\"  \"That's what I don't know!\" called Langshaw with a wave of the hand as Wickersham passed by. Yet, even as he spoke he felt he did know--his mind was joyously, adventurously made up to have \"the nerve\"; he had a right, for once in the twelve years of his married life, to buy himself a Christmas present that he really wanted, in distinction to the gift that family affection prompted, and held dear as such, but which had no relation to his needs or desires. Children and friends were provided for; his wife's winter suit--a present by her transforming imagination--already in the house; the Christmas turkey for the janitor of the children's school subscribed to--sometimes he had wished himself the janitor!--and all the small demands that drain the purse at the festal season carefully counted up and allowed for. There was no lien on this unexpected sum just received. The reel and the line, and the flies and such, would have to wait until another time, to be sure; but no one could realize what it would be to him to come home and find that blessed rod there. He had a wild impulse to go in and buy it that moment, but such haste seemed too slighting to the dignity of that occasion, which should allow the sweets of anticipation--though no one knew better than he the danger of delay where money was concerned: it melted like snow in the pocket. Extra funds always seemed to bring an extra demand.  The last time there was ten dollars to spare there had been a letter from Langshaw's mother, saying that his sister Ella, whose husband was unfortunately out of a position, had developed flat-foot; and a pair of suitable shoes, costing nine-fifty, had been prescribed by the physician. Was it possible for her dear boy to send the money? Ella was so depressed.  The ten dollars had, of course, gone to Ella. Both Langshaw and his wife had an unsympathetic feeling that if they developed flat-foot now they would have to go without appropriate shoes.  \"You look quite gay!\" said his wife as she greeted him on his return, her pretty oval face, with its large dark eyes and dark curly locks, held up to be kissed. \"Has anything nice happened?\"  \"You look gay, too!\" he evaded laughingly, as his arms lingered round her. Clytie was always a satisfactory person for a wife. \"What's this pink stuff on your hair--popcorn?\"  \"Oh, goodness! Baby has been so bad, she has been throwing it round everywhere,\" she answered, running ahead of him upstairs to a room that presented a scene of brilliant disorder.  On the bed was a large box of tinselled Christmas-tree decorations and another of pink-and-white popcorn--the flotsam and jetsam of which strewed the counterpane and the floor to its farthest corners, mingled with scraps of glittering paper, an acreage of which surrounded a table in the centre of the room that was adorned with mucilage pot and scissors. A large feathered hat, a blue silk dress, and a flowered skirt were on the rug, near which a very plump child of three, with straggling yellow hair, was trying to get a piece of gilt paper off her shoe. She looked up with roguish blue eyes to say rapidly:  \"Fardie doesn't know what baby goin' agive 'm for Kissemus!\"  \"Hello! This looks like the real thing,\" said Langshaw, stepping over the débris; \"but what are all these clothes on the floor for?\"  \"Oh, Mary was dressing up and just dropped those things when she went to the village with Viney, though I called her twice to come back and pick them up,\" said the mother, sweeping the garments out of the way. \"It's so tiresome of her! Oh, I know you stand up for everything Mary does, Joe Langshaw; but she is the hardest child to manage!\"  Her tone insensibly conveyed a pride in the difficulty of dealing with her elder daughter, aged six.  \"But did you ever see anything like Baby? She can keep a secret as well as any one! It does look Christmasy, though--doesn't it? Of course all the work of the tree at the mission comes on me as usual. The children, with the two Wickersham girls, were helping me until they got tired. Why don't you come and kiss father, Baby? She is going to sweep up the floor with her little broom so that father will give her five cents.\"  \"I don't want to fweep 'e floor!\" said the child, snapping her blue eyes.  \"She shall get her little broom and Fardie will help her,\" said Langshaw, catching the child up in his arms and holding the round little form closely to him before putting her down carefully on her stubby feet.  Later, when the game of clearing up was over and the nickel clutched in Baby's fat palm, he turned to his wife with a half-frown:  \"Don't you think you are making the children rather mercenary, Clytie? They seem to want to be paid for everything they do. I'm just about drained out of change!\"  \"Oh, at Christmas!\" said the wife expressively.  \"Well, I hope nobody is going to spend any money on me; the only presents I want are those you make for me,\" said Langshaw warningly. He gave the same warning each year, undeterred by the nature of the articles produced. His last year's \"Christmas\" from Clytie had been a pair of diaphanous blue China-silk pyjamas that were abnormally large in chest and sleeves--as for one of giant proportions--and correspondingly contracted in the legs, owing to her cutting out the tops first and having to get the other necessary adjuncts out of the scant remainder of the material. \"You hear me, Clytie?\"  \"Yes, I hear,\" returned Clytie in a bored tone.  \"Do you know--\" Langshaw hesitated, a boyish smile overspreading his countenance. \"I was looking at that trout-rod in Burchell's window to-day. I don't suppose you remember my speaking of it, but I've had my eye on it for a long time.\" He paused, expectant of encouraging interest.  \"Oh, have you, dear?\" said Clytie absently. The room was gradually, under her fingers, resuming its normal appearance. She turned suddenly with a vividly animated expression.  \"I must tell you that you're going to get a great surprise tonight--it isn't a Christmas present, but it's something that you'll like even better, I know. It's about something that George has been doing. You'll never guess what it is!\"  \"Is that so?\" said Langshaw absently in his turn. He had a momentary sense of being set back in his impulse to confidences that was not, after all, untinged with pleasure. His delightful secret was still his own, unmarred by unresponsive criticism. \"By the way, Clytie, I don't like the way George has been behaving lately. He hasn't shown me his report from school in months; whenever I ask him for it he has some excuse. Hello! Is that little Mary crying?\"  \"I wonder what on earth has happened now!\" exclaimed the mother, rushing from the room, to return the next instant, pulling after her a red-cloaked and red-hatted little girl who sought to hide behind her.  \"Well, what do you think she's done?\" Clytie's tone was withering as she haled forth the shrinking culprit, her small hands over her eyes. \"She lost her purse with the dollar she had saved "]]]
