Such questions as the following on the financial history of the United States are each answerable with a few words and will serve as an illustration of the method which may be employed in reviewing any other phase of history:--       1. By what means was trade accomplished before the use of money?       2. What are the functions of money?       3. What determines the amount of money needed in a country?       4.

What was the effect on prices?      24. What on wages?      25. Under what President was the independent treasury first         established?      26. Is it in existence to-day?      27. When were greenbacks issued?      28. To what amount?      29. Who was responsible for the issue?      30. Were they legal tender for private debts contracted before         their issue?      31. When was the Resumption Act passed?      32. Are the greenbacks in circulation to-day?      33. What is free silver?      34. What was the \"Crime of '73\"?      35. What was the \"Bland-Allison Act\"?      36. What was the Currency Act of 1900?      37. What is Bimetallism?      38. What is meant by \"Mint Ratio\"?      39. What is meant by \"Market Ratio\"?      40. What is meant by \"Free Coinage\"?      41. What is meant by \"Gratuitous Coinage\"?      42. What is meant by \"Standard Money\"?      43. With the market ratio at 30 to 1 and the mint ratio at 16 to 1,         which money would tend to disappear from circulation if both         metals are freely coined and made full legal tender?      44. Why is silver not the standard to-day?      45. What is the \"Aldrich Plan\"?      46. What is a United States bond?      47. Is it a secure investment?      48. What is its average rate of interest?      49. By whom is a national bank chartered?      50. May it issue paper money?      51. When was the first National Banking Act passed?      52. Why?      53.

May States emit bills of credit?      57. Is it constitutional for banks chartered by the State to emit         bills of credit?      58. Do they do so to-day?      59. Why?  Obviously as the year advances, the list of questions for review grows longer. An increasing amount of time should therefore be devoted to work of this sort.   _They will insure a better acquaintance with great men and women_  The most superficial observation will suffice to convince anyone that high school graduates know very little about the great men and women of history. The character sketches suggested earlier in the chapter, supplemented with occasional reviews, will do much to improve this condition. These drills may be conducted by asking for brief statements on the greatest service or the most distinguishing characteristic of the great men and women met with in the course. The same thing is accomplished by reversing the process and asking such questions as,--\"Who was the American Fabius\"? or \"The Great Compromiser\"? or the \"Sage of Menlo Park\"? etc. Questions on the authorship of great documents, the founders of institutions, the organizers of movements, reformers, philosophers, artists, statesmen, generals, accomplish the same purpose.   _They will be economical of time_  There are a vast number of review questions answerable with _yes_ or _no_. The student's knowledge of the subject may be quickly discovered and a rapid review conducted by a series of such questions. The following list on American history will illustrate the method:--       1. Was Cromwell's colonial policy helpful to the American colonies?       2. Did the Revolution of 1688 have any effect on the colonies?       3. Were the Huguenots excluded from Canada?       4. Were the Writs of Assistance used in England?       5. Did America ever have a theocracy?       6. Did the rule of 1756 affect the people of the colonies?       7. Was the Sugar Act legal?       8. Was there any effort to amend the Articles of Confederation?       9. Does funding a debt lessen it?      10. Did Hamilton's measures tend to centralize power?      11. Did the members of the Constitutional Convention exceed their         instructions?      12. Is a cabinet provided for in the Constitution?      13. Does the Constitution of the United States prevent a State from         establishing a religion?      14. Is it possible for a State to repudiate its debts?      15. Does the constitutional provision for uniform duties protect         the Territories?      16. Was impressment practiced in England?      17. Did the Whigs favor internal improvements?      18. Did the North favor the Force Bill of 1833?      19. Did Massachusetts favor the Tariff of 1816?      20. Did the Republican party stand for the abolition of slavery in         1860?      21. Did the Emancipation Proclamation free all the slaves in the         United States?      22. Did the working-men of England favor the South during the Civil         War?      23. Was it necessary for the South to resort to the draft?      24. Could a man in 1860 consistently accept both the Dred Scott         decision and the doctrine of popular sovereignty?      25. Did Lincoln's assassination have any effect on the         reconstruction policy?      26. Does the Federal Constitution compel negro suffrage?      27. Was the Anaconda System successful?      28. Was a President of the United States ever impeached?      29. Were the claims for indirect damages in the Alabama claims         allowed?      30. Did Calhoun favor the Compromise of 1850?      31. Did Thaddeus Stevens favor the Fifteenth Amendment to the         Constitution?      32. Did Lincoln favor the social equality of the white and black         races?      33. Did Grant favor the Tenure of Office Act?      34. Did Lee make more than one attempt to invade the North?      35. Was the \"Ohio Idea\" ever strong enough to affect legislation?      36. Did Spain have any part in calling out the Monroe Doctrine?      37. Has the United States any control over the debts of Cuba?      38. Has a joint resolution ever been used to acquire territory         other than that included in Texas?      39. Has the United States ever resorted to a tax on incomes?      40. Has the Federal Government ever attempted to restrict the power         of the press?      41. Is it illegal to-day for a railway to give a cheaper rate to         one shipper than to another?      42. Has the Republican party ever reduced the protective tariffs of         the war?      43. Did the Civil Service Act passed in 1883 include postmasters?      44. Did the Wilson-Gorman Act reduce the tariff to a revenue basis?      45. Can a railway engaged solely in intra-state business carry a         case, involving a reduction of their rates by the State         legislature, to the Supreme Court of the United States?      46. Is Utah a part of the Louisiana Purchase?      47. If the mint ratio is 16 to 1 and the market ratio is 17 to 1,         will the gold dollar be the standard if there is full legal         tender and free coinage for both gold and silver?      48. Is the Canadian frontier fortified?      49. Are the functions of government in this country increasing?      50. Is it possible for a man to be defeated for the Presidency if a         majority of the people vote for him?  The great disadvantage of this kind of review is that the students have for their answer a choice between two words, one of which is bound to be correct. Knowing nothing whatever of the subject, they will still stand a fifty per cent chance of answering correctly. The alert teacher should be able to reduce this haphazard answering to a minimum, while still reaping the advantages of rapidity and thoroughness which the plan possesses. Few other methods will cover as much ground in as short time. On the Federal Constitution there are infinite possibilities for \"yes and no\" questioning, which afford a brief and effective means of review in the principles of American government.   _They will secure fluency_  Review for the purpose of securing fluency is a consideration frequently lost sight of by high school history teachers. It may be too sanguine to expect fluency of the average student reciting on a topic for the first time. But when it is considered how very many important questions are never recited on but once, the wisdom of an occasional review to secure rapid, fluent, and complete answers to topics previously discussed is readily seen. Select a list of topics that will at one and the same time cultivate fluency and strengthen the memory for the important considerations of history. Fluency in itself does not possess sufficient"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],["title","The Teaching of History (#7)"],["body","to justify the expenditure of recitation time. Facility of expression needs to be cultivated in discussion of the conclusions reached in class which need to be clinched in the student's mind. Such questions as the following will serve as illustrations of the kind adaptable for such purpose, at the middle of a year course in American history:--       1. Give three distinct characteristics of French colonization in         America; three of Spanish; three of English.       2. What things did the English colonies possess in common?       3. What were the results to the colonies of the French and Indian         War?       4. To what extent was the Revolution brought about by economic         causes?       5. What were the defects in the Articles of Confederation?       6. Account for the downfall of the Federalist party.       7. In what ways has democracy advanced since 1789?       8. What were the results of the struggle over the admission of         Missouri?       9. Discuss the growth of the sentiment for internal improvements?      10. Describe the social life of the Western pioneer?   _What the student may do with \"problems\" in history_  Still another kind of review of great value in strengthening the student's ability to generalize and analyze, consists of what might be called \"problems in history.\" They are given out in much the same way as original problems in geometry, assuming that the student is acquainted with the facts from which to deduce the answers to the question. The object of such a review is to give the student practice in original thinking. He is not supposed to use a library, but only the facts which are in his text or which have been previously brought out in class recitations.  The following are examples of questions adaptable for this purpose:--       1. Why can the American people be regarded as the world's greatest         colonizers?       2. Why could Washington be regarded as only an Englishman living in         America?       3. Is it true that the South lost the Civil War because of slavery?       4. In what particulars did Andrew Jackson accurately reflect the         spirit or the ideals of the new West?       5. What is illustrated by the attempt to found the State of         Franklin?       6. What considerations made the secession of the West in our early         history a likely possibility?  Questions of this kind, not answered directly in class or in the text, may be given out a day in advance and the answers collected at the next recitation.     VI  THE USE OF WRITTEN REPORTS   _The purpose of theme work should change as the course continues_  A method frequently employed by teachers of history is to require written reports or themes on various phases of the history as the work progresses. This plan is particularly valuable for the students in the first two years of high school history, for the reason that their library requirements are less exacting and their need of fluency greater during that time than later in their course. The objects of theme work in history courses are usually to arouse the pupil's powers of observation, description, and narration, and to provide means of drill in the exercise of these powers. These should not be the sole purposes of theme work, however. As the year advances, an increasing amount of the written work should be on subjects requiring some generalization or analysis of the facts brought out in the text or in the recitation. The pupil who has written a theme describing the appearance of the Pyramids has completed an exercise in history less valuable than that of the student who writes a theme on the errors of the Athenian Democracy.  To summarize, reviews in history should consist of both oral and written work; they should be rapid enough to insure quick thinking, alert attention, and small expenditure of time; they should occur with increasing frequency as the year advances; they should stock the memory, fix in the student's mind the order of events, stimulate fluency, insure a permanent acquaintance with the personnel of history, and give to the student a better view of the subject as a whole and in its various phases.     VII  EXAMINATIONS AS TESTS OF PROGRESS   _The examination should determine how much the student has progressed_  The time is coming, if it is not already here, when the public will cry out against the nervous fear and sleepless nights with which their children approach the semi-annual torture of our inquisitorial examinations. That reasonable examinations are essential and beneficial is hardly open to question. That a student should be expected correctly to answer a fair percentage of reasonable questions on work which has been properly taught is not a cause of complaint from anyone. But that children should be frightened into a state of nervous terror by the bugaboo of an impending examination, and then be forced to attempt a series of conundrums propounded by a teacher who takes pride in maintaining a high percentage of failures, is indefensible. An examination should not be conducted with the primary object of making it a thing to be feared. However desirable such a questionable asset may seem to certain college professors, it is a serious fault in a high school teacher to have any considerable number of normal children fail. The ambition of the good instructor is to give an examination which shall at once be thorough, reasonable, and intelligently directed toward finding what the student has really learned. His purpose is to test accurately the various abilities which he has endeavored to encourage in the student during his course. He wishes to ascertain how much the student has really progressed.   _Specific suggestions on formulating questions_  In order to do this the examination must be on the really material considerations of the history. Questions on unimportant details should be omitted. The student should not be expected to burden his memory with the limitless mass of petty isolated facts contained in the average history text. The questions should be on considerations that have been carefully discussed, and not on facts that have received but cursory attention.  The examination should not require too much time for writing. The several hours' continuous nervous tension sometimes exacted by too ambitious teachers does the average child more harm than the examination can possibly do him good.  The examination should consist of questions that will jointly or severally test the student's powers of description, generalization, and analysis. They should test his knowledge of the sequence of events, his ability to use a library or a map, his knowledge of the various phases and the various periods of the history studied. In every examination there should be at least one question dealing with the time and the order of events, one each on the geographical, political, and social history, one that is analytical, one that requires generalization, one that will test his knowledge of the library, and one that will test his powers of description. It is not necessary to limit the questions to the customary number of ten. It is frequently advisable to give a class some degree of choice in the selection of their questions by requiring any ten out of a larger number asked. Certainly such a plan gives the student a more favorable opportunity to demonstrate his ability without in the least diminishing the value of the examination.  Examination questions, like all other questions, should be definite, clean-cut, and reasonable. If possible, each student should be supplied with a copy, instead of having the set written on the board. They should cover only those portions of the subject that have been properly taught. The teacher should not expect the boy who has kept no useful notes, whose library work has been haphazard, and whose methods of study have not been supervised, to perform at examination time the miracle of accurately remembering what he has never been properly taught.
