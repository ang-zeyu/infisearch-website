Father, and Charles, and Lucy, and I went to the beach yesterday. We took our dinner, and stayed all day.  2. Father and Charles went out a little way from the shore in a boat, and fished, while Lucy and I gathered sea mosses.  3. We took off our shoes and stockings, and waded into the shallow water. We had a pail to put our seaweeds in.  4. We found such beautiful ones. Some wore purple, some pink, and some brown. When they were spread out in the water, the purple ones looked like plumes, and the brown ones like little trees.  5. Such a funny thing happened to Lucy. She slipped on a stone, and down she went into the water. How we both laughed! But the wind and sun soon dried Lucy's dress.  6. Then father came and took us in the boat for a row. After that we had a picnic dinner in the woods.  7. Then father spread his coat on the grass, and took a nap while we children played on the beach.

Ralph Wick was seven years old. In most things he was a fine boy, but he was too apt to cry.  2. When he could not have what. he wanted, he would cry for it and say, \"I will have it.\"  3. If he was told that it would hurt him, and he could not have it, he would begin to tease and cry.  4. One day, he went with his mother into the fields. The sun shone. The grass was cut. The flowers were in bloom.  5. Ralph thought he was, for once, a good boy. A smile was on his face. He wished to do as he was told.  6. He said, \"Mother, I will be good now. I will do as you bid me. Please let me toss this hay.\"  7. \"That I will,\" said his mother. So they threw the hay, as Ralph wished, and he was very happy.  8. \"Now you must be tired,\" said his mother. \"Sit down here, and I will get a nice red rose for you.\"  9. \"I would like to have one,\" said Ralph. So his mother brought the red rose to him.  10. \"Thank you, mother,\" he said. \"But you have a white one, also. Please give me that.\"  [Illustration: Mother and boy sitting in field.]  11. \"No, my dear,\" said his mother. \"See how many thorns it has on its stem. You must not touch it. If you should try to pluck a rose like this, you would be sure to hurt your hand.\"  12. When Ralph found that he could not have the white rose, he began to scream, and snatched it. But he was soon very sorry. The thorns tore his hand. It was so sore he could not use it for some time.  13. Ralph did not soon forget this. When he wanted what he should not have, his mother would point to his sore hand. He at last learned to do as he was told.

On a summer day, a man sitting on the bank of a river, in the shade of some bushes, watched a flock of ducks on the stream.  2. Soon a branch with leaves came drifting among them, and they all took wing. After circling in the air for a little time, they settled down again on their feeding ground.  [Illustration: Fox watching ducks from a distance.]  3. Soon another branch came drifting down among them, and again they took flight from the river; but when they found the branch had drifted by and done them no harm, they flew down to the water as before.  4. After four or five branches had drifted by in this way, the ducks gave little heed to them. At length, they hardly tried to fly out of their way, even when the branches nearly touched them.  5. The man who had been watching all this, now began to wonder who had set these branches adrift. He looked up the stream, and spied a fox slyly watching the ducks. \"What will he do next?\" thought the man.  6. When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the branches, he took a much larger branch than any he had yet used, and stretched himself upon it so as to be almost hidden. Then he set it afloat as he had the others.  7. Right among the flock drifted the sly old fox, and, making quick snaps to right and left, he seized two fine young ducks, and floated off with them.  8. The rest of the flock flew away in fright, and did not come back for a long time.  9. The fox must have had a fine dinner to pay him for his cunning, patient work.

The spider wears a plain brown dress,      And she is a steady spinner;    To see her, quiet as a mouse,    Going about her silver house,    You would never, never, never guess      The way she gets her dinner.  2. She looks as if no thought of ill      In all her life had stirred her;    But while she moves with careful tread, And    while she spins her silken thread,    She is planning, planning, planning still      The way to do some murder.  3. My child, who reads this simple lay,      With eyes down-dropt and tender, Remember    the old proverb says    That pretty is which pretty does,    And that worth does not go nor stay      For poverty nor splendor.  4. 'Tis not the house, and not the dress,      That makes the saint or sinner.    To see the spider sit and spin,    Shut with her walls of silver in,    You would never, never, never guess      The way she gets her dinner.                                           Alice Cary.

Peter Pindar was a great storyteller. One day, as he was going by the school, the children gathered around him.  2. They said, \"Please tell us a story we have never heard.\" Ned said, \"'Tell us something about boys and dogs.\"  3. \"Well,\" said Peter, \"I love to please good children, and, as you all appear  civil, I will tell you a new story; and it shall be about a boy and some dogs, as Ned asks.  4. \"But before we begin, let us sit down in a cool, shady place. And now, John, you must be as still as a little mouse. Mary, you must not let Towser bark or make a noise.  5. \"A long way from this place, there is a land where it is very cold, and much snow falls.  6. \"The hills are very high there, and traveler's are often lost among them. There are men there who keep large dogs. These are taught to hunt for people lost in the snow.  7. \"The dogs have so fine a scent, that they can find persons by that alone.  8. \"Sometimes it is so dark, that they can not see anything. Those who are lost often lie hid in the snowdrifts. \"    LESSON LI.  lain    weak    stiff    shrill    rode    bleak   [Illustration: Dog searching on snowy mountain-side for lost traveler.]   THE STORY TELLER (CONCLUDED)  1. \"One cold, bleak night, the snow fell fast, and the wind blew loud and shrill. It was quite dark. Not a star was to be seen in the sky.  2. \"These good men sent out a dog, to hunt for those who might want help. In an hour or two, the dog was heard coming back.  3. \"On looking out, they saw him with a boy on his back. The poor child was stiff with cold. He could but just hold on to the dog's back.  4. \"He had lain for a long time in the snow, and was too weak to walk.  5. \"He felt something pull him by the coat, and heard the bark of a dog. He put out his hand, and felt the dog. The dog gave him another pull.  6. \"This gave the poor boy some hope, and he took hold of the dog. He drew himself out of the snow, but ho could not stand or walk.  7. \"He got on the dog's back, and put his arms round the dog's neck, and held on. He felt sure that the dog did not mean to do him any harm.  8. \"Thus he rode all the way to the good men's house.  9. \"They took care of him, till the snow was gone. Then they sent him to his home.\"    LESSON LII.  oak    dusk    fight    squeak     ruf'fled  bag    Fred    whoo     a wake'    creep'ing   THE OWL.  1. \"Where did you get that owl, Harry?\"  2. \"Fred and I found him in the old, hollow oak.\"  3. \"How did you know he was there?\"  4. \"I'll tell you. Fred and I were playing 'hide and seek' round the old barn, one night just at dusk.  5. \"I was just creeping round the corner, when I heard a loud squeak, and a big bird flew up with something in his claws.  6. \"I called Fred, and we watched him as he flew to the woods.

A young owl can be tamed easily, but this one is too old to tame.\"  3. \"But won't he catch all your ducklings and little chickens?\"  4. \"No, not while there are any rats or mice around. Father says an owl is a good mouser, and can catch more mice than half a dozen cats.\"  5. \"I'm glad I had a look at him before you let him go. What soft feathers he has!\"  6. \"Yes, he can fly so softly that you can scarcely hear him, and for this reason he can easily surprise and capture his prey.\"  7. \"How comical he looks, winking his big eyes slowly, and turning his head from side to side!\"  [Illustration: Two boys talking.]  8. \"Yes; he is watching your dog.

The broad leaves were green and fresh.  3. \"We looked up at the ripe, purple figs. And what do you think came down through the branches of the fig tree over our heads?\"  4. \"Oh, a bird, grandfather, a bird!\" said little Jane, clapping her hands.  5. \"No, not a bird. It was a fish; a trout, my little girl.\"  6. \"Not a fish, grandfather! A trout come through the branches of a tree in the city'! I am sure you must be in fun.\"  7. \"No, Jane, I tell you the truth. My friend and I were very much surprised to see a fish falling from a fig tree.  8. \"But we ran from under the tree, and saw a fishhawk flying, and an eagle after him.  9. \"The hawk had caught the fish, and was carrying it home to his nest, when the eagle saw it and wanted it.  10. \"They fought for it. The fish was dropped, and they both lost it. So much for fighting!\"    LESSON LV.  flow    wide    steep    lakes    twin'kling  [Illustration: Lake in foreground; mountain in background.]   GOD IS GREAT AND GOOD.  1. I know God made the sun      To fill the day with light;    He made the twinkling stars      To shine all through the night.  2. He made the hills that rise      So very high and steep;    He made the lakes and seas,      That are so broad and deep.  3. He made the streams so wide,      That flow through wood and vale;    He made the rills so small,      That leap down hill and dale.  4. He made each bird that sings      So sweetly all the day;    He made each flower that springs      So bright, so fresh, so gay.  5. And He who made all these,      He made both you and me;    Oh, let us thank Him, then,      For great and good is He.    LESSON LVI.  hoe      grave    knock     ex cept'  droll    hymn     prayed    cot'tage  [Illustration: Old man holding two little girls.]   A GOOD OLD MAN.  1.  There once lived an old man in a snug, little cottage. It had two rooms and only two windows. A small garden lay just behind it.  2. Old as the poor man was, he used to work in the fields. Often he would come home very tired and weak, with his hoe or spade on his shoulder.  3. And who do you think met him at the door! Mary and Jane, his two little grandchildren.  4. They were too young to work, except to weed in the garden, or bring water from the spring.  5. In winter, as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal, they had little fire; so they used to sit close together to keep warm. Mary would sit on one of the old man's knees, and Jane on the other.  6. Sometimes their grandfather would tell them a droll story. Sometimes he would teach them a hymn.  7. He would often talk to them of their father, who had gone to sea, or of their good, kind mother, who was in her grave. Every night he prayed God to bless them, and to bring back their father in safety.  8. The old man grew weaker every year; but the little girls were glad to work for him, who had been so good to them.  [Illustration: Girls and grandfather greeting father at door.]  9. One cold, windy night, they heard a knock at the door. The little girls ran and opened it. Oh, joy to them! There stood their father.  10. He had been at sea a long time. He had saved some money, and had now come home to stay.  11. After this the old man did not have to work. His son worked for him, and his grandchildren took care of him. Many happy days they spent together.    LESSON LVII.  hoe      grave    knock     ex cept'  droll    hymn     prayed    cot'tage   THE GREEDY GIRL.   1. Laura English is a greedy little girl. Indeed, she is quite a glutton. Do you know what a glutton is? A glutton is one who eats too much, because the food tastes well.  2. Laura's mother is always willing she should have as much to eat as is good for her; but sometimes, when her mother is not watching, she eats so much that it makes her sick.  3. I do not know why she is so silly. Her kitten never eats more than it needs. It leaves the nice bones on the plate, and lies down to sleep when it has eaten enough.  4. The bee is wiser than Laura. It flies all day among the flowers to gather honey, and might eat the whole time if it pleased. But it eats just enough, and carries all the rest to its hive.  [Illustration: Heavy girl eating two apples. Plate on floor with food scraps. Cat lying on footstool.]  5. The squirrel eats a few nuts or acorns, and frisks about as gayly as if he had dined at the king's table.  6. Did you ever see a squirrel with a nut in his paws? How bright and lively he looks as he eats it!  7. If he lived in a house made of acorns, he would never need a doctor. He would not eat an acorn too much.  8. I do not love little girls who eat too much. Do you, my little readers?  9. I do not think they have such rosy cheeks, or such bright eyes, or such sweet, happy tempers as those who eat less.

I wish you would lend me your thimble,        Sarah. I can never find my own.  Sarah. Why is it, Mary, you can never find it?  Mary.  How can I tell? But if you will not lend me        yours, I can borrow one elsewhere.  Sarah. I am willing to lend mine to you, Mary.        But I would very much like to know why you come        to me to borrow so often.  [Illustration: Two girls seated, talking.]  Mary.  Because you never lose any of your things,        and always know where to find them.  Sarah. And why do I always know where to find my things?  Mary.  I do not know why, I am sure. If I did        know, I might sometimes find my own.  Sarah. I will tell you the secret. I have a place for        everything, and I put everything in its place when I        have done using it.  Mary.  O Sarah! who wants to run and put away a        thing as soon as she has used it, as if her life        depended upon it?  Sarah. Our life does not depend upon it, but our        comfort does, surely. How much more time will it        take to put a thing in its place, than to hunt for it or        to borrow whenever you want to use it ?  Mary.  Well, Sarah, I will never borrow of you        again, you may depend upon it.  Sarah. You are not offended with me, I hope.  Mary.  No, but I am ashamed. Before night, I will        have a place for everything, and then I will keep        everything in its place. You have taught me a lesson        that I shall remember.

George Ellet had a bright silver dollar for a New-year gift.  2. He thought of all the fine things he might buy with it.  3. The ground was all covered with snow; but the sun shone out bright, and everything looked beautiful.  4. So George put on his hat, and ran into the street. As he went skipping along, he met some boys throwing snowballs. George soon engaged in the sport.  5. He sent a ball at James Mason, but it missed him, and broke a window on the other side of the street.  6."]]]
