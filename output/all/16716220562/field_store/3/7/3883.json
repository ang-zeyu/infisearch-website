Garfield (#4)"],["body"," He received fifty dollars in good money and paid back the same, didn't he?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Whatever he lost his customer made, didn't he?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, the man walked off with forty-five dollars and a pair of boots. The other five dollars the shoemaker kept himself.\"  \"That's so, Jim. I see it now, but it's rather puzzling at first. Did you make that out yourself?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you've got a good head--better than I expected. Have you got any more questions?\"  \"Just a few.\"  So the boy continued to ask questions, and the captain was more than once obliged to confess that he could not answer. He began to form a new opinion of his young cousin, who, though he filled the humble position of a canal-boy, appeared to be well equipped with knowledge.  \"I guess that'll do, Jim,\" he said after a while. \"You've got ahead of me, though I didn't expect it. A boy with such a head as you've got ought not to be on the tow-path.\"  \"What ought I to be doing, cousin?\"  \"You ought to keep school. You're better qualified than I am to-day, and yet I taught for three winters in Indiana.\"  James was pleased with this tribute to his acquirements, especially from a former schoolmaster.  \"I never thought of that,\" he said. \"I'm too young to keep school. I'm only fifteen.\"  \"That is rather young. You know enough; but I aint sure that you could tackle some of the big boys that would be coming to school. You know enough, but you need more muscle. I'll tell you what I advise. Stay with me this summer--it won't do you any hurt, and you'll be earning something--then go to school a term or two, and by that time you'll be qualified to teach a district school.\"  \"I'll think of what you say, cousin,\" said James, thoughtfully. \"I don't know but your advice is good.\"  It is not always easy to say what circumstances have most influence in shaping the destiny of a boy, but it seems probable that the conversation which has just been detailed, and the discovery that he was quite equal in knowledge to a man who had been a schoolmaster, may have put new ideas into the boy's head, destined to bear fruit later.  For the present, however, his duties as a canal-boy must be attended to, and they were soon to be resumed.  About ten o'clock that night, when James was on duty, the boat approached the town of Akron, where there were twenty-one locks to be successively passed through.  The night was dark, and, though the bowman of the _Evening Star_ did not see it, another boat had reached the same lock from the opposite direction. Now in such cases the old rule, \"first come, first served,\" properly prevailed.  The bowman had directed the gates to be thrown open, in order that the boat might enter the lock, when a voice was heard through the darkness, \"Hold on, there! Our boat is just round the bend, ready to enter.\"  \"We have as much right as you,\" said the bowman.  As he spoke he commenced turning the gate.  My young reader will understand from the description already given that it will not do to have both lower and upper gates open at the same time. Of course, one or the other boat must wait.  Both bowmen were determined to be first, and neither was willing to yield. Both boats were near the lock, their head-lights shining as bright as day, and the spirit of antagonism reached and affected the crews of both.  Captain Letcher felt called upon to interfere lest there should be serious trouble.  He beckoned to his bowman.  \"Were you here first?\" he asked.  \"It is hard to tell,\" answered the bowman, \"but I'm bound to have the lock, anyhow.\"  The captain was not wholly unaffected by the spirit of antagonism which his bowman displayed.  \"All right; just as you say,\" he answered, and it seemed likely that conflict was inevitable.  James Garfield had been an attentive observer, and an attentive listener to what had been said. He had formed his own ideas of what was right to be done.  \"Look here, captain,\" he said, tapping Captain Letcher on the arm, \"does this lock belong to us?\"  \"I really suppose, according to law, it does not; but we will have it, anyhow.\"  \"No, we will not,\" replied the boy.  \"And why not?\" asked the captain, naturally surprised at such a speech from his young driver.  \"Because it does not belong to us.\"  The captain was privately of opinion that the boy was right, yet but for his remonstrance he would have stood out against the claims of the rival boat. He took but brief time for considerations, and announced his decision.  \"Boys,\" he said to his men, \"Jim is right. Let them have the lock.\"  Of course there was no more trouble, but the bowman, and the others connected with the _Evening Star_, were angry. It irritated them to be obliged to give up the point, and wait humbly till the other boat had passed through the lock.  The steersman was George Lee. When breakfast was called, he sat down by James.  \"What is the matter with you, Jim?\" he asked.  \"Nothing at all.\"  \"What made you so for giving up the lock last night?\"  \"Because it wasn't ours. The other boat had it by right.\"  \"Jim, you are a coward,\" said Lee contemptuously. \"You aint fit for a boatman. You'd better go back to the farm and chop wood or milk cows, for a man or boy isn't fit for this business that isn't ready to fight for his rights.\"  James did not answer. Probably he saw that it would be of no use. George Lee was for his own boat, right or wrong; but James had already begun to reflect upon the immutable principles of right or wrong, and he did not suffer his reason to be influenced by any considerations touching his own interests or his own pride.  As to the charge of cowardice it did not trouble him much. On a suitable occasion later on (we shall tell the story in due season) he showed that he was willing to contend for his rights, when he was satisfied that the right was on his side.     CHAPTER VI.  JAMES LEAVES THE CANAL.   James was not long to fill the humble position of driver. Before the close of the first trip he was promoted to the more responsible office of bowman. Whether his wages were increased we are not informed.  It may be well in this place to mention that a canal boat required, besides the captain, two drivers, two steersmen, a bowman, and a cook, the last perhaps not the least important of the seven. \"The bowman's business was to stop the boat as it entered the lock, by throwing the bowline that was attached to the bow of the boat around the snubbing post.\" It was to this position that James was promoted, though I have some doubt whether the place of driver, with the opportunities it afforded of riding on horse or mule-back, did not suit him better. Still, promotion is always pleasant, and in this case it showed that the boy had discharged his humbler duties satisfactorily.  I have said that the time came when James showed that he was not a coward. Edmund Kirke, in his admirable life of Garfield, has condensed the captain's account of the occurrence, and I quote it here as likely to prove interesting to my boy readers:  \"The _Evening Star_ was at Beaver, and a steamboat was ready to tow her up to Pittsburg. The boy was standing on deck with the selting-pole against his shoulders, and some feet away stood Murphy, one of the boat hands, a big, burly fellow of thirty-five, when the steamboat threw the line, and, owing to a sudden lurch of the boat, it whirled over the boy's head, and flew in the direction of the boatman. 'Look out, Murphy!' cried the boy; but the rope had anticipated him, and knocked Murphy's hat off into the river. The boy expressed his regret, but it was of no avail. In a towering rage the man rushed upon him, with his head down, like a maddened animal; but, stepping nimbly aside, the boy dealt him a powerful blow behind the ear, and he tumbled to the bottom of the boat among the copper ore. Before he could rise the boy was upon him, one hand upon his throat, the other raised for another blow upon his frontispiece.  \"'Pound the cussed fool, Jim!' cried Captain Letcher, who was looking on appreciatingly. 'If he haint no more sense'n to get mad at accidents, giv it ter him! Why don't you strike?'  \"But the boy did not strike, for the man was down and in his power. Murphy expressed regret for his rage, and then Garfield gave him his hand, and they became better friends than ever before. This victory of a boy of sixteen over a man of thirty-five obliterated the notion of young Garfield's character for cowardice, and gave him a great reputation among his associates. The incident is still well remembered among the boatmen of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal.\"  The boy's speedy reconciliation to the man who had made so unprovoked an assault upon him was characteristic of his nature. He never could cherish malice, and it was very hard work for him to remain angry with any one, however great the provocation.  Both as a boy and as a man he possessed great physical strength, as may be inferred from an incident told by the Boston _Journal_ of his life when he was no longer the humble canal-boy, but a brigadier-general in the army:  \"At Pittsburg Landing one night in 1862 there was a rush for rations by some newly-arrived troops. One strong, fine-looking soldier presented a requisition for a barrel of flour, _and, shouldering it, walked off with ease_. When the wagon was loaded, this same man stepped up to Colonel Morton, commanding the commissary steamers there, and remarked, 'I suppose you require a receipt for these supplies?' 'Yes,' said the Colonel, as he handed over the usual blank; 'just take this provision return, and have it signed by your commanding officer.' 'Can't I sign it?' was the reply. 'Oh, no,' said the affable Colonel Morton; 'it requires the signature of a commissioned officer.' Then came the remark, that still remains fresh in the Colonel's memory: 'I am a commissioned officer--I'm a brigadier-general, and my name is Garfield, of Ohio.'\"  For four months James remained connected with the canal-boat.

Garfield (#5)"],["body","so free from danger as it is supposed to be, it may be stated that in this short time he fell into the water fourteen times. Usually he scrambled out without further harm than a good wetting. One night, however, he was in serious pain.  It was midnight, and rainy, when he was called up to take his turn at the bow. The boat was leaving one of those long reaches of slack-water which abound in the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal. He tumbled out of bed in a hurry, but half awake, and, taking his stand on the narrow platform below the bow-deck, he began uncoiling a rope to steady the boat through a lock it was approaching. Finally it knotted, and caught in a narrow cleft on the edge of the deck. He gave it a strong pull, then another, till it gave way, sending him over the bow into the water. Down he went in the dark river, and, rising, was bewildered amid the intense darkness. It seemed as if the boy's brief career was at its close. But he was saved as by a miracle. Reaching out his hand in the darkness, it came in contact with the rope. Holding firmly to it as it tightened in his grasp, he used his strong arms to draw himself up hand over hand. His deliverance was due to a knot in the rope catching in a crevice, thus, as it tightened, sustaining him and enabling him to climb on deck.  It was a narrow escape, and he felt it to be so. He was a thoughtful boy, and it impressed him. The chances had been strongly against him, yet he had been saved.  \"God did it,\" thought James reverently, \"He has saved my life against large odds, and He must have saved it for some purpose. He has some work for me to do.\"  Few boys at his age would have taken the matter so seriously, yet in the light of after events shall we not say that James was right, and that God did have some work for him to perform?  This work, the boy decided, was not likely to be the one he was at present engaged in. The work of a driver or a bowman on a canal is doubtless useful in its way, but James doubted whether he would be providentially set apart for any such business.  It might have been this deliverance that turned his attention to religious matters. At any rate, hearing that at Bedford there was a series of protracted meetings conducted by the Disciples, as they were called, he made a trip there, and became seriously impressed. There, too, he met a gentleman who was destined to exert an important influence over his destiny.  This gentleman was Dr. J.P. Robinson, who may be still living. Dr. Robinson took a great liking to the boy, and sought to be of service to him. He employed him, though it may have been at a later period, to chop wood, and take care of his garden, and do chores about the house, and years afterward, as we shall see, it was he that enabled James to enter Williams College, and pursue his studies there until he graduated, and was ready to do the work of an educated man in the world. But we must not anticipate.  Though James was strong and healthy he was not proof against the disease that lurked in the low lands bordering on the canal. He was attacked by fever and ague, and lay for some months sick at home. It was probably the only long sickness he had till the fatal wound which laid him on his bed when in the fullness of his fame he had taken his place among kings and rulers. It is needless to say that he had every attention that a tender mother could bestow, and in time he was restored to health.  During his sickness he had many talks with his mother upon his future prospects, and the course of life upon which it was best for him to enter. He had not yet given up all thoughts of the sea, he had not forgotten the charms with which a sailor's life is invested in Marryatt's fascinating novels. His mother listened anxiously to his dreams of happiness on the sea, and strove to fix his mind upon higher things--to inspire him with a nobler ambition.  \"What would you have me do, mother?\" he asked.  \"If you go back to the canal, my son, with the seeds of this disease lurking in your system, I fear you will be taken down again. I have thought it over. It seems to me you had better go to school this spring, and then, with a term in the fall, you may be able to teach in the winter. If you teach winters, and work on the canal or lake summers, you will have employment the year round.\"  Nevertheless Mrs. Garfield was probably not in favor of his spending his summers in the way indicated. She felt, however, that her son, who was a boy like other boys, must be gradually weaned from the dreams that had bewitched his fancy.  Then his mother proposed a practical plan.  \"You have been obliged to spend all your money,\" she said, \"but your brother Thomas and I will be able to raise seventeen dollars for you to start to school on, and when that is gone perhaps you will be able to get along on your own resources.\"     CHAPTER VII.  THE CHOICE OF A VOCATION   James Garfield's experience on the canal was over. The position was such an humble one that it did not seem likely to be of any service in the larger career which one day was to open before him. But years afterward, when as a brigadier-general of volunteers he made an expedition into Eastern Kentucky, he realized advantage from his four months' experience on the canal. His command had run short of provisions, and a boat had been sent for supplies, but the river beside which the men were encamped had risen so high that the boat dared not attempt to go up the river. Then General Garfield, calling to his aid the skill with which he had guided the _Evening Star_ at the age of fifteen, took command of the craft, stood at the wheel forty-four hours out of the forty-eight, and brought the supplies to his men at a time when they were eating their last crackers.  \"Seek all knowledge, however trifling,\" says an eminent author, \"and there will come a time when you can make use of it.\"  James may never have read this remark, but he was continually acting upon it, and the spare moments which others devoted to recreation he used in adding to his stock of general knowledge.  The last chapter closes with Mrs. Garfield's advice to James to give up his plan of going to sea, and to commence and carry forward a course of education which should qualify him for a college professor, or a professional career. Her words made some impression upon his mind, but it is not always easy to displace cherished dreams. While she was talking, a knock was heard at the door and Mrs. Garfield, leaving her place at her son's bedside, rose and opened it.  \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Bates,\" she said with a welcoming smile.  Samuel D. Bates was the teacher of the school near by, an earnest young man, of exemplary habits, who was looking to the ministry as his chosen vocation.  \"And how is James to-day?\" asked the teacher, glancing toward the bed.  \"So well that he is already beginning to make plans for the future,\" answered his mother.  \"What are your plans, James?\" asked the young man.  \"I should like best to go to sea,\" said James, \"but mother doesn't approve of it.\"  \"She is wise,\" said Bates, promptly. \"You would find it a great disappointment.\"  \"But, it must be delightful to skim over the waters, and visit countries far away,\" said the boy, his cheeks flushing, and his eyes glowing with enthusiasm.  \"You think so now; but remember, you would be a poor, ignorant sailor, and would have to stay by the ship instead of exploring the wonderful cities at which the ship touched. Of course, you would have an occasional run on shore, but you could not shake off the degrading associations with which your life on shipboard would surround you.\"  \"Why should a sailor's life be degrading?\" asked James.  \"It need not be necessarily, but as a matter of fact most sailors have low aims and are addicted to bad habits. Better wait till you can go to sea as a passenger, and enjoy to the full the benefits of foreign travel.\"  \"There is something in that,\" said James, thoughtfully. \"If I could only be sure of going some day.\"  \"Wouldn't it be pleasant to go as a man of culture, as a college professor, as a minister, or as a lawyer, able to meet on equal terms foreign scholars and gentlemen?\"  This was a new way of putting it, and produced a favorable impression on the boy's mind. Still, the boy had doubts, and expressed them freely.  \"That sounds well,\" he said; \"but how am I to know that I have brain enough to make a college professor, or a minister, or a lawyer?\"  \"I don't think there is much doubt on that point,\" said Bates, noting the bright, expressive face, and luminous eyes of the sick boy. \"I should be willing to guarantee your capacity. Don't you think yourself fit for anything better than a common sailor?\"  \"Yes,\" answered James. \"I think I could make a good carpenter, for I know something about that trade already, and I daresay I could make a good trader if I could find an opening to learn the business; but it takes a superior man to succeed in the positions you mention.\"  \"There are plenty of men with only average ability who get along very creditably; but I advise you, if you make up your mind to enter the lists, to try for a high place.\"  The boy's eyes sparkled with new ambition. It was a favorite idea with him afterward, that every man ought to feel an honorable ambition to succeed as well as possible in his chosen path.  \"One thing more,\" added Bates. \"I don't think you have any right to become a sailor.\"  \"No right? Oh, you mean because mother objects.\"  \"That, certainly, ought to weigh with you as a good son; but I referred to something else.\"  \"What then?\"  \"Do you remember the parable of the talents?\"  James had been brought up by his mother, who was a devoted religious woman, to read the Bible, and he answered in the affirmative.  \"It seems to me that you are responsible for the talents which God has bestowed upon you. If you have the ability or the brain, as you call it, to insure success in a literary career, don't you think you would"]]]
