If the bird and the bee, little boy, were too late, Remember, as you play along On your way to school, with pencil and slate, Never stay a moment too long.  LESSON XXI.   HUMMING BIRDS. 1. The most beautiful humming birds are found in the West Indies and South America. The crest of the tiny head of one of these shines like a sparkling crown of colored light. 2. The shades of color that adorn its breast, are equally brilliant. As the bird   58  ECLECTIC SERIES. flits from one object to another, it looks more like a bright flash of sunlight than it does like a living being. 3. But, you ask, why are they called humming birds? It is because they make a soft, humming noise by the rapid motion of their wings--a motion so rapid, that as they fly you can only see that they have wings. 4. One day when walking in the woods, I found the nest of one of the smallest humming birds. It was about half the size of a very small hen's egg, and   THIRD READER.  59 was attached to a twig no thicker than a steel knitting needle. 5. It seemed to have been made of cotton fibers, and was covered with the softest bits of leaf and bark. It had two eggs in it, quite white, and each about as large as a small sugarplum. 6. When you approach the spot where one of these birds has built its nest, it is necessary to be careful. The mother bird will dart at you and try to peck your eyes. Its sharp beak may hurt your eyes most severely, and even destroy the sight. 7. The poor little thing knows no other way of defending its young, and instinct teaches it that you might carry off its nest if you could find it.  LESSON XXII.    THE WIND AND THE SUN. A FABLE. 1. A dispute once arose between the Wind and the Sun, as to which was the stronger.   60  ECLECTIC SERIES. 2. To decide the matter, they agreed to try their power on a traveler. That party which should first strip him of his cloak, was to win the day. 3. The Wind began. He blew a cutting blast, which tore up the mountain oaks by their roots, and made the whole forest look like a wreck. 4. But the traveler, though at first he could scarcely keep his cloak on his back, ran under a hill for shelter, and buckled his mantle about him more closely. 5. The Wind having thus tried his utmost power in vain, the Sun began. 6. Bursting through a thick cloud, he darted his sultry beams so forcibly upon the traveler's head, that the poor fellow was almost melted. 7. \"This,\" said he, \"is past all bearing. It is so hot, that one might as well be in an oven.\" 8. So he quickly threw off his cloak, and went into the shade of a tree to cool himself. 9. This fable teaches us, that gentle means will often succeed where forcible ones will fail.    THIRD READER.  61  LESSON XXIII.     SUNSET.     62  ECLECTIC SERIES,    LESSON XXIV.    BEAUTIFUL HANDS. 1. \"O Miss Roberts! what coarse-looking hands Mary Jessup has!\" said Daisy Marvin, as she walked home from school with her teacher.   THIRD READER.  63 2. \"In my opinion, Daisy, Mary's hands are the prettiest in he class.\" 3. \"Why, Miss Roberts, they are as red and hard as they can be. How they would look if she were to try to play on a piano!\" exclaimed Daisy. 4. Miss Roberts took Daisy's hands in hers, and said, \"Your hands are very soft and white, Daisy--just the hands to look beautiful on a piano; yet they lack one beauty that Mary's hands have. Shall I tell you what the difference is?\" 5.  \"Yes, please, Miss Roberts.\" 6. \"Well, Daisy, Mary's hands are always busy. They wash dishes; they make fires; they hang out clothes, and help to wash them, too; they sweep, and dust, and sew; they are always trying to help her poor, hard-working mother. 7. \"Besides, they wash and dress the children; they mend their toys and dress their dolls; yet, they find time to bathe the head of the little girl who is so sick in the next house to theirs. 8. \"They are full of good deeds to every living thing. I have seen them patting the tired horse and the lame dog in the street.   64  ECLECTIC SERIES,   They are always ready to help those who need help.\" 9. \"I shall never think Mary's hands are ugly any more, Miss Roberts.\" 10. \"I am glad to hear you say that, Daisy; and I must tell you that they are beautiful because they do their work gladly and cheerfully.\" 11. \"O Miss Roberts! I feel so ashamed of myself, and so sorry,\" said Daisy, looking into her teacher's face with tearful eyes.   THIRD READER.  65 12. \"Then, my dear, show your sorrow by deeds of kindness. The good alone are really beautiful.\"  LESSON XXV.  THINGS TO REMEMBER. 1. When you rise in the morning, remember who kept you from danger during the night. Remember who watched over you while you slept, and whose sun shines around you, and gives you the sweet light of day. 2. Let God have the thanks of your heart, for his kindness and his care; and pray for his protection during the wakeful hours of day. 3. Remember that God made all creatures to be happy, and will do nothing that may prevent their being so, without good reason for it. 4. When you are at the table, do not eat in a greedy manner, like a pig. Eat quietly, 3,5  66  ECLECTIC SERIES. and do not reach forth your hand for the food, but ask some one to help you. 5. Do not become peevish and pout, because you do not get a part of everything. Be satisfied with what is given you. 6. Avoid a pouting face, angry looks, and angry words. Do not slam the doors. Go quietly up and down stairs; and never make a loud noise about the house. 7. Be kind and gentle in your manners; not like the howling winter storm, but like the bright summer morning. 8. Do always as your parents bid you. Obey them with a ready mind, and with a pleasant face. 9. Never do anything that you would be afraid or ashamed that your parents should know. Remember, if no one else sees you, God does, from whom you can not hide even your most secret thought. 10. At night, before you go to sleep, think whether you have done anything that was wrong during the day, and pray to God to forgive you. If anyone has done you wrong, forgive him in your heart. 11. If you have not learned something useful, or been in some way useful, during   THIRD READER.  67 the past day, think that it is a day lost, and be very sorry for it. 12. Trust in the Lord, and He will guide you in the way of good men. The path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 13. We must do all the good we can to all men, for this is well pleasing in the sight of God. He delights to see his children walk in love, and do good one to another.  LESSON XXVI.  THREE LITTLE MICE. 1. I will tell you the story of three little mice, If you will keep still and listen to me, Who live in a cage that is cozy and nice, And are just as cunning as cunning can be. They look very wise, with their pretty red eyes, That seem just exactly like little round beads; They are white as the snow, and stand up in a row Whenever we do not attend to their needs;--   68  ECLECTIC SERIES.   2. Stand up in a row in a comical way,-- Now folding their forepaws as if saying, \"please;\" Now rattling the lattice, as much as to say, \"We shall not stay here without more bread and cheese,\" They are not at all shy, as you'll find, if you try To make them run up in their chamber to bed; If they do n't want to go, why, they won't go--ah! no, Though you tap with your finger each queer little head. 3. One day as I stood by the side of the cage, Through the bars there protruded a funny, round tail;   THIRD READER.  69  Just for mischief I caught it, and soon; in a rage, Its owner set up a most pitiful wail. He looked in dismay,--there was something to pay,-- But what was the matter he could not make out; What was holding him so, when he wanted to go To see what his brothers upstairs were about?  4. But soon from the chamber the others rushed down, Impatient to learn what the trouble might be; I have not a doubt that each brow wore a frown, Only frowns on their brows are not easy to see. For a moment they gazed, perplexed and amazed; Then began both together to--gnaw off the tail! So, quick I released him,--do you think that it pleased him? And up the small staircase they fled like a gale. Julia C. R. Dorr. LESSON XXVII.  THE NEW YEAR. 1. One pleasant New-year morning, Edward rose, and washed and dressed himself   70  ECLECTIC SERIES. in haste. He wanted to be first to wish a happy New Year. 2. He looked in every room, and shouted the words of welcome. He ran into the  street, to repeat them to those he might meet. 3. When he came back, his father gave him two bright, new silver dollars. 4. His face lighted up as he took them. He had wished for a long time to buy some pretty books that he had seen at the bookstore.   THIRD READER.  71 5. He left the house with a light heart, intending to buy the books. 6. As he ran down the street, he saw a poor German family, the father, mother, and three children shivering with cold. 7. \"I wish you a happy New Year,\" said Edward, as he was gayly passing on. The man shook his head. 8. \"You do not belong to this country,\" said Edward. The man again shook his head, for he could not understand or speak our language. 9. But he pointed to his mouth, and to the children, as if to say, \"These little ones have had nothing to eat for a long time.\" 10. Edward quickly understood that these poor people were in distress. He took out his dollars, and gave one to the man, and the other to his wife. 11. How their eyes sparkled with gratitude! They said something in their language, which doubtless meant, \"We thank you a thousand times, and will remember you in our prayers.\" 12. When Edward came home, his father asked what books he had bought. He hung his head a moment, but quickly looked up.   72  ECLECTIC SERIES. 13. \"I have bought no books,\" said he, \"I gave my money to some poor people, who seemed to be very hungry and wretched. 14. \"I think I can wait for my books till next New Year. Oh, if you had seen "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],["title","McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#5)"],["body","glad they were to receive the money!\" 15. \"My dear boy;\" said his father, \"here is a whole bundle of books. I give them to you, more as a reward for your goodness of heart than as a New-year gift. 16. \"I saw you give the money to the poor German family. It was no small sum for a little boy to give cheerfully. 17. \"Be thus ever ready to help the poor, and wretched, and distressed; and every year of your life will be to you a happy New Year.\" LESSON XXVIII.   THE CLOCK AND THE SUNDIAL. A FABLE. 1. One gloomy day, the clock on a church steeple, looking down on a sundial, said,    THIRD READER.  73 \"How stupid it is in you to stand there all the while like a stock! 2. \"You never tell the hour till a bright sun looks forth from the sky, and gives you leave. I go merrily round, day and night, in summer and winter the same, without asking his leave. 3. \"I tell the people the time to rise, to go to dinner, and to come to church.    74  ECLECTIC SERIES. 4. \"Hark! I am going to strike now; one, two, three, four. There it is for you. How silly you look! You can say nothing.\" 5. The sun, at that moment, broke forth from behind a cloud, and showed, by the sundial, that the clock was half an hour behind the right time. 6. The boasting clock now held his tongue, and the dial only smiled at his folly. 7. MORAL.--Humble modesty is more often right than a proud and boasting spirit.  LESSON XXIX.   REMEMBER. 1. Remember, child, remember, That God is in the sky; That He looks down on all we do, With an ever-wakeful eye.  2. Remember, oh remember, That, all the day and night, He sees our thoughts and actions With an ever-watchful sight.   THIRD READER.  75  3. Remember, child, remember, That God is good and true; That He wishes us to always be Like Him in all we do.  4. Remember that He ever hates A falsehood or a lie; Remember He will punish, too, The wicked, by and by.  5. Remember, oh remember, That He is like a friend, And wishes us to holy be, And happy, in the end.  6. Remember, child, remember, To pray to Him in heaven; And if you have been doing wrong, Oh, ask to be forgiven.  7. Be sorry, in your little prayer, And whisper in his ear; Ask his forgiveness and his love. And He will surely hear.  8. Remember, child, remember, That you love, with all your might,   76  ECLECTIC SERIES.  The God who watches o'er us, And gives us each delight; Who guards us ever through the day, And saves us in the night.  LESSON XXX..    COURAGE AND COWARDICE. 1. Robert and Henry were going home from school, when, on turning a corner, Robert cried out, \"A fight! let us go and see!\"   ECLECTIC READER.  77 2. \"No,\" said Henry; \"let us go quietly home and not meddle with this quarrel. We have nothing to do with it, and may get into mischief.\" 3. \"You are a coward, and afraid to go,\" said Robert, and off he ran. Henry went straight home, and in the afternoon went to school, as usual. 4. But Robert had told all the boys that Henry was a coward, and they laughed at him a great deal. 5. Henry had learned, however, that true courage is shown most in bearing reproach when not deserved, and that he ought to be afraid of nothing but doing wrong. 6. A few days after, Robert was bathing with some schoolmates, and got out of his depth. He struggled, and screamed for help, but all in vain. 7. The boys who had called Henry a coward, got out of the water as fast as they could, but they did not even try to help him. 8. Robert was fast sinking, when Henry threw off his clothes, and sprang into the water. He reached Robert just as he was sinking the last time.   78  ECLECTIC SERIES. 9. By great effort, and with much danger to himself, he brought Robert to thc shore, and thus saved his life. 10. Robert and his schoolmates were ashamed at having called Henry a coward. They owned that he had more courage than any of them. 11. Never be afraid to do good, but always fear to do evil.  LESSON XXXI.    WEIGHING AN ELEPHANT. 1. \"An eastern king,\" said Teddy's mother, \"had been saved from some great danger. To show his gratitude for deliverance, he vowed he would give to the poor the weight of his favorite elephant in silver.\" 2. \"Oh! what a great quantity that would be,\" cried Lily, opening her eyes very wide. \"But how could you weigh an elephant?\"   THIRD READER.   79 asked Teddy, who was a quiet, thoughtful boy 3. \"There was the difficulty,\" said his mother. \"The wise and learned men of the court stroked their long beards, and talked the matter over, but no one found out how to weigh the elephant. 4. \"At last, a poor old sailor found safe and simple means by which to weigh the enormous beast. The thousands and thousands of pieces of silver were counted out to the people; and crowds of the poor were relieved by the clever thought of the sailor.\" 5. \"O mamma,\" said Lily, \"do tell us what it was!\" 6. \"Stop, stop!\" said Teddy. \"I want to think for myself-- think hard--and find out how an elephant's weight could be known, with little trouble and expense.\" 7. \"I am well pleased,\" said his mother, \"that my little boy should set his mind to work on the subject. If he can find out the sailor's secret before night, he shall have that orange for his pains.\" 8. The boy thought hard and long. Lily laughed at her brother's grave looks, as he sat leaning his head on his hands. Often   80  ECLECTIC SERIES.    she teased him with the question, \"Can you weigh an elephant, Teddy?\" 9. At last, while eating his supper, Teddy suddenly cried out, \"I have it now!\" 10.  \"Do you think so?\" asked his mother. 11.  \"How would you do it,\" asked Lily.   THIRD READER.  81 12. \"First, I would have a big boat brought very close to the shore, and would have planks laid across, so that the elephant could walk right into it.\" 13. \"Oh, such a great, heavy beast would make it sink low in the water,\" said Lily. 14. \"Of course it would,\" said her brother. Then I would mark on the outside of the boat the exact height to which the water had risen all around it while the elephant was inside. Then he should march on shore, leaving the boat quite empty.\" 15. \"But I do n't see the use of all this,\" said Lily. 16. \"Do n't you?\" cried Teddy, in surprise. \"Why, I should then bring the heaps of silver, and throw them into the boat till their weight would sink it to the mark made by the elephant. That would show that the weight of each was the same.\" 17. \"How funny!\" cried Lily; \"you would make a weighing machine of the boat?\" 18. \"That is my plan,\" said Teddy. 19. \"That was the sailor's plan,\" said his mother. \"You have earned the orange, my boy;\" and she gave it to him with a smile. Adapted from A. L. O. E. 3,6.   82  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XXXII.   THE SOLDIER.  1.  A soldier! a soldier! I'm longing to he: The name and the life of a soldier for me! I would not be living at ease and at play; True honor and glory I'd win in my day.  2.  A soldier! a soldier! in armor arrayed; My weapons in hand, of no contest afraid; I'd ever be ready to strike the first blow, And to fight my way through the ranks of the foe.  3.  But then, let me tell you, no blood would I shed, No victory seek o'er the dying and dead; A far braver soldier than this would I be; A warrior of Truth, in the ranks of the free.  4.  A soldier! a soldier! Oh, then, let me be! My friends, I invite you, enlist now with me. Truth's bands shall be mustered, love's foes shall give way! Let's up, and be clad in our battle array! J. G. Adams.   THIRD READER.  83  LESSON XXXIII.    THE ECHO. 1. As Robert was one day rambling about, he happened to cry out, \"Ho, ho!\" He instantly heard coming back from a hill near by, the same words, \"Ho, ho!\" 2. In great surprise, he said with a loud voice, \"Who are you?\" Upon this, the same words came back, \"Who are you?\" 3. Robert now cried out harshly, \"You must be a very foolish fellow.\"  \"Foolish fellow!\" came back from the hill. 4. Robert became angry, and with loud and fierce words went toward the spot whence the sounds came. The words all came back to him in the same angry tone. 5. He then went into the thicket, and looked for the boy who, as he thought, was mocking him; but he could find nobody anywhere. 6. When he went home, he told his mothe  84  ECLECTIC SERIES.    that some boy had hid himself in the wood, for the purpose of mocking him. 7. \"Robert,\" said his mother, \"you are angry with yourself alone. You heard nothing but your own words.\" 8. \"Why, mother, how can that be?\" said Robert. \"Did you never hear an echo?\" asked his mother. \"An echo, dear mother? No, ma'am. What is it?\" 9. \"I will tell you,\" said his mother. \"You know, when you play with your ball,   THIRD READER.  85 and throw it against the side of a house, it bounds back to you.\" \"Yes, mother,\" said he, \"and I catch it again.\" 10. \"Well,\" said his mother, \"if I were in the open air, by the side of a hill or a large barn, and should speak very loud, my voice would be sent back, so that I could hear again the very words which I spoke. 11. \"That, my son, is an echo. When you thought some one was mocking you, it was only the hill before you, echoing, or sending back, your own voice. 12. \"The bad boy, as you thought it was, spoke no more angrily than yourself. If you had spoken kindly, you would have heard a kind reply. 13. \"Had you spoken in a low, sweet, gentle tone, the voice that came back would have been as low, sweet, and gentle as your own. 14. \"The Bible says, 'A soft answer turneth away wrath.' Remember this when you are at play with your school mates. 15. \"If any of them should be offended, and speak in a loud, angry tone, remember the echo, and let your words be soft and kind.\"  86  ECLECTIC SERIES. 16. \"When you come home from school, and find your little brother cross and peevish, speak mildly to him. You will soon see a smile on his lips, and find that his tones will become mild and sweet. 17. \"Whether you are in the fields or in the woods, at school or at play, at home or abroad, remember, The good and the kind, By kindness their love ever"]]]
