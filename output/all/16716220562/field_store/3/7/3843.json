It's lucky all these people are used to the forest.\"  Just as the first rim of the sun appeared they were ready. There were six wagons, drawn by stout horses, in which they put the spare ammunition and their most valuable possessions. Everybody but the drivers walked, the women and children in the center of the column, the best of the scouts and skirmishers in the woods on the flanks. Then at the command of Colden the whole column moved into the forest, but Tayoga, Willet and a half dozen others ran about from house to house, setting them on fire with great torches, making fifty blazes which grew rapidly, because the timbers were now dry, uniting soon into one vast conflagration.  Robert and Colden, from the edge of the forest, watched the destruction of Fort Refuge. They saw the solid log structures fall in, sending up great masses of sparks as the burning timbers crashed together. They saw the strong blockhouse go, and then they saw the palisade itself flaming. Colden turned away with a sigh.  \"It's almost like burning your own manor house which you built yourself, and in which you expected to spend the remainder of your life,\" he said. \"It hurts all the more, too, because it's a sign that we've lost the border.\"  \"But we'll come back,\" said Robert, who had the will to be cheerful.  \"Aye, so we will,\" said Colden, brightening. \"We'll sweep back these French and Indians, and we'll come here and rebuild Fort Refuge on this very spot. I'll see to it, myself. This _is_ a splendid place for a fort, isn't it, Lennox?\"  \"So it is,\" replied Robert, smiling, \"and I've no doubt, Colden, that you'll supervise the rebuilding of Fort Refuge.\"  And in time, though the interval was great, it did come to pass.  Colden was not one to be gloomy long, and there was too much work ahead for one to be morbid. Willet had spoken of the precious six hours and they were, in, truth, more precious than diamonds. The flight was pushed to the utmost, the old people or the little children who grew weary were put in the wagons, and the speed they made was amazing for the wilderness. Robert remained well in the rear with Tayoga, Willet and Black Rifle, and they continually watched the forest for the first appearance of the Indian pursuit. That, in time, it would appear they never doubted, and it was their plan to give the vanguard of the warriors such a hot reception that they would hesitate. Besides the hundred fighting men, including the soldiers and boys large enough to handle arms, there were about a hundred women and children. Colden marched with the main column, and Wilton and Carson were at the rear. Black Rifle presently went ahead to watch lest they walk into an ambush, while Tayoga, Robert and Willet remained behind, the point from which the greatest danger was apprehended.  \"Isn't it likely,\" asked Robert, \"that the Indians will see the light of the burning fort, and that it will cause them to hasten?\"  \"More probably it will set them to wondering,\" replied the hunter, \"and they may hesitate. They may think a strong force has come to rescue the garrison and people.\"  \"But whatever Tandakora and the officer of Onontio may surmise,\" said Tayoga, \"our own course is plain, and that is to march as fast as we can.\"  \"And hope that a body of Colonial troops and perhaps the Mohawks will come to help us,\" said Willet. \"Colonel William Johnson, as we all know, is alert and vigorous, and it would be like him to push westward for the protection of settlers and refugees. 'Twould be great luck, Tayoga, if that bold young friend of yours, Daganoweda, the Mohawk chief, should be in this region.\"  \"It is not probable,\" said the Onondaga. \"The Keepers of the Eastern Gate are likely to remain in their own territory. They would not, without a strong motive, cross the lands of the other nations of the Hodenosaunee, but it is not impossible. They may have such a motive.\"  \"Then let us hope that it exists!\" exclaimed Robert fervently. \"The sight of Daganoweda and a hundred of his brave Mohawks would lift a mighty load from my mind.\"  Tayoga smiled. A compliment to the Mohawks was a compliment to the entire Hodenosaunee, and therefore to the Onondagas as well. Moreover the fame and good name of the Mohawks meant almost as much to him as the fame and good name of the Onondagas.  \"The coming of Daganoweda would be like the coming of light itself,\" he said.  They were joined by Wilton, who, as Robert saw, had become a fine forest soldier, alert, understanding and not conceited because of his knowledge. Robert noted the keen, wary look of this young man of Quaker blood, and he felt sure that in the event of an attack he would be among the very best of the defenders.  \"The spirit of battle, bursting at last in you, Will, from its long confinement, is likely to have full chance for gratification,\" he said.  \"So it will, Lennox, and I tremble to think of what that released spirit may do. If I achieve any deed of daring and valor bear in mind that it's not me, but the escaped spirit of previous ages taking violent and reckless charge of my weak and unwilling flesh.\"  \"Suppose we form a curtain behind our retreating caravan,\" said Robert. \"A small but picked force could keep back the warriors a long time, and permit our main column to continue its flight unhampered.\"  \"A good idea! an idea most excellent!\" exclaimed Willet.  As a matter of form, the three being entirely independent in their movements, the suggestion was made to Colden, and he agreed at once and with thorough approval. Thirty men, including Willet, Robert, Tayoga and Wilton, were chosen as a fighting rear guard, and the hunter himself took command of it. Spreading out in a rather long line to prevent being flanked, they dropped back and let the train pass out of sight on its eastern flight.  They were now about ten miles from the burned fort, and, evidences of pursuit not yet being visible, Robert became hopeful that the caution of Tandakora and De Courcelles would hold them back a long time. He and Tayoga kept together, but the thirty were stretched over a distance of several hundred yards, and now they retreated very slowly, watching continually for the appearance of hostile warriors.  \"They have, of course, a plain trail to follow,\" Robert said. \"One could not have a better trace than that made by wagon wheels. It's just a matter of choice with them whether they come fast or not.\"  \"I think we are not likely to see them before the night,\" said Tayoga. \"Knowing that the column has much strength, they will prefer the darkness and ambush.\"  \"But they're not likely to suspect the screen that we have thrown out to cover the retreat.\"  \"No, that is the surprise we have prepared for them. But even so, we, the screen, may not come into contact with them before the dark.\"  Tayoga's calculation was correct. The entire day passed while the rear guard retreated slowly, and all the aspects of the forest were peaceful. They saw no pursuing brown figures and they heard no war cry, nor the call of one band to another. Yet Robert felt that the night would bring a hostile appearance of some kind or other. Tandakora and De Courcelles when they came upon the site of the burned fort would not linger long there, but would soon pass on in eager pursuit, hoping to strike a fleeing multitude, disorganized by panic. But he smiled to himself at the thought that they would strike first against the curtain of fire and steel, that is, the thirty to whom he belonged.  When night came he and Tayoga were still together and Willet was a short distance away. He watched the last light of the sun die and then the dusk deepen, and he felt sure that the approach of the pursuing host could not be long delayed. His eyes continually searched the thickets and forest in front of them for a sight of the savage vanguard.  \"Can you see Tododaho upon his star?\" he asked Tayoga in all earnestness.  \"The star is yet faint in the heavens,\" replied the Onondaga, \"and I can only trace across its face the mists and vapors which are the snakes in the hair of the great chieftain, but Tododaho will not desert us. We, his children, the Onondagas, have done no harm, and I, Tayoga, am one of them. I feel that all the omens and presages are favorable.\"  The reply of the Onondaga gave Robert new strength. He had the deepest respect for the religion of the Hodenosaunee, which he felt was so closely akin to his own, and Tododaho was scarcely less real to him than to Tayoga. His veins thrilled with confidence that they would drive back, or at least hold Tandakora and De Courcelles, if they came.  The last and least doubt that they would come was dispelled within an hour when Tayoga suddenly put a hand upon his arm, and, in a whisper, told him to watch a bush not more than a hundred yards away.  \"A warrior is in the thicket,\" he said. \"I would not have seen him as he crept forward had not a darker shadow appeared upon the shadow of the night. But he is there, awaiting a chance to steal upon us and fire.\"  \"And others are near, seeking the same opportunity.\"  \"It is so, Dagaeoga. The attack will soon begin.\"  \"Shall we warn Willet?\"  \"The Great Bear has seen already. His eyes pierce the dark and they have noted the warrior, and the other warriors. Lie down, Dagaeoga, the first warrior is going to fire.\"  Robert sank almost flat. There was a report in the bush, a flash of fire, and a bullet whistled high over their heads. From a point on their right came an answering report and flash, and the warrior in the bush uttered his death cry. Robert, who was watching him, saw him throw up his hands and fall.

His brown eyes looked with loving good-will at everything and everybody.  Jan and his brother, Rollo, had great fun playing together, his long fur making it easy for Rollo to haul him around, while Jan's teeth slipped from his brother's short hair. Though they tumbled about and growled fiercely at each other, their eyes were dancing with laughter.  When tired of playing, they would coax their mother to tell them stories about the Hospice dogs. Then they would lie very quietly listening with pricked-up ears and earnest eyes. Sometimes Bruno, the oldest dog in the kennels, would join in the talk, and all the young dogs would gather around to hear the history of their family. Prince Jan and Rollo, cuddled beside their mother, would look at each other with pride, remembering that they, too, were St. Bernards.  \"I have heard the monks tell visitors that our ancestors have lived in the Hospice for a thousand years,\" said Bruno in one of his talks. \"When you puppies are old enough, you will be trained for work. The duty of a St. Bernard dog is to save lives and be worthy of his ancestors.\"  Jan and Rollo looked at him and thumped their tails to show that they understood.  \"A good St. Bernard dog must have a sensitive nose, sturdy legs, and keen brains,\" Bruno's voice was very sober. \"He knows what he must do when he finds a human being lost in the storm or frozen in the snow. Then he leads the way to the Hospice, or if the traveller does not follow, the dog brings monks to aid the man. Should one of us ever fail to do his best,\" he turned his big head slowly and his eyes were serious as he looked at the puppies, \"it would mean disgrace for all the rest of the St. Bernard dogs.\"  \"Tell us more stories, Bruno,\" the youngsters begged.  \"Not to-day,\" Bruno shook his wise head. \"Your ancestors have done great things, and you have the right to be proud of them, but the only way to prove yourselves worthy is for you to do your duty as well as they did theirs. Unless you remember your lessons and follow them, you will not be true St. Bernards, and your failures will be stains on the honor of the name we bear. Never forget that as long as you live!\"  Bruno understood that the soft little whimpers were promises that each puppy would do his best when the test came to him. Jan and Rollo watched the old dog, limping from rheumatism in his shoulders, move slowly across the enclosed yard that opened from the kennels. Bruno was no longer able to go out on the trails, but spent his days teaching the young dogs. Sometimes he would lie asleep, and when his paws jerked and his tail moved, Jan's mother would say, \"Be quiet, children! Bruno is dreaming he is out on the trail.\"  Then she would speak softly, \"When you are older you will be taught to break trails through the snow and carry food and wine, fastened about your necks. You may be tempted, when the wind howls and the snow blinds you, to sneak back or hide in a sheltered place. You must not forget, as long as you live, that there was never a traitor or coward in your father's family or in mine. When you remember this, you will stagger on or crawl, if you cannot stand, and keep your nose close to the ground, sniffing and sniffing.\"  She turned her head toward the white peaks that loomed high above the stone walls around the enclosure. \"Only a St. Bernard can tell whether the snow which has drifted during the night is strong enough to bear the weight of a man, or whether that man would sink beyond rescuing.\"  Jan and his brother waited respectfully when she stopped speaking and stared at the mountain-tops, until she said, \"Sometimes, you will find an ice-bridge. Then you must go very carefully. If it creaks beneath your weight, never let any human being step on it, even if you must fight him back. Your father, Rex, died when an ice-bridge broke through; but he saved four men from death. Always remember one thing. To die doing one's duty is the greatest honor that can come to a St. Bernard.\"  The two puppies whined softly and their mother knew that each of her children was promising that he would do his best to be worthy of such a father.  \"Ah,\" said Prince Jan to his brother, as their mother crossed the yard toward the kennel, \"some day we, too, will go out and do our work. Won't that be glorious, Rollo?\"  In their happiness they raced to their mother, who watched them with loving, proud eyes. When they reached her side Jan measured himself to see how much bigger he must grow, for though he was large for his age, he was only six months old.  \"Oh, if I could only grow faster, mother!\" he cried.  \"Be patient, Jan,\" she answered, biting his ear gently. \"Your time is coming soon!\"  \"My time is coming! My time is coming!\" Jan leaped and barked in glee.  \"Mine, too!\" called Rollo. \"We'll work together, Jan!\"  The big door leading from the enclosure where the dogs romped and played swung open, and two men who came out, stood looking at the dogs. The puppies watched eagerly, for these men had charge of the youngsters. All the dogs knew them, and even if the men had been strangers the Hospice dogs would have known they were monks who belonged to the Hospice, for the clothes they wore were different from the clothes of other men who came to the Hospice for a day or two.  A long, black, close-fitting coat reached almost to the feet of each monk, a peaked hood hung between his shoulders and a little round, black, skull-cap was on his head. All of the monks dressed the same way, and when it was cold and they went out on the trail, they took off the little cap and pulled the peaked hood over their heads and around their ears.  The dogs hurried to the monks and one of the men leaned down and felt Jan's legs and back. Prince Jan looked anxiously into the two kindly faces. He had seen them do the same thing with other puppies, and afterwards many of his playmates went away and never returned. At first he and Rollo thought they had died on the trail, like their ancestors; but Jan's mother shook her head sadly and said, \"They were not strong enough to do the work.\"  Now he remembered this and wondered if he would be sent away. His little legs and back stiffened so that the monks would see how strong he was.  \"I believe this will be one of the best dogs we have had since Barry's time,\" said Brother Antoine, running his hand along Jan's back. \"He has wonderful muscles and a very strong back. We will take him out and give him a trial to-morrow.\"  Jan licked the hand that rested on his head, then he dashed to his mother's side, yelping with excitement and panting out the good news.  She looked with pride into his happy eyes and said, \"You are going to be just like your father! He was a descendant of Barry, the bravest dog of us all. You will be a credit to your ancestors!\"  \"I will do the very best I can,\" promised little Prince Jan. Then he lay down and wrinkled his soft forehead as he tried to remember everything that Bruno and his mother had taught him, so that he would be ready for his first lesson.  The next morning he was wide awake before any of the other dogs. They all slept in a big basement under the Hospice building. Jan could see the arched corridors that reached along the big room with its floor of grey stone. The cows of the Hospice were kept in the basement, too, for there was never any green grass outside for them to graze upon. Here and there curled dogs that Prince Jan knew. Jupitiére, Junon, Mars, Vulcan, Pluton, Leon, and Bruno were not far away from him.  At last the door leading to the yard was opened and the dogs raced and tumbled out, looking like great, tawny lions and cubs rushing from stone cages. They ate a breakfast of boiled rice that"]]]
