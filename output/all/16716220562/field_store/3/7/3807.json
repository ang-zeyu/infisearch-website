Such a League may, probably must, come into existence, and its aims and methods be formulated, before Germany and her Allies could be admitted to it; but as soon as Germany and her Allies can give adequate assurances that they will adopt and be bound by the principles laid down as the foundation of the League, they should be admitted to it. Until this is possible the League must partake of the nature of a defensive alliance rather than of a world-wide league of peace.  7.--Whether any definite sanction for enforcing the principles on which the League is founded and the stipulations which it contains can be imposed or not, the League may be of great value by giving the weight of international opinion expressly to those principles. Public opinion of the nations so expressed might often be effective even though not enforced by a definite sanction.  8.--Of the two definite sanctions proposed, namely, (_a_) the so-called \"economic boycott\" and (_b_) the use of the naval and military forces of the leagued States or of certain States selected from them by arrangement, the economic boycott which can readily be applied by all members of the League alike, and that without keeping up any large armaments, is likely to be effective and is free from the most serious objections against the other sanction suggested.  9.--So many difficulties would arise in fixing the terms of any stipulations as to the employment of military and naval forces to carry into effect the requirements of the League, that to make such provisions a necessary preliminary condition to the existence of the League from the outset might indefinitely delay the formation of such a League, and, further, the discussion of such terms would be likely to lead to friction. The obligation imposed on certain States might involve a very heavy burden, first, in keeping up armaments and possibly, later, in actually going to war. Such stipulations, for reasons above stated and illustrated, might place the leading powers in a position of great embarrassment, and might actually themselves become the cause of serious wars.  10.--The practice of making Secret Treaties by which the Sovereigns, the Foreign Ministers, or the diplomatists of any nation can bind it ought to be discontinued. The experience of the action of this country as well as of others during the present War, as well as before it, supports this conclusion. Negotiations must no doubt be carried on through the ordinary diplomatic channels, but before a complete and binding agreement is entered into, the duly constituted representatives of the popular will should know and give their sanction to what is being done. On the other hand, for unauthorised persons or any self-constituted bodies or conferences to attempt to pre-judge such questions and to carry on negotiations either with regular or irregular representatives of other nations is pernicious. Such action is likely both to lead to confusion and to hamper the action of the authorised representatives of the nation, and is really opposed to sound principles of democracy, which must be based on the duly expressed will of the nation as a whole, and not of any section.  11.--Much may be done in settling the terms of peace after the War by acting so as to remove probable causes of war in the future. The adoption of some of the methods used in the past, as, for example, at the Congress at Vienna, is sure to lead to future difficulties. Terms of peace should not be matters for the kind of bargaining between the powerful States by which one gives up something in consideration of another giving up something else in exchange, and the contracting parties treat smaller States or weaker nations as \"pawns\" in the game. Each territory about which any question arises, each subject which has to be dealt with, should be treated independently in accordance with the requirements of justice, and especially having regard to the welfare of the people most directly affected by it. No claim, for example, on the part of Germany to be compensated for evacuating and making reparation to Belgium by having some advantage in some other part of the world should be entertained for a moment. To do so would be equivalent to bargaining with a criminal as to the compensation to be paid to him for giving up what he has acquired by his crimes. It is, however, legitimate in considering the question of self-determination by the people of any territory to consider how far such people have established or can establish a peaceful and orderly government, and how far the arrangements to be made as regards any country or district will affect the safety of contiguous countries or may give rise to future disputes and really be productive of war.  12.--Whether a League is established or not, treaties for submitting disputes to arbitration, and if possible to tribunals permanently constituted, will still be valuable in the future as in the past. The decisions of regular tribunals composed of impartial persons who inspire respect will gradually form a body of customary law, and be precedents guiding action in the future. The attempt of Germany to override not only precedents but also express agreements with regard to the conduct of war, if it fails, does not discredit the value of such attempts as were made at The Hague to embody in definite form the international law on the subjects with which they endeavoured to deal. A careful revision of the provisions agreed to at The Hague in light of subsequent knowledge is desirable. They only become a dead letter if one nation utterly disregards them and does so without incurring a penalty in some form.  13.--It is not desirable to attempt to go into exact detail in all the arrangements so made. For example, the attempt to enumerate a list of articles which are to be deemed contraband, as was tried in the Declaration of London, has led to preposterous results. Articles which at one time were of no use in war have become, through the advance in scientific knowledge, the material for making the most deadly and most cruel instruments in the course of the present War.  14.--An attempt must be made to secure at least partial disarmament. Provision as to the disarmament of Germany should be one of the terms of peace. The extent and character of any arrangements as to general disarmament require separate and detailed consideration. It would naturally be one of the subjects to be discussed by any League which may be formed. It is well to note from the outset (a) that a fleet is essential to the British Empire for purely defensive purposes, and for maintaining connection between the different parts of the Empire, but a great reduction in the size of the fleet may be possible by arrangement. The Allied Powers will recognise that it was the existence of the British fleet that saved them from defeat, and in some cases from utter destruction. (6) That for a nation to train its citizens as a defensive force on the Swiss model may actually tend to preserve peace, and also have a very useful influence on the morale of a nation. A defensive force of this kind would not have the character or the aims which make a great professional army a menace to peace.  15.--Lastly, it is undesirable and would be futile to attempt to set up a \"supernational sovereign authority.\" The scope of any League--its powers and its objects--should be clearly defined, and the independent sovereign States should bind themselves, as contracting parties, to carry out the terms agreed, and all should agree beforehand as to the steps they would take to prevent or to punish any violation of those terms.

A few still perhaps remain of those who, as under-graduates at the time of the Franco-German War, remember Dean Stanley's first sermons after many years of exclusion from the Oxford University pulpit. Using in one of them his favourite plan of giving life to ancient literature by modern illustrations and conversely making modern tendencies clearer by references to ancient thought, he took the words of the Hebrew prophet, applying them to the troubles and strife of the time. \"Who is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14872"],["title","The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (#0)"],["body","Team.        THE TALE OF SQUIRREL NUTKIN  BY BEATRIX POTTER  _Author of_ \"_The Tale of Peter Rabbit_\"  [Illustration]  FREDERICK WARNE  [Illustration]  FREDERICK WARNE     1903 by Frederick Warne & Co.  Printed and bound in Great Britain by William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London     A STORY FOR NORAH  [Illustration]  This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.  He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.  [Illustration]  In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.  [Illustration]  One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.  [Illustration]  They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.  Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.  [Illustration]  They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  \"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?\"  [Illustration]  But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red _cherry_, singing--      \"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      A little wee man, in a red red coat!      A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.\"  Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.  He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.  [Illustration]  The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.  [Illustration]  But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--  \"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?\"  [Illustration]  But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a _nettle_ and singing--      \"Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!      Hitty Pitty within the wall,      Hitty Pitty without the wall;      If you touch Hitty Pitty,      Hitty Pitty will bite you!\"  Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.  [Illustration]  He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue _smoke_ from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      \"A house full, a hole full!      And you cannot gather a bowl-full!\"    [Illustration]  The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  But Nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.  [Illustration]  On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.  They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.  [Illustration]  Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing--      \"The man in the wilderness said to me,     'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'      I answered him as I thought good--      'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'\"  But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.  [Illustration]  On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in _plum-pudding_ for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       \"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree       Flour of England, fruit of Spain,       Met together in a shower of rain;       Put in a bag tied round with a string,     If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!\"   Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.  [Illustration]  The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.  [Illustration]  On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble _bees'_ nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      \"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!       As I went over Tipple-tine       I met a flock of bonny swine;     Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       They were the very bonniest swine       That e'er went over Tipple-tine.\"  [Illustration]  Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.  But he ate up the honey!  [Illustration]  The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.  [Illustration]  On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid _egg_ in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.  But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      \"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,      With a white counterpane round his neck,      Forty doctors and forty wrights,      Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!\"  [Illustration]  Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.  [Illustration]  Nutkin became more and more impertinent--        \"Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!     Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;     All the King's horses, and all the King's men,     Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,     Off the King's kitchen door.\"  Nutkin danced up and down like a _sunbeam_; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.  [Illustration]  Nutkin began again--      \"Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,      He comes roaring up the land!      The King of Scots with all his power,      Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!\"  Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the _wind_, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!...  Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud \"Squeak!\"  The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.  [Illustration]  When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.         *       *       *       *       *  _But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!_  [Illustration]  This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.  [Illustration]  Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.  [Illustration]  And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  \"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!\""]]]
