He's not wasting any time, that's sure.\"  He took the deck. Ten minutes later Lieutenant Hetherton reported to him, saluting at the same time.  \"Engineer says he'll have steam up in two hours, sir.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Frank, returning the salute. \"Will you kindly take the deck, Lieutenant Hetherton? I'm going below.\"  Lieutenant Hetherton took the deck, and thus relieved, Frank went below and sought out Jack's cabin.  \"Now,\" he said, \"I'll find out what all this rush is about.\"  Without the formality of a knock, he went in.     CHAPTER IV  THE START   Inside Jack's cabin, Frank found his commander and chum engaged in conversation with the engineer officer, who had sought his new commander immediately after giving instructions below. He saluted Frank as the lad entered.  \"My first officer, Lieutenant Chadwick, Mr. Winslow,\" Jack introduced them. \"I am sure you will get along together.\"  \"So am I, sir,\" agreed the engineer. \"And when shall we be moving, sir?\"  \"I can't say, exactly,\" replied Jack. \"Probably not before morning, but I wish to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said the engineer, \"As I said before, I'll have steam up in two hours.\"  \"Do so, sir.\"  The engineer saluted and left Jack's cabin.  Jack turned to Frank.  \"Now,\" he said, \"what are you doing here? I thought I left you to take the deck?\"  \"I turned the deck over to Hetherton,\" replied Frank with a grin. \"I wanted to find out what all this rush is about?\"  \"Don't you know it's bad form to ask questions of your commander?\" Jack said severely.  \"Maybe it is,\" Frank agreed, \"but I just wanted to find out.\"  \"Well, I wouldn't do it in front of any of the other officers or the men,\" said Jack. \"It's bad for the ship's discipline. However, I'll tell you, I just wanted to have things ready, that's all. Come, we'll go on deck.\"  They ascended to the bridge. Jack addressed Lieutenant Hetherton.  \"Pipe all hands on deck for inspection, Lieutenant,\" he ordered.  Lieutenant Hetherton passed the word. A moment later men came tumbling up the companion way and fell into line aft. Jack and Frank walked forward to look them over. Jack addressed a few words to the men.  \"I've just taken over command of the Brigadier,\" he said. \"To-morrow morning, or sooner, we shall sail, our destination temporarily to be known only to myself. I believe that I may safely promise you some action before many days have passed.\"  A hearty British cheer swept the ship.  \"Hurrah!\" cried the men.  A few moments later Jack dismissed them. Then the officers returned to the bridge, where Jack told off the watches.  \"Now,\" he said, \"I'll have to look over the ship.\"  Frank accompanied him on his tour of inspection. They found everything absolutely clean and ship-shape. The muzzles of the big guns were shining brightly beneath their coat of polish. After the inspection, Jack and Frank went below for a look at the ship's papers.  The Brigadier was a small destroyer, not more than 200 feet long. It had a complement of 250 men, officers and crew; carried two batteries of 9-inch guns in turrets forward and aft and was equipped with three 2-inch torpedo tubes. It was not one of the latest of British destroyers, but still it was modern in many respects.  \"A good ship,\" said Jack, after a careful examination of the papers. \"As to speed, we should get twenty-three knots on a pinch. Her fighting equipment is excellent, everything is spick and span, and I was impressed with the officers and crew. Yes, she is a good ship.\"  \"And you're the boss of the whole ranch, Jack,\" said Frank. \"Think of it. Less than four years ago you knew nothing at all of naval tactics, and now you're in command of a British destroyer. By George! I wouldn't mind having your job myself.\"  Jack smiled.  \"Never mind,\" he said. \"You'll get yours some day. I've just been more fortunate, that's all. Besides, I knew something of navigation before you did, and while you have mastered it now, I had a long start.\"  \"That's true enough,\" Frank admitted, \"but at the same time you are considerably more fit for the job than I am. Another thing. I don't know that I would trade my berth here for a command of a ship.\"  Jack looked his surprise.  \"Why?\" he asked.  \"Because it would separate us,\" was Frank's reply. \"We've been together now since the war began, almost. I hope that we may see it through together.\"  \"Here, too,\" declared the commander of the Brigadier, \"but at the same time you should not let a matter of friendship stand between you and what may be your big opportunity.\"  \"Oh, I'd probably take the job if it were offered me,\" said Frank. \"I'm just hoping the offer will not be made; that's all.\"  The lads conversed for some moments longer. Then Frank looked at his watch.  \"My watch,\" he said quietly. \"I'll be going on deck.\"  \"Right,\" said Jack. \"Call me if anything happens.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Frank, saluting his commander gravely.  Jack grinned.  \"By Jove! It seems funny to have you talk like that to me,\" he said. \"At the same time I suppose it must be done for the sake of discipline. However, it is not necessary in private.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Frank, \"I had better stick to it or I'm liable to forget in public some time.\"  \"Well, maybe you're right,\" said Jack.  Frank turned on his heel and went on deck, where he relieved Lieutenant Hetherton, who had been on watch.  \"Nothing to report, sir,\" said Lieutenant Hetherton, saluting.  \"Very well, sir,\" was Frank's reply, as he, too, saluted.  It was after midnight, and Frank's watch was nearing its end when the lookout on the port side called:  \"Boat off the port bow, sir.\"  Frank advanced to the rail. A moment later there was a hail from the water.  \"What ship is that?'  \"His Majesty's Ship Brigadier,\" Frank called back.  \"I'm coming aboard you,\" said the voice from the darkness. \"Lower a ladder.\"  Frank gave the necessary command. A few moments later a man attired in the uniform of a British captain came over the side. He approached Frank, who was barely visible in the darkness.  \"Captain Templeton?\" he asked.  \"No, sir. I'm Lieutenant Chadwick. A moment, sir, and I'll call the captain.\"  \"If you please,\" said the visitor.  Frank passed the word for the quartermaster, who arrived within a few moments.  \"Call Captain Templeton,\" Frank directed.  Jack arrived on deck a few moments later and exchanged greetings with his visitor. The latter produced a packet of papers.  \"From the admiralty,\" he said. \"You will know what to do with them.\"  Jack took the papers and stowed them in his pocket.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said.  \"That is all, then,\" said the visitor. \"I shall be going.\"  He stepped to the side of the vessel and disappeared.  \"This means,\" said Jack, after the other had gone, \"that we can sail any time now.\"  \"Then why not at once?\" asked Frank.  \"You anticipated me,\" replied Jack. \"Will you kindly pipe all hands on deck, Mr. Chadwick?\"  Frank passed the word.  Sleepy men came tumbling from their bunks below. All became bustle and hurry aboard the Brigadier. Jack himself took the bridge. Frank stood beside him. Other officers took their places.  \"Man the guns!\" came Jack's order.  It was the lad's intention to overlook nothing that would protect the ship should it encounter an enemy submarine en route, and, as the lad knew, it was just as possible they would encounter one in the English Channel as elsewhere.  For, despite all precautions taken by British naval authorities, enemy submarines more than once had crept through the channel, once penetrating Dover harbor itself, where they had wreaked considerable damage before being driven away by British destroyers and submarine chasers.  A few moments later Jack signaled the engine room.  \"Half speed ahead.\"  Slowly the Brigadier slipped from her anchorage and moved through the still waters of the harbor. Directly she pushed her nose into the channel, then headed east.  \"Full speed ahead!\" Jack signaled the engine room.  The Brigadier leaped forward.  \"Better turn in, Jack,\" said Frank. \"It's Thompson's watch.\"  \"No, I'll stick until we reach the Atlantic,\" returned Jack.  \"Then I'll stick along,\" said Frank.  This they did.  It was hours later when the Brigadier ran clear of the channel and breasted the heavy swell of the Atlantic. Jack spoke to Thompson, the third officer.  \"I'm going to turn in,\" he said. \"If anything happens, call me at once.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" was the third officer's reply.  He saluted briefly. Jack and Frank went below.  \"Come in a moment before you turn in, if you wish,\" Jack said to Frank.  \"May as well,\" replied the latter. \"I don't feel like turning in for an hour yet.\"  \"Well, you can't keep me out of bed that long,\" declared Jack. \"I've got to be stirring before you go on watch again. But I thought we might talk a few moments.\"  Nevertheless, it was an hour later that Frank went to his own cabin. He turned in at once and was soon fast asleep.  On the other hand, sleep did not come to Jack so soon. For an hour or more he lay in his bunk, reviewing the events of the past and his responsibilities of the present.  \"It's a big job I have now,\" he told himself. \"I hope I can carry it through successfully.\"  But he didn't have the slightest doubt that he could. Jack's one best characteristic was absolute confidence in himself.     CHAPTER V  A RESCUE   H.M.S. Brigadier was steaming steadily along at a speed of twenty knots. Jack himself held the bridge. Frank and Lieutenant Hetherton, who stood nearby, were discussing the sinking several days before of a large allied transport by a German submarine in the Irish sea.  \"She was sunk without warning, the same as usual,\" said Hetherton.  \"The Germans never give warning any more,\" replied Frank, \"Of course, the reason is obvious enough. To give warning it would be necessary for the submarine to come to the surface, in which case the merchant ship might"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14626"],["title","The Boy Allies with the Victorious Fleets; Or, The Fall of the German Navy (#4)"],["body","able to place a shell aboard the U-Boat before she could submerge again. So to take time to give warning would be a disadvantage to the submarine.\"  \"At the same time,\" said Hetherton, \"it's an act of barbarism to sink a big ship without giving passengers and crew a word of warning.\"  \"Oh, I'm not defending the German system,\" declared Frank. \"I am just giving you what I believe is the German viewpoint.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Hetherton, \"it's about time such activities were stopped.\"  \"It certainly is. But it seems that the U-Boats are growing bolder each day.\"  \"It wouldn't surprise me,\" declared Lieutenant Hetherton, \"to hear almost any day that U-Boats had crossed the Atlantic to prey on shipping in American waters.\"  Frank looked at the second officer sharply. He was sure that Jack had not divulged the real reason for their present voyage, and he had said nothing about the matter himself.  \"Just a chance remark, I guess,\" Frank told himself. Aloud he said: \"I hardly think it will come to that.\"  \"I hope not,\" replied Hetherton, \"but you never can tell, you know.\"  \"That's true enough, too,\" Frank agreed, \"but at the same--\"  He broke off suddenly as he caught the sharp hail of the forward lookout.  \"Ship in distress off the port bow, sir,\" came the cry.  Jack was at once called to the deck.  Instantly Frank and Lieutenant Hetherton sprang to Jack's side. At almost the same moment the radio operator emerged from below on the run.  \"Message, sir,\" he exclaimed, and thrust a piece of paper in Jack's hand. Jack read it quickly. It ran like this:  \"Merchant steamer Hazelton, eight thousand tons, New York to Liverpool with munitions and supplies, torpedoed by submarine. Sinking. Help.\"  \"Did you get her position?\" demanded Jack of the wireless operator.  \"No, sir. The wireless failed before he could give it.\"  \"Don't you think it may be the vessel ahead, sir?\" asked Lieutenant Hetherton.  \"Can't tell,\" was Jack's reply. \"It may be, in which case there are probably more submarines about. Clear ship for action, Mr. Chadwick.\"  No sooner said than done.  Frank and others of the ship's officers darted hither and yon, making sure that everything was in readiness. At the guns, the gunners grinned cheerfully. Frank approached the battery in the forward turret.  \"All right?\" he asked.  \"O.K., sir,\" replied the officer in command of the gun crew. \"Show us a submarine, that's all we ask.\"  \"There are probably a dozen or so about here some place,\" returned Frank. \"Keep your eyes peeled and don't wait an order to fire if you see anything that looks like one.\"  \"Right, sir.\"  The officer turned to his men with a sharp command.  Frank continued his inspection of the ship as the Brigadier dashed toward the vessel in distress, probably ten miles ahead.  Every man aboard the Brigadier was on the alert as the destroyer plowed swiftly through the water. It was possible, of course, that the submarines had made off after attacking the vessel, but there was always the possibility that some were still lurking in the neighborhood.  \"Can't be too careful,\" Jack told himself.  Fifteen minutes later, the lookout was able to make out more clearly the ship ahead of them.  \"Steamer Hazelton,\" he called to the quartermaster, who reported to Jack.  \"Same vessel that sent the wireless, Frank,\" was Jack's comment. \"We will have to look sharp. It's more than an even bet that some of those undersea sharks are watching for a ship to come to the rescue so they can have a shot at her also.\"  \"We're ready for 'em,\" said Frank significantly.  \"All right,\" said Jack. \"In the meantime we'll stand by the Hazelton and see if we can lend a hand.\"  As the Brigadier drew closer those on deck could see signs of confusion aboard the Hazelton. Then there arose a large cloud of smoke that for a moment hid the Hazelton from view. This was followed by a loud explosion.  When the smoke cleared away, the water nearby was filled with struggling figures.  \"Lower the boats,\" shouted Jack.  Instantly men sprang to obey the command, while others of the British tars still stood quietly behind their guns, their eyes scanning the sea.  Aboard the Hazelton, the crew, or what remained of the crew, were attempting to lower lifeboats. Directly one was lowered safely, and loaded to the guards with human freight. A second and a third were lowered safely, and put off toward the Brigadier.  In the meantime, lifeboats from the destroyer had darted in among the struggling figures and willing hands were lifting the victims to safety. Then these, in turn, started back to the destroyer.  \"I guess they're all off,\" said Frank to Jack.  \"I hope so,\" was Jack's reply. \"If I am not mistaken, there are women among the survivors.\"  \"By George! I thought I saw some myself,\" was Frank's answer.  Suddenly there was a crash as the forward turret guns aboard the Brigadier burst into action. Looking ahead, Jack gave a startled cry, and no wonder.  For, from beneath the water, appeared a periscope and then the long low outline of a German submarine came into view.  Again the Brigadier's guns crashed, but the shells did not strike home.  Before the destroyer could fire again, a gun appeared as if by magic on the submarine's deck, and a hail of bullets was poured into the first of the nearby lifeboats. At the same time the U-Boat launched a torpedo at the Brigadier.  Jack gave a cry of horror at the predicament of those in the small boats. But he did not lose his head, and at the same time maneuvered his ship out of the path of the torpedo.  Came a hail from the lookout aft.  \"Submarine off the stern, sir!\"  At the same moment the battery in the Brigadier's turret aft burst into action.  \"Forward with you, Mr. Chadwick,\" cried Jack, \"and see if you can't get better results there. The men seem to have lost their nerve.\"  Frank sprang forward. Jack's words were true. It appeared that the crew in the forward turret were so anxious to sink the first submarine that they had not taken time to find the range.  \"Cease firing!\" shouted Frank as he sprang into the turret.  The order was obeyed, but there came a grumble from the men at what they deemed such a strange command under the circumstances.  \"I thought you fellows were gunners,\" said Frank angrily. \"Smith, get the range.\"  Smith did so, and announced it a moment later.  \"Now,\" said Frank, \"get your aim, men.\"  No longer was there confusion in the forward turret. The guns were trained carefully.  \"Ready,\" cried Frank. \"Fire!\"  \"Crash!\"  A moment and there was a loud cheer from the crew. The German submarine seemed to leap high from the water, and then fell back in a dozen pieces.  Frank wasted no further time on the first submarine. Leaving the forward turret, he dashed aft to where other guns were firing on the second submarine. Meantime Jack, perfectly cool on the bridge, had maneuvered his vessel out of the way of several torpedoes from the second U-Boat. But, as he very well knew, this combat must be brought to a quick end or one of the torpedoes was likely to find its mark.  From the deck of the second submarine, a hail of fire from a machine gun was still being poured into the helpless lifeboats. What execution had been done Jack had no means of telling at the moment, but he knew there must have been some casualties.  \"The brutes!\" he muttered.  The duel between the submarine and the destroyer still raged. It appeared that the commander of the submarine was a capable officer, for he had succeeded in keeping his vessel from being struck by a shell from the Brigadier.  In the aft turret of the Brigadier the British tars were sweating and muttering imprecations at their inability to put a shell aboard the enemy.  \"Here,\" said Frank, \"let me get at that gun.\"  The crew stepped aside and the lad sighted the weapon himself. Then he fired.  Again a cheer arose aboard the Brigadier. Frank's shot had been successful. The shell struck the submersible squarely amidships, and carried away the periscope.  \"Fire!\" cried Frank, and the other guns broke into action.  Again there was a wild cheer.  The submarine began to settle a few moments later. Men emerged from below and sprang into the sea.  \"Lower a boat!\" cried Jack. \"I want a few of those fellows.\"  A boat was lowered instantly and strong hands pulled it toward the Germans floundering in the water.  By this time the lifeboats that had escaped the German fire came alongside the Brigadier and the occupants climbed aboard the destroyer. These were quickly fitted out with dry clothing. It developed that there had been three women passengers aboard the Hazelton and all of these had been saved. A dozen members of the crew, however, had been killed by the enemy in the lifeboats.  Jack assigned quarters to the victims as quickly as he was able, and then calling his officers about him, awaited the return of the boat which had gone after the Germans who had leaped into the sea.  \"If the act I have just seen is a sample of the German heart,\" Jack said, \"I never want another German within sight of me so long as I live.\"     CHAPTER VI  CHANGED ORDERS   As the Germans came aboard--ten of them--they were herded before Jack. They stood there sullenly, their eyes on the deck. One of them wore a heavily braided and imposing uniform. Jack addressed him.  \"You are the commander of that submarine?\" he questioned.  \"I was,\" answered the German.  \"You were, what?\" asked Jack sharply.  \"I was the commander.\"  \"You don't seem to catch my meaning,\" said Jack, taking a step forward. \"When you speak to me say 'sir.'\"  \"Then you shall say 'sir' to me,\" said the German.  \"Oh, no I won't,\" Jack declared. \"I never say sir to a murderer.\"  The German's eyes lighted angrily.  \"It would be well to be more careful of your words,\" he said.  \"Nevertheless,\" said Jack, \"I repeat them. You, are a murderer, and as such should be hanged at once. I'm not sure it is in my province to string you up, but I'm strongly tempted to do so and take the"]]]
