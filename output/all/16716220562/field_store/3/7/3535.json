Add a wineglassful of sherry or Madeira, or, if the use of wine be objected to, the juice of a hard lemon. Flavour the soup with a little cayenne pepper, and serve some egg forcemeat balls in it, about the size of small marbles.   MULLIGATAWNY SOUP.--Take four large onions, cut them up and fry them brown, with a little butter, in a frying-pan, with a carrot cut up into small pieces; add to this a quart of stock or water, and boil till the vegetables and onions are tender; then rub the whole through a wire sieve and add a brimming teaspoonful of Captain White's Curry Paste and a dessertspoonful of curry powder, previously mixed smooth in a little cold water; thicken the soup with a little brown roux. Some persons would consider this soup too hot; if so, less curry powder can be used or more water added. If you have no curry paste, cut up a sour apple and add it to the vegetables in the frying-pan. If you have no sour apples, a few green gooseberries are a very good substitute. Boiled rice should be served on a separate dish with this soup, and should not be boiled in the soup at starting.   ONION SOUP.--Cut up half a dozen onions and throw them for a few minutes into boiling water. This takes off the rankness. Drain off the onions, and chop them up and boil them till they are tender in some milk that has been seasoned with pepper and salt and a pinch of savoury herbs. Take a small quantity of celery, carrot and turnip, or carrot and turnip and a little bruised celery seed, and boil till they are tender in a very little water; rub through a wire sieve, and add the pulp to the soup. The soup can be thickened with white roux, ground rice, or one or two eggs beaten up. The soup must be added to the eggs gradually or they will curdle.   ONION SOUP, BROWN.--Take an onion, carrot, celery, and turnip, and let them boil till quite tender in some water or stock. In the meantime slice up half a dozen large onions and fry them brown in a little butter, in a frying-pan, taking care that the onions are browned and not burnt black; add the contents of the frying-pan to the vegetables and stock, and after it has boiled some time, till the onions are tender, rub the whole through a wire sieve, thicken with a little brown roux, adding, of course, pepper and salt to taste.   OX-TAIL SOUP, IMITATION.--Slice off the outside red part of two or three large carrots, and cut them up into small dice not bigger than a quarter of an inch square. Cut up also into similar size a young turnip, and the white, hard part of a head of celery. Fry these very gently in a little butter, taking care that the vegetables do not turn colour. Make some soup exactly in every respect similar to that described in Imitation Mock Turtle. Throw in these fried vegetables, and let the soup simmer gently by the side of the fire, in order for it to throw up its butter, which should be skimmed off. In flavouring the soup, add only half the quantity of wine or lemon juice that you would use were you making Mock Turtle.   PALESTINE SOUP.--(_See_ ARTICHOKE SOUP.)   PARSNIP SOUP.--Prepare half a dozen parsnips, and boil them with an onion and half a head of celery in some stock till they are quite tender. Then rub the whole through a wire sieve, boil it up again, and serve. Sufficient parsnips must be boiled to make the soup as thick as pea soup, so the quantity of stock must be regulated accordingly. This soup is generally rather sweet, owing to the parsnips, and an extra quantity of salt must be added in consequence, as well as pepper. In Belgium and Germany this sweetness is corrected by the addition of vinegar. This, of course, is a matter of taste.   PEAR SOUP.--Pare, core, and slice six or eight large pears. Put them into a stew-pan with a penny roll cut into thin slices, half a dozen cloves, and three pints of water. Let them simmer until they are quite tender, then pass them through a coarse sieve, and return the puree to the saucepan, with two ounces of sugar, the strained juice of a fresh lemon, and half a tumblerful of light wine. Let the soup boil five or ten minutes, when it will be ready for serving. Send some sponge-cake to table with this dish.   PEA SOUP, FROM SPLIT DRIED PEAS.--Take a pint of split peas and put them in soak overnight in some cold water, and throw away those that float, as this shows that there is a hole in them which would be mildewy. Take two onions, a carrot, a small head of celery, and boil them with the peas in from three pints to two quarts of water till they are tender. This will be from four to five hours. When the peas are old and stale even longer time should be allowed. Then rub the whole through a wire sieve, put the soup back into the saucepan, and stir it while you make it hot or it will burn. In ordinary cookery, pea soup is invariably made from some kind of greasy stock, more especially the water in which pickled pork has been boiled. In the present instance we have no kind of fat to counteract the natural dryness of the pea-flour. We must therefore add, before sending to table, two or three ounces of butter. It will be found best to dissolve the butter in the saucepan before adding the soup to be warmed up, as it is then much less likely to stick to the bottom of the saucepan and burn. Fried or toasted bread should be served with the soup separately, as well as dried and powdered mint. The general mistake people make is, they do not have sufficient mint.   PEA SOUP, FROM DRIED GREEN PEAS.--Proceed as in the above recipe in every respect, substituting dried green peas for ordinary yellow split peas. Colour the soup green by adding a large handful of spinach before it is rubbed through the wire sieve, or add a small quantity of spinach extract (vegetable colouring sold by grocers in bottles); dried mint and fried or toasted bread should be served with the soup, as with the other.   PEA SOUP, GREEN (FRESH).--Take half a peck of young peas, shell them, and throw the peas into cold water. Put all the shells into a quart or more of stock or water. Put in also a handful of spinach if possible, a few sprigs of parsley, a dozen fresh mint-leaves and half a dozen small, fresh, green onions. Boil these for an hour, or rather more, and then rub the whole through a wire sieve. You cannot rub all the shells through; but you will be able to rub a great part through, that which is left in the sieve being only strings. Now put on the soup to boil again, and as soon as it boils throw in the peas; as soon as these are tender--about twenty minutes--the soup is finished and can be sent to table. If the soup is thin, a little white roux can be added to thicken it; if of a bad colour, or if you could not get any spinach, add some spinach extract (vegetable colouring, sold by all grocers), only take care not to add too much, and make the soup look like green paint.  POTATO SOUP.--Potato soup is a very good method of using up the remains of cold boiled potatoes. Slice up a large onion and fry it, without letting it turn colour, with a little butter. Add a little water or stock to the frying-pan, and let the onion boil till it is tender. Boil a quart or more of milk separately with a couple of bay-leaves; rub the onion with the cold potatoes through a wire sieve and add it to the milk. You can moisten the potatoes in the sieve with the milk. When you have rubbed enough to make the soup thick enough, let it boil up and add to every quart a saltspoonful of thyme and a brimming teaspoonful of chopped blanched parsley. This soup should be rather thicker than most thick soups.  When new potatoes first come into season, and especially when you have new potatoes from your own garden, it will often be found that mixed with the ordinary ones there are many potatoes no bigger than a toy marble, and which are too small to be boiled and sent to table as an ordinary dish of new potatoes. Reserve all these little dwarf potatoes, wash them, and throw them for five or ten minutes into boiling water, drain them off and throw them into the potato soup whole. Of course they must boil in the soup till they are tender. A little cream is a great improvement to the soup, and dried mint can be served with it, but is not absolutely necessary.   PUMPKIN SOUP.--Take half or a quarter of a moderate-sized pumpkin, pare it, remove the seeds, and cut the pumpkin into thin slices. Put these into a stew-pan, with as much water or milk as will cover them, and boil gently until they are reduced to a pulp. Rub this through a fine sieve, mix with it a little salt, and a piece of butter the size of an egg, and stir it over the fire until it boils. Thin it with some boiling milk which has been sweetened and flavoured with lemon-rind, cinnamon, or orange-flower water. It should be of the consistency of thick cream. Put toasted bread, cut into the size of dice, at the bottom of the soup-tureen. Moisten the bread-dice with a small quantity of the liquor, let them soak a little while, then pour the rest of the soup over them, and serve very hot. Or whisk two fresh eggs thoroughly in the tureen, and pour the soup in over them at the last moment. The liquor ought to have ceased from boiling for a minute or two before it is poured over the eggs.   RHUBARB SOUP.--This is a sweet soup, and is simply juice from stewed rhubarb sweetened and flavoured with lemon-peel and added either to cream or beaten-up yolks of eggs and a little white wine. It is rarely met with in this country.   RICE SOUP.--Take a quarter of a pound of rice, and wash it in several waters till the water ceases to be discoloured. Take an onion, the white part of a head of celery, and a turnip, and cut them up and fry them in a little butter. Add a quart of stock, or water, and boil these vegetables until they are tender, and then rub them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14595"],["title","The Soldier Boy; or, Tom Somers in the Army: A Story of the Great Rebellion (#0)"],["body","Team.

NEW YORK HURST & COMPANY PUBLISHERS     TO  William Lee, Esq.  THIS BOOK  IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  BY HIS FRIEND  WILLIAM T. ADAMS.     PREFACE.   This volume is not altogether a military romance, though it contains the adventures of one of those noble-hearted and patriotic young men who went forth from homes of plenty and happiness to fight the battles of our imperilled country. The incidents of the story may be stirring and exciting; yet they are not only within the bounds of probability, but have been more than paralleled in the experience of hundreds of the gallant soldiers of the loyal army.  The work is not intended to approach the dignity of a history, though the writer has carefully consulted the \"authorities,\" both loyal and rebel, and has taken down the living words of enthusiastic participants in the stirring scenes described in this volume. He has not attempted to give a full picture of any battle, or other army operation, but simply of those movements in which the hero took a part. The book is a narrative of personal adventure, delineating the birth and growth of a pure patriotism in the soul of the hero, and describing the perils and privations, the battles and marches which he shared with thousands of brave men in the army of the Potomac.  The author has endeavored to paint a picture of the true soldier, one who loves his country, and fights for her because he loves her; but, at the same time, one who is true to himself and his God, while he is faithful to his patriotic impulses.  The work has been a pleasure to me in its preparation, and I hope it will not disappoint the reasonable expectation of those partial friends whose smile is my joy, whose frown is my grief. But, more than all, I trust this humble volume will have some small influence in kindling and cherishing that genuine patriotism which must ever be the salvation of our land, the foundation of our national prosperity and happiness.

Lieutenant Somers and Others     THE SOLDIER BOY;  OR,  TOM SOMERS IN THE ARMY.     CHAPTER I.  THE BATTLE OF PINCHBROOK.   \"Fort Sumter has surrendered, mother!\" shouted Thomas Somers, as he rushed into the room where his mother was quietly reading her Bible.  It was Sunday, and the exciting news had been circulated about the usually quiet village of Pinchbrook Harbor. Men's lips were compressed, and their teeth shut tight together. They were indignant, for traitors had fired upon the flag of the United States. Men, women, and children were roused by the indignity offered to the national emblem. The cannon balls that struck the walls of Sumter seemed at the same time to strike the souls of the whole population of the North, and never was there such a great awakening since the Pilgrim Fathers first planted their feet upon the rock of Plymouth.  \"Fort Sumter has surrendered!\" shouted the indignant young patriot again, as his mother looked up from the blessed volume.  \"You don't say so!\" exclaimed Mrs. Somers, as she closed the Bible, and removed her spectacles.  \"Yes, mother. The infernal rebels hammered away at the fort for two days, and at last we had to give in.\"  \"There'll be terrible times afore long,\" replied the old lady, shaking her head with prophetic earnestness.  \"The President has called for seventy-five thousand volunteers, and I tell you there'll be music before long!\" continued the youth, so excited that he paced the room with rapid strides.  \"What's the matter, Thomas?\" asked a feeble old gentleman, entering the room at this moment.  \"Fort Sumter has surrendered, gran'ther,\" repeated Thomas, at the top of his lungs, for the aged man was quite deaf; \"and the President has called for seventy-five thousand men to go down and fight the traitors.\"  \"Sho!\" exclaimed the old man, halting, and gazing with earnestness into the face of the boy.  \"It's a fact, gran'ther.\"  \"Well, I'm too old to go,\" muttered gran'ther Greene; \"but I wa'n't older'n you are when I shouldered my firelock in 1812. I'm too old and stiff to go now.\"  \"How old were you, gran'ther, when you went to the war?\" asked Thomas, with more moderation than he had exhibited before.  \"Only sixteen, Thomas; but I was as tall as I am now,\" replied the patriarch, dropping slowly and cautiously into the old-fashioned high-back chair, by the side of the cooking stove.  \"Well, I'm sixteen, and I mean to go.\"  \"You, Thomas! You are crazy! You shan't do any thing of the kind,\" interposed Mrs. Somers. \"There's men enough to go to the war, without such boys as you are.\"  \"You ain't quite stout enough to make a soldier, Thomas. You ain't so big as I was, when I went off to York state,\" added gran'ther Greene.  \"I should like to go any how,\" said Thomas, as he seated himself in a corner of the room, and began to think thoughts big enough for a full-grown man.  \"Fort Sumter has surrendered,\" shouted John Somers, rushing into the house as much excited as his brother had been.  \"We've heard all about it, John,\" replied his mother.  \"The President has called for seventy-five thousand men, and in my opinion the rebels will get an awful licking before they are a fortnight older. I should like to go and help do it.\"  The exciting news was discussed among the members of the Somers family, as it was in thousands of other families, on that eventful Sunday. Thomas and John could think of nothing, speak of nothing, but Fort Sumter, and the terrible castigation which the rebels would receive from the insulted and outraged North. They were loyal even to enthusiasm; and when they retired to their chamber at night, they ventured to express to each other their desire to join the great army which was to avenge the insult offered to the flag of the Union.  They were twin brothers, sixteen years of age; but they both thought they were old enough and strong enough to be soldiers. Their mother, however, had promptly disapproved of such suggestions, and they had not deemed it prudent to discuss the idea in her presence.  On Monday, the excitement instead of subsiding, was fanned to a fever heat; Pinchbrook Harbor was in a glow of patriotism. Men neglected their usual occupations, and talked of the affairs of the nation. Every person who could procure a flag hung it out at his window, or hoisted it in his yard, or on his house. The governor had called out a portion of the state militia, and already the tramp of armed men was heard in the neighboring city of Boston.  Thomas Somers was employed in a store in the village, and during the forenoon he mechanically performed the duties of his position; but he could think of nothing but the exciting topic of the day. His blood was boiling with indignation against those who had trailed our hallowed flag in the dust. He wanted to do something to redeem the honor of his country--something to wipe out the traitors who had dared to conspire against her peace. On his way home to dinner, he met Fred Pemberton, who lived only a short distance from his own house.  \"What do you think now, Fred?\" said Thomas.  \"What do I think? I think just as I always did--the North is wrong, and the South is right,\" replied Fred.  \"Who fired upon Fort Sumter? That's the question,\" said Thomas, his eyes flashing with indignation.  \"Why didn't they give up the fort, then?\"  \"Give up the fort! Shall the United States cave in before the little State of South Carolina. Not by a two chalks!\"  \"I think the North has been teasing and vexing the South till the Southerns can't stand it any longer. There'll be war now.\"  \"I hope there will! By gracious, I hope so!\"  \"I hope the South will beat!\"  \"Do you? Do you, Fred Pemberton?\" demanded Tom, so excited he could not stand still.  \"Yes, I do. The South has the rights of it. If we had let their niggers alone, there wouldn't have been any trouble.\"  \"You are as blind as a bat, Fred. Don't you see this isn't a quarrel between the North and the South, but between the government and the rebels?\"  \"I don't see it. If the North had let the South alone, there wouldn't have been any fuss. I hope the North will get whipped, and I know she will.\"  \"Fred, you are a traitor to your country!\"  \"No, I'm not!\"  \"Yes, you are; and if I had my way, I'd ride you on a rail out of town.\"  \"No, you wouldn't.\"  \"Yes, I would. I always thought you were a decent fellow; but you are a dirty, low-lived traitor.\"  \"Better be careful what you say, Tom Somers!\" retorted the young secessionist, angrily.  \"A fellow that won't stand by his country ain't fit to live. You are an out-and-out traitor.\"  \"Don't call me that again, Tom Somers,\" replied Fred, doubling up his fist.  \"I say you are a traitor.\"  \"Take that, then.\"  Tom did take it, and it was a pretty hard blow on the side of his head. Perhaps it was fortunate for our young patriot that an"]]]
