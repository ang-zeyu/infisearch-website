His eyes blink now and then._  _And now, sleigh-bells are heard in the distance._  Hark! _cries_ JACK FROST.  _They all listen: the bells are still heard, a little nearer._  _Then_ JACK FROST _continues_: There comes Santa Claus, sure enough. Let's give the old fellow a surprise. Here! All hide behind the Chimney.  _Very quickly, but very quietly, too, they all hide. The sleigh-bells come nearer and nearer, till they seem to be just outside: then they stop, and a voice, which plainly belongs to_ SANTA CLAUS, _says_: Whoa! Quiet, Prancer! Blitzen, stand still there!  _And now Santa Claus himself appears, with his pack of toys. He walks to the middle of the roof, and sets down the pack._  It certainly is getting cold, _says_ SANTA CLAUS _to himself. For he does not see Jack Frost and the Snow Fairies, who are hidden behind the Chimney. He goes on talking_: And what a lot of snow there is about here. It is really like the Christmas eves we used to have fifty years ago. My pack seems to be coming undone. _He stoops to fix it._ I should hate to have it burst open, while I was going down the Chimney.  _Now the Snow Fairies have come out from behind the Chimney, and are stealing up behind him on tip-toe. When they are quite close, they throw great handfuls of snow at him. He starts up, surprised, but bursts into a great laugh_:  Ho! ho! ho! This is a fine way to treat an old man! _says_ SANTA CLAUS. Ho! ho! ho! ho! This is fine fun indeed! Hello, Jack Frost, is that you? And how are you, my little roley-poley snow-balls? White and light as ever, I see. And you've made me all white too, but not very light, I fear. Well, well, be off with you, for I must go down the Chimney.  _He bows to the Chimney, whose eyes blink through the snow._  Good evening, my old friend, _says_ SANTA CLAUS. YOU are enjoying good health, I hope. May I climb down inside of you as usual?  THE CHIMNEY _answers, in a muffled voice, because he is so covered up with snow_: Go ahead, Santa, I'm used to it.  _So Santa Claus climbs to the top of the Chimney, steps over, and after throwing a kiss to the Snow Fairies, who return it, he goes down out of sight._  _And that is the end of the First Scene._         *       *       *       *       *     THE INTERLUDE   _Again, before the Second Scene begins_, MOTHER GOOSE _comes out in front of the curtain and this is what she says_:  Well, my dears, I hope you are enjoying my little Play. And what do you suppose comes next? Wouldn't you like to see who lives down inside that house, where the chimney was; and what they were doing while Jack Frost and the others were up on the roof, and whether they heard the Wind Fairies; and whether they knew that the Snow Fairies had come; and how they came to make that mistake, lighting a fire in the fireplace where Santa Claus had come down? Well, that is just what the next scene is to be about. Last time we were up on the roof; this time we shall be down in the Room, in front of the fire-place. So be still and listen carefully, for now it is going to begin.         *       *       *       *       *     The Second Scene   _When the curtain opens this time, you can see into the Room of the House, just as Mother Goose promised. Notice that on one side of the fire-place is a window with curtains drawn, on the other, a washstand with howl and pitcher. In front, on right and left, are two large beds. In the middle of the room, with her hack to the fire-place, the Grandmother is seated on a low chair, and about her in a half-circle on stools, sit the eight grandchildren, four girls and four boys, all in their night-clothes and wrappers._  ISABEL _begins by asking_: Grandmother, how old are you?  GRANDMOTHER _replies_: How old do you think, my dear?  ISABEL _guesses_: A hundred?  Almost, _says_ GRANDMOTHER: Why, I can remember when all your mothers and fathers were little boys and girls like you. Your mother, Margaret and Sally, and your father, Jack and Tom and Helen, and your father, Isabel, and your mother, Ned and Frank, were my little boys and girls, you know; and on Christmas Eve I used to sit with them in the nursery, just as I am sitting with you now. That is why I told them to go downstairs and leave me alone with you for a little while tonight--for the sake of old times. Yes, they used to sit around me just like this, and then I used to tell them a story.  A story! A story! _cry_ ALL THE CHILDREN.  _And_ GRANDMOTHER _says_: Shall I tell you one? _The children all nod_. Let me think, _says she_.  _The Wind Fairies are heard outside, making the wind-noise, like this_:     z--z--z  z--z--z  z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   z--z--z  z--z--z  z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   GRANDMOTHER _listens to them, then begins her story_: Well, once there was a wicked king, who didn't like cold weather; so he sent his soldiers, and told them to catch all the cold Wind Fairies and--  TOM _interrupts her to ask_: Are there really Wind Fairies, Grandmother?  GRANDMOTHER _answers_: Of course there are. I think I heard them a moment ago. Listen!  _They all listen. The Wind Fairies are heard outside, like this_:    z--z--z z--z--z z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   Do you hear them? _asks_ GRANDMOTHER. _The children all nod_. Yes, _she continues, going on with the story_, the king told his soldiers to catch all the Wind Fairies, and all the Snow Fairies, and Jack Frost himself, and to lock them all up in prison.  And did the soldiers do it? _asks_ HELEN.  Yes, _answers_ GRANDMOTHER. They locked up all of them except one little Wind Fairy, and he was so small and so quick, that they couldn't catch him; and what do you suppose he did? He rattled the windows so hard that the king couldn't sleep, and he blew so hard down the chimney and through the cracks around the doors, that he blew out all the lights in the king's house, and gave the king such a bad cold in his head, that--  _Here Grandmother herself sneezes. And the Wind Fairies are heard outside, like this_:    z--z--z  z--z--z  z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   How the wind does blow tonight, _says_ GRANDMOTHER. Children, it seems to me very cold in this room. _She looks around to see what makes it so chilly._ Why, bless me, _she says_, they have forgotten to light the fire. _She rises, the children also, and they all go toward the fire-place._ Frank, _says_ GRANDMOTHER, hand me the matches. _He brings them. She stoops at the hearth, the children standing around, and soon a bright glow appears and is seen to dance about._ There, that will soon make a fine blaze, _says she._ Hold up your hands, children, and warm them.  _But suddenly from up the chimney comes the voice of_ JACK FROST: Hello there, you people, put that fire out. _Grandmother and the children are startled._ Do you hear? _shouts_ JACK FROST. Put it out. Santa Claus is coming. Do you hear what I say? SANTA CLAUS IS COMING. Put out that fire.  Why, children, _cries_ GRANDMOTHER, I had forgotten all about that. Quick! We must indeed put the fire out at once. Ned, bring me that pitcher of water.  _He brings it; she throws the water on the fire. The glow disappears and a great hissing sound is heard, loud at first, then dying away, like this_:    S--S--S--s--s--s--s--s--s--s--s--s--s--s   There! _says_ GRANDMOTHER. It is quite out, you see. And now, you must hang up your stockings, quickly, and hurry into bed. _A shrill whistle is heard outside_. What was that? GRANDMOTHER _asks_.  It sounded like a whistle out of doors, _answers_ MARGARET; _and she goes to the window and looks out._ Why, Grandmother, _says she_, it's beginning to snow.  Good! _says_ GRANDMOTHER. That will make it easier for Santa Claus to get here in his sleigh. So make haste with your stockings, and then, before you get into bed, we will read from the Good Book about what happened on the first Christmas night so many, many years ago.  _They bring their stockings and hang them in a row over the fire-place. Meantime Grandmother has taken the big Bible, and seated herself in the low chair in the middle of the room. The children, when the stockings are hung, group themselves beside her, standing, looking over her shoulders, her arms around some of them. Then_ GRANDMOTHER _reads_:  And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.  And the angel said unto them, \"Be not afraid; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this shall be the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger?\"  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\"  And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, \"Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.\"  And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.  _Then_ GRANDMOTHER _closes the Book_. And now your prayers, _says she_.  _They all kneel down for a few moments, the boys by the bed on the right, the girls by the bed on the left. Then they rise and climb into the beds._  _But_ SALLY _has a question to ask_: May we sing one song, Grandmother, before we go to sleep?  _And_ GRANDMOTHER _answers_, Well, just one.  _Then sitting up in the bed, they sing the dear old song, that is called_   THE CAROL OF CHRISTMAS NIGHT    Holy night! peaceful night!   All is dark save the light   Yonder where they sweet vigil keep   O'er the Babe, who in silent sleep   Rests in heavenly peace.    Silent night! holiest night!  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14785"],["title","Down the Chimney (#2)"],["body"," Darkness flies; all is light!   Shepherds hear the angels sing,   \"Hallelujah! Hail the King!   Christ, the Saviour, is here,   Jesus, the Saviour, is here.\"   _When the song is finished, they all lie down. Grandmother tucks the bed-clothes about their shoulders, and goes out. Soon they are all asleep._  _Then a faint sound of sleigh-bells is heard on the roof._  _Then all is quiet for a moment._  _And THEN Santa Claus comes down the chimney, and steps out into the room. Silently he looks at both beds, full of sleeping children, turning his pocket flash light on them, so as to see them better. He counts the children in each bed. Then he counts the stockings hanging by the fire-place to be sure they are all there. Next he fills each of the stockings, taking the toys out of his pack. Then he takes his empty bag, and, after looking once more at the children, he disappears up the Chimney._  _And this is the end of the Play_.         *       *       *       *       *     Characters And Costumes   MOTHER GOOSE--The conventional costume; full skirt, peaked hat, cane, spectacles, mits. It is effective for her to draw her lips tight over her teeth so that her speech is that of a toothless old woman.  JACK FROST--All in white, decorated with tinsel, tall peaked cap, white gloves.  THE CHIMNEY--No costume; for he sits inside the chimney throughout.  THE WIND FAIRIES--Four little boys, all in gray, capes, caps, half-masks, long stockings.  THE SNOW FAIRIES--Four little girls, all in white, capes or coats, hoods, muffs. The muffs full of loose cotton, which they use as snow, to hang on trees and chimney, and to throw at Santa Claus.  SANTA CLAUS--The conventional costume; white hair and beard; pack, with few toys protruding from the top.  THE GRANDMOTHER--Gray hair, lace cap, gray or black dress.  THE GRANDCHILDREN--Four boys in pajamas, with wrappers over them; four girls in night dresses with kimonos over them.     Scenery And Scenic Effects  SCENE I.   The Chimney, which must be large enough to hold two people, one of them Santa Claus with his pack of toys, may consist of a light frame covered with turkey red cambric and backed with cardboard or heavy paper. The cambric should be marked off into bricks. The face is produced by cutting away the cardboard or paper backing behind two bricks for the eyes, one for the nose and two together for the mouth. Boxes must cover these openings on the inside, one for each eye and a larger one for mouth and nose together. In these three boxes are three electric lights which can be turned on and off independently by the boy inside the chimney. Dry batteries have been used when an electric current was not available. The light shining through the cambric makes the face. Turning off, and on again, the light behind one of the eyes makes the chimney wink, etc. Small hooks or nails, sticking out above the eyes, under the nose, and under the mouth, should be provided to hold the snow which the fairies hang on to represent eyebrows, mustache and beard.  The background and flies for this scene should be made of black cambric, dull side out, and a dim light should be used, blue or green preferable, so distributed as not to throw shadows on the \"sky.\"  The trees may be real spruces or pines, or may be painted, or may be made of green cambric touched up with paint or charcoal.  The wind noise is made by some one behind the scenes, preferably not the Wind Fairies themselves. It should be plainly heard. The same applies to the sound of water thrown on the fire.  If accompaniment is desired for the songs, a violin gives a better effect than a piano.  The effect of falling snow is produced by a simple machine, consisting of a connected series of perforated cardboard boxes suspended from a cord or wire, and filled with finely cut paper. At one end they are attached to a wire spring, and by a cord at the other end they are shaken, so as to make the paper snow shower down. Such a machine may be bought for a small sum from firms dealing in Sunday School supplies. Two of them used together are more adequate than one.   SCENE II.   It is not necessary to use real beds. Boards on low horses or boxes will make excellent substitutes, and a strip of cloth will conceal their structure. An advantage of this plan is that they need not be as long as regulation beds. Four children to a bed means packing them like sardines, but it can be done, and it always amuses the audience.  The effect of a fire on the hearth can be made by quick motions with an ever-ready flashlight operated from behind. The children and Grandmother, standing in front, allow but an imperfect view of the fire-place, so that the illusion is easy to produce. The fireplace, however, may be a real one, if that is more convenient. In that case the flashlight must be operated by one of the children, kneeling in front of the fire-place; and when Santa Claus enters the room must be absolutely dark, so that he will first be seen when he turns on his flashlight, as he crouches before the fire-place, having apparently just come down the chimney.  If candies or gifts are to be distributed to children in the audience, as when this play is used as the Christmas entertainment of a Sunday School, Mother Goose may come out again, as soon as the curtain closes after the second scene, and speak as follows:  Well, my dear children, my little Play for you is finished, and I hope you liked it. There is just one thing left to be said. Those little boys and girls whom you saw asleep in their beds found that Santa Claus had not only put into their stockings presents for THEM, but also left something for YOU; and what do you suppose it was? A box of candy for each one of you, and if you will sit still a moment longer, the curtain will open again, and the candy will be handed to you. And so, my dears, as I say Good-night, I wish you all (or I hope you have all had) a Merry Christmas and (wish you) a Happy New Year."]]]
