Wells-Barnett     PREFACE   The greater part of what is contained in these pages was published in the _New York Age_ June 25, 1892, in explanation of the editorial which the Memphis whites considered sufficiently infamous to justify the destruction of my paper, the _Free Speech_.  Since the appearance of that statement, requests have come from all parts of the country that \"Exiled\" (the name under which it then appeared) be issued in pamphlet form. Some donations were made, but not enough for that purpose. The noble effort of the ladies of New York and Brooklyn Oct. 5 have enabled me to comply with this request and give the world a true, unvarnished account of the causes of lynch law in the South.  This statement is not a shield for the despoiler of virtue, nor altogether a defense for the poor blind Afro-American Sampsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed by white Delilahs. It is a contribution to truth, an array of facts, the perusal of which it is hoped will stimulate this great American Republic to demand that justice be done though the heavens fall.  It is with no pleasure I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed. Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so. The awful death-roll that Judge Lynch is calling every week is appalling, not only because of the lives it takes, the rank cruelty and outrage to the victims, but because of the prejudice it fosters and the stain it places against the good name of a weak race.  The Afro-American is not a bestial race. If this work can contribute in any way toward proving this, and at the same time arouse the conscience of the American people to a demand for justice to every citizen, and punishment by law for the lawless, I shall feel I have done my race a service. Other considerations are of minor importance.  IDA B. WELLS _New York City_, Oct. 26, 1892     To the Afro-American women of New York and Brooklyn, whose race love, earnest zeal and unselfish effort at Lyric Hall, in the City of New York, on the night of October 5, 1892--made possible its publication, this pamphlet is gratefully dedicated by the author.     HON. FRED. DOUGLASS'S LETTER   _Dear Miss Wells:_  Let me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination now generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has been no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word is feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual knowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity and left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.  Brave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can neither be weighed nor measured. If American conscience were only half alive, if the American church and clergy were only half christianized, if American moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of outrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame and indignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.  But alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions favorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by earth and Heaven yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in the power of a merciful God for final deliverance.  Very truly and gratefully yours, FREDERICK DOUGLASS _Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C._, Oct. 25, 1892     1 _The_ OFFENSE   Wednesday evening May 24, 1892, the city of Memphis was filled with excitement. Editorials in the daily papers of that date caused a meeting to be held in the Cotton Exchange Building; a committee was sent for the editors of the _Free Speech_ an Afro-American journal published in that city, and the only reason the open threats of lynching that were made were not carried out was because they could not be found. The cause of all this commotion was the following editorial published in the _Free Speech_ May 21, 1892, the Saturday previous.    Eight negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at   Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)   into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one   near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for   killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm   about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting   bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter.    Nobody in this section of the country believes the old thread-bare lie   that Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful,   they will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a   reaction; a conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging   to the moral reputation of their women.  The _Daily Commercial_ of Wednesday following, May 25, contained the following leader:    Those negroes who are attempting to make the lynching of individuals of   their race a means for arousing the worst passions of their kind are   playing with a dangerous sentiment. The negroes may as well understand   that there is no mercy for the negro rapist and little patience with his   defenders. A negro organ printed in this city, in a recent issue   publishes the following atrocious paragraph: \"Nobody in this section of   the country believes the old thread-bare lie that negro men rape white   women. If Southern white men are not careful they will overreach   themselves, and public sentiment will have a reaction; and a conclusion   will be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of   their women.\"    The fact that a black scoundrel is allowed to live and utter such   loathsome and repulsive calumnies is a volume of evidence as to the   wonderful patience of Southern whites. But we have had enough of it.    There are some things that the Southern white man will not tolerate, and   the obscene intimations of the foregoing have brought the writer to the   very outermost limit of public patience. We hope we have said enough.  The _Evening Scimitar_ of same date, copied the _Commercial_'s editorial with these words of comment:    Patience under such circumstances is not a virtue. If the negroes   themselves do not apply the remedy without delay it will be the duty of   those whom he has attacked to tie the wretch who utters these calumnies   to a stake at the intersection of Main and Madison Sts., brand him in   the forehead with a hot iron and perform upon him a surgical operation   with a pair of tailor's shears.  Acting upon this advice, the leading citizens met in the Cotton Exchange Building the same evening, and threats of lynching were freely indulged, not by the lawless element upon which the deviltry of the South is usually saddled--but by the leading business men, in their leading business centre. Mr. Fleming, the business manager and owning a half interest the _Free Speech_, had to leave town to escape the mob, and was afterwards ordered not to return; letters and telegrams sent me in New York where I was spending my vacation advised me that bodily harm awaited my return. Creditors took possession of the office and sold the outfit, and the _Free Speech_ was as if it had never been.  The editorial in question was prompted by the many inhuman and fiendish lynchings of Afro-Americans which have recently taken place and was meant as a warning. Eight lynched in one week and five of them charged with rape! The thinking public will not easily believe freedom and education more brutalizing than slavery, and the world knows that the crime of rape was unknown during four years of civil war, when the white women of the South were at the mercy of the race which is all at once charged with being a bestial one.  Since my business has been destroyed and I am an exile from home because of that editorial, the issue has been forced, and as the writer of it I feel that the race and the public generally should have a statement of the facts as they exist. They will serve at the same time as a defense for the Afro-Americans Sampsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed by white Delilahs.  The whites of Montgomery, Ala., knew J.C. Duke sounded the keynote of the situation--which they would gladly hide from the world, when he said in his paper, the _Herald_, five years ago: \"Why is it that white women attract negro men now more than in former days? There was a time when such a thing was unheard of. There is a secret to this thing, and we greatly suspect it is the growing appreciation of white Juliets for colored Romeos.\" Mr. Duke, like the _Free Speech_ proprietors, was forced to leave the city for reflecting on the \"honah\" of white women and his paper suppressed; but the truth remains that Afro-American men do not always rape(?) white women without their consent.  Mr. Duke, before leaving Montgomery, signed a card disclaiming any intention of slandering Southern white women. The editor of the _Free Speech_ has no disclaimer to enter, but asserts instead that there are many white women in the South who would marry colored men if such an act would not place them at once beyond the pale of society and within the clutches of the law. The miscegnation laws of the South only operate against the legitimate union of the races; they leave the white man free to seduce all the colored girls he can, but it is death to the colored man who yields to the force and advances of a similar attraction in white women.

Mrs. J.S. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an Afro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in 1888, stumping the State for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the kitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to drive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her, and when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible condition. She did not know the man but could identify him. She pointed out William Offett, a married man, who was arrested and, being in Ohio, was granted a trial.  The prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went to Mrs. Underwood's residence at her invitation and was criminally intimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the sworn testimony of a ministers wife, a lady of the highest respectability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary, December 14, 1888, for fifteen years. Some time afterwards the woman's remorse led her to confess to her husband that the man was innocent.  These are her words:    I met Offett at the Post Office. It was raining. He was polite to me,   and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry them home   for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I invited   him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the   children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then   I sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why   I did so, I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several   times after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after   the first time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to   resist.  When asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she said: \"I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw the fellows here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome disease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro baby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie.\" Her husband horrified by the confession had Offett, who had already served four years, released and secured a divorce.  There are thousands of such cases throughout the South, with the difference that the Southern white men in insatiate fury wreak their vengeance without intervention of law upon the Afro-Americans who consort with their women. A few instances to substantiate the assertion that some white women love the company of the Afro-American will not be out of place. Most of these cases were reported by the daily papers of the South.  In the winter of 1885-86 the wife of a practicing physician in Memphis, in good social standing whose name has escaped me, left home, husband and children, and ran away with her black coachman. She was with him a month before her husband found and brought her home. The coachman could not be found. The doctor moved his family away from Memphis, and is living in another city under an assumed name.  In the same city last year a white girl in the dusk of evening screamed at the approach of some parties that a Negro had assaulted her on the street. He was captured, tried by a white judge and jury, that acquitted him of the charge. It is needless to add if there had been a scrap of evidence on which to convict him of so grave a charge he would have been convicted.  Sarah Clark of Memphis loved a black man and lived openly with him. When she was indicted last spring for miscegenation, she swore in court that she was _not_ a white woman. This she did to escape the penitentiary and continued her illicit relation undisturbed. That she is of the lower class of whites, does not disturb the fact that she is a white woman. \"The leading citizens\" of Memphis are defending the \"honor\" of _all_ white women, _demi-monde_ included.  Since the manager of the _Free Speech_ has been run away from Memphis by the guardians of the honor of Southern white women, a young girl living on Poplar St., who was discovered in intimate relations with a handsome mulatto young colored man, Will Morgan by name, stole her father's money to send the young fellow away from that father's wrath. She has since joined him in Chicago.  The _Memphis Ledger_ for June 8 has the following:    If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl seventeen years of age, who   is now at the City Hospital, would be somewhat less reserved about her   disgrace there would be some very nauseating details in the story of her   life. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might reveal fearful   depravity or it might reveal the evidence of a rank outrage. She will   not divulge the name of the man who has left such black evidence of her   disgrace, and, in fact, says it is a matter in which there can be no   interest to the outside world. She came to Memphis nearly three months   ago and was taken in at the Woman's Refuge in the southern part of the   city. She remained there until a few weeks ago, when the child was born.   The ladies in charge of the Refuge were horified. The girl was at once   sent to the City Hospital, where she has been since May 30. She is a   country girl. She came to Memphis from her fathers farm, a short   distance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she would not   say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from Arkansas, and says her   home is in that State. She is rather good looking, has blue eyes, a low   forehead and dark red hair. The ladies at the Woman's Refuge do not know   anything about the girl further than what they learned when she was an   inmate of the institution; and she would not tell much. When the child   was born an attempt was made to get the girl to reveal the name of the   Negro who had disgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was   impossible to elicit any information from her on the subject.  Note the wording. \"The truth might reveal fearful depravity or rank outrage.\" If it had been a white child or Lillie Bailey had told a pitiful story of Negro outrage, it would have been a case of woman's weakness or assault and she could have remained at the Woman's Refuge. But a Negro child and to withhold its father's name and thus prevent the killing of another Negro \"rapist.\" A case of \"fearful depravity.\"  The very week the \"leading citizens\" of Memphis were making a spectacle of themselves in defense of all white women of every kind, an Afro-American, M. Stricklin, was found in a white woman's room in that city. Although she made no outcry of rape, he was jailed and would have been lynched, but the woman stated she bought curtains of him (he was a furniture dealer) and his business in her room that night was to put them up. A white woman's word was taken as absolutely in this case as when the cry of rape is made, and he was freed.  What is true of Memphis is true of the entire South. The daily papers last year reported a farmer's wife in Alabama had given birth to a Negro child. When the Negro farm hand who was plowing in the field heard it he took the mule from the plow and fled. The dispatches also told of a woman in South Carolina who gave birth to a Negro child and charged three men with being its father, _every one of whom has since disappeared_. In Tuscumbia, Ala., the colored boy who was lynched there last year for assaulting a white girl told her before his accusers that he had met her there in the woods often before.  Frank Weems of Chattanooga who was not lynched in May only because the prominent citizens became his body guard until the doors of the penitentiary closed on him, had letters in his pocket from the white woman in the case, making the appointment with him. Edward Coy who was burned alive in Texarkana, January 1, 1892, died protesting his innocence. Investigation since as given by the Bystander in the _Chicago Inter Ocean_, October 1, proves:    1. The woman who was paraded as a victim of violence was of bad   character; her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.    2. She was publicly reported and generally known to have been criminally   intimate with Coy for more than a year previous.    3. She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge   against the victim.    4. When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him   after they had \"been sweethearting\" so long.    5. A large majority of the \"superior\" white men prominent in the affair   are the reputed fathers of mulatto children.    These are not pleasant facts, but they are illustrative of the vital   phase of the so-called race question, which should properly be   designated an earnest inquiry as to the best methods by which religion,   science, law and political power may be employed to excuse injustice,   barbarity and crime done to a people because of race and color. There   can be no possible belief that these people were inspired by any   consuming zeal to vindicate God's law against miscegnationists of the   most practical sort. The woman was a willing partner in the victim's   guilt, and being of the \"superior\" race must naturally have been more   guilty.  In Natchez, Miss., Mrs. Marshall, one of the _creme de la creme_ of the city, created a tremendous sensation several years ago. She has a black coachman who was married, and had been in her employ several years. During this time she gave birth to a child whose color was remarked, but traced to some brunette ancestor, and one of the fashionable dames of the city was its godmother. Mrs. Marshall's social position was unquestioned, and wealth showered every dainty on this child which was idolized with its brothers and sisters by its white papa. In course of time another child appeared on the scene, but it was"]]]
