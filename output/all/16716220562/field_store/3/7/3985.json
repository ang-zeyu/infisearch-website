Hooray! Yes, that's what I sing and I say!\"  Marjorie was coming downstairs in her own sweet way, which was accomplished by putting her two feet close together, and jumping two steps at a time. It didn't expedite her descent at all, but it was delightfully noisy, and therefore agreeable from Marjorie's point of view.  The May-day was undeniably beautiful. It was warm enough to have doors and windows flung open, and the whole house was full of May that had swarmed in from out of doors.  The air was soft and fragrant, the leaves were leaving out, the buds were budding, and the spring was springing everywhere.  The big gold bushes of the Forsythia were masses of yellow bloom; crocuses popped up through the grass; a few birds had begun to sing, and the sun shone as if with a settled determination to push the spring ahead as fast as he could.  Moreover it was Saturday, which was the best proof of all, of an intelligent and well-behaved Spring. For a May-day which knew enough to fall on a Saturday was a satisfactory May-day, indeed!  Of course there was to be a May party, and of course it was to be at the Maynards', because Marjorie always claimed that the whole month of May belonged to their family, and she improved every shining hour of the Maytime.  The May party was really under the auspices of the Jinks Club. But as the club was largely composed of Maynards, it was practically a Maynard May party.  The bowers for the May Queens had been built out on the lawn, and though a little wabbly as to architecture, they were beautiful of decoration, and highly satisfactory to the Royalty most interested.  There were two May Queens, because Marjorie and Delight both wanted the position; and though both were willing to resign in favor of the other it was a much pleasanter arrangement to have two Queens. So there were two bowers, and Marjorie was to be the Red Queen and Delight the White Queen.  Of course Kingdon was the May King. No one had ever heard of a May King before, but that didn't bother the Jinks Club any, for they were a law unto themselves.  Kitty and Dorothy Adams were Princesses of May, and Flip Henderson was a Prince of May. Rosy Posy was a May Maid of Honor, and Mrs. Maynard was persuaded to accept the role of Queen Dowager of May.  Miss Hart was of the party, and the title of Duchess of May seemed to fit her exactly.  And now the time had come, and Marjorie was jumping downstairs on her way to her own coronation. She wore a red dress, very much trimmed with flowers made of red tissue paper. The name of the flower doesn't matter, for they were not exact copies of nature, but they were very pretty and effective, and red silk stockings and slippers finished off the brilliant costume that was very becoming to Marjorie's rosy face, with its dark eyes and dark curly hair.  As she reached the lower hall she saw Delight coming across the street, arrayed as the White Queen. Really she looked more like a fairy, with her frilly white frock and her golden hair and blue eyes.  \"Hello, Flossy Flouncy!\" called out King, using his pet name for Delight; \"you're a daisy May Queen! I offer you my humble homage!\"  A daisy May Queen was an appropriate term, for Delight's white frock was trimmed and wreathed with garlands of daisies. Not real ones, for they were not yet in bloom, except in green-houses; and so artificial ones had been sewn on her frock with pretty effect.  King's own attempt at a regal costume had resulted gorgeously, for with his mother's help, he had contrived a robe of state, which looked like purple velvet and ermine, though it was really canton flannel. But it had a grand and noble air, and King wore it with a majestic strut that would have done credit to any coronation.  Kitty and Dorothy wore light green dresses trimmed with pink paper roses, and were very pretty little princesses; while Rosy Posy as Maid of Honor wore one of her own little white frocks, tied up lavishly with blue ribbons.  Flip Henderson's costume was a good deal like King's, as he had purposely copied it, not having any other design to work from.  Mrs. Maynard and Miss Hart were not so fancifully attired as the younger members of the party, but they wore pretty light gowns with more or less floral decoration.  The whole affair was impromptu; the children had spent the morning getting it up, and now were going to devote the afternoon to the party itself.  \"We must make a procession,\" began Marjorie, who was mistress of ceremonies; \"you must go first, Mother, because the May Queen Dowager is the most honorable one.\"  \"Me go first, too,\" announced Rosy Posy, taking her mother's hand.  \"Yes, you may,\" said Marjorie. \"In fact, Baby, you'd better go first of all, because you're Maid of Honor; and so you walk in front of the Queen Dowager.\"  So Rosy Posy toddled ahead, followed by Mrs. Maynard, who carried a wand of flowers with gracious effect.  \"The Queens ought to come next,\" said King, but Marjorie's sense of politeness interfered with this plan.  \"No, the Duchess must come next,\" she said; \"I don't care whether it's right or not as a procession, but I think Miss Hart ought to go before us children.\"  So the Duchess of May took her place next in line, and then the two Queens side by side followed.  Then came the two Princesses, and behind them, the King of May and the Prince, walking together in affable companionship. It was an imposing sight, and the paraders were so pleased with themselves that they marched round the lawn several times before going to the scene of the festivity.  But at last they went to the Coronation Bowers, and decided it was time for the ceremonies to begin.  The two crowns were in readiness for the two Queens. They were exactly alike, and were made of pasteboard covered with gilt paper. Miss Hart had helped with these, and they were really triumphs of gorgeous beauty. Each lay on a lace-trimmed cushion, and with them were long golden sceptres with gilt balls on top.  \"Who's to do to the crowning?\" asked King.  \"Why, I supposed you had those details all settled in advance,\" said Miss Hart, laughing.  \"No,\" returned King, \"we didn't fix things up ahead much, we thought we'd just make up as we went along. I'll crown Flossy Flouncy, and Flip, you crown Marjorie,--that'll be all right.\"  The other members of the Royal Family took seats on rustic benches, and the two Queens mounted their thrones. The bowers were pretty, and as they stood side by side, framing the smiling Queens, it was a pretty picture.  \"I hate to stop the proceedings,\" said Miss Hart, \"but I think I must run over and get my camera, and take a snap-shot of this Coronation.\"  \"All right,\" said King, agreeably, \"we'll wait. We'll sing a song while you're gone, and you can skip over and back in no time.\"  So while the children sang the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" Miss Hart ran across the street, and came back with her camera.  \"Better wait until they get their crowns on,\" suggested Kitty, \"they'll look a heap queenlier then.\"  So the coronation ceremony proceeded. The King and the Prince advanced majestically to the thrones, bearing the crowns on their cushions.  \"Who'll make the speech?\" asked the King.  \"You may,\" said Flip, politely.  \"No, you're better at it than I am. Well, we'll each make one. You can begin.\"  So Flip advanced, and holding his burden high at arms' length he dropped on one knee before Marjorie, and began to declaim in oratorical tones:  \"Fair Maiden, Queen of May, I salute thee! I salute all the rest of you too, but mostly the Queen, because she is the principal pebble on the beach. Queens always are. And so, Fair Maiden, Fair Maynard Maiden, I salute thee.\"  \"That's enough saluting,\" put in King; \"go on with your crowning.\"  \"And so, fair Queen of May, I crown thee, our Queen and our Sovereign! May your shadow never grow less, and may you have many happy returns of the day! And with kind regards to all, I'm your humble servant.\"  Having set the crown squarely on Marjorie's head, Flip bowed low in humble salutation, and then resumed an upright position, rather pleased with his own speech.  \"I accept thy homage, O Prince,\" said Marjorie, as she bowed and smiled with queenly grace; \"and I shall endeavor to be the best Queen in all the world, except Delight, who will probably be better.\"  With this graceful tribute to her companion queen, Marjorie sat down, holding her head very straight lest her crown should tumble off.  Then King advanced to Delight, and holding up the other crown, began his declamatory effort.  \"Oh, Queen! Oh, White Queen! Oh, our beautiful sovereign! I bring to thee a crown,--a crown to crown you with, to show to all that you are our beloved and beloving Queen of May. Accept, oh, Queen, this crown and sceptre, and with them the assurance of our alleged loyalty, our humble submission, and our majestic royalty! I am a little at a loss for any thing further to say, as I can't think of any more highfalutin words, so you may as well put on your crown, and let's have some fun.\"  But though King's high-flown language failed him, it was with a very magnificent manner that he crowned his Queen and gave her the flower-trimmed sceptre.  Then Delight, looking lovelier than ever "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15072"],["title","Marjorie's Maytime (#1)"],["body","her added regalia, made her own little speech.  \"I thank you, my people, for your tokens of love and loyalty. I thank you for choosing me to be your queen, and my rule shall be a happy one. My only law is, for everybody to do just what they want to, and so I pronounce the Coronation Ceremonies over.\"  Delight bowed, and sat down on her throne, while the audience applauded heartily.  Then the two Queens came down from their bowers, and Royalty gave way to the members of the Jinks Club.  \"Now, let's cut up jinks!\" cried King, capering about in his long Court robes, and looking like a very merry Monarch, indeed. \"First the May-pole dance, that'll limber us up some.\"  A May-pole had been erected near by, and from its top depended long ribbons of various colors. Each of the party took one of these ribbons, and under the direction of Miss Hart, they danced round the May-pole, weaving the ribbons in and out. It was a complicated matter at first, but they soon learned how, and wove and unwove the ribbons many times without getting tangled once. As they danced, they sang a little May song that Miss Hart had taught them, and as they danced faster and faster it became a frolic rather than a dignified rite.  At last, all out of breath they dropped on the grass, and begged Miss Hart to tell them a story.  \"I'll tell you of the origin of the May-day celebrations,\" she said. \"May-day has been a festival since very ancient times. Its reason for being is the natural feeling that comes to every one at the glad spring time. When Nature breaks out into new life and beauty, our hearts feel a sympathetic gladness, and a celebration of the spring is the natural outcome. The most primitive people felt this inclination, and they used to gather the flowers that bloomed in profusion about them, set them up, and to pay them a sort of homage, expressed in dance and song. The old Romans had what they called Floralia, or Floral Games, which began on the twenty-eighth of April, and lasted several days. Later in England, and especially in the Middle Ages, it was the custom for people of all ranks, even the Court itself, to go out early in the morning on the first of May and gather flowers. Especially did they gather hawthorn, and huge branches of this flower were brought home about sunrise, with accompaniments of pipe and tabor, and much joy and merriment. Then the people decorated their houses with the flowers they had brought. And because of this, they called this ceremony bringing Home the May, or going A-Maying, and so the hawthorn bloom itself acquired the name of May, and is often spoken of by that name. In those early days, the fairest maid of the village was crowned with flowers, and called the Queen of May; she sat in state in a little bower or arbor while her youthful courtiers danced and sang around her. But the custom of having a May Queen really dates back to the old Roman celebration when they especially worshipped the goddess Flora. Another feature of May-day was the May-pole, which was erected in all English towns and villages, and round which the people danced all day long. But these merry customs were stopped when the Puritans put an end to all such jollifications. They were revived somewhat after the restoration, but they are rarely seen nowadays except among children. But they are all pretty customs, and the whole subject will well repay reading and study. I won't continue this lecture now, but before the month of May is over, we will study in school hours some of its characteristics, and we will read the poem of the May Queen, by Lord Tennyson.\"  \"I wish you had boys in your school, Miss Hart,\" said Flip Henderson; \"you do teach the nicest way I ever heard of.\"  \"Indeed she does,\" agreed Marjorie; \"going to school to Miss Hart was like going to a party every day.\"  And then came the crowning glory of the May party. This was the feast, which was served out of doors on a table prettily decorated with vines and flowers. Dainty sandwiches were tied up with pink ribbons, and little glass cups held delicious pink lemonade. The cakes were iced with pink, the ice cream was pink, and there were pink bon-bons of various sorts. At each plate was a little pink box of candies to take home; and a souvenir for each guest in the shape of a pink fan for the girls, and pink balloons for the boys. The big balloons made much fun as they bobbed about in the air, and when the feast was over, the guests went away declaring that the Jinks Club had never had a prettier party.     CHAPTER II  A NEW PET   When Mr. Maynard came home that night he was treated to an account of the whole affair, but as two or three of the little Maynards often talked at once, the effect was sometimes unintelligible.  \"It was the loveliest party, Father,\" said Marjorie, as she hung over one arm of his chair, and arranged a somewhat large bunch of blossoms in his buttonhole.  \"Yes, it was,\" agreed Kitty, who hung on the other arm of the chair, and investigated his coat pockets in the hope of finding a box of candy or other interesting booty.  \"It sure was!\" declared King, who was sitting on a footstool near, and hugging one knee with apparently intense affection.  \"And what made it so especially delightful?\" asked Mr. Maynard, as he balanced Rosy Posy on his knee; \"you tell me, Baby.\"  \"It was a bootiful party,\" said Rosy Posy, with decision, \"because we had pink ice cream.\"  \"That _was_ about the best part,\" said Kitty, reminiscently.  \"Well, the pink ice cream part sounds delightful, I'm sure; but what was the rest of the party about?\"  \"Oh, it was a May party,\" exclaimed Marjorie, \"and we had May Queens, and a May King, and May Princesses, and everything! I do love May, don't you, Father? Everything is so bright and bloomy and Maysy. I think it is the loveliest month in the year.\"  \"Yes, it is a lovely month, Mopsy, and a good month to be out of doors. Maytime is playtime.\"  \"Yes, I know it; I made a song this morning about that. I'll sing it to you.\" And Marjorie sang for her father the little verse she had mad about Marjorie Maynard's May.  \"Huh!\" said King, \"'tisn't your May, any more than anybody else's, Midget Maynard.\"  \"No, I know it; but I like to think the May just belongs to us Maynards. Anyway we have it all. It is our May even if other people use it, too.\"  \"I don't begrudge them the use of it,\" said Kitty; \"of course, it's just as much theirs as ours.\"  \"Yes, of course,\" assented Marjorie; \"I'm only just sort of imagining, you know.\"  \"Let me help you imagine. Midget,\" said her father. \"How would you like to imagine a whole May time that was all playtime?\"  \"For all of us?\" rejoined Marjorie, her eyes dancing. \"Oh, that would be a lovely imagination! It would be like an Ourday all the time! And by the way, Father, you owe us an extra Ourday. You know we skipped one when you and Mother were down South, and it's time for another anyway. Shall we have two together?\"  \"Two together!\" cried King; \"what fun that would be! We could go off on a trip or something.\"  \"Where could we stay all night?\" asked Kitty, who was the practical one.  \"Oh, trips always have places to stay all night,\" declared King; \"let's do it, Father. What do you say?\"  \"I don't get a chance to say much of anything, among all you chatter-boxes. Rosy Posy, what do you say?\"  But the littlest Maynard was so nearly asleep that she had no voice in the matter under consideration, and at her father's suggestion, Nurse Nannie came and took her away to bed.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"what's all this about Ourday? And two of them together! When do you think I'm going to get my business done?\"  \"Well, but, Father, you owe them to us,\" said Marjorie, patting his cheek in her wheedlesome way. \"And you're not the kind of a business man who doesn't pay his debts, are you?\"  \"I hope not; that would be a terrible state of affairs! And so I owe you two Ourdays, do I?\"  \"Yes, one for April, and one for May.\"  It was the custom in the Maynard household to have an Ourday each month. On these occasions both Mr. and Mrs. Maynard devoted themselves all day long to the entertainment of the four children, and the four took turns in deciding what the nature of the entertainment should be. Much of the previous month their parents had been away, and the children looked forward to the celebration of the belated Ourday in connection with the one that belonged to the month of May.  \"Before we discuss the question further,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"I must tell you of something I did to-day. I adopted a new pet.\"  \"Oh, Father, what is it--a dog?\" cried Marjorie.  \"No, it isn't a dog; guess again.\"  \"A cat!\" Kitty guessed, while King said, \"A goat?\"  \"Wrong, all of you,\" said Mr. Maynard; \"now see if you can't guess it by asking twenty questions.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie, who was always ready for a game. \"Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?\"  \"All three; that is, it belongs to all three kingdoms.\"  \"Is it a house?\" asked Kitty.  \"No, it is not as big as a house.\"  \"Is it useful or ornamental?\" asked King.  \"Both; but its principal use is to give pleasure.\"  \"How lovely!\" cried Marjorie. \"I guess it's a fountain! Oh, Father, where are you going to put it--on the side lawn? And will it have goldfish in it, and shiny stones, and green water plants growing in it?\"  \"Wait a minute, Mops; don't go so fast! You see, it isn't a fountain, and if you should put water and goldfish in it, you'd spoil it entirely.\"  \"And any way, Father,\" said King, \"you said it was a pet, didn't you?\"  \"Yes, my boy, a sort of pet.\"  \"Can it talk?\"  \"No, it can't talk.\"  \"Oh, I made sure it was a talking machine. What kind of a sound does it make?\"  \"Well, it purrs sometimes.\"  \"Then it is a kitten after all,\" cried Kitty.  \"No, it isn't a kitten. It's bigger than a kitten.\"  \"An old cat!\" said Marjorie, scornfully.  \"Pooh,\" said King, \"we'll never get at it this way. Of course it isn't a cat! Father wouldn't make so much fuss over just a cat.\"  \"But "]]]
