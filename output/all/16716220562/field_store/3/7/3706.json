A Story for Young Folks  by  OLIVER OPTIC  Author of _The Boat Club_, _All Aboard_, _In Doors and Out_, etc.  Boston: Lee and Shepard, Publishers. New York: Lee, Shepard & Dillingham, 49 Greene Street  1872        TO  MY NEPHEW,  CHARLES HENRY POPE.   This Book  IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED.     PREFACE  The story contained in this volume is a record of youthful struggles, not only in the world without, but in the world within; and the success of the little hero is not merely a gathering up of wealth and honors, but a triumph over the temptations that beget the pilgrim on the plain of life.  The attainment of worldly prosperity is not the truest victory, and the author has endeavored to make the interest of his story depend more on the hero's devotion to principles than on his success in business.  Bobby Bright is a smart boy; perhaps the reader will think he is altogether too smart for one of his years.  This is a progressive age, and any thing which Young America may do need not surprise any person. That little gentleman is older than his father, knows more than his mother, can talk politics, smoke cigars, and drive a 2:40 horse.  He orders \"one stew\" with as much ease as a man of forty, and can even pronounce correctly the villanous names of sundry French and German wines and liqueurs.  One would suppose, to hear him talk, that he had been intimate with Socrates and Solon, with Napoleon and Noah Webster; in short, that whatever he did not know was not worth knowing.  In the face of these manifestations of exuberant genius, it would be absurd to accuse the author of making his hero do too much.  All he has done is to give this genius a right direction; and for politics, cigars, 2:40 horses, and \"one stew,\" he has substituted the duties of a rational and accountable being, regarding them as better fitted to develop the young gentleman's mind, heart, and soul.  Bobby Bright is something more than a smart boy.  He is a good boy, and makes a true man.  His daily life is the moral of the story, and the author hopes that his devotion to principle will make a stronger impression upon the mind of the young reader, than even the most exciting incidents of his eventful career.

IN WHICH BOBBY GOES A FISHING, AND CATCHES A HORSE.  \"By jolly!  I've got a bite!\" exclaimed Tom Spicer, a rough, hard-looking boy, who sat on a rock by the river's side, anxiously watching the cork float on his line.  \"Catch him, then,\" quietly responded Bobby Bright, who occupied another rock near the first speaker, as he pulled up a large pout, and, without any appearance of exultation, proceeded to unhook and place him in his basket.  \"You are a lucky dog, Bob,\" added Tom, as he glanced into the basket of his companion, which now contained six good-sized fishes.  \"I haven't caught one yet.\"  \"You don't fish deep enough.\"  \"I fish on the bottom.\"  \"That is too deep.\"  \"It don't make any difference how I fish; it is all luck.\"  \"Not all luck, Tom; there is something in doing it right.\"  \"I shall not catch a fish,\" continued Tom, in despair.  \"You'll catch something else, though, when you go home.\"  \"Will I?\"  \"I'm afraid you will.\"  \"Who says I will?\"  \"Didn't you tell me you were 'hooking jack'?  \"Who is going to know any thing about it?\"  \"The master will know you are absent.\"  \"I shall tell him my mother sent me over to the village on an errand.\"  \"I never knew a fellow to 'hook jack,' yet, without getting found out.\"  \"I shall not get found out unless you blow on me; and you wouldn't be mean enough to do that;\" and Tom glanced uneasily at his companion.  \"Suppose your mother should ask me if I had seen you.\"  \"You would tell her you have not, of course.\"  \"Of course?\"  \"Why, wouldn't you?  Wouldn't you do as much as that for a fellow?\"  \"It would be a lie.\"  \"A lie!  Humph!\"  \"I wouldn't lie for any fellow,\" replied Bobby, stoutly, as he pulled in his seventh fish, and placed him in the basket.  \"Wouldn't you?\"  \"No, I wouldn't.\"  \"Then, let me tell you this; if you peach on me I'll smash your head.\"  Tom Spicer removed one hand from the fish pole and, doubling his fist, shook it with energy at his companion.  \"Smash away,\" replied Bobby, coolly.  \"I shall not go out of my way to tell tales; but if your mother or the master asks me the question, I shall not lie.\"  \"Won't you?\"  \"No, I won't.\"  \"I'll bet you will;\" and Tom dropped his fish pole, and was on the point of jumping over to the rock occupied by Bobby, when the float of the former disappeared beneath the surface of the water.  \"You have got a bite,\" coolly interposed Bobby, pointing to the line.  Tom snatched the pole, and with a violent twitch, pulled up a big pout; but his violence jerked the hook out of the fish's mouth, and he disappeared beneath the surface of the river.  \"Just my luck!\" muttered Tom.  \"Keep cool, then.\"  \"I will fix you yet.\"  \"All right; but you had better not let go your pole again, or you will lose another fish.\"  \"I'm bound to smash your head, though.\"  \"No, you won't.\"  \"Won't I?\"  \"Two can play at that game.\"  \"Do you stump me?\"  \"No; I don't want to fight; I won't fight if I can help it.\"  \"I'll bet you won't!\" sneered Tom.  \"But I will defend myself.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"I am not a liar, and the fear of a flogging shall not make me tell a lie.\"'  \"Go to Sunday school--don't you?\"  \"I do; and besides that, my mother always taught me never to tell a lie.\"  \"Come! you needn't preach to me.  By and by, you will call me a liar.\"  \"No, I won't; but just now you told me you meant to lie to your mother, and to the master.\"  \"What if I did?  That is none of your business.\"  \"It is my business when you want me to lie for you, though; and I shall not do it.\"  \"Blow on me, and see what you will get.\"  \"I don't mean to blow on you.\"  \"Yes you do.\"  \"I will not lie about it; that's all.\"  \"By jolly! see that horse!\" exclaimed Tom, suddenly, as he pointed to the road leading to Riverdale centre.  \"By gracious!\" added Bobby, dropping his fish pole, as he saw the horse running at a furious rate up the road from the village.  The mad animal was attached to a chaise, in which was seated a lady, whose frantic shrieks pierced the soul of our youthful hero.  The course of the road was by the river's side for nearly half a mile, and crossed the stream at a wooden bridge but a few rods from the place where the boys were fishing.  Bobby Bright's impulses were noble and generous; and without stopping to consider the peril to which the attempt would expose him, he boldly resolved to stop that horse, or let the animal dash him to pieces on the bridge.  \"Now or never!\" shouted he, as he leaped from the rock, and ran with all his might to the bridge.  The shrieks of the lady rang in his ears, and seemed to command him, with an authority which he could not resist, to stop the horse.  There was no time for deliberation; and, indeed, Bobby did not want any deliberation.  The lady was in danger; if the horse's flight was not checked, she would be dashed in pieces; and what then could excuse him for neglecting his duty?  Not the fear of broken limbs, of mangled flesh, or even of a sudden and violent death.  It is true Bobby did not think of any of these things; though, if he had, it would have made no difference with him.  He was a boy who would not fight except in self-defence, but he had the courage to do a deed which might have made the stoutest heart tremble with terror.  Grasping a broken rail as he leaped over the fence, he planted himself in the middle of the bridge, which was not more than half as wide as the road at each end of it, to await the coming of the furious animal. On he came, and the piercing shrieks of the affrighted lady nerved him to the performance of his perilous duty.  The horse approached him at a mad run, and his feet struck the loose planks of the bridge.  The brave boy then raised his big club, and brandished it with all his might in the air.  Probably the horse did not mean any thing very bad; was only frightened, and had no wicked intentions towards the lady; so that when a new danger menaced him in front, he stopped suddenly, and with so much violence as to throw the lady forward from her seat upon the dasher of the chaise.  He gave a long snort, which was his way of expressing his fear.  He was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14762"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright: A Story for Young Folks (#1)"],["body","astonished at the sudden barrier to his further progress, and commenced running back.  \"Save me!\" screamed the lady.  \"I will, ma'am; don't be scared!\" replied Bobby, confidently, as he dropped his club, and grasped the bridle of the horse, just as he was on the point of whirling round to escape by the way he had come.  \"Stop him!  Do stop him!\" cried the lady.  \"Whoa!\" said Bobby, in gentle tones, as he patted the trembling horse on his neck.  \"Whoa, good horse!  Be quiet!  Whoa!\"  The animal, in his terror, kept running backward and forward; but Bobby persevered in his gentle treatment, and finally soothed him, so that he stood quiet enough for the lady to get out of the chaise.  \"What a miracle that I am alive!\" exclaimed she when she realized that she stood once more upon the firm earth.  \"Yes, ma'am, it is lucky he didn't break the chaise.  Whoa!  Good horse!  Stand quiet!\"  \"What a brave little fellow you are!\" said the lady, as soon as she could recover her breath so as to express her admiration of Bobby's bold act.  \"O, I don't mind it,\" replied he, blushing like a rose in June.  \"Did he run away with you?\"  \"No; my father left me in the chaise for a moment while he went into a store in the village, and a teamster who was passing by snapped his whip, which frightened Kate so that she started off at the top of her speed.  I was so terrified, that I screamed with all my might, which frightened her the more.  The more I screamed, the faster she ran.\"  \"I dare say.  Good horse!  Whoa, Kate!\"  \"She is a splendid creature; she never did such a thing before.  My father will think I am killed.\"  By this time, Kate had become quite reasonable, and seemed very much obliged to Bobby for preventing her from doing mischief to her mistress; for she looked at the lady with a glance of satisfaction, which her deliverer interpreted as a promise to behave better in future.  He relaxed his grasp upon the bridle, patted her upon the neck, and said sundry pleasant things to encourage her in her assumed purpose of doing better.  Kate appeared to understand Bobby's kind words, and declared as plainly as a horse could declare that she would be sober and tractable.  \"Now, ma'am, if you will get into the chaise again, I think Kate will let me drive her down to the village.\"  \"O, dear!  I should not dare to do so.\"  \"Then, if you please, I will drive down alone, so as to let your father know that you are safe.\"  \"Do.\"  \"I am sure he must feel very bad, and I may save him a great deal of pain, for a man can suffer a great deal in a very short time.\"  \"You are a little philosopher, as well as a hero, and if you are not afraid of Kate, you may do as you wish.\"  \"She seems very gentle now;\" and Bobby turned her round, and got into the chaise.  \"Be very careful,\" said the lady.  \"I will.\"  Bobby took the reins, and Kate, true to the promise she had virtually made, started off at a round pace towards the village.  He had not gone more than a quarter of a mile of the distance when he met a wagon containing three men, one of whom was the lady's father. The gestures which he made assured Bobby he had found the person whom he sought, and he stopped.  \"My daughter!  Where is she?\" gasped the gentleman, as he leaped from the wagon.  \"She is safe, sir,\" replied Bobby, with all the enthusiasm of his warm nature.  \"Thank God!\" added the gentleman, devoutly as he placed himself in the chaise by the side of Bobby.     CHAPTER II.  IN WHICH BOBBY BLUSHES SEVERAL TIMES, AND DOES A SUM IN ARITHMETIC.  Mr. Bayard, the owner of the horse, and the father of the lady whom Bobby had saved from impending death, was too much agitated to say much, even to the bold youth who had rendered him such a signal service.  He could scarcely believe the intelligence which the boy brought him; it seemed too good to be true.  He had assured himself that Ellen--for that was the young lady's name--was killed, or dreadfully injured.  Kate was driven at the top of her speed, and in a few moments reached the bridge, where Ellen was awaiting his arrival.  \"Here I am, father, alive and unhurt!\" cried Ellen, as Mr. Bayard stopped the horse.  \"Thank Heaven my child!\" replied the glad father, embracing his daughter.  \"I was sure you were killed.\"  \"No, father; thanks to this bold youth, I am uninjured.\"  \"I am under very great obligations to you, young man,\" continued Mr. Bayard, grasping Bobby's hand.  \"O, never mind, sir;\" and Bobby blushed just as he had blushed when the young lady spoke to him.  \"We shall never forget you--shall we, father?\" added Ellen.  \"No, my child; and I shall endeavor to repay, to some slight extent, our indebtedness to him.  But you have not yet told me how you were saved.\"  \"O, I merely stopped the horse; that's all,\" answered Bobby, modestly.  \"Yes, father, but he placed himself right before Kate when she was almost flying over the ground.  When I saw him, I was certain that he would lose his life, or be horribly mangled for his boldness,\" interposed Ellen.  \"It was a daring deed, young man, to place yourself before an affrighted horse in that manner,\" said Mr. Bayard.  \"I didn't mind it, sir.\"  \"And then he flourished a big club, almost as big as he is himself, in the air, which made Kate pause in her mad career, when my deliverer here grasped her by the bit and held her.\"  \"It was well and bravely done.\"  \"That it was, father; not many men would have been bold enough to do what he did,\" added Ellen, with enthusiasm.  \"Very true; and I feel, that I am indebted to him for your safety. What is your name, young man?\"  \"Robert Bright, sir.\"  Mr. Bayard took from his pocket several pieces of gold, which he offered to Bobby.  \"No, I thank you, sir,\" replied Bobby, blushing.  \"What! as proud as you are bold?\"  \"I don't like to be paid for doing my duty.\"  \"Bravo!  You are a noble little fellow!  But you must take this money, not as a reward for what you have done, but as a testimonial of my gratitude.\"  \"I would rather not, sir.\"  \"Do take it, Robert,\" added Ellen.  \"I don't like to take it.  It looks mean to take money for doing one's duty.\"  \"Take it, Robert, to please me;\" and the young lady smiled so sweetly that Bobby's resolution began to give way.  \"Only to please me, Robert.\"  \"I will, to please you; but I don't feel right about it.\"  \"You must not be too proud, Robert,\" said Mr. Bayard, as he put the gold pieces into his hand.  \"I am not proud, sir; only I don't like to be paid for doing my duty.\"  \"Not paid, my young friend.  Consider that you have placed me under an obligation to you for life.  This money is only an expression of my own and my daughter's feelings.  It is but a small sum, but I hope you will permit me to do something more for you, when you need it.  You will regard me as your friend as long as you live.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  \"When you want any assistance of any kind, come to me.  I live in Boston; here is my business card.\"  Mr. Bayard handed him a card, on which Bobby read, \"F. Bayard & Co., Booksellers and Publishers, No. ---- Washington Street, Boston.\"  \"You are very kind, sir.\"  \"I want you should come to Boston and see us too,\" interposed Ellen. \"I should be delighted to show you the city, to take you to the Athenaeum and the Museum.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Mr. Bayard inquired of Bobby about his parents, where he lived, and about the circumstances of his family.  He then took out his memorandum book, in which he wrote the boy's name and residence.  \"I am sorry to leave you now, Robert, but I have over twenty miles to ride to-day.  I should be glad to visit your mother, and next time I come to Riverdale, I shall certainly do so.\"  \"Thank you, sir; my mother is a very poor woman, but she will be glad to see you.\"  \"Now, good by, Robert.\"  \"Good by,\" repeated Ellen.  \"Good by.\"  Mr. Bayard drove off, leaving Bobby standing on the bridge with the gold pieces in his hand.  \"Here's luck!\" said Bobby, shaking the coin.  \"Won't mother's eyes stick out when she sees these shiners?  There are no such shiners in the river as these.\"  Bobby was astonished, and the more he gazed at the gold pieces, the more bewildered he became.  He had never held so much money in his hand before.  There were three large coins and one smaller one.  He turned them over and over, and finally ascertained that the large coins were ten dollar pieces, and the smaller one a five dollar piece.  Bobby was not a great scholar, but he knew enough of arithmetic to calculate the value of his treasure.  He was so excited, however, that he did not arrive at the conclusion half so quick as most of my young readers would have done.  \"Thirty-five dollars!\" exclaimed Bobby, when the problem was solved. \"Gracious!\"  \"Hallo, Bob!\" shouted Tom Spicer, who had got tired of fishing; besides, the village clock was just striking twelve, and it was time for him to go home.  Bobby made no answer, but hastily tying the gold pieces up in the corner of his handkerchief, he threw the broken rail he had used in stopping the horse where it belonged, and started for the place where he had left his fishing apparatus.  \"Hallo, Bob!\"  \"Well, Tom?\"  \"Stopped him--didn't you?\"  \"I did.\"  \"You were a fool; he might have killed you.\"  \"So he might; but I didn't stop to think of that.  The lady's life was in danger.\"  \"What of that?\"  \"Every thing, I should say.\"  \"Did he give you any thing?\"  \"Yes;\" and Bobby continued his walk down to the river's side.  \"I say, what did he give you, Bobby?\" persisted Tom, following him.  \"O, he gave me a good deal of money.\"  \"How much?\"  \"I want to get my fish line now; I will tell you all about it some other time,\" replied Bobby, who rather suspected the intentions of his companion.  \"Tell me now; how much was it?\"  \"Never mind it now.\"  \"Humph!  Do you think I mean to rob you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Ain't you going halveses?\"  \"Why should I?\"  \"Wasn't I with you?\"  \"Were you?\"  \"Wasn't I fishing with you?\"  \"You did not do any thing about stopping the horse.\"  \"I"]]]
