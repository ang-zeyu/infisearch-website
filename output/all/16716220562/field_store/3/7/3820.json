Elsie sprang to her side with a kindly, eager, \"Let me do it, won't you?\"  It was done in a trice and the girl thanked her with lips and eyes.  \"It often takes me full five or ten minutes,\" she said, \"and sometimes I have to get mother to do it for me.\"  \"What a pity! it must be a great hindrance to your work.\"  \"Yes, indeed, and my eyes ache so that I can seldom sew or read for more than an hour or two at a time. Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to lose my sight altogether.\"  The tone was inexpressibly mournful, and Elsie's eyes filled again.  \"Don't fret about it,\" she said, \"I think--I hope you can be cured.\"  The rain had nearly ceased, and Philip, saying the worst was over, and they were in danger of being late at dinner, hurried the girls into the phaeton.  \"What was that woman whispering to you?\" asked Gertrude, as soon as they were fairly off.  Elsie looked uncomfortable. \"It was something I was to tell mamma,\" she replied.  \"But what is it?\"  \"I'm afraid she wanted to keep it a secret from you, Gerty, or she would have spoken out loud.\"  \"I think you're very mean and disobliging,\" retorted Gertrude, beginning to pout.  \"No, she isn't,\" said Philip pompously, \"she's honorable, and one of the few females who can keep a secret. But I overheard it, Elsie, and feel pretty sure that the reason she whispered it, was to keep the poor girl from hearing. It's very natural she shouldn't want her to know she's afraid her sight's leaving her.\"  \"Oh, yes; I suppose that was it!\" returned Elsie. \"But you were very wise to think of it, Phil.\"  \"Don't flatter him,\" said Gertrude; \"he thinks a great deal too much of himself, already.\"  Dinner was just ready when they reached home, and their mammas were on the porch looking for them.  \"So there you are at last! what detained you so long?\" said Mrs. Ross.  \"Went further than we intended; and then the rain, you know,\" said Philip.  \"And, oh, we had an adventure!\" cried the girls, and hastened to tell it.  Mrs. Travilla had not forgotten her old governess, and though no pleasant recollection of her lingered in her memory, neither was there any dislike or revengeful feeling there. She heard of her sorrows with commiseration and rejoiced in the ability to alleviate them.  \"That Mrs. Gibson!\" exclaimed Lucy, \"I've seen her many a time at the door or window, in driving past, and have often thought there was something familiar in her face, but never dreamed who she was. That hateful Miss Day! as I used to call her; Elsie, I wouldn't do a thing for her, if I were you. Why she treated you with absolute cruelty.\"  \"She was sometimes unjust and unkind,\" said Mrs. Travilla, smiling at her friend's vehemence, \"but probably my sensitiveness, timidity and stupidity, were often very trying.\"  \"No such thing!--if you will excuse me for contradicting you--everybody that knew you then, would testify that you were the sweetest, dearest, most patient, industrious little thing that ever was made.\"  Elsie laughed and shook her head, \"Ah, Lucy, you always flattered me; never were jealous even when I was held up to you as a pattern an evidence that yours was a remarkably sweet disposition. Now, tell me, please, if you know anything about these Gibsons?\"  \"Not much; they came to that hut years ago, evidently very poor, and quite as evidently--so report says--having seen better days. The husband and father drank deeply, and the wife earned a scanty support for the family by sewing and knitting; that is about all I know of them, except that several of their children died of scarlet fever within a few days of each other, soon after they came to the neighborhood, and that a year ago last winter, the man, coming home very drunk, fell into a snow-drift, and next day was found frozen to death. I was told at that time they had only two children--a son who was following in his father's footsteps, and this daughter.\"  \"Poor woman!\" sighed Elsie, \"she is sorely tried and afflicted. I must go to her at once.\"  \"Do, mamma, and get a doctor for her,\" said little Elsie; \"she looked so sick and miserable.\"  Mrs. Ross offered her carriage, and the shower having cooled the air, Elsie went, shortly after the conclusion of the meal.     CHAPTER NINTH.           \"I'll not chide thee;     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.\"                                    --SHAKESPEARE.   \"I never saw such a likeness in my life!\" said Mrs. Gibson looking after the phaeton as it drove away; \"she's the very image of her mother. I could just have believed it was the very little Elsie Dinsmore I used to teach more than twenty years ago.\"  \"She's lovely!\" exclaimed Sally with enthusiasm. \"Mother, did you see what a pretty watch she had?\"  \"Yes,\" gloomily; \"some folks seem to have nothing but prosperity, and others nothing but poverty and losses and crosses. They're as rich as Croesus and we have hardly enough to keep us from starving.\"  \"Better times may come,\" said Sally, trying to speak hopefully, \"Tom may reform and go to work. I do think, mother, if you'd try to----\"  \"Hush! I'm a great deal better to him than he deserves.\"  It was some moments before Sally spoke again, then it was only to ask, \"Will you have your dinner now, mother?\"  \"No; there's nothing in the house but bread and potatoes, and I couldn't swallow either. Dear me what a table they used to set at Roselands! enough to tempt the appetite of an epicure.\"  \"I must rest my eyes a little. I can't see any longer,\" said the girl, laying down her work and going to the door.  \"It's just dreadful,\" sighed her mother, \"but don't get out of heart; these people will help us and it is possible some skilful oculist may understand your case and be able to help you.\"  The girl's eyes were fixed upon the distant mountain-tops where, through a rift in the clouds the sun shone suddenly out for a moment. \"'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills whence cometh my help,'\" she murmured softly to herself. Then from a full heart went up a strong cry, \"O God, my Father, save me, I beseech thee, from this bitter trial that I so dread! Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. Oh, help me to be content with whatsoever thou shalt send!\"  \"Sally, you're standing there a long time.\" It was the mother's querulous voice again.  The girl turned toward her, answering in a patient tone. \"Yes, mother, it rests my eyes to look at the sky and the mountains or any distant object.\"  \"You'd better get yourself something to eat. It must be six or eight hours at least since breakfast.\"  An hour later Sally, again busied with her sewing, by the window, lifted her head at the sound of wheels and exclaimed in a low tone, \"There is the same carriage again! It has stopped and a lady is getting out of it.\"  But turning her head she perceived that her mother, who was now lying on the bed, had fallen asleep. Dropping her work, she stepped quickly to the door in time to prevent a rap.  She recognized the lady at once from her likeness to her namesake daughter, and holding out her hand with a joyful admiring smile said, \"Mrs. Travilla, is it not? Thank you for coming. I am so glad, and mother will be so delighted to see you; but she is sleeping just now.\"  She had spoken softly, and Elsie answered in the same subdued tone, as she took the offered hand, then stepped in and sat down in a chair the girl hastened to set for her, \"That is well; we must not wake her.\"  A long talk followed in which Elsie by her ready tact and sweet sympathy, free from the slightest approach to patronage, drew from the girl the story of their sorrows, privations and fears for the future.  Her mother had been gradually failing for some time, though she really did not know what was the nature of the disease. For a while they had contrived by their united efforts to make the two ends meet, but now that all depended upon her, with her poor sight, it was no longer possible.  \"How are your eyes affected?\" asked Elsie.  \"The sight is dim; I can scarcely see to set my stitches: I have great difficulty in threading a needle: I always had. I could never read fine print, never read through a long sentence without shutting my eyes for an instant or looking off the book. It has always been an effort to see, and now I am forced to use my eyes so constantly they grow worse and pain me very much. At times a mist comes over them so that I cannot see at all until I rest them a little. Indeed I often seem to be going blind and I'm afraid I shall,\" she added, with a tremble in her tones, a tear rolling down her cheek. But she hastily wiped it away.  \"My poor child, I hope not,\" Elsie said, laying a hand softly on hers; \"there have been wonderful cures of diseased eyes. You must go to an oculist.\"  \"The expense would be far beyond our means.\"  \"You must let me assume that. No, don't shake your head. I have abundant means. The Lord has given me far more of this world's goods than I ought to use for myself or my family and I know it is because he would have me be his almoner.\"  The girl wept for joy and thankfulness.  \"Oh, how kind you are!\" she cried. \"I believe the Lord sent you and that my sight will be spared; for I have prayed so that it might;--that he would send me help somehow. But mother, how can she do without me?\"  \"I will see that she has medical advice, nursing, everything she needs.\"  Sally tried to speak her thanks but tears and sobs came instead.  The sound woke Mrs. Gibson. \"Elsie Dinsmore!\" she cried in feeble but excited tones, with difficulty raising herself to a sitting posture. \"I should have known you anywhere.\"  \"I cannot say the same; you are much changed,\" Elsie said, going to the bedside and taking the thin feverish hand in hers.  \"Yes, I've grown an old woman, while you are fresh and young; and no wonder, for your life has been all prosperity; mine nothing but trouble and trial from beginning to end.\"  \"O, mother dear, we have had a great many mercies,\" said Sally; \"and your life is not ended.

THE LAST STAND              355      THE FOREST RUNNERS      CHAPTER I  PAUL   Paul stopped in a little open space, and looked around all the circle of the forest. Everywhere it was the same--just the curving wall of red and brown, and beyond, the blue sky, flecked with tiny clouds of white. The wilderness was full of beauty, charged with the glory of peace and silence, and there was naught to indicate that man had ever come. The leaves rippled a little in the gentle west wind, and the crisping grass bowed before it; but Paul saw no living being, save himself, in the vast, empty world.  The boy was troubled and, despite his life in the woods, he had full right to be. This was the great haunted forest of _Kain-tuck-ee_, where the red man made his most desperate stand, and none ever knew when or whence danger would come. Moreover, he was lost, and the forest told him nothing; he was not like his friend, Henry Ware, born to the forest, the heir to all the primeval instincts, alive to every sight and sound, and able to read the slightest warning the wilderness might give. Paul Cotter was a student, a lover of books, and a coming statesman. Fate, it seemed, had chosen that he and Henry Ware should go hand in hand, but for different tasks.  Paul gazed once more around the circle of the glowing forest, and the shadow in his eyes deepened. Henry and the horses, loaded with powder for the needy settlement, must be somewhere near, but whether to right or left he could not tell. He had gone to look for water, and when he undertook to return he merely went deeper and deeper into the forest. Now the boughs, as they nodded before the gentle breeze, seemed to nod to him in derision. He felt shame as well as alarm. Henry would not laugh at him, but the born scholar would be worth, for the time, at least, far less than the born trailer.  Yet no observer, had there been any, would have condemned Paul as he condemned himself. He stood there, a tall, slender boy, with a broad, high brow, white like a girl's above the line of his cap, blue eyes, dark and full, with the width between that indicates the mind behind, and the firm, pointed chin that belongs so often to people of intellect.  Paul and Henry were on their way from Wareville, their home, with horses hearing powder for Marlowe, the nearest settlement, nearly a hundred miles away. The secret of making powder from the nitre dust on the floors of the great caves of Kentucky had been discovered by the people of Wareville, and now they wished to share their unfailing supply with others, in order that the infant colony might be able to withstand Indian attacks. Henry Ware, once a captive in a far Northwestern tribe, and noted for his great strength and skill, had been chosen, with Paul Cotter, his comrade, to carry it. Both rejoiced in the great task, which to them meant the saving of Kentucky.  Paul's eyes were apt at times to have a dreamy look, as if he were thinking of things far away, whether of time or place; but now they were alive to the present, and to the forest about him. He listened intently. At last he lay down and put his ear to the earth, as he had seen Henry do; but he heard nothing save a soft, sighing sound, which he knew to be only the note of the wilderness. He might have fired his rifle. The sharp, lashing report would go far, carried farther by its own echoes; but it was more likely to bring foe than friend, and he refrained.  But he must try, if not one thing, then another. He looked up at the heavens and studied the great, red globe of the sun, now going slowly down the western arch in circles of crimson and orange light, and then he looked hack at the earth. If he had not judged the position of the sun wrong, their little camp lay to the right, and he would choose that course. He turned at once and walked swiftly among the trees.  Paul stopped now and then to listen. He would have uttered the long forest shout, as a signal to his comrade, but even that was forbidden. Henry had seen signs in the forest that indicated more than once to his infallible eye the presence of roving warriors from the north, and no risk must be taken. But, as usual, it was only the note of the wilderness that came to his ears. He stopped also once or twice, not to listen, but to look at the splendid country, and to think what a great land it would surely be.  He walked steadily on for miles, but the region about him remained unfamiliar. No smoke from the little camp-fire rose among the trees, and no welcome sight of Henry or the horses came to his eyes. For all he knew, he might be going farther from the camp at every step. Putting aside caution, he made a trumpet of his two hands, and uttered the long, quavering cry that serves as a signal in the forest. It came back in a somber echo from the darkening wilderness, and Paul saw, with a little shiver, that the sun was now going down behind the trees. The breeze rose, and the leaves rustled together with a soft hiss, like a warning. Chill came into the air. The sensitive mind of the boy, so much alive to abstract impressions, felt the omens of coming danger, and he stopped again, not knowing what to do. He called himself afraid, but he was not. It was the greater tribute to his courage that he remained resolute where another might well have been in despair.  The sun went down behind the black forest like a cannon shot into the sea, and darkness swept over the wilderness. Paul uttered the long cry again and again, but, as before, no answer came back; once he fired his rifle, and the sharp note seemed to run for miles, but still no answer.  Then he decided to take counsel of prudence, and sleep where he was. If he walked on, he might go farther and farther away from the camp, but if he stopped now, while he might not find Henry, Henry would certainly find him. Any wilderness trail was an open road to his comrade.  He hunted a soft place under one of the trees, and, despising the dew, stretched himself between two giant roots, his rifle by his side. He was tired and hungry, and he lay for a while staring at the blank undergrowth, but by and by all his troubles and doubts floated away. The note of the wind was soothing, and the huge roots sheltered him. His eyelids drooped, a singular feeling of peace and ease crept over him, and he was asleep.  It was yet the intense darkness of early night, and the outline of his figure was lost between the giant roots, but after a while a silver moon brought a gray tint to the skies, and the black bank over the forest began to thin and lighten. Then two figures, hideous in paint, crept from the undergrowth, and stared at the sleeping boy with pitiless eyes.  Paul slept on, and mercifully knew nothing of his danger; yet it would have been hard to find in the world two pairs of eyes that contained more savagery than those now gazing upon him. Their owners crept nearer, looking with fierce joy through the darkness at the sleeping boy who was so certainly their prey. Their code contained nothing that taught them to spare a foe, and this youth. In the van of the white invasion, was the worst of foes.  The boy still slept, and his slumber was deep, sweet, and dreamless. No"]]]
