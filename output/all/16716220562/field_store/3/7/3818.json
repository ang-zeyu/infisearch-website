Indeed we will! Mamma, coax him!\"  \"Yes, do let them have them, Phil,\" urged his wife, \"where would be the use of keeping the things back after spending your money for them?\"  \"To teach them a good lesson. I'm afraid both you and I are foolishly indulgent, Lucy.\"  \"Oh, they'll be good next time.\"  \"This once then, but only this once, unless they keep their word,\" he said, producing his gifts--a book or toy for each of his own children, and a package of sweetmeats which he divided among all present.  He had brought a new dog home with him, but no one but Eddie had noticed it yet. He was stroking and patting it, saying, \"Poor fellow, what kind of a dog are you?\"  \"A French poodle,\" said Mr. Ross, coming up to them, \"A good watch dog, and excellent for scaring up the wild ducks for the sportsmen. Do you and papa keep up the shooting lessons, master Eddie?\"  \"Yes, sir; papa has always said he meant to make me as good a shot as himself, and mamma says it was never his way to give up till a thing's thoroughly done,\" returned the boy, proudly.  \"And you don't equal him as a shot yet, eh?\"  \"No, sir! no, indeed! Why, even cousin Cal Conly--a big man--can't shoot as well as papa.\"  \"What an ugly dog!\" exclaimed the other children, gathering round.  \"What did you buy it for, papa?\" asked Gertrude.  \"Not for beauty, certainly,\" laughed Mr. Ross, stroking and patting the shaggy head of the dog, who was covered with curly hair of a dirty white, mottled with dull brown, \"but for worth which is far better. Isn't it, Ranger?\"  A wag of his bushy tail, was Ranger's only reply.  \"Will he bite?\" asked little Herbert, shrinking back as the newcomer turned toward him.  \"Tramps and burglars; but not good children,\" replied Mr. Ross. \"You needn't be afraid of him, my little man.\"  Through the evening there was a great deal of romping between the children and the new dog, but little Elsie seemed unusually quiet, scarcely stirring from her mother's side. She was suffering with toothache, but kept her trouble to herself; principally, because she had a great dread of the dentist's instruments.  But in the night the pain grew so severe that she could not keep from crying and groaning. She did not want to wake any one, so buried her face in the pillow to smother the sound of her sobs; but presently a gentle hand touched her caressingly, and mamma's sweet voice asked, \"What ails my little daughter?\"  \"O mamma I did not mean to wake you!\" cried the little girl sitting up with her hand pressed to her cheek, \"but the pain was so bad I couldn't help making a noise.\"  \"My poor dear little girl! did you think your mother would want to sleep when her child was in pain?\" Elsie said, clasping her in her arms. \"No, indeed! so do not try to bear any pain alone another time.\"  Mamma's loving sympathy was very sweet; the pain was soon relieved, too, by some medicine she put into the tooth, and presently all was forgotten in sound refreshing sleep.  Elsie came into her mamma's dressing-room the next morning, along with the others, looking as bright and well as was her wont, yet with the boding fear that something would be said to her about having the troublesome tooth extracted.  However to her relief the subject was not broached at all; they had their usual reading and prayer, recitation of texts and talk with mamma about the lessons contained in them, and then the breakfast bell summoned them to their morning meal.  The tooth was quiet for a few days, then ached again for several hours harder than ever.  \"O mamma, mamma, what shall I do?\" sobbed the child in the midst of her pain.  \"Couldn't my little girl pluck up courage enough to have it out?\" asked the mother tenderly.  \"O mamma, don't say I must! please don't; I'm so frightened at the very thought!\"  \"Ah, if I could only bear it for you, my darling! but you know I cannot.\"  \"No, dear mamma, and I couldn't be so selfish as to let you, if you could. But must I have it out?\"  \"I have not said so; I should far rather my dear daughter would say must to herself.\"  \"Ought I, mamma?\"  \"Ought you not? The tooth has become only a source of pain and trouble to you; if left it will cause the others to decay, and decayed teeth injure the health. Health is one of God's best gifts and it is our duty to use every means in our power to preserve it.\"  \"Yes, mamma, but oh, I'm so afraid!\" cried the child, trembling and weeping.  \"My darling, resolve to do your duty with God's help, and he will fulfill his promise to you. 'As thy days so shall thy strength be.'\"  Little Elsie had long ago given her heart to Jesus; love to him was the ruling motive of her life, and to please and honor him she was ready to do or endure anything. \"I will try, mamma,\" she said, \"and you too will ask God to help me?\"  Mamma gave the promise, sealing it with a very tender kiss.  Mr. Ross was going down to New York the next morning, and it was soon arranged that his wife, Mrs. Travilla and little Elsie, should accompany him.  Mrs. Ross had some shopping to do, but would first take the two Elsies to her dentist, so that the little girl's trial might be over as soon as possible and she able to enjoy some sight-seeing afterward. Baby Lily was better and could be safely entrusted for the day to Aunt Chloe's faithful care.  The plan was concealed from the Ross children because, as their mother said, \"it was the only way to have any peace.\" So they were allowed to sleep until the travelers had taken an early breakfast and gone.  The little Travillas, however, were up and saw the departure, bidding a cheerful good-bye to \"mamma and sister Elsie,\" sending wistful, longing looks after the carriage as it rolled away, but making no complaint that they were left behind.  \"Poor dear Elsie!\" Vi said with tears in her eyes, \"it's just dreadful that she must have that tooth extricated.\"  \"Extracted,\" corrected Eddie. \"Vi, you seem to forget what mamma says:--that you should never use a big word unless you are sure you have it right; or when a little one would do as well.\"  \"What little one?\"  \"Pulled.\"  \"Couldn't it be pulled and not come out?\"  \"Well then you might say pulled out.\"  \"I like the other word best,\" persisted Vi. \"But we needn't be particular about words when Elsie's going to be so dreadfully hurt.\"  Herbert burst out crying at that.  \"Why Herbie what ails you?\" asked Vi, putting her arms round his neck and giving him a kiss.  \"I don't want the mans to hurt my Elsie,\" sobbed the little fellow, \"maybe dey'll kill her.\"  \"Oh, no, they won't! mamma will never let them do that. They'll only take away the naughty tooth that hurts her so.\"  \"Come let's go and walk round the garden,\" said Eddie, taking Herbie's hand, \"mamma said we might.\"  The breakfast bell called them in to find the Rosses making a perfect bedlam in their anger and disappointment at being left behind by their parents. Sophie was screaming and stamping with rage, the boys and Kate were whimpering and scolding, and Gertrude walking about with flashing eyes, was saying \"I'll never forgive mamma for this, no I never will; for she'd promised to take me along next time she went to the city.\"  Violet, Eddie, and Harold hearing these words, looked at each other in horrified silence. \"How could she speak so of her own mother?\"  Miss Fisk came in, in her quiet, deliberate way and stood looking for a moment from one to another of her pupils in a sort of amazed, reproving silence that presently had the effect of quieting them down a little. Then she spoke.  \"Young ladies and young gentlemen, I am astonished! especially at your expressions and behavior, Miss Gertrude Ross. How you can permit yourself to indulge in such invectives against parents so extremely indulgent as Mr. and Mrs. Ross, I cannot conceive.\"  Sophie whose screams had sunk to sobs, now permitted the servant to lift her to her high chair, Kate and the boys slunk shamefacedly into their seats at the table, and Gertrude, muttering something about \"people not keeping their promises,\" followed their example.  \"Come, sit down, my dears,\" Miss Fisk said, turning to Violet and her brothers; \"the tempest seems to have nearly subsided and I hope will not resume its violence.\"  Herbie was clinging to Vi in a frightened way, sobbing \"I want mamma!\" and Harold's eyes too were full of tears. It took coaxing and soothing to restore their equanimity and then the breakfast proceeded, everybody seeming to grow brighter and more good humored with the satisfying of the appetite for food.  Vi was a merry little creature, a veritable bit of sunshine wherever she went, and under the influence of her bright looks and ways, sweet rippling laughter and amusing speeches, the whole party at length grew quite merry: especially after Miss Fisk had announced that there were to be no lessons that day but instead a picnic in the woods.     CHAPTER SIXTH.      \"By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd,      The sports of children satisfy the child.\"                                           --GOLDSMITH.    \"Good! good!\" cried the children. \"Oh, delightful! But where are we going?\"  \"To the grove adjacent to the schoolhouse,\" replied the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],["title","Elsie's children (#5)"],["body",". \"We could not find a lovelier spot, and its proximity to the mansion renders it most eligible.\"  \"'Proximity, eligible, adjacent;' what do you mean by those words, Miss Fisk?\" asked Gertrude, a little contemptuously.  \"I desire you to consult one of our standard lexicographers. You will then be far more likely to retain the definitions in your memory,\" returned the governess, ignoring the tone of her pupil.  Gertrude shrugged her shoulders, with impatience, muttering audibly, \"I wish you'd talk like other people, and not like a dictionary.\"  \"You quarrel with my phraseology, because you do not understand it,\" observed Miss Fisk, nonchalantly, \"which is very irrational, since were I never to employ, in conversing with you, words beyond your comprehension, you would lose the advantage of being induced to increase your stock of information by a search for their meaning.\"  \"If that's what you do it for, you may as well give it up at once,\" returned Gertrude, \"for I don't care enough about your meaning to take half that trouble.\"  \"Miss Gertrude, permit me to remark that you are lacking in respect to your instructress,\" returned Miss Fisk, reddening.  \"Do you mean that it is convenient, because of being so near this house, Miss Fisk?\" asked Eddie respectfully.  \"Yes, convenient and safe; on which account both Mrs. Travilla and Mrs. Ross stipulated that our picnic for to-day should be held there.\"  \"Well, let's go right away,\" said Gertrude, jumping up and pushing back her chair.  \"Immediately, Miss Ross,\" corrected the governess. \"Right away is exceedingly inelegant.\"  \"How tiresome!\" muttered Gertrude. Then aloud to Violet, as the governess left the room, \"I say, Vi, does your mamma reprove you for saying right away?\"  \"I don't remember that I ever said it. Mamma----\"  \"Said it?\" interrupted Gertrude, with a twinkle of fun in her eye, \"why don't you say 'used the expression'? my dear,\" mimicking Miss Fisk's tones, \"you should never condescend to make use of a sixpenny word, when a fifty cent one would express your sentiments fully as correctly, or perchance even more so.\"  Vi could not help joining in the laugh with which Gertrude concluded, though feeling rather ashamed of herself, as she seemed to see the grave look of disapproval mamma would have given her if present.  \"Oh, Gertrude,\" she said, \"we oughtn't to----\"  \"Yes, we ought,\" returned Gertrude, as they ran out of the room together; \"mamma always laughs when I take off old finikin Fisk. She wouldn't have me talk like her for the world. Would your mamma wish you to?\"  \"No, but she never says----\"  \"Right away? No, of course not; she says 'immediately' or 'at once' or something that sounds nice. Well, so will I when I'm grown up.\"  Miss Fisk was on the porch taking an observation of the weather, the children crowding about her, and clamoring to be allowed to set out immediately for the grove. The day was fine, and there seemed every indication that it would continue so.  \"Yes,\" said the governess, \"you may request your maids to see that you are suitably arrayed for the occasion, and as promptly as possible, and we will repair to the appointed place; taking our departure hence in precisely thirty minutes.\"  The children were ready and impatiently waiting, when Miss Fisk came down from her room, \"suitably arrayed for the occasion.\"  They set out at once, the whole party in high good humor, the boys carrying their balls, marbles, and fishing rods, the girls their dolls and a set of toy dishes, to play tea-party with. Miss Fisk had a bit of fancy work and a book, and two servants brought up the rear with camp-chairs, an afghan and rugs to make a couch for the little ones when they should grow sleepy. Luncheon was in course of preparation by the cook, and was to be sent by the time the young picnickers were likely to feel an appetite for it.  The boys took the lead, bounding on some distance ahead, with Ranger in their midst. They were in no mood just then for sitting still, so depositing their fishing tackle in the schoolhouse, went roving about in search of more active amusement than that of catching trout.  \"That'll be good fun when we want to sit down and rest,\" said Eddie.  \"Oh, I see a bird's nest, and I'm going to have it!\" exclaimed Archie, beginning to climb a tree.  \"Oh don't,\" cried Harold, \"mamma says it's very cruel and wicked to rob the poor little birds.\"  \"Pooh! you're a baby!\" answered Archie, half breathlessly, pulling himself up higher and yet higher. \"There, I'll have it in a minute,\" reaching out his hand to lay hold of the branch that held the nest.  Ranger was barking loudly at the foot of the tree, Harry and Eddie were calling to Archie to \"Take care!\" and he hardly knew how it was himself, but he missed the branch, lost his hold of the tree, and fell, lighting upon Ranger's back.  The boy gave a scream, the dog a yelp, and the rest of the party came running to ask what was the matter.  Archie picked himself up, looking quite crestfallen, and the fright of the others was turned to laughter, as they discovered that he had received no damage beyond a slight scratch on his hand and a rent in his jacket.  Miss Fisk, making him promise not to repeat the experiment, went back to her seat under the trees and the book she had brought from the house for her own enjoyment.  The morning passed without any further incident worth recording, the children amusing themselves with various quiet plays, the girls keeping house, each under her own particular tree, and exchanging visits; the boys catching trout, which they sent to the house to be cooked for dinner. They wanted to make a fire and cook them themselves, but Miss Fisk wisely forbade it.  She would have had the meal served in the schoolhouse, but yielded to the clamor for an out-door repast. Several desks were brought out into the shade of the trees, a dainty table-cloth spread over them and the party presently sat down to a delightful collation, to which they brought keen appetites.  Ranger had disappeared. They missed him as they were leaving the table.  \"Where can he have gone?\" Harry was saying, when Vi cried out, \"Oh yonder he is! and he has a dear little bird in his mouth! Oh you wicked, cruel dog!\" And running to him she tried to take it from him.  Be dropped it and snapped at her, Eddie jerking her back just in time to save her from his teeth, while Archie, who was very fond of Vi, struck the dog a blow with a stick, crying furiously, \"You just do that again, sir, and I'll kill you!\"  Ranger then flew at him, but the boy avoided the attack by jumping nimbly behind a tree.  The other children were screaming with fright, and a catastrophe appeared imminent, but one of the maids came running with some tempting morsels for Ranger which appeased his wrath, and the danger was averted.  Ranger's attention being absorbed with the satisfying of his appetite, the children now looked about for the bird. It was not quite dead, but soon breathed its last in Vi's lap with her tears dropping fast upon it.  \"Oh don't, Vi!\" said Archie, \"I can't bear to see you feel so sorry. And the bird isn't being hurt now, you know; 'twon't ever be hurt any more; will it, Ed?\"  \"No,\" said Harry, \"we might as well let the dog have it.\"  \"No, no!\" said Eddie, \"it would just encourage him to catch another.\"  \"So it would,\" said Gertrude, \"let's make a grand funeral and bury it at the foot of a tree. If we only knew now which one it used to live on.\"  The motion was about to be carried by acclamation, but Vi entered a decided protest. \"No, no, I want to keep it.\"  \"But you can't, Vi,\" remonstrated Eddie, \"dead things have to be buried, you know.\"  \"Not the skin and feathers, Eddie; they do stuff them sometimes and I'll ask mamma to let me have this one done.\"  \"Oh what's the use?\" expostulated Gertrude; \"it's only a common robin.\"  \"But I love it; the poor dear little thing! and mamma will let me, I know she will,\" returned Vi, wiping away her tears as though comforted by the very thought.  The other children wandered off to their play leaving her sitting where she was, on a fallen tree, fondling the bird; but Archie soon came back and seated himself by her side.  \"Such a pity; isn't it?\" he said, \"I hate that Ranger, don't you, Vi?\"  \"No-o I hope not, Archie,\" she answered doubtfully: \"folks kill birds to eat them and may be 'tain't any worse for dogs,\" she added, with a fresh burst of tears. \"Poor little birdie; and may be there are some young ones in the nest that have no mamma now to feed or care for them.\"  \"That old Ranger! and he snapped at you too. Here he comes again. I'll kill him!\" cried the boy, with vehemence. \"Oh no, I know what I'll do! Here Ranger! here Ranger!\" and starting up he rushed away in a direction to take him farther from the schoolhouse and the rest of his party.  He had spied in the distance a farmer's boy, a lad of fourteen, with whom he had some slight acquaintance. \"Hallo, Jared Bates!\" he shouted.  \"Well, what's wantin'?\" and Jared stood still, drawing the lash of his carter's whip slowly between his fingers. \"Hurry up now, for I've got to go back to my team. Whose dog's that?\" as Ranger came running up and saluted him with a sharp, \"Bow, wow, wow!\"  \"Ours,\" said Archie, \"and I'm mad at him 'cause he killed a bird and tried to bite Vi Travilla, when she went to take it from him.\"  \"Like enough,\" returned Jared, grinning. \"But what about it?\"  \"I thought may be you'd like to have him.\"  \"So I would, what'll you sell him for?\"  \"Ten cents.\"  \"I hain't got but two.\"  \"Haven't you, Jared? truly, now?\"  \"No, nary red, 'cept them,\" and diving into his pantaloons' pocket, Jared produced a handful of odds and ends--a broken knife, a plug of tobacco, some rusty nails, a bit of twine, etc.,--from which he picked out two nickels. \"There, them's um, and they's all I got in the world,\" he said gravely, passing them over to Archie.  \"Well, it's very cheap,\" observed the latter, pocketing the cash, \"but"]]]
