They were too wet and cold to stay here,\" replied Frank. \"You can return in our boat.\"  \"The gentleman wants to see Tony very much.\"  \"Who is he?\"  \"His name is Walker; it would do your heart good to hear him speak of Tony.\"  \"I dare say; but Tony is worthy of all the praise that can be bestowed upon him. How is the lady?\"  \"She is nicely, and _she_ thinks Tony is an angel. She declares that a dozen strong men could have done no more for them.\"  \"She is right; you did all that could have been done by any persons. The Butterfly's first laurel is a glorious one, and I can congratulate you on the honors you have won.\"  \"Thank you, Frank,\" said Little Paul, modestly. \"I am sorry you were not with us to share the honors.\"  \"We should have been, if it hadn't been for Tim Bunker,\" said Charles Hardy, a little sourly.  Tim had gone with the Butterfly, or Charles would not have dared to make such a remark.  \"And if you had had your way, we shouldn't have come when we did,\" added William Bright, smartly.  \"What do you mean, Bill?\"  \"Didn't you protest against passing the rocks.\"  \"I did, because it was directly in opposition to Captain Sedley's orders.\"  \"Never mind, fellows,\" interposed Frank; \"for my part, I am glad the Butterfly had it all to herself. She has just come out, and it will be a feather in her cap.\"  \"But we saved the chaise,\" said Charles.  \"We pulled it ashore; it was safe enough where it was. The Butterfly saved the lives of the man and woman, and of the horse. They would have drowned, and all the glory consisted in saving them. Tony and his crew deserve all the credit, and I, for one, am happy to accord it to them.\"  \"That's just like you, Frank!\" exclaimed Little Paul. \"I believe, if the two boats had changed places, you would have given us all the credit.\"  \"You behaved nobly.\"  \"Just as you would have done if you had been in Tony's place.\"  \"We will talk that over some other time. We are ready to return when you are.\"  \"I suppose there is nothing more to be done.\"  They were about to embark, when they discovered a party of men approaching the place, several of them carrying ropes and poles.  \"Hold on;\" shouted Farmer Leeds, to whose house the boys had conducted the lady and gentleman. \"We want your boat to get the chaise out of the river with.\"  \"It is out now,\" replied Little Paul.  The boys waited till the party reached the river. A clump of trees had prevented them from seeing the chaise till they had got almost to the shore; and, as Little Paul expressed it afterwards, \"they looked surprised enough, to see it high and dry upon the rocks.\"  \"I must say one thing, Mr. Leeds,\" began Mr. Walker; \"and that is, you have smart boys in this vicinity.\"  \"Toler'ble,\" replied the farmer, with a smile.  \"They are men in noble deeds.\"  \"This boating business turns the boys into men; and though, in my opinion, it would be just as well to set 'em to work in the cornfields, there is no denying that it brings 'em out, and makes 'em smart.\"  \"My wife would certainly have been drowned without their help.\"  \"I daresay.\"  \"But where is the little fellow that commanded the boat?\" asked Mr. Walker, scrutinizing the faces of the boys.  \"He has gone home, sir; he was wet and cold.\"  \"That is right; I am glad he has; I shall go and see him by and by. And these are the boys that brought the chaise ashore?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Little Paul. \"This is Frank Sedley, the coxswain of the Zephyr.\"  \"Well, Master Sedley, I am under great obligations to you.\"  \"Not at all to me, sir. Tony Weston saved you. We only pulled the chaise ashore.\"  \"But you shall not be forgotten. The other boat is gone, you say?\"  \"Yes, sir. Tony Weston is the coxswain of the Butterfly.\"  \"And a noble fellow he is, too. He will be a great man one of these days. It did my heart good to see how cool and collected he was; how skilfully he managed the boat, when it came down upon us like a race horse. He gave off his orders like a hero, and they were obeyed with a promptness and precision that would have been creditable to the crew of a man-of-war, after a three years' cruise. And then, when he ordered six of the boys to stay in the boat, and the rest to follow him into the water, it was really heroic. Over he went, with his crew after him, as though they had been so many ducks. And in the water, they worked with as much coolness and courage as though it had been their native element. I would give half my fortune to be the father of such a son.\"  \"I would give all of mine,\" added Farmer Leeds. \"You don't know half his worth yet. But there is nothing for us to do here; the men shall haul your chaise up to the house, and as we walk along I will tell you about Tony.\"  \"Master Sedley, I shall see you again to-day or to-morrow. Tell Tony how highly I value his noble service, and tell him I shall call upon him this evening,\" said Mr. Walker, as he went away with Farmer Leeds.  \"My father would be very happy to have you stop at his house while you remain in Rippleton,\" continued Frank, who was not sure that the farmhouse would accommodate him.  \"As to that,\" interposed Farmer Leeds, \"I can't offer you so grand a house as Captain Sedley's, but such as it is, you are welcome to it.\"  \"Thank you, Master Sedley, for your hospitable invitation; but I think I will remain with my good friend here.\" And he departed with the farmer.  \"All aboard!\" said Frank, and the boys tumbled into the boat, and grasped their oars.  The Zephyr pushed off, and her cheerful crew pulled merrily down the river. Frank was conscious that the organization of the boat clubs had been the means of accomplishing the good work which the crew of the Butterfly had just achieved. He was aware that some of the people in the vicinity had cherished strong objections to the clubs, and that Tony had had considerable difficulty in persuading the parents of his crew to allow their sons to join. The adventure at the bridge, he thought, would have a tendency to reconcile them, and to elevate and dignify boating. At any rate a good deed had been done, and the parents of those who had taken part in it could not but be proud of the laurels their sons had earned.  The Zephyr, under Frank's skilful pilotage passed the rocks in safety, though, as they darted through the narrow channel, he could see their sharp edges only a little way below the surface of the clear water.  They had scarcely entered the open lake before they perceived the Sylph, under full sail with a smashing breeze, close aboard of them.  \"Frank!\" shouted Captain Sedley, who was at the helm, while Uncle Ben was gazing at them with a very sorrowful face from the half deck.  \"Ay, ay, sir!\" replied Frank, as he laid the Zephyr's course towards the sailboat.  Though his father had only spoken his name, there was something in the tone which could not be misapprehended; but it did not occur to him, he was so engaged in thinking of the incidents at the bridge, that he had disobeyed his father's command in passing into the river.  As the Zephyr approached, the Sylph luffed, and came up into the wind, to wait for her. Frank brought his boat round under the stern of the sailboat, and \"lay to\" an oar's length from her.  \"Frank,\" said his father, sternly, \"I am surprised that you should venture among those rocks, when I have expressly forbidden you ever to go into the river.\"  \"But, father, there was--\"  \"How could you do such a thing, after I had so carefully warned you--so positively interdicted it? Suppose your boat had been dashed in pieces,\" continued Captain Sedley, who, though deeply grieved at his son's apparent disobedience, was too indignant to hear an excuse; for such he supposed Frank was about to offer--one of those silly, frivolous excuses which boys sometimes seize upon to palliate their misconduct.  \"I protested against it!\" said Charles Hardy, rising from his seat.  \"Shut up!\" exclaimed Little Paul, his cheek glowing with indignation, as he pulled Charles back into his seat.  \"I went to save life, father,\" replied Frank, almost choked by his emotions, a flood of tears springing in his eyes and well-nigh blinding him.  \"To save life!\" said Captain Sedley, touched by the reply, and far more by Frank's emotion.  He saw that he had spoken too quick--that his son had not passed the rocks without a good and sufficient reason.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Frank, struggling to master his feelings; and then he related all that had occurred at the bridge; how Tony had saved the lady and gentleman, and the horse; and how his crew had pulled the chaise ashore.  \"You did right, Frank; forgive my hasty words,\" said Captain Sedley, with deep feeling.  \"Good, my hearty!\" exclaimed Uncle Ben, clapping his hands.  A heavy load had been removed from the mind of the veteran, who had almost come to believe that Frank _could_ do no wrong.  \"Tony's a hero; and shiver my timbers, if he oughtn't to be president of the United States, when he's old enough,\" exclaimed Uncle Ben.  \"He is a brave fellow. You have done well, both of you. However strict our orders are, no person should be a machine. Orders should be obeyed with judgment,\" continued Captain Sedley.  \"That's a fact. I could tell a yarn about that,\" added Uncle Ben. \"When I was in the old Varsayles, bound round the Horn--\"  \"Another time we will hear your yarn, Ben,\" interposed Captain Sedley. \"We will go over and see Tony now, and congratulate him on the honors the Butterfly has won. Haul in the gib sheet, Ben.\"  \"Ready--pull!\" said Frank.  \"Who protested now, Master Charles Hardy?\" asked Little Paul, as he good-naturedly punched the forward youth in the ribs.  \"Circumstances alter cases,\" replied Charles, sagely, as he bent on his oar.  \"Fact! but they altered them when the deed was done, not now, when you have found out that it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15002"],["title","All Aboard; or, Life on the Lake (#7)"],["body","right.\"     CHAPTER VII.  COMMODORE FRANK SEDLEY.   For a few days all Rippleton rang with the praises of Tony and his companions. All the particulars of the affair at the bridge had been given in the Rippleton Mercury, and the editor was profuse in his commendations of the skill and courage of the Butterfly Boat Club; and he did not withhold from the Zephyr the credit which was justly due. Tony was a hero, and his fame extended for many miles around.  Mr. Walker and his lady, who had been rescued from the river, visited Captain Sedley and the Weston family the next day. I need not tell my young readers how earnest he was in the expression of his admiration and gratitude. He was a wealthy merchant, and resided in a neighboring town. Being as warm-hearted and generous as he was just and discriminating, it was quite natural that he should give his feelings expression in some substantial token of his gratitude.  Before he left Rippleton, a check for five hundred dollars was placed in the hands of George Weston, with directions to give four hundred of it to the Butterfly, and one hundred to the Zephyr. In the division of the Butterfly's share, Mr. Walker desired that one hundred dollars should be given to Tony, and twenty-five dollars apiece to the crew; consenting, however, to let the whole sum be common property if the club desired.  This liberality was certainly munificent, princely; but Mr. Walker's wealth was quite sufficient to enable him to gratify his generous impulses. Tony said he felt a little \"ticklish\" about taking it, at first; but George assured him that Mr. Walker would feel hurt if he did not, and he concluded to accept it.  \"But what shall we do with it, George?\" asked the young hero, who was not a little embarrassed by the possession of so much money.  \"That is for you to decide.\"  \"What _can_ we do with it?\"  \"It will buy heaps of candy,\" suggested George, with a smile.  \"Candy!\" said Tony, contemptuously.  \"You can make a fund of it if you like.\"  \"What for?\"  \"For any purpose you may wish. By and by, you may want money for something.\"  \"What shall we do with it?\"  \"Put it in the Savings Bank.\"  \"But the next thing is, shall we divide it? or let it remain as the property of the club? I suppose the fellows will all do just as I do.\"  \"Perhaps the money would do the parents of some of them a great deal of good.\"  \"I think very likely; we will let them vote upon it. Here comes Frank. I wonder what they are going to do with theirs.\"  \"How do you do, Tony? I have come over to talk with you about the race. Next Wednesday is the day, you know.\"  \"I had forgotten all about the race in the excitement of the bridge affair.\"  \"I don't wonder.\"  \"What are you going to do with your money, Frank?\" asked Tony. \"Your club met last evening, I believe.\"  \"We voted to buy some philosophical apparatus with it.\"  \"Good! Did Tim Bunker vote for that?\"  \"He didn't vote at all. He wanted the money divided; but the vote was unanimous for spending it as I said. By the way, Mr. Walker was liberal--wasn't he?\"  \"Princely. He ought to have given you more and us less, though.\"  \"No; he did perfectly right. We did not deserve even what we got.\"  \"Just like you! But come into the club room--Butterfly Hall--and we will fix things for the race.\"  Frank and Tony discussed the details of the race, and at the end of an hour everything was arranged to the satisfaction of both. There was no difference of opinion except as to the length of the race. Tony, thought that twice up and down the lake, making an eight-mile race, would be best; but Frank felt sure that it was too long, and that it would tire the boys too much. So it was finally agreed that they should pull only once up and down, making about four miles.  As the Butterfly club were to meet that evening, Frank departed earlier than he otherwise would have done, so as not to be considered an intruder.  Tony's club were in high spirits that evening. The praise bestowed upon them had created a strong feeling of self-reliance in their minds. Their discipline had passed through a severe ordeal, and it was pronounced perfectly satisfactory by all concerned. They had done hard work, and done it well. Their success was the result of their excellent discipline. It would have been in vain that they had as good a commander as Tony, if promptness and obedience had been wanting.  \"Now, boys,\" said Tony, when he had called the meeting to order, \"we have arranged all the details of the race, and if you like, I will tell you about it.\"  \"Tell us,\" said several.  The chairman proceeded to give them the substance of his conversation with the coxswain of the Zephyr; and the rules they had adopted were of course agreed to by all present.  The Butterfly boys, elated with the results of the bridge affair, were confident that they should win the race. Tony, however, was not so sanguine. He knew, better than they, how skilful Frank was; and, if the Zephyr had not labored under the disadvantage of having a new member, he would have been sure of being beaten.  \"There is another subject which comes up for consideration to-night--I mean the gift of Mr. Walker. He has left it so that it may be divided among us, or held and used as common property,\" continued Tony.  The boys looked at each other, as if to pry into the thoughts of their neighbors. There was a long silence, and it was in vain that Tony called for the opinions of the members; they did not seem to have any opinions on the subject.  \"We will do just as you say, Mr. Chairman,\" said Little Paul.  \"So we will,\" added Henry Brown.  \"I shall not say,\" replied Tony. \"It is a matter for you to decide. George says we can put it in the Savings Bank, if we don't divide it, and keep it till we find a use for it. Perhaps, though, some of your parents may want it. If they do, we had better give each his share.\"  \"Let us put it in the Savings Bank,\" said Dick Chester.  But Henry Brown looked at Little Paul, whose father was a very poor man, and had not been able to work for several months.  \"Perhaps we had better divide it,\" suggested he.  \"If you agree to divide it, each member shall have a thirteenth part of the whole four hundred dollars,\" added Tony.  \"That wouldn't be right,\" replied Little Paul. \"He gave a hundred to you; and certainly you are better entitled to a hundred than we are to a penny apiece.\"  \"I will not take more than my share.\"  \"We will only take what Mr. Walker awarded us,\" said Henry.  \"That we won't,\" added several members.  \"No!\" shouted the whole club.  \"But you _shall_, my lads,\" said Tony, stoutly. \"George and I have agreed to that.\"  \"But the commander of the ship ought to have a bigger share than the crew; besides, what could we have done without you?\" argued Little Paul.  \"And what could I have done without you?\"  \"It was your skill and courage, as the Mercury says, which did the business.\"  \"It was your prompt obedience that crowned our labors with success. I tell you, boys, it is just as broad as it is long. The money shall be equally divided.\"  \"Then we won't divide it,\" said Henry Brown.  \"Very well; I will agree to that. We shall be equal owners then,\" replied Tony, with a smile of triumph; for in either case his point was gained.  \"But what shall we do with it? Four hundred dollars is a heap of money. What's the use of saving it up without having some idea of what we mean to do with it?\"  \"We can put it to a dozen uses.\"  \"What, for instance?\"  \"Why, enlarging our library; buying an apparatus, as the Zephyrs are going to do; giving it to the poor,\" replied Tony. \"But I was thinking of something before the meeting.\"  The boys all looked at the chairman with inquiring glances.  \"Out with it,\" said several of them.  \"There are lots of fellows round here who would like to get into a boat club.\"  \"More than twenty,\" added Little Paul.  \"We have money enough to buy another boat.\"  \"Hurrah!\" exclaimed several of the members, jumping out of their chairs in the excitement of the moment. \"Let us buy another boat!\"  \"What shall we call her?\" added Dick Chestor.  Several of the boys began to exercise their minds on this important question, without devoting any more attention to the propriety or the practicability of procuring another boat. That question was regarded as already settled.  \"Ay, what shall we call her?\" repeated Joseph Hooper.  \"What do you say to the 'Lily?'\"  \"The 'Water Sprite?'\"  \"The 'Go-ahead?'\"  \"Name her after Mr. Walker.\"  \"No; after Tony Weston.\"  \"You are counting the chickens before they are hatched,\" added Tony, laughing heartily.  \"The--the--the 'Red Rover,'\" said Joseph Hooper.  \"That's too piratical,\" replied Little Paul.  \"I wouldn't say anything about the name at present,\" suggested Tony.  \"Wouldn't it be fine, though, to have three boats on the lake?\" exclaimed Henry.  \"Glorious! A race with three boats!\"  \"Who would be coxswain of the new boat?\"  \"Fred Harper,\" said little Paul. \"The fellows say he is almost as good as Frank Sedley.\"  \"If we had another boat we should want a commodore,\" continued Tony. \"And I was thinking, if we got another, that Frank would be the commodore, and command the fleet. Then there would be a coxswain to each boat besides.\"  \"That would be first rate.\"  \"Let us have the other boat.\"  \"Hurrah! so I say.\"  \"I suppose we could buy two six-oar boats for our money,\" added Tony.  \"And have four in the fleet?\"  \"Perhaps three four-oar boats.\"  \"Five boats in the fleet! That would be a glorious squadron!\"  The boys could hardly repress the delight which these air castles excited, and several of them kept jumping up and down, they were so nervous and so elated.  \"Come, Tony, let us settle the business, and order the boats at once,\" said Dick Chester.  \"We had better think a while of it. Something else may turn up which will suit us even better than the fleet. Of course we must consult Captain Sedley and George before we do anything,\" replied Tony.  \"They will be willing.\"  \"Perh"]]]
