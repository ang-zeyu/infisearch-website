Each one strained every nerve to break the bundle. After a long but vain trial, they all said that it could not be done.   116  ECLECTIC SERIES. 4. \"And yet, my boys,\" said the father, \"nothing is easier to do.\" He then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one by one, with perfect ease.  5. \"Ah!\" said his sons, \"it is easy enough to do it so; anybody could do it in that way.\" 6. Their father replied, \"As it is with these sticks, so is it with you, my sons. So   THIRD READER.  117 long as you hold fast together and aid each other, you will prosper, and none can injure you. 7. \"But if the bond of union be broken, it will happen to you just as it has to these sticks, which lie here broken on the ground.\"  Home, city, country, all are prosperous found, When by the powerful link of union bound.    LESSON XLV. THE MOUNTAIN SISTER. 1. The home of little Jeannette is far away, high up among the mountains. Let us call her our mountain sister. 2. There are many things you would like to hear about her, but I can only tell you now how she goes with her father and brother, in the autumn, to help gather nuts for the long winter.   118  ECLECTIC SERIES. 3. A little way down the mountain side is a chestnut wood. Did you ever see a chestnut tree? In the spring its branches are covered with bunches of  creamy flowers, like long tassels. All the hot summer these are turning into sweet nuts, wrapped safely in large, prickly, green balls. 4. But when the frost of autumn comes, these prickly balls turn brown, and crack open. Then you may see inside one, two, three, and even four, sweet, brown nuts. 5. When her father says, one night at supper time, \"I think there will be a frost tonight,\" Jeannette knows very well what to do. She dances away early in the evening to her little bed, made in a box built up against the wall. 6. Soon she falls asleep to dream about    THIRD READER.  119 the chestnut wood, and the little brook that springs from rock to rock down under the tall, dark trees. She wakes with the first daylight, and is out of bed in a minute, when she hears her father's cheerful call, \"Come, children; it is time to be off.\" 7. Their dinner is ready in a large basket. The donkey stands before the door with great bags for the nuts hanging at each side. They go merrily over the crisp, white frost to the chestnut trees. How the frost has opened the burs! It has done half their work for them already. 8. How they laugh and sing, and shout to each other as they fill their baskets! The sun looks down through the yellow leaves; the rocks give them mossy seats; the birds and squirrels wonder what these strange people are doing in their woods. 9. Jeannette really helps, though she is only a little girl; and her father says at night, that his Jane is a dear, good child. This makes her very happy. She thinks about it at night, when she says her prayers. Then she goes to sleep to dream of the merry autumn days. 10. Such is our little mountain sister, and   120  ECLECTIC SERIES.   here is a picture of her far-away home. The mountain life is ever a fresh and happy one.     THIRD READER.  121  LESSON XLVI.  HARRY AND THE GUIDEPOST.  1. The night was dark, the sun was hid Beneath the mountain gray, And not a single star appeared To shoot a silver ray.  2. Across the heath the owlet flew, And screamed along the blast; And onward, with a quickened step, Benighted Harry passed.  3. Now, in thickest darkness plunged, He groped his way to find; And now, he thought he saw beyond, A form of horrid kind.  4. In deadly white it upward rose, Of cloak and mantle bare, And held its naked arms across, To catch him by the hair.  5. Poor Harry felt his blood run cold, At what before him stood; But then, thought he, no harm, I'm sure, Can happen to the good.   122  ECLECTIC SERIES.  6. So, calling all his courage up, He to the monster went; And eager through the dismal gloom His piercing eyes he bent.  7. And when he came well nigh the ghost That gave him such affright, He clapped his hands upon his side, And loudly laughed outright.  8. For 't was a friendly guidepost stood, His wandering steps to guide; And thus he found that to the good, No evil could betide.     THIRD READER.  123  9.   Ah well, thought he, one thing I've learned, Nor shall I soon forget; Whatever frightens me again, I'll march straight up to it.  10. And when I hear an idle tale, Of monster or of ghost, I'll tell of this, my lonely walk, And one tall, white guidepost.     LESSON XLVII.  THE MONEY AMY DID N'T EARN.  1. Amy was a dear little girl, but she was too apt to waste time in getting ready to do her tasks, instead of doing them at once as she ought.   124  ECLECTIC SERIES. 2. In the village in which she lived, Mr. Thornton kept a store where he sold fruit of all kinds, including berries in their season. One day he said to Amy, whose parents were quite poor, \"Would you like to earn some money? \" 3. \"Oh, yes,\" replied she, \"for I want some new shoes, and papa has no money to buy them with.\" 4. \"Well, Amy,\" said Mr. Thorhton, \"I noticed some fine, ripe blackberries in Mr. Green's pasture to-day, and he said that anybody was welcome to them. I will pay you thirteen cents a quart for all you will pick for me.\" 5. Amy was delighted at the thought of earning some money; so she ran home to get a basket, intending to go immediately to pick the berries. 6. Then she thought she would like to know how much money she would get if she picked five quarts. With the help of her slate and pencil, she found out that she would get sixty-five cents. 7. \"But supposing I should pick a dozen quarts,\" thought she, \"how much should I earn then?\" \"Dear me,\" she said, after   THIRD READER.  125 figuring a while, \"I should earn a dollar and fifty-six cents.\" 8. Amy then found out what Mr. Thornton would pay her for fifty, a hundred, and two hundred quarts. It took her some time to  do this, and then it was so near dinner time that she had to stay at home until afternoon. 9. As soon as dinner was over, she took   126  ECLECTIC SERIES, her basket and hurried to the pasture. Some boys had been there before dinner, and all the ripe berries were picked. She could not find enough to fill a quart measure. 10. As Amy went home, she thought of what her teacher had often told her--\"Do your task at once; then think about it,\" for \"one doer is worth a hundred dreamers.\"    LESSON XLVIII. WHO MADE THE STARS?  1. \"Mother, who made the stars, which light The beautiful blue sky? Who made the moon, so clear and bright, That rises up so high?\"  2. \"'T was God, my child, the Glorious One, He formed them by his power; He made alike the brilliant sun, And every leaf and flower.   THIRD  READER.  127  3. \"He made your little feet to walk; Your sparkling eyes to see; Your busy, prattling tongue to talk, And limbs so light and free.  4. \"He paints each fragrant flower that blows, With loveliness and bloom; He gives the violet and the rose Their beauty and perfume.  5. \"Our various wants his hands supply; He guides us every hour; We're kept beneath his watchful eye, And guarded by his power.  6. \"Then let your little heart, my love, Its grateful homage pay To that kind Friend, who, from above, Thus guides you every day.  7. \"In all the changing scenes of time, On Him our hopes depend; In every age, in every clime, Our Father and our Friend.\"     128  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XLIX. DEEDS OF KINDNESS. 1. One day, as two little boys were walking along the road, they overtook a woman carrying a large basket of apples. 2. The boys thought the woman looked very pale and tired; so they said, \"Are you going to town? If you are, we will carry your basket.\" 3. \"Thank you,\" replied the woman, \"you are very kind: you see I am weak and ill.\" Then she told them that she was a widow, and had a lame son to support. 4. She lived in a cottage three miles away, and was now going to market to sell the apples which grew on the only tree in her little garden. She wanted the money to pay her rent. 5. \"We are going the same way you are,\" said the boys. \"Let us have the basket;\" and they took hold of it, one on each side, and trudged along with merry hearts. 6. The poor widow looked glad, and said that she hoped their mother would not be angry with them. \"Oh, no,\" they replied;   THIRD READER.  129 \"our mother has taught us to be kind to everybody, and to be useful in any way that we can.\" 7. She then offered to give them a few of  the ripest apples for their trouble. \"No,  thank you,\" said they; \"we do not want any pay for what we have done.\" 8. When the widow got home, she told her lame son what had happened on the road, 3. 9.   130  ECLECTIC SERIES. and they were both made happier that day by the kindness of the two boys. 9. The other day, I saw a little girl stop and pick up a piece of orange peel, which she threw into the gutter. \"I wish the boys would not throw orange peel on the sidewalk,\" said she. \"Some one may tread upon it, and fall.\" 10. \"That is right, my dear,\" I said. \"It is a little thing for you to do what you have done, but it shows that you have a thoughtful mind and a feeling heart.\" 11. Perhaps some may say that these are little things. So they are; but we must not wait for occasions to do great things. We must begin with little labors of love.   LESSON L. THE ALARM CLOCK. 1. A lady, who found it not easy to wake in the morning as early as she wished,   THIRD READER.  131 bought an alarm clock. These clocks are so made as to strike with a loud whirring noise at any hour the owner pleases to set them. 2. The lady placed her clock at the head of the bed, and at the right time she found herself roused by the long, rattling sound. 3. She arose at once, and felt better all day for her early rising. This lasted for some weeks. The alarm clock faithfully did its duty, and was plainly heard so long as it was obeyed. 4. But, after a time, the lady grew tired of early rising.

And not so far from London town, beyond the brimming street,   A thousand little summer winds are singing in the wheat.      Red-lipped poppies stand and burn,       The hedges are aglow;     The daisies climb the windy hills       Till all grow white like snow.   And when the slim, pale moon slides up, and dreamy night is near,   There's a whisper in the beeches for lonely hearts to hear.      Poppies burn in Italy,       And suns grow round and high;     The black pines of Posilipo       Are gaunt upon the sky--   And yet I know an English elm beside an English lane   That calls me through the twilight and the miles of misty rain.      Tell me why the meadow-lands       Become so warm in June;     Why the tangled roses breathe       So softly to the moon;   And when the sunset bars come down to pass the feet of day,   Why the singing thrushes slide between the sprigs of May?      Weary, we have wandered back--       And we have travelled far--     Above the storms and over seas       Gleamed ever one bright star--   O England! when our feet grow cold and will no longer roam,   We see beyond your milk-white cliffs the round,            green fields of home.     The Madness of Winds    On all the upland pastures the strong winds gallop free,     Trampling down the flowered stalks sleepy in the sun,   Whirl away in blue and gold all their finery,     Till naked crouch the gentle hosts where the winds have run.    Along the rocking hillsides shaggy heads are bent;     Out upon the tawny plains tortured dust leaps high;   The red roof of the sunset is torn away and rent,     And chaos lifts the heavy sea and bends the hollow sky.    The winds are drunk with freedom--the crowded valleys roar;     The madness surges through their veins, and when they gallop out   The black rain follows close behind, the pale sun flees before,     And recklessly across the world goes all the broken rout.    I was striding on the uplands when the host was running mad,     I saw them threshing through the leaves and daisy tops below,   And as their feet came up the hill, my tired heart grew glad--     Till at the music of their throats I knew that I must go.    So the winds are now my brothers, they have joined me to their ranks,     And when their rampant strength wells up and drives them singing forth,   I am with them when they roll the fog across the oily banks,     And tumble out the sleeping bergs that crowd beyond the north.    The woods are drenched with moonlight and every leafs awake;     The little beads of dew sit white on every twig and blade;   A thousand stars are scattered thick beneath the forest lake;     We pass--with only laughter for the havoc we have made.    There's not a wind that brushes the long bright fields of corn,     Or, shrieking, drives the broken wreck beneath a blackened sea,   There's not a wind that draws the rain across the face of morn     That does not rise when I arise and sink again with me.     Young Blood    They took me from the forests and they put me in the town;   They bid me learn the wisdom the wise men have laid down,     To put by my childish ways     And forget my Golden Days,   With my feet upon the ladder that runs up to high renown.    So I would not hear the voices that were calling day and night,   And I would not see the visions that were ever in my sight;     But I mingled with the throngs,     Heard their curses and their songs,   And raised the brimming glass on high to catch the yellow light.    But I was not meant to wander where the wild things never came,   Where the night-time was like day-time and the seasons were the same;     Where the city's sullen roar     Ever surged against my door,   And the only peace was battle and the only goal was fame.    For my blood pulsed hot within me and the prize seemed wondrous small;   And my soul cried out for freedom in a world beyond a wall.     Oh, fame can well be sung     By those no longer young,   By wisdom, age and learning; but youth transcends them all!    So I'll let the spring of life well up and drown the empty quest;   And I'll watch the stars more bright than fame gleam red along the crest;     And taste the driving rain     Between my lips again,   And know that to the blood of youth the open road is best.    With Spring-time in the woodlands will my pulses stir and thrill;   I'll run below the wet young moon where myriad frogs pipe shrill;     I'll forget the world of strife,     Where fame is more than life;   And I'll mate with youth and beauty when the sun is on the hill.     The Homesteader    Mother England, I am coming, cease your calling for a season,     For the plains of wheat need reaping, and the thrasher's at the door.   All these long years I have loved you, but you cannot call it treason     If I loved my shack of shingles and my little baby more.    Now my family have departed--for the good Lord took them early--     And I turn to thee, O England, as a son that seeks his home.   Now younger folk may plough and plant the plains I love so dearly,     Whose acres stretch too wide for feet that can no longer roam.    If the western skies are bluer and the western snows are whiter,     And the flowers of the prairie-lands are bright and honey-sweet,   'Tis the scent of English primrose makes my weary heart beat lighter     As I count the days that part me from your little cobble street.    For the last time come the reapers (you can hear the knives ring cheery     As they pitch the bearded barley in a thousand tents of gold);   For I see the cliffs of Devon bulking dark beyond the prairie,     And hear the skylarks calling to a heart that's growing old.    When the chaff-piles cease their burning and the frost is closing over     All the barren leagues of stubble that my lonely feet have passed,   I shall spike the door and journey towards the Channel lights of Dover--     That England may receive my dreams and bury them at last!     Husbands Over Seas    Each morning they sit down to their little bites of bread,     To six warm bowls of porridge and a broken mug or two.   And each simple soul is happy and each hungry mouth is fed--     Then why should she be smiling as the weary-hearted do?    All day the house has echoed to their tiny, treble laughter     (Six little rose-faced cherubs who trip shouting through the day),   Till the candle lights the cradle and runs dark along the rafter--     Then why should she be watching while the long night wastes away?    She tells them how their daddy has sailed out across the seas,     And they'll be going after when the May begins to bloom.   Oh, they clap their hands together as they cluster round her knees--     Then why should she be weeping as they tumble from the room?    The May has bloomed and withered and the haws are clinging red,     The winter winds are talking in the dead ranks of the trees;   And still she tells of daddy as she tucks each tot in bed--     God pity all dear women who have husbands over seas!     The Country Goes to Town    The Country walked to Town, and what did she find there?   Not a bird nor flower, the trees forsaken were;   The folk were walking two-and-two in every lane and street--   You scarce could hear your neighbour for the racket of their feet.    She could not see the sun shine for dust about the sky;   She could not hear the winds call, the walls went up so high;   And even when the night came to brush aside the day,   She found about the city they were driving it away.    \"Then what have you got here?\" the Country asked the Town.   \"There's not a green leaf anywhere, the world is bleak and brown,   I haven't seen a red cheek nor heard a woman's laughter;   I'm going back to Bird Land, but won't you follow after?\"    The Town rode to the Country, and what did she find there?   Just a lot of emptiness, with flowers everywhere.   The birds were screaming overhead, the sun was on her face,   The fences were untidy, and the brambles a disgrace.    \"Then what have you got here?\" the Town cried in her scorn.   \"I haven't met a four-in-hand nor heard a motor horn.   It'll cost a pretty penny to restore my riding clothes,   While my beauty is nigh ruined for the freckles on my nose.\"    \"What have I got here?  Just azure hills and peace,   Green moss and green fern on roads that never cease.   And if my heart grows weary of such pleasurings as these,   There's a baby who comes romping through the nursery of the trees!\"     The Trail from Napoli    From Capo di Sorrento, its poppies and its clover,     The headlands of Fosilipo, the wharves of Napoli,   A wide blue trail runs westward to the ocean rim and over     To where there lies a little town with lights along the sea.    Here pink and blue the villas crowd beside the yellow sand,     And sweet and hot, the scented winds puff sultry to the bay,   The shadow of Vesuvius lies gray across the land--     And on my heart a loneliness that calls me far away.
