They dug down to the bottom of his hole and then, because they didn't find him there, they straightway fell to quarreling, each blaming the other for suggesting such a lot of hard work for nothing. Finally they went away, still calling each other names, and from that day to this, Foxes and Badgers have never been friends.  \"Mr. Mole was very thankful for his narrow escape, and it set him to thinking. If he had a lot of these underground tunnels, no one would be able to catch him. It was a splendid idea! He went to work on it at once. And then he made a discovery--such a splendid discovery! There was plenty of food to eat right down under ground--worms and grubs--all he needed. After that, Mr. Mole spent all his time in his tunnels and seldom put his nose outside. He was safe, and he was comfortable, and he could always find something to eat by digging for it.  \"Little by little his old neighbors forgot all about him. Because he had little use for them, his eyes grew smaller and smaller, and when he did come up into the light, they hurt him so that he was glad to go back into the dark again. He was perfectly happy and satisfied there, and what is there in life better than to be happy and satisfied?\"  \"Nothing,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, at whom Grandfather Frog happened to be looking when he asked the question.  \"Right!\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"And now you know why Miner the Mole lives under ground--because he is perfectly happy and satisfied there.\"  Just then up came Peter Rabbit, all out of breath.  \"Has Grandfather Frog been telling a story?\" he panted.  \"Yes,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, winking at Grandfather Frog, \"and now we are going back home perfectly happy and satisfied.\"  And to this day Peter Rabbit wonders what the story was that he missed.     X  WHY MR. SNAKE CANNOT WINK   Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were playing tag on the Green Meadows. Of course Peter can run so much faster than Johnny Chuck that he would never have been \"it\" if he had tried his best to keep out of the way. But he didn't. No, Sir, Peter Rabbit didn't do anything of the kind. He pretended that one of his long hind-legs was lame so that he had to run on three legs, while Johnny Chuck could use all four. It was great fun. They raced and dodged and twisted and turned. Sometimes Peter was so excited that he would forget and use all four legs. Then Johnny Chuck would shout \"No fair!\" Peter would say that he didn't mean to, and to make up for it would be \"it\" and try to catch Johnny.  Now it happened that curled up on a little grassy tussock, taking an early morning sun-bath, lay little Mr. Greensnake. Of course Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were not afraid of him. If it had been Mr. Rattlesnake or Mr. Gophersnake, it would have been different. But from little Mr. Greensnake there was nothing to fear, and sometimes, just for fun, Peter would jump right over him. When he did that, Peter always winked good-naturedly. But Mr. Greensnake never winked back. Instead he would raise his head, run his tongue out at Peter, and hiss in what he tried to make a very fierce and angry manner. Then Peter would laugh and wink at him again. But never once did Mr. Greensnake wink back.  [Illustration: He would make no reply, save to run out his tongue at them.]  Peter was thinking of this as he and Johnny Chuck stretched out in a sunny spot to get their breath and rest. He had never thought of it before, but now that he had noticed it, he couldn't remember that he ever had seen little Mr. Greensnake wink, nor any of Mr. Greensnake's relatives. He mentioned the matter to Johnny Chuck.  \"That's so,\" replied Johnny thoughtfully. \"I never have seen any of them wink, either. Do you suppose they can wink?\"  \"Let's go ask Mr. Greensnake,\" said Peter.  Up they hopped and raced over to the grassy tussock where Mr. Greensnake lay, but to all their questions he would make no reply save to run out his tongue at them. Finally they gave up asking him.  \"I tell you what, let's go over to the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog. He'll be sure to know, and perhaps, if he is feeling good, he'll tell us a story,\" said Peter.  So off they scampered to the Smiling Pool. There they found Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily-pad just as usual, and Peter knew by the look in his great, goggly eyes that Grandfather Frog had a good breakfast of foolish green flies tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat. His eyes twinkled as Peter and Johnny very politely wished him good morning.  \"Good morning,\" said he gruffly.  But Peter had seen that twinkle in his eyes and knew that Grandfather Frog was feeling good-natured in spite of his gruff greeting.  \"If you please, Grandfather Frog, why doesn't Mr. Greensnake wink at us when we wink at him?\" he asked.  \"Chug-a-rum! Because he can't,\" replied Grandfather Frog.  \"Can't!\" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck together.  \"That's what I said--can't,\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"And no more can Mr. Blacksnake, or Mr. Rattlesnake, or Mr. Gophersnake, or any other member of the Snake family.\"  \"Why not?\" cried Peter and Johnny, all in the same breath.  \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog, folding his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat, \"if you will sit still until I finish, I'll tell you; but if you move or ask any foolish questions, I'll stop right where I am, and you'll never hear the end of the story, for no one else knows it.\"  Of course Peter and Johnny promised to sit perfectly still and not say a word. After they had made themselves comfortable, Grandfather Frog cleared his throat as if to begin, but for a long time he didn't say a word. Once Peter opened his mouth to ask why, but remembered in time and closed it again without making a sound.  At last Grandfather Frog cleared his throat once more, and with a far-away look in his great, goggly eyes began:  \"Once upon a time, long, long ago, when the world was young, lived old Mr. Snake, the grandfather a thousand times removed of little Mr. Greensnake and all the other Snakes whom you know. Of course he wasn't old then. He was young and spry and smart, was Mr. Snake. Now there is such a thing as being too smart. That was the trouble with Mr. Snake. Yes, Sir, that was the trouble with Mr. Snake. He was so smart that he soon found out that he was the smartest of all the meadow and forest people, and that was a bad thing. It certainly was a very bad thing.\" Grandfather Frog shook his head gravely.  \"You see,\" he continued, \"as soon as he found that out, he began to take advantage of his neighbors and cheat them, but he would do it so smoothly that they never once suspected that they were being cheated. Mr. Snake would go about all day cheating everybody he met. At night he would go home and chuckle over his smartness. It wasn't long before he began to look down on his neighbors for being so honest that they didn't suspect other people of being dishonest, and for being so easily cheated.  \"Now one bad habit almost always leads to another. From cheating, Mr. Snake just naturally slipped to stealing. Yes, Sir, he became a thief. Of course that made trouble right away, but still no one suspected Mr. Snake. He was always very polite to every one and always offering to do favors for his neighbors. In fact, Mr. Snake was very well liked and much respected. When any one had been robbed, he was always the first to offer sympathy and join in the hunt for the thief. He was so spry and slim, and could slip through the tall grass so fast, that he could go almost where he pleased without being seen, and this made him very bold. If he did happen to be found near the scene of trouble, he always had a story ready to account for his presence, and it sounded so true, and he told it in such an honest manner, that no one thought of doubting it.  \"So Mr. Snake found that lying helped him to cheat and steal, and all the time he kept thinking how smart he was. But even Mr. Snake had a little bit of conscience, and once in a while it would trouble him. So what do you think he did? Why, cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually tried to cheat himself--to cheat his conscience! When he was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if these folks are not smart enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their own fault if they believe what I am telling them.' But always he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one he was talking to.  \"Dear me, dear me, such terrible times as there were on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest! They grew worse and worse, and when at last Old Mother Nature came to see how all the little people were getting along, she heard so many complaints that she hardly knew where to begin to straighten matters out. She had all the little people come before her in turn and tell their troubles. When it came Mr. Snake's turn, he had no complaint to make. He seemed to be the only one who had no troubles. She asked him a great many questions, and for each one he had a ready reply. Of course a great many of these replies were lies, and every time he told one of these, he winked without knowing it. You see, it had become a habit.  \"Now, with all his smartness, Mr. Snake had forgotten one thing, one very important thing. It was this: You can't fool Old Mother Nature, and it is of no use to try. He hadn't been talking three minutes before she knew who was at the bottom of all the trouble. She let him finish, then called all the others about her and told them who had made all the trouble. Mr. Snake was very bold. He held his head very high in the air and pretended not to care. When Old Mother Nature turned her head, he even ran out his tongue at her, just as all the Snake family do at you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],["title","The Hymns of Prudentius (#0)"],["body","Team.

Instat terminus et diem   vicinum senio iam Deus adplicat.                            5   Quid nos utile tanti spatio temporis egimus?     Aetas prima crepantibus   flevit sub ferulis: mox docuit toga   infectum vitiis falsa loqui, non sine crimine.     Tum lasciva protervitas,                                 10   et luxus petulans (heu pudet ac piget)   foedavit iuvenem nequitiae sordibus ac luto.     Exin iurgia turbidos   armarunt animos et male pertinax   vincendi studium subiacuit casibus asperis.                15     Bis legum moderamine   frenos nobilium reximus urbium,   ius civile bonis reddidimus, terruimus reos.     Tandem militiae gradu   evectum pietas principis extulit                           20   adsumptum propius stare iubens ordine proximo.     Haec dum vita volans agit,   inrepsit subito canities seni   oblitum veteris me Saliae consulis arguens:     ex quo prima dies mihi                                   25   quam multas hiemes volverit et rosas   pratis post glaciem reddiderit, nix capitis probat.     Numquid talia proderunt   carnis post obitum vel bona vel mala,   cum iam, quidquid id est, quod fueram, mors aboleverit?    30     Dicendum mihi; Quisquis es,   mundum, quem coluit, mens tua perdidit:   non sunt illa Dei, quae studuit, cuius habeberis.     Atqui fine sub ultimo   peccatrix anima stultitiam exuat:                          35   saltem voce Deum concelebret, si meritis nequit:     hymnis continuet dies,   nec nox ulla vacet, quin Dominum canat:   pugnet contra hereses, catholicam discutiat fidem,     conculcet sacra gentium,                                 40   labem, Roma, tuis inferat idolis,   carmen martyribus devoveat, laudet apostolos.

Yet now the end draws nigh, and by God's will   Old age's bound is reached: how have I spent   And with what fruit so wide a tract of days?   I wept in boyhood 'neath the sounding rod:   Youth's toga donned, the rhetorician's arts   I plied and with deceitful pleadings sinned:   Anon a wanton life and dalliance gross   (Alas! the recollection stings to shame!)   Fouled and polluted manhood's opening bloom:   And then the forum's strife my restless wits   Enthralled, and the keen lust of victory   Drove me to many a bitterness and fall.   Twice held I in fair cities of renown   The reins of office, and administered   To good men justice and to guilty doom.   At length the Emperor's will beneficent   Exalted me to military power   And to the rank that borders on the throne.   The years are speeding onward, and gray hairs   Of old have mantled o'er my brows   And Salia's consulship from memory dies.   What frost-bound winters since that natal year   Have fled, what vernal suns reclothed   The meads with roses,--this white crown declares.   Yet what avail the prizes or the blows   Of fortune, when the body's spark is quenched   And death annuls whatever state I held?   This sentence I must hear: \"Whate'er thou art,   Thy mind hath lost the world it loved: not God's   The things thou soughtest, Whose thou now shalt be.\"   Yet now, ere hence I pass, my sinning soul   Shall doff its folly and shall praise my Lord   If not by deeds, at least with humble lips.   Let each day link itself with grateful hymns   And every night re-echo songs of God:   Yea, be it mine to fight all heresies,   Unfold the meanings of the Catholic faith,   Trample on Gentile rites, thy gods, O Rome,   Dethrone, the Martyrs laud, th' Apostles sing.   O while such themes my pen and tongue employ,   May death strike off these fetters of the flesh   And bear me whither my last breath shall rise!                            I. HYMNUS AD GALLI CANTUM       Ales diei nuntius   lucem propinquam praecinit;   nos excitator mentium   iam Christus ad vitam vocat.      Auferte, clamat, lectulos          5   aegros, soporos, desides:   castique recti ac sobrii   vigilate, iam sum proximus.      Post solis ortum fulgidi   serum est cubile spernere,          10   ni parte noctis addita   tempus labori adieceris.      Vox ista, qua strepunt aves   stantes sub ipso culmine   paulo ante quam lux emicet,         15   nostri figura est iudicis.      Tectos tenebris horridis   stratisque opertos segnibus   suadet quietem linquere   iam iamque venturo die.             20      Ut, cum coruscis flatibus   aurora caelum sparserit,   omnes labore exercitos   confirmet ad spem luminis.      Hic somnus ad tempus datus        25   est forma mortis perpetis,   peccata ceu nox horrida   cogunt iacere ac stertere.      Sed vox ab alto culmine   Christi docentis praemonet,         30   adesse iam lucem prope,   ne mens sopori serviat:      Ne somnus usque ad terminos   vitae socordis opprimat   pectus sepultum crimine             35   et lucis oblitum suae.      Ferunt vagantes daemonas   laetos tenebris noctium,   gallo canente exterritos   sparsim timere et cedere.           40      Invisa nam vicinitas   lucis, salutis, numinis   rupto tenebrarum situ   noctis fugat satellites.      Hoc esse signum praescii          45   norunt repromissae spei,   qua nos soporis liberi   speramus adventum Dei.      Quae vis sit huius alitis,   salvator ostendit Petro,            50   ter antequam gallus canat   sese negandum praedicans.      Fit namque peccatum prius,   quam praeco lucis proximae   inlustret humanum genus             55   finemque peccandi ferat.      Flevit negator denique   ex ore prolapsum nefas,   cum mens maneret innocens,   animusque servaret fidem.           60      Nec tale quidquam postea   linguae locutus lubrico est,   cantuque galli cognito   peccare iustus destitit.      Inde est quod omnes credimus,     65   illo quietis tempore   quo gallus exsultans canit   Christum redisse ex inferis.      Tunc mortis oppressus vigor,   tunc lex subacta est tartari,       70   tunc vis diei fortior   noctem coegit cedere.      Iam iam quiescant inproba,   iam culpa furva obdormiat,   iam noxa letalis suum               75   perpessa somnum marceat.      Vigil vicissim spiritus   quodcumque restat temporis,   dum meta noctis clauditur,   stans ac laborans excubet.          80      Iesum ciamus vocibus   flentes, precantes, sobrii:   intenta supplicatio   dormire cor mundum vetat.      Sat convolutis artubus            85   sensum profunda oblivio   pressit, gravavit, obruit   vanis vagantem somniis.      Sunt nempe falsa et frivola,   quae mundiali gloria                90   ceu dormientes egimus:   vigilemus, hic est veritas.      Aurum, voluptas, gaudium,   opes, honores, prospera,   quaecumque nos inflant mala,        95   fit mane, nil sunt omnia.      Tu, Christe, somnum dissice,   tu rumpe noctis vincula,   tu solve peccatum vetus   novumque lumen ingere.             100                              I. HYMN AT COCK-CROW     Awake! the shining day is born!   The herald cock proclaims the morn:   And Christ, the soul's Awakener, cries,   Bidding us back to life arise.    Away the sluggard's bed! away   The slumber of the soul's decay!   Ye chaste and just and temperate,   Watch! I am standing at the gate.    After the sun hath risen red   'Tis late for men to scorn their bed,   Unless a portion of the night   They seize for labours of the light.    Mark ye, what time the dawn draws nigh,   How 'neath the eaves the swallows cry?   Know that by true similitude   Their notes our Judge's voice prelude.    When hid by shades of dark malign   On beds of softness we recline,   They call us forth with music clear   Warning us that the day is near.    When breezes bright of orient morn   With rosy hues the heavens adorn,   They cheer with hope of gladdening light   The hearts that spend in toil their might.    Though sleep be but a passing guest   'Tis type of death's perpetual rest:   Our sins are as a ghastly night,   And seal with slumbers deep our sight.    But from the wide roof of the sky   Christ's voice peals forth with urgent cry,   Calling our sleep-bound hearts to rise   And greet the dawn with wakeful eyes.    He bids us fear lest sensual ease   Unto life's end the spirit seize   And in the tomb of shame us bind,   Till we are to the true light blind.    'Tis said that baleful spirits roam   Abroad beneath the dark's vast dome;   But, when the cock crows, take their flight   Sudden dispersed in sore affright.    For the foul votaries of the night   Abhor the coming of the light,   And shamed before salvation's grace   The hosts of darkness hide their face.    They know the cock doth prophesy   Of Hope's long-promised morning sky,   When comes the Majesty Divine   Upon awakened worlds to shine.    The Lord to Peter once foretold   What meaning that shrill strain should hold,   How he before cock-crow would lie   And thrice his Master dear deny.    For 'tis a law that sin is done   Before the herald of the sun   To humankind the dawn proclaims   And with his cry the sinner shames.    Then wept he bitter tears aghast   That from his lips the words had passed,   Though guileless he his soul possessed   And faith still"]]]
