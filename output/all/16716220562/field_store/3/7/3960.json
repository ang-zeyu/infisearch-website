EMPHATIC PHRASE.  Sometimes several words in succession are emphasized, forming what is called an emphatic phrase.  EXAMPLES.  Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine nations but of the Alps themselves--shall I compare myself with this HALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?  Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the LAST TEN YEARS.    And if thou said'st I am not peer   To any lord in Scotland here,   Lowland or Highland, far or near,   Lord Angus-THOU-HAST-LIED!  EMPHATIC PAUSE.  The emphatic expression of a sentence often requires a pause where the grammatical construction authorizes none. This is sometimes called the rhetorical pause. Such pauses occur chiefly before or after an emphatic word or phrase, and sometimes both before and after it.  EXAMPLES.  Rise--fellow-men! our country--yet remains! By that dread name we wave the sword on high, And swear for her--to live--with her--to die.  But most--by numbers judge the poet's song: And smooth or rough, with them is--right or wrong.  He said; then full before their sight Produced the beast, and lo!--'t was white.    VI. MODULATION.  Modulation includes the variations of the voice. These may be classed under the heads of Pitch, Compass, Quantity, and Quality.  PITCH AND COMPASS.  If anyone will notice closely a sentence as uttered in private conversation, he will observe that very few successive words are pronounced in exactly the same key or with the same force. At the same time, however, there is a certain PITCH or key, which seems, on the whole, to prevail.  This keynote, or governing note, as it may be called, is that upon which the voice most frequently dwells, to which it usually returns when wearied, and upon which a sentence generally commences, and very frequently ends, while, at the same time, there is a considerable play of the voice above and below it.  This key may be high or low. It varies in different individuals, and at different times in the same individual, being governed by the nature of the subject and the emotions of the speaker. It is worthy of notice, however, that most speakers pitch their voices on a key too high.  The range of the voice above and below this note is called its COMPASS. When the speaker is animated, this range is great; but upon abstract subjects, or with a dull speaker, it is small. If, in reading or speaking, too high a note be chosen, the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low a pitch be selected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and in either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone than if one be taken between the two extremes.  To secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass observe the following rule:  RULE XII.--The reader or speaker should choose that pitch in which he can feel himself most at ease, and above and below which he may have most room for variation.  REMARK 1.--Having chosen the proper keynote, he should beware of confining himself to it. This constitutes monotony, one of the greatest faults in elocution. One very important instrument for giving expression and life to thought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes wearied and disgusted.  REMARK 2.--There is another fault of nearly equal magnitude, and of very frequent occurrence. This consists in varying the pitch and force without reference to the sense. A sentence is commenced with vehemence and in a high key, and the voice gradually sinks until, the breath being spent, it dies away in a whisper.  NOTE--The power of changing the key at will is difficult to acquire, but of great importance.  REMARK 3.--The habit of singsong, so common in reading poetry, as it is a variation of pitch without reference to the sense, is a species of the fault above mentioned.  REMARK 4.--If the reader or speaker is guided by the sense, and if he gives that emphasis, inflection, and expression required by the meaning, these faults speedily disappear.  REMARK 5.--To improve the voice in these respects, practice is necessary. Commence, for example, with the lowest pitch the voice can comfortably sound, and repeat whole paragraphs and pages upon that key with gentle force. Then repeat the paragraph with increased force, taking care not to raise the pitch. Then rise one note higher, and practice on that, then another, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice is reached. Reverse the process, and repeat as before until the lowest pitch is obtained.  NOTE.--In these and all similar exercises, be very careful not to confound pitch and force.    QUANTITY AND QUALITY.  The tones of the voice should vary also in quantity, or time required to utter a sound or a syllable, and in quality, or expression, according to the nature of the subject.  REMARK.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of persuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh, irregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the plaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow of words in argumentative style.  The following direction, therefore, is worthy of attention:  The tones of the voice should always correspond both in quantity and quality with the nature of the subject.  EXAMPLES.  Passion and Grief     \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief.    \"Across this stormy water,    And I'll forgive your Highland chief,       My daughter! O, my daughter!\"   Plaintive   I have lived long enough: my way of life   Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:   And that which should accompany old age,   As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,   I must not look to have.   Calm    A very great portion of this globe is covered  with water, which is    called sea, and is very distinct from rivers and lakes.   Fierce Anger    Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,   And shook his very frame for ire,         And--\"This to me?\" he said;      \"And 't were not for thy hoary beard,   Such hand as Marmion's had not spared      To cleave the Douglas' head!   Loud and Explosive       \"Even in thy pitch of pride,   Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,       I tell thee thou 'rt defied!   And if thou said'st I am not peer   To any lord in Scotland here,   Lowland or Highland, far or near,   Lord Angus, thou hast lied '\"   REMARK 1.--In our attempt to imitate nature it is important to avoid affectation, for to this fault even perfect monotony is preferable.  REMARK 2.--The strength of the voice may be increased by practicing with different degrees of loudness, from a whisper to full rotundity, taking care to keep the voice on the same key. The same note in music may be sounded loud or soft. So also a sentence may be pronounced on the same pitch with different degrees of loudness. Having practiced with different degrees of loudness on one key, make the same experiment on another, and then on another, and so on. This will also give the learner practice in compass,    VII. POETIC PAUSES.  In poetry we have, in addition to other pauses, poetic pauses. The object of these is simply to promote the melody.  At the end of each line a slight pause is proper, whatever be the grammatical construction or the sense. The purpose of this pause is to make prominent the melody of the measure, and in rhyme to allow the ear to appreciate the harmony of the similar sounds.  There is, also, another important pause, somewhere near the middle of each line, which is called the caesura or caesural pause. In the following lines it is marked thus (||):  EXAMPLES.    There are hours long departed || which memory brings,     Like blossoms of Eden || to twine round the heart,   And as time rushes by || on the might of his wings,     They may darken awhile || but they never depart.  REMARK.--The caesural pause should never be so placed as to injure the sense. The following lines, if melody alone were consulted, would be read thus:    With fruitless la || bor Clara bound,   And strove to stanch || the gushing wound;   The Monk with un || availing cares,   Exhausted all || the church's prayers.  This manner of reading, however, would very much interfere with the proper expression of the idea. This is to be corrected by making the caesural pause yield to the sense. The above lines should be read thus:    With fruitless labor || Clara bound,   And strove || to stanch the gushing wound;   The Monk || with unavailing cares,   Exhausted || all the church's prayers,    EXERCISES.  I. DEATH OF FRANKLIN. (To be read in a solemn tone.)  Franklin is dead. The genius who freed America', and poured a copious stream of knowledge throughout Europe', is returned unto the bosom of the Divinity'. The sage to whom two worlds' lay claim, the man for whom science' and politics' are disputing, indisputably enjoyed au elevated rank in human nature.  The cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of notifying the death of those who were great', only in their funeral orations'. Long hath the etiquette of courts', proclaimed the mourning of hypocrisy'. Nations' should wear mourning for none but their benefactors'. The representatives' of nations should recommend to public homage' only those who have been the heroes of humanity'.   II. BONAPARTE.  He knew no motive' but interst'; acknowledged no criterion' but success'; he worshiped no God' but ambition'; and with an eastern devotion', he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry'. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed' that he did not profess'; there was no opinion' that he did not promulgate': in the hope of a dynasty', he upheld the crescent'; for the sake of a divorce', he bowed before the cross'; the orphan of St. Louis', he became the adopted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15040"],["title","McGuffey's Fifth Eclectic Reader (#5)"],["body","of the republic'; and, with a parricidal ingrati-tude', on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism'.  At his touch crowns' crumbled'; beggars' reigned'; systems' van-ished'; the wildest theories' took the color of his whim'; and all that was venerable' and all that was novel', changed places with the rapidity of a drama'. Nature had no obstacle' that he did not surmount'; space, no opposition' he did not spurn'; and whether amid Alpine rocks',--Arabian sands',--or Polar snows',---he seemed proof' against peril', and empowered with ubiquity'.    III. HAMLET ON SEEING THE SKULL OF YORICK.  Alas, poor Yorick'! I knew him', Horatio'; a fellow of infinite jest', of most excellent fancy'. He hath borne me on his back' a thousand times'; and now', how abhorred my imagination is'! My gorge rises' at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed', I know not how oft', Where be your gibes' now? your gambols'? your songs'? your flashes of merriment', that were wont to set the table on a roar'? Not one', now, to mock your own grinning'? quite chopfallen'? Now get you to my lady's chamber' and tell her', let her paint an inch thick' to this favor' she must come'; make her laugh at that'.    IV. DESCRIPTION OF A BATTLE.  Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew' With wavering flight', while fiercer grew   Around, the battle yell. The border slogan rent the sky', A Home'! a Gordon'! was the cry';   Loud' were the clanging blows'; Advanced',--forced back',--now low',--now high',   The pennon sunk'--and rose'; As bends the bark's mast in the gale', When rent are rigging', shrouds', and sail',   It wavered 'mid the foes'. The war, that for a space did fail', Now trebly thundering swelled the gale',   And Stanley'! was the cry; A light on Marmion's visage spread',   And fired his glazing eye':-- With dying' hand', above his head', He shook the fragment of his blade',   And shouted',--\"Victory'! Charge', Chester', charge'! On' Stanley', on'!\"--   Were the last words of Marmion.    V. LORD ULLIN'S DAUGHTER.  For the inflections and emphasis in this selection, let the pupil be guided by his own judgment.  A chieftain to the Highlands bound,   Cries, \"Boatman, do not tarry! And I'll give thee a silver pound,   To row us o'er the ferry.\"  \"Now, who be ye would cross Loch-Gyle   This dark and stormy water?\" \"Oh! I'm the chief of Ulva's isle,   And this, Lord Ullin's daughter.  \"And fast before her father's men   Three days we've fled together, For should he find us in the glen,   My blood would stain the heather.  \"His horsemen hard behind us ride;   Should they our steps discover, Then who will cheer my bonny bride,   When they have slain her lover?\"  Out spoke the hardy Highland wight   \"I'll go, my chief--I'm ready: It is not for your silver bright,   But for your winsome lady:  \"And, by my word! the bonny bird   In danger shall not tarry; So, though the waves are raging white,   I'll row you o'er the ferry.\"  By this, the storm grew loud apace,   The water wraith was shrieking; And, in the scowl of heaven, each face   Grew dark as they were speaking.  But still, as wilder grew the wind,   And as the night grew drearer, Adown the glen rode armed men,   Their trampling sounded nearer.  \"Oh I haste thee, haste!\" the lady cries   \"Though tempest round us gather, I'll meet the raging of the skies,   But not an angry father.\"  The boat has left the stormy land,   A stormy sea before her; When, oh I too strong for human hand,   The tempest gathered o'er her.  And still they rowed, amid the roar   Of waters fast prevailing; Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore,   His wrath was changed to wailing.  For sore dismay through storm and shade   His child he did discover; One lovely hand she stretched for aid,   And one was round her lover.  \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief,   \"Across this stormy water; And I'll forgive your Highland chief,   My daughter! O, my daughter!\"  'T was vain: the loud waves lashed the shore,   Return or aid preventing; The waters wild went o'er his child,   And he was left lamenting.                               --Thomas Campbell    ALPHABETICAL LIST OF AUTHORS.

WOLFE, CHARLES 43. KINGSLEY, CHARLES        87. WOTTON, SIR HENRY 44. KNOWLES, SHERIDAN    McGuffey's Fifth Reader    1. THE GOOD READER.  1. It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he was seated one day in his private room, a written petition was brought to him with the request that it should be immediately read.  The King had just returned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some other cause, had so dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make out a single word of the writing.  2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who brought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy servant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was a son of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor reader.  3. In the first place, he did not articulate distinctly. He huddled his words together in the utterance, as if they were syllables of one long word, which he must get through with as speedily as possible. His pronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate his voice so as to bring out the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was uttered with a dismal monotony of voice, as if it did not differ in any respect from that which preceded it.  4. \"Stop!\" said the King, impatiently. \"Is it an auctioneer's list of goods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to me.\" Another page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave the petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his throat in such an affected manner that the King jokingly asked him whether he had not slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the night before.  5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so was not greatly confused by the King's jest. He determined that he would avoid the mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading the petition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word, and prolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so tedious that the King cried out, \"Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the elementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that little girl who is sitting there by the fountain.\"  6. The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of the laborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help her father weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor people in Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat alarmed when she found herself in the King's presence, but took courage when the King told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his eyes were weak.  7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was fond of reading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at her father's house to hear her; those who could not read themselves would come to her, also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and she thus formed the habit of reading various sorts of handwriting promptly and well.  8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through the opening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read, her eyes began to glisten, and her breast to heave. \"What is the matter?\" asked the King; \"don't you know how to read?\" \"Oh, yes! sire,\" she replied, addressing him with the title usually applied to him: \"I will now read it, if you please.\"  9. The two pages wore about to leave the room. \"Remain,\" said the King. The little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor widow, whose only son had been drafted to serve in the army, although his health was delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unfit him for military life. His father had been killed in battle, and the son had a strong"]]]
