IV. with Fig. 1., Fig. 2., Fig. 3., Fig. 4.]     Transcriber's Notes:  DISCLAIMER: This document should NOT be used to engineer any bridge projects! Many typesetting errors were found, and it is possible that there are further errors in the information that were not caught.  Formulas have been provided both as ASCII and TeX following in brackets. Bold headings are handled with equal signs before and after the bold text. Italicised text uses the standard underlines before and after the text. Fractions are expressed in the format: 2-1/4 means two and one quarter.  The page numbers listed below are project page numbers. (The original book used Roman numerals to number the pages.)  Note that the book uses the \"long\" ton equal to 2,240 pounds.  CORRECTIONS MADE:     1. Page 8--the formula for \"d\" must use a cube root, which is how it       is shown here, but the '3' to indicate a cube root is not found in       the original document.    2. Page 8--typo in word 'sectien'--changed to 'section'.    3. Page 10--Value for working comp. strength of cast iron in the       table had a typo (25,v00). Since other values use round numbers,       it is assumed the value should be 25,000.    4. Page 10--Two other typos. Changed 'the the' to 'the', and in       table heading, original word was 'detrution', changed to correct       spelling of 'detrusion'.    5. Page 12--changed 'woooden' to 'wooden'.    6. Page 13--Example II--In the calculations, the intermediate value       in the book was printed as the square root of 67.2. The left part       is correct, but reduces to the square root of 268.8, and that is       ~16.395. So I have corrected the intermediate value.    7. Page 13--Because the original page scan cut off the text on the       right edge, I have made assumptions on what text was missing.       Because the scans came from an outside source, I could not get       the missing information, which was the words at the end of Example       II, and words in the last paragraph of the page.    8. Page 14--Three typos found: 'dimensiens' for 'dimensions', 'betng'       for 'being', and 'ars' for 'are'.    9. Page 17--a value in a formula was printed as 6000, but in the       context of the other information, particularly the example       immediately following, the value was believed to be incorrect, and       was changed to 5000.   10. Page 23--The value of 388 sq. inches at the top of the page in the       book is incorrect; 3 x 8 x 12 = 288, so has been corrected.   11. Page 24--Rods section, numerical value appeared to be 15.000 in       the book, but from context, must be 15,000 instead.   12. Page 28--Typos: changed 'Trautwine's Edgineer's Pocket-Bood' to       Trautwine's Engineer's Pocket-Book'; corrected  'af' to 'as',       'bracas' to 'braces'.   13. Page 30--Apparent typo in the table at the bottom of page.  Value       for Center Brace size for 200' span was shown as '8 x 1', believed       from context of table to be '8 x 10'.   14. Page 33--table of dimensions of a Pratt Truss, last column, row       starting with 150, the original says 8--1-1/8, this is believed to       be, and has been changed to, 3--1-1/8.   15. Page 37--The five formulas with square roots were incorrectly       printed in the book, multiplying the terms inside the square root       instead of adding them, which is obviously incorrect per the       Pythagorean theorem of right triangles.   16. Page 38: The fifth ratio in the group of five near the top of the       page must start with 20, not 10 as in the book   17. Page 38--The equation for W as printed on this page is not       consistent with that found on pages 18 to 24, so has been corrected       from 'bd^2' to 'bd^3'.   18. Page 39--arch brace truss table heading typo-changed 'FOE' to 'FOR'."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],["title","Elsie's Womanhood (#0)"],["body","Team.       ELSIE'S WOMANHOOD  A sequel to \"ELSIE'S GIRLHOOD\"  By MARTHA FINLEY  Complete Authorized Edition  Published by arrangement with Dodd, Mead and Company  _A Burt Book_ BLUE RIBBON BOOKS, Inc.  _New York_     Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by  DODD & MEAD  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.  1903,  BY MARTHA FINLEY  1917,  BY CHARLES B. FINLEY     Preface.   The call for a sequel to \"Elsie's Girlhood\" having become too loud and importunate to be resisted, the pleasant task of writing it was undertaken.  Dates compelled the bringing in of the late war: and it has been the earnest desire and effort of the author to so treat the subject as to wound the feelings of none; to be as impartial as if writing history; and, by drawing a true, though alas, but faint picture, of the great losses and sufferings on both sides, to make the very thought of a renewal of the awful strife _utterly abhorrent_ to every lover of humanity, and especially of this, our own dear native land.  Are we not one people: speaking the same language; worshipping the one true and living God; having a common history, a common ancestry; and united by the tenderest ties of blood? And is not this great grand, glorious old Union--known and respected all over the world--our common country, our joy and pride? O! let us forget all bitterness, and live henceforth in love, harmony, and mutual helpfulness.  For all I know of the Teche country I am indebted to Mr. Edward King's \"Old and New Louisiana\"; for facts and dates in regard to the war, and in large measure for Mr. Dinsmore's views as to its causes, etc., principally to Headley's \"History of the Great Rebellion.\"  The description of Andersonville, and the life led by the prisoners there, was supplied by one who shared it for six months. An effort was made to obtain a sketch of a Northern prison also, but without success.  Yet what need to balance accounts in respect to these matters? The unnatural strife is over, and we are again one united people.  M.F.     CHAPTER FIRST.      \"Oh! there is one affection which no stain        Of earth can ever darken;--when two find,      The softer and the manlier, that a chain        Of kindred taste has fastened mind to mind.\"                                  --PERCIVAL'S POEMS.   In one of the cool green alleys at the Oaks, Rose and Adelaide Dinsmore were pacing slowly to and fro, each with an arm about the other's waist, in girlish fashion, while they conversed together in low, confidential tones.  At a little distance to one side, the young son and heir had thrown himself prone upon the grass in the shade of a magnificent oak, story-book in hand. Much interested he seemed in his book, yet occasionally his eye would wander from its fascinating pages to watch, with pride and delight, the tiny Rosebud steady herself against a tree, then run with eager, tottering steps and a crow of delight into her nurse's outstretched arms, to be hugged, kissed, praised, and coaxed to try it over again.  As Rose and Adelaide turned at one end of the alley, Mr. Horace Dinsmore entered it at the other. Hurriedly approaching the little toddler, he stooped and held out his hands, saying, in tender, half-tremulous tones, \"Come, darling, come to papa.\"  She ran into his arms, crying, \"Papa,\" in her sweet baby voice, and catching her up, he covered her face with kisses; then, holding her clasped fondly to his breast, walked on towards his wife and sister.  \"What is it, Horace?\" asked Rose anxiously, as they neared each other; for she saw that his face was pale and troubled.  \"I bring you strange tidings, my Rose,\" he answered low and sadly, as she laid her hand upon his arm with an affectionate look up into his face.  Hers grew pale. \"Bad news from home?\" she almost gasped.  \"No, no; I've had no word from our absent relatives or friends, and I'm not sure I ought to call it bad news either; though I cannot yet think of it with equanimity, it has come upon me so suddenly.\"  \"What?\" asked both ladies in a breath; \"don't keep us in suspense.\"  \"It has been going on for years--on his part--I can see it now--but, blind fool that I was, I never suspected it till to-day, when it came upon me like a thunderbolt.\"  \"What? who?\"  \"Travilla; after years of patient waiting he has won her at last--our darling--and--and I've given her to him.\"  Both ladies stood dumb with astonishment, while young Horace, who had come running up in time to catch the last words, cried out with vehemence, \"Papa! what! give our Elsie away? how could you? how can we ever do without her? But she shan't go, for she belongs to me too, and I'll _never_ give consent!\"  Mr. Dinsmore and the ladies smiled faintly.  \"They seemed to think mine quite sufficient, Horace,\" replied his father, \"and I'm afraid will hardly consider it necessary to ask yours.\"  \"But, papa, we can't spare her--you know we can't--and why should you go and give her away to Mr. Travilla or anybody?\"  \"My son, had I refused, it would have caused her great unhappiness.\"  \"Then she ought to be ashamed to go and love Mr. Travilla better than you and all of us.\"  \"I was never more astonished in my life!\" cried Adelaide.  \"Nor I,\" said Rose. \"And he's a great deal too old for her.\"  \"That is an objection,\" replied her husband, \"but if not insuperable to her, need not be to us.\"  \"Think of your intimate friend addressing you as father!\" laughed Adelaide; \"it's really too ridiculous.\"  \"That need not be--is not an inevitable consequence of the match,\" smiled Mr. Dinsmore, softly caressing the little one clinging about his neck.  Still conversing on the same subject, the minds of all being full of it to the exclusion of every other, they moved on as if by common consent towards the house.  \"Do you think it can be possible that she is really and truly in love with him?\" queried Rose; \"a man so much older than herself, and so intimate in the family since her early childhood.\"  \"Judge for yourself, my dear,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, as a turn in the path brought them within a few yards of the lovers, who were moving slowly in their direction so that the two parties must meet in another moment.  One glance at the beaming faces, the rich color coming and going in Elsie's cheek, the soft, glad light in her sweet brown eyes, was a sufficient reply to Rose's question. She looked at her husband with a satisfied smile, which he returned.  But little Horace, leaving his father's side, rushed up to Elsie, and catching her hand in his, cried, \"I'll never give my consent! and you belong to me. Mr. Travilla, you can't have her.\"  To the child's surprise Elsie only blushed and smiled, while Mr. Travilla, without the slightest appearance of alarm or vexation, said, \"Ah, my dear boy, you may just as well; for she is willing to be mine and your papa has given her to me.\"  But the others had come up, and inquiring looks, smiles and kindly greetings were exchanged.  \"Mr. Travilla,\" said Rose, half playfully but with a tear trembling in her eye, \"you have stolen a march upon us, and I can hardly forgive you just yet.\"  \"I regret that exceedingly, my dear madam,\" he answered, with a smile that belied his words. \"But Miss Adelaide, you will still stand my friend?\"  \"I don't know,\" she answered demurely; \"there's only one serious objection in my mind (if Elsie is satisfied); that I don't quite fancy having a nephew some years older than myself.\"  \"Ah! well, I shall be quite willing to be considered a brother-in-law.\"  \"Company to dinner!\" shouted Horace. \"I see a carriage; don't you, papa?\"  \"It is your Uncle Edward's,\" said Mr. Travilla.  \"Yes,\" said Adelaide, \"Lora and her tribe are in it, no doubt; and probably Mrs. Bowles too (Carrie Howard you know, Elsie). They have been late in calling.\"  \"Some good reason for it, and they are none the less welcome,\" remarked Rose, quickening her pace.  The one party reached the house just as the other two had fairly alighted, and a scene of joyous greeting ensued.  \"You dear child! how good of you to come back to us again, and single too,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bowles, clasping Elsie in a warm embrace; \"I'd almost given it up, and expected by every mail to hear you had become Lady or Countess this, or Duchess that.\"  Elsie smiled and blushed, and meeting the eye of her betrothed fixed for an instant upon her with an expression of unutterable content, thankfulness, love and pride, smiled and blushed again.  Carrie caught the look and its effect upon her friend, and almost breathless with astonishment, took the first opportunity, after all were seated in the drawing-room, to prefer a whispered request to be taken to Elsie's own private apartment for a moment, to see that her hair and dress were in proper order.  They had come to spend the day, and bonnets and shawls had already been carried away by the servants in attendance.  \"Now girls, don't run off for an interminable chat by yourselves,\" said Mrs. Howard, as the two rose and crossed the room together.  \"No, Aunt Lora, we'll not stay long,\" said Elsie; \"for I want to improve every moment of your visit, in renewing my acquaintance with you and my young cousins.\"  \"Your family has grown, Lora,\" remarked her brother.  \"Yes, rather faster than yours,\" she said, looking round with pride upon her little group of four boys, and a girl yet in her nurse's arms. \"Go and speak to your uncle, Ned, Walter, Horace, and Arthur. You see I have given you a namesake; and this little pet we call Rose Louise, for her two aunties. Yours is Rose, too! and what a darling! and how little Horace has grown!\"  \"Elsie, it can't be possible!\" cried Carrie, the instant they found themselves alone.  \"What can't?\" and Elsie's blush and smile were charming.  \"That you and Mr. Travilla are lovers! I saw it in your faces; but, 'tis too absurd! Why, he's your father's friend, and nearly as old.\"  \"All the wiser and better for that, Carrie, dear. But he is young in heart,"]]]
