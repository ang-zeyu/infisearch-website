A Valuable and Practical Work on Every Department of Household Management. _With Numerous Illustrations_.  The _Guardian_ says: \"AN EXCELLENT WORK, WHICH SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF EVERY HOUSEKEEPER, is CASSELL'S BOOK OF THE HOUSEHOLD. Here we find the most varied information and the soundest of advice. The household, its members and their family life, are considered and discussed; children and their training, health and disease, food and clothing, furnishing, furniture, and household mechanics. The arrangement and treatment of these various subjects are admirable, and the book is certainly a most valuable and practical manual of household management.\"  The _Queen_ says: \"A BOOK SO HANDY AND PRACTICAL OUGHT TO BE ADOPTED BY EVERY WELL-ORDERED FAMILY. Its plan is so comprehensive, it will include every part of the house and its requirements, and all the members of the family and their mutual relations, duties, and responsibilities.\"  The _Weekly Dispatch_ says: \"We do not know of any more practical or more valuable work on household management. It is worth its weight in gold.\"  The _Scotsman_ says: \"The first volume has appeared of a book which promises to be of great and extensive utility. It is A CYCLOPAEDIA OF INFORMATION ON ALL QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF A HOUSEHOLD, and does not enter into comparison with books that treat merely of provisions for the table. Various hands have evidently been employed in working up the various sections, and every subject is dealt with in a thoroughly competent style. The book is admirably appointed in every respect, and contains many illustrations, all of the most useful character, and beautifully printed. EVERY ONE WHO HAS TO DO IN ANY WAY WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF A HOUSEHOLD WILL FIND THIS BOOK INVALUABLE.\"  The _Liverpool Mercury_ says: \"CASSELL'S BOOK OF THE HOUSEHOLD is another book, of a class of which many have been issued, and good books too; but this one, by the thoroughness and comprehensiveness of its arrangement, will go far to render the housewife who possesses it independent of all the rest.... Many a housewife will find the articles interesting enough to be taken up at any leisure hour.\"  The _Glasgow Herald_ says: \"The work promises to be the most complete thing of the kind in existence, and even the first volume by itself is a perfect household encyclopaedia.\"  CASSELL & COMPANY, LIMITED, _Ludgate Hill, London_.         *       *       *       *       *  SAVES TIME, TROUBLE, AND EXPENSE.

The present work, though written upon strictly vegetarian principles, is by no means addressed to vegetarians only. On the contrary, we hope that the following pages of recipes will be read by that enormous class throughout the country who during the last few years have been gradually changing their mode of living by eating far _less_ meat, and taking vegetables and farinaceous food as a substitute.  Where there are thousands who are vegetarians from choice, there are tens of thousands who are virtually vegetarians from necessity. Again, there is another large class who from time to time adopt a vegetarian course of diet on the ground of health, and as a means of escaping from the pains attendant on gout, liver complaint, or dyspepsia.  The class we most wish to reach, however, is that one, increasing we fear, whose whole life is one continual struggle not merely to live, but to live decently.  It may seem a strong statement, but we believe it to be a true one, that only those who have tried a strictly vegetarian course of diet know what real _economy_ means. Should the present work be the means of enabling even one family to become not only better in health but richer in pocket, it will not have been written in vain.  A.G.

Patented in France, 1889. N. S. Wales, 1889. Victoria, 1889. Other Foreign Rights reserved.  CHELSEA TABLE JELLIES,  The Inventor and Patentee, in introducing this high-class article of food, begs to warn the Public that the great success and enormous demand the CHELSEA TABLE JELLIES have obtained in Great Britain has brought many imitators on the Market. A few Stores and Grocers are offering same to the Public, no doubt for the purpose of wishing to appear cheaper, or for making extra profit. The favour for the CHELSEA TABLE JELLY has been obtained solely upon the merits of the article, and it is held to be the greatest invention of the kind, bringing within the reach of all classes this hitherto almost unobtainable luxury. This has been fully endorsed by the unsolicited testimony of high-class British journals.  The article is put up in cardboard boxes, in quantities to make 1/2-pints, pints, and quarts of jelly, and the following are some of the flavours: Lemon, Orange, Vanilla, Calves' Feet, Noyeau, Raspberry, Punch, and Madeira. It should not be confounded with the ordinary fruit Jelly, which is a totally different article, _this being a pure Calves' Feet jelly_, superseding the use of gelatine in packets for jelly purposes--this latter, as will easily be seen, being now a thing of the past. On each box is printed a public analyst's report, also full directions for use.  _The following advantages are claimed over all other Calves Feet jellies_:--  1. It is less than one-third of the price of bottled jellies, and superior in quality.  2. It never gets mildewed or corky.  3. It never fails to set or jellify.  4. Its extreme simpleness of preparation, only requiring to be melted by the addition of hot water, no flavouring or other matter being required.  5. It will keep good for any time until made up, when it will keep good longer than other jellies.  6. The largest quantity can be made in a few minutes.  For persons suffering from dyspepsia or any other ailment, it will also be found to be a great boon, as it can be cut and eaten in the solidified state with great satisfaction. On sea voyages and excursions of any kind it will be found invaluable.  _BEWARE OF SPURIOUS IMITATIONS, and ask only for the_ WALTER ROBERTSON CHELSEA TABLE JELLY.  ARTICLES OF MERIT ARE OFTEN PIRATED BY UNPRINCIPLED TRADERS.  To be had of all GROCERS, STORES, and CONFECTIONERS.   _CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS_.  Sample of CHELSEA TABLE JELLY. Received 1888.  _I certify that the following are the results of the analysis of the above samples_:  I have examined a sample of Chelsea Table jelly, and find it to be a mixture of Calves' Feet jelly and sugar; it is undoubtedly nutritious and wholesome.  It is superior to other samples that I have analysed, as it in much firmer and keeps well.  It is clear and bright, and has evidently been carefully manufactured from pure materials.  It has a pleasant flavour, and is of excellent quality.  _(Signed)_ R. H. HARLAND, F.I,C., F.C.S.  Laboratory, Plough Court, 37, Lombard Street. _Public Analyst_.

GENTLEMEN,--I may inform you that I have tried other makers of jellies, but have found none to equal yours in excellence of quality. I have mentioned this fact frequently to Mr. Seymour Mead and to my friends. I am also deeply indebted to you from the fact that a little niece of mine was fed almost exclusively on your Calves' Feet Jelly for a period of three months, and who, when she refused to take other things, always took most willingly to your jellies.

We wish it to be distinctly understood at starting, that the present work is purely a cookery-book, written on the principles generally adopted by vegetarians; and as, until quite recently, there seemed to be in the minds of many some doubt as to the definition of vegetarianism, we will quote the following explanation from the head of the report of the London Vegetarian Society:--\"The aims of the London Vegetarian Society are to advocate the total disuse of the flesh of animals (fish, flesh, and fowl) as food, and to promote a more extensive use of pulse, grains, fruits, nuts, and other products of the vegetable kingdom, thus propagating a principle tending essentially to true civilisation, to universal humaneness, and to the increase of happiness generally.\"  We have no intention of writing a treatise on vegetarianism, but we consider a few words of explanation necessary.
