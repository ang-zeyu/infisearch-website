Returning, he found Elsie still in the parlor where he had left her.  She was speaking to a servant, \"Go, Prilla, look for the children, and bring them in. It is getting late for them to be out.\"  The girl went, and Elsie saying to her father that Prilla had brought word that Mr. Travilla was now sleeping, begged him to sit down and talk with her for a moment. The tears fell fast as she spoke. It was long since he had seen her so moved.  \"Dear daughter, why distress yourself thus?\" he said, folding her in his arms, and drawing her head to a resting place upon his breast; \"your husband's injuries are not very serious. Dr. Burton is not one to deceive us with false hopes.\"  \"No, papa, oh, how thankful I am to know he is not in danger; but--oh, papa, papa! to think that Eddie did it! that my own son should have so nearly taken his father's life! I grow sick with horror at the very thought!\"  \"Yet it must have been the merest accident, the child almost idolizes his father.\"  \"I had thought so, but he must have been disobeying that father's positive command else this could not have happened. I could never have believed my son could be so disobedient, and it breaks my heart to think of it all.\"  \"The best of us do not always resist temptation successfully, and doubtless in this case it has been very strong. And he is bitterly repenting; I heard him crying somewhere in the grounds as I rode up the avenue, but could not then take time to go to him, not knowing how much you and Travilla might be needing my assistance.\"  \"My poor boy; he does love his father,\" she said, wiping her eyes.  \"There can be no question about that, and this will be a life-long lesson to him.\"  \"Papa, you always bring me comfort,\" she said gratefully. \"And you will stay with us to-night?\"  \"Yes; I could not leave you at such a time. I shall send a note to Rose, to relieve her anxiety in regard to Edward's accident, and let her know that she need not expect me home till morning. Well, Prilla,\" as the girl reappeared, \"what is it? why have you not brought the children as your mistress directed?\"  \"Please, sah, Massa Dinsmore, Mars Eddie won't come; he jes' lie on de ground an' scream an' cry, 'O, I've killed my fader, my dear, dear fader,' an Miss Elsie she comfortin' an' coaxin', an' pleadin', but he won't pay no pretention to nobody.\"  Elsie wept anew. \"My poor child! my poor little son! what am I to do with him?\"  \"I will go to him; trust him to me,\" Mr. Dinsmore said, leaving the room with a quick firm step.     Chapter Fifth.  \"If hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender it here; I do as truly suffer, As e'er I did commit.\" --SHAKESPEARE.   \"O Eddie, dear, do get up and come into the house!\" entreated his sister. \"I must leave you if you don't, for Prilla said mamma had sent for us; and you know we must obey.\"  \"Oh I can't, I can't go in! I can't see mamma! she will never, never love me any more!\"  \"Yes, she will, Eddie; nothing will ever make her stop loving us; and if you're really sorry for having disobeyed poor, dear papa, you'll not go on and disobey her now.\"  \"But oh I've been such a wicked, wicked boy. O Elsie, what shall I do? Jesus won't love me now, nor mamma nor anybody.\"  \"O Eddie,\" sobbed his sister, \"don't talk so. Jesus does love you and will forgive you, if you ask him; and so will mamma and papa; for they both love you and I love you dearly, dearly.\"  The two were alone, Archie having gone home with his father.  A step drew near, and Mr. Dinsmore's voice spoke close at hand in tones sterner and more peremptory than he really meant them to be.  \"Edward, get up from that damp grass and come into the house immediately. Do you intend to add to your poor mother's troubles by your disobedience, and by making yourself sick?\"  The child arose instantly. He was accustomed to yield to his grandfather's authority quite as readily as to that of his parents.  \"O grandpa, please don't be hard to him! His heart's almost broken, and he wouldn't have hurt papa on purpose for all the world,\" pleaded little Elsie, hastening to Mr. Dinsmore's side, taking his hand in both hers, and lifting her tear-dimmed eyes beseechingly to his face.  \"Yes, grandpa ought,\" sobbed Eddie, \"I've been such a wicked, wicked boy, I deserve the dreadfulest whipping that ever was. And papa can't do it now!\" he cried with a fresh burst of grief and remorse, \"and mamma won't like to. Grandpa, it'll have to be you. Please do it quick, 'cause I want it over.\"  \"And has all this distress been for fear of punishment?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, taking the child's hand, and bending down to look searchingly into his face.  \"Oh no, no, no, grandpa! I'd rather be whipped any day than to know I've hurt my dear papa so. Grandpa, won't you do it quick?\"  \"No, my son, I am not fond of such business and shall not punish you unless requested to do so by your father or mother. The doctor hopes your father will be about again in a week or two, and he can then attend to your case himself.\"  \"Oh then he won't die! he won't die, our dear, dear papa!\" cried both children in a breath.  \"No; God has been very good to us all in causing the ball to strike where it could do but little injury. And Edward, I hope this will be such a lesson to you all your life as will keep you from ever disobeying again.\"  They were passing up the avenue, Eddie moving submissively along by his grandfather's side, but with tottering steps; for the dreadful excitement of the last hour had exhausted him greatly. Perceiving this Mr. Dinsmore presently took him in his arms and carried him to the house.  Low pitiful sobs and sighs were the only sounds the little fellow made till set down in the veranda; but then clinging to his grandfather's hand, he burst out afresh, \"O grandpa, I can't go in! I can't, I can't see mamma, for she can't love me any more.\"  The mother heard and came quickly out. The tears were coursing down her cheeks, her mother heart yearned over her guilty, miserable child: stooping down and stretching out her arms, \"Eddie, my little son,\" she said in tender tremulous accents, \"come to mother. If my boy is truly sorry for his sin, mamma has no reproaches for him: nothing but forgiveness and love.\"  He threw himself upon her bosom, \"Mamma, mamma, I am sorry, oh, _so_ sorry! I will never, never disobey papa or you again.\"  \"God helping you, my son; if you trust in your own strength you will be sure to fall.\"  \"Yes mamma; oh, mamma, I've been the wickedest boy! I disobeyed my father and shooted him; and oughtn't I to have a dreadful whipping? Shall grandpa do it?\"  Mrs. Travilla lifted her full eyes inquiringly to her father's face.  \"It is all his own idea,\" said Mr. Dinsmore with emotion, \"I think he has already had a worse punishment by far in his grief and remorse.\"  Elsie heaved a sigh of relief. \"I think his father would say so too; it shall be decided by him when he is able. Eddie, my son, papa is too ill now to say what shall be done with you. I think he does not even know of your disobedience. You will have to wait some days. The suspense will be hard to bear, I know, but my little boy must try to be patient, remembering that he has brought all this suffering on himself. And in the meantime he has mamma's forgiveness and love,\" she added folding him to her heart with a tender caress.  Sorely the children missed their precious half hour with mamma that night, and every night and morning of their papa's illness; she could leave him only long enough each time to give them a few loving words and a kiss all round, and they scarcely saw her through the day--were not admitted to their father's room at all.  But they were very good; lessons went on nearly as usual, little Elsie keeping order in the school-room, even wilful Eddie quietly submitting to her gentle sway, and grandpa kindly attending to the recitations. He rode out with them too, and he, Aunt Rosie or their mammies, took them for a pleasant walk every fine day.  Friends and neighbors were very kind and attentive, none more so than the Lelands. Archie told his father how, and by whom, poor Eddie had been teased, provoked and dared into firing the pistol; Mr. Leland told Mr. Dinsmore the story, and he repeated it to his father and sisters.  The old gentleman was sufficiently incensed against the two culprits to administer a severe castigation to each, while Elsie was thankful to learn that her son had not yielded readily to the temptation to disobedience. She pitied him deeply, as she noted how weary to him were these days of waiting, how his gay spirits had forsaken him, how anxious he was for his father's recovery; how he longed for the time when he should be permitted to go to him with his confession and petition for pardon.  At length that time came. Mr. Travilla was so much better that Dr. Burton said it would do him no harm to see his children, and to hear all the details of his accident.  The others were brought in first and allowed to spend a few minutes in giving and receiving caresses, their little tongues running very fast in their exuberant joy over their restored father.  \"Elsie, Vi, Harold, baby--but where is Eddie?\" he asked, looking a little anxiously at his wife; \"not sick, I hope?\"  \"No, my dear, he will be in presently,\" she answered, the tears starting to her eyes, \"no one of them all has found it harder to be kept away from you than he. But there is something he has begged me to tell you before he comes.\"  \"Ah!\" he said with a troubled look in his eyes, a suspicion of the truth dawning upon him. \"Well, darlings, you may go now, and mamma will let you come in again before your bedtime.\"  They withdrew and Elsie told her story, dwelling more particularly upon the strength of the temptation and the child's agony of grief and remorse.  \"Bring him here, wife,\" Mr. Travilla said, his eyes full, his voice husky with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14566"],["title","Elsie's Motherhood (#7)"],["body","emotion.  There was a sound of sobs in the hall without as she opened the door. \"Come, son,\" she said, taking his hand in hers, \"papa knows it all now.\"  Half eagerly, half tremblingly he suffered her to lead him in.  \"Papa,\" he burst out sobbingly, scarcely daring to lift his eyes from the floor, \"I've been a very wicked, bad boy; I disobeyed you and--and--\"  \"Come here to me, my little son.\" How gentle and tender were the tones.  Eddie lifted his head and with one joyous bound was in his fathers arms, clinging about his neck and sobbing out upon his breast his grief, his joy, his penitence. \"Papa, papa, can you forgive such a naughty disobedient boy? I'm so sorry I did it! I'm so glad you didn't die, dear, dear papa! so glad you love me yet.\"  \"Love you, son? I think if you knew how much, you would never want to disobey again.\"  \"I don't, papa, oh, I don't! I ask God earnestly every day to give me a new heart, and help me always to be good. But mustn't I be punished? mamma said it was for you to say, and grandpa didn't whip me and he won't 'less you ask him.\"  \"And I shall not ask him, my son. I fully and freely forgive you, because I am sure you are very sorry and do not mean to disobey again.\"  How happy the child was that at last his father knew and had forgiven all.  Mr. Travilla improved the occasion for a short but very serious talk with him on the sin and danger of disobedience, and his words, so tenderly spoken, made a deep and lasting impression.  But Eddie was not yet done with the pain and mortification consequent upon his wrong doing. That afternoon the Ashland ladies called bringing with them the elder children of both families. While their mammas conversed in the drawing-room the little people gathered in the veranda.  All was harmony and good-will among them till Philip Ross, fixing his eyes on Eddie, said with a sneer, \"So, Master Ed, though you told me one day you'd never talk to your mamma as I did to mine, you've done a good deal worse. I don't set up for a pattern good boy, but I'd die before I'd shoot my father.\"  Eddie's eyes sought the floor while his lips trembled and two great tears rolled down his burning cheeks.  \"Phil Ross,\" cried Gertrude, \"I'm ashamed of you! of course he didn't do it a-purpose.\"  \"May be not; he didn't disobey on purpose? hadn't his father--\"  But catching a reproachful, entreating look from Elsie's soft, brown eyes, he stopped short and turning away, began to whistle carelessly, while Vi, putting her small arms about Eddie's neck, said, \"Phil Ross, you shouldn't 'sult my brother so, 'cause he wouldn't 'tend to hurt papa; no, not for all the world;\" Harold chiming in, \"'Course my Eddie wouldn't!\" and Bruno, whom he was petting and stroking with his chubby hands, giving a short, sharp bark, as if he too had a word to say in defence of his young master.  \"Is that your welcome to visitors, Bruno?\" queried a young man of eighteen or twenty, alighting from his horse and coming up the steps into the veranda.  \"You must please excuse him for being so ill-mannered, Cousin Cal,\" little Elsie said, coming forward and offering her hand with a graceful courtesy very like her mamma's. \"Will you walk into the drawing-room? our mammas are all there.\"  \"Presently, thank you,\" he said, bending down to snatch a kiss from the sweet lips.  She shrank from the caress almost with aversion.  \"What's the use of being so shy with a cousin?\" he asked, laughing, \"why Molly Percival likes to kiss me.\"  \"I think Molly would not be pleased if she knew you said that,\" remarked the little girl, in a quiet tone, and moving farther from him as she spoke.  \"Holding a levee, eh?\" he said, glancing about upon the group. \"How d'ye, young ladies and gentlemen? Holloa, Ed! so you're the brave fellow that shot his father? Hope your grandfather dealt out justice to you in the same fashion that Wal and Dick's did to them.\"  Eddie could bear no more, but burst into an agony of tears and sobs.  \"Calhoun Conly, do you think it very manly for a big fellow like you to torment such a little one as our Eddie?\" queried Elsie, with rising indignation.  \"No, I don't,\" he said frankly. \"Never mind, Eddie, I take it all back, and own that the other two deserve the lion's share of the blame, and punishment too. Come, shake hands and let's make up.\"  Eddie gave his hand, saying in broken tones, \"I was a naughty boy, but papa has forgiven me, and I don't mean ever to disobey him any more.\"     Chapter Sixth.  \"So false is faction, and so smooth a liar, As that it never had a side entire.\" --DANIEL.   By the first of December Mr. Travilla had entirely recovered from the ill effects of his accident--which had occurred early in November--and life at Ion resumed its usual quiet, regular, but pleasant routine, varied only by frequent exchange of visits with the other families of the connection, and near neighbors, especially the Lelands.  Because of the presence among them of their northern relatives, this winter was made a gayer one than either of the last two, which had seen little mirth or jovialty among the older ones, subdued as they were by recent, repeated bereavements. Time had now somewhat assuaged their grief, and only the widowed ones still wore the garb of mourning.  A round of family parties for old and young filled up the holidays; and again just before the departure of the Rosses and Allisons in the early spring, they were all gathered at Ion for a farewell day together.  Some of the blacks in Mr. Leland's employ had been beaten and otherwise maltreated only the previous night by a band of armed and disguised men, and the conversation naturally turned upon that occurrence.  \"So the Ku Klux outrages have begun in our neighborhood,\" remarked Mr. Horace Dinsmore, and went on to denounce their proceedings in unmeasured terms.  The faces of several of his auditors flushed angrily. Enna shot a fierce glance at him, muttering \"scalawag,\" half under her breath, while his old father said testily, \"Horace, you speak too strongly. I haven't a doubt the rascals deserved all they got. I'm told one of them at least, had insulted some lady, Mrs. Foster, I believe, and that the others had been robbing hen-roosts and smoke-houses.\"  \"That may perhaps be so, but at all events every man has a right to a fair trial,\" replied his son, \"and so long as there is no difficulty in bringing such matters before the civil courts, there is no excuse for Lynch law, which is apt to visit its penalties upon the innocent as well as the guilty.\"  At this, George Boyd, who, as the nephew of the elder Mrs. Carrington and a member of the Ashlands household, had been invited with the others, spoke warmly in defence of the organization, asserting that its main object was to defend the helpless, particularly in guarding against the danger of an insurrection of the blacks.  \"There is not the slightest fear of that,\" remarked Mr. Travilla, \"there may be some few turbulent spirits among them, but as a class they are quiet and inoffensive.\"  \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" said Boyd, \"I find them quite the reverse;--demanding their wages directly they are due, and not satisfied with what one chooses to give. And that reminds me that you, sir, and Mr. Horace Dinsmore, and that carpet-bagger of Fairview are entirely too liberal in the wages you pay.\"  \"That is altogether our own affair, sir,\" returned Mr. Dinsmore, haughtily. \"No man or set of men shall dictate to me as to how I spend my money. What do you say, Travilla?\"  \"I take the same position; shall submit to no such infringement of my liberty to do as I will with my own.\"  Elsie's eyes sparkled: she was proud of her husband and father. Rose, too, smiled approval.  \"Sounds very fine,\" growled Boyd, \"but I say you've no right to put up the price of labor.\"  \"Papa,\" cried young Horace, straightening himself and casting a withering look upon Boyd, \"I hope neither you nor Brother Edward will ever give in to them a single inch. Such insolence!\"  \"Let us change the subject,\" said old Mr. Dinsmore, \"it is not an agreeable one.\"  It so happened that a few days after this Messrs. Dinsmore, Travilla and Leland were talking together just within the entrance to the avenue at Ion when Wilkins Foster, George Boyd and Calhoun Conly came riding by.  They brought their horses to a walk as they neared the gate, and Foster called out sneeringly, \"Two scalawags and a carpet-bagger! fit company for each other.\"  \"So we think, sir,\" returned Travilla coolly, \"though we do not accept the epithets you so generously bestow upon us.\"  \"It is an easy thing to call names; any fool is equal to that,\" said Mr. Leland, in a tone of unruffled good-nature.  \"True; and the weapon of vituperation is generally used by those who lack brains for argument or are upon the wrong side,\" observed Mr. Dinsmore.  \"Is that remark intended to apply to me sir?\" asked Foster, drawing himself up with an air of hauteur and defiance.  \"Not particularly: but if you wish to prove yourself skilled in the other and more manly weapon, we are ready to give you the opportunity.\"  \"Yes; come in, gentlemen, and let us have a free and friendly discussion,\" said Mr. Travilla.  Boyd and Conly at once accepted the invitation, but Foster, reining in his horse in the shade of a tree at the gate, said, \"No, thank you; I don't care to alight, can talk from the saddle as well as anyway. I call you scalawags, Messrs. Dinsmore and Travilla, because though natives of the South, you have turned against her.\"  \"Altogether a mistake,\" observed Travilla.  \"I deny the charge and call upon you to prove it,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.  \"Easy task; you kept away and took no part in our struggle for independence.\"  \"That is we (I speak for Travilla as well as myself) had no share in the effort to overthrow the best government in the world, the hope of the down-trodden and oppressed of all the earth a struggle which we foresaw would prove, as it has, the almost utter destruction of our"]]]
