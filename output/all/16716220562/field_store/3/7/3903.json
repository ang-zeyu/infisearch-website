In another instant Charles was standing in the door, and seeing Patrolman Peter J. Lamb, he drew his gun, and Lamb fell dead. Two other officers, Sergeant Aucoin and Officer Trenchard, who were in the squad, seeing their comrades, Day and Lamb, fall dead, concluded to raise the siege, and both disappeared into an adjoining house, where they blew out their lights so that their cowardly carcasses could be safe from Charles's deadly aim. The calibre of their courage is well shown by the fact that they concluded to save themselves from any harm by remaining prisoners in that dark room until daybreak, out of reach of Charles's deadly rifle. Sergeant Aucoin, who had been so brave a few hours before when seeing the two colored men sitting on the steps, talking together on Dryades Street, and supposing that neither was armed, now showed his true calibre. Now he knew that Charles had a gun and was brave enough to use it, so he hid himself in a room two hours while Charles deliberately walked out of his room and into the street after killing both Lamb and Day. It is also shown, as further evidence of the bravery of some of New Orleans' \"finest,\" that one of them, seeing Capt. Day fall, ran seven blocks before he stopped, afterwards giving the excuse that he was hunting for a patrol box.  At daybreak the officers felt safe to renew the attack upon Charles, so they broke into his room, only to find that--what they probably very well knew--he had gone. It appears that he made his escape by crawling through a hole in the ceiling to a little attic in his house. Here he found that he could not escape except by a window which led into an alley, which had no opening on 4th Street. He scaled the fence and was soon out of reach.  It was now 5 o'clock Tuesday morning, and a general alarm was given. Sergeant Aucoin and Corporal Trenchard, having received a new supply of courage by returning daylight, renewed their effort to capture the man that they had allowed to escape in the darkness. Citizens were called upon to participate in the man hunt and New Orleans was soon the scene of terrible excitement. Officers were present everywhere, and colored men were arrested on all sides upon the pretext that they were impertinent and \"game niggers.\" An instance is mentioned in the _Times-Democrat_ of the twenty-fifth and shows the treatment which unoffending colored men received at the hands of some of the officers. This instance shows Corporal Trenchard, who displayed such remarkable bravery on Monday night in dodging Charles's revolver, in his true light. It shows how brave a white man is when he has a gun attacking a Negro who is a helpless prisoner. The account is as follows:    The police made some arrests in the neighborhood of the killing of the   two officers. Mobs of young darkies gathered everywhere. These Negroes   talked and joked about the affair, and many of them were for starting a   race war on the spot. It was not until several of these little gangs   amalgamated and started demonstrations that the police commenced to   act. Nearly a dozen arrests were made within an hour, and everybody in   the vicinity was in a tremor of excitement.    It was about 1 o'clock that the Negroes on Fourth Street became very   noisy, and George Meyers, who lives on Sixth Street, near Rampart,   appeared to be one of the prime movers in a little riot that was rapidly   developing. Policeman Exnicios and Sheridan placed him under arrest, and   owing to the fact that the patrol wagon had just left with a number of   prisoners, they walked him toward St. Charles Avenue in order to get a   conveyance to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.    A huge crowd of Negroes followed the officers and their prisoners.   Between Dryades and Baronne, on Sixth, Corporal Trenchard met the trio.   He had his pistol in his hand and he came on them running. The Negroes   in the wake of the officers, and prisoner took to flight immediately.   Some disappeared through gates and some over fences and into yards, for   Trenchard, visibly excited, was waving his revolver in the air and was   threatening to shoot. He joined the officers in their walk toward St.   Charles Street, and the way he acted led the white people who were   witnessing the affair to believe that his prisoner was the wanted Negro.   At every step he would punch him or hit him with the barrel of his   pistol, and the onlookers cried, \"Lynch him!\" \"Kill him!\" and other   expressions until the spectators were thoroughly wrought up. At St.   Charles Street Trenchard desisted, and, calling an empty ice wagon,   threw the Negro into the body of the vehicle and ordered Officer   Exnicios to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.    The ride to the station was a wild one. Exnicios had all he could do to   watch his prisoner. A gang climbed into the wagon and administered a   terrible thrashing to the black en route. It took a half hour to reach   the police station, for the mule that was drawing the wagon was not   overly fast. When the station was reached a mob of nearly 200 howling   white youths was awaiting it. The noise they made was something   terrible. Meyers was howling for mercy before he reached the ground. The   mob dragged him from the wagon, the officer with him. Then began a   torrent of abuse for the unfortunate prisoner.    The station door was but thirty feet away, but it took Exnicios nearly   five minutes to fight his way through the mob to the door. There were no   other officers present, and the station seemed to be deserted. Neither   the doorman nor the clerk paid any attention to the noise on the   outside. As the result, the maddened crowd wrought their vengeance on   the Negro. He was punched, kicked, bruised and torn. The clothes were   ripped from his back, while his face after that few minutes was   unrecognizable.  This was the treatment accorded and permitted to a helpless prisoner because he was black. All day Wednesday the man hunt continued. The excitement caused by the deaths of Day and Lamb became intense. The officers of the law knew they were trailing a man whose aim was deadly and whose courage they had never seen surpassed. Commenting upon the marksmanship of the man which the paper styled a fiend, the _Times-Democrat_ of Wednesday said:    One of the extraordinary features of the tragedy was the marksmanship   displayed by the Negro desperado. His aim was deadly and his coolness   must have been something phenomenal. The two shots that killed Captain   Day and Patrolman Lamb struck their victims in the head, a circumstance   remarkable enough in itself, considering the suddenness and fury of the   onslaught and the darkness that reigned in the alley way.    Later on Charles fired at Corporal Perrier, who was standing at least   seventy-five yards away. The murderer appeared at the gate, took   lightning aim along the side of the house, and sent a bullet whizzing   past the officer's ear. It was a close shave, and a few inches'   deflection would no doubt have added a fourth victim to the list.    At the time of the affray there is good reason to believe that Charles   was seriously wounded, and at any event he had lost quantities of blood.   His situation was as critical as it is possible to imagine, yet he shot   like an expert in a target range. The circumstance shows the desperate   character of the fiend, and his terrible dexterity with weapons makes   him one of the most formidable monsters that has ever been loose upon   the community.  Wednesday New Orleans was in the hands of a mob. Charles, still sought for and still defending himself, had killed four policemen, and everybody knew that he intended to die fighting. Unable to vent its vindictiveness and bloodthirsty vengeance upon Charles, the mob turned its attention to other colored men who happened to get in the path of its fury. Even colored women, as has happened many times before, were assaulted and beaten and killed by the brutal hoodlums who thronged the streets. The reign of absolute lawlessness began about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. The mob gathered near the Lee statue and was soon making its way to the place where the officers had been shot by Charles. Describing the mob, the _Times-Democrat_ of Thursday morning says:    The gathering in the square, which numbered about 700, eventually became   in a measure quiet, and a large, lean individual, in poor attire and   with unshaven face, leaped upon a box that had been brought for the   purpose, and in a voice that under no circumstances could be heard at a   very great distance, shouted: \"Gentlemen, I am the Mayor of Kenner.\" He   did not get a chance for some minutes to further declare himself, for   the voice of the rabble swung over his like a huge wave over a sinking   craft. He stood there, however, wildly waving his arms and demanded a   hearing, which was given him when the uneasiness of the mob was quieted   for a moment or so.    \"I am from Kenner, gentlemen, and I have come down to New Orleans   tonight to assist you in teaching the blacks a lesson. I have killed a   Negro before, and in revenge of the wrong wrought upon you and yours, I   am willing to kill again. The only way that you can teach these Niggers   a lesson and put them in their place is to go out and lynch a few of   them as an object lesson. String up a few of them, and the others will   trouble you no more. That is the only thing to do--kill them, string   them up, lynch them! I will lead you, if you will but follow. On to the   Parish Prison and lynch Pierce!\"    They bore down on the Parish Prison like an avalanche, but the avalanche   split harmlessly on the blank walls of the jail, and Remy Klock sent out   a brief message: \"You can't have Pierce, and you can't get in.\" Up to   that time the mob had had no opposition, but Klock's answer chilled them   considerably."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],["title","Mob Rule in New Orleans (#3)"],["body"," was no deep-seated desperation in the crowd after   all, only, that wild lawlessness which leads to deeds of cruelty, but   not to stubborn battle. Around the corner from the prison is a row of   pawn and second-hand shops, and to these the mob took like the ducks to   the proverbial mill-pond, and the devastation they wrought upon Mr.   Fink's establishment was beautiful in its line.    Everything from breast pins to horse pistols went into the pockets of   the crowd, and in the melee a man was shot down, while just around the   corner somebody planted a long knife in the body of a little newsboy for   no reason as yet shown. Every now and then a Negro would be flushed   somewhere in the outskirts of the crowd and left beaten to a pulp. Just   how many were roughly handled will never be known, but the unlucky   thirteen had been severely beaten and maltreated up to a late hour, a   number of those being in the Charity Hospital under the bandages and   courtplaster of the doctors.  The first colored man to meet death at the hands of the mob was a passenger on a street car. The mob had broken itself into fragments after its disappointment at the jail, each fragment looking for a Negro to kill. The bloodthirsty cruelty of one crowd is thus described by the _Times-Democrat_:    \"We will get a Nigger down here, you bet!\" was the yelling boast that   went up from a thousand throats, and for the first time the march of the   mob was directed toward the downtown sections. The words of the rioters   were prophetic, for just as Canal Street was reached a car on the   Villere line came along.    \"Stop that car!\" cried half a hundred men. The advance guard, heeding   the injunction, rushed up to the slowly moving car, and several, seizing   the trolley, jerked it down.    \"Here's a Nigro!\" said half a dozen men who sprang upon the car.    The car was full of passengers at the time, among them several women.   When the trolley was pulled down and the car thrown in total darkness,   the latter began to scream, and for a moment or so it looked as if the   life of every person in the car was in peril, for some of the crowd with   demoniacal yells of \"There he goes!\" began to fire their weapons   indiscriminately. The passengers in the car hastily jumped to the ground   and joined the crowd, as it was evidently the safest place to be.    \"Where's that Nigger?\" was the query passed along the line, and with   that the search began in earnest. The Negro, after jumping off the car,   lost himself for a few moments in the crowd, but after a brief search he   was again located. The slight delay seemed, if possible, only to whet   the desire of the bloodthirsty crowd, for the reappearance of the Negro   was the signal for a chorus of screams and pistol shots directed at the   fugitive. With the speed of a deer, the man ran straight from the corner   of Canal and Villere to Customhouse Street. The pursuers, closely   following, kept up a running fire, but notwithstanding the fact that   they were right at the Negro's heels their aim was poor and their   bullets went wide of the mark.    The Negro, on reaching Customhouse Street, darted from the sidewalk out   into the middle of the street. This was the worst maneuver that he could   have made, as it brought him directly under the light from an arc lamp,   located on a nearby corner. When the Negro came plainly in view of the   foremost of the closely following mob they directed a volley at him.   Half a dozen pistols flashed simultaneously, and one of the bullets   evidently found its mark, for the Negro stopped short, threw up his   hands, wavered for a moment, and then started to run again. This stop,   slight as it was, proved fatal to the Negro's chances, for he had not   gotten twenty steps farther when several of the men in advance of the   others reached his side. A burly fellow, grabbing him with one hand,   dealt him a terrible blow on the head with the other. The wounded man   sank to the ground. The crowd pressed around him and began to beat him   and stamp him. The men in the rear pressed forward and those beating the   man were shoved forward. The half-dead Negro, when he was freed from his   assailants, crawled over to the gutter. The men behind, however, stopped   pushing when those in front yelled, \"We've got him,\" and then it was   that the attack on the bleeding Negro was resumed. A vicious kick   directed at the Negro's head sent him into the gutter, and for a moment   the body sank from view beneath the muddy, slimy water. \"Pull him out;   don't let him drown,\" was the cry, and instantly several of the men   around the half-drowned Negro bent down and drew the body out. Twisting   the body around they drew the head and shoulders up on the street, while   from the waist down the Negro's body remained under the water. As soon   as the crowd saw that the Negro was still alive they again began to beat   and kick him. Every few moments they would stop and striking matches   look into the man's face to see if he still lived. To better see if he   was dead they would stick lighted matches to his eyes. Finally,   believing he was dead they left him and started out to look for other   Negroes. Just about this time some one yelled, \"He ain't dead,\" and the   men came back and renewed the attack. While the men were beating and   pounding the prostrate form with stones and sticks a man in the crowd   ran up, and crying, \"I'll fix the d--- Negro,\" poked the muzzle of a   pistol almost against the body and fired. This shot must have ended the   man's life, for he lay like a stone, and realizing that they were   wasting energy in further attacks, the men left their victim lying in   the street.  The same paper, on the same day, July 26, describes the brutal butchery of an aged colored man early in the morning:    Baptiste Philo, a Negro, seventy-five years of age, was a victim of mob   violence at Kerlerec and North Peters Streets about 2:30 o'clock this   morning. The old man is employed about the French Market, and was on his   way there when he was met by a crowd and desperately shot. The old man   found his way to the Third Precinct police station, where it was found   that he had received a ghastly wound in the abdomen. The ambulance was   summoned and he was conveyed to the Charity Hospital. The students   pronounced the wound fatal after a superficial examination.  Mob rule continued Thursday, its violence increasing every hour, until 2 p.m., when the climax seemed to be reached. The fact that colored men and women had been made the victims of brutal mobs, chased through the streets, killed upon the highways and butchered in their homes, did not call the best element in New Orleans to active exertion in behalf of law and order. The killing of a few Negroes more or less by irresponsible mobs does not cut much figure in Louisiana. But when the reign of mob law exerts a depressing influence upon the stock market and city securities begin to show unsteady standing in money centers, then the strong arm of the good white people of the South asserts itself and order is quickly brought out of chaos.  It was so with New Orleans on that Thursday. The better element of the white citizens began to realize that New Orleans in the hands of a mob would not prove a promising investment for Eastern capital, so the better element began to stir itself, not for the purpose of punishing the brutality against the Negroes who had been beaten, or bringing to justice the murderers of those who had been killed, but for the purpose of saving the city's credit. The _Times-Democrat_, upon this phase of the situation on Friday morning says:    When it became known later in the day that State bonds had depreciated   from a point to a point and a half on the New York market a new phase of   seriousness was manifest to the business community. Thinking men   realized that a continuance of unchecked disorder would strike a body   blow to the credit of the city and in all probability would complicate   the negotiation of the forthcoming improvement bonds. The bare thought   that such a disaster might be brought about by a few irresponsible boys,   tramps and ruffians, inflamed popular indignation to fever pitch. It was   all that was needed to bring to the aid of the authorities the active   personal cooperation of the entire better element.  With the financial credit of the city at stake, the good citizens rushed to the rescue, and soon the Mayor was able to mobilize a posse of 1,000 willing men to assist the police in maintaining order, but rioting still continued in different sections of the city. Colored men and women were beaten, chased and shot whenever they made their appearance upon the street. Late in the night a most despicable piece of villainy occurred on Rousseau Street, where an aged colored woman was killed by the mob. The _Times-Democrat_ thus describes, the murder:    Hannah Mabry, an old Negress, was shot and desperately wounded shortly   after midnight this morning while sleeping in her home at No. 1929   Rousseau Street. It was the work of a mob, and was evidently well   planned so far as escape was concerned, for the place was reached by   police officers, and a squad of the volunteer police within a very short   time after the reports of the shots, but not a prisoner was secured. The   square was surrounded, but the mob had scattered in several directions,   and, the darkness of the neighborhood aiding them, not one was taken.    At the time the mob made the attack on the little house there were also   in it David Mabry, the sixty-two-year-old husband of the wounded woman;   her son, Harry Mabry; his wife, Fannie, and an infant child. The young   couple with their babe could not be found after the whole affair was   over, and they either escaped or were hustled off by the mob. A careful   search of the whole neighborhood was made, but no trace of them could be   found.    The little "]]]
