We are compounded of soul and body, but who explain the connexion; tell us the essence of either the one or the other, or define the principles on which the soul commands the body? We are lost in ourselves, and in all the objects which surround us.  Whatever God hath declared, we are bound to believe because he hath declared it; and whatever he hath enjoined, we are bound to do because he hath enjoined it, though the reasons of his injunctions may not be revealed. God is under no obligations to explain matters to us. \"God is greater than man. Why dost thou strive with him? He giveth not account of his matters.\"  Others object because the Gospel is not sent to all nations. That God should be supposed to communicate to some, and not to others they allege to be unreasonable and sufficient to destroy its credit; especially, as the book which claims to be a revelation teacheth that \"there it no respect of persons with God.\"  That God makes his creatures to differ respecting talents and advantages, is a truth not to be denied. Those who on this account, object to the truth of the gospel, will not deny it. If God makes differences respecting every thing else, why not respecting religion? Where is the injustice or impropriety of trying some with gospel advantages; others only with the light of nature? If requirements vary with betrustments, none have reason to complain; and that this is the case is plainly the language of revelation.*  With equal reason might the hand of God in creation be denied, because different grades are found among creatures, and some have greatly the advantage over others; and in providence because its distributions are unequal. That these inequalities are observable, and that they are the work of God, will be acknowledged by all who believe the being of a God, and his providential government. If any are disposed to call these in question, we turn from them. To reason with them would be in vain. \"That which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.\"  * Vid. Discourse on Romans, ii. 11.  A scoffing age may cry out against Christianity. To some it may be a \"stumbling block; to others foolishness.\" Men may exclaim against the gospel, and against the doctrines and duties of it, and the means which have been used of God to propagate it. Still \"the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\" So it hath been in times past; so it will be in times to come. _The foolish, the weak and base things of the world, have confounded and brought to nought, all the world termed wise, and great, and mighty_.  Imperial Rome at the summit of her greatness, could not crush the cause of him who died on Calvary! \"Had this counsel or work been of men, it would have come to nought.\" Probably the name of Jesus, would long ere now have perished from the earth. But all his enemies could do nothing effectually against him. They could only do what God's counsel had determined to be done.  Christianity hath still its enemies; of the same character with those of old. They have overthrown the faith of some. Others they may seduce. That \"scoffers should arise, in the last days walking after their own lusts; that some should deny the Lord that bought them, and that many should follow their pernicious ways,\" were foretold by an inspired apostle, and \"they turned to us for a testimony.\"  We are called a Christian people. \"If we believe the gospel, happy are we if we obey it.\" The generality profess to believe it. But how is it received? Do not many neglect it? Do not some who assent to its truth, \"go their way to their farms, or their merchandize,\" regardless of it, neither confessing Christ before men, nor seeking an interest in him?  If the gospel is from God, to such neglecters Of the grace it offers, it must be \"a favor of death unto death!\" And is not their number great? Doth it not increase from year to year, from age to age? To these who are taken up with sensual pleasures, and with minding only earthly things, St. Paul would say \"even weeping you are enemies to the cross of Christ, and your end will be destruction.\"  Let us be persuaded to bring home these considerations to ourselves. We are deeply interested in them. \"The secrets of our hearts will ere long be judged by the gospel of Christ.\" To those who will not receive and obey the gospel, we have only to say, \"Notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\"     * * * * * *    SERMON III.  The Declensions of Christianity, an Argument of its Truth..  Luke xviii. 8.  When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?   \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but be that believeth not shall be damned.\" So certified the risen Savior. Faith is made a condition of salvation. But God requires only a reasonable service. He must then have given evidence of the truth to which He requires assent. He hath given it abundantly; Christians \"are compassed about with a cloud of witnesses.\"  The proofs of Christianity are of two kinds; external and internal. Both are strong. United they leave infidelity without excuse.  Of external, the chief are miracles and prophecy. Miracles carried conviction to beholders; and were designed to give credibility to special messengers. Prophecy is a standing evidence, by which testimony is borne to the truth of revelation; yea, it is a growing evidence, which gains strength by every fulfillment.  Some may envy those who lived in this age of miracles supposing them sufficient to banish every doubt. But the proof arising from the fulfillment of prophecy, which we enjoy above them, is equal if not superior to theirs.  The prophecies contain sketches of the history of man, and of the plan of providence, from their respective dates to the end of the world. Those which relate _to the declensions of religion, which were to take place under the gospel dispensation_, will now only be considered.  From those declensions, arguments are drawn against the truth of Christianity. Was Christianity from God, he would verify the declaration made by him who claimed to be his Son. _The gates of Hell shall not prevail against it_. But they do prevail. What was once said of its author, _Behold the world is gone after him,_ will now apply to its enemy. This religion is not therefore from God, but of man's device. Propt up as it is, by human laws, and supported by \"the powers that be,\" it totters towards ruin. Left to itself, it would soon fall and come to nought.  Such are the proud vauntings of infidelity, when \"iniquity abounds and the love of many waxeth cold.\" So when Christ hung on the cross, and when he slept in the tomb, ignorant of consequences, his disciples \"wept and lamented, and the world rejoiced;\" but the time was short. Soon the world was confounded and the \"sorrow of his disciples was turned into joy.\" IF the declensions which we witness, are foretold in scripture, they are no occasion of surprize.  Yea, instead of weakening our faith, they may reasonably increase it. And when we consider the assurances given us, that these declensions were to antecede the universal prevalence of true religion; they may also serve to increase our hope.  To _shew that these declensions are foretold, and that we may expect yet greater abominations, than have hitherto appeared_, is attempted in the following discourse.  When _the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth_?  That Christ is here intended by the Son of man; and that faith will be rare among men at the coming of his, referred to, are not doubtful matters. But what coming of Christ is here referred to? This is first to be ascertained.  The coming of Christ refers in the scripture, to several events. Sometimes to his incarnation; sometimes to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the Jewish polity; sometimes to his coming to judgment; and sometimes to the beginning of that universal dominion which he is to exercise on earth in the latter days. Each of these is the subject of several prophecies.  Christ's incarnation, or his coming to dwell with men, and to obey and suffer for their redemption, was a principal subject of the old testament prophecies. \"To him gave all the prophets witness.\"  The divine justice executed on the Jews, in the destruction of their chief city, and polity, is also termed Christ's coming. This was the subject of several prophecies of old. It was foretold by Moses, and sundry others who lived before the gospel day; but more particularly by Christ, in person just before his sufferings. To this event the desolations foretold in the twenty fourth of Matthew, and its parallels in the other gospels, had a primary reference. The metaphors used to describe it are strong. They have been supposed to refer to the general judgment; and they have, no doubt an ultimate reference to it. But they refer, more immediately to another coming of Christ; his coming to render to the Jews according to their demerits as a people, soon after they should have filled up the measure of their iniquity by his crucifixion; which by the circumstances attending it, became a national act.  That this coming of Christ was particularly intended in those predictions, is, from several considerations apparent. That the Christians of that age, who were conversant with the apostles, and instructed by them, received this to be the meaning of those prophecies, and that they fled at the approach of the Roman armies, and escaped the destruction which came on the Jews, are matters of notoriety. And that this was the primary meaning of those prophecies, is further evident from an express declaration which they contain; \"_Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away till all these things be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15031"],["title","Sermons on Various Important Subjects (#5)"],["body","lfilled_.\" This closeth the prophecy. The whole must therefore have received a primary accomplishment, \"before that generation did pass away.\" This was fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.  Christ's coming to judgment, is often foretold in every part of the new testament, to pass over the intimations given of it in the old. But none of these can be _the coming of the Son of man_, referred to in the text. That it cannot refer to his incarnation is evident, from the time in which the declaration in the text was made. His coming in the flesh had been then accomplished.  Neither can it refer to his coming to punish Jewish apostasy and ingratitude; or to his coming to judge the world in righteousness, because the moral state of the world at neither to those periods, answers to the description here given. _Shall he find faith on the earth_?  The ruin of the Jews by the Roman armies, happened about thirty six years after Christ's crucifixion. Long ere that time the spirit had been poured out, and many had embraced the gospel. The apostles and evangelists, had gone, not only to \"the lost sheep of the house of Israel, but also into the way of the Gentiles;\" had called \"those who were afar off, as well as those who were near; their sound had gone into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\" Neither had they labored among the Gentiles in vain. St. Paul spake by the Spirit when he declared to the Jews that the salvation of God was sent unto the Gentiles, and they would hear it. His word was verified. \"Many were added to the Lord, and the number of the disciples was multiplied.\"  Such was the state of the world, at that _coming of the Son of man. Faith was then to be found on the earth_, if not among Jews.  When Christ shall come to judgment, we have reason to believe, that faith will also be found on earth; and more than at that period we have now considered.  The scriptures of both testaments, abound with predictions of the universal prevalence of religion, in the latter days; of the whole worlds rejoicing under the auspicious government of the Prince of Peace; of restraints laid on the powers of darkness, that they should not deceive and seduce mankind. And though we are taught that \"the old serpent will afterwards be loosed, for a little season, and go forth to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth,\" we have no intimation that the main body of the Church will be corrupted by his influence, or injured by his power. His adherents may \"compass the camp of the saints, and the beloved city,\" but will make no attack upon them. \"Fire will come down from God out of heaven, and destroy them.\" By some special, perhaps miraculous interpolation of providence, the people of God will be protected and delivered.  St. john, who gives more particulars of the latter day glory, than those who had gone before him, fixes the term Christ's reign on earth a thousand years, which he represents to be those _next preceding_ the judgment. And agreeably to the statement which he hath made, a numerous body of saints will then be found to welcome their Lord, and rejoice before him at his coming.  To this agree the other prophets who treat of this subject. No other limits the term of Christ's reign; or mentions Satan's being enlarged and permitted any measure of deceptive influence, after the restraints laid upon him at the beginning Christ's reign. But others foretell the happy day, and several seem to dwell delightfully upon it, and represent it as continuing to the end of time; and none give the remotest hint that it is to terminate, and iniquity again to become universally prevalent.  Isaiah often mentions it, and dilates more largely upon it than any other who lived before the gospel day. From his representations we should expect it to terminate _only with time_. \"I will make the an _eternal_ excellency--violence shall _no more be heard_ in thy land; wasting nor destruction within thy borders--the sun shall be _no more_ thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be unto thee _an everlasting light_, and thy God thy glory--the days of thy mourning _shall be ended_--thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land _forever_.\"  By the little horn in Daniel's vision, Antichrist is doubtless intended. When at his fall Christ is to take the kingdom; or it is to be given to his people, it is to be an abiding kingdom. \"And there was given unto him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages, should serve him; _his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, an his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed_.\"  This is a prophecy of the universal prevalence of true religion in the last days, after the reign of Antichrist shall have come to an end. By the explanation in the latter part of the chapter, the saints are from that period to have the dominion. It is no more to be taken from them. \"The saints of the most high shall take the kingdom, and _possess the kingdom for ever, even forever and ever_--and the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high, _whose kingdom is an ever lasting kingdom_, and all dominion shall serve and obey him.\"  These representations agree with that made to St. John, who saw the church guarded and protected from infernal power and influence, at the close of the millennium. The only difference consists in the mention of a few particulars by the apostle, which were not communicated to the prophets; such as the term of Christ's reign on earth; and some fruitless attempts of the powers of darkness against his people, after that term shall have expired.  The coming to judgment cannot therefore be intended in the text. _There will then be faith on the earth_. But if we consider \"that which is noted in the scripture of truth,\" respecting the moral state of the world before and at the time of Christ's coming to reign upon it, we shall find it answering to this description.  We will therefore, first take a general view _of the prophecies respecting the moral state of the world, under the gospel dispensation? Then a more particular view of the great declensions which were to take place, with a special reference to the state of religion at the approach of the latter day glory_.  The Savior, in person, and by his Spirit, gave general intimations to the apostles, of the times which were to pass over them, and over his church. When they were ordered to preach the gospel in all the world, beginning at Jerusalem, they were forewarned that the Jews would reject their testimony, and persecute them, as they had persecuted their Lord--that soon after \"there would be great distress in that land, and wrath upon that people--that they would fall by the sword; be led captive into all nations, and that Jerusalem would be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled.\"  The comforter which was to \"teach them all things,\" not only explaining the nature of Christianity, and causing them to understand it, but also to unveil futurity before them, taught them, that after the Jews had rejected the gospel, the Gentiles would receive it, and the church grow and become great; that a falling away would afterwards follow, which would spread wide, and continue for a longtime, till it became nearly total; that when such was the state of the church, Christ would come, take the kingdom, and reign on earth.  Such were the outlines of futurity, relative to Christianity, as sketched out before the apostles. But if we descend to particulars, and examine the prophecies with attention, we shall find that the defections, which were to take place antecedent to the reign of the Redeemer, were to be of two kinds--that they were to arise at different times, and from different sources--that one was to be a corruption of religion, the other a rejection of it--that the former was to antecede and prepare the way for the latter.  This will be the subject: of another discourse.     * * * * * *    SERMON IV.  _The Declensions of Christianity, an Argument of its Truth_.  Luke xviii. 8.  \"_When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth_?\"   That the coming of the Son of man, is here intended of Christ's coming at the commencement of the latter day glory, hath been alleged in the preceding discourse, and several considerations adduced in proof. Additional evidence will arise from a view of the prophecies _relative to the great declensions_ which were to take place in the church, during the gospel day. These, we observed, are of two kinds, one, a _corruption of religion_, the other _its rejection_.  The intimations given of them in the new testament, are chiefly found in the writings of St, Paul, Peter and John. They are noticed also by Jude. The two former suffered martyrdom under Nero. When the time of their departure drew nigh, they had separately a view of the then future state of the church; \"particularly of the declension which were to take place in the kingdoms of this world, shall become the kingdom of our Lord and Christ.\" St. John had the same opened to his view in the isle of Patmos.  St. Paul in his second epistle to the Thessalonians, after rectifying the mistake of those who thought the day of judgment then at hand, proceeded to inform them that there would be great declensions in the church before the end of the world. \"Let no man deceive you, by any means, for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped; so that as God, he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.\" The antichristian defection is here evidently intended. The apostle toucheth on the same subject in his first epistle to Timothy, and"]]]
