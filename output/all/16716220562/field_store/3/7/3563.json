Three ports, besides six days' leave in London.\"  \"You had plenty of time ashore before that,\" replied Jack.  \"Maybe I did. But I'd like to have some more. Besides, this isn't very exciting business.\"  Night fell again, and still nothing had happened to break the quiet monotony of the trip. Lights of trawlers flashed up ahead. Interest on the bridge picked up.  \"Object off the port bow,\" called the lookout.  \"Looks like a periscope,\" reported the quartermaster.  Frank snapped his binoculars on a bobbing black spar.  \"Buoy and fishnet,\" he decided after a quick scrutiny.  Frank kept the late watch that night. At 4 a.m. he turned in. At five he climbed hastily from his bunk at the jingle of general alarm, and reached the bridge on the run in time to see the exchange of recognition signals with a British man-o'-war, which vessel had run into a submarine while the latter was on the surface in a fog. The warship had just rammed the U-boat.  \"Can we help you?\" Frank called across the water.  \"Thanks. Drop a few depth charges,\" was the reply.  This was done, but nothing came of it Frank returned to his bunk.  \"Pretty slow life, this, if you ask me,\" he told himself.  He went back to sleep.     CHAPTER II  THE BOY CAPTAIN AND HIS LIEUTENANT   The U.S.S. Plymouth was Jack Templeton's first command. He had been elevated to the rank of captain only a few weeks before. Naturally he was not a little proud of his vessel. When Jack was given his ship, it was only natural, too, that Frank Chadwick, who had been his associate and chum through all the days of the great war, should become Jack's first officer.  In spite of the fact that Jack's rating as captain was in the British navy, he was at this moment in command of an American vessel. This came about through a queer combination of circumstances.  The American commander of the Plymouth had been taken suddenly ill. At almost the same time the Plymouth had been ordered to proceed from Dover to Liverpool to join other American vessels. Almost on the eve of departure, the first officer also was taken ill. It was to him the command naturally would have fallen in the captain's absence. The second officer was on leave of absence. Thus, without a skipper, the Plymouth could not have sailed.  Jack and Frank had recently returned with a British convoy from America. They were in Dover at the time. From his sick bed in a hospital, the captain of the Plymouth had appealed to the British naval authorities. In spite of the fact that he was in no condition to leave when he received his orders, he did not wish to deny his crew the privilege of seeing active service, which the call to Liverpool, he knew, meant.  The captain's appeal had been turned over to Lord Hastings, now connected prominently with the British admiralty. Lord Hastings, in the early days of the war, had been the commander under whom Jack and Frank had served. In fact, the lads were visiting the temporary quarters of Lord Hastings in Dover when the appeal was received from the commander of the Plymouth.  \"How would you like to tackle this job, Jack?\" Lord Hastings asked.  \"I'd like it,\" the lad replied, \"if you think I can do it, sir.\"  \"Of course you can do it,\" was Lord Hastings' prompt reply. \"I haven't sailed with you almost four years for nothing.\"  \"You mean, sir,\" replied Jack with a smile, \"that I haven't sailed with you that long for nothing.\"  \"That's more like it, Jack,\" put in Frank laughingly. \"I've learned a few things from Lord Hastings myself.\"  \"It is hardly probable,\" continued Lord Hastings, \"that your promotion has been unearned, Jack. No, I believe you can fill the bill.\"  \"In that case, I shall be glad to take command of the Plymouth temporarily, sir.\"  \"And how about me?\" Frank wanted to know. \"Where do I come in, sir?\"  \"Why,\" said Lord Hastings, \"I have no doubt it can be arranged so you can go along as first officer. I understand the first officer of the Plymouth is also under the weather.\"  \"But isn't all this a bit irregular, sir?\" Jack asked.  \"Very much so,\" was Lord Hastings' reply. \"At the same time, many precedents are being broken every day, and I can see no reason why two British officers cannot lend their services to an ally if they are asked to do so.\"  \"It is a little different with me, sir,\" said Frank. I'm an American.\"  \"All the same,\" said Lord Hastings, \"you're a British naval officer, no matter what your nativity.\"  \"That's true, too, sir,\" Frank agreed. \"I haven't thought of it in just that way.\"  \"Well,\" said Lord Hastings, \"I shall report then that Captain Templeton and First Lieutenant Chadwick will go aboard the Plymouth this evening.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said Jack.  This is the reason then that Jack and Frank found themselves aboard an American destroyer in the Irish sea.  Frank Chadwick, as we have seen, was an American. He had been in Italy with his father when the great war began. He had been shanghaied in Naples soon after Germany's declaration of war on France. When he came to his senses he found that his captors were a band of mutinous sailors. Aboard the vessel he found a second prisoner, who turned out to be a member of the British secret service.  Frank met Jack Templeton, a British youth, aboard the schooner. Jack came aboard in a peculiar way.  The schooner, in control of the mutineers, had put into a north African port for provisions. Now it chanced that the store where the mutineers sought to buy provisions was conducted by Jack. The lad was absent when the supplies were purchased and returned a few moments later to find that the mutineers had departed without making payment.  Jack's anger bubbled over. He put off for the schooner in a small boat. Aboard, the chief of the mutineers refused the demand for payment. A fight ensued. Jack, facing heavy odds, sought refuge in the hold of the vessel, where he was made a prisoner.  During the night Jack was able to force his way from the hold into the cabin where Frank and the British secret service agent were held captives. He released them, and joining forces, the three were able to overcome the mutineers and make themselves masters of the ship.  Now Jack Templeton was an experienced seaman and knew more than the rudiments of navigation. Under his direction the schooner returned to the little African port that he called home. There the three erstwhile prisoners left the ship to the mutineers.  Later, through the good offices of the British secret service, Frank and Jack made the acquaintance of Lord Hastings, also in the diplomatic service. They were able to render some service to the latter and later accompanied him to his home in London. There, at their request, Lord Hastings, who in the meantime had been given command of a ship of war, had them attached to his ship with the rank of midshipmen.  Both Jack and Frank had risen swiftly in the British service. They had seen active service in all quarters of the globe and had fought under many flags.  Under Lord Hastings' command they had been with the British fleet in the North Sea when it struck the first decisive blow against the Germans just off Helgoland. Later they were found under the Tricolor of France and with the Italians in the Adriatic. With the British fleet again when it sallied forth to clear the seven seas of enemy vessels, they had traversed the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Indian oceans. It had been their fortune, too, to see considerable land fighting. They had been with the Anglo-Japanese forces in the east and had conducted raiding parties in some of the German colonial possessions.  Several times they had successfully run the blockade in the Kiel canal, passing through the narrow straits in submarines just out of reach of the foe. In Russia, they had, early in the war, lent invaluable assistance to the Czar; and more lately, they had been in the eastern monarchy when Czar Nicholas had been forced to renounce his throne.  Once since the war began they had been to America. This was shortly after the United States entered the war. They were ordered to the North Atlantic in order to help the American authorities snare a German commerce raider which, in some unaccountable manner, had run the British blockade in the North sea, and was wreaking havoc with allied shipping. Later they went to New York, and then returned to Europe with a combined British-American convoy for the first expeditionary force to cross the seas.  In temperament and disposition Jack and Frank were as unlike as one could conceive. Jack, big for his age, broad-shouldered and strong, was always cool and collected. Frank, on the other hand, was of a more fiery nature, easily angered and often rash and reckless. Jack's steadying influence had often kept the two out of trouble, or brought them through safely when they were in difficulties.  Both lads spoke French and German fluently and each had a smattering of Italian. Also, as the result of several trips to Russia, they had a few words of the Russian tongue at their command.  In physical strength, Jack excelled Frank by far, although the latter was by no means a weakling. On the other hand again, Frank was a crack shot with either rifle or revolver; in fact, he was such an excellent marksman as to cause his chum no little degree of envy. Then, too, both lads were proficient in the art of self defense and both had learned to hold their own with the sword.  Up to the time this story opens the combined allied fleets had succeeded in keeping the Germans bottled up in the strong fortress of Helgoland. True, the enemy several times had sallied forth in few numbers, apparently seeking to run the blockade in an effort to prey upon allied merchant ships. But every time they had offered battle they had received the worst of it. They had been staggered with a terrible defeat at Jutland almost a year before this story opens, and since that time had not ventured forth.  But even now,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14626"],["title","The Boy Allies with the Victorious Fleets; Or, The Fall of the German Navy (#2)"],["body","the security of their hiding places, the Germans were meditating a bold stroke. Submarines were being coaled and victualed in preparation for a dash across the Atlantic. Already, one enemy submarine--a merchantman--had passed the allied ships blocking the English channel and had crossed to America and returned. Some months later, a U-Boat of the war type had followed suit. A cordon of ally ships had been thrown around American ports to snare this venturesome submarine on its return, but it had eluded them and returned safely to its home port.  But soon--very soon, indeed--German undersea craft were to strike a more severe blow at allied shipping, carrying, for the moment, the war in all its horrors to the very door of America. While the United States was arming and equipping its millions to send across the sea to destroy the kaiser and German militarism, these enemy undersea craft were crossing the Atlantic determined to reap a rich harvest upon American, allied and neutral shipping off the American coast.  And the blow was to be delivered without warning--almost.  When the U.S.S. Plymouth, under Jack's command, returned to Liverpool, the captain of the vessel, having somewhat recovered, came aboard and relieved Jack of command.  \"I'm obliged for your services, Captain,\" he said, \"but I'll take charge of the old scow again myself, with your leave.\"  Jack and Frank went ashore, where, at their hotel, they received a brief telegram from Lord Hastings. It read as follows:      \"Return to Dover at once. Important.\"  \"Now I wonder what is up,\" said Frank after reading the message.  \"The simplest way to find out,\" replied Jack, \"is to go and see.\"     CHAPTER III  OFF FOR AMERICA   \"Then everything went first rate your first trip, Captain?\" questioned Lord Hastings.  \"First rate, sir,\" Jack replied.  The lads were back in Dover where, the first thing after their arrival, they sought an audience with their former commander.  \"Yes, sir,\" Frank agreed, \"Jack makes an A-1 captain.\"  \"I'm glad to hear it,\" was Lord Hastings' comment. \"I've other work in hand and I wouldn't want to trust it to a man who is nervous under fire.\"  \"But we were not under fire this time, sir,\" said Jack.  \"You mustn't always take me literally, Jack,\" smiled Lord Hastings. \"It was your first venture in your present rank and you acquitted yourself creditably. That is what I meant.\"  \"And what is the other venture, sir?\" Frank asked eagerly.  \"There you go again, Frank,\" said Lord Hastings. \"How many times have I told you that you must restrain your impatience.\"  Frank was abashed.  \"Your warnings don't seem to do much good, I'll admit, sir. Nevertheless, I'll try to do better.\"  \"See that you do,\" returned Lord Hastings gravely. \"Nothing was ever gained by too great impatience. Remember that.\"  \"I'll try, sir.\"  \"Very well. Then I shall acquaint you with the nature of the work in hand.\"  The boys listened intently to Lord Hastings' next words.  \"As you know,\" His Lordship began, \"the seas have virtually been cleared of all enemy ships. All German merchant vessels have been captured or sunk. What few raiders that preyed on our commerce for a time have been put out of business.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Jack. \"Our merchant vessels no longer have anything to fear from the foe.\"  \"They shouldn't, that's true enough,\" replied Lord Hastings.  \"You mean they have, sir?\" asked Jack, incredulously.  Lord Hastings nodded.  \"I do,\" he admitted gravely. \"Particularly shipping on the other side of the Atlantic.\"  \"America, sir?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"But surely,\" Frank put in, \"surely our blockade is tight enough to prevent the enemy from breaking through.\"  \"We have not yet found means,\" replied Lord Hastings, \"of effectually blockading the submarine.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" said Frank. \"You mean that the Germans plan to open a submarine campaign upon allied shipping in American waters.\"  \"Such is my information,\" declared Lord Hastings.  \"And,\" said Jack, \"you wish us to cross the Atlantic and take a hand in the game of taming the U-Boats, sir.\"  \"Such is my idea,\" Lord Hastings admitted. \"Let me explain. My information is not authentic, but nevertheless, knowing the Germans as I do, I am tempted to credit it.\"  \"Then why not warn the United States, sir?\" asked Frank. \"There are enough American ships of war off the coast to deal effectually with all the submarines the Germans can get across.\"  \"So I would,\" was Lord Hastings' reply, \"but for the fact that some officials of the admiralty are opposed to it.\"  \"Opposed?\" exclaimed Jack. \"And why, sir?\"  \"Because they labor under the delusion that such a warning would throw the people of the United States into a panic and would prevent the sending of additional troops to France.\"  \"What a fool idea! By George!\" exclaimed Frank, \"what do they think the American people are made of?\"  \"You'll have to ask them,\" was Lord Hastings' answer to this question. \"For my own part, I feel that it is hardly fair to keep this information from the American authorities.\"  \"I should say it isn't fair,\" declared Frank.  \"I agree with you,\" said Jack. \"But just where do Frank and I come in, sir?\"  \"I'll make that plain to you very quickly,\" replied Lord Hastings.  He drew a paper from his pocket and passed it to Jack.  \"Here,\" he said, \"is your commission as captain of H.M.S. Brigadier.\" He passed a second paper to Frank. \"This,\" he continued, \"is your commission as first officer of the same vessel. Now, through channels known only to myself, I have induced the admiralty to send you to America with certain papers for Secretary Daniels of the navy department. At the same time, I have other personal papers which I shall have you deliver to the secretary of the navy for me. These will acquaint him with the facts I have just laid before you.\"  \"I see, sir,\" said Jack. \"But, if you will pardon my asking, what will happen to you sir should it be found out you have acted contrary to the wishes of the admiralty majority?\"  Lord Hastings shrugged his shoulders disdainfully.  \"What's the difference?\" he wanted to know. \"Our allies must be warned.\"  \"I agree with you, sir,\" declared Jack.  \"And I, sir,\" said Frank.  \"It is possible,\" said Lord Hastings, \"that should I take the matter up with the King or with the war ministry I might get action; but that would take time, and I want this message delivered at the earliest possible moment. Should I entrust it to the cables, under the circumstances, there is nothing certain of its arrival.\"  \"I see, sir,\" said Jack. \"Then you may be sure that I shall deliver the message personally to Secretary Daniels.\"  \"It is well,\" said Lord Hastings. \"I knew I could depend upon you boys.\"  \"Always, sir,\" replied Jack simply.  \"Then be off with you,\" said Lord Hastings, rising. \"You can go aboard your ship to-night. Here is the message I wish delivered to the American secretary of the navy,\" and he passed a second paper to Jack. \"The admiralty message you are to take will probably reach you some time in the morning, together with your sailing orders.\"  Lord Hastings extended his hand.  \"Good-bye and good luck,\" he said.  Jack and Frank shook hands with him and took their departure.  \"I'll be glad to get back to America if only for a short time,\" said Frank, as they walked toward the water front.  \"I won't mind another look at the United States myself,\" Jack declared. \"It looks like a pretty good country to me, from what I saw of it last trip. Almost as good as England, I guess.\"  \"Almost?\" repeated Frank. \"Say, let me tell you something. The United States is the greatest country under the sun and don't you forget it. You Johnny Bulls seem to think that England is the only spot on the map.\"  \"Well,\" returned Jack with a smile, \"it strikes me that you boast considerably about your own land.\"  Frank's face reddened a trifle.  \"Maybe I do,\" he admitted, \"but it's worth it.\"  \"So is England,\" said Jack quietly.  \"By George! So it is, Jack,\" said Frank. \"Maybe it is a fact that I talk too much sometimes.\"  \"No 'maybes' about it,\" declared Jack. \"It's just a plain fact.\"  \"Look here,\" said Frank, somewhat nettled, \"you may be my boss aboard ship, but right now, with no witnesses present to hear what I say, I'll say what I like.\"  \"Come, come, now,\" said Jack with a smile, \"don't get all out of humor just because I joke you a little bit.\"  Frank grinned.  \"Well, then don't always thinks I'm angry just because I make a hot reply,\" he said.  Jack let it go at that.  \"Well, here we are at the water front,\" he said a few moments later, \"and if I'm not mistaken that's the Brigadier about a hundred yards off shore there.\"  \"That's the Brigadier, all right,\" said Frank, \"I can see her name forward even at this distance. By George! but the camouflage artists have certainly done a good job on her.\"  \"So they have,\" Jack agreed. \"But we may as well go aboard.\"  They commandeered a small boat and rowed rapidly to the Brigadier. Jack swung himself up on deck and Frank climbed up behind him.  A young lieutenant greeted Jack respectfully after a quick glance at the latter's bars.  \"What can I do for you, sir?\" he asked.  \"You may go below and tell the engineer to get steam up immediately,\" replied Jack. \"We may not sail before morning, but I may desire to leave before.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" replied the young officer, \"but may I ask who you are, sir?\"  \"Certainly,\" replied Jack, \"I'm the commander of this ship, Captain Templeton. This is Mr. Chadwick, my first officer. What is your name, sir?\"  \"Hetherton, sir, second officer of the Brigadier.\"  \"Very good, Lieutenant. You shall stay on here as second officer until further notice. Now below with you.\"  Lieutenant Hetherton disappeared.  \"I guess he won't ask many more questions,\" said Frank grimly.  \"Perhaps not,\" said Jack. \"Now, Mr. Chadwick, will you be so kind as to take the deck while I go to my cabin.\"  Frank seemed about to remark upon Jack's sudden change in manner. Then he thought better of it"]]]
