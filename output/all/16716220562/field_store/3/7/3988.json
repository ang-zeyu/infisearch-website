There, now, I'm speaking fair by you, and you may as well behave yourselves.\"  \"Speaking fair by us!\" exclaimed Marjorie, who was as yet more indignant than frightened. \"Do you call it speaking fair by us to tell us that we must stay here when we want to go on! You are bad, wicked men!\"  \"Yes, little Miss,\" was the answer, with a shout of laughter, \"we _are_ bad, wicked men! Now what are you going to do about it? You don't fancy for a minute that you can get away, do you?\"  This silenced Marjorie, for there was no answer to such a question. Her rage had spent itself in her impetuous speech, and she knew of course that two children could not get away from this band of villains if they were not allowed to do so. But she did not cry. Her feelings were too wrought up for that. She sat where they had placed her, and tried bravely to conceal the fright and fear that were every moment growing stronger within her. She gave one imploring glance at King, and he came over and sat beside her. He took her hand in a tight clasp, implying that whatever happened they would face it together.  \"Keep 'em there for the present,\" growled the man who seemed to be the spokesman, and then he and the other man went away, leaving the children in care of the three gypsy women.  Although apparently the women paid little attention to their young prisoners, King and Midget could easily see that the eyes of their jailers were ever alert, and watching their slightest movement. Had they tried to cut and run, they would have been caught before they reached the door. But no heed was paid when they whispered together, and so they were able to hold a long conversation which was unheard, and even unnoticed by the others.  \"You know, Mops, what has happened?\" whispered King.  \"No, I don't; what do they want of us?\"  \"Why, we're kidnapped and held for ransom. Those men have probably gone out now to send letters to Father about the ransom money.\"  \"Oh, then Father'll pay it, and we'll get away.\"  \"It isn't so easy as that. They have lots of fussing back and forth. We may be here a long time. I say, Mops, you're a brick not to cry.\"  \"I'm too mad to cry. The idea of their keeping us here like this! It's outrageous! Why, King, by this time we would have been in Pelton. Just think how worried Father and Mother must be!\"  \"Don't think about that, Mops, or you will cry sure. And I will, too! Let's think how to get away.\"  But thinking was of little use, as there was no way to get away but to run out at the door, and an attempt at that would be such certain failure that it was not worth trying.  So the children sat there in dumb misery, silently watching the gypsy women as they moved about preparing the mid-day meal.  Occasionally they spoke, and their manner and words were kindly, but King and Midget could not bring themselves to respond in the same way.  \"King,\" whispered Marjorie, \"how far do you suppose we are from the road?\"  \"Too far to run there, if that's what you mean. We'd be caught before we started,\" was the whispered reply.  \"That isn't what I mean; but how far are we?\"  \"Not very far, Midget; after we crossed the little bridge, the path to this place was sort of parallel to the road.\"  \"Well, King, I've got an idea. Don't say anything, and don't stop me.\"  With a stretch and a yawn as of great weariness, Marjorie slowly rose. Immediately the three women started toward her. \"You sit still!\" said one, sharply.  \"Mayn't I walk about the room, if I promise not to go out the door?\" said Marjorie; \"I'm so cramped sitting still.\"  \"Move around if you want to,\" said the youngest of the women, a little more gently; \"but there's no use your trying to run away,\" and she wagged her head ominously.  \"Honest, I won't try to run away,\" and Marjorie's big, dark eyes looked gravely at her captor.  The women said nothing more, and Marjorie wandered about the tent in an apparently aimless manner. But after a time she came near to a small slit in the side of the tent that served as a sort of window, and here she paused and examined some beads that hung near by. Then choosing a moment when the women were most attentive to their household duties, she put her head out through the window and _yelled_. Now Marjorie Maynard's yell was something that a Comanche Indian might be proud of. Blessed with strong, healthy lungs, and being by nature fond of shouting, she possessed an ability to scream which was really unusual.  As her blood-curdling shouts rent the air, the three women were so stupefied that for a moment they could say or do nothing. This gave Marjorie additional time, and she made the most of it. Her entire lung power spent itself in successive shrieks more than a dozen times, before she was finally dragged away from the window by the infuriated gypsy women.  Marjorie turned upon them, unafraid.  \"I told you I wouldn't try to run away,\" she said, \"and neither I didn't. But I had a right to yell, and if anybody heard me, I hope he'll come right straight here! You are bad, wicked women!\"  The child's righteous indignation had its effect on the women, and they hesitated, not knowing exactly what to do with this little termagant.  And strange to say, Marjorie's ruse had succeeded.  For when the Maynards reached Pelton, and had found the inn where they were to lunch, Pompton, the chauffeur, had expressed himself as unwilling to sit there quietly and await the arrival of King and Marjorie.  \"The poor children will be done out,\" he said to Mr. Maynard, \"and by your leave, sir, I'll just take the car, and run back a few rods and pick them up.\"  \"That's good of you, Pompton,\" said Mr. Maynard, appreciatively. \"They can't be far away now, but they'll be glad of a lift.\"  So Pompton turned the car about, and started back along the road he had just come. To his surprise, he did not meet the children as soon as he had expected, and as he continued his route without seeing them, he began to be really alarmed. He passed the halfway sign, and went nearly to the place where he had left them and had taken in the lame girl.  \"There's something happened to them,\" he said to himself. \"My word! I knew those children ought not to be left to themselves! They're too full of mischief. Like as not they've trailed off into the woods, and how can I ever find them?\"  Wondering what he had better do, Pompton turned the car around, and slowly went back toward Pelton. At every crossroad or side path into the woods he paused and shouted, but heard no response. When at last he came near the place where the children had really turned off toward the brook, he stopped and looked about. Seeing smoke issuing from among the trees at a little distance, he thought, \"That's a gypsy camp. Now wouldn't it be just like those youngsters to trail in there? Anyway it's the most likely place, and I'm going to have a look.\"  Leaving his car by the side of the road, Pompton struck into the field, and soon came to the little bridge just beyond which the old basket-weaver still sat.  \"Have you seen anything of two children?\" Pompton inquired, civilly.  \"No,\" growled the man, looking up and frowning a little.  \"Well, I'm fairly sure they came in here from the road about half an hour ago. Perhaps you didn't notice them. I'll just take a look round.\" He started in the direction of the camp, but the man called him back.  \"I tell you no children have been near here,\" he said, in a voice slightly less surly. \"If they had, they'd have had to cross this bridge, and I couldn't miss seeing them. I've been here two hours.\"  This seemed conclusive, and Pompton had no reason to think the man was not telling the truth. But he was without doubt a gypsy, and Pompton had small respect for the veracity of the gypsy. He waited a few moments, pretending to be interested in the man's basketry, but really considering whether to insist on going on to the camp hidden in the trees, or whether to believe the man's statement.  And it was at this moment that Marjorie's shrieks rang out.  \"Good heavens!\" cried Pompton. \"What is that?\"  The basket-weaver neither heard nor answered him, for the shrieks continued, and Pompton set off at a run in the direction whence they came. He was not quite sure it was Marjorie's voice, but there was certainly somebody in distress, and Pompton was of a valiant nature.  The smoke issuing above the trees was sufficient guide, and his flying steps soon brought him to the encampment. Flinging open, indeed almost tearing down the flapping door of the tent, he strode inside.  \"What's the matter here?\" he began, but he could get no further, for with a glad cry the two Maynard children flung themselves into his out-stretched arms.     CHAPTER VI  AT GRANDMA SHERWOOD'S   Aside from his threatening face, red with rage, and stormy with indignation, Pompton's terrifying aspect was increased by the chauffeur's costume which he wore. His goggles were pushed up on his brow, but his eyes darted vengeance, and the three gypsy women were completely cowed at the sight of him.  \"You shall pay for this outrage!\" he exclaimed; \"and don't think you will be let down easy! Kidnapping is a crime that is well punished, and your punishment shall be to the full! I shall take these children away now, but don't think you can escape! I will see to that! Where are your men folks?\"  Pompton was a large man, more than six feet high, and heavy in proportion, and as he towered above the frightened gypsy women, they could find no words to answer him.  \"I'll find them for myself!\" he exclaimed, and taking the children by either hand, he hurried them out of the tent.  As Pompton had surmised, the men had run away to the woods, and hidden themselves, for no trace of them could be seen. The old basket-maker, too, had disappeared, and there was nothing to prevent their departure.  \"Miss Marjorie, you're a wonder!\" Pompton exclaimed, as they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15072"],["title","Marjorie's Maytime (#7)"],["body","the little bridge and made for the road. \"Now, how did you think to shout the very lungs out of you like that?\"  \"It was the only thing to do, Pompton; they wouldn't let us run away, so there was nothing to do but holler. My! but I'm glad you came!\"  \"Me, too!\" cried King. \"I felt awful to sit there and not do anything to rescue Mops, but I couldn't think of a thing to do. I never thought of yelling to beat the band!\"  \"Of course you didn't, King,\" said Marjorie. \"A boy wouldn't do that. And, anyway, you can't screech like I can.\"  \"I didn't suppose anybody could, Miss Marjorie; I'm sure such screams were never heard before, outside of Bedlam!\"  \"Well, we're safe now, anyway,\" cried Marjorie, skipping along gaily by Pompton's side; \"and here's our dear, blessed car! Oh, King, I'm so glad we're safe!\"  In a reaction of joy, Marjorie threw her arms around her brother's neck, and the tears came to her eyes.  \"There, there, Mops,\" and King patted her shoulders, while there was a suggestion of emotion in his own voice; \"it's all right now! Hop in, old girl!\"  \"Yes, hop in, both of you,\" said Pompton, \"and I'll get you back to Pelton pretty quick, and then I'll set somebody on the track of those villains. They'll not get away!\"  The trip to Pelton took but a short time, for Pompton drove as fast as the law allowed. But even so, they found a very much alarmed group waiting for them on the veranda of the little inn.  \"Where have you been?\" exclaimed Mrs. Maynard, as Marjorie flung her arms around her mother's neck, and burst into violent sobs. The realization that she was safe brought a nervous reaction, and though she had been plucky and brave in the hour of danger, she now collapsed with emotion.  \"I'll tell you all about it,\" said King, grasping his father's hands. \"Midget was the bravest, pluckiest girl, and she saved both our lives.\"  \"What!\" cried Mr. Maynard, \"have you been in danger?\"  Marjorie stopped her sobs a moment, and lifted her head from her mother's shoulder.  \"It was P-Pompton saved us! I didn't do any saving,--I only s-screeched!\"  \"And you screeched good and plenty, Miss Marjorie,\" said the chauffeur, \"which was what saved the day; and, Mr. Maynard, by your leave, I'll take the car a minute, to see if there's anybody in authority in this village. I've a matter to put in their hands.\"  Without waiting for further explanation, Pompton whizzed away in the big car to find the public officials, and set them on trail of the gypsies. For though unsuccessful, their base attempt at kidnapping ought not to go unpunished.  Kingdon told a straightforward story of all that had happened. Unlike Marjorie, he was not overcome by emotion, and though somewhat excited after the experience they had had, he gave a clear and direct account of it all.  Mrs. Maynard held Marjorie closer as she heard of the danger they had been in, and Mr. Maynard laid his hand on the shoulder of his tall son, and heartily exonerated him from all blame in the matter.  \"I suppose,\" King said, a little dubiously, \"we ought not to have gone on to the camp; but Mops,--I mean, we were both thirsty,--and we thought it was a farmhouse.\"  \"Of course you did,\" said Mrs. Maynard; \"you did nothing wrong whatever.\"  \"I did,\" said Midget, penitently; \"after we passed the horrid basket-man, King sort of thought he was a gypsy, and he thought we'd better turn back, but I insisted on going on.\"  \"Nothing of the sort!\" exclaimed King. \"Mops isn't a bit to blame! I did think maybe the man was a gypsy,--and I ought to have insisted on going back.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"don't strive so hard for the honor of being to blame. It's all over now, and for the present let's forget it, while we eat our luncheon, because it might interfere with our digestion. We're truly thankful to have you back, and we're going to show our thankfulness by not worrying or lamenting over what might have been.\"  Mr. Maynard's gaiety, though it was really a little forced, had a good effect on the others. For, had he taken a melancholy attitude, they were quite ready to follow suit.  As it was, they all cheered up, and with bright faces followed Mr. Maynard to the dining-room. Kitty slipped her hand in Marjorie's as they went along. She had said little while the story was being told, but as Marjorie well knew, silence with Kitty was always indicative of deep emotion.  The inn, though modern, was copied after a quaint old plan, and the low-ceiled, raftered dining-room greatly pleased the children. There were seats along the wall--something like church pews,--with long tables in front of them. Mr. Maynard had ordered a dainty and satisfying luncheon, and Marjorie and King soon found that thrilling experiences improve the appetite.  Led by Mr. Maynard, the table talk was gay, light, and entertaining; and though Mrs. Maynard could not quite play up to this key, yet she did her best, and carefully hid the tremors that shook her as she looked at her two older children.  \"What became of Minnie Meyer?\" asked Marjorie, suddenly, for in the stress of circumstances she had almost forgotten the lame girl.  \"I tried my best to persuade her to lunch with us,\" said Mrs. Maynard, \"but she would not do so. She was very shy and timid, and though very glad to have the ride, she was unwilling to let us do more for her. She had many errands to attend to, and she was sure of a ride home, so she said we need not worry about her.\"  \"I'm glad she had the ride,\" said Marjorie, thoughtfully; \"and of course it wasn't her fault that the morning turned out as it did.\"  \"No, it wasn't,\" said King, \"and it wasn't our fault either! It wasn't anybody's fault; it just happened.\"  \"And now it happens that it's all over,\" said his father, still insistently cheerful, \"and the incident is closed, and it's past history, and we've all forgotten it. Have some more chicken, King?\"  \"Yes,\" said King, \"these forgotten experiences make a fellow terribly hungry!\"  The subject of the morning's disaster was not again referred to, and Mr. Maynard triumphantly succeeded in his determination to eliminate all thought of it.  By two o'clock Pompton was at the door with the car, and they started gaily off to continue their journey.  Mr. Maynard sat in front with the chauffeur, and if they indulged in some whispered conversation it was not audible to those in the tonneau.  Midget and King themselves had quite recovered their good spirits, and were ready to enjoy the ride through the country.  They went rather fast, as they had started a bit later than they intended, but not too fast to enjoy the scenery or the interesting scenes on either side.  On they went, through towns and villages, past woods and meadows, and up and down moderately high hills. As they neared Morristown, where Grandma Sherwood lived, the hills were higher and the views more picturesque.  It was not yet dusk when they reached Grandma Sherwood's house, and they found the wide gate hospitably open for them. They swung into the driveway, and in another moment they saw Grandma and Uncle Steve on the veranda, waiting to welcome them.  The impetuous Maynard children tumbled out of the car all at once, and fairly swarmed upon their relatives.  \"Which is which?\" cried Uncle Steve. \"Kitty has grown as big as Marjorie was,--and Marjorie has grown as big as King was,--and King has grown as big as,--as a house!\"  \"And me growed!\" cried Rosamond, not wanting to be left out of the comparison.  \"You're the biggest of all!\" exclaimed Uncle Steve, catching the baby up and seating her on his shoulder, so she could look down on all the others.  \"Yes, me biggest of all,\" she declared, contentedly, as she wound her fat arms around Uncle Steve's neck; \"now me go see schickens!\"  \"Not just now, Rosy Posy,\" said her mother, \"let's all go in the house and see what we can find there.\"  Easily diverted, the baby went contentedly with her mother, but the mention of chickens had roused in the other children a desire to see the farmyard pets, and King said: \"Come on, Mops and Kit, let's us go and see the chickens; come on, Uncle Steve.\"  \"Eliza first!\" cried Marjorie, remembering the old cook's friendliness toward them all; \"come on!\"  Following Midget's lead, the trio went tearing through the house to the kitchen.  Uncle Steve paused in the library where the others were, and said to his sister, \"They're the same Maynard children, Helen, if they are a year older. We enjoyed Marjorie last summer, and I know we'll enjoy Kitty this year,--but how you can live with them all at once I can't understand!\"  \"It's habit,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling, \"you know, Steve, you can get used to 'most anything.\"  \"It seems to agree with you, Helen, at any rate,\" said Grandma Sherwood, looking at her daughter's pink cheeks and bright eyes.  Meanwhile, the younger Maynards had reached the kitchen, and were dancing round Eliza, with shouts of glee.  \"Are you glad to see me again, Eliza?\" asked Marjorie, flinging herself into the arms of the stout Irishwoman.  \"Glad is it, Miss Midget? Faith, I'm thot glad I kin hardly see ye fer gladness! Ye've grow'd,--but I do say not so much as I expicted! But Masther King, now he's as high as the church shpire! And as fer Miss Kitty,--arrah, but she's the dumplin' darlin'! Stan' out there now, Miss Kitty, an' let me look at yez! Och! but yer the foine gurrul! An' it's ye thot's comin' to spend the summer. My! but the toimes we'll be havin'!\"  It was a custom of the Maynards for one of the children to spend each summer at Grandma Sherwood's, and as Marjorie had been there last year, it was now Kitty's turn.  \"Yes, I'm coming, Eliza,\" she said, in her sedate way, \"but I'm not going to stay now, you know; we're all going on a tour. But I'll come back here the first of June, and stay a long time.\"  \"Any cookies, Eliza?\" asked King, apropos of nothing.  \"Cookies, is it? There do be, indade! But if yez be afther eatin' thim now, ye'll shpoil yer supper,--thot ye will! Here's "]]]
