I have grown so sick of your silly, brainless fops, who expect women neither to talk sense nor understand it.\"  \"Ah, I dare say! and Mr. Travilla is the most sensible and polished of men--always excepting my own spouse, of course. And you won't be taken away from us; so I give my consent.\"  Elsie's only answer was a mirthful, amused look.  \"Oh, but I am glad to see you back!\" Carrie ran on. \"It seems an age since you went away.\"  \"Thank you. And your husband? what is he like?\"  \"I was never good at description, but he is a fine specimen of a Kentucky planter, and very fond of his wife. By the way, you must blame me that Edward and Lora were so late in welcoming you home. I arrived only yesterday morning, quite fatigued with my journey, and begged them to wait till to-day, and bring me with them.\"  \"That was right. We have not seen Enna yet, or Arthur. Grandpa and Mrs. Dinsmore and Walter called yesterday. But there is the dinner-bell. Let me conduct you to the dining-room.\"  They were just in time to sit down with the others.  Elsie quickly perceived by her Aunt Lora's look and manner, that she, too, had heard the news, but no remark was make on the subject till the ladies had retired to the drawing-room, leaving the gentlemen to the enjoyment of their after-dinner cigars.  Then Mrs. Howard, facing round upon her niece as they entered the room, exclaimed, \"Elsie, you naughty child! are you not ashamed of yourself?\"  \"On account of what, auntie?\"  \"Such unconscious innocence!\" cried Lora, throwing up the white and jeweled hands she had rested lightly for an instant upon the young girl's shoulder, while gazing steadily into the smiling, blushing, sparkling face. \"You haven't been planning and promising to give Adelaide and me a nephew older than ourselves? I tell you, miss, I refuse my consent. Why, it's absurd! the very idea! I used to think him almost an elderly gentleman when you were a chit of eight or nine.\"  \"I remember having had some such idea myself; but he must have been growing young since then,\" returned Elsie, demurely.  \"He seems to have been standing still (waiting for you, I suppose); but I never was more astonished in my life!\" said Lora, dropping into a chair.  \"It has been a genuine surprise to us all,\" remarked Rose.  \"To me as much as anyone, mamma,\" said Elsie. \"I--had thought he was engaged to you, Aunt Adie.\"  \"To _me_, child!\"  \"Why, my dear, I surely told you about her engagement to my brother Edward?\" exclaimed Adelaide and Rose simultaneously.  \"You tried, mamma, and it was all my own fault that I did not hear the whole truth. And, Aunt Adie, I cannot understand how he could ever fancy me, while he might have hoped there was a possibility of winning you.\"  \"'Twould have been a much more suitable match,\" said Lora. \"Though I'd have preferred the one in contemplation, except that in the other case, she would not be carried quite away from us. But suppose we proceed to business. We should have a double wedding, I think.\"  \"Oh, don't talk of it yet,\" said Rose, with a slight tremble in her voice, and looking at Elsie's flushed, conscious face with eyes full of unshed tears. \"Adelaide's is to be within the next two months, and--we cannot give up Elsie so suddenly.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Adelaide; \"and I should have serious objections to being used as a foil to Elsie's youth and beauty.\"  The Howards and Mr. Travilla stayed to tea, and shortly before that meal the party was increased by the arrival of Walter Dinsmore and Mrs. Dick Percival.  Enna had lost flesh and color; and long indulgence of a fretful, peevish temper had drawn down the corners of her mouth, lined her forehead, and left its ugly pencilings here and there over the once pretty face, so that it already began to look old and care-worn. She was very gayly dressed, in the height of the fashion, and rather overloaded with jewelry; but powder and rouge could not altogether conceal the ravages of discontent and passion. She was conscious of the fact, and inwardly dwelt with mortification and chagrin upon the contrast presented by her own faded face to that of Elsie, so fair and blooming, so almost childish in its sweet purity and innocence of expression.  \"So you are single yet,\" Enna said, with a covert sneer; \"and not likely to marry either, so far as I've been able to learn. They'll soon begin to call you an old maid.\"  \"Will they?\" said Mr. Dinsmore, with a laugh in which all present joined, Enna herself excepted; \"well, if she is a fair specimen of that much-abused class, they are far more attractive than is generally supposed.\"  \"You needn't laugh,\" said Enna; \"I was four years younger than she is now, when I married. I wasn't going to wait till they began to call me an old maid.\"  \"To bear that reproach is not the worst calamity that can befall a woman,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore gravely; then changed the subject by a kind inquiry in regard to Arthur.  \"Slowly and steadily improving,\" answered Walter. \"The doctors are now satisfied that he is not permanently crippled, though he still uses a crutch.\"     CHAPTER SECOND.      \"Mutual love, the crown of all our bliss.\"                      --MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.   After a half hour of waiting for her son's return, Mrs. Travilla sat down to her lonely cup of tea. There was no lack of delicacies on the table, and in all Edward's taste had been consulted. To make him comfortable and happy was, next to serving her God, the great aim and object of his mother's life; and, in a less degree, of that of every servant in the house. They had all been born and brought up at Ion, and had all these years known him as the kindest, most reasonable and considerate of masters.  \"Wish Massa Edard come. Dese waffles jes' prime to-night, an' he so fond ob dem,\" remarked a pretty mulatto girl, handing a plate of them to her mistress.  \"Yes, Prilla, he expected to be at home, but is probably taking tea at the Oaks or Roselands.\" And the old lady supped her tea and ate her waffles with a serene, happy face, now and then lighted up by a pleased smile which her attendant handmaiden was at a loss to interpret.  Having finished her meal, Mrs. Travilla threw a shawl about her shoulders and stepped out upon the veranda; then, tempted by the beauty of the night, walked down the avenue to meet her son or see if there were any signs of his approach.  She had not gone half the distance ere the sound of horses' hoofs reached her ear--distant at first but coming rapidly nearer, till a lady and gentleman drew rein at the gate, while the servant who had been riding in the rear dismounted and threw it open.  They came dashing up, but paused and drew rein again at sight of the old lady standing there under the trees.  \"Mother,\" cried her son, springing from the saddle, \"you were not alarmed? anxious? surely.\"  \"No, no, Edward, but glad to see you and Elsie! my dear child, this is very kind.\"  \"Not at all, dear Mrs. Travilla; it is so lovely an evening for a ride; or walk either,\" she added, giving her hand to her escort and springing lightly to the ground.  Mr. Travilla put the hand into that of his mother. \"Take her to your heart, mother; she is mine--ours!\" he said, in low tones tremulous with joy.  The old lady folded the slight girlish form to her breast for a moment, with a silence more eloquent than words.  \"Thank God! thank God!\" she murmured at length. \"He has given me my heart's desire;\" and mingled caresses and tears fell upon Elsie's face. \"For many years I have loved you as my own child, and now I am to have you. How bright our home will be, Edward. But we are darkening another. Her father; can he--has he----\"  \"He has given her to me,\" answered the son quickly, \"and she has--we have given ourselves to each other. Let me give an arm to each of you and we will go into the house.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The veranda at the Oaks was deserted, and the house very quiet, though lights still shone here and there, as Mr. Travilla and Elsie rode up and dismounted on their return from Ion.  A servant rose from the grass, where he had been lying at his ease; came forward and led away his young mistress's pony, while the lover bade her a tender good-night, sprang into the saddle again, and presently disappeared, lost to view amid the trees and the windings of the road, though the sound of horse's hoofs still came faintly to Elsie's ear as she stood intently listening, a sweet smile irradiating every feature.  Absorbed in her own thoughts, and in the effort to catch those fast-retreating sounds, she did not hear a step approaching from behind; but an arm encircled her waist, and a low-breathed \"My darling\" woke her from her reverie.  She looked up, her eyes beaming with affection; \"Papa; I am rather late, am I not?\"  \"Not very. Hark! the clock is but just striking ten. Come, let us sit down here for a little. We have hardly had a chat together to-day.\" He sighed slightly as he drew her closer to him.  \"No, papa dear, there has been so much company,\" she answered, laying her head on his shoulder. \"And----\"  \"And what?\" as she paused. \"Your father used to know all that concerned you one way or the other. Is he to be shut out from your confidence now? Ah, I think he must have been for some time past.\"  \"I could not tell you _that_, papa,\" she murmured, blushing visibly in the moonlight. \"Indeed, I hardly knew it myself till----\"  \"Till when?\"  \"The night of Sophie's wedding.\"  \"Ah!\" he said, musingly; \"but I cannot get over my surprise; he is your senior by so many years, and you have known him from childhood and looked upon him as a sort of uncle. I wonder at your choice.\"  \"But you don't object, papa?\"  \"No, if I must give you away--and I've always known that would come some time--I would rather it should be to him than any one else, for I can never doubt that he will be tender and true to my precious one, when she leaves her father's home for his.\"  \"Papa, papa,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],["title","Elsie's Womanhood (#2)"],["body","'t speak of it,\" she cried, winding her arms about his neck, \"I can't bear to think of it; that our home will no longer be the same, that I can't come to you every night and be folded to your heart as I have been ever since I was a little girl.\"  \"Well, dearest,\" he said, after a moment, in which he held her very close and caressed her with exceeding tenderness, \"we shall not be far apart or miss passing some time together many days of the year. And you are not in haste to leave me?\"  \"Oh, no, no! why should I be? Please keep me a little while yet.\"  \"I intend to: it will take at least a year to get used to the thought of doing without you, and so long Travilla must be content to wait. Nor can we give you up wholly even then; your suite of rooms shall still be yours, and you must come now and then and occupy them for days or weeks at a time.  \"Now, daughter, good-night. Come to me to-morrow morning in my study, soon after breakfast, I have something more of importance to say to you.\"  \"I shall obey, and without fear,\" she answered gayly, \"though I remember once being quite frightened at a similar order; but that was when I was a silly little girl and didn't know how dearly my own papa loved me.\"  \"And when he was strangely stern to his own little child,\" he answered, with another tender caress.     CHAPTER THIRD.      \"So fair that had you beauty's picture took,      It must like her, or not like beauty look.\"                           --ALLEYN'S HENRY VII.   Elsie paused at the half-open door of her father's private room.  Mr. Dinsmore, like most men, was fond of light and air; through the wide open windows the morning breeze stole softly in, laden with sweets from garden and lawn, and the rich carpet of oak and green was flecked with gold where the sunbeams came shimmering down between the fluttering leaves of a beautiful vine that had festooned itself about the one looking to the east.  Mr. Dinsmore was seated at his desk with a pile of papers before him--legal documents in appearance; he would open one, glance over its contents, lay it aside, and take up another only to treat it in like manner.  Elsie stood but a moment watching him with loving, admiring eyes, then gliding noiselessly across the floor, dropped gracefully at his feet and laying her folded hands upon his knee looked up into his face with an arch, sweet smile.  \"Mon père, I have come for my lecture, or whatever you have laid up in store for me,\" she announced with mock gravity and a slight tremble of pretended fear in her voice.  Dropping the paper he held, and passing one hand caressingly over her shining hair, \"My darling, how very, very lovely you are!\" he said, the words bursting spontaneously from his lips; \"there is no flaw in your beauty, and your face beams with happiness.\"  \"Papa turned flatterer!\" she cried, springing up and allowing him to draw her to his knee.  \"I'm waiting for the lecture,\" she said presently, \"you know I always like to have disagreeable things over as soon as possible.\"  \"Who told you there was to be a lecture?\"  \"Nobody, sir.\"  \"What have you been doing that you feel entitles you to one?\"  \"I don't remember.\"  \"Nor I either. So let us to business. Here, take this chair beside me. Do you know how much you are worth?\"  \"Not precisely, sir,\" she answered demurely, taking the chair and folding her hands pensively in her lap; \"but very little, I presume, since you have given me away for nothing.\"  \"By no means,\" he said, with a slight smile of amusement at her unwonted mood. \"It was for your own happiness, which is no trifle in my esteem. But you belong to me still.\"  She looked at him with glistening eyes. \"Thank you, dearest papa; yes, I do belong to you and always shall. Please excuse my wilful misunderstanding of your query. I do not know how much money and other property I own, but have an idea it is a million more or less.\"  \"My dear child!--it is fully three times that.\"  \"Papa! is it indeed?\"  \"Yes, it was about a million at the time of your Grandfather Grayson's death, and has increased very much during your mamma's minority and yours; which you know has been a very long one. You own several stores and a dwelling house in New Orleans, a fine plantation with between two and three hundred negroes, and I have invested largely for you in stocks of various kinds both in your own country and in England. I wish you to examine all the papers, certificates of stock, bonds, deeds, mortgages, and so forth.\"  \"Oh, papa!\" she cried, lifting her hands in dismay, \"what a task. Please excuse me. You know all about it, and is not that sufficient?\"  \"No, the property is yours; I have been only your steward, and must now render up an account to you for the way in which I have handled your property.\"  \"You render an account to _me_, my own dear father,\" she said low and tremulously, while her face flushed crimson; \"I cannot bear to hear you speak so. I am fully satisfied, and very, _very_ thankful for all your kind care of it and of me.\"  He regarded her with a smile of mingled tenderness and amusement, while softly patting and stroking the small white hand laid lovingly upon his.  \"Could I--could any father--do less for his own beloved child?\" he asked.  \"Not you, I know, papa. But may I ask you a question?\"  \"As many as you like.\"  \"How much are you worth? Ah! you needn't look so quizzical. I mean how much do you own in money, land, etc.?\"  \"Something less than a million; I cannot tell you the exact number of dollars and cents.\"  \"Hardly a third as much as I! It doesn't seem right. Papa, take half of mine.\"  \"That wouldn't balance the scales either,\" he said laughingly; \"and besides, Mr. Travilla has now some right to be consulted.\"  \"Papa, I could never love him again, if he should object to my giving you all but a few hundred thousands.\"  \"He would not. He says he will never touch a cent of your property; it must be settled entirely upon yourself, and subject to your control. And that is quite right; for he, too, is wealthy.\"  \"Papa, I don't think I deserve so much; I don't want the care of so much. I do wish you would be so good as to take half for your own, and continue to manage the other half for me as you think best.\"  \"What you deserve is not the question just now. This is one of the talents which God has given you, and I think you ought, at least for the present, to keep the principal and decide for yourself what shall be done with the interest. You are old enough now to do so, and I hope do not wish to shirk the responsibility, since God, in His good providence, has laid it upon you.\"  He spoke very gravely and Elsie's face reflected the expression of his.  \"No, I do not wish it now, papa,\" she said, in a low, sweet voice. \"I will undertake it, asking Him for wisdom and grace to do it aright.\"  They were busy for the next hour or two over the papers.  \"There!\" cried Elsie, at length, \"we have examined the last one, and I think I understand it all pretty thoroughly.\"  \"I think you do. And now another thing; ought you not to go and see for yourself your property in Louisiana?\"  Elsie assented, on condition that he would take her.  \"Certainly, my dear child, can you suppose I would ever think of permitting you to go alone?\"  \"Thank you, papa. And if poor mammy objects this time, she may take her choice of going or staying; but go I must, and see how my poor people are faring at Viamede. I have dim, dreamy recollections of it as a kind of earthly paradise. Papa, do you know why mammy has always been so distressed whenever I talked of going there?\"  \"Painful associations, no doubt. Poor creature! it was there her husband--an unruly negro belonging to a neighboring planter--was sold away from her, and there she lost her children, one by accidental drowning, the others by some epidemic disease. Your own mother, too, died there, and Chloe I think never loved one of her own children better.\"  \"No, I'm sure not. But she never told me of her husband and children, and I thought she had never had any. And now, papa, that we are done with business for the present, I have a request to make.\"  \"Well, daughter, what is it?\"  \"That you will permit me to renew my old intimacy with Lucy Carrington; or at least to call on her. You remember she was not well enough to be at the wedding; she is here at Ashlands with her baby. Mr. and Mrs. Carrington called here yesterday while you were out, and both urged me not to be ceremonious with Lucy, as she is hardly well enough to make calls and is longing to see me.\"  \"And what answer did you give them?\" he asked with some curiosity.  \"That I should do so if possible; that meant if I could obtain your permission, papa.\"  \"You have it. Lucy is in some sort taken into the family now, and you are safely engaged; to say nothing of your mature years,\" he added laughingly, as she seated herself on his knee again and thanked him with a hug and kiss.  \"You dear good papa!\"  \"Some girls of your age, heiresses in their own right, would merely have said, 'I'm going,' never asking permission.\"  \"Ah, but I like to be ruled by you. So please don't give it up. Now about Enna?\"  \"If I had any authority in the matter, I should say, you shall not give her a cent. She doesn't deserve it from you or any one.\"  \"Then I shall wait till you change your mind.\"  Mr. Dinsmore shook his head. \"Ah! my little girl, you don't realize how much some one else's opinions will soon weigh with you,\" he answered, putting an arm about her and looking with fatherly delight into the sweet face.  \"Ah, papa!\" she cried, laying her cheek to his, \"please don't talk so; it hurts me.\"  \"Then, dearest, I shall not say it again, though indeed I was not reproaching you; it is right, very right, that husband and wife should be more than all the world beside to each other.\"  Elsie's cheek crimsoned. \"It has not come to that yet, father dear,\" she murmured, half averting her blushing face; \"and--I don't know which of you I love best--or how I"]]]
