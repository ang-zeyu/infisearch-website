Sometimes in almost the same sense, but with some kind of diminution thereof, the termination some is added, denoting something, or in some degree; as delight, delightsome; game, gamesome; irk, irksome; burden, burdensome; trouble, troublesome; light, lightsome; hand, handsome; alone, lonesome; toil, toilsome.  On the contrary, the termination less added to substantives, makes adjectives signifying want; as, worthless, witless, heartless, joyless, careless, helpless. Thus comfort, comfortless; sap, sapless.  Privation or contrariety is very often denoted by the participle un prefixed to many adjectives, or in before words derived from the Latin; as pleasant, unpleasant; wise, unwise; profitable, unprofitable, patient, impatient. Thus unworthy, unhealthy, unfruitful, unuseful, and many more.      The original English privative is un; but as we often borrow trom the     Latin, or its descendants, words already signifying privation, as     inefficacious, impious, indiscreet, the inseparable particles un and in     have fallen into confusion, from which it is not easy to disentangle     them.      Un is prefixed to all words originally English, as untrue, untruth,     untaught, unhandsome.      Un is prefixed to all participles made privative adjectives, as     unfeeling, unassisting, unaided, undelighted, unendeared.      Un ought never to be prefixed to a participle present to mark a     forbearance of action, as unsighing, but a privation of habit, as     unpitying.      Un is prefixed to most substantives which have an English termination,     as unfertileness, unperfectness, which, if they have borrowed     terminations, take in or im, as infertility, imperfection; uncivil,     incivility; unactive, inactivity.      In borrowing adjectives, if we receive them already compounded, it is     usual to retain the particle prefixed, as indecent, inelegant,     improper; but if we borrow the adjective, and add the privative     particle, we commonly prefix un, as unpolite, ungallant.  The prepositive particles dis and mis, derived from the des and mes of the French, signify almost the same as un; yet dis rather imports contrariety than privation, since it answers to the Latin preposition de. Mis insinuates some errour, and for the most part may be rendered by the Latin words male or perperam. To like, to dislike; honour, dishonour; to honour, to grace, to dishonour, to disgrace; to deign, to disdeign; chance, hap, mischance, mishap; to take, to mistake; deed, misdeed; to use, to misuse; to employ, to misemploy, to apply, to misapply.  Words derived from Latin written with de or dis retain the same signification; as distinguish, distinguo; detract, detraho; defame, defamo; detain, detineo.  The termination ly added to substantives, and sometimes to adjectives, forms adjectives that import some kind of similitude or agreement, being formed by contraction of lick or like. A giant, giantly, giantlike; earth, earthly; heaven, heavenly; world, worldly; God, godly; good, goodly.  The same termination ly, added to adjectives, forms adverbs of like signification; as, beautiful, beautifully; sweet, sweetly; that is, in a beautiful manner; with some degree of sweetness.  The termination ish added to adjectives, imports diminution; and added to substantives, imports similitude or tendency to a character; as green, greenish; white, whitish; soft, softish; a thief, thievish; a wolf, wolfish; a child, childish.  We have forms of diminutives in substantives, though not frequent; as a hill, a hillock; a cock, a cockrel; a pike, a pickrel; this is a French termination: a goose, a gosling; this is a German termination: a lamb, a lambkin; a chick, a chicken; a man, a manikin; a pipe, a pipkin; and thus Halkin, whence the patronymick, Hawkins; Wilkin, Thomkin, and others.      Yet still there is another form of diminution among the English, by     lessening the sound itself, especially of vowels, as there is a form of     augmenting them by enlarging or even lengthening it; and that sometimes     not so much by change of the letters, as of their pronunciation; as,     sup, sip, soop, sop, sippet, where, besides the extenuation of the     vowel, there is added the French termination et; top, tip; spit, spout;     babe, baby; booby, Βουπαις; great pronounced long, especially if with a     stronger sound, grea-t; little, pronounced long lee-tle; ting, tang,     tong, imports a succession of smaller and then greater sounds; and so     in jingle, jangle, tingle, tangle, and many other made words.      Much however of this is arbitrary and fanciful, depending wholly on     oral utterance, and therefore scarcely worthy the notice of Wallis.  Of concrete adjectives are made abstract substantives, by adding the termination ness; and a few in hood or head, noting character or qualities: as white, whiteness; hard, hardness; great, greatness; skilful, skilfulness, unskilfulness; godhead, manhood, maidenhead, widowhood, knighthood, priesthood, likelihood, falsehood.  There are other abstracts, partly derived from adjectives, and partly from verbs, which are formed by the addition of the termination th, a small change being sometimes made; as long, length; strong, strength; broad, breadth; wide, width, deep, depth; true, truth; warm, warmth; dear, dearth; slow, slowth; merry, mirth; heal, health; well, weal, wealth; dry, drought; young, youth; and so moon, month.  Like these are some words derived from verbs; die, death; till, tilth; grow, growth; mow, later mowth, after mowth; commonly spoken and written later math, after math; steal, stealth; bear, birth, rue, ruth; and probably earth, from to ear or plow; fly, flight; weigh, weight; fray, fright; draw, draught.      These should rather be written flighth, frighth, only that custom will     not suffer h to be twice repeated.      The same form retain faith, spight, wreathe, wrath, broth, froth,     breath, sooth, worth, light, wight, and the like, whose primitives are     either entirely obsolete, or seldom occur. Perhaps they are derived     from fey or foy, spry, wry, wreak, brew, mow, fry, bray, say, work.  Some ending in ship, imply an office, employment, or condition; as, kingship, wardship, guardianship, partnership, stewardship, headship, lordship.      Thus worship, that is, worthship; whence worshipful, and to worship.  Some few ending in dom, rick, wick, do especially denote dominion, at least state or condition; as, kingdom, dukedom, earldom, princedom, popedom, Christendom, freedom, wisdom, whoredom, bishoprick, bailiwick.  Ment and age are plainly French terminations and are of the same import with us as among them, scarcely ever occurring, except in words derived from the French, as commandment, usage.      There are in English often long trains of words allied by their meaning     and derivation; as, to beat, a bat, batoon, a battle, a beetle, a     battledore, to batter, batter, a kind of glutinous composition for     food, made by beating different bodies into one mass. All these are of     similar signification, and perhaps derived from the Latin batuo. Thus     take, touch, tickle, tack, tackle; all imply a local conjunction from     the Latin tango, tetigi, tactum.      From two are formed twain, twice, twenty, twelve, twins, twine, twist,     twirl, twig, twitch, twinge, between, betwixt, twilight, twibil.      The following remarks, extracted from Wallis, are ingenious but of more     subtlety than solidity, and such as perhaps might in every language be     enlarged without end.      Sn usually imply the nose, and what relates to it. From the Latin nasus     are derived the French nez and the English nose; and nesse, a     promontory, as projecting like a nose. But as if from the consonants ns     taken from nasus, and transposed that they may the better correspond,     sn denote nasus; and thence are derived many words that relate to the     nose, as snout, sneeze, snore, snort,snear, snicker, snot, snivel,     snite, snuff, snuffle, snaffle, snarl, snudge.      There is another sn which may perhaps be derived from the Latin sinuo,     as snake, sneak, snail, snare; so likewise snap and snatch, snib, snub.     Bl imply a blast; as blow, blast, to blast, to blight, and,     metaphorically, to blast one's reputation; bleat, bleak, a bleak place,     to look bleak, or weather-beaten, black, blay, bleach, bluster, blurt,     blister, blab, bladder, blew, blabber lip't, blubber-cheek't, bloted,     blote-herrings, blast, blaze, to blow, that is, blossom, bloom; and     perhaps blood and blush.      In the native words of our tongue is to be found a great agreement     between the letters and the thing signified; and therefore the sounds     of the letters smaller, sharper, louder, closer, softer, stronger,     clearer, more obscure, and more stridulous, do very often intimate the     like effects in the things signified.      Thus words that begin with str intimate the force and effect of the     thing signified, as if probably derived from στρωννυμι, or strenuous;     as strong, strength, strew, strike, streak, stroke, stripe, strive,     strife, struggle, strout, strut, stretch, strait, strict, streight,     that is, narrow, distrain, stress, distress, string, strap, stream,     streamer, strand, strip, stray, struggle, strange, stride, stradale.      St in like manner imply strength, but in a less degree, so much only as     is sufficient to preserve what has been already communicated, rather     than acquire any new degree; as if it were derived from the Latin sto;     for example, stand, stay, that is, to remain, or to prop; staff, stay,     that is, to oppose; stop, to stuff, stifle, to stay, that is, to stop;     a stay, that is, an obstacle; stick, stut, stutter, stammer, stagger,   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],["title","A Grammar of the English Tongue (#7)"],["body","  stickle, stick, stake, a sharp, pale, and any thing deposited at play;     stock, stem, sting, to sting, stink, stitch, stud, stuncheon, stub,     stubble, to stub up, stump, whence stumble, stalk, to stalk, step, to     stamp with the feet, whence to stamp, that is, to make an impression     and a stamp; stow, to stow, to bestow, steward, or stoward; stead,     steady, stedfast, stable, a stable, a stall, to stall, stool, stall,     still, stall, stallage, stage, still, adjective, and still, adverb:     stale, stout, sturdy, stead, stoat, stallion, stiff, stark-dead, to     starve with hunger or cold; stone, steel, stern, stanch, to stanch     blood, to stare, steep, steeple, stair, standard, a stated measure,     stately. In all these, and perhaps some others, st denote something     firm and fixed.      Thr imply a more violent degree of motion, as throw, thrust, throng,     throb, through, threat, threaten, thrall, throws.      Wr imply some sort of obliquity or distortion, as wry, to wreathe,     wrest, wrestle, wring, wrong, wrinch, wrench, wrangle, wrinkle, wrath,     wreak, wrack, wretch, wrist, wrap.      Sw imply a silent agitation, or a softer kind of lateral motion; as     sway, swag, to sway, swagger, swerve, sweat, sweep, swill, swim, swing,     swift, sweet, switch, swinge.      Nor is there much difference of sm in smooth, smug, smile, smirk,     smite; which signifies the same as to strike, but is a softer word;     small, smell, smack, smother, smart, a smart blow properly signifies     such a kind of stroke as with an originally silent motion, implied in     sm, proceeds to a quick violence, denoted by ar suddenly ended, as is     shown by t.      Cl denote a kind of adhesion or tenacity, as in cleave, clay, cling,     climb, clamber, clammy, clasp, to clasp, to clip, to clinch, cloak,     clog, close, to close, a clod, a clot, as a clot of blood, clouted     cream, a clutter, a cluster.      Sp imply a kind of dissipation or expansion, especially a quick one,     particularly if there be an r, as if it were from spargo or separo: for     example, spread, spring, sprig, sprout, sprinkle, split, splinter,     spill, spit, sputter, spatter.      Sl denote a kind of silent fall, or a less observable motion; as in     slime, slide, slip, slipper, sly, sleight, slit, slow, slack, slight,     sling, slap.      And so likewise ash, in crash, rash, gash, flash, clash, lash, slash,     plash, trash, indicate something acting more nimbly and sharply. But     ush, in crush, rush, gush, flush, blush, brush, hush, push, imply     something as acting more obtusely and dully. Yet in both there is     indicated a swift and sudden motion not instantaneous, but gradual, by     the continued sound, sh.      Thus in fling, sling, ding, swing, cling, sing, wring, sting, the     tingling of the termination ng, and the sharpness of the vowel i, imply     the continuation of a very slender motion or tremor, at length indeed     vanishing, but not suddenly interrupted. But in tink, wink, sink,     clink, chink, think, that end in a mute consonant, there is also     indicated a sudden ending.      If there be an l, as in jingle, tingle, tinkle, mingle, sprinkle,     twinkle, there is implied a frequency, or iteration of small acts. And     the same frequency of acts, but less subtile by reason of the clearer     vowel a, is indicated in jangle, tangle, spangle, mangle, wrangle,     brangle, dangle; as also in mumble, grumble, jumble. But at the same     time the close u implies something obscure or obtunded; and a congeries     of consonants mbl, denotes a confused kind of rolling or tumbling, as     in ramble, scamble, scramble, wamble, amble; but in these there is     something acute.      In nimble, the acuteness of the vowel denotes celerity. In sparkle, sp     denotes dissipation, ar an acute crackling, k a sudden interruption, l     a frequent iteration; and in like manner in sprinkle, unless in may     imply the subtilty of the dissipated guttules. Thick and thin differ in     that the former ends with an obtuse consonant, and the latter with an     acute.      In like manner, in squeek, squeak, squeal, squall, brawl, wraul, yaul,     spaul, screek, shriek, shrill, sharp, shrivel, wrinkle, crack, crash,     clash, gnash, plash, crush, hush, hisse, fisse, whist, soft, jar, hurl,     curl, whirl, buz, bustle, spindle, dwindle, twine, twist, and in many     more, we may observe the agreement of such sort of sounds with the     things signified; and this so frequently happens, that scarce any     language which I know can be compared with ours. So that one     monosyllable word, of which kind are almost all ours, emphatically     expresses what in other languages can scarce be explained but by     compounds, or decompounds, or sometimes a tedious circumlocution.  We have many words borrowed from the Latin; but the greatest part of them were communicated by the intervention of the French; as, grace, face, elegant, elegance, resemble.  Some verbs which seem borrowed from the Latin, are formed from the present tense, and some from the supines.  From the present are formed spend, expend, expendo; conduce, conduco; despise, despicio; approve, approbo; conceive, concipio.  From the supines, supplicate, supplico; demonstrate, demonstro; dispose, dispono; expatiate, expatior; suppress, supprimo; exempt, eximo.      Nothing is more apparent than that Wallis goes too far in quest of     originals. Many of these which seem selected as immediate descendants     from the Latin, are apparently French, as, conceive, approve, expose,     exempt.  Some words purely French, not derived from the Latin, we have transferred into our language; as, garden, garter, buckler, to advance, to cry, to plead, from the French jardin, jartier, bouclier, avancer, crier, plaider; though, indeed, even of these part is of Latin original.      As to many words which we have in common with the Germans, it is     doubtful whether the old Teutons borrowed them from the Latins, or the     Latins from the Teutons, or both had them from some common original; as     wine, vinum; wind, ventus; went, veni; way, via, wall, vallum; wallow,     volvo; wool, vellus; will, volo; worm, vermis; worth, virtus; wasp,     vespa; day, dies; draw, traho; tame, domo, δαμαω; yoke, jugum, ζευγος;     over, upper, super, ‛υπερ; am, sum, ειμι; break, frango; fly, volo;     blow, flo. I make no doubt but the Teutonick is more ancient than the     Latin: and it is no less certain, that the Latin, which borrowed a     great number of words not only from the Greek, especially the Æolick,     but from other neighbouring languages, as the Oscan and others, which     have long become obsolete, received not a few from the Teutonick. It is     certain, that the English, German, and other Teutonick languages,     retained some derived from the Greek, which the Latin has not; as, ax,     achs, mit, ford, pfurd, daughter, tochter, mickle, mingle, moon, sear,     oar, grave, graff, to grave, to scrape, whole, from αξινη, μετα,     πορθμος, θυγατηρ, μεγαλος, μιγνυω, μηνη, ξηρος, γραφω, ‛ολος. Since     they received these immediately from the Greeks, without the     intervention of the Latin language, why may not other words be derived     immediately from the same fountain, though they be likewise found among     the Latins?  Our ancestors were studious to form borrowed words, however long, into monosyllables; and not only cut off the formative terminations, but cropped the first syllable, especially in words beginning with a vowel; and rejected not only vowels in the middle, but likewise consonants of a weaker sound, retaining the stronger, which seem the bones of words, or changing them for others of the same organ, in order that the sound might become the softer; but especially transposing their order, that they might the more readily be pronounced without the intermediate vowels. For example in expendo, spend; exemplum, sample; excipio, scape; extraneus, strange; extractum, stretch'd; excrucio, to screw; exscorio, to scour; excorio, to scourge; excortico, to scratch; and others beginning with ex: as also, emendo, to mend; episcopus, bishop, in Danish bisp; epistola, epistle; hospitale, spittle; Hispania, Spain; historia, story.      Many of these etymologies are doubtful, and some evidently mistaken.      The following are somewhat harder, Alexander, Sander; Elisabetha,     Betty; apis, bee; aper, bar; p passing into b, as in bishop; and by     cutting off a from the beginning, which is restored in the middle; but     for the old bar or bare, we now say boar; as for lang, long, for bain,     bane; for stane, stone; aprugna, brawn, p, being changed into b and a     transposed, as in aper, and g changed into w, as in pignus, pawn; lege,     law; αλωπηξ, fox, cutting off the beginning, and changing p into f, as     in pellis, a fell; pullus, a foal; pater, father; pavor, fear; polio,     file; pleo, impleo, fill, full; piscis, fish; and transposing o into     the middle, which was taken from the beginning; apex, a piece; peak,     pike; zophorus, freese; mustum, stum; defensio, fence; dispensator,     spencer; asculto, escouter, Fr. scout; exscalpo, scrape; restoring l     instead of r, and hence scrap, scrabble, scrawl; exculpo, scoop;     exterritus, start; extonitus, attonitus, stonn'd; stomachus, maw;     offendo, fined; obstipo, stop; audere, dare; cavere, ware; whence,     a-ware, beware, wary, warn, warning; for the Latin v consonant formerly     sounded like our w, and the modern sound of the v consonant was     formerly that of the letter f, that is, the Æolick digamma, which had     the sound of φ, and the modern sound of the letter f was that of the     Greek φ or ph; ulcus, ulcere, ulcer, sore, and hence sorry, sorrow,     sorrowful; ingenium, engine, gin, scalenus, leaning, unless you would     rather derive it from κλινω, whence inclino; infundibulum, funnel;"]]]
