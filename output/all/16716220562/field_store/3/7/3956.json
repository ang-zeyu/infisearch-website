Doe proffered four of those on the back of his narrow, cream-coloured right hand. He did it readily enough, but trembled a little, and the blush that had disappeared returned at a rush to his neck. Radley took his ruler, and struck the knuckles with a very sharp rap. Doe's lips snapped together and remained together,--and that was all.  \"And Ray,\" invited Radley.  I offered the back of my right hand, and, copying my friend, kept my lips well closed. My eyes had shut themselves nervously, when I heard a clatter, and realised that Radley had dropped his ruler. Leaving my right hand extended for punishment, I stooped down, picked up the ruler with my left, and gave it back to Radley. Perhaps the blood that now coloured my face was partly due to this stooping. Radley smiled. It was his habit to become suddenly gentle after being hard. One second, his hard mouth would frame hard things; another second, and his grey eyes would redress the balance.  \"Ray, you disarm me,\" he said. \"Go to your seats, both of you.\"  Back we walked abreast to our places, Doe palpably annoyed that he had not been the one to pick up the ruler. He was a romantic youth and would have liked to occupy my picturesque and rather heroic position.  \"Why didn't you let me pick up the ruler?\" he whispered. \"You knew I wanted to.\"  This utterly senseless remark I had no opportunity of answering, so I determined to sulk with Doe, as soon as the interval should arrive. When, however, the bell rang for that ten-minutes' excitement, I forgot everything in the glee of thinking that the second period would be spent with Herr Reinhardt. Ten minutes to go, and then--and then, Mr. Cæsar!   §3  In the long corridor, on to which Radley's class-room opened, gathered our elated form, awaiting the arrival of Herr Reinhardt. He was late. He always was: and it was a mistake to be so, for it gave us the opportunity, when he drew near, of asking one another the time in French: \"Kell er eight eel? Onze er ay dammy. Wee, wee.\"  Cæsar Reinhardt, the German, remains upon my mind chiefly as being utterly unlike a German: he was a long man, very deaf, with drooping English moustaches, and such obviously weak eyes that now, whenever Leah's little eye-trouble is read in Genesis, I always think of Reinhardt. But I think of him as \"Mr. Cæsar.\" Why \"Mr. Cæsar\" and not purely \"Cæsar\" I cannot explain, but the \"Mr.\" was inseparable from the nickname. Good Mr. Cæsar was misplaced in his profession. Had he not been obliged to spend his working life in the position of one who has just been made to look a fool, he would have been an attractive and lovable person. He had the most beautiful tenor voice, which, when he spoke was like liquid silver, and, when he sang elaborate opera passages, made one see glorious wrought-steel gateways of heavenly palaces. This inefficient master owed his position to the great vogue enjoyed by his books: \"Reinhardt's German Conversation,\" \"Reinhardt's French Pieces,\" and others. But the boys, by common consent, decided not to identify this \"Cæsar Reinhardt, Modern Language Master at Kensingtowe School\" with their own dear Mr. Cæsar. Thus, you see, in their ignorance, they were able to bring up the Reinhardt works to Mr. Cæsar, and say with worried brows: \"Here, sir. This bally book's all wrong\"; \"I could write a better book than this myself, sir\"; \"The Johnny who wrote this book, sir--well, _st. st._\" Pennybet, however, used to tremble on the brink of identification, when he made the idiotic mistake of saying: \"Shall I bring up my Cæsar, sir,--I mean, my Reinhardt?\"  The jubilation of our class, as we lolled or clog-danced in the corridor, had need to be organised into some systematic fooling; and for once in a way, the boys accepted a suggestion of mine.  \"Let's all hum 'God Save the King' exactly at twelve o'clock. Mr. Cæsar won't hear; he's too deaf.\"  Immediately several boys started to sing the popular air in question, and others went for a slide along the corridor, both of which performances are generally construed as meaning: \"Right-ho!\"  \"It's crude,\" commented Penny, \"but I'll not interfere. I might even help you--who knows? And here comes Mr. Cæsar. Ah, wee, wee.\"  It was our custom to race in a body along the corridor to meet Mr. Cæsar, and to arrive breathless at his side, where we would fight to walk, one on his right hand, and another on his left. In the course of a brilliant struggle several boys would be prostrated, not unwillingly. We would then escort him in triumph to his door, and all offer to turn the lock, crying: \"Let _me_ have the key, sir.\" \"Do let _me_, sir.\" \"You never let _me_, sir--dashed unfair.\" When someone had secured the key, he would fling wide the door, as though to usher in all the kings of Asia, but promptly spoil this courtly action by racing after the door ere it banged against the wall, holding it in an iron grip like a runaway horse, and panting horribly at the strain. This morning I was honoured with the key. I examined it and saw that it was stuffed up with dirt and there would be some delay outside the class-room door while the key underwent alterations and repairs.  \"Has any boy,\" I asked, \"a pin?\"  None had; but Pennybet offered to go to Bramhall House in search of one. He could do it in twenty minutes, he said.  \"Dear me, how annoying!\" I shook the key, I hammered it, I blew down it till it gave forth a shrill whistle, and Penny said: \"Off side.\" And then I giggled into the key.  Don't think Mr. Cæsar tolerated all this without a mild protest. I distinctly remember his saying in his silvery voice: \"Give it to me, Ray. I'll do it,\" and my replying, as I looked up into his delicate eyes: \"No, it's all right, sir. You leave it to me, sir.\"  In due course I threw open the door with a triumphant \"There!\" The door hit the side-wall with a bang that upset the nervous systems of neighbouring boys, who felt a little faint, had hysterics, and recovered. Mr. Cæsar, feeling that the class was a trifle unpunctual in starting, hurriedly entered.  Then Pennybet distinguished himself. He laid his books unconcernedly on the master's desk, and walked with a dandy's dignity to the window. Having surveyed the view with a critical air, he faced round and addressed Mr. Cæsar courteously: \"May I shut the window for you, sir?\" adding in a lower tone that he was always willing to oblige. Without waiting for the permission to be granted, he turned round again and, pulling up each sleeve that his cuffs might not be soiled in the operation, proceeded to turn the handle, by means of which the lofty window was closed.  Now there were four long windows in a row, and they all needed shutting--this beautiful summer morning. None of us was to be outdone in politeness by Penny; and all rushed to the coveted handles so as to be first in shutting the remaining windows. The element of competition and the steeplechasing methods necessary, if we were to surmount the intervening desks, made it all rather exciting. Several boys, converging from different directions, arrived at the handles at the same time. It was natural, then, that a certain amount of discussion should follow as to whose right it was to shut the windows, and that the various little assemblies debating the point should go and refer the question simultaneously to Mr. Cæsar.  Mr. Cæsar gave his answer with some emphasis:  \"Will--you--all--sit--down?\"  This rhetorical question being in the nature of a command, we sullenly complied, tossing our heads to show our sense of the indignity to which we had been submitted. Pennybet, meanwhile, continued to turn his handle in a leisurely fashion and touch his forehead like an organ-grinder.  Mr. Cæsar looked at him angrily and pathetically, conscious of his powerlessness.  \"Que faites vous, Pennybet? Asseyez vous toute suite!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Penny, who had no sympathy with German, French, or any of these ludicrous languages. \"Yes, sir, we had two, and one died.\"  \"Que voulez vous dire? Allez à votre place!\"  \"It's all right, sir, if you cross your fingers,\" suggested Penny.  Poor Mr. Cæsar made a movement, as though he would go and push the mutineer to his place.  \"You will go to your seat immediately, Pennybet,\" he ordered.  Penny cocked his head on one side. \"Oh, _sir_,\" said he reproachfully.  Our friend always expressed his sense of injustice with this sad \"Oh, _sir_,\" and, as he generally detected a vein of injustice in any demand made upon him, the expression was of frequent occurrence.  Mr. Cæsar first moved his lips incompetently, and then, with a studied slowness that was meant to sound imperious, began:  \"When I say 'Sit'--\"  \"You mean 'Sit,'\" explained Penny promptly.  \"That's impertinence.\"  But Penny had his head thrown back, and was gazing out of eyes, curtained by the fall of heavy-fringed lids, at the ceiling.  \"Pennybet,\" cried his master, his very voice apprehensive, \"will you have the goodness to attend?\"  \"Oh, ah, yes, sir,\" agreed Penny, awaking from his reverie.  \"You haven't the manners of a savage, boy.\"  \"Oh, _sir_.\"  Mr. Cæsar bit his lip, and his silver voice would scarcely come.  \"Or of a pig!\"  \"Would a pig have manners, sir?\" corrected Penny.  \"That's consummate impudence!\"  \"Oh, is it, sir?\" Penny's tone suggested that he was grateful for the enlightenment. Henceforth he would not be in two minds on the subject.  Mr. Cæsar, repulsed again by the more powerful character of the boy, tried to cover the feebleness of his position by sounding as threatening as possible.  \"Go to your seat at once! The impudence of this class is insufferable!\"  Loud murmurs of dissent from twenty boys greeted this aspersion. The class resolved itself into an Opposition, inspired by one object, which was to repudiate aspersions. Penny excellently voiced their resentment.  \"Oh, _sir_.\" (Opposition cheers.)  Mr. Cæsar hurled his chair behind him, and approached very close to Penny.  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15033"],["title","Tell England (#6)"],["body","you go to your seat at once?\"  Penny, with all his power, was still a boy; and for a moment the child in him flinched before the exceedingly close approach of Mr. Cæsar. But the next minute he looked up at the still open window; shivered, and shuddered; rubbed his cold hands (this beautiful summer morning); buttoned himself up warmly; went to the master's desk for his books; dropped them one after another; blew on his numbed fingers to infuse a little warmth into them, contriving a whistle, and all the time looking most rebukingly at his tyrannical master; picked up four books and dropped two of them; picked up those and dropped one more; walked to his seat in high sorrow, and banged the whole lot of the books down upon the desk and floor in an appalling cataract, as the full cruelty of Mr. Cæsar's treatment came suddenly home to him.  When we recovered from this shattering explosion of Penny's books, a little quiet work would have begun, had not Doe, with his romantic imagination lit by the glow of Penny's audacity, started to crave the notoriety of being likewise a leader of men. He rose from his desk, approached Mr. Cæsar, and extended his hand with a belated \"Good morning, sir.\"  Poor Mr. Cæsar, in the kindliness of his heart, was touched by Doe's graceful action, and grasped the proffered hand, saying: \"Good morning, Doe.\" By this time the whole class was arranged in a tolerably straight line behind Doe, and waiting to go through the ceremony of shaking hands.  Work commenced at about twenty minutes to twelve, and, when twelve should come, we were to render, according to programme, \"God Save the King,\" with some delicate humming. For want of something better to do, I wrote a clause of the exercise set. Mr. Cæsar's back was now turned and he was studying a wall-map.  \"Shall I?\"  \"Yes, rather!\"  These two whispered sentences I heard from behind me. Inquisitively I turned round to see what simmered there.  \"Keep working, you fool!\" hissed my neighbour.  Events of some moment were happening in the rear. It had occurred to several that the hands of the clock might be encouraged with a slight push to hasten their journey over the next few minutes. Doe, half anxious to be the daring one to do it, half nervous of the consequences, had whispered: \"Shall I?\" And his advisers had answered: \"Yes, rather!\" He threw down a piece of blotting paper, and tip-toed towards it, as though to pick it up. Seeing with a side-glance that Mr. Cæsar's back was still turned, he mounted a form, and pushed on the clock's hands. Then, hurriedly getting down, he flew back nervously to his seat, where he pretended to be rapidly writing.  Hearing these slithy and suggestive movements, I declined to remain any longer ignorant of their meaning. After all, I had suggested the \"whole bally business,\" and was entitled to know the means selected for its conduct. So round went my inquisitive head. Then I shook in my glee. Someone had pushed on the hands of the clock, and it was three minutes to twelve. There was a rustle of excitement in the room. The silence of expectancy followed. \"Two-minutes-to\" narrowed into \"One-minute-to\"; and after a premonitory click, which produced sufficient excitement to interfere with our breath, the clock struck twelve.  Inasmuch as I occupied a very favourable position, I got up to conduct proceedings. I faced the class, stretched out my right hand, which held a pen by way of a baton, and whispered: \"One. Two. _Three_.\"  It began. I have often wondered since how I could have been so wrong in my calculations. I had estimated that, if we all hummed, there would result a gentle murmur. I never dreamt that each of the twenty boys would respond so splendidly to my appeal. Instead of a gentle murmur, the National Hymn was opened with extraordinary volume and spirit.  My first instinct was the low one of self-preservation. Feeling no desire to play a leading part in this terrible outbreak, I hastily sat down with a view to resuming my studies. Unfortunately I sat down too heavily, and there was the noise of a bump, which served to bring the performance to an effective conclusion. My books clattered to the floor, and Mr. Cæsar turned on me with a cry of wrath.  \"Ray, what are you doing?\"  It was a sudden and awkward question; and, for a second, I was at a loss for words to express to my satisfaction what I was doing. Penny seemed disappointed at my declension into disgrace, and murmured reproachfully: \"O Rupert, my little Rupert, _st. st._\" I saw that the game was up. Mr. Cæsar had inquired what I was doing; and a survey of what I was doing showed me that, between some antecedent movements and some subsequent effects, my central procedure was a conducting of the class. So, very red but trying to be impudent, I said as much, after first turning round and making an unpleasant face at Penny.  \"Conducting, sir,\" I explained, as though nothing could be more natural at twelve o'clock.  \"Conducting!\" said Mr. Cæsar. \"Well, you may be able to conduct the class, but you certainly cannot conduct yourself.\"  This resembling a joke, the class expressed its appreciation in a prolonged and uproarious laugh. It was a stupendous laugh. It had fine crescendo and diminuendo passages, and only died hard, after a chain of intermittent \"Ha-ha's.\" Then it had a glorious resurrection, but faded at last into the distance, a few stray \"Ha-ha's\" from Pennybet bringing up the rear.  Mr. Cæsar trembled with impotent passion, his weak eyes eloquent with anger and suffering.  \"Are you responsible for this outrage, Ray?\"  I looked down and muttered: \"It was my suggestion, sir.\"  \"Then you shall suffer for it. Who has tampered with the clock?\"  There was no answer, and every boy looked at the remainder of the class to show his ignorance of the whole matter. Doe glanced from one to another for instructions. Some by facial movements suggested an avowal of his part, but he whispered: \"Not yet,\" and waited, blushing.  \"Then the whole class shall do two hours' extra work.\"  The words were scarcely out of Mr. Cæsar's mouth, before every boy was protesting. I caught above the confusion such complaints as: \"Oh, sir!\" \"But _really_, sir,\" or a more sullen: \"I never touched the beastly clock!\" or even a frank: \"I won't do it.\" I observed that Penny was taking advantage of the noise to deliver an emotional sermon, which he accompanied with passionate gestures and concluded by turning eastward and profanely repeating the ascription: \"And now to God the Father--\"  A sudden silence, and every boy sits awkwardly in his place. Radley's tall figure stood in the room: and the door was being shut by his hand. I kept my eyes fixed on him. I was changed. I no longer felt disorderly nor impudent: for disorderliness and impudence in me were but unnatural efforts to copy Pennybet, that master-fool. I dropped into my natural self, a thing of shyness and diffidence. I was not conscious of any ill-will towards Radley for returning to his class-room, when he was not expected; it was just a piece of bad fortune for me. I was about to be \"whacked,\" I knew; and, though I did not move, I felt strange emotions within me. Certainly I was a little afraid, for Radley whacked harder than they all.  And then, as usual, my brain ran down a wildly irrelevant course. I reflected that the height of my ambition would be reached, if I could grow into as tall a man as Radley. My frame, at present, gave no promise of developing into that of a very tall man; but henceforth I would do regular physical exercises of a stretching character, and eschew all evils that retarded the growth. In the enthusiasm of a new aim, towards which I would start this very day, I almost forgot my present embarrassing position. Hasty calculations followed as to how much I would have to grow each year. Let me see, how old was I? Just thirteen. How many years to grow in?  \"Who is the ringleader of this?\" asked Radley..  I stood up and whispered: \"Me, sir.\"  Somehow a ready acknowledgment seemed to agree with my latest ambition.  \"Then come and stand out here. You know you ought to be caned, so you'll thoroughly enjoy it. In fact, being a decent boy, you'd be miserable without it.\"  Here Mr. Cæsar, who bore no grudge against Radley for assuming the reins of command, whispered to him; and Radley asked the class:  \"Who touched the clock?\"  \"I did, sir.\"  It was Doe's voice.  \"Why didn't you say so before?\"  \"I was just going to when you came in.\"  Radley looked straight into the brown eyes of the boy who was supposed to be his favourite, and Doe looked back unshiftingly; he had heard those condemned, who did not look people straight in the face, and I fancy he rather exaggerated his steady return gaze.  \"I'm sure you were,\" said Radley.  Then the foreman of the other boys got up.  \"Some of us suggested it to Doe, sir.\"  \"Very well, you will have the punishment of seeing him suffer for it.\"  And thereupon, without waiting to be told, Doe left his desk, and came and stood by me. It was a theatrical action, such as only he would have done, and our master concealed his surprise, if he felt any, by an impassive face.  \"I shall now cane these two boys,\" he said with cold-blooded directness.  \"Certainly,\" whispered Penny.  Both corners of my mouth went down in a grim resignation. Doe's lips pressed themselves firmly together, and his eyelids trembled. Mr. Cæsar, ever generous, looked through the window over green lawns and flower-beds. Radley went to his cupboard, and took out a cane.  \"Bend over, Ray.\"  \"Certainly,\" muttered Penny again. \"Bend over.\"  I bent over, resting my hands on my knees. Radley was a cricketer with a big reputation for cutting and driving; and three drives, right in the middle of the cane, convinced me what a first-class hitter he was. At the fourth, an especially resounding one, Penny whistled a soft and prolonged whistle of amazement, and murmured: \"Well, _that's_ a boundary, anyway.\" And I heard"]]]
