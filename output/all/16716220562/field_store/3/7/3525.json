I know there will be spring; as surely as the birds know it when they see above the snow two tiny, quivering green leaves. Spring cannot fail us.  There were other flowers in the box once; a bunch of white acacia flowers, gathered by the strong hand of a man, as we passed down a village street on a sultry afternoon, when it had rained, and the drops fell on us from the leaves of the acacia trees. The flowers were damp; they made mildew marks on the paper I folded them in. After many years I threw them away. There is nothing of them left in the box now, but a faint, strong smell of dried acacia, that recalls that sultry summer afternoon; but the rose is in the box still.  It is many years ago now; I was a girl of fifteen, and I went to visit in a small up-country town. It was young in those days, and two days’ journey from the nearest village; the population consisted mainly of men. A few were married, and had their wives and children, but most were single. There was only one young girl there when I came. She was about seventeen, fair, and rather fully-fleshed; she had large dreamy blue eyes, and wavy light hair; full, rather heavy lips, until she smiled; then her face broke into dimples, and all her white teeth shone. The hotel-keeper may have had a daughter, and the farmer in the outskirts had two, but we never saw them. She reigned alone. All the men worshipped her. She was the only woman they had to think of. They talked of her on the stoep, at the market, at the hotel; they watched for her at street corners; they hated the man she bowed to or walked with down the street. They brought flowers to the front door; they offered her their horses; they begged her to marry them when they dared. Partly, there was something noble and heroic in this devotion of men to the best woman they knew; partly there was something natural in it, that these men, shut off from the world, should pour at the feet of one woman the worship that otherwise would have been given to twenty; and partly there was something mean in their envy of one another. If she had raised her little finger, I suppose, she might have married any one out of twenty of them.  Then I came. I do not think I was prettier; I do not think I was so pretty as she was. I was certainly not as handsome. But I was vital, and I was new, and she was old--they all forsook her and followed me. They worshipped me. It was to my door that the flowers came; it was I had twenty horses offered me when I could only ride one; it was for me they waited at street corners; it was what I said and did that they talked of. Partly I liked it. I had lived alone all my life; no one ever had told me I was beautiful and a woman. I believed them. I did not know it was simply a fashion, which one man had set and the rest followed unreasoningly. I liked them to ask me to marry them, and to say, No. I despised them. The mother heart had not swelled in me yet; I did not know all men were my children, as the large woman knows when her heart is grown. I was too small to be tender. I liked my power. I was like a child with a new whip, which it goes about cracking everywhere, not caring against what. I could not wind it up and put it away. Men were curious creatures, who liked me, I could never tell why. Only one thing took from my pleasure; I could not bear that they had deserted her for me. I liked her great dreamy blue eyes, I liked her slow walk and drawl; when I saw her sitting among men, she seemed to me much too good to be among them; I would have given all their compliments if she would once have smiled at me as she smiled at them, with all her face breaking into radiance, with her dimples and flashing teeth. But I knew it never could be; I felt sure she hated me; that she wished I was dead; that she wished I had never come to the village. She did not know, when we went out riding, and a man who had always ridden beside her came to ride beside me, that I sent him away; that once when a man thought to win my favour by ridiculing her slow drawl before me I turned on him so fiercely that he never dared come before me again. I knew she knew that at the hotel men had made a bet as to which was the prettier, she or I, and had asked each man who came in, and that the one who had staked on me won. I hated them for it, but I would not let her see that I cared about what she felt towards me.  She and I never spoke to each other.  If we met in the village street we bowed and passed on; when we shook hands we did so silently, and did not look at each other. But I thought she felt my presence in a room just as I felt hers.  At last the time for my going came. I was to leave the next day. Some one I knew gave a party in my honour, to which all the village was invited.  It was midwinter. There was nothing in the gardens but a few dahlias and chrysanthemums, and I suppose that for two hundred miles round there was not a rose to be bought for love or money. Only in the garden of a friend of mine, in a sunny corner between the oven and the brick wall, there was a rose tree growing which had on it one bud. It was white, and it had been promised to the fair haired girl to wear at the party.  The evening came; when I arrived and went to the waiting-room, to take off my mantle, I found the girl there already. She was dressed in pure white, with her great white arms and shoulders showing, and her bright hair glittering in the candle-light, and the white rose fastened at her breast. She looked like a queen. I said “Good-evening,” and turned away quickly to the glass to arrange my old black scarf across my old black dress.  Then I felt a hand touch my hair.  “Stand still,” she said.  I looked in the glass. She had taken the white rose from her breast, and was fastening it in my hair.  “How nice dark hair is; it sets off flowers so.” She stepped back and looked at me. “It looks much better there!”  I turned round.  “You are so beautiful to me,” I said.  “Y-e-s,” she said, with her slow Colonial drawl; “I’m so glad.”  We stood looking at each other.  Then they came in and swept us away to dance. All the evening we did not come near to each other. Only once, as she passed, she smiled at me.  The next morning I left the town.  I never saw her again.  Years afterwards I heard she had married and gone to America; it may or may not be so--but the rose--the rose is in the box still! When my faith in woman grows dim, and it seems that for want of love and magnanimity she can play no part in any future heaven; then the scent of that small withered thing comes back:--spring cannot fail us.  Matjesfontein, South Africa.     III. “THE POLICY IN FAVOUR OF PROTECTION--“.  Was it Right?--Was it Wrong?  A woman sat at her desk in the corner of a room; behind her a fire burnt brightly.  Presently a servant came in and gave her a card.  “Say I am busy and can see no one now. I have to finish this article by two o’clock.”  The servant came back. The caller said she would only keep her a moment: it was necessary she should see her.  The woman rose from her desk. “Tell the boy to wait. Ask the lady to come in.”  A young woman in a silk dress, with a cloak reaching to her feet, entered. She was tall and slight, with fair hair.  “I knew you would not mind. I wished to see you so!”  The woman offered her a seat by the fire. “May I loosen your cloak?--the room is warm.”  “I wanted so to come and see you. You are the only person in the world who could help me! I know you are so large, and generous, and kind to other women!” She sat down. Tears stood in her large blue eyes: she was pulling off her little gloves unconsciously.  “You know Mr.--” (she mentioned the name of a well-known writer): “I know you meet him often in your work. I want you to do something for me!”  The woman on the hearth-rug looked down at her.  “I couldn’t tell my father or my mother, or any one else; but I can tell you, though I know so little of you. You know, last summer he came and stayed with us a month. I saw a great deal of him. I don’t know if he liked me; I know he liked my singing, and we rode together--I liked him more than any man I have ever seen. Oh, you know it isn’t true that a woman can only like a man when he likes her; and I thought, perhaps, he liked me a little. Since we have been in town we have asked, but he has never come to see us. Perhaps people have been saying something to him about me. You know him, you are always meeting him, couldn’t you say or do anything for me?” She looked up with her lips white and drawn. “I feel sometimes as if I were going mad! Oh, it is so terrible to be a woman!” The woman looked down at her. “Now I hear he likes another woman. I don’t know who she is, but they say she is so clever, and writes. Oh, it is so terrible, I can’t bear it.”  The woman leaned her elbow against the mantelpiece, and her face against her hand. She looked down into the fire. Then she turned and looked at the younger woman. “Yes,” she said, “it is a very terrible thing to be a woman.” She was silent. She said with some difficulty: “Are you sure you love him? Are you sure it is not only the feeling a young girl has for an older man who is celebrated, and of whom every one is talking?”  “I have been nearly mad. I haven’t slept for weeks!” She knit her little hands together, till the jewelled rings almost cut into the fingers. “He is everything to me; there is nothing else in the world. You, who are so great, and strong, and clever, and who care only for your work, and for men as your friends, you cannot understand what it is when one person is everything to you, when there is nothing else in the world!”  “And what do you want me to do?”  “Oh, I don’t know!” She looked up. “A woman knows what she can do. Don’t tell him that I love him.” She "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1458"],["title","Dream Life and Real Life: A Little African Story (#3)"],["body","up again. “Just say something to him. Oh, it’s so terrible to be a woman; I can’t do anything. You won’t tell him exactly that I love him? That’s the thing that makes a man hate a woman, if you tell it him plainly.”  “If I speak to him I must speak openly. He is my friend. I cannot fence with him. I have never fenced with him in my own affairs.” She moved as though she were going away from the fireplace, then she turned and said: “Have you thought of what love is between a man and a woman when it means marriage? That long, long life together, day after day, stripped of all romance and distance, living face to face: seeing each other as a man sees his own soul? Do you realize that the end of marriage is to make the man and woman stronger than they were; and that if you cannot, when you are an old man and woman and sit by the fire, say, ‘Life has been a braver and a freer thing for us, because we passed it hand in hand, than if we had passed through it alone,’ it has failed? Do you care for him enough to live for him, not tomorrow, but when he is an old, faded man, and you an old, faded woman? Can you forgive him his sins and his weaknesses, when they hurt you most? If he were to lie a querulous invalid for twenty years, would you be able to fold him in your arms all that time, and comfort him, as a mother comforts her little child?” The woman drew her breath heavily.  “Oh, I love him absolutely! I would be glad to die, if only I could once know that he loved me better than anything in the world!”  The woman stood looking down at her. “Have you never thought of that other woman; whether she could not perhaps make his life as perfect as you?” she asked, slowly.  “Oh, no woman ever could be to him what I would be. I would live for him. He belongs to me.” She bent herself forward, not crying, but her shoulders moving. “It is such a terrible thing to be a woman, to be able to do nothing and say nothing!”  The woman put her hand on her shoulder; the younger woman looked up into her face; then the elder turned away and stood looking into the fire. There was such quiet, you could hear the clock tick above the writing-table.  The woman said: “There is one thing I can do for you. I do not know if it will be of any use--I will do it.” She turned away.  “Oh, you are so great and good, so beautiful, so different from other women, who are always thinking only of themselves! Thank you so much. I know I can trust you. I couldn’t have told my mother, or any one but you.”  “Now you must go; I have my work to finish.”  The younger woman put her arms round her. “Oh, you are so good and beautiful!”  The silk dress and the fur cloak rustled out of the room.  The woman who was left alone walked up and down, at last faster and faster, till the drops stood on her forehead. After a time she went up to the table; there was written illegibly in a man’s hand on a fragment of manuscript paper: “Can I come to see you this afternoon?” Near it was a closed and addressed envelope. She opened it. In it were written the words: “Yes, please, come.”  She tore it across and wrote the words: “No, I shall not be at liberty.”  She closed them in an envelope and addressed them. Then she rolled up the manuscript on the table and rang the bell. She gave it to the servant. “Tell the boy to give this to his master, and say the article ends rather abruptly; they must state it is to be continued; I will finish it tomorrow. As he passes No. 20 let him leave this note there.”  The servant went out. She walked up and down with her hands folded above her head.  *****  Two months after, the older woman stood before the fire. The door opened suddenly, and the younger woman came in.  “I had to come--I couldn’t wait. You have heard, he was married this morning? Oh, do you think it is true? Do help me!” She put out her hands.  “Sit down. Yes, it is quite true.”  “Oh, it is so terrible, and I didn’t know anything! Did you ever say anything to him?” She caught the woman’s hands.  “I never saw him again after the day you were here,--so I could not speak to him,--but I did what I could.” She stood looking passively into the fire.  “And they say she is quite a child, only eighteen. They say he only saw her three times before he proposed to her. Do you think it is true?”  “Yes, it is quite true.”  “He can’t love her. They say he’s only marrying her for her rank and her money.”  The woman turned quickly.  “What right have you to say that? No one but I know him. What need has he of any one’s rank or wealth? He is greater than them all! Older women may have failed him; he has needed to turn to her beautiful, fresh, young life to compensate him. She is a woman whom any man might have loved, so young and beautiful; her family are famed for their intellect. If he trains her, she may make him a better wife than any other woman would have done.”  “Oh, but I can’t bear it--I can’t bear it!” The younger woman sat down in the chair. “She will be his wife, and have his children.”  “Yes.” The elder woman moved quickly. “One wants to have the child, and lay its head on one’s breast and feed it.” She moved quickly. “It would not matter if another woman bore it, if one had it to take care of.” She moved restlessly.  “Oh, no, I couldn’t bear it to be hers. When I think of her I feel as if I were dying; all my fingers turn cold; I feel dead. Oh, you were only his friend; you don’t know!”  The older spoke softly and quickly, “Don’t you feel a little gentle to her when you think she’s going to be his wife and the mother of his child? I would like to put my arms round her and touch her once, if she would let me. She is so beautiful, they say.”  “Oh, I could never bear to see her; it would kill me. And they are so happy together today! He is loving her so!”  “Don’t you want him to be happy?” The older woman looked down at her. “Have you never loved him, at all?”  The younger woman’s face was covered with her hands. “Oh, it’s so terrible, so dark! and I shall go on living year after year, always in this awful pain! Oh, if I could only die!”  The older woman stood looking into the fire; then slowly and measuredly she said, “There are times, in life, when everything seems dark, when the brain reels, and we cannot see that there is anything but death. But, if we wait long enough, after long, long years, calm comes. It may be we cannot say it was well; but we are contented, we accept the past. The struggle is ended. That day may come for you, perhaps sooner than you think.” She spoke slowly and with difficulty.  “No, it can never come for me. If once I have loved a thing, I love it for ever. I can never forget.”  “Love is not the only end in life. There are other things to live for.”  “Oh, yes, for you! To me love is everything!”  “Now, you must go, dear.”  The younger woman stood up. “It has been such a comfort to talk to you. I think I should have killed myself if I had not come. You help me so. I shall always be grateful to you.”  The older woman took her hand.  “I want to ask something of you.”  “What is it?”  “I cannot quite explain to you. You will not understand. But there are times when something more terrible can come into a life than it should lose what it loves. If you have had a dream of what life ought to be, and you try to make it real, and you fail; and something you have killed out in your heart for long years wakes up and cries, ‘Let each man play his own game, and care nothing for the hand of his fellow! Each man for himself. So the game must be played!’ and you doubt all you have lived for, and the ground seems washing out under your feet--.” She paused. “Such a time has come to me now. If you would promise me that if ever another woman comes to seek your help, you will give it to her, and try to love her for my sake, I think it will help me. I think I should be able to keep my faith.”  “Oh, I will do anything you ask me to. You are so good and great.”  “Oh, good and great!--if you knew! Now go, dear.”  “I have not kept you from your work, have I?”  “No; I have not been working lately. Good-by, dear.”  The younger woman went; and the elder knelt down by the chair, and wailed like a little child when you have struck it and it does not dare to cry loud.  A year after; it was early spring again.  The woman sat at her desk writing; behind her the fire burnt brightly. She was writing a leading article on the causes which in differing peoples lead to the adoption of Free Trade or Protectionist principles.  The woman wrote on quickly. After a while the servant entered and laid a pile of letters on the table. “Tell the boy I shall have done in fifteen minutes.” She wrote on. Then she caught sight of the writing on one of the letters. She put down her pen, and opened it. It ran so:--  “Dear Friend,--I am writing to you, because I know you will rejoice to hear of my great happiness. Do you remember how you told me that day by the fire to wait, and after long, long years I should see that all was for the best? That time has come sooner than we hoped. Last week in Rome I was married to the best, noblest, most large-hearted of men. We are now in Florence together. You don’t know how beautiful all life is to me. I know now that the old passion was only a girl’s foolish dream. My husband is the first man I have ever truly loved. He loves me and understands me as no other man ever could. I am thankful that my dream was broken; God had better things in store for me. I don’t hate that woman any more; I love every one! How are you, dear? We shall come and see you as soon as we arrive in England. I always think of you so happy in your great work and helping other people. I don’t think now it is terrible to be a woman; it is lovely.  “I hope you are enjoying this beautiful spring weather.  “Yours, always full of gratitude and love,  “E--.”  The woman read the letter: then she stood up and walked towards the fire. She did not re-read it, but stood with it open in her hand, looking down into the "]]]
