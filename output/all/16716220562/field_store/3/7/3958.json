McGuffey Editions and Colophon are Trademarks of  John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York-Chichester-Weinheim-Brisbane-Singapore-Toronto   Copyright, 1879, by VAN ANTWERP, BRAGG & CO. Copyright, 1896, by AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY. Copyright, 1907 and 1920, by H. H. VAIL. M'G. REV 5TH EC. EP 310    PREFACE.  The plan of the revision of McGUFFEY'S FIFTH READER is the same as that pursued in the other books of the REVISED SERIES. The book has been considerably enlarged, but the new pieces have been added or substituted only after the most careful consideration, and where the advantages to be derived were assured.  It has been the object to obtain as wide a range of leading authors as possible, to present the best specimens of style, to insure interest in the subjects, to impart valuable information, and to exert a decided and healthful moral influence. Thus the essential characteristics of McGUFFEY'S READERS have been carefully kept intact.  The preliminary exercises have been retained, and are amply sufficient for drill in articulation, inflection, etc. The additional exercises on these subjects, formerly inserted between the lessons, have been omitted to make room for other valuable features of the REVISED SERIES.  A full understanding of the text is necessary in order to read it properly. As all the books of reference required for this purpose are not within the reach of the majority of pupils, full explanatory notes have been given, which, it is believed, will add greatly not only to the interest of the reading lessons, but also to their usefulness from an instructive point of view.  The definitions of the more difficult words have been given, as formerly; and the pronunciation has been indicated by diacritical marks, in conformity with the preceding books of the REVISED SERIES.  Particular attention is invited to the notices of authors. Comparatively few pupils have the opportunity of making a separate study of English and American literature, and the carefully prepared notices in the REVISED SERIES are designed, therefore, to supply as much information in regard to the leading authors as is possible in the necessarily limited space assigned. The publishers have desired to illustrate McGUFFEY'S READERS in a manner worthy of the text and of the high favor in which they are held throughout the United States. The most celebrated designers and engravers of the country have been employed for this purpose.  It has been the privilege of the publishers to submit the REVISIED SERIES to numerous eminent educators in all parts of the country. To the careful reviews and criticisms of these gentlemen is due, in a large measure, the present form of McGUFFEY'S READERS. The value of these criticisms, coming from practical sources of the highest authority, can not well be overestimated, and the publishers take this occasion to express their thanks and their indebtedness to all who have thus kindly assisted them in this work.  Especial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co. for their permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions of many of the foremost American authors whose works they publish.    CONTENTS.

The great object to be accomplished in reading, as a rhetorical exercise, is to convey to the hearer, fully and clearly, the ideas and feelings of the writer.  In order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully studied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with this view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:  RULE 1.--Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner should make himself fully acquainted with the subject as treated of in that lesson, and endeavor to make the thought and feeling and sentiments of the writer his own.  REMARK.--When he has thus identified himself with the author, he has the substance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature that we find rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in inflection or emphasis or modulation. The best speakers and readers are those who follow the impulse of nature, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.  II. ARTICULATION.  Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.  An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.  The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.  ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.--VOCALS.  Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.  DIRECTION.--Put the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position; pronounce the word in the chart forcibly, and with the falling inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals alone.  Table of Vocals.              Long Vocals. Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in -----   -----      -----   ----- a       hate         e     err a       hare         i     pine a       far          o     no a       pass         u     tube a       fall         u     burn e       eve         oo     cool              Short Vocals Vocal   as in      Vocal   as in -----   -----      -----   ----- a       mat          o     hot e       met          u     us i       it          oo     book    Diphthongs. Vocal     as in ------   -------- oi, oy   oil, boy ou, ow   out,now  REMARK 1.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite the same in quality as certain of the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in quantity.  REMARK 2. The vocals are often represented by other letters or combinations of letters than those used in the table; for instance, a is represented by ai in hail, ea in steak, etc.  REMARK 3.--As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be articulated with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance.    SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.  Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.  Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.  Words ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for practice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements at first in concert, then separately.  Table of Subvocals and Aspirates. Subvocal   as in          Subvocal   as in --------   -----          --------   ----- b          babe              p       rap d          bad               t       at g          nag               k       book j          judge             ch      rich v          move              f       life th         with              th      Smith z          buzz              s       hiss z          azure(azh'ure)    sh      rush    REMARK.--These sixteen sounds make eight pairs of cognates. In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force without the utterance of any vocal sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.  The following subvocals and aspirates have no cognates.   SUBVOCALS.  Subvocal   as in      Subvocal   as in --------   -----      --------   ----- l          mill         r        rule m          rim          r        car n          run          w        win ng         sing         y        yet  ASPIRATES  Aspirate   as in --------   ----- h          hat wh         when    SUBSTITUTES.  Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented by other characters.  TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

DIRECTION.--Give to each sound, to each syllable, and to each word its full, distinct, and appropriate utterance.  For the purpose of avoiding the more common errors under this head, observe the following rules:  RULE II.--Avoid the omission of unaccented vowels.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect      Correct            Incorrect      Correct ---------      -----------        ----------     --------- Sep'rate       sep-a-rate         Ev'dent        ev-i-dent met-ric'l      met-ric-al         mem'ry         mem-o-ry 'pear          ap-pear            'pin-ion       o-pin-ion com-p'tent     com-pe-tent        pr'pose        pro-pose pr'cede        pre-cede           gran'lar       gran-u-lar 'spe-cial      es-pe-cial         par-tic'lar    par-tic-u-lar    RULE III.--Avoid sounding incorrectly the unaccented vowels.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect       Correct            Incorrect       Correct ----------      -----------        ------------    ------------ Sep-er-ate      sep-a-rate         Mem-er-ry       mem-o-ry met-ric-ul      met-ric-al         up-pin-ion      o-pin-ion up-pear         ap-pear            prup-ose        pro-pose com-per-tent    com-pe-tent        gran-ny-lar     gran-u-lar dum-mand        de-mand            par-tic-e-lar   par-tic-u-lar ob-stur-nate    ob-sti-nate        ev-er-dent      ev-i-dent   REMARK I.--In correcting errors of this kind in words of more than one syllable, it is very important to avoid a fault which is the natural consequence of an effort to articulate correctly. Thus, in endeavoring to sound correctly the a in met'ric-al, the pupil is very apt to say met-ric-al'. accenting the last syllable instead of the first.  REMARK 2.--The teacher should bear it in mind that in correcting a fault there is always danger of erring in the opposite extreme. Properly speaking, there is no danger of learning to articulate too distinctly, but there is danger of making the obscure sounds too prominent, and of reading in a slow, measured, and unnatural manner.  RULE IV.--Utter distinctly the terminating subvocals and aspirates.  EXAMPLES.  Incorrect     Correct      Incorrect     Correct ---------     -------      ---------     ------- An'           and          Mos'          mosque ban'          band         near-es'      near-est moun'         mound        wep'          wept mor-nin'      morn-ing     ob-jec'       ob-ject des'          desk         sub-jec       sub-ject   REMARK 1.--This omission is still more likely to occur when several consonants come together.   EXAMPLES.  Incorrect     Correct          Incorrect      Correct ---------     --------         ---------      ---------- Thrus'        thrusts          Harms'         harm'st beace         beasts           wrongs'        wrong'st thinks'       thinkst          twinkles'      twinkl'dst weps'         weptst           black'ns       black'n'dst   REMARK 2.--In all cases of this kind these sounds are omitted, in the first instance, merely because they are difficult, and require care and attention for their utterance, although after a while it becomes a habit. The only remedy is to devote that care and attention which may be necessary. There is no other difficulty, unless there should be a defect in the organs of speech, which is not often the case.  RULE V.--A void blending syllables which belong to different words.  EXAMPLES.  INCORRECT.            CORRECT. ----------            ------------ He ga-zdupon.         He gazed upon. Here res tsis sed.    Here rests his head. Whattis sis sname?    What is his name? For ranninstantush.   For an instant hush. Ther ris sa calm,     There is a calm. For tho stha tweep.
