(_Bells outside._)                    Oh, children, little children,                      Why do the joy-bells chime?  (_Singing heard outside.

And why is Christmas better                      Than many other days?         _Children_: Oh, don't you know the story                      Of the first Christmas time?                    Then listen, we will tell it,                      While the bells so sweetly chime.      _First child_: We count the years by hundreds                      Since that first Christmas day.                    When in a lowly manger                      The little Christ-child lay.     _Second child_: That night some shepherds tending                      Their flocks upon the hill,                    Heard heavenly voices singing,                      \"Peace, peace! On earth, good will.\"     _Third child_:  All bright as noon-tide splendor.                      A light about them shone,                    While louder sang the angels,                      \"A Saviour hath been born!\"     _Fourth child_: And then a sudden darkness--                      The voices died away,                    The wondering shepherds hurried                      To where the young Child lay.      _Fifth child_: Their flocks were all untended,                      While filled with love and awe,                    They bent above the manger                      And the Baby Jesus saw.      _Sixth child_: Then, too, the wise men watching                      Beheld a star that shone,                    In the blue heavens above them                      To tell that Christ was born.    _Seventh child_: And with their camels laden                      With spices and gold.                    They came from eastern countries                      The young King to behold.     _Eighth child_: The star still went before them,                      And pointing out the way,                    It shone upon the stable                      Where the Babe of Bethlehem lay      _Ninth child_: And then, all lowly bending,                      They worshipped the young King,                    And gave him from their treasures                      Full many an offering.    _Santa Claus, St. Nicholas, Kriss Kringle, etc.:_                    O children we have numbered                      Long centuries since then,                    But we see at every Christmas                      That little Child again.                    And we bring to all good children                      In memory of that time,                    Some pretty Christmas present,                      While the joy-bells gayly chime.    _1897_:          O children, little children,                      I soon must pass away,                    But 'tis good to have the memory                      Of this blessed Christmas day.    _Santa Claus and others_:                    We, too, must now be going.                      And as we march along,                    O let us sing together                      A happy Christmas song.  (_All march out singing. Tune \"Yankee Doodle.\"_)                     O the merry Christmas time                      Now is in the way, sir,                    Ev'ry sweet and happy chime                      Tells of Christmas day, sir.                     _Chorus._--                    Christmas it is coming, now,                      Don't you hear the bells, sir?

The fairies and brownies on last Christmas-tide   Decided to open their hearts very wide,   And spend extra time, throughout the whole year,   In helping their grandfather--Santa Claus dear.    \"Our fingers are nimble. We'll quickly make toys   Enough to supply all the girls and the boys,   And Santa may watch us to see if it's right,   So all will be ready before Christmas night.\"    Then bravely they all went to work with a will,   And soon all was quiet in workshop and mill;   For old Santa said, \"Enough, and well done,   We've toys enough now to make all kinds of fun.\"    We thank you, old Santa, and your helpers, too,   For all of the many kind things that you do;   And should you need more help in making your toys,   Just call on your small friends, the girls and the boys.          *       *       *       *       *  =Christmas Eve.=      (This must be spoken as if singing a lullaby to a baby, with     motions indicating the sleeping child near.)    Oh, hush thee, little dear, my soul,     The evening shades are falling;   Hush thee, my dear, dost thou not hear     The voice of the Master calling?    Deep lies the snow upon the earth,     But all the sky is ringing   With joyous song, and all night long     The stars shall dance with singing.    Oh, hush thee, little dear, my soul,     And close thine eyes in dreaming,   And angels fair shall lead thee where     The singing stars are beaming.    A shepherd calls his little lambs,     And he longeth to caress them;   He bids them rest upon his breast,     That his tender love may bless them.    So, hush thee, little dear, my soul,     Whilst evening shades are falling,   And above the song of the heavenly throng     Thou shall hear the Master calling.  --_Eugene Field._          *       *       *       *       *  =Santa Claus's Visit.=  By SUSIE M.

I want a horse and wagon,     And a boat that's painted red,   An elephant, a jumping-jack--     You need not bring a sled,    For I have one very pretty;     But I want a trotting-horse,   A man who wheels a wheel-barrow,     And candy, too, of course.    Now, Santa dear, you'll not forget.     I wish you'd write them down,   And leave them all at my house     When you journey through the town.          *       *       *       *       * =What I Should Like.=  By JENNIE D. MOORE.      (Recitation for a little girl.)    On Christmas eve I'd like to lie   Awake, when stars are in the sky,   And listen to the sound that swells   From Santa Claus's jingling bells.    I'd like to hear upon the roof   The patter of each tiny hoof   Of Santa's reindeer overhead,   When I am snug and warm in bed.    But mamma says I must not lie   Awake, or he will pass me by;   He does not like the girls or boys   To watch him when he brings the toys.    I think I'd better go to sleep.   I guess the presents all will keep,   Then in the morning I shall be   Glad to think I did not see.          *       *       *       *       *  =A Gentle Reminder.=    Something new about Christmas?

Christmas time for boys and girls       Is a happy day,     For we go to grandmamma's       And eat and sing and play.      Grandma does not say to us--       \"Stop that horrid noise,\"     'Cause she understands we can't,       When we're _\"only boys.\"_      And she lets the girls play house,       In the garret old,     And when they strew things around,       Grandma doesn't scold.      But we ought to pick them up,       Even on Christmas day,     For we shouldn't make kind friends       Trouble with our play.      Yes, we love the Christmas time       Best of all the year,     We have waited for it long,       Now, at last, it's here.          *       *       *       *       *  =Christmas Wishes.=  By C.

TO THE READER   Certain of the newspapers, when this book was first announced, made a mistake most natural upon seeing the sub-title as it then stood, A TALE OF SUNDRY ADVENTURES. “This sounds like a historical novel,” said one of them, meaning (I take it) a colonial romance. As it now stands, the title will scarce lead to such interpretation; yet none the less is this book historical--quite as much so as any colonial romance. Indeed, when you look at the root of the matter, it is a colonial romance. For Wyoming between 1874 and 1890 was a colony as wild as was Virginia one hundred years earlier. As wild, with a scantier population, and the same primitive joys and dangers. There were, to be sure, not so many Chippendale settees.  We know quite well the common understanding of the term “historical novel.” HUGH WYNNE exactly fits it. But SILAS LAPHAM is a novel as perfectly historical as is Hugh Wynne, for it pictures an era and personifies a type. It matters not that in the one we find George Washington and in the other none save imaginary figures; else THE SCARLET LETTER were not historical. Nor does it matter that Dr. Mitchell did not live in the time of which he wrote, while Mr. Howells saw many Silas Laphams with his own eyes; else UNCLE TOM'S CABIN were not historical. Any narrative which presents faithfully a day and a generation is of necessity historical; and this one presents Wyoming between 1874 and 1890. Had you left New York or San Francisco at ten o'clock this morning, by noon the day after to-morrow you could step out at Cheyenne. There you would stand at the heart of the world that is the subject of my picture, yet you would look around you in vain for the reality. It is a vanished world. No journeys, save those which memory can take, will bring you to it now. The mountains are there, far and shining, and the sunlight, and the infinite earth, and the air that seems forever the true fountain of youth, but where is the buffalo, and the wild antelope, and where the horseman with his pasturing thousands? So like its old self does the sage-brush seem when revisited, that you wait for the horseman to appear.  But he will never come again. He rides in his historic yesterday. You will no more see him gallop out of the unchanging silence than you will see Columbus on the unchanging sea come sailing from Palos with his caravels.  And yet the horseman is still so near our day that in some chapters of this book, which were published separate at the close of the nineteenth century, the present tense was used. It is true no longer. In those chapters it has been changed, and verbs like “is” and “have” now read “was” and “had.” Time has flowed faster than my ink.  What is become of the horseman, the cow-puncher, the last romantic figure upon our soil? For he was romantic. Whatever he did, he did with his might. The bread that he earned was earned hard, the wages that he squandered were squandered hard,--half a year's pay sometimes gone in a night,--“blown in,” as he expressed it, or “blowed in,” to be perfectly accurate. Well, he will be here among us always, invisible, waiting his chance to live and play as he would like. His wild kind has been among us always, since the beginning: a young man with his temptations, a hero without wings.  The cow-puncher's ungoverned hours did not unman him. If he gave his word, he kept it; Wall Street would have found him behind the times. Nor did he talk lewdly to women; Newport would have thought him old-fashioned. He and his brief epoch make a complete picture, for in themselves they were as complete as the pioneers of the land or the explorers of the sea. A transition has followed the horseman of the plains; a shapeless state, a condition of men and manners as unlovely as is that moment in the year when winter is gone and spring not come, and the face of Nature is ugly. I shall not dwell upon it here. Those who have seen it know well what I mean. Such transition was inevitable. Let us give thanks that it is but a transition, and not a finality.  Sometimes readers inquire, Did I know the Virginian? As well, I hope, as a father should know his son. And sometimes it is asked, Was such and such a thing true? Now to this I have the best answer in the world. Once a cow-puncher listened patiently while I read him a manuscript. It concerned an event upon an Indian reservation. “Was that the Crow reservation?” he inquired at the finish. I told him that it was no real reservation and no real event; and his face expressed displeasure. “Why,” he demanded, “do you waste your time writing what never happened, when you know so many things that did happen?”  And I could no more help telling him that this was the highest compliment ever paid me than I have been able to help telling you about it here!  CHARLESTON, S.C., March 31st, 1902     THE VIRGINIAN     I. ENTER THE MAN   Some notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to the window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was. I saw near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and inside it some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging, huddling, and dodging. They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them would not be caught, no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty of time to watch this sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might take water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform of Medicine Bow. We were also six hours late, and starving for entertainment. The pony in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet, incessant eye? Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took the rope. The man might pretend to look at the weather, which was fine; or he might affect earnest conversation with a bystander: it was bootless. The pony saw through it. No feint hoodwinked him. This animal was thoroughly a man of the world. His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissembling foe, and the gravity of his horse-expression made the matter one of high comedy. Then the rope would sail out at him, but he was already elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gayety must have abounded in that corral. Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had slid in a flash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a school of playful fish whipped round the corral, kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it) roaring with laughter. Through the window-glass of our Pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs reached us, and the strong, humorous curses of the cow-boys. Then for the first time I noticed a man who sat on the high gate of the corral, looking on. For he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin. The others had all visibly whirled the rope, some of them even shoulder high. I did not see his arm lift or move. He appeared to hold the rope down low, by his leg. But like a sudden snake I saw the noose go out its length and fall true; and the thing was done. As the captured pony walked in with a sweet, church-door expression, our train moved slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked, “That man knows his business.”  But the passenger's dissertation upon roping I was obliged to lose, for Medicine Bow was my station. I bade my fellow-travellers good-by, and descended, a stranger, into the great cattle land. And here in less than ten minutes I learned news which made me feel a stranger indeed.  My baggage was lost; it had not come on my train; it was adrift somewhere back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me. And by way of comfort, the baggage-man remarked that passengers often got astray from their trunks, but the trunks mostly found them after a while. Having offered me this encouragement, he turned whistling to his affairs and left me planted in the baggage-room at Medicine Bow. I stood deserted among crates and boxes, blankly holding my check, hungry and forlorn. I stared out through the door at the sky and the plains; but I did not see the antelope shining among the sage-brush, nor the great sunset light of Wyoming. Annoyance blinded my eyes to all things save my grievance: I saw only a lost trunk. And I was muttering half-aloud, “What a forsaken hole this is!” when suddenly from outside on the platform came a slow voice: “Off to get married AGAIN? Oh, don't!”  The voice was Southern and gentle and drawling; and a second voice came in immediate answer, cracked and querulous. “It ain't again. Who says it's again? Who told you, anyway?”  And the first voice responded caressingly: “Why, your Sunday clothes told me, Uncle Hughey. They are speakin' mighty loud o' nuptials.”  “You don't worry me!” snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.  And the other gently continued, “Ain't them gloves the same yu' wore to your last weddin'?”  “You don't worry me! You don't worry me!” now screamed Uncle Hughey.  Already I had forgotten my trunk; care had left me; I was aware of the sunset, and had no desire but for more of this conversation. For it resembled none that I had heard in my life so far. I stepped to the door and looked out upon the station platform.  Lounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant, more beautiful than pictures. His broad, soft hat was pushed back; a loose-knotted, dull-scarlet handkerchief sagged from his throat; and one casual thumb was hooked in the cartridge-belt that slanted across his hips. He had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast horizon, as the dust upon him showed. His boots were white with it. His overalls were gray with it. The weather-beaten bloom of his face shone through"]]]
