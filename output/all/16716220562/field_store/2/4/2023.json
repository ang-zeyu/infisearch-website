In that case, you would, by all means, show good judgment consulting a younger officer.  But remember, Darrin, that not all men are equally wise.  Be very careful whom you select at any time as adviser.  And remember that, for any advice that you may properly ask of me, you may come to me without hesitation.\"  \"Thank you, sir.  I trust you realize how deeply grateful I am to you,\" Dave protested earnestly.  As other officers came up, Commander Bainbridge cut the discussion short by turning to greet the arrivals.  Dinner in the ward-room was the formal meal of the day.  The table, covered with snowy damask, glittered with crystal and silver. Silent, soft-moving little Filipinos, in their white mess suits, glided about, serving noiselessly.  At the head of the table sat Commander Bainbridge, the executive officer, for the captain of a battleship dines in solitary state in his own apartments.  On either side of the executive officer sat the other officers, in two long rows, according to their rank. On either side of the Commander were seated the officers with rank of lieutenant commander.  Next to them were the lieutenants, senior grade.  After them came the lieutenants, junior grade. At the foot of the table was a group of ensigns, the lowest in rank of commissioned officers of the Navy.  Course followed course, and good humor prevailed at the officers' table.  Now and then a good joke or a witty sally called forth hearty laughter.  Here and there officers, dismissing laughter for the time being, talked of graver matters.  Danny Grin soon found time to murmur the question:  \"How did you get along with your tyrant this afternoon?\"  \"No better,\" Dave answered, moodily.  \"Did he rake you over the coals again?\"  \"Yes.\" Then Darrin detailed the circumstances.  \"I am afraid he has it in for you, all right,\" muttered Danny Grin, scowling.  \"He'll report me as often as he can, I don't doubt,\" Dave replied. \"If he can bring me up before a general court-martial, all the better.\"  \"I'm sorry you're not in Trent's division,\" Dan sighed.  \"He's a gentleman---a regular, sea-going officer.\"  \"Sea-going\" is the highest praise that can be given in Navy circles.  \"If I were in Trent's division, probably you'd have fallen under Cantor,\" Darrin suggested.  \"That would have been all right,\" nodded Dalzell, cheerily.  \"Cantor has no direct cause to hate me, as he has in your case.  Besides, I'd do a good many things to a mean superior that you wouldn't. If I had to stand watch with Cantor, and he tried any queer treatment of me, I'd find a way to make his life miserable.  I believe I've shown some skill in that line in the past.\"  \"You surely have,\" Darrin nodded.  \"But I don't like to spring traps for my superior officers to fall into.\"  \"Not even in self-defence?\" challenged Dalzell.  \"Not even to save myself,\" Darrin declared.  At eight bells, in Lieutenant Cantor's absence, Darrin took the watch trick alone as officer of the deck until six bells, or eleven o'clock that night.  There was not much to do.  Now and then a shore leave man, sailor or marine, reported coming on board.  Darrin made a note of the man's return and entered the time.  Twice, a messenger brought some small order from the executive officer.  Yet it was a dull watch, with the ship docked and nothing of importance happening.  \"Cantor will soon be back,\" thought Dave, at last, slipping out his watch and glancing at it under the light that came from the cabin.  His timepiece showed the time to be five minutes to eleven.  But a quarter of an hour passed, and no Lieutenant Cantor appeared. More time slipped by without the lieutenant's return.  \"That doesn't sound much like the punctuality that is required of a naval officer,\" Dave told himself, in some disquiet.  Then finally a step was heard on the gangplank.  Lieutenant Cantor came briskly up over the side, halting on the deck and saluting toward the stern, where the colors flew until sundown.  \"Mr. Darrin, I've come on board,\" reported the lieutenant, turning in time to catch Dave's salute.  He stepped closer, to add:  \"You will enter a note that I came on board at 10.58.\"  \"The time is eleven-forty, sir,\" Dave reminded his superior, at the same time displaying his watch.  \"Note that I came on board at 10.58,\" insisted Cantor, frowning.  \"Sentry!\" called Dave, briskly.  \"Aye, aye, sir!\"  \"Note the time on the chronometer inside,\" Darrin ordered.  \"Aye, aye, sir.\" Then, returning the marine sentry answered:  \"It's eleven-forty, sir.\"  Dave made the entry of the lieutenant's return.  \"You infernal trouble-maker,\" hissed Cantor, as the sentry paced on.  \"You dragged that sentry into it, just so you would have supporting testimony of the time I came aboard!  I'll pay you back for that!  Look out for trouble, Mr. Darrin!\"     CHAPTER IV  THE WARD-ROOM HEARS REAL NEWS   Hurrying to the now empty office of the executive officer, Cantor made correct entry of his return to ship on the record, then hurried to his own quarters, and with almost the speed of magic, slipped into his undress uniform, belted on his sword, and appeared smartly on the quarter-deck.  For two minutes he paid no heed to Darrin, save to return the salute with which the young ensign greeted his superior's return to command of the deck.  Presently, however, Lieutenant Cantor stepped over to say in an undertone:  \"Darrin, you have made the wrong start, and I see that you are bound to keep it up.\"  \"I am trying to do my duty, sir,\" Darrin returned.  \"I could not consent to make a false official return.\"  \"Officers often have to do that for each other,\" Cantor went on, in the same low tone, \"and they do it willingly as between comrades.\"  It was on the tip of Darrin tongue to retort that he didn't believe any true officer, being a man of honor, could stoop to making a false official report.  Yet he instantly thought better of it, and forced back the sarcastic retort that rose to his lips.  \"You're not going to succeed in the Navy, sir,\" Cantor continued, then, seeing the young ensign's face still impassive, he added, with a malicious leer:  \"Since you are determined to make an enemy of me, Darrin, I shall do my best to see to it that you have short shrift in the service.\"  \"Of that I haven't a doubt,\" Dave returned, but he caught himself in time and said it under his breath.  Then came the changing of the watch.  Trent and Dalzell appeared and went on duty.  Formally, Dave wished his division commander good night, Cantor answering only with a grunt.  Returning to his stateroom, Dave threw off belt and sword, hung up his cap, then sat down in his desk chair, leaning back and steadily regarding the breech of the great gun.  \"I wonder if any other young officer in the service is at the mercy of such a brute,\" Darrin asked himself, wretchedly.  \"I love good discipline, but there's one thing wrong with the service, and that is, the ease with which a dishonorable officer can render the life of his subordinate miserable.  It ought not to be possible, and yet I don't see any way of preventing it.  I wish I could talk with a gentleman like Lieutenant Trent, but he would only regard me as a tale-bearer, and after that he would have no use for me.  One thing I can see clearly.  Cantor is likely to have me broken and kicked out of the service if I am forced to remain in his division week after week.\"  Then, realizing that his time was slipping away, Darrin hastily undressed and got into his berth.  It was a long time, though, before sleep came to him.  In the morning Lieutenant Cantor was obliged to listen meekly to a long discourse by the executive officer on the virtue of punctuality in a naval officer.  The offender told of a car block in New York that had made it impossible for him to return on time.  \"Lieutenant Cantor,\" returned the executive officer, dryly, \"a careful officer will allow himself sufficient margin of time to make it morally certain that he can be back to his duty on time. Now, sir-----\"  But at this moment an apprentice messenger, standing in the doorway, his right hand drawn up in salute, attracted the gaze of Commander Bainbridge:  \"The captain\" compliments, sir; will the executive officer report to him at once.\"  \"That is all---for the present---Lieutenant Cantor,\" said Commander Bainbridge, rising from his chair and hastening out.  \"And all this, on account of a puppy of a junior who will not use sense and reason at the request of a superior officer!\" ground Cantor between his teeth.  \"I shall pay Darrin for this, and for that greater insult, too.\"  Some minutes before the call to breakfast was due, Darrin and Dalzell appeared from their quarters and walked aft to where a group of the \"_Long Island's_\" officers stood.  Three or four of them had newspapers in their hands.  \"It's time the government did something!\" exclaimed one lieutenant commander, testily.  \"We're going to do something, soon,\" asserted another officer, with a snap of his jaws.  \"When?\" demanded a third officer, while several men laughed derisively.  \"We'll have to,\" continued the second speaker.  \"Every day the Mexican situation becomes worse.  The usurper, Huerta, is becoming more of a menace all the time.  He has no regard for the rights of any one, but himself.  And he is unable to do more, in the field, than to accept defeat after defeat at the hands of the rebels under that former bandit chief, 'Pancho' Villa.  Both the so-called Federals and the rebels, in Mexico, are doing their best to make Mexico a hotbed of incurable anarchy.  Scores of American citizens have been murdered ruthlessly, and American women have been roughly treated.  British subjects have been shot without the shadow of an excuse, and other foreigners have been maltreated.  This country claims to uphold the Monroe Doctrine, which prevents European nations from interfering with force in affairs on this continent.  If that is the case, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12776"],["title","Dave Darrin at Vera Cruz: Fighting with the U.S. Navy in Mexico (#6)"],["body","the United States must put an end to the numberless outrages against Americans and Europeans that take place every week in Mexico.  That once orderly republic, Mexico, is now nothing better than a school for instruction in wholesale murder and in the ruthless riding over of the rights of all aliens residing or traveling in that country.  These aliens have every right to protection.\"  \"Quite true,\" remarked another officer.  \"But what has that to do with the United States?  What has there been in our conduct during the past three or four years to indicate that we would take any strong-handed action to make life and property safe in Mexico?\"  \"We shall soon interfere,\" predicted the former speaker, confidently. \"Affairs in Mexico are now nearing a crisis.  The United States will no longer be called a civilized and honorable nation if Army and Navy men are not sent to Mexico to uphold our government and the rights of American citizens living there.\"  \"Do you think, Holton, that will happen before you and I have been put on the retired list as white-haired rear admirals?\" asked another officer, half-jeeringly.  \"You will find,\" insisted Lieutenant Holton, \"that we shall soon be listening to the thunder of our American naval guns at Vera Cruz, Tampico, or some other port on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.\"  \"Hurrah!\" came from the throats of a dozen officers, but the cheer was not a very confident one.  Too long had the United States been patient in the face of one insult or injury after another. General Huerta, in Mexico City, and Carranza and Villa, in the west and north of that country, had headed factions, neither of which seemed to care about Mexico's good name in the world at large.  Maltreated Americans demanded punishment of the Mexican offenders, but the United States had been engaged in patiently waiting and watching, only once in a while sending a feeble protest either to the Federal or the Constitutionalist leaders in that murder-ridden country of Mexico.  Mess-call sounded to breakfast.  The officers filed into their places at table; then, on observing that the executive officer was not in his place at the head of the table, they remained standing by their chairs.  A minute afterward Commander Bainbridge entered with brisk stride, going to his place and giving the seating signal as he said:  \"Pardon my tardiness, gentlemen; the captain detained me on a most urgent matter.\"  After that the buzz of conversation broke loose.  Breakfast orders were taken by the white-coated, noiseless Filipino servants.  When all had been served, the executive officer glanced up, then rose.  \"The attendants will withdraw,\" he ordered.  \"Orderly!\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" responded the marine orderly on post just inside the door.  \"As soon as the attendants have gone outside, orderly, you will chose the door from the outside, and remain there to keep any one from entering the room.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" responded the orderly, who then followed the last attendant outside, closing the door after him.  \"Gentlemen,\" continued the executive officer, remaining standing, \"Captain Gales sent for me this morning, to make a most important communication.  With his approval I am going to tell you something of what he said.  In a word, then, this ship is ordered to be fitted for a cruise to Mexico in the shortest time possible. Within three or four days we must be on our way to Mexican waters.  \"We are to go with bunkers filled with coal.  We are to carry abundant clothing supplies for tropical service.  We are to carry all the large and small arms ammunition that we can stow away. We are to take on food supplies to our fullest commissary capacity. In a word, we are to go prepared for any emergency.  \"Now, gentlemen, on account of our departure at the earliest moment, every officer will be needed on board all the time.  Unless for some extraordinary reason, shore leave will not be granted to any officer.  The watch-word will be 'hustle.' Thank you, gentlemen, for your attention.\"  In an instant there was clamor in the wardroom.  Twenty officers spoke at once, then subsided.  Finally only the voice of Lieutenant Commander Denton was heard as he inquired:  \"Sir, are we entitled to ask any questions?\"  \"I will answer any questions that I may properly,\" smiled the executive officer.  \"We are going to Mexico, sir, in fighting trim, are we not?\"  \"I think what I have already said will indicate that,\" came Commander Bainbridge's reply.  \"Has anything happened in Mexico,\" continued Denton, \"which makes it imperative for us to fight there?\"  \"Nothing, so far as I know,\" answered the executive officer, \"other than the usual daily outrages that are disgracing the fair name of Mexico.\"  \"Then nothing of unusual importance has happened, which would make us sure that we are heading for Mexico on a definite fighting errand?\"  \"I have no knowledge that we are actually going to fight in Mexico,\" replied Commander Bainbridge.  \"It has occurred to me that this ship, and others of the line, are being ordered to Mexico as a hint to Federals and rebels alike that the United States possesses force enough to bring all Mexicans to their senses.\"  Having made this last reply, Commander Bainbridge touched a button. The ward-room door was thrown open, and the mess-servants once more entered.  But now a new note crept into the talk.  The fact that the \"_Long Island_\" was to carry to Mexican waters full supplies of all kinds, including small and large ammunition, was enough to satisfy these officers of the Navy that the government at Washington had an important move on hand, and that move was expected to bring about armed conflict between the two countries.  \"Now, am I a dreamer?\" demanded Lieutenant Holton of those about him.  The two most excited officers present were also the newest on hoard the \"_Long Island_.\"  At the thought of active service against an enemy, Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell fairly tingled.  \"This is the greatest news we could possibly get,\" beamed Danny Grin, turning to his chum.  \"It seems too great to be true,\" replied Ensign Darrin.  \"Danny, the Mexicans have been boasting that we don't _dare_ tackle them and stir up that Mexican hornet's nest.  If we get a chance, the American Navy will show them---and the world---something well worth remembering!\"  Both Darrin and Dalzell had already been notified that they were detailed to \"day duty\" for that day.  This meant that they would have no watch duty to stand, but would be employed through the day, while watch duty fell to the lot of others.  While Dalzell was to go below, with Trent, aiding in the storage of shells in the magazine, Darrin was ordered to report to Lieutenant Cantor to supervise the oiling of mechanisms of the guns of Cantor's division, and, later, to perform other important duties.  \"Your face is flushed,\" sneered Cantor, when he found an opportunity to speak aside with Dave.  \"You are dreaming of active service in war, perhaps.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Dave, simply.  \"Look out that war service doesn't bring you disgrace, instead of honor or glory,\" warned Cantor, darkly.  \"What do you mean, sir?\"  \"You have made me your enemy, and I am a good hater,\" retorted Lieutenant Cantor.  \"You will be under my orders, and I may find a chance-----\"  Lieutenant Cantor finished only with an expressive shrug of his shoulders.  Though Dave Darrin felt a tremor of uneasiness, his eyes flashed back honest indignation and contempt for so unworthy a superior officer.     CHAPTER V  WATCHING AND WAITING---BEHIND BIG GUNS   April, in the tropics!  Four miles off the coast of Mexico, east of the historic port of Vera Cruz, the United States dreadnought, \"_Long Island_,\" moved along at slow cruising speed.  The few days out from New York had brought marked changes in climate. While people in New York found the weather still cold, here in Mexican waters, officers and men alike were in the white uniforms of the tropics---all save those whose work below compelled them to wear dungarees.  On the bridge forward, two officers paced at a time.  During the night hours there were always three there.  Aft, on the quarter-deck, marines were going through the rifle gymnastic drill.  In some of the divisions officers and men were busy at the big gun drills.  Others were cleaning a ship that always seemed spotless.  The few that were off duty gathered wherever they could find room, for a battleship at sea, with her full complement of officers and men on board, is a crowded affair.  No other ship of the American fleet was in sight, but two operators, constantly on duty in the wireless room, kept the \"_Long Island_\" in constant touch with a score of vessels of the United States Navy.  \"Have you any idea what we're doing here?\" asked Danny Grin, as he and Dave met on the superstructure.  \"No idea whatever,\" Ensign Darrin admitted.  \"I have noticed, though, that the officers on the bridge keep a constant lookout ashore.  See; two of them, even now, have their binoculars trained on the shore.\"  \"I don't see anything over there,\" replied Dalzell, \"except a house or a small village here and there.  I looked through the binoculars a little while ago, and to me it appeared a country that was about nine-tenths swamp.\"  \"In the event of sending landing parties ashore,\" Dave hinted, \"we might have to fight in one of those swamps.  When it comes to fighting in the tangles and mazes of a swamp, I fancy the Mexicans have had a whole lot more experience than we have had.\"  \"Why should we have to send landing parties so far from Vera Cruz?\" Dan demanded, opening his eyes.  \"We're only forty or fifty miles east of Vera Cruz,\" Darrin went on.  \"Danny boy, Vera Cruz is supposed to have a garrison, at present, of only about eight hundred of General Huerta's Mexican Federals.  But suppose it was rumored that the Americans intended to land at Vera Cruz.  Isn't it likely that the garrison would be greatly increased?\"  \"Let 'em increase their old"]]]
