His peremptory requests were generally preferred in writing, addressed \"For the Lusty Knight, Sir Slosson Thompson, Office,\" and delivered by his grinning minion, the office factotum. Sometimes they were in verse, as in the following:    _\"Who spilt my bottle of ink?\" said Field,     \"Who spilt my bottle of ink?\"   And then with a sigh, said Thompson, \"'Twas I--     I broke that bottle of ink,         I think,     And wasted the beautiful ink.\"    \"Who'll buy a bottle of ink?\" asked Field,     \"Who'll buy a bottle of ink?\"   With a still deeper sigh his friend replied, \"I--     I'll buy a bottle of ink         With chink,     I'll buy a bottle of ink!\"    \"Oh, isn't this beautiful ink!\" cried Field,     \"Beautiful bilious ink!\"   He shook the hand of his old friend, and     He tipped him a pleasant wink,         And a blink,     As he went to using that ink._  While Field insisted on a variegated assortment of inks he did not demand a separate pen for each color. In lieu of these he possessed himself of an old linen office coat, which he donned when it was cool enough for a coat and used for a pen-wiper. When the temperature rendered anything beyond shirt-sleeves superfluous, this linen affair was hung so conveniently that he could still use it for what he regarded as its primary use. In warm weather I wore a presentably clean counterpart of Field's Joseph's coat of many colors. As often as necessary this went to the laundry. One day when it had just returned from one of these periodical visits, I was startled, but not surprised, to find that Field had appropriated my spotless linen duster to his own inky uses and left his own impossible creation hanging on my hook in its stead. Field's version of what then occurred is beautifully, if not truthfully, portrayed in the accompanying \"Proper Sonet\" and life-like portraits.  If the reader will imagine each mark on the coat, of which \"Nompy\" bootlessly complains, done in different colors, he will have some idea of the infinite pains Field bestowed on the details of his epistolary pranks.  Out of the remarkable series of postal appeals which Field sent to me when I was visiting in New Brunswick grew an animated correspondence between Field and my youngest sister. She bore the good old-fashioned Christian names of Mary Matilda--a combination that struck a responsive chord in Field's taste in nomenclature, while his \"come at once, we are starving\" aroused her sense of humor to the point of forwarding an enormous raised biscuit two thousand miles for the relief of two Chicago sufferers. The result was an exchange of letters, one of which has a direct bearing on his whimsical adoption of many-colored inks in his writing. It read as follows:  [Illustration: A PROPER SONET. _From a drawing in colors by Eugene Field._    Then Kriee 3 times his breast he smote,     And gruesome oaths swore he;   \"Oh, bring back _mine_, and take _your_ coat--     Your painted coat, the which I note       Full ill besemmeth me!\"   But swere and plede he as he mote,   Old Field said \"No, ol' Nompy, no!   You'll get your coat not none no mo!\"]  [Illustration: FIELD AND BALLANTYNE AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF A BISCUIT FROM NEW BRUNSWICK. _From a drawing by Eugene Field._]    [red ink] CHICAGO, May the 7th, 1885.    [blue ink] Dear Miss:    I make bold to send herewith a diagram of the new rooms in which your   brother Slason is now [brown ink] ensconced. The drawing may be bad   and the perspective may be out of plumb, but the motif is good, as   you [green ink] will allow. All that Brother Slason needs now to   symmetrize his new abode is a box from home--a box filled [purple   ink] with those toothsome goodies which only a kind, loving,   indulgent sister can make and donate to an absent [black ink]   brother. Having completed my contribution to the Larned gallery, and   having exhibited the pictures in the [red ink] recent salon, I have a   large supply of colored inks on hand, which fact accounts for that   appearance of an [blue ink] Easter necktie or a crazy quilt which   this note has. In a few days I shall take the liberty of sending   [brown ink] you the third volume of the \"Aunt Mary Matilda\" series--a   tale of unusual power and interest. With [green ink] many reverential   obeisances and respectful assurances of regard, I beg to remain,    [lilac ink]   Your obedient servant,   [purple ink]      EUGENE FIELD,   [red ink]              per   [blue ink]        William Smith,   [brown ink]         Secretary.  This epistle did indeed look like a crazy quilt. There was a change of color at the beginning of each line, as I have endeavored to indicate. It is beautifully written and in many respects besides its variegated aspect is the most perfect specimen of Field's painstaking epistolary handiwork I know of.  The \"diagram of Mr. Slason Thompson's New Rooms\" accompanying this letter was entirely worthy of it, and must have afforded him hours of boyish pleasure. No description can do it justice. He gave a ground plan of two square rooms with the windows marked in red ink, the doors in green, the bed, with a little figure on it, in blue, the fireplace in yellow, chairs and tables in purple, and the \"buttery,\" as he insisted on calling the bathroom, in brown. As these apartments were in the Pullman Building, on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Adams Street, and commanded a glimpse of the lake, Field's diagram included a representation of Lake Michigan by zigzag lines of blue ink, with a single fish as long as a street-car, according to his scale, leering at the spectator from the billowy depths of indigo blue. Everything in the diagram was carefully identified in the key which accompanied it. An idea of the infinite attention to detail Field bestowed on such frivoling as this may be gathered from the accompanying cut of the Pullman Building, from the seventh story of which I am shown waving a welcome to the good but \"impecunious knight.\" The inscription, in Field's handwriting, tells the story.  [Illustration: THE GOOD KNIGHT SLOSSON'S CASTLE. _From a drawing by Eugene Field._    The good knight Slosson from a watch tower of his castle desenith and   salutith the good Knight Eugene, sans peur et sans monie.]  [Illustration: A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS. _From drawings by Eugene Field._    No. 1   The fair Mary Matilda skimming over the hills and dales of New   Brunswick.

An inkling as to the meaning of these weird pictures may be gleaned from the letter I sent along with them to my sister, in which I wrote:    I was telling Field the story of your last snow-shoeing party when he   was prompted to the enclosed tragedy in five acts. He hopes that you   will not mistake the stars for mosquitoes, nor fail to comprehend the   terrible fate that has overtaken Eddy Martin at the mouth of the   voracious musquash, whose retreating tail speaks so eloquently of his   toothsome repast. The lone pine tree is a thing that you will enjoy;   also the expression of horror on your own face when you behold the   empty boots of Eddy. There is a tragedy too deep for tears in the   silent monuments of Field's ignorance of moccasins.  In explanation of the final scene in this \"sad, eventful history\" it should be said that \"poor Eddie\" was a harmless, half-witted giant who sawed the cord wood and did odd chores about my father's place. This gives significance to the pendant buck-saw and the lonely wood-horse. His lance rusts upon the wall and his steed stands silent in the stall. The reader should not pass from these examples of Field's humor with pen and ink without marking the changes that come across the face of the moon as the tragedy unfolds.  That Field found a congenial spirit and correspondent in my sister is further evidenced in the following letter written in gamboge brown:    CHICAGO, July the 2d, 1885.    DEAR MISS:    In order that you may no longer groan under the erroneous impression   which you appear to harbor, touching my physique, I remit to you a   photograph of a majority of myself. The photograph was made last   December, when I was, so to speak, at my perihelion in the matter of   avoirdupois. You may be gratified to know that I have not shrunken   much since that time. I have taken the timely precaution to label the   picture in order that none of your Fredericton people thumbing over   your domestic album shall mistake me for either a young Episcopal   rector or a rising young negro minstrel.    The several drawings and paintings I have sent you ever and anon at   your brother's expense are really not the best samples of my art.

It might be just as well not to read this line to   the old folks. Your brother Slosson has recently developed an   insatiate passion for horse racing, and in consequence of his losses   at pools I find him less prone to regale me with sumptuous cheer than   he was before the racing season broke out. The prince, too, has   blossomed out as a patron of the track, and I am slowly becoming more   and more aware that this is a bitter world. I think I may safely say   that I look wholly to such noble, generous young women as you and   your sisters to preserve in me a consciousness that there is in life   such a boon as generosity.    You will observe (if you have any eye for color) that I pen you these   lines in gamboge brown; this is because Fourth of July is so near at   hand.

Will you please slap Bessie for me--the pert minx! I heard of her   remarks about my story of Mary Matilda and the Prince.    Believe me as ever,    Sincerely yours,    EUGENE FIELD.  The story of \"How Mary Matilda Won a Prince\" was the third in what Field called his \"Aunt Mary Matilda Series.\" The first of these was \"The Lonesome Little Shoe\" (see \"The Holy Cross and Other Tales\" of his collected works), which, after it was printed in the Morning News, was cut out and pasted in a little brown manila pamphlet, with marginal illustrations of the most fantastic nature. The title page of this precious specimen of Fieldiana is characteristic:    THE LONESOME LITTLE SHOE:    BEING A WONDERFUL NARRATIVE CULLED FROM   THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF EUGENE FIELD    1885.    PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED    DEDICATED TO AUNT MARY MATILDA'S PRESENT   AND FUTURE NEPHEWS AND NIECES,   THEIR HEIRS, ASSIGNS AND ASSIGNEES   FOREVER    CANADIAN TRACT SOCIETY    (COPYRIGHT)  What became of the second of this wonderful series no one knows. The third, \"How Mary Won a Prince,\" is the only instance that has come under my notice where Field put any of his compositions in typewriter. This was done to make the first edition consist of a single copy. The prince and hero of this romantic tale was our associate, John F. Ballantyne, and the story itself was \"Inscribed to the beautiful, accomplished, amiable and ever-to-be-revered, Miss Mary Matilda Thompson, of Frederickton, York County, New Brunswick, Dominion of Canada, 1885.\" It was said to be \"elegantly illustrated,\" of which the reader may judge from the accompanying reproductions.    HOW MARY MATILDA WON A PRINCE.    A gypsy had told Mary Matilda that she would marry a prince. This was   when Mary Matilda was a little girl. She had given the gypsy a nice,   fresh bun, and the gypsy was so grateful that she said she would tell   the little girl's fortune, so Mary Matilda held out her hand and the   old gypsy looked at it very closely.    \"You are very generous,\" said the gypsy, \"and your generosity will   cause a prince to fall in love with you; the prince will rescue you   from a great danger and you will wed the prince.\"    Having uttered these strange words, the gypsy went away and shortly   after was sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary for having   robbed a hen-roost.    Mary Matilda grew from childhood to be the most beautiful maiden in   all the province; none was so beautiful and so witty as she. Withal   she was so amiable and benevolent that all loved her, even those who   envied her the transcendent charms with which she was endowed. As the   unfortunate gypsy had predicted, Mary Matilda was the most generous   maiden on earth and the fame of her goodness was wide-spread.    Now Mary Matilda had an older brother who had gone to a far-off   country to become rich, and to accomplish those great political   reforms to which his ambition inclined him. His name was Slosson, and   in the far-off country he fell in with two young men of his own age   who were of similar ambition. But they were even poorer than Slosson,   and what particularly grieved them was the fact that their lineage   was obscured by dark clouds of doubt. That is to say, they were   unable to determine with any degree of positiveness whether they were   of noble extraction; their parents refused to inform them, and   consequently they were deeply distressed, as you can well imagine.   Slosson was much charmed with their handsome bearing, chivalric ways,   and honorable aspirations, and his pity was evoked by their poverty   and their frequent sufferings for the very requirements of life.   Freely he shared his little all with them, in return for which they   gave him their gratitude and affection. One day Slosson wrote a   letter to his sister Mary Matilda, saying: \"A hard winter is coming   on and our store of provisions is nearly exhausted. My two friends   are in much distress and so am I. We have accomplished a political   revolution, but under the civil service laws we can hardly expect an   office.\"    Mary Matilda was profoundly touched by this letter. Her tender heart   bled whenever she thought of her absent brother, and instinctively   her sympathies went out toward his two companions in distress. So in   her own quiet, maidenly way she set about devising a means for the   relief of the unfortunate young men. She made a cake, a beautiful   cake stuffed with plums and ornamented with a lovely design   representing the lost Pleiad, which you perhaps know was a young lady   who lived long ago and acquired eternal fame by dropping out of the   procession and never getting back again. Well, Mary Matilda put this   delicious cake in a beautiful paper collar-box and sent it in all   haste to her brother and his two friends in the far-off country.   Great was Slosson's joy upon receiving this palatable boon, and great   was the joy of his two friends, who it must be confessed were on the   very brink of starvation. The messages Mary Matilda received from the   grateful young men, who owed their rescue to her, must have pleased   her, although the consciousness of a noble deed is better than words   of praise.    But one day Mary Matilda got another letter from her brother Slosson   which plunged her into profound melancholy. \"Weep with me, dear   Sister,\" he wrote, \"for one of my companions, Juan, has left me. He   was the youngest, and I fear some great misfortune has befallen him,   for he was ever brooding over the mystery of his lineage. Yesterday   he left us and we have not seen him since. He took my lavender   trousers with him.\"    As you may easily suppose, Mary Matilda was much cast down by this   fell intelligence. She drooped like a blighted lily and wept.    \"What can ail our Mary Matilda?\" queried her mother. \"The roses have   vanished from her cheeks, the fire has gone out of her orbs, and her   step has lost its old-time cunning. I am much worried about her.\"    They all noticed her changed appearance. Even Eddie Martin, the   herculean wood-sawyer, observed the dejection with which the   sorrow-stricken maiden emerged from the house and handed him his   noontide rations of nutcakes and buttermilk. But Mary Matilda spoke   of the causes of her woe to none of them. In silence she brooded over   the mystery of Juan's disappearance.  [Illustration: THE PRINCE ASKING EDDIE MARTIN ABOUT THE FAIR MARY MATILD.]    When the winter came and the soft, fair snow lay ten or twelve feet   deep on the level on the forest and stream, on wold and woodland,   little Bessie once asked Mary Matilda if she would not take her out   for a walk. Now little Bessie was Mary Matilda's niece, and she was   such a sweet little girl that Mary Matilda could never say \"no\" to   anything she asked.    \"Yes, Bessie,\" said Mary Matilda, \"if you will bundle up nice and warm   I will take you out for a short walk of twenty or thirty miles.\"    So Bessie bundled up nice and warm. Then Mary Matilda went out on the   porch and launched her two snow-shoes and got into them and harnessed   them to her tiny feet.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Eddie Martin, pausing in his work and   leaning his saw against a slab of green maple.    \"I am going to take Bessie out for a short walk,\" replied Mary   Matilda.    \"Are you not afraid to go alone?\" said Eddie Martin. \"You know the   musquashes are very thick, and this spell of winter weather has made   them very hungry and ferocious.\"    \"No, I am not afraid of the musquashes,\" replied Mary Matilda. But   she _was_ afraid of them: only she did not want to tell Eddie   Martin so, for fear he would want to go with her. This was the first   and only wrong story Mary Matilda ever told.    Having grasped little Bessie by the hand, Mary Matilda stepped over   the fence and was soon lost to view. Scarcely had she gone when a   tall, thin, haggard looking young man came down the street and leaned   over the back gate.    \"Can you tell me,\" he asked in weary tones, \"whether the beautiful   Mary Matilda abides hereabouts?\"    \"She lives here,\" replied Eddie Martin, \"but she has gone for a walk   with little Bessie.\"    \"Whither did they drift?\" queried the mysterious unknown.    \"They started toward the Nashwaaksis,\" said Eddie Martin. \"And I   sadly fear the deadly musquash will pursue them.\"    The stranger turned pale and trembled at the suggestion.    \"Will you lend me your saw for a brief period?\" he asked.    \"Why?\" inquired Eddie Martin.    \"To rescue the fair Mary Matilda from the musquashes,\" replied the   stranger. Then he seized the saw, and with pale face started in the   direction Mary Matilda had gone."]]]
