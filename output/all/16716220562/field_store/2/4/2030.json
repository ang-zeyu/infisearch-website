I am generous and indulgent, and the soul of honor. No one has just reason to disagree with me.  Here I give all men the round trade--no, what in your country you call the square deal.  But you shall see.  You are now associated with me in a great, a gr-r-rand enterprise.  You shall soon see how just and generous I can be--am always.  You shall understand why the son of a noble house need have no foes.  Senor Tomaso, I have taken one great liking to you in the few hours that we have been together. And as for you, Senor Henrico--\"  With a courtly flourish Don Luis wheeled about to face young Hazelton. But the sound of deep breathing was all that came from Harry. Fatigued by the long, rough automobile ride, that young engineer had dropped fast asleep in the broad porch rocker.  \"Your friend is much fatigued,\" spoke Don Luis, with fine consideration. \"If you deem it best, Senor Tomaso, we will arouse him and he shall go to his room for an hour's sleep before the evening meal.\"  \"If his sleeping in the chair doesn't annoy you, Don Luis, my friend will wake up, refreshed, in twenty minutes or so.\"  \"So be it, then.  Let him sleep where he is.  But you, Senor Tomaso, would you not like to step inside and lie down for a while?\"  \"No, I thank you,\" Reade answered.  \"Unlike Hazelton, I feel very wide awake.  When shall we go to the mine?\"  \"To-morrow, or the next day,\" replied the Mexican, with a gesture which almost said that \"any day\" would do.  \"First, you must both rest until you are wholly refreshed.  Then you may want to stroll about the country a bit, and see the odd bits of natural beauty in these mountains, before you give too serious thought to work.\"  \"But that is not our way, Don Luis,\" Tom objected.  \"When we are paid a thousand dollars a month apiece we expect to do an honest day's work six days in every week.\"  \"Ah, then, to-morrow, perhaps we will talk about the work.  And now, if you will pardon me, I will go inside for a few minutes in order to see about some business matters.\"  Readers of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_,\" the \"_High School Boys Series_\" and of the preceding volumes in the present series, will feel that they are already intimately acquainted with Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, a pair of young civil engineers who, through sheer grit, persistence and hard study had already made themselves well known in their profession.  In the first volume of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_,\" Dick Prescott and his five boy chums, Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, were introduced under the name of Dick & Co. These six chums, standing shoulder to shoulder, made a famous sextette in school athletics.  Their start was made during their grammar school days, when they had many adventures and did much in the field of junior sport.  Their high school life, as set forth in the series of that name, was one of athletics, mixed with much study and efforts to find their true paths in life.  In high school athletics the members of Dick & Co. won a statewide reputation, as to-day members of winning high school athletic teams are bound to do.  It was during their high school days that Dick & Co. determined on their professions through life. Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes both secured competitive appointments to the United States Military Academy, and their further doings are set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dalzell, with a burning desire for naval life, obtained appointments to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.  What befell them is fully told in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  As for Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, while still in high school they became seized with a strong desire for careers as civil engineers.  They were fortunate enough to secure their first practice and training in a local engineering office in the home town of Gridley.  Then, with vastly more courage than training, Tom and Harry went forth into the world to stand or fall as engineers.  Their first experiences are told in the opening volume of this series, \"_The Young Engineers In Colorado_.\"  Joining a western engineering force as \"cub\" engineers, at first the laughing-stock of the older engineers on the staff of a new railroad then building in Colorado, the two boys did their best to make good.  How well they succeeded is known to readers of that volume.  Their adventures in the Rocky Mountains were truly astounding; some of them, especially those with \"Bad Pete,\" a braggart and scoundrel of the old school, were sometimes mirth-provoking and sometimes tragic.  Other adventures were vastly more serious.  When the boys reached the crisis of their work it seemed as though every tree in the mountains concealed an enemy.  All these and many more details are told in that first volume.  In \"_The Young Engineers In Arizona_,\" we found the pair engaged in a wholly new task--that of filling up an apparently unfillable quicksand in the desert so that a railway roadbed might be built safely over the dangerous quicksand that had justly earned the name of the \"Man-killer.\"  Here, too, adventures quickly appeared and multiplied, until even the fearful quicksand became a matter of smaller importance to the chums.  How the two young engineers persevered and fought pluckily all the human and other obstacles to their success the readers of the second volume now know fully.  Then Tom and Harry, who had been putting in many spare hours, days and weeks on the study of metallurgy and the assaying of precious metals, went, for a \"vacation,\" to Nevada, there further to pursue their studies.  Quite naturally they became interested in gold mining itself, and all their adventures, their mishaps, failures, fights and final successes were fully chronicled in the third volume, entitled \"_The Young Engineers in Nevada_.\"  The mine that finally proved a dividend payer was named \"The Ambition Mine.\"  A staunch Nevadan, Jim Ferrers, by name, became their partner in the Ambition.  Jim, who was an old hand at Nevada mining, was now managing the mine while Tom and Harry, after going East and establishing an engineers' office in a large city not far from New York, had traveled to other states, studying mines and assay methods.  Within the last few months, so rapid had been their progress in mine engineering, that they had been consulted by a number of mine owners.  Articles that they had written had appeared in journals devoted to mining and engineering, and the fame of our two friends had been rapidly spreading.  Both scrupulously honest in all things, Reade and Hazelton had also won a reputation as \"square\" mining men.  With their skill and honesty established, the opinions of the two partners on mining problems were generally respected wherever they happened to be known.  So, in time, Luis Montez had heard of them, and had decided that he needed their services at _El Sombrero_ (The Hat) Mine in the Mexican state of Bonista.  After some correspondence the two engineers had been speedily engaged, and the opening of this volume deals with the time of their arrival at the handsome country house of Senor Montez.  After his host had gone inside, and Harry Hazelton slept on, Tom, who had risen--to bow to Senor Montez, remained on his feet, pacing slowly and thoughtfully up and down the porch.  \"Now that I've seen my new employer,\" mused Tom, under his breath, \"I wonder just how much I really like him.  He's a polished man, and a charming fellow from the little that I've seen of him. But his talk of ruling these hills, even in life and death--does that speak well for him.  Is he a knave, or only a harmless braggart? Is he a man against whom one should be seriously on his guard? Don Luis's manners, in general, I admire, but I don't quite like the cruel expression about his month when he laughs.  However, that may be the way of the country, and I may be the victim of prejudice.  Anyway, as far as Harry and I are concerned, we needn't worry much about the kind of man Don Luis is.  The few thousands of dollars that he will owe us as his engineers we are pretty certain to get, for Don Luis is a very wealthy man, and he couldn't afford to cheat us.  For the rest, all he wants us to do is to work hard as engineers and show him how to get more valuable ore out of his mines.  So, no matter what kind of man Don Luis may be, we have nothing to fear from him--not even being cheated out of our pay.\"  Having settled this in his mind, Tom Reade sank into one of the roomy porch chairs, half closing his eyes.  He was soon in danger of being as sound asleep as was Harry Hazelton.  Certainly Reade would have been intensely interested had he been able to render himself invisible and thus to step into one of the rooms of the big, handsome house.  In a room that was half office, half library, Senor Luis Montez was now closeted with another man, whom neither of the engineers had yet met.  This man was short, slight of build and nervous of action and gesture--a young man perhaps twenty-six years of age.  Carlos Tisco was secretary to Don Luis.  Tisco was a graduate of a university at the capital City of Mexico, a doctor of philosophy, no mean chemist, a clever assayer of precious metals and an engineer. In a word Dr. Tisco had been so well trained in many fields of science that it was a wonder that Don Luis should feel the need of employing the two young American engineers.  \"You have seen my new engineers, Carlos?\" queried Don Luis, almost in a whisper, as the two men, bending forward, faced each other over a flat-top desk.  \"Through the window shutters--yes, Don Luis,\" nodded the secretary, a strange look in his eyes.  \"Then what do you think of the Gringo pair, my good Carlos?\" pursued Don Luis.  \"Gringo\" is a word of contempt applied by some Mexicans to Americans.  \"I--I hardly like to tell you, Don Luis,\" replied the younger man, with an air of pretended embarrassment.  \"Ah!  Then no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#2)"],["body","you feel they are not as clever as they have been rated--my two Gringos,\" smiled the mine owner.  \"Rest easy, Carlos.  It may be better if they be not too clever.\"  \"It--it is that which I fear, Don Luis,\" replied the secretary, in a still lower voice.  \"I have been studying their faces--especially their eyes as they spoke.  Don Luis, I much fear that they are very clever young men.\"  \"Ah!  Then again that is not bad,\" laughed the master gayly. \"If they be clever, then they will not need so much explanation.\"  Now the secretary became bolder.  \"Don Luis, though you have spent many years in the United States, I fear you do not at all understand some traits of the Gringo character,\" warned Dr. Tisco.  \"For example, you want these young men for a special service, and you are willing to pay them generously--lavishly in fact.  Has it escaped you, Don Luis, that some of these obstinate, mule-headed Gringos are guilty of an especial form of ingratitude which they term honor?\"  \"I know that some Gringos make much bombastic use of that term, while other Gringos scoff at the word 'honor,'\" replied the mine owner, thoughtfully.  \"But even suppose that these Gringos have absurdly fanciful ideas of honor?  They will never guess for what I really want them.  Their work will be done, to my liking, and they will go away from here with never a suspicion of the kind of service they have performed for me.\"  \"Pardon me, Don Luis,\" murmured Dr. Tisco, \"but to me they do not look like such fools.  They will suspect; they will even know.\"  \"It matters little what they suspect, if they hold their tongues,\" replied the mine owner.  \"You will have to appeal to their love of money, then,\" suggested the secretary.  \"You will have to pay them extremely well.  Even then they may balk and refuse.\"  \"Refuse?\" repeated Don Luis opening his eyes wide.  \"Carlos, you do not seem to understand how hopeless it would be for them to refuse.  I am master here.  None knows better than you that I hold life and death in my hand in these mountains.  Do not all men hereabouts obey my orders?  Will _el gobernador_ ask any awkward questions if two Gringos should stroll through these mountains and never be heard from again?  Who can escape the net that I am able to spread in these mountains?  The Gringos refuse me--betray me?  Are they such fools as to refuse me when they find that I hold their lives in the palm of my hand?\"  \"They may even refuse your bait with death as the alternative,\" persisted the secretary.  \"Don Luis, you know that there are such foolish men among the Gringos.\"  \"Then let them refuse me,\" proposed Don Luis, jestingly, though his white teeth shone in a savage smile.  \"If they are difficult to manage--these two young Gringos--then they will quickly disappear, and other Gringos shall come until I find those that will serve me and be grateful for their rewards.\"  \"I wish you good fortune with your great schemes, Don Luis,\" sighed young Dr. Tisco.  \"Carlos, you have not eaten for hours.  You are so famished that the whole world is colored blue before your eyes.  Come, it is close to the hour for the meal.  You shall meet and talk with my Gringos. You will then be able to judge whether I shall be able to tame them.\"     CHAPTER II  THE WOLF WHO SHOWED HIS TEETH   A rare host at table was Don Luis Montez.  He possessed the manner, even if not the soul, of a great nobleman.  His daughter, Francesca, reputed to be a beauty, did not appear at table.  So far the young engineers had not met her.  They would be presented, however, within a day or two, after the Mexican custom, for Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton were to be guests in the white palace during their residence in this part of Mexico.  Dr. Tisco, too, tried to be most entertaining, and succeeded.  \"You are the surgeon at the mine?\" Harry ventured.  \"A _medico_?\" suggested Dr. Tisco, with a bow of humility.  \"Ah, no, senor, I have not that honor.  I am a doctor of philosophy, not of medicine.\"  \"Then you may be a scientific expert,\" Harry hazarded.  \"You are the expert here at the mine?\"  \"Not so,\" broke in Don Luis, gently.  \"It is true that Carlos has some knowledge of chemistry, but he is not a mining expert.  He is my secretary, my man of affairs.\"  \"Oh, really the manager of the mine, then?\" pursued Harry.  \"Pardon me if I ask too many questions.  I do not mean to be impertinent. But, as we are going to work here I wish to know who's who is Senor Montez' representative.\"  \"Carlos,\" broke in Don Luis, again, \"is rather more than the mine manager.  He serves me in a variety of interests, and the mine is only one of them.\"  \"If you wish to know whether you are to be under my instructions,\" Dr. Tisco continued, \"I can assure you that you are not.  I seldom give orders except as the direct--I might say the directed--mouthpiece of Don Luis.\"  \"I have a separate manager at the mine,\" added Don Luis.  \"You shall meet him to-morrow.  His name is Pedro Gato.  You will find him a self-opinionated fellow, and one used to having his own way.  He has to be somewhat turbulent, or he would never hold some of my _peons_ (laborers) in check.  But under the surface you will find Pedro Gato an excellent fellow if you do not rub him too hard the wrong way.\"  \"Gato will not attempt to give us any orders, of course?\"  Tom asked very quietly.  \"Possibly not,\" dubiously replied Don Luis.  \"I really do not know.  That point has not before come up to me for consideration.\"  \"Then I hope you will make it clear to Senor Gato, Don Luis, that we are engineers, wholly in charge of our own work; that we have been engaged as experts and that we manage our own work in the way that appears to us best to serve our employer's interests.\"  \"That can all be arranged very amicably, I am certain,\" replied Don Luis, as though to dismiss the matter for the present.  Dr. Tisco, covertly, was intently watching the eyes and faces of the young engineers.  The secretary was most anxious to take an accurate measure of these two young Americans, who were now highly \\ important to his plans.  After the evening meal, Don Luis summoned a number of his home retainers, who played mandolins and guitars.  Some of them sang with considerable sweetness and power.  The full moon, soon to wane, shed lustrous light over the tropical scene of beauty. It was a delightful evening.  Tom and Harry, when they retired, found themselves ready to sleep instantly.  Their bedrooms opened into a common parlor.  Early in the morning they were astir.  \"What shall we wear, Tom?\" inquired Hazelton, going toward his trunks.  \"Eh?\"  \"I wonder what people wear in Mexico,\" Harry continued.  \"I don't want to make any mistake in my clothing.\"  \"The best clothing for engineers about to go down into a mine will be top-boots, khaki trousers and flannel shirts.\"  \"But will that be suitable to go to breakfast in?\" Harry asked. \"Will it be showing sufficient courtesy to our host?  And suppose the daughter should be at table?\"  \"That's so,\" Reade nodded.  \"I am sorry that we didn't fish for points last evening.\"  A knock came at the door.  \"Aqui!\" (here) Tom answered.  The door opened slowly.  A man servant of perhaps twenty-five years, attired in clean white clothes, but bare-footed, stood in the doorway, bowing very low.  \"_Buenos dias_, _caballeros_!\" (good morning, gentlemen) was his greeting.  Tom invited him to enter.  \"_Caballeros_,\" announced the _peon_, \"I am your servant, your slave, your dog!  My name is Nicolas.\"  \"How do you do, Nicolas,\" responded Tom, holding out his hand, which the Mexican appeared too dazed, or too respectful to take. \"We may find a servant useful.  But we never kept slaves, and we wouldn't dream of calling any man a dog.\"  \"I am your dog, _caballeros_,\" Nicolas asserted.  \"I am yours to do with as you wish.  Beat me, if I do not perform my work well.\"  \"But I wouldn't beat a dog.  Almost any dog is too fine a fellow to be served in that fashion,\" Tom explained.  \"_Caballeros_, I am here to receive your pleasure and commands concerning breakfast.\"  \"Is it ready?\" demanded Harry hopefully.  \"The kitchen is open, and the cooks there,\" Nicolas responded. \"When your excellency's orders have been given the cooks will prepare your meal with great dispatch.\"  \"Has Don Luis come down yet?\" Tom inquired.  \"No; for his great excellency has not yet eaten,\" answered the _peon_.  \"Oh!  Then your master eats in his own room?\" Tom asked.  \"Don Luis eats always his breakfast in bed,\" Nicolas told them.  \"Then I guess we were too fresh, Tom, in getting up,\" laughed Harry.  As this was spoken in English, Nicolas, not understanding, paid no heed.  Tom and Harry, on the other hand, had a conversational smattering of Spanish, for in Arizona they had had a large force of Mexican laborers working under them.  \"Nicolas, my good boy,\" Tom went on, \"we are quite new to the ways of Mexico.  We shall have to ask you to explain some matters to us.\"  \"I am a dog,\" said Nicolas, gravely, \"but even a dog may speak according to his knowledge.\"  \"Then of what does the breakfast here usually consist?\"  \"Of anything in Don Luis's larder,\" replied the _peon_ grandly.  \"Yet surely there must be some rule about the meal.\"  \"The only rule, excellency, is the pleasure of the host.\"  \"What does Don Luis, then, usually order?\"  \"Chocolate,\" replied the servant.  \"Nothing else?\"  \"And a roll or two, excellency.\"  \"What does he eat after that?\" Harry demanded, rather anxiously.  \"Nothing, _caballero_, until the next meal.\"  \"Chocolate and a roll or two,\" muttered Harry.  \"I am afraid that wouldn't hold me through a day's work.  Not even a forenoon's toil.  I never did like to diet on a plan of tightening my belt.\"  \"Anything for which the _caballero_ will ask shall be brought,\" replied Nicolas, with another bow.  \"How about a steak, Tom?\" Harry asked, turning to his chum.  \"Pardon, excellency, but we have no such thing here,\" Nicolas interposed, meekly.  \"Eggs?\" Harry guessed.  \"Exce"]]]
