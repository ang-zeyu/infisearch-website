Beyond the rock, a brisk fire made dimly visible what appeared to be a large cavern. The fire seemed to be in the exact center of a large underground room and beyond it Hal thought he could make out the mouths of dark passageways that led off in several directions.  \"Come up to the fire and get warm,\" the big Cossack invited.  The others accepted the invitation, first discarding their heavy outer garments. When all appeared comfortable, the big Cossack spoke.  \"Now,\" he said, addressing Hal, \"tell me of Alexis. He is--\"  \"Dead,\" Hal interrupted quietly.  Ivan sprang to his feet.  \"Dead!\" he shouted. \"And you dare to tell it to me? You, no doubt, had a hand in his death!\"  \"On the contrary,\" returned the lad quietly, \"I tried to save him, as did my chum; but it was too late. But he died like a brave man and a true Cossack.\"  Ivan was silent for several moments, and then said sneeringly:  \"And what do you know of the Cossacks?\"  \"Well, very little, to be sure,\" Hal confessed, \"though, for a short time, I had the honor of serving in a Cossack regiment.\"  \"What, you?\" exclaimed Ivan incredulously. \"Impossible.\"  \"No; what I say is true,\" said Hal. \"And it was there that I met your brother Alexis, than whom I have never seen a braver man.\"  \"'Tis true,\" muttered Ivan. \"Alexis was ever a brave man, though much given to boasting. Also, barring perhaps myself, he was the most powerful man I have ever seen.\"  \"He was indeed,\" replied Hal, \"and it will give me pleasure at some time to relate to you some of the remarkable feats I have seen him accomplish.\"  \"Alexis has related enough,\" returned Ivan dryly. \"But come, now, tell me what you know of him.\"  \"Well,\" Hal began, \"I met Alexis first--\"  He stopped suddenly and listened attentively.  \"What was that?\" he demanded.  \"What?\" asked Edwards.  \"I thought I heard a voice calling. Sounded like a cry for help.\"  Ivan broke into a loud laugh.  \"Ho! Ho!\" he cried. \"Guess you heard my prisoners.\"  \"Prisoners?\" Hal repeated inquiringly.  \"Yes. I came across them this afternoon. They sought to ply me with questions. I treated them respectfully enough, but when they continued to plague me, I just picked them up and brought them here. I have a suspicion they may be Austrian spies and if there is one race of men for whom I have no use, it is the Austrians. But they do not annoy you, do they? If so, I shall go back and have a word with them. After that I assure you they will annoy you no more.\"  \"Oh, no,\" Hal hastened to say. \"They do not annoy me in the slightest. But what do you intend to do with them?\"  \"Well, I don't know exactly,\" returned Ivan. \"You know I have read somewhat, and I remember the things I have read. For instance now, I would like to be like one of the old kings, or say even a present-day American, of whom I have heard much. They have slaves and things. Why not make my prisoners my slaves?\"  \"I assure you you are wrong about the Americans,\" said Hal. \"I chance to be one myself, so I know. Of kings, I cannot say.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Ivan. \"We'll attend to them later on. Right now I have a desire to hear your story. Proceed.\"  Hal did so. He related his and Chester's first meeting with Alexis, the big brave-hearted man who had once played an important part in their lives, as related in \"The Boy Allies With the Cossacks.\" He told of the many exciting adventures the three had gone through together.  And as the lad progressed with his narrative, Ivan became more interested with each word; and by the time Hal had come to an account of his brother's last great fight, Ivan was on his feet, his face glowing.  \"By St. George!\" he cried. \"I knew he could do it. Boaster or not, he was a brave man. But go on. And after he had killed the three Germans there on the sand, then what?\"  \"Why, then,\" said Hal, \"a German bullet struck him in the right shoulder; a moment later another lodged in his right side. But Alexis did not pause. He rushed right into the thick of them, using his now empty pistols and at last striking out with his bare fists. Men tumbled on all sides.  \"From behind and from both sides, the Germans darted at him, firing their revolvers and stabbing him with the swords. By this time, we had finished repairing our machine and we rushed to his aid, and for a moment the Germans gave back. Then they closed in and we were all hard pressed. Alexis was bleeding in a dozen places but he fought on. And then aid came from an unexpected source.\"  \"Where?\" demanded Ivan excitedly.  \"Troops,\" replied Hal. \"Troops sent to protect the neutrality of the country; and with their approach the Germans who were still upon their feet fled. Chester and I dragged Alexis to our own craft and we also ascended. There we did what we could for him, but he realized that he was past aid, and he died as a brave man should. We buried him in England with honor, and with him the Cross of St. George, personally bestowed upon him by the Czar.\"  For a long time after the lad had finished, Ivan was silent. Then he said, his fists clenching:  \"I would I had been there! There would have been a different story to tell!\"  Hal was about to reply, but a voice sounded suddenly. Hal pricked up his ears. Surely he recognized that voice. The cry came again.  \"Chester!\" shouted Hal, and sprang to his feet.     CHAPTER VIII.  A DESPERATE VENTURE.   Before Ivan could raise a hand to stay him, had such been his intention, Hal had darted across the cavern in the direction from which had come the sound he had recognized as Chester's voice. It was very dark there and the lad could not make out his surroundings, but he seemed to have brought up against a solid wall. He explored the smooth surface with his hands, but could find no opening in that particular spot. Then he came upon one of the narrow passageways and entered it without hesitation, for he believed it was in that direction he would find Chester.  Now heavy footsteps sounded behind him and Ivan's voice roared:  \"Where are you going?\"  \"It is Chester--my friend who was with me when Alexis died,\" returned Hal. \"I heard his voice. He must be near some place and in trouble.\"  \"Ho!\" said Ivan. \"He will be one of my prisoners, I expect. I remember that one was rather young.\"  \"Well, let him out, will you?\" exclaimed Hal.  \"Certainly,\" returned Ivan.  He passed Hal and led the way down the dark passage. Presently Hal heard a huge rock move and then footsteps came toward him.  \"Who is it?\" he asked.  There came a cry of surprise.  \"That you, Hal?\" came in Chester's voice. \"How on earth did you get here?\"  \"That's rather a long story,\" replied Hal, \"but it seems that it's a good thing I did get here. I thought a heard a sound awhile back. It must have been you.\"  \"Anderson and I have been yelling for the last week, it seems,\" said Chester ruefully. \"We didn't hope to be fortunate enough to raise you, but we thought some one might hear us.\"  \"Well, come on out here to the fire--and you, too, Colonel,\" his last to Colonel Anderson, who now came forward, closely followed by Ivan.  They needed no urging, for they had been shut up in the cold so long that they were almost frozen. Introductions now followed all around and Ivan seemed genuinely pleased to meet Chester. He was profuse in his apologies for his rough treatment, while Chester was dumbfounded to learn that his captor was the brother of his old friend Alexis. They shook hands heartily.  \"If you had not pestered me with so many questions, I would not have bothered you,\" Ivan explained. \"To tell the truth, I took you for a couple of Austrian spies.\"  \"Tell us, Chester,\" said Hal, \"what have you learned?\"  \"Learned?\" echoed Chester. \"We haven't learned anything, except that it is awfully cold in these mountains. I'm going to tell you right now, it's no fun being locked up in an icebox.\"  \"It is not,\" Colonel Anderson agreed dryly, stretching his feet out to the fire.  \"I'll tell you how it came about,\" said Chester, smiling at Ivan. \"Colonel Anderson and I had just completed a most terrible climb. Coming once again to a level spot we sat down to rest. We saw a man coming along--a big man, none other than Ivan here. I suggested that we ask him a few questions.\"  \"You asked them, all right,\" said Ivan.  \"Well,\" Chester continued, \"he didn't tell us much. In fact, he was as mum as an oyster. Colonel Anderson took a hand with no better luck. It seems that between us we talked too much. Ivan here didn't like it. He said he guessed he'd have to take us along with him. We said we were satisfied to stay where we were. This didn't suit Ivan. He reached for me and I dodged; but with his other hand he grabbed Anderson and held him helpless.  \"I drew my gun but I was afraid to fire for fear of hitting the Colonel. I thought I would rap the big man over the head with the butt of the weapon. I ventured a trifle too close and he nailed me, too. He shook me so hard that I dropped my gun. Anderson hadn't been able to get at his. Then Ivan relieved him of it, and still holding us each by an arm, he brought us here.  \"When he shoved us under the rock ahead of him, we decided to jump him if he came in. We jumped him. It didn't do much good, did it, Colonel?\"  Chester turned to Colonel Anderson with a smile.  \"Not much,\" was the Colonel's dry response.  Ivan grinned sheepishly.  \"I didn't mean to hurt you too much,\" he said. \"You see, sometimes I don't realize my own strength. I guess maybe I squeezed your arms too hard.\"  \"Well, now tell us about yourself, Hal,\" said Chester, \"and who is this little fellow who hangs so close to Stubbs?\"  \"This little fellow,\" returned Hal, \"has appointed himself Stubbs' best friend. Stubbs overcame him in fair fight this afternoon and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12805"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Balkan Campaign; Or, the Struggle to Save a Nation (#7)"],["body","Stubbs is a great man.\"  \"Well, what's the matter?\" Stubbs broke in. \"Don't you?\"  \"Of course,\" Hal hastened to assure him.  Stubbs subsided grumbling.  \"The question now is,\" Colonel Edwards declared, \"what are we going to do? There is no use staying here longer than we can possibly help. We had better be moving.\"  \"Hold on,\" shouted Ivan, jumping suddenly to his feet. \"Tell me what it is you are going to do? Perhaps I may lend a hand. I know something of these mountains.\"  Colonel Edwards glanced at Hal. The boy nodded.  \"Might be a good idea,\" he said.  Then Colonel Edwards explained. Ivan heard him patiently.  \"Well,\" he said at length, \"nothing would please me more than to join this expedition.\" He spoke to Hal. \"You have told me of the service rendered the Czar by my brother Alexis. I am ashamed that I have been idling here in these mountains while my country needs me. I shall try and make up for it in the future. Now, I believe I can tell you what you want to know.\"  \"Then,\" asked Colonel Edwards, \"is there a strong Austrian sentiment among the Albanians?\"  \"Until a month ago there was little Austrian sentiment,\" returned Ivan, \"But recently there has been a change, and the change I lay at the door of a single man.\"  \"An Albanian?\"  \"It is even worse than that. The man is a Montenegrin. And still worse. He bears the same name as the king of Montenegro, Nicolas. He has, most likely, another name, but I do not know it.\"  \"But why should a Montenegrin seek to raise the enmity of the Albanians against his own people?\" Chester demanded.  \"There is but one reason--gold,\" said Ivan simply.  \"And his methods?\" inquired Colonel Anderson.  \"More gold,\" was the reply.  \"I see,\" said Colonel Anderson. \"Furnished by the Austrians, eh?\"  \"How else? I have had several interviews with this Nicolas. He seems to think I could be of use to him. In fact, he has made me offers. But while I have taken no part in active fighting, although I admit I have neglected my own country, I have not fallen low enough for that sort of work. However, I did not tell Nicolas that. I temporized with him and I suppose he believes he can win me over if he cares to make his offer tempting enough.\"  \"All this,\" said Hal slowly, \"suggests a plan.\"  \"Well?\" said Chester, expectantly.  \"And by this plan of mine,\" Hal continued, \"we may accomplish even more than we set out to do.\"  \"Explain, Hal,\" said Colonel Anderson.  \"It's very simple. We'll have Ivan take us to Nicolas. He can tell him we are Germans, or what you please. Being, apparently, friends of Ivan's, we shall be received. Then Ivan can appear to fall in with his plans. At the first opportune moment, we shall take charge of Mr. Nicolas and escape.\"  \"H-m-m-m,\" mused Colonel Edwards. \"You say all that easily enough, but you can take my word for it, it will be no small job.\"  \"Of course not,\" Chester agreed, \"but still we should be able to do it. And if we do, we shall have removed the cause of the Albanian enmity toward Montenegro. There will be no such strong Austrian sentiment once the supply of gold is cut off.\"  Ivan jumped to his feet and clapped the lad on the back.  \"Good!\" he exclaimed eagerly. \"I'm with you; and if it comes to a fight, you will find that you can use me to advantage.\"  \"I am sure of it,\" smiled Hal.  Ivan, in turning, cast his eye upon the little dwarfed figure of Nikol. He walked quickly toward him and extended a hand.  \"We didn't finish our little argument awhile ago,\" he said simply. \"I see no reason why we should finish it. Why should we fight each other when there are others to fight?\" He turned to Hal. \"I'll guarantee this man will give a good account of himself,\" he said. \"I doubt if there is another man in the mountains, besides myself, who has his strength. He will prove his worth.\"  He turned to Nikol again and the dwarf grinned at him, showing strong white teeth.  \"You are right,\" he said and gripped Ivan's hand hard.  \"Well then,\" said Colonel Edwards, \"the sooner we get started the sooner we may get back again. When shall we start, Ivan?\"  \"Immediately,\" was the reply, and the giant moved toward the mouth of the cavern.  \"Now, look-a-here, you fellows,\" said the voice of Anthony Stubbs. \"I've been a whole lot of places with you and I hope to go with you a whole lot more, but I claim it is downright foolishness to stick our heads into a brigand's lair. What's the use? The best we can get is the worst of it.\"  \"Stubbs,\" said Hal quietly, \"you don't have to go along if you don't want to. You can stay right here.\"  \"What?\" exclaimed the little man. \"Stay here by myself? I should say not. I don't want to stay here alone and I don't want to go hunting brigands. What I want to do is get some place where it's safe. I don't like this country, if you want to know it.\"  \"It's a good country,\" said Nikol abruptly.  Stubbs looked at the dwarf in surprise. It was the first time the Albanian had talked back to him.  \"What do you know about it?\" demanded Stubbs. \"You never saw a regular country.\"  The dwarf bowed his head in some confusion. Apparently Stubbs' spell still held good over him.  \"Come, Stubbs, don't be stubborn,\" said Chester.  \"Well, all right,\" said the little man, shaking his head sadly. \"I'll go if the rest of you do, but I want to tell you right now, I protest!\"     CHAPTER IX.  THE TRAITOR.   \"If I am not mistaken,\" said Ivan, \"here comes Nicolas now.\"  He pointed to a large, bearded individual, who, surrounded by probably a dozen other figures, was advancing toward them. The man swung along with the free and easy stride of the mountaineer, looking neither to the right nor to the left, his head erect and of haughty mien.  \"Pompous sort of a looking customer,\" said Colonel Anderson to Hal.  \"Rather,\" said the lad dryly. He glanced at the others, Colonel Edwards, Stubbs, Nikol, Ivan and Chester, and muttered hurriedly: \"After this we must do all our talking in German.\"  The others nodded their understanding and all fell silent as the Montenegrin traitor and his henchmen approached.  It was the morning following the night upon which they had left Ivan's retreat. The journey had consumed the whole night, but in spite of their fatigue, each member of the party of seven was on his mettle. Now, as Nicolas drew closer, Ivan took a step in advance of the others to greet him.  The traitor's face lighted with pleasure as he recognized the big Cossack.  \"Ah, Ivan,\" he said, \"I am glad to see you.\"  He noticed the others, and a slight frown flitted across his face. He swept his arm toward them in a comprehensive gesture. \"Who are these?\"  \"One of them you probably know,\" said Ivan and he indicated Nikol.  Nikol nodded affirmatively.  \"The others,\" Ivan continued, \"I came across in the mountains last night. They are Germans and were seeking you.\"  \"Seeking me?\" exclaimed Nicolas in astonishment. \"And why should they be seeking me?\"  \"You will probably know,\" returned Ivan, \"when I tell you they come from Germany.\"  \"Ah,\" said Nicolas. \"Of course I know, Ivan. Will you have them come forward?\"  \"One moment, Nicolas,\" said Ivan. \"First I would have a word with you myself.\"  \"Proceed,\" said the Montenegrin.  \"Well, then,\" Ivan went on, \"you may remember a certain proposal you have made me upon several occasions?\"  \"I do,\" exclaimed Nicolas, with unfeigned eagerness. \"Can it be that at last you have decided to--\"  \"Accept?\" interrupted Ivan. \"Yes; I have decided to accept; and these Germans here have had something to do with my decision. They have told me how Germany and Austria combined will eventually win the great war and of the good things that will be in store for all of us when that day comes. You are right, Nicolas, it is well to be on the winning side.\"  \"And I am glad you see it that way,\" declared Nicolas, extending a hand, which Ivan grasped, much to his distaste. \"I have long wanted a trusted lieutenant, and you shall be he.\"  \"Thanks, Nicolas,\" returned Ivan. \"I had not expected that. Had you told me before it might have influenced me sooner. But now I shall have the others approach. By the way, you speak German?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Good; then there is no need of an interpreter.\"  He raised his hand and at the signal the others came forward. Ivan presented each in turn, applying to each a German name that had been agreed upon during the night's travel. Nicolas expressed his pleasure at seeing them and after a few words of pleasantry, said:  \"Now, gentlemen, if you will accompany me to my quarters, I shall try and make you feel at home.\"  As they walked along Hal and Chester took stock of the Montenegrin. Big he was, fully as tall and as broad as Ivan himself, and his great arms hung below his knees. He was the personification of rugged strength and brutality. From Nicolas the lads turned their eyes to Ivan. There was scarcely a noticeable difference in the stature of the two men and from casual observation it would have been hard to choose between them in the matter of strength. But the one noticeable difference was in the eyes.  Ivan's eyes looked one straight in the face, while Nicolas' shifted uneasily when he was observed closely. It was the difference in the eyes that told the difference between the two men better than anything else.  Presently Nicolas stopped before an extremely large hut, built up close beside a giant rock. He stood aside and motioned the others to enter. They did so and Nicolas, after a word to his men, came in after them and closed the door. Then he motioned them all to seats and sat down himself. He eyed his guests in silence for a few moments, and finally remarked:  \"Well?\"  Hal took it upon himself to do the talking.  \"First,\" he said, \"we would like to know how you are progressing?\"  \"Beautifully,\" was Nicolas' reply. \"I have distributed the gold given me for that purpose, first, of course, taking out my own share. The Albanians, knowing the poverty of the Montenegrins, have been convinced by the gold that final success in"]]]
