Oh, dear me, no!\"  Mr. Preston laughed most heartily.  \"No; she is not in the least ill, Mr. Dalzell, though, on Monday, she may feel a bit nervous toward noon,\"  \"Nervous---on Monday?\" asked Dan vaguely.  It seemed rank nonsense that her uncle should be able to predict her condition so definitely on another day.  \"Why, yes; Monday is to be the great day, of course.\"  \"Great day, sir?  And why 'of course'?\" inquired Dan, now as much interested as he was mystified.  \"Why, my niece is to be married Monday at high noon.\"  \"Married?\" gasped Midshipman Dalzell, utterly astounded and discomfited by such unlooked-for news.  \"Yes; didn't you know Miss Preston was engaged to be married?\"  \"I---I certainly did not,\" Dan stammered.  \"Why, she spoke to you much of 'Oscar'-----\"  \"Her brother?\"  \"No; the man who will be her husband on Monday,\" went on Mr. Preston blandly.  Being quite near-sighted the elder man had not discovered Dan's sudden emotion.  \"That is what occupies us to-night.  We leave on the first car for Baltimore in the morning.  Mrs. Preston is now engaged over our trunks.\"  \"I---I am very certain, then, that I have come at an unseasonable time,\" Dan answered hastily.  \"I did not know---which fact, I trust, will constitute my best apology for having intruded at such a busy season, Mr. Preston.\"  \"There has been no intrusion, and therefore no apology is needed, sir,\" replied Mr. Preston courteously.  Dan got out, somehow, without staggering, or without having his voice quiver.  Once in the street he started along blindly, his fists clenched.  \"So that's the way she uses me, is it?\" he demanded of himself savagely.  \"Plays with me, while all the time the day for her wedding draws near.  She must be laughing heartily over---my greenness! Oh, confound all girls, anyway!\"  It was seldom that Midshipman Dalzell allowed himself to get in a temper.  He had been through many a midshipman fight without having had his ugliness aroused.  But just now Dan felt humiliated, sore in spirit and angry all over---especially with all members of the gentler sex.  He even fancied that Mr. Preston was at that moment engaged in laughing over the verdant midshipman.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Preston was doing nothing of the sort.  Mr. Preston had not supposed that Dan's former call had been intended as anything more than a pleasant social diversion.  The Prestons supposed that every one knew that their niece was betrothed to an excellent young fellow.  So, at this particular moment, Mr. Preston was engaged in sitting on a trunk, while his wife tried to turn the key in the lock.  Neither of them was favoring Midshipman Dalzell with as much as a thought.  \"Why on earth is it that all girls are so tricky?\" Dan asked himself savagely, taking it for granted that all girls are \"tricky\" where admirers are concerned.  \"Oh, my, what a laugh Davy will have over me, when he hears!\" was Dan's next bitter thought, as he strode along.  Having just wronged all girls in his own estimation of them, Dan was now proceeding to do his own closest chum an injustice.  For Dave Darrin was too thorough a gentleman to laugh over any unfortunate's discomfiture.  \"What a lucky escape I had from getting better acquainted with that girl!\" was Dalzell's next thought.  \"Why, with one as wholly deceitful as she is there can be no telling where it would all have ended.  She might have drawn me into troubles that would have resulted in my having to leave the service!\"  Dan had not the least desire to do any one an injustice, but just now he was so astounded and indignant that his mind worked violently rather than keenly.  \"Serves me right!\" sputtered Dalzell, at last.  \"A man in the Navy has no business to think about the other sex.  He should give his whole time and thought to his profession and his country. That's what I'll surely do after this.\"  Having reached this conclusion, the midshipman should have been more at peace with himself, but he wasn't.  He had been sorely, even if foolishly wounded in his own self esteem, and it was bound to hurt until the sensation wore off.  \"You'll know more, one of these days, Danny boy,\" was his next conclusion.  \"And what you know will do you a lot more good, too, if it doesn't include any knowledge whatever of girls---except the disposition and the ability to keep away from 'em!  I suppose there are a few who wouldn't fool a fellow in this shameless way but it will be a heap safer not to try to find any of the few!\"  Dan's head was still down, and he was walking as blindly as ever, when he turned a corner and ran squarely into some one.  \"Why don't you look out where you're going?\" demanded that some one.  \"Why don't you look out yourself?\" snapped Midshipman Dalzell, and the next instant a heavy hand was laid upon him.     CHAPTER VI  THE \"FORGOT\" PATH TO TROUBLE   \"Here, confound you!  I'll teach you to-----\"  \"Teach me how to walk the way you were going when I stopped you?\" demanded the same voice, and a harder grip was taken on Dalzell's shoulder.  In his misery Dan was not at all averse to fighting, if a good excuse were offered.  So his first move was not to look up, but to wrest him self out of that grip, haul away and put up his guard.  \"Dave Darrin!\" gasped Midshipman Dan, using his eyes at last.  Dave was laughing quietly.  \"Danny boy, you shouldn't cruise without lights and a bow watch!\" admonished Dave.  \"What sent your wits wool gathering?  You look terribly upset over something.\"  \"Do I?\" asked Dan, looking guilty.  \"You certainly do.  And see here, is this the way to the Preston house?\"  \"No; it's the way away from it.\"  \"But you had permission to visit at the Prestons.\"  \"That isn't any news to me,\" grunted Dalzell.  \"Then---pardon me---but why aren't you there?\"  \"Are you the officer of the day?\" demanded Dan moodily.  \"No; merely your best friend.\"  \"I beg your pardon, Dave.  I am a grouch tonight.\"  \"Wasn't Miss Preston at home.\"  \"I---I don't know.\"  \"Don't know?  Haven't you been there?\"  \"Yes; but I didn't ask-----\"  As Dan hesitated Dave rested both hands on his chum's shoulders, looking sharply into that young man's eyes.  \"Danny, you act as though you were _loco_.  (crazy).  What on earth is up?  You went to call on Miss Preston.  You reached the house, and evidently you left there again.  But you don't know whether Miss Preston was in; you forgot to ask.  Let me look in at the answer to the riddle.\"  \"Dave---Miss Preston is going to be married!\"  \"Most girls are going to be,\" Darrin replied quietly.  \"Do you mean that Miss Preston is going to marry some one else than yourself?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Soon?\"  \"Monday noon.\"  Dave Darrin whistled.  \"So this is the meaning of your desperation?  Danny boy, if you're stung, I'm sincerely sorry for you.\"  \"I don't quite know whether I want any sympathy,\" Dan replied, though he spoke rather gloomily.  \"Perhaps I'm to be congratulated.\"  He laughed mirthlessly, then continued:  \"When a girl will treat a fellow like that, isn't it just as well to find out her disposition early?\"  \"Perhaps,\" nodded Darrin.  \"But Danny, do you mean to say that you attempted to pay your call without an appointment?\"  \"What was the need of an appointment?\" demanded Dan.  \"Miss Preston invited me to call at any time---just drop in.  Now, she must know that Saturday evening is a midshipman's only chance at this time of the year.\"  \"Nevertheless, you were wrong at that point, in the game,\" Dave went on gravely.  \"Unless you're on the best of terms with a young lady, don't attempt to call on her without having learned that your purpose will be agreeable to her.  And so Miss Preston, while receiving your calls, has been engaged to some one else?\"  Dan nodded, adding, \"She might have given me some hint, I should think.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" Darrin answered thoughtfully.  \"Another good view of it would be that a young lady's private affairs are her own property.  Didn't she ever mention the lucky fellow to you?\"  \"It seems that she did,\" Dalzell assented.  \"But I thought, all the time, that she was talking about her brother.\"  \"Why should you especially think it was her brother whom she was mentioning?\"  \"Because she seemed so mighty fond of the fellow,\" Dan grunted.  Dave choked a strong impulse to laugh.  \"Danny boy,\" he remarked, \"girls, very often, are mighty fond, also, of the fellow to whom they're engaged.\"  \"Why did she let me call?\" demanded Dan gloomily.  \"How often have you called?\" inquired Midshipman Darrin.  \"Once, before to-night.\"  \"Only once?  Then, see here, Danny!  Don't be a chump.  When you call on a girl once, and ask if you may call some other time, how on earth is she to guess that you're an intended rival of the man she has promised to marry?\"  \"But-----\" That was as far as Midshipman Dalzell got.  He halted, wondering what he really could say next.  \"Dan, I'm afraid you've got an awful lot to learn about girls, and also about the social proprieties to be observed in calling on them.  As to Miss Preston receiving a call from you, and permitting you to call again, that was something that any engaged girl might do properly enough.  Miss Preston came to Annapolis, possibly to learn something about midshipman life.  She met you and allowed you to call.  Very likely she permitted others to call.  From what you've told me I can't see that she treated you unfairly in any way; I don't believe Miss Preston ever guessed that you had any other than the merest social reasons for calling.\"  \"And I'm not sure that I did have,\" grunted Dalzell.  Dave shot another swift look into his chum's face before he said:  \"Danny boy, your case is a light one.  You'll recover speedily. Your vanity has been somewhat stung,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12775"],["title","Dave Darrin's Fourth Year at Annapolis: Headed for Graduation and the Big Cruise (#7)"],["body"," but your heart won't have a scar in three days from now.\"  \"What makes you think you know so much about that?\" insisted Dan, drawing himself up with a dignified air.  \"It isn't hard to judge, when it's another fellow's case,\" smiled Darrin.  \"I believe that, at this minute, I understand your feelings better than you do yourself.\"  \"I don't know about my feelings,\" proclaimed Dan gloomily still, \"but I do know something about my experience and conclusions. No more girls for me!\"  \"Good idea, Danny boy,\" cried Darrin, slapping his friend on the back.  \"That's the best plan for you, too.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because you haven't head enough to understand girls and their ways.\"  \"I don't want to.\"  \"Good!  I hope you will keep in that frame of mind.  And now, let's talk of something serious.\"  \"Of what, then?\" inquired Dalzell, as the two started to walk along together.  \"Football.\"  \"Is that more serious than girls?\" demanded Dan Dalzell, suspicious that his friend was making fun of him.  \"It's safer, at any rate, for you.  Why, if a girl happens to say, 'Delighted to meet you, Mr. Dalzell,' you expect her to give up all other thoughts but you, and to be at home every Saturday evening.  No, no, Danny.  The company of the fair is not for you. Keep to things you understand better---such as football.\"  Dan Dalzell's eyes shot fire.  He was certain, now, that his chum was poking fun at him, and this, in his present temper, Dan could not quite endure.  \"So, since we've dropped the subject of girls,\" Dave continued placidly, \"what do you think are our real chances for the balance of this season?\"  \"They'd be a lot improved,\" grunted Dan, \"if you'd get the grip on yourself that you had at the beginning of the season.\"  \"I know I'm not playing in as good form as I had hoped to,\" Dave nodded.  \"The worst of it is, I can't find out the reason.\"  \"A lot of the fellows think you've lost interest since you found that you won't have the great Prescott to play against in the Army-Navy game,\" Dan hinted.  \"Yes; I know.  I've heard that suspicion hinted at.\"  \"Isn't it true?\" challenged Dalzell.  \"To the best of my knowledge and belief, it isn't.  Why, Danny, it would be absurd to think that I couldn't play right now, just because Dick isn't to be against us on Franklin Field.\"  \"I know it would sound absurd,\" Dan replied.  \"But let us put it another way, Dave.  All along you've been working yourself up into better form, because you knew that, otherwise, it was very doubtful whether the Navy could beat the Army on the gridiron. So you had worked yourself up to where you played a better game than ever Dick Prescott thought of doing.  Then you hear that poor Dick is in Coventry, and therefore not on the team.  You haven't got the great Army man to beat, and, just for that reason, you slack up on your efforts.\"  \"I am not slacking up,\" retorted Dave with some spirit.  \"I am doing the best that is in me, though I admit I appear to have gone stale.\"  \"And so something will happen,\" predicted Dan.  \"What will that be?\"  \"Between now and the game with the Army, Prescott's comrades will find what boobs they've been, and they'll lift the Coventry. Prescott and Holmes will get into the Army team at the last moment, and the fellows from West Point will ride rough-shod over the Navy, just as they did last year.\"  \"Do you really think that will happen?\" demanded Darrin eagerly. \"Do you really believe that dear old Dick will get out of that Coventry and back on the Army eleven?\"  \"Well,\" returned Midshipman Dalzell soberly, \"I'll venture a prediction. If you don't get a brace on your playing soon, then it'll be regular Navy luck for Prescott to come to Philadelphia and put on his togs.  Then the soldiers will drag us down the field to the tune of 46 to 2.\"  \"I'd sooner he killed on the field than see that happen!\" cried Midshipman Dave, his eyes flashing.  \"Then don't let it happen!  You're the only star on our team, Dave, that isn't up to the mark.  If we lose to the Army, this year, Prescott or no Prescott, it will be your fault, Dave Darrin. You're not one of our weak spots, really but you're not as strong as you ought to be and can be if you'll only brace.\"  \"Brace!\" quivered Dave.  \"Won't I, though?\"  \"Good! Just stick to that.\"  \"Dan!\" Darrin halted his chum before a store where dry goods and notions were sold.  \"Let's go in here-----\"  \"What, for?\" Midshipman Dalzell asked in astonishment.  \"I want to make a purchase,\" replied Dave soberly.  \"Danny boy, I'm going to buy you a hat pin---one at least ten inches long. You're to slip it in, somewhere in your togs.  When you catch me lagging---practice or game---just jab that hat pin into me as far as you can send it.\"  \"Bosh!\" retorted Dan impatiently.  \"Come along.\"  Dave submitted, in patient silence, to being led away from the store.  For some moments the chums strolled along together in silence.  \"Now, speaking of Miss Preston,\" began Dan, breaking the silence at last, \"she-----\"  \"Drop that!  Get back to football, Danny---it's safer,\" warned Dave Darrin.  \"But-----\"  \"Hold on, I tell you!  You had almost recovered, Danny, in the short space of five minutes.  Now, don't bring on a relapse by opening up the old sore.  I shall soon begin to believe it was your heart that was involved, instead of your vanity.\"  \"Oh, hang girls, then!\" exploded Dan.  \"Couldn't think of it,\" urged Dave gently.  \"That wouldn't be chivalrous, and even a midshipman is required to be a gentleman at all times.  So-----\"  \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" spoke a pleasant voice.  The midshipmen glanced up, then promptly brought up their hands in salute to an officer whom they would otherwise have passed without seeing.  That officer was Lieutenant Adams, discipline officer.  \"Are you enjoying your stroll, Mr. Darrin?\" asked Mr. Adams.  \"Very much, sir; thank you.\"  \"And you, Mr. Dalzell.  But let me see---wasn't your liberty for the purpose of paying a visit?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Dan answered, coloring.  \"And you are strolling, instead?\"  \"Yes, sir; the person on whom I went to call was not there.\"  \"Then, Mr. Darrin, you should have returned to Bancroft Hall, and reported your return.\"  \"Yes, sir; I should have done that,\" Dan confessed in confusion. \"The truth is, sir, it hadn't occurred to me.\"  \"Return at once, Mr. Dalzell, and place yourself on report for strolling without permission.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Both midshipmen saluted, then turned for the shortest cut to Maryland Avenue, and thence to the gate at the end of that thoroughfare.  \"Ragged!\" muttered Dan.  \"And without the slightest intention of doing anything improper.\"  \"It was improper, though,\" Dave replied quickly, \"and both you and I should have thought of it in time.\"  \"I really forgot.\"  \"Forgot to think, you mean, Dan, and that's no good excuse in bodies of men where discipline rules.  Really, I should have gone on report, too.\"  \"But you had liberty to stroll in town.\"  \"Yes; but I'm guilty in not remembering to remind you of your plain duty.\"  Lieutenant Adams had not in the least enjoyed ordering Dan to place himself on report.  The officer had simply done his duty. To the average civilian it may seem that Dan Dalzell had done nothing very wrong in taking a walk when he found the purpose of his call frustrated; but discipline, when it imposes certain restrictions on a man, cannot allow the man himself to be the judge of whether he may break the restrictions.  If the man himself is to be the judge then discipline ceases to exist.  \"So I've got to stick myself on pap, and accept a liberal handful of demerits, all on account of a girl?\" grumbled Dan, as the chums turned into the road leading to Bancroft Hall.\"  \"That is largely because you couldn't get the girl out of your head,\" Dave rejoined.  \"Didn't I tell you, Danny, that you hadn't head enough to give any of your attention to the other sex?\"  \"It's tough to get those demerits, though,\" contended Dan.  \"I imagine there'll be a large allowance of them, and in his fourth year a fellow can't receive many demerits without having to get out of the Academy.  One or two more such scrapes, and I'll soon be a civilian, instead of an officer in the Navy!\"  \"See here, Dan; I'll offer an explanation that you can make truthfully. Just state, when you're called up, that you and I were absorbed talking football, and that you really forgot to turn in the right direction while your mind was so full of Navy football.  That may help some.\"  \"Yes; it will---not!\"  Dan Dalzell passed into the outer room of the officer in charge, picked up a blank and filled it out with the report against himself.  Dave was waiting outside as Dan came out from the disagreeable duty of reporting himself.  \"Hang the girls!\" Dalzell muttered again disgustedly.     CHAPTER VII  DAN'S EYES JOLT HIS WITS   Dan Dalzell, on the point of stepping out of Bancroft Hall, wheeled like a flash, and bounded back against Farley, Jetson and Page.  \"Don't look!\" whispered Dan hoarsely.  \"Duck!\"  \"What on earth is the matter?\" demanded Midshipman Darrin, eyeing his chum sharply.  \"I---I don't know what it is,\" muttered Dan, after he had backed his friends some feet from the entrance.  \"What does it look like?\" asked Farley.  \"Something like a messenger boy,\" returned Dan.  \"Surely, you're not afraid of a messenger boy with a telegram,\" laughed Darrin.  \"Little chance that the message is for you, at any rate.\"  \"But---it's got a Naval uniform on, I tell you,\" warned Dan.  \"No; you hadn't told us.  What is it---another midshipman?\"  \"Not by a jugful!\" Dan sputtered.  \"It's wearing an officer's uniform.\"  \"Then undoubtedly you chanced to glance at an officer of the Navy,\" Darrin replied, sarcastically soothing.  \"Brace up, Dan.\"  \"But he's only a kid!\" remonstrated Dan.  \"And he wear a lieutenant's insignia!\"  \"Bosh!  Some officers are quite boyish-looking,\" remarked Farley. \"Come on out, fellows; I haven't forgotten how to salute an officer when I see one.\"  The others,"]]]
