Now, you'll wash the breakfast things, and then the dinner things, before you get even a cold bite to eat.\"  Alf didn't protest.  Now that he was back safe in camp he felt much ashamed of himself for having run away and left the camp unwatched.  As soon as he had eaten his dinner Tom Reade went back to the assay furnace to improve the fire.  \"Now, Harry, we'll get the powdered stuff ready to roast,\" Reade remarked.  \"We've a lot of it to rush through this afternoon.\"  \"And we want to be sure to finish it at least two hours before dark, too,\" Larry nodded.  \"If we decide to file a claim Jim ought to be riding for Dugout City by dark, ready to file the papers the first thing in the morning.\"  \"And Jim can bring back half a dozen men to help us sink the first shaft,\" proposed Tom.  \"That's where I feel like a fool,\" muttered Ferrers.  \"I haven't a blessed dollar to put in as capital.\"  \"We'll take your honesty for a good deal in the way of capital, Jim,\" Tom hinted cheerfully.  \"Harry, you might get out the transit, the tape, markers and other things.  If we stake out a claim we'll do it so accurately that there can be no fight, afterward, as to the real boundaries of our claim.\"  \"What shall we call the claim?\" inquired Hazelton, as he came back with the surveying outfit.  \"Suppose we wait until the assay is done, and find out whether the claim is worth anything better than a bad name,\" laughed Tom.  The crucibles were in the furnace now, and a hot flame going. Jim Ferrers sat by, puffing reflectively at his pipe as he squatted on the ground nearby.  Alf Drew was smoking, too, somewhere, but he had taken his offensive cigarettes to some place of concealment.  Harry anxiously watched the course of the sun, while Tom kept his gaze, most of the time, near the furnace.  \"Come on, Harry!\" called Tom at last.  \"We'd rake out the crucibles. My, but I hope the buttons are going to be worth weighing.\"  A withering blast of hot air reached the young engineers as the oven door of the portable assay furnace was thrown open.  The crucibles were raked out and set in the air to cool.  \"Would fanning the crucibles with my hat do any good?\" asked Hazelton eagerly.  \"Some,\" yawned Tom, \"if you're impatient.\"  Reade strolled off under the trees, whistling softly to himself. Jim Ferrers smoked a little faster, the only sign he gave of the anxiety that was consuming him.  Harry frequently sprang to his feet, walked up and down rapidly, then sat down again.  Two or three times Hazelton burned his fingers, testing to see whether the crucibles were cool enough to handle.  At last Tom strolled back, his gaze on the dial of his watch.  \"Cool enough for a look, now, I think,\" Reade announced.  Harry bounded eagerly toward the crucibles, feeling them with his hands.  \"Plenty cool enough,\" he reported.  \"But how did you guess, Tom?\"  \"I didn't guess,\" Reade laughed.  \"I've timed the crucibles before this, and I know to a minute how long it ought to take.\"  \"What a chump I am!\" growled Harry, in contempt for self.  \"I never think of such things as that.\"  Tom now carefully emptied the crucibles.  In the bottom of each was found a tiny bead of half-lustrous metal, which miners and assayers term the \"button.\"  \"The real stuff!\" glowed Hazelton.  \"Ye-es,\" said Tom slowly.  \"But the next question is whether the buttons will weigh enough to hint at good-paying ore.  Even at that, these buttons are only from surface ore.\"  \"But the ore underneath is always better than the surface ore,\" contended Hazelton.  \"Usually is,\" Tom corrected.  \"If we get good enough results from this assay it will at least be worth while to stake a claim and work it for a while.\"  Harry waited with feverish impatience.  Tom Reade, on the other hand, was almost provokingly slow and cool as he carefully adjusted the sensitive assaying balance and finally weighed the buttons. Then he did some slow, painstaking calculating.  At last he looked up.  \"Well, sir?\" asked Jim Ferrers.  \"From this surface ore,\" replied Tom calmly, \"twenty-eight dollars in gold to the ton; silver, six dollars.\"  \"That's good enough for me!\" cried Ferrers, his eyes brightening.  \"Wow! Whoop!  Oh---whee!\" vented Harry, then ran and snatched up the surveying transit.  \"Yes; I guess we'd better go along and do our staking,\" assented Tom.  \"And I'll be ready at daylight to file the claim at Dugout City,\" promised Jim.  \"I won't sleep until I've seen our papers filed.\"  \"You'll file the claim in your own name, Jim,\" Tom suddenly suggested.  \"No; I won't,\" retorted Ferrers.  \"I'll play squarely.\"  \"That will be doing squarely by us, Jim,\" Tom continued.  \"We don't want to use up our claim privileges on one stretch of Nevada dirt.\"  If we can find claims enough we'll stake out three, and then pool them all together in a gentlemen's agreement.\"  \"That's a good deal of trust you're showing in me, gentlemen,\" said Jim huskily.  \"Never mind, Jim,\" returned Reade quietly.  \"You can show us, you know, that we didn't waste our confidence.\"  While they were still talking the three came in sight of the ridge.  \"Look there!\" gasped Harry suddenly.  \"Dolph Gage and his tin-horn crowd!\" flared Jim Ferrers, in anger. \"Hang the fellow!  This time I'll-----\"  \"Stop fingering your rifle, Jim,\" ordered Reade.  \"Remember, nothing like fighting!  If they haven't filed notice in due form on the claim, we're safe yet.  If they have-----\"  \"Look!\" hissed Ferrers.  At that moment Dolph Gage could be seen nailing a sheet of white paper to a board driven into the soil.  \"We've staked what you want, I reckon!\" bellowed Gage laconically. \"Staked it in due form, too, if you want to know.\"  \"I guess we've lost that claim,\" said Tom slowly.  \"Have we?\" hissed Jim Ferrers.     CHAPTER VII  READY TO HANDLE THE PICK   \"Keep off this ground!\" yelled Dolph Gage, snatching up his rifle.  \"Stop that nonsense,\" Tom bellowed back in his own lusty voice.  \"You've no right on this ground.\"  \"Yes, we have, if you want to know,\" Tom continued.  \"You haven't filed your papers at Dugout yet.\"  \"How do you know we haven't?\"  \"I'll take a chance on it,\" smiled Tom amiably, as he and his companions continued to walk nearer.  Jim Ferrers held his rifle so that it would take him but an instant to swing it into action if the need came.  \"If you've filed your papers for this claim\" Tom continued, lowering his voice somewhat as they drew nearer to the four rascals.  \"Have you any such paper to show us?\"  \"Perhaps not,\" growled Dolph Gage, his evil eyes seeming to shoot flame.  \"But we've got our notice of claim nailed up here.  We got it here first, and now you can't file any mining entry at Dugout City for this bit o' ground.\"  \"Not if your notice is written in the prescribed language,\" Tom admitted.  \"Well, it is.  Now, keep off this ground, or we'll shoot you so full of holes that you'll all three pass for tolerable lead mines!\"  \"If you don't shoot and make a good job of it,\" Reade insisted, \"I'm going to look over your notice of claim and see whether it's worded in a way that will hold in law.\"  \"Drop 'em, boys!  Don't let 'em near!\" roared Dolph Gage, swinging his rifle as though to bring it to his shoulder.  But Jim Ferrers had forestalled him.  The guide was gazing at his enemy through his rifle sights.  \"Drop your weapon, Dolph Gage, and do it blazing quick, or I'll shoot you where you stand!\" sounded Jim's voice, low and businesslike. \"If any of you other galoots tries to raise his weapon I'll turn and drop him.\"  As Jim Ferrers had a reputation in Nevada as a rifle shot the others hesitated, then let their rifles drop to the ground.  \"Hold them to their present good intentions, Jim,\" said Tom, with a smile, as he continued to move forward.  \"Now, Mr. Gage---I believe that's your name let me see what kind of notice you know how to draw up.\"  \"There 'tis,\" muttered Dolph sullenly, pointing to the board.  Tom read the notice through under his breath, word by word.  \"You've done this sort of thing before, I guess, Gage,\" said Reade quietly.  \"You bet I have.  Find it all reg'lar, too, don't you?\"  \"As nearly as I can tell, it is,\" agreed Tom.  \"And the claim is ours.\"  \"It's yours if you file the formal papers soon enough.\"  \"They'll be filed first thing tomorrow morning,\" grunted Dolph Gage.  \"Now, try a two-step off the dirt that goes with this claim.\"  \"Not until I've seen the borders that you claim,\" Tom rejoined.  \"Why!\" demanded Gage cunningly.  \"Going to start your claim right at the corners of ours.\"  \"If you'll pardon me,\" Reade smiled, \"I don't believe I'll tell you anything about my intentions.\"  \"Maybe you think this claim is a pretty valuable one,\" Gage insinuated.  \"I didn't say so.\"  \"But you would have staked if we hadn't done it first.\"  \"That's what you've got to guess,\" smiled Reade.  \"Say, now you've lost this claim, tell us some thing straight, won't youth begged Dolph.  \"Tell you something straight?\" repeated Tom.  \"Certainly.  I'll tell you something just as straight as I know how,\"  \"Well,\" he said, at last, \"you said you'd tell us something straight.\"  \"And so I will,\" laughed Tom.  \"It's just this: Go to blazes!\"  \"Come, now, don't get fresh, kid!\" warned Dolph angrily.  \"If we're going to be on neighboring claims you may find it a heap to your advantage to use us about half-way decent and polite.\"  Tom didn't answer at once.  He was rapidly covering the statement of location from the paper nailed to the board.  \"You fellows picked up a lot of ore stuff around here,\" continued Dolph Gage.  \"Yes?\" Tom inquired.  \"Did you see us?\"  \"Yes, and we also saw you making an assay.\"  \"You did.\"  \"Of course we did.  Say, friend, how did that assay come out?\"  \"It came out of the furnace,\" Tom answered still writing.  \"'Course it did.  But say, how did that assay read?\"  \"Read?\" repeated Tom.  \"Why, bless me, I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#0)"],["body","YOUNG ENGINEERS IN MEXICO  or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers  by  H.

Conclusion     CHAPTER I  THE LAND OF GOLDEN EGGS   Luis Montez, mine owner, stood on the broad veranda in front of his handsome home, looking out over the country sweeping away to the eastward.  \"Gentlemen, you are in a land of golden promise,\" began Senor Montez, with a smile and a bow.  \"I should call it more than promise. Why not?  My beloved country, Mexico, has been shipping gold to the world ever since the days of Montezuma.\"  \"Yes; in a mineral sense Mexico has truly a golden history,\" nodded Tom Reade, one of the engineers to whom Montez was speaking.  \"And a golden history in every sense,\" added Senor Montez, with a quick rush of patriotism.  \"Mexico is the finest country on earth.  And, though we are neither as numerous in population, or as progressive as your own great country, still Mexico has greater possibilities than the United States.\"  Tom was too polite to argue that point.  And Harry Hazelton, whom a seventy-mile ride in an automobile over dusty roads, that day, had rendered very drowsy, didn't consider an argument worth while.  \"Mexico has almost incredible natural wealth,\" Montez went on, his voice soft and purring, his eyes glowing with something that might have passed for pride.  \"Yet, through all the centuries that white men have been here, I am confident that not one per cent. of the country's natural resources has yet been taken from the ground.  Enough wealth lies at man's beck and call to change the balance of power between the nations of the world.  I have been in your great city, New York.  It is a place of tremendous wealth.  Yet, within ten years, gold enough can be taken from the ground within a radius of twenty miles of here to buy the whole great city of New York at any sane valuation.\"  \"That purchase would require billions of dollars,\" broke in the practical Hazelton.  \"But the wealth is here,\" insisted Senor Montez, still smiling. \"Truly, _caballeros_, as I have told you, this is the land of golden--\"  Again the Mexican paused, eloquently.  \"The land of golden eggs?\" suggested Harry.  For an instant there was a flash in the Mexican's eyes.  Then the friendly smile reappeared.  \"Of course, you jest, senor,\" he replied, pleasantly.  \"Not at all, Senor Montez,\" Hazelton assured him.  \"When gold is so plentiful that it can be picked up everywhere, there must be a goose at hand that lays golden eggs.  Eggs are among the most common things that we have.  When gold nuggets are as large and as abundant as eggs then we may properly call them golden eggs.\"  Senor Montez, flipped away the cigar that he had finished, and reached for another.  This he carefully cut at the end, lighting it with graceful, elegant deliberation.  The Mexican was a distinguished-looking man above medium height.  A little past forty years of age, he possessed all the agility of a boy of twenty. Frequently his sudden, agile movements indicated the possession of unusual strength.  Dark, like most of his countrymen, constant exposure to the tropical sun had made his face almost the color of mahogany.  His carriage was erect, every movement instinctive with grace.  Clad in a white linen suit, with white shoes, he wore on his head a Panama hat of fine texture and weave.  The house of which the broad veranda was a part, was a low, two-story affair in stone, painted white.  Through the middle of the house extended the drive-way leading into a large court in which a fountain played.  Around the upper story of the house a balcony encircled the court and around the windows there were also small balconies.  Many servants, most of them male, ministered to the wants of those in the house.  There were gardeners, hostlers, drivers, chauffeurs and other employs, making a veritable colony of help that was housed in small, low white houses well to the rear.  Some thirty acres of grounds had been rendered beautiful by the work of engineers, architects and gardeners.  Nature, on this estate, had been forced, for the natural soil was stony and sterile, in keeping with the mountains and the shallow valleys in this part of the little and seldom-heard-of state of Bonista.  To the eastward lay, at a distance of some two miles, one of the sources of Senor Montez's wealth _El Sombrero_ Mine, producing some silver and much more gold.  At least so the owner claimed.  It was Senor Luis Montez himself who had gone to the nearest railway station, seventy miles distant, and there had made himself known, that forenoon, to the two young engineers from the United States.  Tom and Harry had come to _El Sombrero_ at the invitation of Montez. After many careful inquiries as to their reputation and standing in their home country, Montez had engaged the young men as engineers to help him develop his great mine.  Nor had he hesitated to pay the terms they had named--one thousand dollars, gold, per month, for each, and all expenses paid.  Over mountain trails, through the day, much of the way had of necessity been made slowly.  Wherever the dusty, irregular roads had permitted greater speed, the swarthy Mexican who had served Senor Montez as chauffeur on the trip had opened wide on the speed. At the end of their long automobile ride Tom and Harry fairly ached from the jolting they had received.  \"There are other beautiful features of this gr-r-rand country of mine,\" the Mexican mine owner continued, lighting his second cigar.  \"I am a noble, you know, Senor Tomaso.  In my veins flows the noble blood of the hidalgos of good old Spain.  My ancestors came here two hundred and fifty years ago, and ever since, ours has been truly a Mexican family that has preserved all of the most worthy traditions of the old Spanish nobles.  We are a proud race, a conquering one.  In this part of Bonista, I, like my ancestors, rule like a war lord.\"  \"You don't have much occupation at that game, do you, senor?\" Tom asked, with an innocent smile.  \"That--that--game?\" repeated Senor Montez, with a puzzled look at his young guest.  \"The game of war lord,\" Reade explained.  \"Mexico is not often at war, is she?\"  \"Not since she was forced to fight your country, Senor Tomaso, as you help to remind me,\" pursued Montez, without a trace of offense.  \"Though I was educated in your country, I confess that, at times, your language still baffles me.  What I meant to say was not 'war lord,' but--but--\"  \"Over lord?\" suggested Reade, politely.  \"Ah, yes!  Perhaps that better expresses what I mean.  In Mexico we have laws, senor, to be sure.  But they are not for _caballeros_ like myself--not for men who can boast of the blood of Spanish hidalgos.  I am master over these people for many miles around. Absolute master!  Think you any judge would dare sign a process against me, and send _peon_ officers of the law to interfere with me?  No!  As I tell you, I, Luis Montez, am the sole master here among the mountains.  We have laws for the _peons_ (working class), but I--I make my own laws.\"  \"Does it take much of your time, may I ask?\"  \"Does what take much of my time?\" repeated Senor Montez, again looking puzzled.  \"Law making,\" explained Tom Reade.  Montez shot a swift look at the young engineer.  He wondered if the American were making fun of him.  But Reade's face looked so simple and kindly, his eyes so full of interest, that the Mexican dismissed the thought.  \"I spend no time in making laws--unless I need them,\" the Mexican continued.  \"I make laws only as the need arises, and I make them to suit myself.  I interpret the laws as I please for my own pleasure or interests.  Do you comprehend?\"  \"I think so,\" Tom nodded.  \"Many of the big corporations in my country do about the same thing, though the privilege has not yet been extended to individuals in the United States.\"  \"Here,\" continued the mine owner, earnestly, \"no man disputes my will.  That, of itself, is law.  Here no man sues me, for if he attempted to do so, he would go to prison and remain there. If I tell a man to leave these mountains, he does so, for otherwise he would never leave them.  If a man annoys me, and I tell one of my trusted servants to attend to my enemy--then that enemy never troubles me further.\"  \"That is interesting--it's so simple and effective!\" cried Tom, pretended enthusiasm glowing in his eyes.  \"Say, but that's practical! A man annoys you, and you send a servant to tell him to stop. Then he stops.\"  \"Because my enemy also vanishes, you understand,\" smiled Senor Luis, indulgently.  \"But doesn't the governor of Bonista ever hear of the disappearances?\" suggested Reade, very casually.  \"What if he does?\" demanded Don Luis, snapping his fingers gayly. \"Are not his excellency, the governor, and I, the best of friends? Would he give heed to rumors against me, brought by evil-tongued men?  Oh, no!  _El gobernador_ (the governor) has, at times, even kindly lent me his troops to make sure that an enemy of mine doesn't travel too far.  No!  I tell you, Senor Tomaso, I am over lord here.  I am the law in these mountains.\"  \"It must be a great comfort, Don Luis--if you have many enemies,\" suggested Tom Reade smilingly.  \"Ah, no!  I have"]]]
