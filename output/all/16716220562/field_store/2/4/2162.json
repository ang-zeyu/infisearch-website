As to the other face, the one always invisible, it has naturally 354 hours of absolute night, tempered only by \"the pale light that falls from the stars.\" This phenomenon is due solely to the peculiarity that the movements of rotation and revolution are accomplished in rigorously equal periods, a phenomenon which, according to Cassini and Herschel, is common to the satellites of Jupiter, and, very probably to the other satellites.  Some well-disposed but rather unyielding minds did not quite understand at first how, if the moon invariably shows the same face to the earth during her revolution, she describes one turn round herself in the same period of time. To such it was answered--\"Go into your dining-room, and turn round the table so as always to keep your face towards the centre; when your circular walk is ended you will have described one circle round yourselves, since your eye will have successively traversed every point of the room. Well, then, the room is the heavens, the table is the earth, and you are the moon!\"  And they go away delighted with the comparison.  Thus, then, the moon always presents the same face to the earth; still, to be quite exact, it should be added that in consequence of certain fluctuations from north to south and from west to east, called libration, she shows rather more than the half of her disc, about 0.57.  When the ignoramuses knew as much as the director of the Cambridge Observatory about the moon's movement of rotation they began to make themselves uneasy about her movement of revolution round the earth, and twenty scientific reviews quickly gave them the information they wanted. They then learnt that the firmament, with its infinite stars, may be looked upon as a vast dial upon which the moon moves, indicating the time to all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is in this movement that the Queen of Night shows herself in her different phases, that she is full when she is in opposition with the sun--that is to say, when the three bodies are on a line with each other, the earth being in the centre; that the moon is new when she is in conjunction with the sun--that is to say, when she is between the sun and the earth; lastly, that the moon is in her first or last quarter when she makes, with the sun and the earth, a right angle of which she occupies the apex.  Some perspicacious Yankees inferred in consequence that eclipses could only take place at the periods of conjunction or opposition, and their reasoning was just. In conjunction the moon can eclipse the sun, whilst in opposition it is the earth that can eclipse him in her turn; and the reason these eclipses do not happen twice in a lunar month is because the plane upon which the moon moves is elliptical like that of the earth.  As to the height which the Queen of Night can attain above the horizon, the letter from the Observatory of Cambridge contained all that can be said about it. Every one knew that this height varies according to the latitude of the place where the observation is taken. But the only zones of the globe where the moon reaches her zenith--that is to say, where she is directly above the heads of the spectators--are necessarily comprised between the 28th parallels and the equator. Hence the important recommendation given to attempt the experiment upon some point in this part of the globe, in order that the projectile may be hurled perpendicularly, and may thus more quickly escape the attraction of gravitation. This was a condition essential to the success of the enterprise, and public opinion was much exercised thereupon.  As to the line followed by the moon in her revolution round the earth, the Observatory of Cambridge had demonstrated to the most ignorant that it is an ellipse of which the earth occupies one of the foci. These elliptical orbits are common to all the planets as well as to all the satellites, and rational mechanism rigorously proves that it could not be otherwise. It was clearly understood that when at her apogee the moon was farthest from the earth, and when at her perigee she was nearest to our planet.  This, therefore, was what every American knew whether he wished to or no, and what no one could decently be ignorant of. But if these true principles rapidly made their way, certain illusive fears and many errors were with difficulty cleared away.  Some worthy people maintained, for instance, that the moon was an ancient comet, which, whilst travelling along its elongated orbit round the sun, passed near to the earth, and was retained in her circle of attraction. The drawing-room astronomers pretended to explain thus the burnt aspect of the moon, a misfortune of which they accused the sun. Only when they were told to notice that comets have an atmosphere, and that the moon has little or none, they did not know what to answer.  Others belonging to the class of \"Shakers\" manifested certain fears about the moon; they had heard that since the observations made in the times of the Caliphs her movement of revolution had accelerated in a certain proportion; they thence very logically concluded that an acceleration of movement must correspond to a diminution in the distance between the two bodies, and that this double effect going on infinitely the moon would one day end by falling into the earth. However, they were obliged to reassure themselves and cease to fear for future generations when they were told that according to the calculations of Laplace, an illustrious French mathematician, this acceleration of movement was restricted within very narrow limits, and that a proportional diminution will follow it. Thus the equilibrium of the solar world cannot be disturbed in future centuries.  Lastly there was the superstitious class of ignoramuses to be dealt with; these are not content with being ignorant; they know what does not exist, and about the moon they know a great deal. Some of them considered her disc to be a polished mirror by means of which people might see themselves from different points on the earth, and communicate their thoughts to one another. Others pretended that out of 1,000 new moons 950 had brought some notable change, such as cataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, deluges, &c.; they therefore believed in the mysterious influence of the Queen of Night on human destinies; they think that every Selenite is connected by some sympathetic tie with each inhabitant of the earth; they pretend, with Dr. Mead, that she entirely governs the vital system--that boys are born during the new moon and girls during her last quarter, &c., &c. But at last it became necessary to give up these vulgar errors, to come back to truth; and if the moon, stripped of her influence, lost her prestige in the minds of courtesans of every power, if some turned their backs on her, the immense majority were in her favour. As to the Yankees, they had no other ambition than that of taking possession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant upon its highest summit the star-spangled banner of the United States of America.     CHAPTER VII.  THE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL.   The Cambridge Observatory had, in its memorable letter of October 7th, treated the question from an astronomical point of view--the mechanical point had still to be treated. It was then that the practical difficulties would have seemed insurmountable to any other country but America; but there they were looked upon as play.  President Barbicane had, without losing any time, nominated a working committee in the heart of the Gun Club. This committee was in three sittings to elucidate the three great questions of the cannon, the projectile, and the powder. It was composed of four members very learned upon these matters. Barbicane had the casting vote, and with him were associated General Morgan, Major Elphinstone, and, lastly, the inevitable J.T. Maston, to whom were confided the functions of secretary.  On the 8th of October the committee met at President Barbicane's house, No. 3, Republican-street; as it was important that the stomach should not trouble so important a debate, the four members of the Gun Club took their seats at a table covered with sandwiches and teapots. J.T. Maston immediately screwed his pen on to his steel hook and the business began.  Barbicane opened the meeting as follows:--  \"Dear colleagues,\" said he, \"we have to solve one of the more important problems in ballistics--that greatest of sciences which treats of the movement of projectiles--that is to say, of bodies hurled into space by some power of impulsion and then left to themselves.\"  \"Oh, ballistics, ballistics!\" cried J.T. Maston in a voice of emotion.  \"Perhaps,\" continued Barbicane, \"the most logical thing would be to consecrate this first meeting to discussing the engine.\"  \"Certainly,\" answered General Morgan.  \"Nevertheless,\" continued Barbicane, \"after mature deliberation, it seems to me that the question of the projectile ought to precede that of the cannon, and that the dimensions of the latter ought to depend upon the dimensions of the former.\"  J.T. Maston here interrupted the president, and was heard with the attention which his magnificent past career deserved.  \"My dear friends,\" said he in an inspired tone, \"our president is right to give the question of the projectile the precedence of every other; the cannon-ball we mean to hurl at the moon will be our messenger, our ambassador, and I ask your permission to regard it from an entirely moral point of view.\"  This new way of looking at a projectile excited the curiosity of the members of the committee; they therefore listened attentively to the words of J.T. Maston.  \"My dear colleagues,\" he continued, \"I will be brief. I will lay aside the material projectile--the projectile that kills--in order to take up the mathematical projectile--the moral projectile. A cannon-ball is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12901"],["title","The Moon-Voyage (#7)"],["body","me the most brilliant manifestation of human power, and by creating it man has approached nearest to the Creator!\"  \"Hear, hear!\" said Major Elphinstone.  \"In fact,\" cried the orator, \"if God has made the stars and the planets, man has made the cannon-ball--that criterion of terrestrial speed--that reduction of bodies wandering in space which are really nothing but projectiles. Let Providence claim the speed of electricity, light, the stars, comets, planets, satellites, sound, and wind! But ours is the speed of the cannon-ball--a hundred times greater than that of trains and the fastest horses!\"  J.T. Maston was inspired; his accents became quite lyrical as he chanted the hymn consecrated to the projectile.  \"Would you like figures?\" continued he; \"here are eloquent ones. Take the simple 24 pounder; though it moves 80,000 times slower than electricity, 64,000 times slower than light, 76 times slower than the earth in her movement of translation round the sun, yet when it leaves the cannon it goes quicker than sound; it goes at the rate of 14 miles a minute, 840 miles an hour, 20,100 miles a day--that is to say, at the speed of the points of the equator in the globe's movement of rotation, 7,336,500 miles a year. It would therefore take 11 days to get to the moon, 12 years to get to the sun, 360 years to reach Neptune, at the limits of the solar world. That is what this modest cannon-ball, the work of our hands, can do! What will it be, therefore, when, with twenty times that speed, we shall hurl it with a rapidity of seven miles a second? Ah! splendid shot! superb projectile! I like to think you will be received up there with the honours due to a terrestrial ambassador!\"  Cheers greeted this brilliant peroration, and J.T. Maston, overcome with emotion, sat down amidst the felicitations of his colleagues.  \"And now,\" said Barbicane, \"that we have given some time to poetry, let us proceed to facts.\"  \"We are ready,\" answered the members of the committee as they each demolished half-a-dozen sandwiches.  \"You know what problem it is we have to solve,\" continued the president; \"it is that of endowing a projectile with a speed of 12,000 yards per second. I have every reason to believe that we shall succeed, but at present let us see what speeds we have already obtained; General Morgan can edify us upon that subject.\"  \"So much the more easily,\" answered the general, \"because during the war I was a member of the Experiment Commission. The 100-pound cannon of Dahlgren, with a range of 5,000 yards, gave their projectiles an initial speed of 500 yards a second.\"  \"Yes; and the Rodman Columbiad?\" (the Americans gave the name of \"Columbiad\" to their enormous engines of destruction) asked the president.  \"The Rodman Columbiad, tried at Fort Hamilton, near New York, hurled a projectile, weighing half a ton, a distance of six miles, with a speed of 800 yards a second, a result which neither Armstrong nor Palliser has obtained in England.\"  \"Englishmen are nowhere!\" said J.T. Maston, pointing his formidable steel hook eastward.  \"Then,\" resumed Barbicane, \"a speed of 800 yards is the maximum obtained at present.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Morgan.  \"I might add, however,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"that if my mortar had not been blown up--\"  \"Yes, but it was blown up,\" replied Barbicane with a benevolent gesture. \"We must take the speed of 800 yards for a starting point. We must keep till another meeting the discussion of the means used to produce this speed; allow me to call your attention to the dimensions which our projectile must have. Of course it must be something very different to one of half a ton weight.\"  \"Why?\" asked the major.  \"Because,\" quickly answered J.T. Maston, \"it must be large enough to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, supposing there are any.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"and for another reason still more important.\"  \"What do you mean, Barbicane?\" asked the major.  \"I mean that it is not enough to send up a projectile and then to think no more about it; we must follow it in its transit.\"  \"What?\" said the general, slightly surprised at the proposition.  \"Certainly,\" replied Barbicane, like a man who knew what he was saying, \"or our experiment will be without result.\"  \"But then,\" replied the major, \"you will have to give the projectile enormous dimensions.\"  \"No. Please grant me your attention. You know that optical instruments have acquired great perfection; certain telescopes increase objects six thousand, and bring the moon to within a distance of forty miles. Now at that distance objects sixty feet square are perfectly visible. The power of penetration of the telescope has not been increased, because that power is only exercised to the detriment of their clearness, and the moon, which is only a reflecting mirror, does not send a light intense enough for the telescopes to increase objects beyond that limit.\"  \"Very well, then, what do you mean to do?\" asked the general. \"Do you intend giving a diameter of sixty feet to your projectile?\"  \"No.\"  \"You are not going to take upon yourself the task of making the moon more luminous?\"  \"I am, though.\"  \"That's rather strong!\" exclaimed Maston.  \"Yes, but simple,\" answered Barbicane. \"If I succeed in lessening the density of the atmosphere which the moon's light traverses, shall I not render that light more intense?\"  \"Evidently.\"  \"In order to obtain that result I shall only have to establish my telescope upon some high mountain. We can do that.\"  \"I give in,\" answered the major; \"you have such a way of simplifying things! What enlargement do you hope to obtain thus?\"  \"One of 48,000 times, which will bring the moon within five miles only, and objects will only need a diameter of nine feet.\"  \"Perfect!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston; \"then our projectile will have a diameter of nine feet?\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"Allow me to inform you, however,\" returned Major Elphinstone, \"that its weight will still be--\"  \"Oh, major!\" answered Barbicane, \"before discussing its weight allow me to tell you that our forefathers did marvels in that way. Far be it from me to pretend that ballistics have not progressed, but it is well to know that in the Middle Ages surprising results were obtained, I dare affirm, even more surprising than ours.\"  \"Justify your statement,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.  \"Nothing is easier,\" answered Barbicane; \"I can give you some examples. At the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II., in 1453, they hurled stone bullets that weighed 1,900 lbs.; at Malta, in the time of its knights, a certain cannon of Fort Saint Elme hurled projectiles weighing 2,500 lbs. According to a French historian, under Louis XI. a mortar hurled a bomb of 500 lbs. only; but that bomb, fired at the Bastille, a place where mad men imprisoned wise ones, fell at Charenton, where wise men imprison mad ones.\"  \"Very well,\" said J.T. Maston.  \"Since, what have we seen, after all? The Armstrong cannons hurl projectiles of 500 lbs., and the Rodman Columbiads projectiles of half a ton! It seems, then, that if projectiles have increased in range they have lost in weight. Now, if we turn our efforts in that direction, we must succeed with the progress of the science in doubling the weight of the projectiles of Mahomet II. and the Knights of Malta.\"  \"That is evident,\" answered the major; \"but what metal do you intend to employ for your own projectile?\"  \"Simply cast-iron,\" said General Morgan.  \"Cast-iron!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston disdainfully, \"that's very common for a bullet destined to go to the moon.\"  \"Do not let us exaggerate, my honourable friend,\" answered Morgan; \"cast-iron will be sufficient.\"  \"Then,\" replied Major Elphinstone, \"as the weight of the projectile is in proportion to its volume, a cast-iron bullet, measuring nine feet in diameter, will still be frightfully heavy.\"  \"Yes, if it be solid, but not if it be hollow,\" said Barbicane.  \"Hollow!--then it will be an obus?\"  \"In which we can put despatches,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"and specimens of our terrestrial productions.\"  \"Yes, an obus,\" answered Barbicane; \"that is what it must be; a solid bullet of 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 lbs., a weight evidently too great; however, as it is necessary to give the projectile a certain stability, I propose to give it a weight of 20,000 lbs.\"  \"What will be the thickness of the metal?\" asked the major.  \"If we follow the usual proportions,\" replied Morgan, \"a diameter of 800 inches demands sides two feet thick at least.\"  \"That would be much too thick,\" answered Barbicane; \"we do not want a projectile to pierce armour-plate; it only needs sides strong enough to resist the pressure of the powder-gas. This, therefore, is the problem:--What thickness ought an iron obus to have in order to weigh only 20,000 lbs.? Our clever calculator, Mr. Maston, will tell us at once.\"  \"Nothing is easier,\" replied the honourable secretary.  So saying, he traced some algebraical signs on the paper, amongst which n^2 and x^2 frequently appeared. He even seemed to extract from them a certain cubic root, and said--  \"The sides must be hardly two inches thick.\"  \"Will that be sufficient?\" asked the major doubtfully.  \"No,\" answered the president, \"certainly not.\"  \"Then what must be done?\" resumed Elphinstone, looking puzzled.  \"We must use another metal instead of cast-iron.\"  \"Brass?\" suggested Morgan.  \"No; that is too heavy too, and I have something better than that to propose.\"  \"What?\" asked the major.  \"Aluminium,\" answered Barbicane.  \"Aluminium!\" cried all the three colleagues of the president.  \"Certainly, my friends. You know that an illustrious French chemist, Henry St. Claire Deville, succeeded in 1854 in obtaining aluminium in a compact mass. This precious metal possesses the whiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of iron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass; it is easily wrought, and is very widely distributed in nature, as aluminium forms the"]]]
