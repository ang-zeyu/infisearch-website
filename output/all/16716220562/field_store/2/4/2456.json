The chronic diarrhoea became the scourge of the army.  Corinth became one vast hospital.  Almost the whole army attended the sick call every morning. All the water courses went dry, and we used water out of filthy pools.  Halleck was advancing; we had to fortify Corinth.  A vast army, Grant, Buell, Halleck, Sherman, all were advancing on Corinth.  Our troops were in no condition to fight.  In fact, they had seen enough of this miserable yet tragic farce.  They were ready to ring down the curtain, put out the footlights and go home.  They loved the Union anyhow, and were always opposed to this war.  But breathe softly the name of Bragg. It had more terror than the advancing hosts of Halleck's army.  The shot and shell would come tearing through our ranks.  Every now and then a soldier was killed or wounded, and we thought what \"magnificent\" folly. Death was welcome.  Halleck's whole army of blue coats had no terror now. When we were drawn up in line of battle, a detail of one-tenth of the army was placed in our rear to shoot us down if we ran.  No pack of hounds under the master's lash, or body of penitentiary convicts were ever under greater surveillance.  We were tenfold worse than slaves; our morale was a thing of the past; the glory of war and the pride of manhood had been sacrificed upon Bragg's tyrannical holocaust.  But enough of this.   ROWLAND SHOT TO DEATH  One morning I went over to the 23rd Tennessee Regiment on a visit to Captain Gray Armstrong and Colonel Jim Niel, both of whom were glad to see me, as we were old ante-bellum friends.  While at Colonel Niel's marquee I saw a detail of soldiers bring out a man by the name of Rowland, whom they were going to shoot to death with musketry, by order of a court-martial, for desertion.  I learned that he had served out the term for which he had originally volunteered, had quit our army and joined that of the Yankees, and was captured with Prentiss' Yankee brigade at Shiloh.  He was being hauled to the place of execution in a wagon, sitting on an old gun box, which was to be his coffin.  When they got to the grave, which had been dug the day before, the water had risen in it, and a soldier was baling it out.  Rowland spoke up and said, \"Please hand me a drink of that water, as I want to drink out of my own grave so the boys will talk about it when I am dead, and remember Rowland.\"  They handed him the water and he drank all there was in the bucket, and handing it back asked them to please hand him a little more, as he had heard that water was very scarce in hell, and it would be the last he would ever drink.  He was then carried to the death post, and there he began to cut up jack generally.  He began to curse Bragg, Jeff. Davis, and the Southern Confederacy, and all the rebels at a terrible rate. He was simply arrogant and very insulting.  I felt that he deserved to die.  He said he would show the rebels how a Union man could die. I do not know what all he did say.  When the shooting detail came up, he went of his own accord and knelt down at the post.  The Captain commanding the squad gave the command, \"Ready, aim, fire!\" and Rowland tumbled over on his side.  It was the last of Rowland.   KILLING A YANKEE SHARPSHOOTER  In our immediate front, at Corinth, Mississippi, our men were being picked off by sharpshooters, and a great many were killed, but no one could tell where the shots came from.  At one particular post it was sure death.  Every detail that had been sent to this post for a week had been killed.  In distributing the detail this post fell to Tom Webb and myself.  They were bringing off a dead boy just as we went on duty. Colonel George C. Porter, of the 6th Tennessee, warned us to keep a good lookout.  We took our stands.  A minnie ball whistled right by my head. I don't think it missed me an eighth of an inch.  Tom had sat down on an old chunk of wood, and just as he took his seat, zip! a ball took the chunk of wood.  Tom picked it up and began laughing at our tight place. Happening to glance up towards the tree tops, I saw a smoke rising above a tree, and about the same time I saw a Yankee peep from behind the tree, up among the bushes.  I quickly called Tom's attention to it, and pointed out the place.  We could see his ramrod as he handled it while loading his gun; saw him raise his gun, as we thought, to put a cap on it. Tom in the meantime had lain flat on his belly and placed his gun across the chunk he had been sitting on.  I had taken a rest for my gun by the side of a sapling, and both of us had dead aim at the place where the Yankee was.  Finally we saw him sort o' peep round the tree, and we moved about a little so that he might see us, and as we did so, the Yankee stepped out in full view, and bang, bang!  Tom and I had both shot. We saw that Yankee tumble out like a squirrel.  It sounded like distant thunder when that Yankee struck the ground.  We heard the Yankees carry him off.  One thing I am certain of, and that is, not another Yankee went up that tree that day, and Colonel George C. Porter complimented Tom and I very highly on our success.  This is where I first saw a jack o'lantern (ignis fatui).  That night, while Tom and I were on our posts, we saw a number of very dim lights, which seemed to be in motion.  At first we took them to be Yankees moving about with lights.  Whenever we could get a shot we would blaze away.  At last one got up very close, and passed right between Tom and I.  I don't think I was ever more scared in my life.  My hair stood on end like the quills of the fretful porcupine; I could not imagine what on earth it was.  I took it to be some hellish machination of a Yankee trick.  I did not know whether to run or stand, until I heard Tom laugh and say, \"Well, well, that's a jack o'lantern.\"   COLONEL FIELD  Before proceeding further with these memoirs, I desire to give short sketches of two personages with whom we were identified and closely associated until the winding up of the ball.  The first is Colonel Hume R. Field.  Colonel Field was born a soldier.  I have read many descriptions of Stonewall Jackson.  Colonel Field was his exact counterpart.  They looked somewhat alike, spoke alike, and alike were trained military soldiers.  The War Department at Richmond made a grand mistake in not making him a \"commander of armies.\"  He was not a brilliant man; could not talk at all.  He was a soldier.  His conversation was yea and nay.  But when you could get \"yes, sir,\" and \"no, sir,\" out of him his voice was as soft and gentle as a maid's when she says \"yes\" to her lover.  Fancy, if you please, a man about thirty years old, a dark skin, made swarthy by exposure to sun and rain, very black eyes that seemed to blaze with a gentle luster.  I never saw him the least excited in my life.  His face was a face of bronze.  His form was somewhat slender, but when you looked at him you saw at the first glance that this would be a dangerous man in a ground skuffle, a foot race, or a fight.  There was nothing repulsive or forbidding or even domineering in his looks.  A child or a dog would make up with him on first sight.  He knew not what fear was, or the meaning of the word fear. He had no nerves, or rather, has a rock or tree any nerves?  You might as well try to shake the nerves of a rock or tree as those of Colonel Field. He was the bravest man, I think, I ever knew.  Later in the war he was known by every soldier in the army; and the First Tennessee Regiment, by his manipulations, became the regiment to occupy \"tight places.\" He knew his men.  When he struck the Yankee line they felt the blow. He had, himself, set the example, and so trained his regiment that all the armies in the world could not whip it.  They might kill every man in it, is true, but they would die game to the last man.  His men all loved him.  He was no disciplinarian, but made his regiment what it was by his own example.  And every day on the march you would see some poor old ragged rebel riding his fine gray mare, and he was walking.   CAPTAIN JOE P. LEE  The other person I wish to speak of is Captain Joe P. Lee.  Captain Henry J. Webster was our regular captain, but was captured while on furlough, sent to a northern prison and died there, and Joe went up by promotion. He was quite a young man, about twenty-one years old, but as brave as any old Roman soldier that ever lived.  Joe's face was ever wreathed in smiles, and from the beginning to the end he was ever at the head of his company.  I do not think that any member of the company ever did call him by his title.  He was called simply \"Joe Lee,\" or more frequently \"Black Perch.\"  While on duty he was strict and firm, but off duty he was \"one of us boys.\"  We all loved and respected him, but everybody knows Joe, and further comment is unnecessary.  I merely mention these two persons because in this rapid sketch I may have cause occasionally to mention them, and only wish to introduce them to the reader, so he may understand more fully my ideas.  But, reader, please remember that I am not writing a history at all, and do not propose in these memoirs to be anybody's biographer.  I am only giving my own impressions.  If other persons think differently from me it is all right, and I forgive them.   CORINTH FORSAKEN  One morning a detail was sent to burn up and destroy all the provisions and army stores, and to blow up the arsenal.  The town was in a blaze of fire and the arsenal was roaring and popping and bellowing like pandemonium turned loose as we marched through Corinth on the morning of the evacuation.  We bade farewell to Corinth.  Its history was black and dark and damning.  No little speck of green oasis ever enlivened the dark recesses of our memory while at this place.  It's a desert that lives only in bitter memories.  It was but one vast graveyard that entombed the life and spirit of once brave and chivalrous men.

CHAPTER IV  TUPELO   We went into summer quarters at Tupelo.  Our principal occupation at this place was playing poker, chuck-a-luck and cracking graybacks (lice). Every soldier had a brigade of lice on him, and I have seen fellows so busily engaged in cracking them that it reminded me of an old woman knitting.  At first the boys would go off in the woods and hide to louse themselves, but that was unnecessary, the ground fairly crawled with lice.  Pharaoh's people, when they were resisting old Moses, never enjoyed the curse of lice more than we did.  The boys would frequently have a louse race.  There was one fellow who was winning all the money; his lice would run quicker and crawl faster than anybody's lice.  We could not understand it.  If some fellow happened to catch a fierce- looking louse, he would call on Dornin for a race.  Dornin would come and always win the stake.  The lice were placed in plates--this was the race course--and the first that crawled off was the winner.  At last we found out D.'s trick; he always heated his plate.  Billy P. said he had no lice on him.  \"Did you ever look?\"  \"No.\"  \"How do you know then?\"  \"If ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise,\" said Billy.  \"Why, there is one crawling on your bosom now.\"  Billy took him and put him back in his bosom and said to the louse, \"You stay there now; this makes the fourth time I have put you back, and if I catch you out again today I'll martyr you.\"  Billy was philosophic--the death of one louse did not stop the breed.   THE COURT MARTIAL AT TUPELO  At this place was held the grand court-martial.  Almost every day we would hear a discharge of musketry, and knew that some poor, trembling wretch had bid farewell to mortal things here below.  It seemed to be but a question of time with all of us as to when we too would be shot. We were afraid to chirp.  So far now as patriotism was concerned, we had forgotten all about that, and did not now so much love our country as we feared Bragg.  Men were being led to the death stake every day.  I heard of many being shot, but did not see but two men shot myself.  I do not know to what regiment they belonged, but I remember that they were mere beardless boys.  I did not learn for what crime or the magnitude of their offenses.  They might have deserved death for all I know.  I saw an old man, about sixty years old, whose name was Dave Brewer, and another man, about forty-five, by the name of Rube Franklin, whipped. There was many a man whipped and branded that I never saw or heard tell of.  But the reason I remembered these two was that they belonged to Company A of the 23rd Tennessee Regiment, and I knew many men in the regiment.  These two men were hung up by the hands, after having their heads shaved, to a tree, put there for the purpose, with the prongs left on them, and one hand was stretched toward one prong and the other hand to another prong, their feet, perhaps, just touching the ground.  The man who did the whipping had a thick piece of sole-leather, the end of which was cut in three strips, and this tacked on to the end of a paddle.  After the charges and specifications had been read (both men being stark naked), the whipper \"lit in\" on Rube, who was the youngest.  I do not think he intended to hit as hard as he did, but, being excited himself, he blistered Rube from head to foot.  Thirty-nine lashes was always the number.  Now, three times thirty-nine makes one hundred and seventeen. When he struck at all, one lick would make three whelps.  When he had finished Rube, the Captain commanding the whipping squad told him to lay it on old man Brewer as light as the law would allow, that old man Brewer was so old that he would die--that he could not stand it.  He struck old man Dave Brewer thirty-nine lashes, but they were laid on light.  Old Dave didn't beg and squall like Rube did.  He j-e-s-t did whip old man Dave.  Like the old preacher who caught the bear on Sunday.  They had him up before the church, agreed to let him off if he did not again set his trap.  \"Well,\" he said, \"brethren, I j-e-s-t did set it.\"   RAIDING ON ROASTINGEARS  At this place General Bragg issued an order authorizing citizens to defend themselves against the depredations of soldiers--to shoot them down if caught depredating.  Well, one day Byron Richardson and myself made a raid on an old citizen's roastingear patch.  We had pulled about all the corn that we could carry. I had my arms full and was about starting for camp, when an old citizen raised up and said, \"Stop there! drop that corn.\"  He had a double- barreled shotgun cocked and leveled at my breast.  \"Come and go with me to General Bragg's headquarters.  I intend to take you there, by the living God!\"  I was in for it.  Directed to go in front, I was being marched to Bragg's headquarters.  I could see the devil in the old fellow's eye.  I tried to beg off with good promises, but the old fellow was deaf to all entreaty. I represented to him all of our hardships and suffering.  But the old fellow was inexorable.  I was being steadily carried toward Bragg's headquarters.  I was determined not to see General Bragg, even if the old citizen shot me in the back.  When all at once a happy thought struck me. Says I, \"Mister, Byron Richardson is in your field, and if you will go back we can catch him and you can take both of us to General Bragg.\" The old fellow's spunk was up.  He had captured me so easy, he no doubt thought he could whip a dozen.  We went back a short distance, and there was Byron, who had just climbed over the fence and had his arms full, when the old citizen, diverted from me, leveled his double-barrel at Byron, when I made a grab for his gun, which was accidentally discharged in the air, and with the assistance of Byron, we had the old fellow and his gun both.  The table was turned.  We made the old fellow gather as much as he could carry, and made him carry it nearly to camp, when we dismissed him, a wiser if not a better and richer man.  We took his gun and bent it around a black jack tree.  He was at the soldiers' mercy.     CHAPTER V  KENTUCKY   WE GO INTO KENTUCKY  After being thoroughly reorganized at Tupelo, and the troops had recovered their health and spirits, we made an advance into Kentucky. We took the cars at Tupelo and went to Mobile, from thence across Mobile Bay to Montgomery, Alabama, then to Atlanta, from there to Chattanooga, and then over the mountains afoot to the blue-grass regions of Kentucky-- the dark and bloody ground.  Please remember, patient reader, that I write entirely from memory.  I have no data or diary or anything to go by, and memory is a peculiar faculty.  I find that I cannot remember towns and battles, and remember only the little things.  I remember how gladly the citizens of Kentucky received us.  I thought they had the prettiest girls that God ever made.  They could not do too much for us.  They had heaps and stacks of cooked rations along our route, with wine and cider everywhere, and the glad shouts of \"Hurrah for our Southern boys!\" greeted and welcomed us at every house.  Ah, the boys felt like soldiers again.  The bands played merrier and livelier tunes.  It was the patient convalescing; the fever had left him, he was getting fat and strong; the old fire was seen to illuminate his eyes; his step was buoyant and proud; he felt ashamed that he had ever been \"hacked\"; he could fight now.  It was the same old proud soldier of yore.  The bands played \"Dixie\" and the \"Bonnie Blue Flag,\" the citizens cheered, and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and threw us bouquets.  Ah, those were halcyon days, and your old soldier, kind reader, loves to recall that happy period. Mumfordsville had been captured with five thousand prisoners.  New recruits were continually joining our ranks.  Camp Dick Robinson, that immense pile of army stores, had fallen into our hands.  We rode upon the summit of the wave of success.  The boys had got clean clothes, and had their faces washed.  I saw then what I had long since forgotten--a \"cockade.\"  The Kentucky girls made cockades for us, and almost every soldier had one pinned on his hat.  But stirring events were hastening on, the black cloud of battle and war had begun then to appear much larger than a man's hand, in fact we could see the lightning flash and hear the thunder roar.  We were at Harrodsburg; the Yankees were approaching Perryville under General Buell.  The Yankees had been dogging our rear, picking up our stragglers and capturing some of our wagon trains.  This good time that we were having was too good to last.  We were in an ecstasy akin to heaven.  We were happy; the troops were jubilant; our manhood blood pulsated more warmly; our patriotism was awakened; our pride was renewed and stood ready for any emergency; we felt that one Southern man could whip twenty Yankees.  All was lovely and the goose hung high.  We went to dances and parties every night.  When General Chalmers marched to Perryville, in flanking and surrounding Mumfordsville, we marched the whole night long.  We, the private soldiers, did not know what was going on among the generals.  All that we had to do was march, march, march.  It mattered not how tired, hungry, or thirsty we were.  All that we had to do was to march that whole night long, and every staff officer who would pass, some fellow would say, \"Hey, mister, how far is it to Mumfordsville?\"  He would answer, \"five miles.\" It seemed to me we traveled a hundred miles and were always within five miles of Mumfordsville.  That night we heard a volley of musketry in our immediate front, and did not know what it meant, but soon we came to where a few soldiers had lighted some candles and were holding them over the body of a dead soldier.  It was Captain Allison, if I remember rightly, of General Cheatham's staff.  He was very"]]]
