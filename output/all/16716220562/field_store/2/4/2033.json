Of course, Don Luis, you know what it means, often, when pay ore fails to come out of a streak, and a solid wall of blank rock is encountered.\"  By \"blank rock\" Tom meant rock that did not contain a promising or paying amount of metal in the ore.  \"What it means?\" Montez asked.  \"No; I can't say that I do.\"  \"The wall of blank rock, found at the end of a vein of gold, Don Luis, often, if not usually, means that the vein has run out, and that it is useless to dig further.\"  \"I did not know that,\" murmured the Mexican, in a tone of merely polite astonishment.  \"Then you believe that _El Sombrero_ will not turn out much more profitable ore?\"  \"I didn't say that,\" Tom continued.  \"But I will admit that finding the wall of blank rock ahead made me a bit nervous.  Some great mines have been started, Don Luis, as you must be aware.  For a few weeks they have panned out ore of the highest value.  Much capital has been put into such mines, and for a time men have thought they owned a new Golconda.  Then--suddenly--the blank wall, and no more gold has ever come out of that mine.  In other words, it was but a pocket of rich gold that had been struck, and nothing more.  Hundreds of men have ruined themselves by investing in such mines.\"  \"I see,\" murmured Don Luis, thoughtfully.  \"You did not know this before?\" Tom asked, in some amazement.  \"No, Senor Tomaso.  I have been a good business man, I suppose, for I have prospered; and much of my money has been made in mining. Yet I have never had the assurance to consider myself a practical mining man.  Dr. Tisco, here, is--\"  \"An ignoramus on the subject of mining,\" declared the secretary, who appeared just then to wake up.  \"Carlos is modest,\" laughed Don Luis.  \"True, he is not a skilled mining man, yet he knows so much on the subject that, compared with him, I am an ignoramus.  But that is what you are here for, you two.  You are the experts.  Investigate, and then instruct us.\"  \"Have you any record of the number of times that you have encountered the blank rock, and the number of feet in thickness of the wall in each case?\" Tom asked.  \"Oh, no.\"  \"That is unfortunate,\" said Reade, thoughtfully.  \"Hereafter we will keep such a record carefully.  Don Luis, I will admit that I am perplexed and worried over this blank rock problem.  I know Hazelton is, too.\"  \"Yes, it is very strange,\" agreed Harry, looking up.  Truth to tell, he had hardly been following the talk at all.  Harry Hazelton was quite content to be caught napping whenever Tom Reade had his eyes open.  \"Now, I would like to go back to the mine and stay there until some time in the night,\" Tom proposed.  \"I would like to take Hazelton with me.  Soon we will arrange it, if necessary, so that Harry and I shall divide the time at the mine.  Whenever, in any of the tunnels, blank rock is struck, whichever one of us is in charge will stay by the blank rock blasting, keeping careful record, until pay ore is struck again.\"  \"You two young engineers are too infernally methodical,\" grumbled Dr. Tisco under his breath.\"  \"That is a very excellent plan,\" smiled Montez, amiably.  \"We will put some such plan into operation as soon as we are fairly under way.  But not to-day.\"  \"I would like to start at once,\" Tom insisted.  \"Not to-day,\" once more replied Don Luis, though without losing patience.  \"Yet, if you are anxious to know how the blank rock is coming I can telephone the mine and get all the information within five minutes.  That will be an excellent idea.  I will do it now, in fact.\"  Crossing the room, Don Luis rang and called for the mine.  \"Our young engineers are very sharp--especially Senor Reade,\" murmured Dr. Tisco to himself, while the telephone conversation was going on in Spanish.  \"Yet I wonder if our young engineer does not half suspect that Don Luis has no man at the other end of the wire?\"  Tom did not suspect the telephone trick.  In fact, the young chief engineer had as yet no deep suspicion that Don Luis was a rogue at heart.  \"The report is excellent,\" called Don Luis, gayly, as he came back.  \"In that tunnel where we saw the blasting done the blank rock has been penetrated, and the rich ore is coming again.\"  \"How I'd like to see it!\" Tom glowed.  \"Why?\" asked Don Luis, quickly.  \"Because I am anxious to know all the secrets, all the indications, of fine old _El Sombrero_.\"  \"It _is_ a fine mine, isn't it, Senor Tomaso?\" demanded Don Luis, enthusiastically.  \"From all indications it ought to be,\" Reade answered.  \"Yet it's a new formation of rock to me--this sandwich formation as I might call it, with the alternate layers of rich ore and blank stuff.\"  \"I have been drawing up a report on the mine,\" murmured Montez, opening a drawer in his desk.  \"This report describes the operations and the profits so far.  Glance through it with me.\"  The report had been written in English, by either Dr. Tisco or his employer.  Tom and Harry listened carefully to the reading.  \"But why do you put so much enthusiasm into the report, Don Luis, when the mine is not for sale and is not to be run as a stock company property?\"  \"Of course, _El Sombrero_ is my sole property, and of course I shall keep it so,\" smiled the Mexican.  \"But I like, even in a report to myself, for my own use, to have the report set forth all the truths concerning the mine.\"  \"That is reasonable,\" Tom agreed.  \"Now, Senor Tomaso, as you have seen, this report is couched in my own English.  I would be glad if you would write this out for me, putting it into better English.\"  \"It would seem like presumption in me to think that I could put it into better English,\" Reade protested.  \"Nevertheless, to please me, will you put this report into your own English?\" requested Don Luis.  \"With all the pleasure in the world,\" Tom assented.  \"Here are writing materials, then.\"  \"But I see that you have a typewriting machine over in the corner,\" suggested the young chief engineer.  \"I can write the report much better and more rapidly on the machine.\"  \"Ah!\" breathed the Mexican, looking highly pleased.  \"If you will but do that!  We will go outside so as not to disturb you.\"  The report, being a long one and containing several tables of figures, Reade was occupied nearly three hours.  During this time Don Luis conducted Harry over the estate, pointing out many things of interest.  At last Tom, with a slight backache from bending so long over the machine, leaned back and carefully read what he had written.  \"Do you wish anything, _caballero_?\" inquired Nicolas, appearing as though from hiding.  \"You might be good enough to tell Don Luis that I have finished, and that I await his pleasure.\"  Nicolas disappeared.  Five minutes later Montez, his secretary and Hazelton came in.  Tom read through his typewritten draft of the report.  \"Excellent!  gr-r-r-rand!  glorious!\" breathed Don Luis.  \"Ah, you are a master of English, Senor Tomaso.  Myself, I understand Spanish better.  And now one stroke of the pen for each of you,\" added the _hidalgo_, crossing the room to his desk.  \"As my new engineers you shall both sign this report, and I shall have much pleasure from reading this, many times, when I am an old man.\"  Don Luis dipped a pen in ink, then held it up.  Harry was about to take the pen when Tom Reade drawled:  \"It wouldn't be quite right for us to sign this report, Don Luis.\"  \"Why not?\" queried the Mexican, wheeling like a flash.  \"Just for the simple reason,\" Reade answered, \"that to sign the report would be to state all the facts contained in the report as being of our personal observation.  We haven't seen enough of the mine, as yet, for it to be right for us to sign the report. An engineer's signature to a report is his statement--ON HONOR--that he personally knows such report to be true.  So I am very certain you will understand that it would be a breach of honor for us to sign this document.\"  \"Ah!  He is clever--and now the real trouble must begin!\"  Dr. Tisco told himself.  \"These engineers are not easily duped, but in Don Luis's hands they will destroy themselves!\"     CHAPTER VI  WATCHING THE MIDNIGHT LIGHTS   Don Luis Montez laid down the pen.  Outwardly he was as amiable as ever; certainly he was all smiles.  \"A thousand pardons, _caballeros_!\" he murmured.  \"Of course, you are quite right.  It had not occurred to me in that light before. True, the report was intended only for my own pleasure in later years, but that does not alter the nice point of honor.\"  Tom Reade was deceived by Don Luis's manner.  He did not suspect that, at this very instant, the Mexican was consumed with demoniacal rage.  \"I shall not be patient another time,\" muttered Don Luis, between his teeth and under his breath.  Yet aloud he said:  \"We have had too much of business to-day.  We are tiring ourselves. Until dinner time let us go outside and be gentlemen.  Business for to-morrow or next week.  And my dear daughter.  Brute!  I have been forgetting her.\"  Senorita Francesca, a darkly beautiful girl of eighteen, shy and retiring from the convent schooling that had ended but lately, soon came downstairs at her father's summons.  Dr. Tisco bowed low before the charming girl.  Tom and Harry were presented, and tried to make themselves agreeable to the young Mexican girl. Senorita Francesca's shyness, however, made this somewhat difficult, so the young engineers felt inwardly grateful when Dr. Tisco strolled down the porch with her.  Dinner proved to be a somewhat formal affair.  Yet, as soon as the meal was finished Senorita Francesca was escorted from the dining room by her father and returned to her room.  \"What did you think of the young lady, Tom?\"  Harry asked his chum when he could do so privately.  \"A fine-looking girl,\" Reade answered briefly.  \"But I fear she would be highly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#8)"],["body","if she knew that, all through dinner, my every thought was on the mine and the problems that we shall find there.\"  \"I want to talk with you about that mine, and about some impressions that I have formed here,\" murmured Hazelton.  \"Then another time, my dear fellow, for here comes Don Luis, and I see Dr. Tisco returning from the garden.\"  That forestalled conversation for the time being.  When the young engineers, still relentlessly attended by Nicolas, sought their own rooms Hazelton was so drowsy that he undressed hurriedly and dropped into bed.  Later in the night Harry sat up suddenly in the dark.  Some one was moving in the parlor that separated the two bedrooms.  An instant after awakening Harry slipped off the bed, then stole toward the next room.  In the darkness he made out a moving figure.  Like a panther Harry sprang, landing on the all but invisible figure.  \"Now, I've got you!\" Hazelton hissed, wrapping his arms around the prowler.  \"And small credit to you,\" drawled Tom's dry voice.  \"Hist!\"  \"What's up?\" demanded Hazelton, dropping his voice to a whisper.  \"You and I are.\"  \"But what's the matter?\"  \"I couldn't sleep,\" Tom whispered.  \"You--troubled with nerves!\" gasped Hazelton.  \"Not just the way you understand it,\" returned Tom.  \"But I was thinking, thinking, and I sat by the window yonder.  Come over there, Harry, but step without noise.\"  Wondering what it all meant, Hazelton softly followed his chum to the open window.  \"Now, look,\" said Tom, pointing, \"and tell me what you see.\"  \"A moment ago I thought I saw a light twinkling over there among the hills.\"  \"Look sixty seconds longer, and you'll see more lights, Harry; those lights are on the trail that leads from the nearest gold mines to _El Sombrero_.  It is the trail Don Luis pointed out to us to-day.\"  \"But what--\"  \"Harry, I'm going to get on my clothes and slip over in that direction. Do you want to go with me?\"  \"Yes; but what--\"  \"I can tell you better when we're on the way.  Come on; dress!  We can easily leave the house without being detected.\"  Though Harry had already been through hosts of adventures, he felt creepy as he dressed with speed and stealth, bent on slipping unobserved out of their employer's house.  But he was used to following his chum's lead.  When both were ready, which was very soon, Tom softly opened the door of their parlor, thrusting one foot out into the broad corridor. As he did so he kicked against a man lying prostrate on the floor. It was Nicolas, the Mexican attendant, sleeping across their threshold that he might be on hand when wanted.  The man stirred, muttered something almost inaudible, then gradually began to breathe more deeply.  Tom, after waiting, took a step over the body of Nicolas.  Harry closed the door behind them, then followed.  Soon after they stood out on the lawn.  \"I'm glad Nicolas went to sleep again,\" muttered Tom, in a low voice.  \"The fellow would have insisted on following us, and I wouldn't want him with us to-night, to tell Don Luis everything.\"  \"But what on earth--\"  \"Harry, old fellow, Don Luis is the essence of courtesy.  He has been very polite to us, too.  Yet something has aroused a suspicion in me that Don Luis Montez wishes to use us in some way that we wouldn't care to be used.  So I'm saying little, but my eyes are going to be open all the time from now on.\"  \"Oh, Don Luis must be on the square,\" Hazelton retorted.  \"What could he want of us that is crooked?\"  \"I don't know, yet,\" Tom replied, as he led the way rapidly down the road.  \"But I'm going to watch, and, if there's anything wrong, I'm going to get a line on it.\"  \"_El Sombrero_ is Don Luis's own mine.  Surely he hasn't hired us to fool him about his own property.\"  \"I don't know what it is that's wrong,\" Tom admitted.  \"Nor am I sure that anything is wrong.  But I'm going to do my own watching and gather some of my own information.  See, there are the lights on that trail beyond, and there are several lights.  It looks like a caravan moving down the trail.\"  \"A caravan?\" Harry repeated.  \"Of what?\"  \"I don't know, Harry.  That's what I'm here to-night to find out.\"  Brisk, soft walking brought them nearer and nearer to the twinkling lights along the trail that ran into their own road at a point lower down.  \"I wish I knew what on earth Tom is thinking about,\" Harry muttered to himself.  \"However, I may as well save my breath just now.  If I hang to him I'm likely to know what it is.\"  \"We'll reach a hiding place from which we can watch that caravan, or whatever it is, turn from the hill trail into this road,\" Tom whispered, after they had gone somewhat further.  At this point the main road that ran from.  Don Luis's estate to his mine was decidedly irregular.  Many boulders jutted out, making a frequent change in the course of the road necessary. It was Tom's intention to gain the nearest ledge of rock of this sort to the hill trail, and there hide to watch the caravan.  They had nearly reached this point when out of the darkness a figure stole softly to meet them.  \"Nicolas!\" muttered Tom, in a low voice, all but rubbing his eyes. \"How on earth did you get here?\"  \"Am I not commanded to keep with you everywhere, and serve you in all things?\" demanded the servant.  \"Do not go around that next point in the road, _caballeros_.  If you do, you will run straight into Pedro Gato, who has other men with him.\"     CHAPTER VII  DON LUIS'S ENGINEERING PROBLEM   \"Gato?\" whispered Harry.  \"What is he doing around here?\"  \"There is no reason why we should care what he is doing,\" Tom returned.  \"He isn't in the employ of the mine.  Come along, Harry.\"  But Nicolas seized the young chief engineer by the arm.  \"Beat me, if you will, Senor Americano,\" pleaded Nicolas.  \"But don't encounter Gato.  It would be as much as your life is worth.\"  \"Why?  Is Gato on the warpath for us?\" Tom questioned.  \"I fear so,\" Nicolas answered.  \"Don't let him see you.\"  \"But I must see him, if the fellow is out for us,\" muttered Tom. \"Show me where he is.\"  \"He and three or four men are camped just around there,\" said the Mexican servant, pointing.  \"Come along, Harry,\" Tom whispered.  \"Go cat-foot.\"  Ere the young engineers came in sight around the turn a slight glow of light against the stones caught their glance.  Tom held a hand behind him as a signal to Hazelton to slow up.  Then Reade peered around a jutting ledge of rock.  On the ground, around a low camp-fire, were seated four Mexicans. Two of the number had rifles, that lay on the ground near them. Behind them, an ugly scowl on his face, sat Gato, his back resting against a rock.  \"But you will not find your enemies out here to-night, Senor Gato,\" softly remarked one of the quartette around the fire.  \"No,\" admitted Gato, in a growling voice.  \"Then why are we waiting here?\"  \"Because it pleases me,\" snapped the big fellow.  \"What ails you? Am I not paying you?\"  \"But two of us--and I am one of them--do not like to be seen,\" rejoined the speaker at the fire.  \"The troops hunt us.  There is a price on our heads.\"  \"Bandits!\" muttered Tom Reade, under his breath, as he drew back. \"I have heard that Mexico is overrun with bandits.  These gentlemen are some of the fraternity.\"  \"Take us up to the house, Gato,\" urged one of the men at the fire. \"We shall know how to enter and find your friends.  Everyone sleeps there.  It will be the safer way.\"  \"It does not suit me,\" retorted Gato, sullenly.  \"But why not?\"  \"Am I not paying you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then take my orders and do not ask questions.\"  At this there were sounds of dissatisfaction from all four of these bad men.  \"For one thing,\" Gato explained, \"Don Luis would not like it.  He would accuse me of treachery--or worse.  I do not want Don Luis's ill will, you see.\"  \"But Don Luis will be angry, in any case, if you injure his engineers, won't he?\" asked one of the men.  \"A little, but after a while, Don Luis will not care what I do to the Americanos,\" growled Pedro Gato.  \"Humph!  That's interesting--if true,\" whispered Tom Reade.  \"Yet what are we doing here?\" insisted one of the men.  \"Here, so close to where the troops might pick us up?\"  \"You are obeying orders,\" snarled Gato.  \"But that information is not quite enough to suit us,\" objected one of the Mexicans.  \"You might go your own way, then,\" sneered Gato.  \"I can find other men who are not so curious.  However, I will say that, when daylight comes, we will hide not far from here.  None of you know the Americanos by sight.  I will point them out to you as they pass by in the daylight.\"  \"And then--what?\" pressed one of the rough men.  \"Are we to kill the Americanos from ambush?\"  \"Eh?\" gasped Tom Reade, with a start.  \"If you have to,\" nodded Pedro Gato.  \"Though, in that case, I shall call you clumsy.  I shall pay you just four times as much if you bring them to me as prisoners.  Remember that.  Before I despatch these infernal Gringos I shall want the fun of tormenting them.\"  \"Oh, you will eh?\" thought Tom, with a slight shudder.  \"I heard, Gato,\" ventured one of the Mexicans, incautiously, \"that one of the Americanos beat you fearfully--that he threw you down and stamped on you.\"  \"It is a lie!\" uttered Gato, leaping to his feet, his face distorted with rage.  \"It is a lie, I tell you.  The man does not live who can beat me in a fight.\"  \"I was struck with amazement at the tale,\" admitted the Mexican who had brought about this outburst.  \"And well you might be,\" continued Gato, savagely.  \"But the Americanos procured my discharge.  And that was humiliation enough.\"  \"Yet what difference does it make, Gato.  As soon as Don Luis is through with the Americanos he will restore you to your old position.\"  \"It is because the Americanos treated me with such contempt,\" retorted Pedro.  \"No man sneers at me and lives.\"  \"You unhung bandit!\" muttered Tom under his breath.  \"Why don't you tell your bandit friends that you are angry because of the trouncing I gave you before"]]]
