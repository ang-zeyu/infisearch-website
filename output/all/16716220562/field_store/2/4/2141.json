CHAPTER VII  THE ESCAPE   Sunday, October 3d, was the day we had chosen as our \"going-away\" day. We did no work on Sundays, and so had a full day's rest. Besides, we had a chance for a bath on Sunday, and knew we needed every advantage we could get, for it was a long way to Switzerland.  The day had been sunny and bright, but toward evening big, heavy clouds rolled up from the southwest, and the darkness came on early. This. suited our purpose, and it was hard for Bromley and me to keep our accustomed air of unconcern.  By a fortunate arrangement, we were occupying a room downstairs in the old boarding-house, which made our escape less difficult. The upstairs sleeping-place would hold only three more when the six of us arrived from Giessen the week previous, and that left three of us for a downstairs room. For this, Bromley and I, and a young Englishman called Bherral were chosen.  The walls of the house were of plaster, and the windows had a double barring of barbed wire, stapled in; but plaster does not make a very secure bedding for staples, and we figured it would not be hard to pry them out.  [Illustration: Two Pages from Private Simmons's Diary]  There was a light outside which burned all night at the corner of the house, and by it the windows were brightly illumined. This made our exit rather difficult. The doors were all locked, and there were about a dozen guards who slept in another room adjoining ours. Some of them slept, we knew, and we hoped they all did.  None of the prisoners at this place had ever attempted to escape, and so the guard had become less vigilant. I suppose they figured it out that if any of us were determined to go, we would make the start from the field where we were working, and where there were no guards at all.  But they made a fine bluff at being awake all night, for we heard them walking up and down in the early evening. However, we reasoned that they were not any keener on sitting up than any of the rest of us would be if we didn't have to; and it turned out that our faith in them was justified.  Although we did not have to work on Sunday, those who had to work in the mines had no seventh day of rest, and the night-shift went out each night about ten-thirty when the day-shift men came in. We had decided on eleven-thirty as the hour for our departure, giving the guard one hour in which to settle down after this disturbance.  We were lying on our mattresses, apparently wrapped in a heavy slumber, but in reality eagerly listening to every sound.... We heard the night-workers going out, and the day-men coming in and going heavily to rest.... A guard seemed restless for a while and tramped up and down the creaking floor... but at last the only sound to be heard was the deep breathing of tired men.  I heard Bromley gently reaching for his clothes, and I did not lose any time in getting into mine. Bherral and a little Frenchman, who were in our room, were wide awake and full of fear. They had tried to dissuade us.  But the guards, all unsuspecting, slept on.  They slept the sweet sleep of childhood while we pushed out the strands of barbed wire which protected the window; they slept while Bromley slipped cautiously to the ground, and while I handed him down the overcoats, boots, and parcels of food (which we had been saving for a month); they slept while I slid through the window and dropped to the ground, too.  Just then the wind caught the window, which was on a hinge, and slammed it noisily against the wall.  We grabbed our belongings, and ran!    CHAPTER VIII  OFF FOR SWITZERLAND!   We ran as if the whole German Army were in pursuit. Our feet did not seem to touch the ground. I believe if we could have held that pace we should have been in Switzerland in the morning!  Reaching a little hollow, we slackened our pace and listened. There was not a sound from behind. Either there was no more wind, or the boys had closed the window from within. We figured that they would do this, and open it before morning so they could claim they had not heard us go. Then we put on our boots.  The night was at its blackest, and a drizzling rain began to fall. This was in our favor, for nobody was likely to be about on such a night. When we saw we were not pursued, we took time to arrange our packs. I carried my compass, which I had been able to secrete during numerous searchings, and my map, a pair of socks, pipe, tobacco, matches in a tin box, an empty beer-bottle, and several things to eat, saved from our parcels,--chocolate, tinned meat, biscuits, cheese, and bread. Bromley had a pack similar to mine, and when we got them ready and our overcoats on, we started off in a southeasterly direction, guided by the light from the place we had left. We walked as fast as we could in the darkness, which was heavy enough to hide in, but made progress very difficult, for we could not see each other or one step before us. We tripped over a railway track once, and if there had been any one near they might have heard us.  But in spite of the rain, which fell with steady insistence and began to weigh down our overcoats; in spite of the blackness which made the travelling unbelievably difficult; in spite of the fact that we were in a land of enemies, playing a desperate game against terrible odds, we were happier than either of us had been since being taken to Germany, for a weight had been rolled off our souls. We were on our way to freedom!  When we found it necessary to consult the compass, I took off my overcoat and lay flat on the ground with my compass and matches ready. Bromley put my coat over my head and shoulders, tucking it well in around me, so no light could shine through. Then I struck a match, and in its light made the observation, always taking into consideration the fact that in that part of Europe the compass points sixteen or seventeen degrees west of due north.  We were careful to avoid the main roads and to seek out the seldom-travelled, ones, for we knew that our only chance was in not being seen at all, as we wore our own Canadian uniforms, which would brand us at once for what we were. Added to that, we could not form a single German sentence if we were challenged. Of course, I could say \"that Herr Schmidt expected to have his young child baptized in the church next Sunday, God willing,\" but I felt that that was not altogether the proper reply to make to the command--\"Halt! Wer da?\"  The villages were very thick here, and our chief difficulty was to keep out of them. Once we ventured rather close to the road which ran near the railroad, and heard a number of people talking. They were travellers who had alighted from the train which had raced past us in the darkness a few minutes before. The station is often quite a distance from the village, and these were the passengers walking back to their homes--the village which we had been avoiding.  We dropped to the ground, and the people went by, one old man singing. I knew he was old, for his voice was cracked and thin, but of great sweetness, and he sang an aria from a musical comedy which was popular then, called \"The Joy of Life.\" I had heard a doctor in the lazaret singing it.  When the sound had grown fainter in the distance, we came out of our hiding-place and went on.  \"It seems hard,\" said Bromley, \"to be fighting with people who can sing like that. I can't work up any ill-will to that good old soul, going home singing--and I don't believe he has any ill-will to us. I couldn't fight the Germans if they were all like this old chap and Sank!\"  \"You wouldn't need to,\" I said. \"There would not have been any fighting.\"  And then we strained our ears to listen to the song, not a word of which we understood, though to us the music was full of good-will and joy.  \"We've got to keep farther out,\" I said at last. \"We are sure to run into some one and then it will be all up with us!\"  We found, at last, after much stumbling over rough ground, a road quite grass-grown and apparently abandoned. We followed it for about a mile, making good progress, until we came to a stream over which there was a bridge. We hesitated a minute before going over, but the place was as silent as a cemetery, and seemed perfectly safe. So we cautiously went over, keeping a sharp outlook all the time. When we were over the bridge, we found ourselves in the one street of another village.  We stopped for a minute and listened. There was not a sound. We then went forward. Most of the streets of the villages are paved with cobblestones, but these were not, and our boots made no sound on the dirt road. Not even a dog barked, and just as we were at the farther end of it, the village clock rang the hour of three!  \"That's all right for once,\" I said, \"but it's risky; I don't think we'd better try it again. Some barking dog is sure to awake.\"  Soon after that the east grew red with morning, and we struck straight into the woods to find shelter. We soon found ourselves in high rushes growing out of swampy ground, and as we plunged along, we came to a high woven-wire fence, which we supposed marked the bounds of a game preserve.  We quickened our pace, although the going was bad, for the light was growing and we knew these German peasants are uncomfortably early in their habits. We came on a garden, carefully fenced with rails, and helped ourselves to a few carrots and turnips to save our supply of food, and, finding near there a fairly thick wood, decided to camp for the day.  That was Monday, October 4th, and was a miserable day with sudden bursts of sunshine that made our hearts light with the hope of getting both warm and dry; but the sunshine no sooner came than it was gone, and then a shower of rain would beat down on us.  However, we managed to make our feet comfortable with the extra pair of socks, and we ate some carrots, bread, and cheese. But it was so cold, we could not sleep.  We were glad when it grew dark enough for us "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12881"],["title","Mrs. Budlong's Christmas Presents (#0)"],["body","MRS.

BUDLONG'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS  I  AT THE SIGN OF THE PIANO LAMP  The morning after Christmas Eve is the worst morning-after there is. The very house suffers the headache that follows a prolonged spree. Remorse stalks at large; remorse for the things one gave--and did not give--and got.  Everybody must act a general glee which can be felt only specifically, if at all.  Everybody must exclaim about everything Oh! and Ah! and How Sweet of You! and Isn't it Perfectly Dear! The very THING I Wanted! and How DID you EVER Guess it?  Christmas morning in the town of Carthage is a day when most of the people keep close at home, for Christmas is another passover.  It is Santa Claus that passes over.  People in Carthage are not rich; the shops are not grandiose, and inter-family presents are apt to be trivial and futile--or worse yet, utile.  The Carthaginian mother generally finds that Father has credited the hat she got last fall, to this Christmas; the elder brothers receive warm under-things and the young ones brass-toed boots, mitts and mufflers.  The girls may find something ornamental in their stockings, and their stockings may be silk or nearly--but then girls have to be foolishly diked up anyway, or they will never be married out.  Dressing up daughters comes under the head of window-display or coupons, and is charged off to publicity.  Nearly everybody in Carthage--except Mrs. Ulysses S. G. Budlong--celebrates Christmas behind closed doors.  People find it easier to rhapsodize when the collateral is not shown.  It is amazing how far a Carthaginian can go on the most meager donation.  The formula is usually: \"We had Such a lovely Christmas at our house. What did I get?  Oh, so many things I can't reMember!\"  But Mrs. Ulysses S. G. Budlong does not celebrate her Christmasses behind closed doors--or rather she did not: a strange change came over her this last Christmas.  She used to open her doors wide--metaphorically, that is; for there was a storm-door with a spring on it to keep the cold draught out of the hall.  As regular as Christmas itself was the oh-quite-informal reception Mrs. Budlong gave to mitigate the ineffable stupidity of Christmas afternoon: that dolorous period when one meditates the ancient platitude that anticipation is better than realization; and suddenly understands why it is blesseder to give than to receive: because one does not have to wear what one gives away.  On Christmas Mrs. U. S. G. Budlong took all the gifts she had gleaned, and piled them on and around the baby grand piano in the back parlor.  There was a piano lamp there, one of those illuminated umbrellas--about as large and as useful as a date-palm tree.  Along about that time in the afternoon when the Christmas dinner becomes a matter of hopeless remorse, Mrs. Budlong's neighbors were expected to drop in and view the loot under the lamp.  It looked like hospitality, but it felt like hostility.  She passed her neighbors under the yoke and gloated over her guests, while seeming to overgloat her gifts.  But she got the gifts.  There was no question of that.  By hook or by crook she saw to it that the bazaar under the piano lamp always groaned.  One of the chief engines for keeping up the display was the display itself.  Everybody who knew Mrs. Budlong--and not to know Mrs. Budlong was to argue oneself unknown--knew that he or she would be invited to this Christmas triumph.  And being invited rather implied being represented in the tribute.  Hence ensued a curious rivalry in Carthage.  People vied with each other in giving Mrs. Budlong presents; not that they loved Mrs. Budlong more, but that they loved comparisons less.  The rivalry had grown to ridiculous proportions.  But of course Mrs. Budlong did not care how ridiculous it grew; for it could hardly have escaped her shrewd eyes how largely it advantaged her that people should give her presents in order to show other people that some people needn't think they could show off before other people without having other people show that they could show off, too, as well as other people could.  The pyschology must be correct, for it is incoherent.  Mrs. Budlong herself was never known to break any of the commandments, but in her back parlor her neighbors made flitters of the one against coveting thy neighbor's and-so-forth and so-on.  It was when Mr. and Mrs. County Road Supervisor Detwiller were walking home from one of these occasions, that Mr. Detwiller was saying: \"Well, ain't Mizzes Budlong the niftiest little gift-getter that ever held up a train?  How on earth did We happen to get stung?\"  \"I don't know, Roscoe.  It's one of those things you can't get out of without getting out of town too.  Here we've been and gone and skimped our own children to buy something that would show up good in Mrs. Budlong's back parlor, and when I laid eyes on it in all that clutter--why, if it didn't look like something the cat brought in, I'll eat it!\"  Mr. Detwiller had only one consolation--and he grinned over it:  \"Well, there's no use cryin' over spilt gifts.  But did you see how she stuck old Widower Clute for that Japanese porcelain vace--I notice she called it vahs?\"  \"Porcelain?\" sniffed Mrs. Detwiller.  \"Paper musshay!\"  \"Well, getting even a paper--what you said--from old Clute is equal to extracting solid gold from anybody else.  He's the stingiest man in sev'n states.  He don't care any more for a two dollar bill than he does for his right eye.  I bet she gave him ether before he let go.\"  \"Oh, she works all the old bachelors and widowers that way,\" said Mrs. Detwiller, with a mixture of contempt and awe.  \"Invites 'em to a dinner party or two around Christmas marketing time, and begins to talk about how pretty the shops are and how tempting everything she wants is; says she saw a nimitation bronze clock at Strouther and Streckfuss's that it almost broke her heart to leave there.  But o' course she couldn't afford to buy those kind of things for herself now when she's got to remember all her dear friends, and she runs on and on and the old batch growls, 'Stung again!' and goes to Strouther and Streckfuss's and tells Mr. Streckfuss to send Mrs. Budlong that blamed bronze clock she was admiring.  And that's how she gets things.  I could do it myself if I'd a mind to.\"  Mr. Detwiller felt that there was more envy than truth in this last remark, and he was rash enough to speak up for justice: \"You could if you'd a mind to?  Yep.  If you'd a mind to!  That's what somebody said about Shakespeare's plays.  'I could a wrote 'em myself if I'd a mind to,' says he, and somebody else said, 'Yes, if you'd a mind to,' he says.  And that's about it.  Any body could do what Mizzes Budlong does if they had the mind to; but the thing is, she's got the mind to.  She goes after the gifts--and gits 'em.  She don't almost git 'em, and she ain't goin' to git 'em.  She gits 'em.  And what gits me is how she gits 'em.\"  \"Roscoe Detwiller, if you're goin' to praise that woman in the presence of your own lawful wife, I'll never speak to you the longest day I live.\" \"Who's praisin' her?  I was just sayin'--\"  \"Why, Roscoe Detwiller, you did, too!  And I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself.\"  \"Say, what ails you?  Why, I was roastin' her to beat the band.\"  \"And to think that on Christmas day of all days I should live to hear my own husband that I've loved and cherished and worked my fingers to the bone and never got any thanks and other women keepin' two and three hired girls, and after him denyin' his own children things to get expensive presents for a shameless creature like that Budlong woman--\"  All over Carthage on Christmas afternoons couples were similarly at loggerheads over Mrs. Budlong's annual triumph.  Now of course Mrs. Budlong did not get all those presents without giving presents.  Not in Carthage!  It might have been possible to bamboozle these people one Christmas, but never another.  Mrs. Budlong gave heaps of presents.  Christmas was an industry with her, an ambition; Christmas was her career.  It had long ago lost its religious significance for her, as for nearly everybody else in Carthage.  Even Mr. Frankenstein (the Pantatorium magnate) is one of the most ardent advertisers of Christmas bargains, while Isidore Strouther and Esau Streckfuss are \"almost persuaded\" every December. They might be entirely persuaded if it were not for the scenes they witness in their aisles during the last weeks of Yuletide and the aftermath of trying to collect from the Gentile husbands during Billtide.  Mrs.  Budlong's Christmas presents were of two sorts: those she made herself and those she made her husband pay for.  He was the typical husband who never fails to settle his wife's bills, so long as he may raise a row about them till his wife cries and looks like an expensive luxury which only a really successful man could afford. Then he subsides until the first of the next month.     II  CHRONICLES OF A CRAFTSMAN  Mrs. Budlong's campaign was undertaken with the same farsightedness as a magazine editor's.  On or about the Fourth of July she began to worry and plan.  By the second week in August she had her tatting well under way.  By the middle of September she was getting in her embroidered doilies.
