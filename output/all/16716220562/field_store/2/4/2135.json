At this moment Mr. Waddell, whose thoughts were never disturbed by conversation around him, broke in with a question.  \"What does a Tommy do,\" he inquired, \"if he meets an officer wheeling a wheelbarrow?\"  \"Who is wheeling the barrow,\" inquired the meticulous Struthers--\"the officer or the Tommy?\"  \"The Tommy, of course!\" replied Waddell in quite a shocked voice. \"What is he to do? If he tries to salute he will upset the barrow, you know.\"  \"He turns his head sharply towards the officer for six paces,\" explained the ever-ready Struthers. \"When a soldier is not in a position to salute in the ordinary way--\"  \"I say,\" inquired Bobby Little rather shyly, \"do you ever look the other way when you meet a Tommy?\"  \"How do you mean?\" asked everybody.  \"Well, the other day I met one walking out with his girl along the road, and I felt so blooming _de trop_ that--\"  Here the \"fall-in\" sounded, and this delicate problem was left unsolved. But Mr. Waddell, who liked to get to the bottom of things, continued to ponder these matters as he marched. He mistrusted the omniscience of Struthers and the superficial infallibility of the self-satisfied Cockerell. Accordingly, after consultation with that eager searcher after knowledge, Second Lieutenant Little, he took the laudable but fatal step of carrying his difficulties to one Captain Wagstaffe, the humorist of the Battalion.  Wagstaffe listened with an appearance of absorbed interest. Finally he said--  \"These are very important questions, Mr. Waddell, and you acted quite rightly in laying them before me. I will consult the Deputy Assistant Instructor in Military Etiquette, and will obtain a written answer to your inquiries.\"  \"Oh, thanks awfully, sir!\" exclaimed Waddell.  The result of Captain Wagstaffe's application to the mysterious official just designated was forthcoming next day in the form of a neatly typed document. It was posted in the Ante-room (the C.O. being out at dinner), and ran as follows:--   SALUTES  YOUNG OFFICERS, HINTS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF  The following is the correct procedure for a young officer in charge of an armed party upon meeting--  (a) A Staff Officer riding a bicycle.  _Correct Procedure_.--If marching at attention, order your men to march at ease and to light cigarettes and eat bananas. Then, having fixed bayonets, give the order: _Across the road--straggle!_  (b) A funeral.  _Correct Procedure_.--Strike up _Tipperary_, and look the other way.  (c) A General Officer, who strolls across your Barrack Square precisely at the moment when you and your Platoon have got into mutual difficulties.  _Correct Procedure_.--Lie down flat upon your face (directing your platoon to do the same), cover your head with gravel, and pretend you are not there.   SPECIAL CASES  (a) A soldier, wheeling a wheelbarrow and balancing a swill-tub on his head, meets an officer walking out in review dress.  _Correct Procedure_.--The soldier will immediately cant the swill-tub to an angle of forty-five degrees at a distance of one and a half inches above his right eyebrow. (In the case of Rifle Regiments the soldier will balance the swill-tub on his nose.) He will then invite the officer, by a smart movement of the left ear, to seat himself on the wheelbarrow.  _Correct Acknowledgment_.--The officer will comply, placing his feet upon the right and left hubs of the wheel respectively, with the ball of the toe in each case at a distance of one inch (when serving abroad, 2-1/2 centimetres) from the centre of gravity of the wheelbarrow. (In the case of Rifle Regiments the officer will tie his feet in a knot at the back of his neck.) The soldier will then advance six paces, after which the officer will dismount and go home and have a bath.  (b) A soldier, with his arm round a lady's waist in the gloaming, encounters an officer.  _Correct Procedure_.--The soldier will salute with his disengaged arm. The lady will administer a sharp tap with the end of her umbrella to the officer's tunic, at point one inch above the lowest button.  _Correct Acknowledgment_.--The officer will take the end of the umbrella firmly in his right hand, and will require the soldier to introduce him to the lady. He will then direct the soldier to double back to barracks.  (c) A party of soldiers, seated upon the top of a transport waggon, see an officer passing at the side of the road.  _Correct Procedure_.--The senior N.C.O. (or if no N.C.O. be present, the oldest soldier) will call the men to attention, and the party, taking their time from the right, will spit upon the officer's head in a soldier-like manner.  _Correct Acknowledgment_.--The officer will break into a smart trot.  (d) A soldier, driving an officer's motor-car without the knowledge of the officer, encounters the officer in a narrow country lane.  _Correct Procedure_.--The soldier will open the throttle to its full extent and run the officer over.  _Correct Acknowledgment_.--No acknowledgment is required.  NOTE.--_None of the above compliments will be paid upon active service_.  Unfortunately the Colonel came home from dining out sooner than was expected, and found this outrageous document still upon the notice-board. But he was a good Colonel. He merely remarked approvingly--  \"H'm. Quite so! _Non semper arcum tendit Apollo_. It's just as well to keep smiling these days.\"  Nevertheless, Mr. Waddell made a point in future, when in need of information, of seeking the same from a less inspired source than Captain Wagstaffe.         *       *       *       *       *  There was another Law of the Medes and Persians with which our four friends soon became familiar--that which governs the relations of the various ranks to one another. Great Britain is essentially the home of the chaperon. We pride ourselves, as a nation, upon the extreme care with which we protect our young gentlewomen from contaminating influences. But the fastidious attention which we bestow upon our national maidenhood is as nothing in comparison with the protective commotion with which we surround that shrinking sensitive plant, Mr. Thomas Atkins.  Take etiquette and deportment. If a soldier wishes to speak to an officer, an introduction must be effected by a sergeant. Let us suppose that Private M'Splae, in the course of a route-march, develops a blister upon his great toe. He begins by intimating the fact to the nearest lance-corporal. The lance-corporal takes the news to the platoon sergeant, who informs the platoon commander, who may or may not decide to take the opinion of his company commander in the matter. Anyhow, when the hobbling warrior finally obtains permission to fall out and alleviate his distress, a corporal goes with him, for fear he should lose himself, or his boot--it is wonderful what Thomas _can_ lose when he sets his mind to it--or, worst crime of all, his rifle.  Again, if two privates are detailed to empty the regimental ashbin, a junior N.C.O. ranges them in line, calls them to attention, and marches them off to the scene of their labours, decently and in order. If a soldier obtains leave to go home on furlough for the week-end, he is collected into a party, and, after being inspected to see that his buttons are clean, his hair properly cut, and his nose correctly blown, is marched off to the station, where a ticket is provided for him, and he and his fellow-wayfarers are safely tucked into a third-smoker labelled \"Military Party.\" (No wonder he sometimes gets lost on arriving at Waterloo!) In short, if there is a job to be done, the senior soldier present chaperons somebody else while he does it.  This system has been attacked on the ground that it breeds loss of self-reliance and initiative. As a matter of fact, the result is almost exactly the opposite. Under its operation a soldier rapidly acquires the art of placing himself under the command of his nearest superior in rank; but at the same time he learns with equal rapidity to take command himself if no superior be present--no bad thing in times of battle and sudden death, when shrapnel is whistling, and promotion is taking place with grim and unceasing automaticity.  This principle is extended, too, to the enforcement of law and order. If Private M'Sumph is insubordinate or riotous, there is never any question of informal correction or summary justice. News of the incident wends its way upward, by a series of properly regulated channels, to the officer in command. Presently, by the same route, an order comes back, and in a twinkling the offender finds himself taken under arrest and marched off to the guard-room by two of his own immediate associates. (One of them may be his own rear-rank man.) But no officer or non-commissioned officer ever lays a finger on him. The penalty for striking a superior officer is so severe that the law decrees, very wisely, that a soldier must on no account ever be arrested by any save men of his own rank. If Private M'Sumph, while being removed in custody, strikes Private Tosh upon the nose and kicks Private Cosh upon the shin, to the effusion of blood, no great harm is done--except to the lacerated Cosh and Tosh; but if he had smitten an intruding officer in the eye, his punishment would have been dire and grim. So, though we may call military law cumbrous and grandmotherly, there is sound sense and real mercy at the root of it.         *       *       *       *       *  But there is one Law of the Medes and Persians which is sensibly relaxed these days. We, the newly joined, have always been given to understand that whatever else you do, you must never, never betray any interest in your profession--in short, talk shop--at Mess. But in our Mess no one ever talks anything else. At luncheon, we relate droll anecdotes concerning our infant platoons; at tea, we explain, to any one who will listen, exactly how we placed our sentry line in last night's operations; at dinner, we brag about our Company musketry "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12877"],["title","The First Hundred Thousand: Being the Unofficial Chronicle of a Unit of \"K(1)\" (#6)"],["body","returns, and quote untruthful extracts from our butt registers. At breakfast, every one has a newspaper, which he props before him and reads, generally aloud. We exchange observations upon the war news. We criticise von Kluck, and speak kindly of Joffre. We note, daily, that there is nothing to report on the Allies' right, and wonder regularly how the Russians are really getting on in the Eastern theatre.  Then, after observing that the only sportsman in the combined forces of the German Empire is--or was--the captain of the _Emden_, we come to the casualty lists--and there is silence.  Englishmen are fond of saying, with the satisfied air of men letting off a really excellent joke, that every one in Scotland knows every one else. As we study the morning's Roll of Honour, we realise that never was a more truthful jest uttered. There is not a name in the list of those who have died for Scotland which is not familiar to us. If we did not know the man--too often the boy--himself, we knew his people, or at least where his home was. In England, if you live in Kent, and you read that the Northumberland Fusiliers have been cut up or the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry badly knocked about, you merely sigh that so many more good men should have fallen. Their names are glorious names, but they are only names. But never a Scottish regiment comes under fire but the whole of Scotland feels it. Scotland is small enough to know all her sons by heart. You may live in Berwickshire, and the man who has died may have come from Skye; but his name is quite familiar to you. Big England's sorrow is national; little Scotland's is personal.  Then we pass on to our letters. Many of us--particularly the senior officers--have news direct from the trenches--scribbled scraps torn out of field-message books. We get constant tidings of the Old Regiment. They marched thirty-five miles on such a day; they captured a position after being under continuous shell fire for eight hours on another; they were personally thanked by the Field-Marshal on another. Oh, we shall have to work hard to get up to that standard!  \"They want more officers,\" announces the Colonel. \"Naturally, after the time they've been having! But they must go to the Third Battalion for them: that's the proper place. I will not have them coming here: I've told them so at Headquarters. The Service Battalions simply _must_ be led by the officers who have trained them if they are to have a Chinaman's chance when we go out. I shall threaten to resign if they try any more of their tricks. That'll frighten 'em! Even dug-outs like me are rare and valuable objects at present.\"  The Company Commanders murmur assent--on the whole sympathetically. Anxious though they are to get upon business terms with the Kaiser, they are loath to abandon the unkempt but sturdy companies over which they have toiled so hard, and which now, though destitute of blossom, are rich in promise of fruit. But the senior subalterns look up hopefully. Their lot is hard. Some of them have been in the Service for ten years, yet they have been left behind. They command no companies. \"Here,\" their faces say, \"we are merely marking time while others learn. Send _us_!\"         *       *       *       *       *  However, though they have taken no officers yet, signs are not wanting that they will take some soon. To-day each of us was presented with a small metal disc.  Bobby Little examined his curiously. Upon the face thereof was stamped, in ragged, irregular capitals--  [Illustration: LITTLE, R., 2ND LT., B. & W. HIGHRS. C. OF E.]  \"What is this for?\" he asked.  Captain Wagstaffe answered.  \"You wear it round your neck,\" he said.  Our four friends, once bitten, regarded the humorist suspiciously.  \"Are you rotting us?\" asked Waddell cautiously.  \"No, my son,\" replied Wagstaffe, \"I am not.\"  \"What is it for, then?\"  \"It's called an Identity Disc. Every soldier on active service wears one.\"  \"Why should the idiots put one's religion on the thing?\" inquired Master Cockerell, scornfully regarding the letters \"C. of E.\" upon his disc.  Wagstaffe regarded him curiously.  \"Think it over,\" he suggested.     VII  SHOOTING STRAIGHT   \"What for is the wee felly gaun' tae show us puctures?\"  Second Lieutenant Bobby Little, assisted by a sergeant and two unhandy privates, is engaged in propping a large and highly-coloured work of art, mounted on a rough wooden frame and supported on two unsteady legs, against the wall of the barrack square. A half-platoon of A Company, seated upon an adjacent bank, chewing grass and enjoying the mellow autumn sunshine, regard the swaying masterpiece with frank curiosity. For the last fortnight they have been engaged in imbibing the science of musketry. They have learned to hold their rifles correctly, sitting, kneeling, standing, or lying; to bring their backsights and foresights into an undeviating straight line with the base of the bull's-eye; and to press the trigger in the manner laid down in the Musketry Regulations--without wriggling the body or \"pulling-off.\"  They have also learned to adjust their sights, to perform the loading motions rapidly and correctly, and to obey such simple commands as--  \"_At them two, weemen_\"--officers' wives, probably--\"_proceeding from left tae right across the square, at five hundred yairds_\"  --they are really about fifteen yards away, covered with confusion--\"_five roonds, fire!_\"  But as yet they have discharged no shots from their rifles. It has all been make-believe, with dummy cartridges, and fictitious ranges, and snapping triggers. To be quite frank, they are getting just a little tired of musketry training--forgetting for the moment that a soldier who cannot use his rifle is merely an expense to his country and a free gift to the enemy. But the sight of Bobby Little's art gallery cheers them up. They contemplate the picture with childlike interest. It resembles nothing so much as one of those pleasing but imaginative posters by the display of which our Railway Companies seek to attract the tourist to the less remunerative portions of their systems.  \"What for is the wee felly gaun' tae show us puctures?\"  Thus Private Mucklewame. A pundit in the rear rank answers him.  \"Yon's Gairmany.\"  \"Gairmany ma auntie!\" retorts Mucklewame. \"There's no chumney-stalks in Gairmany.\"  \"Maybe no; but there's wundmulls. See the wundmull there--on yon wee knowe!\"  \"There a pit-held!\" exclaims another voice. This homely spectacle is received with an affectionate sigh. Until two months ago more than half the platoon had never been out of sight of at least half a dozen.  \"See the kirk, in ablow the brae!\" says some one else, in a pleased voice. \"It has a nock in the steeple.\"  \"I hear they Gairmans send signals wi' their kirk-nocks,\" remarks Private M'Micking, who, as one of the Battalion signallers--or \"buzzers,\" as the vernacular has it, in imitation of the buzzing of the Morse instrument--regards himself as a sort of junior Staff Officer. \"They jist semaphore with the haunds of the nock--\"  \"I wonder,\" remarks the dreamy voice of Private M'Leary, the humorist of the platoon, \"did ever a Gairman buzzer pit the ba' through his ain goal in a fitba' match?\"  This irrelevant reference to a regrettable incident of the previous Saturday afternoon is greeted with so much laughter that Bobby Little, who has at length fixed his picture in position, whips round.  \"Less talking there!\" he announces severely, \"or I shall have to stand you all at attention!\"  There is immediate silence--there is nothing the matter with Bobby's discipline--and the outraged M'Micking has to content himself with a homicidal glare in the direction of M'Leary, who is now hanging virtuously upon his officer's lips.  \"This,\" proceeds Bobby Little, \"is what is known as a landscape target.\"  He indicates the picture, which, apparently overcome by so much public notice, promptly falls flat upon its face. A fatigue party under the sergeant hurries to its assistance.  \"It is intended,\" resumes Bobby presently, \"to teach you--us--to become familiar with various kinds of country, and to get into the habit of picking out conspicuous features of the landscape, and getting them by heart, and--er--so on. I want you all to study this picture for three minutes. Then I shall face you about and ask you to describe it to me.\"  After three minutes of puckered brows and hard breathing the squad is turned to its rear and the examination proceeds.  \"Lance-Corporal Ness, what did you notice in the foreground of the picture?\"  Lance-Corporal Ness gazes fiercely before him. He has noticed a good deal, but can remember nothing. Moreover, he has no very clear idea what a foreground may be.  \"Private Mucklewame?\"  Again silence, while the rotund Mucklewame perspires in the throes of mental exertion.  \"Private Wemyss?\"  No answer.  \"Private M'Micking!\"  The \"buzzer\" smiles feebly, but says nothing.  \"Well,\"--desperately--\"Sergeant Angus! Tell them what you noticed in the foreground.\"  Sergeant Angus _(floruit_ A.D. 1895) springs smartly to attention, and replies, with the instant obedience of the old soldier--  \"The sky, sirr.\"  \"Not in the foreground, as a rule,\" replies Bobby Little gently. \"About turn again, all of you, and we'll have another try.\"  In his next attempt Bobby abandons individual catechism.  \"Now,\" he begins, \"what conspicuous objects do we notice on this target? In the foreground I can see a low knoll. To the left I see a windmill. In the distance is a tall chimney. Half-right is a church. How would that church be marked on a map?\"  No reply.  \"Well,\" explains Bobby, anxious to parade a piece of knowledge which he only acquired himself a day or two ago, \"churches are denoted in maps by a cross, mounted on a square or circle, according as the church has a square tower or a steeple. What has this church got?\"  \"A nock!\" bellow the platoon, with stunning enthusiasm. (All but Private M'Micking, that is.)  \"A clock,"]]]
