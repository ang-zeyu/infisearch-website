All right: but what I wanted was a steeple. Then, farther away, we can see a mine, a winding brook, and a house, with a wall in front of it. Who can see them?\"  To judge by the collective expression of the audience, no one does. Bobby ploughs on.  \"Upon the skyline we notice--Squad, '_shun!_\"  Captain Wagstaffe has strolled up. He is second in command of A Company. Bobby explains to him modestly what he has been trying to do.  \"Yes, I heard you,\" says Wagstaffe. \"You take a breather, while I carry on for a bit. Squad, stand easy, and tell me what you can see on that target. Lance-Corporal Ness, show me a pit-head.\"  Lance-Corporal Ness steps briskly forward and lays a grubby forefinger on Bobby's \"mine.\"  \"Private Mucklewame, show me a burn.\"  The brook is at once identified.  \"Private M'Leary, shut your eyes and tell me what there is just to the right of the windmill.\"  \"A wee knowe, sirr,\" replies M'Leary at once. Bobby recognises his \"low knoll\"--also the fact that it is no use endeavouring to instruct the unlettered until you have learned their language.  \"Very good!\" says Captain Wagstaffe. \"Now we will go on to what is known as Description and Recognition of Targets. Supposing I had sent one of you forward into that landscape as a scout.--By the way, what is a scout?\"  Dead silence, as usual.  \"Come along! Tell me, somebody! Private Mucklewame?\"  \"They gang oot in a procession on Setter-day efternoons, sirr, in short breeks,\" replies Mucklewame promptly.  \"A procession is the very last thing a scout goes out in!\" raps Wagstaffe. (It is plain to Mucklewame that the Captain has never been in Wishaw, but he does not argue the point.) \"Private M'Micking, what is a scout?\"  \"A spy, sirr,\" replies the omniscient one.  \"Well, that's better; but there's a big difference between the two. What is it?\"  This is a poser. Several men know the difference, but feel quite incapable of explaining it. The question runs down the front rank. Finally it is held up and disposed of by one Mearns (from Aberdeen).  \"A spy, sirr, gets mair money than a scout.\"  \"Does he?\" asks Captain Wagstaffe, smiling. \"Well, I am not in a position to say. But if he does, he earns it! Why?\"  \"Because if he gets catched he gets shot,\" volunteers a rear-rank man.  \"Right. Why is he shot?\"  This conundrum is too deep for the squad. The Captain has to answer it himself.  \"Because he is not in uniform, and cannot therefore be treated as an ordinary prisoner of war. So never go scouting in your nightshirt, Mucklewame!\"  The respectable Mucklewame blushes deeply at this outrageous suggestion, but Wagstaffe proceeds--  \"Now, supposing I sent you out scouting, and you discovered that over there--somewhere in the middle of this field\"--he lays a finger on the field in question--\"there was a fold in the ground where a machine-gun section was concealed: what would you do when you got back?\"  \"I would tell you, sirr,\" replied Private M'Micking politely.  \"Tell me what?\"  \"That they was there, sirr.\"  \"Where?\"  \"In yon place.\"  \"How would you indicate the position of the place?\"  \"I would pint it oot with ma finger, sirr.\"  \"Invisible objects half a mile away are not easily pointed out with the finger,\" Captain Wagstaffe mentions. \"Lance-Corporal Ness, how would you describe it?\"  \"I would tak' you there, sirr.\"  \"Thanks! But I doubt if either of us would come back! Private Wemyss?\"  \"I would say, sirr, that the place was west of the mansion-hoose.\"  \"There's a good deal of land west of that mansion-house, you know,\" expostulates the Captain gently; \"but we are getting on. Thompson?\"  \"I would say, sir,\" replies Thompson, puckering his brow, \"that it was in ablow they trees.\"  \"It would be hard to indicate the exact trees you meant. Trees are too common. You try, Corporal King.\"  But Corporal King, who earned his stripes by reason of physical rather than intellectual attributes, can only contribute a lame reference to \"a bit hedge by yon dyke, where there's a kin' o' hole in the tairget.\" Wagstaffe breaks in--  \"Now, everybody, take some conspicuous and unmistakable object about the middle of that landscape--something which no one can mistake. The mansion-house will do--the near end. Now then--_mansion-house, near end_! Got that?\"  There is a general chorus of assent.  \"Very well. I want you to imagine that the base of the mansion-house is the centre of a great clock-face. Where would twelve o'clock be?\"  The platoon are plainly tickled by this new round-game. They reply--  \"Straught up!\"  \"Right. Where is nine o'clock?\"  \"Over tae the left.\"  \"Very good. And so on with all the other hours. Now, supposing I were to say, _End of mansion-house_--_six o'clock_--_white gate_--you would carry your eye straight _downward_, through the garden, until it encountered the gate. I would thus have enabled you to recognise a very small object in a wide landscape in the quickest possible time. See the idea?\"  \"Yes, sirr.\"  \"All right. Now for our fold in the ground. _End of mansion-house_--_eight o'clock_--got that?\"  There is an interested murmur of assent.  \"That gives you the direction from the house. Now for the distance! _End of mansion-house_--_eight o 'clock_--_two finger-breadths_--what does that give you, Lance-Corporal Ness?\"  \"The corrner of a field, sirr.\"  \"Right. This is _our_ field. We have picked it correctly out of about twenty fields, you see. _Corner of field. In the middle of the field, a fold in the ground. At nine hundred--at the fold in the ground--five rounds--fire_! You see the idea now?\"  \"Yes, sirr.\"  \"Very good. Let the platoon practise describing targets to one another, Mr. Little. Don't be too elaborate. Never employ either the clock or finger method if you can describe your target without. For instance: _Left of windmill_--_triangular cornfield. At the_ _nearest corner_--_six hundred_--_rapid fire!_ is all you want. Carry on, Mr. Little.\"  And leaving Bobby and his infant class to practise this new and amusing pastime, Captain Wagstaffe strolls away across the square to where the painstaking Waddell is contending with another squad.  They, too, have a landscape target--a different one. Before it half a dozen rifles stand, set in rests. Waddell has given the order: _Four hundred_--_at the road, where it passes under the viaduct_--_fire!_ and six privates have laid the six rifles upon the point indicated. Waddell and Captain Wagstaffe walk down the line, peering along the sights of the rifles. Five are correctly aligned: the sixth points to the spacious firmament above the viaduct.  \"Hallo!\" observes Wagstaffe.  \"This is the man's third try, sir,\" explains the harassed Waddell. \"He doesn't seem to be able to distinguish anything at all.\"  \"Eyesight wrong?\"  \"So he says, sir.\"  \"Been a long time finding out, hasn't he?\"  \"The sergeant told me, sir,\" confides Waddell, \"that in his opinion the man is 'working for his ticket.'\"  \"Umph!\"  \"I did not quite understand the expression, sir,\" continues the honest youth, \"so I thought I would consult you.\"  \"It means that he is trying to get his discharge. Bring him along: I'll soon find out whether he is skrim-shanking or not.\"  Private M'Sweir is introduced, and led off to the lair of that hardened cynic, the Medical Officer. Here he is put through some simple visual tests. He soon finds himself out of his depth. It is extremely difficult to feign either myopia, hypermetria, or astigmatism if you are not acquainted with the necessary symptoms, and have not decided beforehand which (if any) of these diseases you are suffering from. In five minutes the afflicted M'Sweir is informed, to his unutterable indignation, that he has passed a severe ocular examination with flying colours, and is forthwith marched back to his squad, with instructions to recognise all targets in future, under pain of special instruction in the laws of optics during his leisure hours. Verily, in K (1)--that is the tabloid title of the First Hundred Thousand--the way of the malingerer is hard.  Still, the seed does not always fall upon stony ground. On his way to inspect a third platoon Captain Wagstaffe passes Bobby Little and his merry men. They are in pairs, indicating targets to one another.  Says Private Walker (oblivious of Captain Wagstaffe's proximity) to his friend, Private M'Leary--in an affected parody of his instructor's staccato utterance--  \"_At yon three Gairman spies, gaun' up a close for tae despatch some wireless telegraphy_--_fufty roonds_--_fire_!\"  To which Private M'Leary, not to be outdone, responds--  \"_Public hoose_--_in the baur_--_back o' seeven o'clock_--_twa drams_--_fower fingers_--_rapid!\"_   II  From this it is a mere step to--  \"Butt Pairty, '_shun!_ Forrm fourrs! Right! By your left, quick _marrch_!\"  --on a bleak and cheerless morning in late October. It is not yet light; but a depressed party of about twenty-five are falling into line at the acrid invitation of two sergeants, who have apparently decided that the pen is mightier than the Lee-Enfield rifle; for each wears one stuck in his glengarry like an eagle's feather, and carries a rabbinical-looking inkhorn slung to his bosom. This literary pose is due to the fact that records are about to be taken of the performances of the Company on the shooting-range.  A half-awakened subaltern, who breakfasted at the grisly hour of a quarter-to-six, takes command, and the dolorous procession disappears into the gloom.  Half an hour later the Battalion parades, and sets off, to the sound of music, in pursuit. (It is perhaps needless to state that although we are deficient in rifles, possess neither belts, pouches, nor greatcoats, and are compelled to attach, our scanty accoutrements to our persons with ingenious contrivances of string, we boast a fully equipped and highly efficient pipe band, complete with pipers, big drummer, side drummers, and corybantic drum-major.)  By eight o'clock, after a muddy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12877"],["title","The First Hundred Thousand: Being the Unofficial Chronicle of a Unit of \"K(1)\" (#8)"],["body","of four miles, we are assembled at the two-hundred-yards firing point upon Number Three Range. The range itself is little more than a drive cut through, a pine-wood. It is nearly half a mile long. Across the far end runs a high sandy embankment, decorated just below the ridge with, a row of number-boards--one for each target. Of the targets themselves nothing as yet is to be seen.  \"Now then, let's get a move on!\" suggests the Senior Captain briskly. \"Cockerell, ring up the butts, and ask Captain Wagstaffe to put up the targets.\"  The alert Mr. Cockerell hurries to the telephone, which lives in a small white-painted structure like a gramophone-stand. (It has been left at the firing-point by the all-providing butt-party.) He turns the call-handle smartly, takes the receiver out of the box, and begins....  There is no need to describe the performance which ensues. All telephone-users are familiar with it. It consists entirely of the word \"Hallo!\" repeated _crescendo_ and _furioso_ until exhaustion supervenes.  Presently Mr. Cockerell reports to the Captain--  \"Telephone out of order, sir.\"  \"I never knew a range telephone that wasn't,\" replies the Captain, inspecting the instrument. \"Still, you might give this one a sporting chance, anyhow. It isn't a _wireless_ telephone, you know! Corporal Kemp, connect that telephone for Mr. Cockerell.\"  A marble-faced N.C.O. kneels solemnly upon the turf and raises a small iron trapdoor--hitherto overlooked by the omniscient Cockerell--revealing a cavity some six inches deep, containing an electric plug-hole. Into this he thrusts the terminal of the telephone wire. Cockerell, scarlet in the face, watches him indignantly.  Telephonic communication between firing-point and butts is now established. That is to say, whenever Mr. Cockerell rings the bell some one in the butts courteously rings back. Overtures of a more intimate nature are greeted either with stony silence or another fantasia on the bell.  Meanwhile the captain is superintending firing arrangements.  \"Are the first details ready to begin?\" he shouts.  \"Quite ready, sir,\" runs the reply down the firing line.  The Captain now comes to the telephone himself. He takes the receiver from Cockerell with masterful assurance.  \"Hallo, there!\" he calls. \"I want to speak to Captain Wagstaffe.\"  \"Honkle yang-yang?\" inquires a ghostly voice.  \"Captain Wagstaffe! Hurry up!\"  Presently the bell rings, and the Captain gets to business.  \"That you, Wagstaffe?\" he inquires cheerily. \"Look here, we're going to fire Practice Seven, Table B,--snap-shooting. I want you to raise all the targets for six seconds, just for sighting purposes. Do you understand?\"  Here the bell rings continuously for ten seconds. Nothing daunted, the Captain tries again.  \"That you, Wagstaffe? Practice Seven, Table B!\"  \"T'chk, t'chk!\" replies Captain Wagstaffe.  \"Begin by raising all the targets for six seconds. Then raise them six times for five seconds each.--no, as you were! Raise them five times for six seconds each. Got that? I say, are you _there_? What's that?\"  \"_Przemysl_\" replies the telephone--or something to that effect. \"_Czestochowa! Krsyszkowice! Plock_!\"  The Captain, now on his mettle, continues:--  \"I want you to signal the results on the rear targets as the front ones go down. After that we will fire--oh, _curse_ the thing!\"  He hastily removes the receiver, which is emitting sounds suggestive of the buckling of biscuit-tins, from his ear, and lays it on its rest. The bell promptly begins to ring again.  \"Mr. Cockerell,\" he says resignedly, \"double up to the butts and ask Captain Wagstaffe--\"  \"I'm here, old son,\" replies a gentle voice, as Captain Wagstaffe touches him upon the shoulder. \"Been here some time!\"  After mutual asperities, it is decided by the two Captains to dispense with the aid of the telephone proper, and communicate by bell alone. Captain Wagstaffe's tall figure strides back across the heather; the red flag on the butts flutters down; and we get to work.  Upon a long row of waterproof sheets--some thirty in all--lie the firers. Beside each is extended the form of a sergeant or officer, tickling his charge's ear with incoherent counsel, and imploring him, almost tearfully, not to get excited.  Suddenly thirty targets spring out of the earth in front of us, only to disappear again just as we have got over our surprise. They are not of the usual bull's-eye pattern, but are what is known as \"figure\" targets. The lower half is sea-green, the upper, white. In the centre, half on the green and half on the white, is a curious brown smudge. It might be anything, from a splash of mud to one of those mysterious brown-paper patterns which fall out of ladies' papers, but it really is intended to represent the head and shoulders of a man in khaki lying on grass and aiming at us. However, the British private, with his usual genius for misapprehension, has christened this effigy \"the beggar in the boat.\"  With equal suddenness the targets swing up again. Crack! An uncontrolled spirit has loosed off his rifle before it has reached his shoulder. Blistering reproof follows. Then, after three or four seconds, comes a perfect salvo all down the line. The conscientious Mucklewame, slowly raising his foresight as he has been taught to do, from the base of the target to the centre, has just covered the beggar in the boat between wind and water, and is lingering lovingly over the second pull, when the inconsiderate beggar (and his boat) sink unostentatiously into the abyss, leaving the open-mouthed marksman with his finger on the trigger and an unfired cartridge still in the chamber. At the dentist's Time crawls; in snap-shooting contests he sprints.  Another set of targets slide up as the first go down, and upon these the hits are recorded by a forest of black or white discs, waving vigorously in the air. Here and there a red-and-white flag flaps derisively. Mucklewame gets one of these.  The marking-targets go down to half-mast again, and then comes another tense pause. Then, as the firing-targets reappear, there is another volley. This time Private Mucklewame leads the field, and decapitates a dandelion. The third time he has learned wisdom, and the beggar in the boat gets the bullet where all mocking foes should get it--in the neck!  Snap-shooting over, the combatants retire to the five-hundred-yards firing-point, taking with them that modern hair-shirt, the telephone.  Presently a fresh set of targets swing up--of the bull's-eye variety this time--and the markers are busy once more.   III  The interior of the butts is an unexpectedly spacious place. From the nearest firing-point you would not suspect their existence, except when the targets are up. Imagine a sort of miniature railway station--or rather, half a railway station--sunk into the ground, with a very long platform and a very low roof--eight feet high at the most. Upon the opposite side of this station, instead of the other platform, rises the sandy ridge previously mentioned--the stop-butt--crowned with its row of number-boards. Along the permanent way, in place of sleepers and metals, runs a long and narrow trough, in which, instead of railway carriages, some thirty great iron frames are standing side by side. These frames are double, and hold the targets. They are so arranged that if one is pushed up the other comes down. The markers stand along the platform, like railway porters.  There are two markers to each target. They, stand with their backs to the firers, comfortably conscious of several feet of earth and a stout brick wall, between them and low shooters. Number one squats down, paste-pot in hand, and repairs the bullet-holes in the unemployed target with patches of black or white paper. Number two, brandishing a pole to which is attached a disc, black on one side and white on the other, is acquiring a permanent crick in the neck through gaping upwards at the target in search of hits. He has to be sharp-eyed, for the bullet-hole is a small one, and springs into existence without any other intimation than a spirt of sand on the bank twenty yards behind. He must be alert, too, and signal the shots as they are made; otherwise the telephone will begin to interest itself on his behalf. The bell will ring, and a sarcastic voice will intimate--assuming that you can hear what it says--that C Company are sending a wreath and message of condolence as their contribution to the funeral of the marker at Number Seven target, who appears to have died at his post within the last ten minutes; coupled with a polite request that his successor may be appointed as rapidly as possible, as the war is not likely to last more than three years. To this the butt-officer replies that C Company had better come a bit closer to the target and try, try again.  There are practically no restrictions as to the length to which one may go in insulting butt-markers. The Geneva Convention is silent upon the subject, partly because it is almost impossible to say anything which can really hurt a marker's feelings, and partly because the butt-officer always has the last word in any unpleasantness which may arise. That is to say, when defeated over the telephone, he can always lower his targets, and with his myrmidons feign abstraction or insensibility until an overheated subaltern arrives at the double from the five-hundred-yards firing-point, conveying news of surrender.  Captain Wagstaffe was an admitted master of this game. He was a difficult subject to handle, for he was accustomed to return an eye for an eye when repartees were being exchanged; and when overborne by heavier metal--say, a peripatetic \"brass-hat\" from Hythe--he was accustomed to haul up the red butt-flag (which automatically brings all firing to a standstill), and stroll down the range to refute the intruder at close quarters. We must add that he was a most efficient butt-officer. When he was on duty, markers were most assiduous in"]]]
