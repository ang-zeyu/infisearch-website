But thar's no one to write 'Very Good' on 'em any mo', an' I reckon thar an't goin' to be. But I'm trustin' that you'll fin' him an' you'll tell him that he an't fo'gotten.\"  Without a word of farewell, the boy struck into the woods and was lost to sight. The two lads started on their way, but they had not ridden a hundred yards when they heard a hail; looking back, they saw the mountain boy standing on a point of the ridge; and echoing down to them came the lonely cry:  \"Fin' him, an' tell him he an't fo'gotten.\"     CHAPTER III  A MANUFACTORY OF RIFLES   Settling himself comfortably in the train for his long journey to the capital, one of the first things that Hamilton did was to take from his pocket the little carving that had been given him by the mountain lad and put it away carefully in his grip. Examining it closely as he did so, the boy was astonished to note the fineness of the work, and he realized that it must have taken Bill Wilsh all the spare moments of a long winter to finish it. The work was all the more surprising, Hamilton thought, since it had been done just with a single tool, a common pocketknife, and was yet as fine and delicate as though carved with a set of costly tools. He made up his mind to buy a set and send them to Bill Wilsh with the first pay that he got from his Census Bureau work.  Seated across the aisle from him was another lad about his own age, with whom Hamilton rather wanted to make acquaintance, but the opportunity did not arrive until the first meal, when, by chance, they found themselves on opposite sides of one of the small tables in the dining car. The usual courtesies of the table led to conversation, in the course of which Hamilton's companion dropped the word \"census\" in a manner which showed his familiarity with the progress of the work of preparation.  \"Are you interested in the census?\" asked Hamilton promptly.  \"Rather,\" the other replied. \"I'm going to work in the Bureau. As a matter of fact, I'm just going to Washington to get my appointment now.\"  \"You are!\" exclaimed Hamilton. \"Why, that's exactly what I'm doing. It's queer we should meet this way.\"  \"Are you going as an assistant special agent, too?\" his new friend asked.  \"I'm going to start in that way,\" the boy replied  \"How do you mean 'start'?\" the other queried. \"I understand that work on the manufactures will last three or four months, and by that time all the other census-taking will be over.\"  \"I'm going to try to get some of the population work as well,\" Hamilton explained. \"I think it will be even more fun than the manufactures end, and I heard that they're going to put on a few population enumerators from those who have been on the manufactures work, admitting them without an exam. I think the population census gathering will be fine.\"  The other boy shook his head.  \"I don't think I'd want it,\" he said, \"at least not in a city, and I'm going to do the manufacturing work, of course, in a city.\"  \"Where are you going to be?\" asked Hamilton.  \"I took the exam in 'Frisco,\" the older boy replied; \"that's my home town, and I expect to work out there.\"  \"That's quite a walk from here!\" exclaimed Hamilton.  \"I had to come to Washington,\" the boy answered \"and so my people wanted me to go and see my sister down in Florida. She married a fellow who's busy reclaiming some swamp land down there, and he promised me a try at alligator hunting.\"  \"That sounds prime,\" suggested Hamilton, \"and I should think that in that reclamation work there would be lots of chance for it. It would be worth watching, too, just to see how they got at that work. I should think they would find themselves up against a pretty stiff job, engineering down in those swamps. And then there must be barrels of snakes, too?\"  [Illustration: ALLIGATOR-CATCHING. The sport at its best; tackling a fair sized reptile with bare hands. (_Courtesy of Outing Magazine._)]  \"Water moccasins and copper-heads mostly,\" said his friend cheerfully, \"but you soon get so used to them that you don't mind them. It's very seldom that you ever hear of any one being bitten by a snake. They all seem more anxious to get out of your way than you out of theirs.\"  \"And you're anxious enough, too!\" remarked Hamilton.  \"That's pretty good security, don't you think?\" queried the older boy with a laugh. \"When both sides want to get away, there's not much chance of a meeting.\"  \"But how about the alligators?\"  \"That was real good sport,\" the other rejoined. \"But I kept down to the smaller chaps most of the time. I don't suppose there's really very much danger, even in the big fellows, as long as you know just how to handle them.\"  \"I don't think I'm particularly keen about handling them,\" answered Hamilton. \"I shouldn't think the big ones would want more than about one bite to put you out of business.\"  \"That's all right,\" the older boy admitted, \"but what's the use of giving one that chance? Anyway, so I learned down there, it's not so much the bite that the hunters are afraid of as the stroke of the tail. It doesn't take such a big alligator to break your leg like a pipestem with a sweep of that long, scaly tail of his.\"  \"But how do they catch them?\"  \"With a noose, when they're sunning themselves. An alligator lies on a bank, half in and half out of the water, most of the time, with his eyes shut. Sometimes he really is asleep, and sometimes he isn't. That's where the fun comes in. Of course, if you can get the boat right up to where he is, close enough to slip the noose over his jaws, you've got him all right. There's a knob on the snout that keeps the noose from slipping off, and he sort of strangles when you tow him through the water. But if you can't get there with the boat you have to go it on foot.\"  \"You mean you have to get out of the boat and walk right up to his jaws?\"  \"Yes, just that.\"  \"It doesn't sound particularly good to me,\" Hamilton remarked.  \"It isn't nearly as bad as it sounds,\" the other replied. \"As long as you don't make too much noise, and keep out of reach of his tail, you're all right. If you slip up, you want to jump out of the way about as lively as you know how. But he'll never come after you, or mighty seldom. If you get a slip-knot over his snout, and can throw a half-hitch over his tail, why, the biggest of them is easy enough to handle.\"  \"But what are they caught for?\"  \"There's quite a steady sale. The big fellows are sometimes sold alive to parks and aquariums and circuses, but most of them are killed and the whole skins dressed and used for hanging on the walls of dens, like trophies. The real market is for the skins of the little fellows, which are made up into all sorts of alligator leather bags. Most of that stuff is imitation, but still quite a lot of it is real. It's plenty of fun catching the little 'gators, because even the smallest of them can give you quite a nip and a reptile three feet long is a handful. I did well enough out of it, because in addition to the sport I had, my brother-in-law let me have the skins of all those I caught myself. Some people, too, want to have baby ones as pets, but I don't think I'd want to have them around, myself, after they grew to any size,\" he added, as the boys rose and went back to the Pullman.  By the time the train had reached Washington the two had become thoroughly friendly, and Hamilton liked his new acquaintance so much that he would gladly have seen more of him than merely as a traveling companion. But as the other lad was going out to San Francisco, there was no likelihood of their being thrown together at all. Indeed, on his arrival, Hamilton found that he had been assigned to an Eastern city, so he had to bid his new-made friend \"Good-by.\"  The exterior of the Census Bureau building was a disappointment to Hamilton, by reason of its unimposing appearance. Indeed, it was altogether too small for the purposes of the census, and during the rush of the decennial work, there were departments of the census scattered through various other buildings, adding no little inconvenience to the work. Accustomed to the New York structures, towering tens of stories into the air, the two-story red brick building of the census looked small to Hamilton, though comfortable and pleasant to work in. It was deceiving in its size, however, for the floor space was big and not much broken, and there seemed to be plenty of room. But it was not until the boy returned after his population work some months later, that he saw this building as the center of unparalleled activity.  [Illustration: THE CENSUS BUILDING. Where Hamilton learned the immense importance of this great function of the government. (_Walden Fawcett._)]  \"I understand,\" said the chief of the manufacturing division to him, \"that you are desirous of coming to the Census Bureau as one of the permanent force, not just for the decennial period only?\"  \"Yes, Mr. Clan,\" was the boy's reply, \"that is, if the Bureau is willing.\"  \"That will depend entirely on the work you do. I didn't see your papers personally, but I understand you received a high rating, and that you have had a good deal to do with figures.--That is, for a youngster,\" he added, noting the youthfulness of the lad standing before him.  \"Yes, sir, I have,\" answered Hamilton.  \"What made you think of taking this work up?\" was the next question.  \"Because I like it, sir.\"  The divisional chief leaned back in his chair, put his fingers together in characteristic attitude, and smiled.  \"Eh,\" he said, \"you are sure you will like the work?\"  \"Quite, sir,\" said Hamilton in his decided way. \"I looked it all over, and I know.\"  \"You will be less sure of the future when you are older,\" the Scotchman said, \"but if you 'know,' there's nothing more to be said. I'm going to put you under the care of Mr. Burns, and he will instruct you further in the work."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13181"],["title","The Boy With the U.S. Census (#7)"],["body","\"  \"But, Mr. Clan--\" began the boy.  \"Well?\"  \"Where am I going, sir?\"  \"New Haven, Connecticut--a good town, and one that will give you plenty of work. You'd better start for there to-night. I hope you will like it as much as you expect.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Hamilton replied, seeing that his superior deemed the interview at an end. \"I'll do the very best I can.\"  On arriving in New Haven the following day, Hamilton made his way to the local Census Office opened by his new leader. He found Mr. Burns to be a typical statistician, to whom figures had a meaning beyond themselves, but to whom little was of value unless it could be expressed in figures. Hamilton introduced himself briefly.  \"You're Noble,\" the other said abruptly. \"When will you be ready to begin?\"  \"Any time,\" answered Hamilton. \"Right after lunch, sir, if you want me to make a start.\"  \"There's a portfolio,\" the census agent answered, \"take it along and you can begin just as soon as you're ready.\"  \"What instructions have you to give me, sir?\" asked Hamilton.  \"I save eleven and a half per cent of the time given to instructions by writing them. You'll find a copy in there,\" he said, pointing to the portfolio.  \"Very well, sir,\" the boy replied, \"I'll go ahead, and if I find anything I don't understand, shall I come and ask you?\"  \"Telephone!\" the census agent said. \"Quicker to 'phone even if only in the next room. Average conversation, six minutes; average telephone conversation, two minutes; average value of my time for six minutes, eighteen cents; average cost of 'phone for two minutes, one cent; direct saving to me seventeen cents, not counting time of your traveling to come and talk. No! Telephone!\"  \"All right, sir,\" Hamilton answered, \"I'll 'phone,\" and realizing that his new chief had the question of the valuation of time down to a fine point, he hurried away.  On reaching the hotel he examined his portfolio with a great deal of curiosity. The schedules were familiar, for one of the features of the examination he had taken had been the filling out of such a census schedule from financial statements of a group of factories. The written instructions, however, were thoroughly characteristic of the man, and percentage figures were scattered around like punctuation marks. But the explanations were clear as crystal, none the less, and gave no opportunity even for telephoning.  An old New England center, and a college town, New Haven proved a most interesting field in which to work. By far the larger number of people with whom the boy came in contact were of old American stock and gave him every assistance possible.  \"The census-taker?\" one old man said, when Hamilton called. \"Come right in the office and sit down. Now tell me what I can do for you,\" and when the boy mentioned the principal items of the schedule, the manufacturer spent a good hour working over the books with his office force to get out the figures desired. When Hamilton thanked him, he replied:  \"I'm an American, Mr. Noble, and one of the stones they moved from the old churchyard of the Old Center Church and that bore the date 1681 was the tombstone of my direct ancestor. I think you'll find most of the New England stock proud of the United States and only too glad to do anything they can to help the government in its census or anything else for the good of the country.\"  \"I'm sure of it,\" the boy said heartily, \"but there's mighty few of that old type left. There's not ten per cent of the people in the country now that are real bred-in-the-bone Americans.\"  \"It is a pity,\" the old man said, shaking his head, \"and the worst of it is that even that ten per cent lives principally in the country. It's the cities that influence the progress of the nation. We talk about making these foreigners over into our idea of what Americans should be, and we forget that all the time they are influencing us to become the kind of Americans they think we ought to be.\"  \"I guess that's true,\" the boy said, \"because in New York, where my folks live, the old New Yorkers seem entirely strange and out-of-place in the dash and glitter.\"  \"Of course,\" the New Englander replied. \"The real Americans are plain, solid people; it's the Jewish strain in New York that has brought about the display of wealth, and to the large number of Southern Europeans are due the colors, the lights, the music, the public dining, and all the rest of it. It may be the American of to-day, but it isn't what Americanism meant a few years ago.\"  \"A good deal of New York life does seem foreign in a kind of way,\" said Hamilton, \"and I'm glad,\" he added, as he closed his portfolio, \"that the Census Bureau put me at work in one of the old-fashioned towns first.\"  As the boy went on in his work he came to find how thoroughly the spirit of Yale was felt in the town. Almost all the leading business men were Yale graduates, and instead of displaying the \"town and gown\" hostility of some university places, New Haven was inordinately proud of its college. Of course, even in such a town, there was quite a proportion of foreign-born manufacturers but the boy found that the Jewish establishments were even easier to tabulate than those owned by Americans, the Hebrew understanding of the details of business being so thorough.  \"That's not so very detailed!\" one of these remarked to Hamilton when the boy had come to the end of his list of questions.  \"It's a relief to hear somebody say that,\" answered the young census-taker with a laugh, \"because I hear a dozen times a day the complaint that no one could be expected to know as much about a business as these schedules require.\"  It was not to be expected that the work would proceed without an occasional hitch, and Hamilton had one such with a firm of Italian marble-cutters in which the bookkeeping had been of so curious a character that it was next to impossible to get out the kind of figures the government wanted. Another was in a small Chinese place, where they made little trinkets to sell to tourists in the \"Chinatown\" districts of the larger cities, representing them to be imported articles of value. Another was with a small place run by two brothers, Persians, making fringes and tassels for fraternal order badges and matters of that kind. It was interesting to the lad, for he had the chance to see the works in a number of cases, and he learned a lot about the way many queer things were made.  But Hamilton's hopes were set on visiting one especial manufacturing plant in New Haven, and he had determined to ask that he be allowed to go over it before he left the town. This was the great sporting gun works. Hamilton was passionately fond of sport, and had owned a Winchester ever since he was twelve years old. Indeed, he had read up on guns a good deal, and it was one of his hobbies.  His delight was great, therefore, when at the end of a long day, after he had turned in his schedule to his chief, the latter said:  \"Noble, your work is good. Johnson is faster. Up to last night he had turned in one, decimal five-two per cent more establishments than you, but your proportion of capital invested is larger, showing that the works you went to took more time. Your schedules are better. This takes a little over one-fifth more of my own time than I had figured at first. I was going to do the Winchester works myself. I think you can do it. You had better go ahead. It's complicated, but they'll help you all they can. There's not much time left.\"  \"Very well, Mr. Burns,\" said Hamilton decisively with the characteristic raising and lowering of his eyebrows, \"I'll get all there is, all right.\"  The next morning, about ten o'clock, Hamilton presented himself at the general offices of the company on the outskirts of the town, about a mile from the college. He asked to see the business manager, and was granted an interview.  \"Mr. Arverne,\" said the boy, \"I called with regard to securing the figures for the census of nineteen hundred and ten.\"  \"But you are not the special agent surely?\" said the manager, looking at him sharply.  \"No, sir,\" the boy answered, \"Mr. Burns is the special agent, and I am one of his assistants.\"  \"I should have thought Mr. Burns would have come himself,\" the man said; \"you are young for this work, aren't you?\"  Hamilton flushed at this reference to his boyish appearance, but he answered steadily: \"Yes, sir, I believe I am younger than most of the assistant special agents, but I have had a good deal to do with figures.\"  \"Burns is a good man,\" the manager continued. \"If the government has men of that stamp all over the country, the statistics will be invaluable. You know Mr. Burns?\" he added suddenly.  \"Only just since this work began, Mr. Arverne,\" the boy replied.  \"Queer chap. I don't believe he eats a bit of food or drinks a glass of water without mentally figuring the nutritious percentage in the food, and the effect of his drink upon the water supply of the world.\"  Hamilton laughed.  \"He is a little that way, sir,\" he said.  \"A little!\" the manager exclaimed. \"But to return to the point. You didn't tell me why Mr. Burns didn't come himself.\"  \"He said that the office work was piling up, sir,\" answered the boy, \"and--if you don't mind my saying so, Mr. Arverne--he spoke of it as an opportunity for me, since it was the largest plant in the city and my schedules had been the most complete of those turned in to him.\"  The manager eyed the boy keenly.  \"Mr. Burns doesn't make many mistakes,\" he said, after a moment, \"and if he has confidence in you, he knows what he is talking about. This is a country of young men anyway, and it seems to be getting younger all the time. Where is the schedule?\"  Hamilton handed him the paper and sat back, waiting. Several minutes passed, while the manager went over the questions item by item.  \"Yes,\" he said at last, \"I think our books can answer every question there without difficulty. We keep very complete books. I am not so sure, Mr. Noble,\" he"]]]
