The young men were led before the midshipmen's pay officer, with whom each deposited the sum of two hundred and sixty-four dollars and ninety-eight cents.  This amount from each new midshipman is required by law. Of this sum sixty dollars is applied to the purchase of books needed by the new midshipman.  The balance of the sum goes to pay for uniforms, articles of equipment, etc.  From this it would seem that an absolutely poor boy had no chance to enter the Naval Academy.  It usually happens, however, that, when a very poor boy is appointed to the Naval Academy, his Congressman, or some of his friends or fellow townsmen will loan him the money, returnable after he enters the service as an officer.  In addition to the amount required by law to be deposited with the Academy authorities each midshipman is ordered to turn over any other money that may be in his possession, this extra amount to be credited to him.  A midshipman, on entering the service, receives a salary of six hundred dollars a year.  Nearly all of this, however, is required to pay his ordinary expenses.  Each midshipman is allowed a very small amount of spending money, with, however, a more liberal allowance when visiting ports during a cruise.  It is forbidden for a midshipman to receive spending money from home or friends.  Midshipmen sometimes disobey this latter regulation, but, if detected, are liable to severe punishment.  Afterwards the new midshipmen were taken to the storekeeper's, where each was supplied with one of the uniform caps worn by midshipmen.  Thence the young men were marched back to Bancroft Hall and out onto the terrace over the mess hall.  \"Halt!  Break ranks!\" commanded their instructor, Midshipman Cranthorpe. \"You will now pay close heed and endeavor to learn rapidly.  Mr. Darrin, step over here.\"  Dave went forward, Midshipman Cranthorpe placing him.  \"The others will form in line of platoon front, using Mr. Darrin as their guide,\" directed the young instructor.  Then followed some rapid-fire drilling in dressing, facings, counting fours, marching and halting.  The material in hand was excellent, or Midshipman Cranthorpe might have been in despair.  Presently their instructor gave the order to break ranks, showing the new men where to stand, up against the building, out of the way.  Almost immediately a bugler sounded a call.  Then the new men were treated to a sight that made their blood dance.  Out of Bancroft Hall hastily poured scores and scores of midshipmen, until nearly six hundred had assembled.  These were the members of the three upper classes.  The brigade of midshipmen is divided into two battalions, each of two divisions, six companies.  The first and fourth companies formed on the right of the first battalion, the seventh and tenth companies on the right of the second battalion.  The divisions formed with intervals of two paces between companies preparatory to muster.  Second call was sounded quickly on the bugle, immediately after which the first petty officer of each company began briskly to call the roll.  Each man answered just loudly enough to be heard.  While roll-call was going on company commanders stepped briskly along inspecting their companies.  As the muster of each company was completed the first petty officer commanded, \"count off!\"  \"One, two, three, four!  One, two, three four!\" went the count along each company line.  Then the first petty officer of each company wheeled about, saluted his company commander, and reported:  \"Sir, all present or accounted for!\"  Company commanders next corrected the alignment on the right center company of each line.  Battalion commanders, seeing the divisions of their respective battalions aligned, faced about, while the battalion adjutants took post to right and rear.  The brigade adjutant then faced about, saluted the brigade commander, reporting: \"Sir, the brigade is formed.\"  Receiving the word from his superior, the brigade adjutant next read the orders, after which he was ordered to take his post.  While this was going on Midshipman Cranthorpe had formed his awkward squad to the rear, behind the first battalion.  Now orders rang out crisply for battalion commanders to take charge. Thereupon each battalion commander marched his command in column of squads into the mess hall; battalion commanders preceding their battalions, company commanders preceding their companies and the junior officers of each company following the company.  Last of all came Midshipman Cranthorpe's awkward squad.  And very awkward, indeed, these young men felt.  Each had a burning conviction that he was being watched curiously by hundreds of pairs of eyes.  The new men might as well have saved themselves their worry.  Barely an upper class man in the hall was paying any heed whatever to these self-conscious plebes.  The meal, a mid-day dinner, was an excellent one.  Few of the new men, however, had any notion of what it consisted.  Mess hall was left with almost the same amount of formality. In the short recreation period that followed the new men, painfully conscious that their caps were the only part of the uniform they wore, were hurried away by Midshipman Cranthorpe.  Now they were quickly assigned to the rooms that they would occupy during their first year at the Naval Academy.  The midshipmen are not roomed by classes.  Instead, each is assigned to a company, and there are three companies to a division.  Each division occupies a floor in Bancroft Hall.  It is not called a \"floor\" but a \"deck.\"  Dave and Dan were assigned to the armory wing of the lowest deck, on what was virtually the basement floor of Bancroft Hall, or would have been, but for the mess hall underneath.  As far as wood work went it was a handsome room.  When it came to the matter of furniture it was plain enough.  There was the main or study room.  Off at either side was an alcove bedroom. There was also a closet in which stood a shower bath.  The one window of the room looked over across the Academy grounds in the direction of Academic Hall.  A cadet petty officer from the first class briefly, crisply instructed them concerning the care of their room, and their duties within its walls.  What followed that afternoon put the heads of the new midshipmen in a whirl.  Afterwards they had a confused recollection of having been marched to the tailor at the storekeeper's, where they were measured for uniforms, all of which are made to order.  They recalled receiving a thin, blue volume entitled \"Regulations of the U.S. Naval Academy,\" a book which they were advised by a first clansman instructor to \"commit to memory.\"  \"In former days, in the old-time academy, there were something more than six hundred regulations,\" dryly remarked the cadet petty officer in charge of them.  \"In the new up-to-date Naval Academy there are now more than one thousand regulations.  You are all expected to appreciate this merciful decrease in the number of things you are required to remember.\"  There were also two periods of drill, that afternoon, and what-not more.  Supper came as a merciful release.  When the meal was over, while many of the upper class men remained outside in the warm June air, the plebes were ordered to go to their rooms and start in making themselves familiar with the thousand-and-more regulations.  \"Thank goodness they give us some time for light reading,\" muttered Dan Dalzell, as he stalked into his room, hung up his uniform cap and sank into a chair.  \"Whew!  What a day this has been!\"  \"I've rather enjoyed it,\" murmured Dave, as he sank into the chair on the opposite side of the study table.  \"Huh!  You have liberal ideas, then, about enjoyment.  How many hundred rules are you going to commit to memory tonight?  \"I don't know,\" returned Dave.  \"But I do know that my head is in a big whirl, and that I'm going to rest it for a few minutes. By the way, Dan, there's one thing I hope you remember.\"  \"What is that?\" demanded Dalzell.  \"What did they tell us this lower deck was named?\"  \"Dunno,\" grunted Dan.  \"But I have my own name for it.  _I_ call it the pinochle deck.\"  \"I'm afraid that won't do to repeat,\" laughed Dave.  At that moment the handle of the door was turned.  Five upper class midshipmen entered, closing the door behind them.  Then they stood there, glaring at the two poor plebes in \"cit.\" clothes.     CHAPTER III  A TASTE OF HAZING   \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" nodded Dave pleasantly, as he rose and stood by the study table, waiting to hear the pleasure of his visitors.  Dan Dalzell favored his callers with a nod, but remained seated, both hands thrust deep in his pockets.  \"Get up on your feet, mister!\" ordered one of the midshipmen, so sternly that Dan obeyed like a shot.  \"Excuse me,\" he began hastily.  \"I didn't know you came here in an official capacity.  I thought--\"  \"Silence, mister!\" commanded another of the visitors.  Dan subsided.  \"What's your name, mister?\" demanded the last speaker, as he favored Dave with his next glance.  \"Why, my name is Dave Darrin,\" replied that plebe pleasantly.  \"Say 'sir,' mister, when you address an upper class man.  When asked your name, reply, 'Darrin, sir.'\"  \"Darrin, sir,\" replied Dave promptly.  \"Stand at attention, both of you!\" commanded another visitor.  Both plebes obeyed.  Now still another caller wheeled upon Dan.  \"What's your name, mister.\"  \"Dan Dalzell.\"  \"Dalzell--Sir!\" thundered Dan's questioner.  \"Dalzell, sir,\" Dan responded meekly enough.  \"It is plain enough that both of you plebes need a good deal of practice in the use of the word, sir.  Therefore, in your next answers, you will be careful to employ 'sir' after each word that you utter in your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],["title","Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#4)"],["body","ly.  Mister,\" to Dave, \"what did you come to the Naval Academy for?\"  \"To, sir, become, sir, a sir, Naval, sir, officer.  Sir.\"  \"Very good, mister.  Mister,\" to Dalzell, \"why did you come here?\"  \"For sir, the same pur--\"  \"Sir, sir, sir, sir!\" interrupted the quizzer.  \"Now, try again, mister.\"  \"For, sir, the, sir, same, sir, purpose, sir.\"  \"Now, mister,\" continued the quizzing visitor, transfixing Dalzell with a look of tremendous sternness, \"can you talk French?\"  Dan's eyes twinkled briefly.  \"I don't know, sir.  I never tried, sir,\" replied Dalzell, in pretended embarrassment.  For a moment it looked as though Dan had turned the tables of mischief upon his tormentors.  His reply was so absurd that all of the upper class men, for a moment, betrayed signs of twitching at the corners of their mouths.  Then all of them conquered the desire to laugh and returned to the inquest with added severity. The late questioner turned to one of his classmates, remarking scornfully:  \"_Touge!_\"  \"Very touge, indeed\" replied the one addressed.  A \"touge\" plebe, in Naval Academy parlance, is one who is wholly \"fresh.\"  \"Mister,\" continued Dan's quizzer, \"we find you too full of levity for one who intends to embrace the profession of quarter-deck lounger.  In our belief it will be necessary for you to let some new ideas soak into your head.  Mister, get your wash basin and fill it exactly half full of water.  Remember, mister--neither a drop nor less than exactly half full.\"  Dan's first impulse was to grin, his second to laugh.  Yet something in the tone and look of the last speaker made \"touge\" Dalzell feel that the simplest way out of difficulty would be for him to obey as carefully and speedily as he could.  So, with a hurried \"very good, sir,\" Dalzell turned in quest of his basin.  He brought it, just about half full, for the inspection of his imperious visitor.  \"Place it there on the floor, beside the wall,\" ordered the tormentor  Dan obeyed.  \"Now, mister, stand on your head in that water!\"  Dan flushed hotly, for an instant.  He even clenched his fists. Then, with a sudden rush of good sense to the head, he bent over to carry out the order that he had received.  It was not as easy a feat as might be supposed, even for a rather well trained and hardened athlete like Dan Dalzell.  He got his head into the bowl all right, and rested his hands on the floor on either side of the bowl.  It was when he tried to throw his feet up against the wall that he came to grief. His feet slid along the wall and came down to the floor again.  Dan fell out of the bowl with a good deal of splash.  \"If, at first, you don't succeed, mister,\" began Midshipman Trotter, who had constituted himself chief of the tormentors, \"try, try some more.\"  \"I'll make it, sir,\" responded Dan cheerily, and his very manner, now, inclined his tormentors to go a little more lightly with him.  At the third trial, with his eyes closed, just below the level of the water, Dalzell succeeded in standing very solidly on his head.  The upper class men, who were all third class men, or \"youngsters\" as they are unofficially termed, watched the performance with interest.  \"Rather well done, for a beginner,\" commented Midshipman Trotter. \"As you were, mister.\"  Dan, unfortunately, tried to be a bit \"smart.\"  He made a half somersault forward, trying to spring up on his feet.  He fell back, however, and sat down squarely in what was left of the water.  \"Never mind a little wet, mister,\" advised Midshipman Trotter, with a very serious face.  \"We always rate a man as highly awkward, however, if he breaks the washbowl.\"  \"Which one of you is the better athlete?\" suddenly asked Midshipman Harris.  Neither chum intended to be caught, by this crowd, as wanting in modesty.  \"He is, sir,\" replied Dan, with great promptness, nodding toward Darrin.  \"Dalzell is, sir,\" contended Dave.  \"In view of this conflicting testimony, we shall have to settle the question by actual test,\" replied Mr. Trotter.  \"Mister,\" to Dan, \"bale out your boat.\"  From the nod which accompanied this command Dalzell understood that he was to empty the water from his wash basin so he promptly obeyed.  \"Mister,\" to Darrin, \"launch your boat on this water here.\"  Plainly the \"water\" signified the floor.  Dave brought out his own wash basin with alacrity.  Under further orders the chums placed their bowls about four feet apart.  \"Here,\" announced Midshipman Trotter, taking two toothpicks from a pocket, \"are a pair of oars.\"  Dave Darrin received the toothpicks with a grin.  \"And here are your oars, mister,\" supplemented Mr. Trotter, handing another pair of toothpicks to Dan Dalzell.  At this instant a faint knock was heard at the door, which opened immediately after.  \"Got a pair of beasts at work, fellows?\" asked a voice.  \"Here are some more young admirals who need a little help.\"  Four new midshipmen, in the custody of three youngsters, now stepped into the room and the door was closed.  \"Bender's in charge of the floor tonight, you know,\" nodded one of the newly-arrived youngsters, \"and Bender's duty-crazy.  Besides, he belongs to the second class, and hardly admits that we're alive.\"  On each floor a midshipman is detailed to be in charge through the evening.  He is responsible for discipline on his floor, and must report all breaches of the rules.  A midshipman who wishes to stand well with his comrades may, when in charge of the floor, conveniently fail to see a good many minor breaches of discipline. When the man in charge of the floor reports all breaches that come to his notice he is said to be duty-crazy.  He is also charged with \"trying to make his mark in grease.\"  \"Grease\" is high standing on the efficiency report.  As a rule the man who stands well in \"grease\" stands somewhat lower in general popularity.  Midshipman Bender, second class, was, at this time, regarded as one of the worst \"greasers\" of all.  \"What's on?\" inquired Midshipman Hayes, one of the newcomers in the room.  \"Tub race?\"  \"No, sir; fast spurt in single-pair shells,\" replied Midshipman Trotter impressively.  \"Whew!  You've caught some real athletes, have you?\"  \"That's what we want to find out,\" responded Mr. Trotter.  \"Now, then, misters, we warn you against approaching this noble sport in any spirit of levity!  You are not to think that this work is for your own amusement, or for anyone else's.  You must try yourselves out fairly and squarely.  Our purpose is to find out which is the better oarsman, and also which rows with the more finish.  Take your seats in your craft.\"  Dave and Dan seated themselves, with all possible gravity, in their respective wash basins.  \"Up oars!\" commanded Mr. Trotter.  As neither plebe knew just what was meant by this command they had to be shown how to sit holding their \"oars\" straight up in the air.  \"Let fall!\"  This time the two new men guessed fairly well.  They went through the motions of allowing their toothpick oars to fall into row-locks.  \"Now, at the outset, take your strokes from my count,\" directed Mr. Trotter.  \"One, two three, four, five, six, seven--\"  And so on.  It was all ludicrously absurd, to see Dave and Dan bending to their tasks as seriously as though they were rowing real craft with actual oars.  One of the visiting plebes was stupid enough to giggle.  \"Go over and stand by the window in arrest, mister,\" ordered Midshipman Hayes.  \"You shall be tried later!\"  Then the \"boat race\" continued.  It soon proved to be more than absurd; it was decidedly fatiguing.  Both Dave and Dan found that their strained positions, and the motions required of them, made backs and shoulders ache.  Their legs, too, began to suffer from cramp.  It was not until both showed signs of decided weariness that the race was brought to an end.  Then the cadet who had giggled was called forward, ordered to half fill one of the washbowls and to stand on his head in it.  While this was going on there was not a smile from anyone.  From the serious faces of all this might have been one of the most important bits of drill in the whole course at the Academy.  Dave, however, made the best impression upon the youngsters. All the other new men came sooner or later, to the ordeal of standing on their heads in the wet bowl, but Dave seemed destined to escape.  The rowing was carried on until all of the youngsters had tired of this sport.  \"Fall in, in platoon front,\" directed Midshipman Trotter.  The six plebes, solemn as owls, stood up in line, \"dressing\" their line carefully.  \"Now, attend me carefully,\" cautioned Mr. Trotter, sweeping a stern glance down the line of plebes.  \"I am about to tell you a bit of the day's news from over in Sleepy Hollow, which place is known to Maryland geographers as the village of Annapolis. You must attend me with extreme care, for, after I have narrated the news, I shall question you concerning it.  Do you follow me, misters?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came in a chorus.  \"You need not answer quite as loudly,\" warned Midshipman Trotter, sending a backward look over his shoulder at the door.  \"Now, then, the police over in Sleepy Hol--Annapolis--today learned the details of a yellow tragedy.  Some weeks ago three Chinamen came to town and opened a clean--I mean, a new--laundry.  During the last week, however, the public noted that the door leading from the office to the rear room was always closed.  You follow me?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came in an almost whispered chorus.  \"Finally,\" continued Mr. Trotter, \"one customer, more curious than the others, reported his observations to the police.  Today the Johnny Tinplates made a raid on the place.  A most curious state of affairs came to light.  So--but is this tangled tale clear to you all as far as I have gone?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came the whispered chorus.  \"What the police learned,\" went on Mr. Trotter, in a voice that now sounded slightly awestruck, \"was this: a week ago the three Chinese partners had a serious row.  They quarreled, then fought. Two of "]]]
