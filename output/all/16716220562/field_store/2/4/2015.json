Dave and Dan were in their room, poring hard over French, when a light tap sounded on the door.  Right on top of the tap Midshipman Farley, fourth class, entered on tiptoe, closing the door behind him.  This accomplished, Farley dropped his air of stealth, strolling over to the study desk.  \"There's a nice little place in town--you know, Purdy's,\" began Farley significantly.  \"I've heard of it as an eating place,\" responded Darrin.  \"It's more than that,\" returned Farley, smacking his lips.  \"It's an ideal place for a banquet.\"  \"I accept your word for it,\" smiled Dave.  \"I don't ask you to, Darrin,\" grinned Farley.  \"Like any honest man I'm prepared to prove all I say.  Purdy has received--by underground telegraph--orders to prepare a swell feast for eight. It's to be ready at eleven tonight.  We had the eight all made up, but two fellows have flunked cold.  We're to French it over the wall tonight, leaving here a few minutes after taps.  Are you on?\"  Farley's enthusiastic look fell upon the face of Dalzell.  \"I'm on!\" nodded Dan  \"No; you're not\" broke in Dave quietly.  \"I'm afraid I must disagree with you, little David,\" murmured Dan.  \"Oysters, clams, fish--watermelon!\" tempted Midshipman Farley.  \"Um-yum!\" grunted Dan, his eyes rolling.  \"Then you're with us, Dalzell?\" insisted Farley.  \"Well, rather--\"  \"--not!\" interjected Dave Darrin with emphasis.  \"Now, what are you butting in for, you greasy greaser?\" demanded Farley, giving Dave a contemptuous glance.  \"Maybe you won't join us, and maybe we'd just as soon not have as greasy a midshipman as you at the festive board, but Dalzell isn't tied to your apron strings, are you, Dalzell?\"  \"No; he's not,\" replied Darrin, speaking for his chum.  \"Dalzell will speak for himself, if he insists.  But he and I have been chums these many years, and we've often given each other good advice in trying or tempting times.  Dalzell will go with you, if he cares to, for he already knows all that I have to say on the subject.\"  \"You've had your nose stuck down deep in the grease-pot ever since you struck Annapolis!\" cried Farley angrily.  \"I hope you bilge, Darrin; with all my heart I hope you bilge soon.  We don't need a mollycoddle like you here in the Naval Academy!\"  \"Isn't that about all you want to say?\" demanded Dave, looking up with a frown.  \"No; it's not half what I have to say,\" cried Farley hotly.  \"Darrin, your kind of fellow is a disgrace to the Naval service!  You're a sneak--that's what--\"  \"You may stop, right there!\" frowned Darrin, rising from his chair.  \"I'll stop when I'm proper ready!\" retorted Farley hotly.  \"If you don't stop right now, you'll finish while engaged in landing on your ear in the hall outside!\" warned Dave, stepping forward.  There was a new look in Darrin's usually patient eyes.  It was a look Farley hadn't seen there before, and it warned the hot-headed midshipman that he was in danger of going too far.  \"Oh, fudge on you, Darrin!\" jeered Farley, turning on his heel. \"Going to be with us, Dalzell?  \"No,\" replied Dan promptly.  \"I never travel with the enemies of my friends.\"  \"Greasers, both of you!\" flung back the caller, and left them.  \"If that fellow had talked an hour longer I believe I might have lost my patience,\" smiled Darrin, as he turned back to his desk. \"But I'm glad you're not with that outfit tonight Danny boy. It may turn out a big scrape.\"  \"Why should it turn out a big scrape.\" demanded Dan.  \"Oh, you never can tell,\" replied Darrin, as he picked up his book.  Farley did not succeed in getting two more midshipmen to join in the Frenching.  Twenty minutes after taps, however, the original six of the fourth class slipped out of Bancroft Hall.  Slyly they made their way to where they had a board hidden near the wall of the Academy grounds.  One at a time, and swiftly, they went up this board, and over the wall.  At Purdy's they found a meal to tempt the most whimsical appetite. The meal over they spent much time in singing and story-telling.  It was nearly two in the morning when Farley and his fellow feasters tried to get back into the grounds, over the wall.  They got over the wall, all right, but only to fall into the hands of one of the watchmen, who seemed to have known exactly where to expect their return.  All six were reported to the officer in charge.  At breakfast formation Midshipmen Farley, Oates, Scully, Brimmer, Henkel and Page were assigned fifty demerits each for unauthorized absence during the night.  Farley and his friends were furious.  More, they were talkative.  Had Dave Darrin been less occupied that day he would have noted that many of his classmates avoided him.  Dan did notice, and wondered, without speaking of the matter.  That day all the upper class men returned, and Bancroft Hall hummed for a while with the bustle of the returning hundreds.  Just before the dinner formation Youngster Trotter encountered Dave in the corridor.  \"Hullo, mister!\" was Trotter's greeting, and the youngster actually held out his hand.  \"I hope you had a mighty pleasant leave, sir,\" replied Dave, returning the handclasp.  \"Passably pleasant, passably, mister,\" returned Midshipman Trotter. \"But see here, mister, what's this about you and your class that I've heard?  \"Nothing, so far as I know, sir,\" replied Dave, scanning the youngster's face closely.  \"It must be more than nothing,\" returned Trotter.  \"I understand that more than half of your class are furious with you over something that happened last night.  I've heard you called a sneak, mister, though I don't believe that for a single minute.  But I've heard mutterings to the effect that your class will send you to coventry for excessive zeal in greasing, to the detriment of your classmates. What about it all, mister?\"  Dave Darrin gazed at the youngster with eyes full of wonder.  \"What about it?\" repeated Dave.  \"That's the very thing I'd like to know, sir, for this is the very first word I've heard of it.\"  Nor could Midshipman Trotter doubt that Dave Darrin had answered in all sincerity.  \"Well, you certainly must be innocent, mister, if you're as puzzled as all this,\" replied the youngster.  \"Then it must be that malicious mischief is brewing against you in some quarter.  Take my advice, mister, and find out what it all means.\"  \"Thank you.  I most certainly will, sir,\" replied Dave, his eyes flashing.     CHAPTER VI  DAVE PASSES THE LIE   Dalzell looked up wonderingly as Darrin marched swiftly into their room.  \"Danny boy, have you heard any talk against me today?\" demanded Dave.  \"Do I look as though I had been fighting?\" queried Dan promptly.  \"I've just heard, from Trotter, that a good many of the fellows in our class are scorching me, and talking of sending me to coventry. Will you--\"  \"I sure will,\" broke in Dan, dropping his book, rising and snatching at his cap.  \"I'll be back as soon as I've heard something, or have settled with the fellow who says it.\"  Dan was out of the room like a flash.  Dave sat down heavily in his chair, his brow wrinkling as he tried to imagine what it all meant.  \"It must all be a mistake that Trotter has made,\" argued Dave with himself.  \"Of course, Trotter might be stringing me, but I don't believe he would do that.  Now, to be sure, I came near to having words with Farley last night, but that wouldn't be the basis for any action by the fourth class.  That, if anything, would be wholly a personal matter.  Then what am I accused of doing?  It must be some fierce sort of lie when the fellows talk of taking it up as a class matter.\"  For ten minutes more Dave puzzled and pondered over the problem. Then the door flew open and Dan bolted hastily in.  \"You haven't been hitting anyone have you?  asked Dave, noticing the flushed, angry face of his chum.  \"No!  But one of us will have to do some hitting soon,\" burst hotly from Dalzell.  \"It'll be my hit, then, I guess,\" smiled Dave wearily.  \"Have you found out--\"  \"Dave it's the most absurd sort of lie!  You know that Farley and his little crowd got caught last night, when they returned from their Frenching party over the wall?\"  \"Frenching\" is taking unauthorized leave from the academic limits by going over the wall, instead of through the gate.  \"Yes; I know Farley and his friends got caught,\" rejoined Darrin. \"But what has that to do with me?  \"Farley and his friends are sore--\"  \"They ought not to be,\" said Darrin quietly.  \"They took the chance, and now they ought to be ready to pay up like good sportsmen.\"  \"Dave, _they say you informed on them, and got them caught!_\"  \"What?\" shouted Darrin, leaping to his feet.  His face was deathly white and the corners of his mouth twitched.  He took two bounding steps toward the door, but Dalzell threw himself in his chum's way.  \"Not just this minute, Dave!\" ordered Dan firmly.  \"We don't want any manslaughter here--not even of the 'justifiable' kind! Sit and wait until you've cooled off--some.  When you go out I'm going with you--whether it's out into the corridor, or out of the Naval Academy for good.  Sit down, now!  Try to talk it over coolly, and get yourself into a frame of mind where you can talk with others without prejudicing your case.\"  \"My case?\" repeated Dave bitterly, as he allowed Dan to force him back into his chair.  \"I haven't any case.  I haven't done anything.\"  \"I know that, but you've got to get cool, and stay so, if you want to make sure that others have a chance to know it,\" warned Dan.  \"Does Farley say that I sneaked in information against him?\"  \"Farley and the others are so sore over their demerits that they believe almost anything, now, and they say almost anything.  Of course, Farley remembers the row he had with you last night. In a fool way he puts two and two together, an decides that you helped set the trap for them.\"  \"If I had done a dirty thing like that, then I'd deserve to be cut by the whole"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],["title","Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#8)"],["body","igade,\" retorted Dave, his face flushing.  \"But I want to tell you, right now, Dave, that some of the fellows of our class know you too well to believe any such thing against you.\"  \"I'm properly grateful to the few, then,\" retorted Darrin, his eyes softening a trifle.  \"But come along, Dan, if you will.  I mean to start in at once to sift this thing down.\"  \"Let me look at you,\" ordered Dalzell, grappling with his chum, and looking him over.  Then, a moment later, Dan added:  \"Yes; you're cool enough, I think.  I'll go with you.  But remember that the easiest way to destroy yourself is to let your temper get on top.  If anybody is to get mad before the crowd, let me do it.  Then you can restrain me if I get too violent.\"  Dave Darrin took his uniform cap down from the nail and put it on with great deliberation.  Next, he picked up his whisk broom, flecking off two or three imaginary specks of dust.  \"Now, I guess we can go along, Danny boy,\" he remarked, in a tone of ominous quietness.  \"Where are you headed?\" murmured Dalzell, as they reached the room door.  \"To Farley's room,\" answered Dave Darrin coolly.  \"Do you suppose he's there?\"  \"He was, a few moments ago\" Dan answered.  \"Then let us hope he is now.\"  Carrying himself with his most erect and military air, Darrin stepped down the corridor, Dalzell keeping exactly at his side.  The chums arrived before the door of the room in which Farley was lodged.  Dave raised his hand, sounding a light knock on the door, which he next pushed open.  Farley and a dozen other members of the fourth class were in the room.  Moreover, it was evident instantly that some of those present were discussing the burning class issue.  \"But are you sure he did it?  Farley?\" one midshipman inquired, as the chums entered.  \"Sure?\" repeated Farley.  \"Of course I am!  Didn't I tell you what a hot row we had.  Darrin--\"  \"I'm here to speak for myself, Farley,\" boomed in the quiet, steady voice of Dave Darrin.  \"But I'll hear you first, if you wish.\"  \"Oh, you're here, are you?\" cried Farley hotly, wheeling about on the visitors.  Some of the other fourth class men present turned and glanced coldly at the two last-comers.  Others looked on with eager curiosity.  \"I've heard,\" announced Darrin, \"that you are saying some things about me that don't sound well.  So I've come to ask you what you are saying.\"  \"I won't keep you waiting,\" jeered Farley.  \"You know, from hearing morning orders, that six of us were given fifty demerits apiece.\"  \"For going over the wall to a late supper in town,\" nodded Dave.  \"You wouldn't go with us,\" continued Farley angrily, \"and gave us a greaser's talk-fest instead.\"  \"I didn't advise you against going,\" responded Dave, standing with his arms folded, utterly cool as he eyed his accuser.  \"Then, after we went, some one went and wised the powers,\" charged Farley.  \"Now, no one but a most abandoned greaser would do that.\"  To \"wise the powers\" is to give information to the Naval officers.  \"The fellow who would wilfully tell on you would be worse than what you term a greaser,\" agreed Dave.  \"Careful,\" warned Farley ironically.  \"You know who told, or who caused the wise word to leak to the powers.\"  \"I don't,\" Dave denied bluntly.  \"You're the sneak, yourself!\" cried Farley angrily.  \"I am not,\" spoke Dave, with clear denial.  \"Do you mean to say I lie?\" demanded Midshipman Farley threateningly, as he took a step forward.  \"Do you deliberately state that I informed upon you, or caused you to be informed upon?\" demanded Dave Darrin.  \"Yes, I do!  \"Then you lie!\" returned Darrin promptly.  With a suppressed yell Farley sprang at Darrin, and the latter struck out quickly.     CHAPTER VII  ON THE FIELD OF THE CODE   Midshipman Farley had the bad judgment to stop that blow with the side of his neck.  Across the room he spun, going down in a heap, his head under the study table.  Dave Darrin looked on with a cool smile, while Farley lay there for an instant, then scrambled out and up onto his feet.  But two or three other new midshipmen sprang in between Dave and his accuser.  \"We can't have a fight here, Farley,\" urged two or three in the same breath.  \"Let me at the sneak!\" sputtered Farley who was boiling over with rage.  \"Yes; let him at me,\" voiced Dave coolly, \"and I'll send him into the middle of next term!\"  But three of the midshipmen clung to Farley, who furiously strove to fling them off.  \"Let me at him!\" insisted the accuser.  \"He struck me.\"  \"You struck at him first, and didn't land,\" replied one of the peacemakers.  \"You go on with a fight here, and you'll bring the officer in charge down on us all.  Farley, if you feel you've a grievance you are privileged to take recourse to the regular code in such matters.\"  \"The fellow has lied about me, and I'm ready to settle it with him now, or outside by appointment,\" broke in Dave, speaking as coolly as before.  \"He calls me 'fellow' and 'liar,'\" panted Farley, turning white. \"Do you think I can stand that?  \"You don't have to,\" replied one of those who held Farley back. \"Send Darrin a challenge, in the regular way.\"  \"I will!\" panted Midshipman Farley.  \"And I'll hammer him all over and out of the meeting-place!\"  \"Then it's settled for a challenge,\" interposed Dan Dalzell. \"That will suit us all right.  We'll be ready whenever the challenge comes.  And now, to prevent getting a lot of decent fellows into a needless scrape, Darrin and I will withdraw.\"  Dan took Dave by the arm, and both turned to leave the room.  \"You--\" began Farley hoarsely, when another midshipman clapped a hand over his mouth.  \"Shut up Farley!  Save all of your undoubted grit for the field, when you two meet.\"  The door closed softly behind Darrin and Dalzell.  \"Why didn't you let me at the sneak?\" bellowed Farley, released, now, from interfering hands.  \"See here, Farley,\" advised one of his friends, \"cool down and keep your face in a restful attitude.  Darrin behaved twice as well as you did.  If you don't look out you'll lose the sympathy of the class.  Just keep cool, and restrain your tongue from wagging until you've met Darrin.  Don't try to start the row again, this side of the field where you meet.  If you do, you'll get many a cold shoulder.\"  Other midshipmen present spoke in the same vein.  Farley, who wanted to be popular at all times, presently allowed himself to be advised.  Of course the news of the meeting, and of the more emphatic one to come spread fast through Bancroft Hall.  There is an unknown wireless that carries all such news on wings through the brigade of midshipmen.  Within half an hour Henkel and Page brought the challenge to Dave Darrin.  Dan, in the meantime, had been busy, and had induced Midshipman Rollins, of the fourth class, to act with him as second. Rollins, indeed, needed little urging.  He was eager to see the fight.  Tyson, of the second class, was secured as referee, while Trotter, of the third class, gladly agreed to act as time-keeper.  The time was set for an hour before taps, as, on this evening, it would be easy for all the young men involved to slip away and be back in time for taps.  \"I won't let the thing run over two rounds,\" promised Farley, who had an excellent idea of himself as a fighter.  That afternoon Dave and Farley were obliged to pass each other. Dave did not even seem to know that his enemy was around.  Farley, on the other hand, glared ferociously at Darrin as he passed.  Midshipman Trotter certainly would have come around to offer Dave friendly counsel, had not his position as one of the officials of the fight restrained him.  Dave, by his prompt action, had veered many of his classmates around to his side.  The bulk of opinion in the class, however, was that Farley would make good in his boasts of victory.  He was a heavily-built yet very active young man, who had shown great promise in boxing bouts in the gymnasium.  At half-past eight that evening, while scores of cadets strolled through the grounds, thinking of the academic term to begin on the morrow, some little groups made their way more directly across the grounds.  Many interested glances followed them.  Over in the direction of the Old Government Hospital stepped Dave, accompanied by Dan and Rollins.  They were the first to arrive, though a few minutes later Midshipmen Tyson and Trotter appeared.  \"Farley doesn't seem in as a big hurry as he was,\" remarked Dan Dalzell laughingly.  It was not, in fact, until close to the time that Farley, Henkel and Page came on the scene.  \"We want to put this mill through briskly, gentlemen,\" announced Midshipman Tyson, in a low tone.  \"Both principals will be good enough to get ready as rapidly as possible.\"  Dave Darrin had been only awaiting the order.  Now he took off his cap and uniform blouse, handing them to Dan, who folded the coat and laid it on the ground, placing the cap on top of it.  By this time Darrin had pulled his shirt over his head.  Dan took that also, while Rollins produced a belt which Dave strapped about his waist with care.  Then he stepped forward, like a young war horse, sniffing the battle.  Farley was more leisurely in his preparations, though he did not appear nervous.  In fact, Farley wasn't a bit nervous.  But he meant \"wind up\" the fight in such short order that there would be an abundance of time to spare.  \"There's no use in giving you any advice, old fellow,\" murmured Dan.  \"You've been in too many fights, back in the good old High School days of Dick & Co.\"  \"I can handle myself,\" nodded Dave, \"unless Farley proves to be a veritable wonder.\"  \"He certainly thinks he is,\" warned Rollins.  \"And a good many of the fellows believe Farley to be the best man of the class in this line of work.\"  \"They won't think so much longer,\" returned Dan, as simply as though merely stating a proved fact.  \"You see, Rollins, you never had the great good luck to get your kid training with Dick & Co. Our old crowd always went in to win just because we were"]]]
