Blinks resolved to act upon this suggestion; and, the following evening, he posted a sentry over lite galley, with instructions to arrest any one who might be discovered prowling around. After fastening the doors and windows himself, he put the keys in his pocket and walked away.  At half-past nine o'clock our young sailors and Simpson were again on hand. After a careful reconnoissance, the sentry was discovered fast asleep at his post. They immediately set to work as before--the galley was raised up, and three more pies secured. It was all done in a moment, and the sentinel was not awakened; and as they retreated to their hammocks, they could scarcely refrain from laughing outright, when they thought how nicely the trick was performed.  The next morning Blinks opened the galley at an early hour, and was surprised and enraged to find that some of his pies were again missing. He carefully examined every nook and corner of the galley, but failed to discover a place where any one could effect an entrance.  For four nights more, in succession, Frank and his accomplices visited the galley, each time taking pies enough to last them a whole day; and Blinks, in the mean time, was making unavailing efforts to discover the offenders. On the fifth night, Archie, who was the one that always went into the galley, was much longer than usual in finding the pies. At length he whispered,  \"I say, Simpson!\"  \"Ay, ay, my hearty; what is it?\"  \"I can't find but one pie.\"  \"You can't, hey?\" said Simpson; \"I smell a rat. Bring the pie out here.\"  Archie accordingly handed it out, saying, as he did so--  \"I'm hungry as blazes; I believe I'll eat a piece of that pie to-night.\"  \"Not in a hurry,\" said Simpson, as they began to crawl back toward their hammocks; \"not in a hurry; I've been in such scrapes as this before, and can't be fooled easy.\"  \"What do you mean?\" inquired Frank.  \"Why, I mean that this pie was made on purpose for us,\" said Simpson; \"it has got some kind of medicine in it that will make a fellow sick. If we should eat it, they would not be long in finding out who stole the pies.\"  \"I'll tell you what to do with it,\" said Frank, suddenly; \"let's give it to Jenkins, the boatswain's mate; he's a mean fellow, and I shouldn't be sorry to see him sick.'  \"That's just what I was going to do with it,\" said Simpson. \"Now, you go back to your hammocks, and I'll carry him the pie.\"  \"As Simpson had taken particular notice of the place where Jenkins was in the habit of slinging his hammock, he had no difficulty whatever in finding it.  \"I say, shipmate,\" he whispered, shaking the mate by the shoulder.  \"What do you want?\" he growled.  \"Wake up,\" said Simpson; \"I've got a nice pie for you; do you want it?\"  \"Of course I do,\" answered the mate, taking it from Simpson's hand. \"But who are you?\" he inquired, for it was so dark that he could not have recognized the features of his most intimate friend.  \"I'm Jack Smith,\" answered Simpson; \"but I can't stop to talk with you, for some one may discover me;\" and before Jenkins could detain him, he had slipped off quietly in the darkness.  It was as Simpson had said--the pie had made \"on purpose for them.\" When Blinks saw that it was impossible to discover the guilty party, he ordered his steward to make a nice large pie, into which he put two doses of jalap. It was his intention to make the offender sick; and he told the doctor what he had done, and requested him to keep an eye on all who came to him for medicine.  The next morning Jenkins was not heard blowing his whistle, but was seen moving slowly about the ship, with a pale, woe-begone countenance; and as soon as the doctor appeared, he made application to go on the \"sick-list.\"  \"What's the matter with you?\" inquired the doctor.  Jenkins then explained how he had been suddenly taken very ill during the night, and was afraid he was going to die. The doctor, who knew in a moment that it was the effect of the medicine contained in the pie, exclaimed:  \"Why, you're just the man Mr. Blinks has been wanting to see for the last week. Orderly, ask Mr. Blinks if he will have the kindness to come here a moment.\"  The orderly disappeared, and Jenkins stood, looking the very picture of despair, too sick to know or care what was going on.  \"Mr. Blinks, I've found your man,\" said the doctor, when the paymaster's steward made his appearance.  \"Well, my fine fellow,\" said Blinks, turning to the mate, and smiling grimly, \"how do you feel by this time? Very pleasant morning, isn't it! I knew I'd catch you, you scoundrel,\" he exclaimed, suddenly changing his tune; \"I'll teach you to steal my pies!\"  \"I--I--don't know what you mean, sir!\" said the mate, in surprise.  \"Don't talk to me, you villain,\" said Blinks savagely; \"didn't you eat a pie last night?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jenkins, hesitatingly, \"but\"--  \"I knew you did, you rascal.\"  \"But the pie was given to me, sir,\" said the mate.  \"Oh, that story won't do at all. I'll fix you. Go below.\"  In a short, time the mate, who was so weak that he was scarcely able to stand alone, was summoned before the captain, who gave him a severe reprimand, and disrated him. He came down on deck, looking very forlorn indeed; and as he passed by Simpson, who, with Frank and Archie, was standing in the starboard gangway, the former exclaimed:  \"That's what I call squaring the yards; I'm even with him now.\"  As soon as Jenkins had recovered from the effects of the physic, he began to make efforts to find Jack Smith. One day he approached Simpson who was seated on a coil of rope, spinning one of his forecastle yarns to Frank and Archie, and said:  \"Shipmate, do you know any one aboard here named Jack Smith?\"  \"No,\" answered Simpson, with the utmost gravity, \"I don't know any one who goes by that name.\"  \"Well, there _is_ a chap here by that name,\" said Jenkins, \"and I wish I could find him. He got me into a bad scrape.\"  But, it is needless to say, he never found Jack Smith.     CHAPTER IV.  A Midnight Alarm.   On the afternoon of the following day, as Frank and his cousin were walking up and down the deck, talking over old times, Simpson hurriedly approached them, exclaiming,  \"Boys, do you want to leave this ship?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Frank; \"we're tired of staying here.\"  \"Well, it's all right, then. I volunteered to go, and I had both your names put down. The executive officer says if you want to go, just get your donnage and go for'ard.\"  \"Where are we to go?\" inquired Archie.  \"On board of the Illinois,\" answered Simpson. \"She is a magazine-ship, and is lying half-way between here and Mound City. No work at all to do, I'm going.'  \"Then we'll go, of course,\" said Frank; \"for we don't want to lose you.\"  They immediately got down their hammocks and bags, and went forward, where they found the executive officer standing on the forecastle, waiting for them.  \"Well, lads, do you volunteer to go on the Illinois?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Jump down into that dingy, then,\" said the officer, pointing to a small boat that lay alongside.  The boys did as they were ordered, and just as they had finished storing away their bags and hammocks under the thwarts, a man dressed in the uniform of a sailor sprang down into the boat, exclaiming:  \"Man your oars, lads, and shove off--you've a long pull before you.\"  Archie took one of the oars, Frank the other; Simpson stowed himself away in the bow of the boat, and the sailor took his seat at the helm.  The cousins were both good oarsmen, and they made the little boat dance over the water like a duck. It was full five miles to the place where the Illinois lay, and they soon found that it was indeed \"a long, hard pull.\" The current was very strong, and it reminded the boys of many a tough struggle they had had around the head of Strawberry Island, in the Kennebec River.  In about two hours they reached the Illinois, and, as they sprang on board, their baggage was seized by willing hands, and carried to the cabin, which had been stripped of nearly all its furniture, and presented, altogether, a desolate appearance. After a few moments' conversation with one of their new messmates, they learned that there were only fifteen men on board the vessel, including one sergeant and two corporals. These were the only officers; and they were, in fact, no officers at all, for they were all rated, on the books of the receiving-ship, as \"landsmen.\"  They soon discovered that there was no discipline among the crew--there could not be under the circumstances. Each stood a two-hour watch, at night, and assisted in pumping out the ship, morning and evening. With the exception of these duties, there was no work to be done on board the vessel. The remainder of the day was spent as suited them best. Some passed the time in hunting and nailing, some in reading, and some lounged about the decks, from morning until night.  Frank and Archie were very much pleased with their new situation. There was no boatswain's mate to trouble them, and they were in no danger of rendering themselves liable to punishment for some unintentional offense.  After stowing away their bags and hammocks, they amused themselves in strolling about the boat, until a neat-looking little sailor stepped up, and informed them that supper was ready. They followed him into the cabin, and took their seats at the table, with the rest, and one of the sailors, who went by the name of Woods, exclaimed:  \"Now, boys, pitch in, help yourselves, for if you don't, you won't be helped at all. Every one that comes here has to learn to take care of himself.\"  \"You will not find us at all bashful,\" answered Frank, and he began helping himself most bountifully to every thing on the table.  It did not take them long to become acquainted, and the boys found that their new shipmates were much better educated than the majority of the sailors they had met. They"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#4)"],["body","a good-natured, jovial set of fellows, and the meal-hour passed away quickly and pleasantly.  Immediately after supper the corporal ordered all hands below to pump out the ship. In a quarter of an hour this was accomplished, and as they were ascending to the boiler-deck. Woods remarked:  \"I wish I was back in Wisconsin again for a little while.\"  \"Are you tired of the navy?\" inquired Frank.  \"Oh, no!\" answered Woods; \"but I should like to see my friends again, and try my hand at quail-shooting.\"  \"Are you fond of hunting?\"  \"Yes, indeed; I spend all my spare time in the woods, when I am at home.\"  This was the very man, of all others, that Frank would have chosen for a companion, and he informed Woods that he also was very fond of rural sports. They seated themselves on the boiler door railing, and each related some of his hunting and fishing adventures, and, finally, Woods proposed that they should go over the river into Kentucky, on the following morning, on a squirrel hunt. Frank, of course, readily agreed to this. He immediately started in search of his cousin and Simpson, and informed them of the proposed excursion. When he returned to the place where he had left Woods, he found him with a musket on his shoulder, and a cartridge-box buckled about his waist, pacing up and down the deck.  \"I'm on watch, you see,\" he said, as Frank came up, \"You will go on at midnight; so you had better go and turn in. If we go hunting to-morrow, we must start by four o'clock at least, for we have a good way to walk before we reach the hunting-ground. Good night.\" And Woods, settling his musket more firmly on his shoulder, continued his beat, while Frank sought his hammock.  About midnight he was awakened by a hand laid on his shoulder, when, starting up, he found one of the corporals standing beside his hammock holding a lantern in his hand.  \"Is your name Nelson?\" he inquired.  Frank answered in the affirmative, and the corporal continued:  \"Roll out, then, for it is time for you to go on watch. But be careful when you come out, or you'll be shot.\"  \"Shot!\" exclaimed Frank. \"Who'll shoot me? Are there any rebels around here?\"  \"Yes, plenty of them. There are some out on the bank now. I was walking with Woods, when I happened to look up, and saw two men, with their muskets pointed straight at us; but we got out ofthe way before they had time to shoot. Hurry up, now, but don't expose yourself,\" and the corporal hurried aft, hiding his lantern under his coat of the went.  What Frank's feelings were, we will not attempt to say. He was not a coward, for we once saw him alone in the forest, standing face to face with a wounded wild-cat, with no weapon in his hands but an ax; but fighting a wild-cat and a rebel sharp-shooter were two widely different things. He had never heard the whistle of a hostile bullet, nor had he ever seen a rebel; and it is not to be wondered at, if his feelings were not of the most enviable nature. But he was not one to shrink from his duty because it was dangerous; and he drew on his clothes as quickly as possible, and seizing a musket and cartridge-box that stood in a rack close by the cabin door, he hurried aft, where he found Woods concealed behind the port wheel-house, and the corporal behind a chicken-coop. They both held their guns in readiness, and were peering into the woods, as if trying to pierce the thick darkness that enshrouded them. The Illinois was tied up close to the bank, which, as the water in the river was low, was about thirty feet in hight; and as the moon was shining very brightly, a person hidden in the bushes could distinctly see every thing on deck.  \"Keep close there,\" said Woods, as Frank came up. \"The corporal says he saw some guerrillas on the bank.\"  Frank accordingly concealed himself behind a stanchion, and his hand trembled considerably as he cocked his musket and brought it to his shoulder. They remained in this position for nearly a quarter of an hour, when, suddenly, something stirred in the bushes.  \"There they are,\" whispered the corporal, drawing himself entirely out of sight, behind the chicken-coop. \"Look out, they'll shoot in a moment.\"  Frank kept a close watch on the bushes, and presently discovered a white object moving about among them.  \"I see something, boys,\" he said; \"but it don't look to me like a man.\"  \"Yes, it is a man,\" exclaimed the corporal, excitedly. \"Shoot him.\"  In obedience to the order, Frank raised his gun to his shoulder, and an ounce ball and a couple of buckshot went crashing through the bushes. The commotion increased for a moment, and then ceased, and something that sounded very much like a groan issued from the woods.  \"By gracious, you hit one of them,\" exclaimed the corporal. \"That was a good shot. We'll teach these rebs that it isn't healthy to go prowling about here at night.\"  Frank hastily reloaded his musket, and they waited, impatiently, for nearly an hour, for the other guerrilla to show himself, but the woods remained as silent as death.  \"I guess that shot finished them,\" said the corporal; \"so I will go and turn in. Keep a good look-out,\" he added, turning to Frank, \"and don't expose yourself too much.\"  Woods and the corporal then went into the cabin, and Frank was left to himself. A feeling of loneliness he had never before experienced came over him. At first he determined to go and call his cousin to come and stand watch with him, so that he would have some one to talk with; but, on second thought, he remembered that Archie was to come on watch at two o'clock, and probably would not like to be disturbed. Besides, if he called him, it would look as though he was a coward, and afraid to stand his watch alone; so he gave up the idea, and remained in his place of concealment. Once he thought he discovered the sheen of a musket among the bushes; but it was only his imagination, and after waiting half an hour without hearing any thing suspicious, he shouldered his gun, and commenced pacing the deck, in full view of the woods. But he was not molested, and when two o'clock came he saw a figure steal cautiously out of the cabin, and creep along toward him, under cover of the wheel-house. As he approached nearer, Frank recognized his cousin.  \"Where are the rebs?\" inquired the latter.  \"The corporal said he saw two of them out there in the woods,\" answered Frank, pointing to a thick clump of bushes that stood on the edge of the bank; \"and there was _something_ out there, and I shot at it. But I've been on deck here, in plain sight, for the last hour, and haven't seen any thing.\"  \"I hope there are no rebs in there,\" said Archie; \"but I'll keep dark for awhile. I shipped to fight, but I don't like the idea of having a fellow send a bullet into me when I can't see him,\" and he began to settle himself into a comfortable position behind the chicken-coop.  \"I don't think there is any danger,\" said Frank; \"but perhaps it is well to be careful at first. Be sure and call us when you come off watch,\" and he shouldered his rifle and walked leisurely into the cabin.     CHAPTER V.  A Discomfited Rebel.   Archie stood his watch without seeing or hearing any thing of the rebels, and when he was relieved, at four o'clock, he aroused Simpson, Woods, and his cousin, and after they had tied up their hammocks, and stowed them away in the nettings, Woods went to the sergeant's room to obtain his consent to their proposed excursion. This was easily accomplished, and while they were filling their pockets with musket-cartridges, Frank proposed that they should go out and see what it was that had occasioned the alarm during the night; so they leaned their muskets up in one corner of the cabin, and ran out on the bank, and there, weltering in his blood, lay, not a rebel, but a white mule. He it was that, while feeding about in the woods, had occasioned the disturbance in the bushes, and Frank's shot had done its work. The two men with muskets had existence only in the corporal's imagination. Simpson burst into a loud laugh.  \"A nice set of fellows you are,\" he exclaimed. \"I shouldn't want you stationed at my gun in action.\"  \"Why not?\" inquired Frank.  \"Why, because you can't tell the difference between a mule and a secesh.\"  Frank made no reply to this, for, although he was very much relieved to find that it was a mule, and not a man, that he had killed, he was a good deal mortified at first, for he expected to be made the laughing-stock of his companions. But he consoled himself with the thought that he was not to blame. The corporal had said that he had seen guerrillas in the woods, and he had, as in duty bound, done his best to drive them away; besides, he would not have fired his gun had he not been ordered to do so.  \"It's no matter,\" said Simpson, who noticed that Frank looked a little crest-fallen; \"It was the corporal's fault.\"  \"I know it,\" said Frank. \"But that's poor consolation. I killed the mule, and shall probably be laughed at for it.\"  \"What's the odds?\" asked Simpson. \"I've seen many a better man than you laughed at. But let us be going, for we have a long way to walk.\"  They accordingly retraced their steps to the vessel, and Woods awoke one of the corporals, who had volunteered to row them over into Kentucky. The dingy, which was kept fastened to the stern of the Illinois, was hauled alongside, and, in a few moments, they reached the opposite shore. Our four hunters sprang out, and, bidding the corporal good-by, shouldered their muskets, and disappeared in the forest. Woods, who was well acquainted with the \"lay of the land,\" led the way. Just at sunrise they reached a ridge covered with hickory and pecan-trees.  \"Here we are,\" he exclaimed, as he leaned on his gun, and wiped his forehead with his coat-sleeve. \"There are plenty of squirrels around here. But I'm hungry; we have plenty of time to eat some breakfast before we begin.\"  They seated themselves under the branches of some small hickories, and Simpson produced from a"]]]
