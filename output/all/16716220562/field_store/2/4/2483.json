Certain it is that no fact is better attested by the Conquerors themselves, who had ample means of information, and no motive for misstatement. - The Italian poets, in their gorgeous pictures of the gardens of Alcina and Morgana, came nearer the truth than they imagined. Our surprise, however, may reasonably be excited, when we consider that the wealth displayed by the Peruvian princes was only that which each had amassed individually for himself.  He owed nothing to inheritance from his predecessors.  On the decease of an Inca, his palaces were abandoned; all his treasures, except what were employed in his obsequies, his furniture and apparel, were suffered to remain as he left them, and his mansions, save one, were closed up for ever.  The new sovereign was to provide himself with every thing new for his royal state.  The reason of this was the popular belief, that the soul of the departed monarch would return after a time to reanimate his body on earth; and they wished that he should find every thing to which he had been used in life prepared for his reception. *45  [Footnote 45: Acosta, lib. 6, cap. 12. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 6, cap. 4.]  When an Inca died, or, to use his own language, \"was called home to the mansions of his father, the Sun,\" *46 his obsequies were celebrated with great pomp and solemnity.  The bowels were taken from the body, and deposited in the temple of Tampu, about five leagues from the capital.  A quantity of his plate and jewels was buried with them, and a number of his attendants and favorite concubines, amounting sometimes, it is said, to a thousand, were immolated on his tomb. *47 Some of them showed the natural repugnance to the sacrifice occasionally manifested by the victims of a similar superstition in India. But these were probably the menials and more humble attendants; since the women have been known, in more than one instance, to lay violent hands on themselves, when restrained from testifying their fidelity by this act of conjugal martyrdom.  This melancholy ceremony was followed by a general mourning throughout the empire.  At stated intervals, for a year, the people assembled to renew the expressions of their sorrow; processions were made, displaying the banner of the departed monarch; bards and minstrels were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their songs continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence of the reigning monarch, - thus stimulating the living by the glorious example of the dead. *48  [Footnote 46: The Aztecs, also, believed that the soul of the warrior who fell in battle went to accompany the Sun in his bright progress through the heavens.  (See Conquest of Mexico, book 1, chap. 3.)]  [Footnote 47: Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms. - Acosta, lib. 5, cap. 6.  Four thousand of these victims, according to Sarmiento, - we may hope it is an exaggeration, - graced the funeral obsequies of Huayna Capac, the last of the Incas before the coming of the Spaniards.  Relacion, Ms., cap. 65.]  [Footnote 48: Cieza de Leon, Cronica, cap. 62. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 6, cap. 5. - Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 8.]  The body of the deceased Inca was skilfully embalmed, and removed to the great temple of the Sun at Cuzco.  There the Peruvian sovereign, on entering the awful sanctuary, might behold the effigies of his royal ancestors, ranged in opposite files, - the men on the right, and their queens on the left, of the great luminary which blazed in refulgent gold on the walls of the temple. The bodies, clothed in the princely attire which they had been accustomed to wear, were placed on chairs of gold, and sat with their heads inclined downward, their hands placidly crossed over their bosoms, their countenances exhibiting their natural dusky hue, - less liable to change than the fresher coloring of a European complexion, - and their hair of raven black, or silvered over with age, according to the period at which they died!  It seemed like a company of solemn worshippers fixed in devotion, - so true were the forms and lineaments to life.  The Peruvians were as successful as the Egyptians in the miserable attempt to perpetuate the existence of the body beyond the limits assigned to it by nature. *49  [Footnote 49: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 29.  The Peruvians secreted these mummies of their sovereigns after the Conquest, that they might not be profaned by the insults of the Spaniards. Ondegardo, when corregidor of Cuzco, discovered five of them, three male and two female.  The former were the bodies of Viracocha, of the great Tupac Inca Yupanqui, and of his son Huayna Capac.  Garcilasso saw them in 1560.  They were dressed in their regal robes, with no insignia but the llautu on their heads.  They were in a sitting posture, and, to use his own expression, \"perfect as life, without so much as a hair or an eyebrow wanting.\" As they were carried through the streets, decently shrouded with a mantle, the Indians threw themselves on their knees, in sign of reverence, with many tears and groans, and were still more touched as they beheld some of the Spaniards themselves doffing their caps, in token of respect to departed royalty. (Ibid., ubi supra.) The bodies were subsequently removed to Lima; and Father Acosta, who saw them there some twenty years later, speaks of them as still in perfect preservation.]  They cherished a still stranger illusion in the attentions which they continued to pay to these insensible remains, as if they were instinct with life.  One of the houses belonging to a deceased Inca was kept open and occupied by his guard and attendants, with all the state appropriate to royalty.  On certain festivals, the revered bodies of the sovereigns were brought out with great ceremony into the public square of the capital. Invitations were sent by the captains of the guard of the respective Incas to the different nobles and officers of the court; and entertainments were provided in the names of their masters, which displayed all the profuse magnificence of their treasures, - and \"such a display,\" says an ancient chronicler, \"was there in the great square of Cuzco, on this occasion, of gold and silver plate and jewels, as no other city in the world ever witnessed.\" *50 The banquet was served by the menials of the respective households, and the guests partook of the melancholy cheer in the presence of the royal phantom with the same attention to the forms of courtly etiquette as if the living monarch had presided! *51  [Footnote 50: \"Tenemos por muy cierto que ni en Jerusalem, Roma, ni en Persia, ni en ninguna parte del mundo por ninguna Republica ni Rey de el, se juntaba en un lugar tanta riqueza de Metales de oro y Plata y Pedreria como en esta Plaza del Cuzco; quando estas fiestas y otras semejantes se hacian.\" Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 27.]  [Footnote 51: Idem, Relacion, Ms., cap. 8, 27. - Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms.  It was only, however, the great and good princes that were thus honored, according to Sarmiento, \"whose souls the silly people fondly believed, on account of their virtues, were in heaven, although, in truth,\" as the same writer assures us, \"they were all the time burning in the flames of hell\"! \"Digo los que haviendo sido en vida buenos y valerosos, generosos con los Indios en les hacer mercedes, perdonadores de injurias, porque a estos tales canonizaban en su ceguedad por Santos y honrraban sus huesos, sin entender que las animas ardian en los Ynfiernos y creian que estaban en el Cielo.\" Ibid., ubi supra.]  The nobility of Peru consisted of two orders, the first and by far the most important of which was that of the Incas, who, boasting a common descent with their sovereign, lived, as it were, in the reflected light of his glory. As the Peruvian monarchs availed themselves of the right of polygamy to a very liberal extent, leaving behind them families of one or even two hundred children, *52 the nobles of the blood royal, though comprehending only their descendants in the male line, came in the course of years to be very numerous. *53 They were divided into different lineages, each of which traced its pedigree to a different member of the royal dynasty, though all terminated in the divine founder of the empire.  [Footnote 52: Garcilasso says over three hundred!  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 19.) The fact, though rather startling, is not incredible, if, like Huayna Capac, they counted seven hundred wives in their seraglio.  See Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 7.]  [Footnote 53: Garcilasso mentions a class of Incas por privilegio, who were allowed to possess the name and many of the immunities of the blood royal, though only descended from the great vassals that first served under the banner of Manco Capac. (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 22.) This important fact, to which he often refers, one would be glad to see confirmed by a single authority.]  They were distinguished by many exclusive and very important privileges; they wore a peculiar dress; spoke a dialect, if we may believe the chronicler, peculiar to themselves; *54 and had the choicest portion of the public domain assigned for their support.  They lived, most of them, at court, near the person of the prince, sharing in his counsels, dining at his board, or supplied from his table.  They alone were admissible to the great offices in the priesthood.  They were invested with the command of armies, and of distant garrisons, were placed over the provinces, and, in short, filled every station of high trust and emolument. *55 Even the laws, severe in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1323"],["title","History of the Conquest of Peru (#8)"],["body","general tenor, seem not to have been framed with reference to them; and the people, investing the whole order with a portion of the sacred character which belonged to the sovereign, held that an Inca noble was incapable of crime. *56  [Footnote 54: \"Los Incas tuvieron otra Lengua particular, que hablavan entre ellos, que no la entendian los demas Indios, ni les era licito aprenderla, como Lenguage Divino.  Esta me escriven del Peru, que se ha perdido totalmente; porque como perecio la Republica particular de los Incas, perecio tambien el Lenguage dellos.\" Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 7, cap. 1]  [Footnote 55: \"Una sola gente hallo yo que era exenta, que eran los Ingas del Cuzco y por alli al rededor de ambas parcialidades, porque estos no solo no pagavan tributo, pero aun comian de lo que traian al Inga de todo el reino, y estos eran por la mayor parte los Governadores en todo el reino, y por donde quiera que iban se les hacia mucha honrra.\" Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms.]  [Footnote 56: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte I, lib. 2, cap. 15.] The other order of nobility was the Curacas, the caciques of the conquered nations, or their descendants.  They were usually continued by the government in their places, though they were required to visit the capital occasionally, and to allow their sons to be educated there as the pledges of their loyalty.  It is not easy to define the nature or extent of their privileges. They were possessed of more or less power, according to the extent of their patrimony, and the number of their vassals. Their authority was usually transmitted from father to son, though sometimes the successor was chosen by the people. *57 They did not occupy the highest posts of state, or those nearest the person of the sovereign, like the nobles of the blood. Their authority seems to have been usually local, and always in subordination to the territorial jurisdiction of the great provincial governors, who were taken from the Incas. *58  [Footnote 57: In this event, it seems, the successor named was usually presented to the Inca for confirmation.  (Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms.) At other times, the Inca himself selected the heir from among the children of the deceased Curaca.  \"In short,\" says Ondegardo, \"there was no rule of succession so sure, but it might be set aside by the supreme will of the sovereign.' Rel. Prim., Ms.]  [Footnote 58: Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 4, cap. 10. - Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 11 - Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms. - Cieza de Leon, Cronica, cap. 93. - Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.]  It was the Inca nobility, indeed, who constituted the real strength of the Peruvian monarchy.  Attached to their prince by ties of consanguinity, they had common sympathies and, to a considerable extent, common interests with him.  Distinguished by a peculiar dress and insignia, as well as by language and blood, from the rest of the community, they were never confounded with the other tribes and nations who were incorporated into the great Peruvian monarchy.  After the lapse of centuries, they still retained their individuality as a peculiar people.  They were to the conquered races of the country what the Romans were to the barbarous hordes of the Empire, or the Normans to the ancient inhabitants of the British Isles.  Clustering around the throne, they formed an invincible phalanx, to shield it alike from secret conspiracy and open insurrection.  Though living chiefly in the capital, they were also distributed throughout the country in all its high stations and strong military posts, thus establishing lines of communication with the court, which enabled the sovereign to act simultaneously and with effect on the most distant quarters of his empire.  They possessed, moreover, an intellectual preeminence, which, no less than their station, gave them authority with the people.  Indeed, it may be said to have been the principal foundation of their authority.  The crania of the Inca race show a decided superiority over the other races of the land in intellectual power; *59 and it cannot be denied that it was the fountain of that peculiar civilization and social polity, which raised the Peruvian monarchy above every other state in South America.  Whence this remarkable race came, and what was its early history, are among those mysteries that meet us so frequently in the annals of the New World, and which time and the antiquary have as vet done little to explain.  [Footnote 59: Dr. Morton's valuable work contains several engravings of both the Inca and the common Peruvian skull, showing that the facial angle in the former, though by no means great, was much larger than that in the latter, which was singularly flat and deficient in intellectual character.  Crania Americana, (Philadelphia, 1829.)]     Chapter II  Orders Of The State. - Provisions For Justice. - Division Of Lands. - Revenues And Registers. - Great Roads And Posts. - Military Tactics And Policy.   If we are surprised at the peculiar and original features of what may be called the Peruvian aristocracy, we shall be still more so as we descend to the lower orders of the community, and see the very artificial character of their institutions, - as artificial as those of ancient Sparta, and, though in a different way, quite as repugnant to the essential principles of our nature. The institutions of Lycurgus, however, were designed for a petty state, while those of Peru, although originally intended for such, seemed, like the magic tent in the Arabian tale, to have an indefinite power of expansion, and were as well suited to the most flourishing condition of the empire as to its infant fortunes.  In this remarkable accommodation to change of circumstances we see the proofs of a contrivance that argues no slight advance in civilization.  The name of Peru was not known to the natives.  It was given by the Spaniards, and originated, it is said, in a misapprehension of the Indian name of \"river.\" *1 However this may be, it is certain that the natives had no other epithet by which to designate the large collection of tribes and nations who were assembled under the sceptre of the Incas, than that of Tavantinsuyu, or \"four quarters of the world.\" *2 This will not surprise a citizen of the United States, who has no other name by which to class himself among nations than what is borrowed from a quarter of the globe. *3 The kingdom, conformably to its name, was divided into four parts, distinguished each by a separate title, and to each of which ran one of the four great roads that diverged from Cuzco, the capital or navel of the Peruvian monarchy.  The city was in like manner divided into four quarters; and the various races, which gathered there from the distant parts of the empire, lived each in the quarter nearest to its respective province.  They all continued to wear their peculiar national costume, so that it was easy to determine their origin; and the same order and system of arrangement prevailed in the motley population of the capital, as in the great provinces of the empire.  The capital, in fact, was a miniature image of the empire. *4  [Footnote 1: Pelu, according to Garcilasso, was the Indian name for \"river,\" and was given by one of the natives in answer to a question put to him by the Spaniards, who conceived it to be the name of the country.  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 1, cap. 6.) Such blunders have led to the names of many places both in North and South America.  Montesinos, however, denies that there is such an Indian term for \"river.\" (Mem. Antiguas, Ms., lib. 1, cap. 2.) According to this writer, Peru was the ancient Ophir, whence Solomon drew such stores of wealth; and which, by a very natural transition, has in time been corrupted into Phiru, Piru, Peru! The first book of the Memorias, consisting of thirty-two chapters, is devoted to this precious discovery.]  [Footnote 2: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms. - Garcilasso, Com Real., Parte 1, lib. 2, cap. 11.]  [Footnote 3: Yet an American may find food for his vanity in the reflection, that the name of a quarter of the globe, inhabited by so many civilized nations, has been exclusively conceded to him. - Was it conceded or assumed?]  [Footnote 4: Ibid., parte 1, cap. 9, 10. - Cieza de Leon, Cronica, cap. 93.  The capital was further divided into two parts, the Upper and Lower town, founded, as pretended, on the different origin of the population; a division recognized also in the inferior cities. Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms.] The four great provinces were each placed under a viceroy or governor, who ruled over them with the assistance of one or more councils for the different departments.  These viceroys resided, some portion of their time, at least, in the capital, where they constituted a sort of council of state to the Inca. *5 The nation at large was distributed into decades, or small bodies of ten; and every tenth man, or head of a decade, had supervision of the rest, - being required to see that they enjoyed the rights and immunities to which they were entitled, to solicit aid in their behalf from government, when necessary, and to bring offenders to justice.  To this last they were stimulated by a law that imposed on them, in case of neglect, the same penalty that would have been incurred by the guilty party.  With this law hanging over his head, the magistrate of Peru, we may well believe, did not often go to sleep on his post. *6  [Footnote 5: Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 2, cap. 15.  For this account of the councils I am indebted to Garcilasso, who frequently fills up gaps that have been left by his fellow-laborers.  Whether the filling up will, in all cases, bear the touch of time, as well as the rest of his work, one may doubt.]  [Footnote 6: Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms. - Montesinos, Mem. Antiguas, Ms., lib. 2, cap. 6. - Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms.  How analogous is the Peruvian to the Anglo-Saxon division into hundreds and tithings!  "]]]
