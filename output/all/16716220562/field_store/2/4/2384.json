That desperado game was simply great.  The other fellers attended to the horses, and I jest sat around lookin' vicious, and had my grub brought to me, while the women acted sorrowful and fed me pie and watermelon pickles.  When we was ready to leave next morning, Jim says: \"Now, Mr. Morgan, I'll fix up them vouchers with you,\" and givin' me the wink, I let out a yell, and jabbin' the spurs into Black Hawk, we cleared the fence and was off like a puff of dust, with the rest of 'em shootin' and screamin' after me like mad.  Say!  It was lovely--and when the boys overtook me, out of sight of the house, Morgan would have been astonished to see the sheriff, his posse, and the terrible desperado doubled up in their saddles laughin' fit to bust.  Well, sir! we never had a hitch in the proceedings for five days, and I was gettin' to feel a sort of pride in my record as a bank-robber, forger, horse-thief, and murderer, accordin' to the way Bennett presented it.  He certainly was the boss liar of the range.  He had a story framed up that painted me as the bloodiest young tough the Lone Star had ever produced, and it never failed to get me all the attention there was in the house.  One night we came to the best lookin' place we'd seen, and, in answer to Jim's summons, out walked an old man, followed by two of the prettiest girls I ever saw, who joined their father in invitin' us in.  \"Glad to be of assistance to you, Mr. Sheriff,\" he said.  \"My name is Purdy, sir!  Colonel Purdy, as you may have heard.  In the Mexican War, special mention three times for distinguished conduct.  These are my daughters, sir!  Annabel and Marie.\"  As we went in, he continued: \"You say you had a hard time gettin' your prisoner?  He looks young for a criminal.  What's he wanted for?\"  Somehow, when I saw those girls blushin' and bowin' behind their father, I didn't care to have my crimes made out any blacker'n necessary and I tried to give Jim the high-sign to let me off easy--just make it forgery or arson--but he was lookin' at the ladies, and evidently believin' in the strength of a good impression, he said: \"Well, yes!  He's young but they never was a old man with half his crimes.  He's wanted for a good many things in different places, but I went after him for horse-stealin' and murder.  Killed a rancher and his little daughter, then set fire to the house and ran off a bunch o' stock.\"  \"Oh!  Oh!  How dreadful!\" shuddered the girls, backin' off with horrified glances at me.  I tried to get near Jim to step on his foot, but the old man was glarin' at me somethin' awful.  \"Come to observe him closely, he has a depraved face,\" says he.  \"He looks the thorough criminal in every feature, dead to every decent impulse, I s'pose.\"  I could have showed him a live impulse that would have surprised him about then.  In those days I was considered a pretty handsome feller too, and I knew I had Jim beat before the draw on looks, but he continues makin' matters worse.  \"Yes, and he's desperate too.  One of the worst I ever see.  We had an awful fight with him up here on the line of the Territory.  He shot Martin and me before we got him.  Ye see, I wanted to take him alive, and so I took chances on gettin' hurt.  \"Thank ye, Miss; my arm does ache considerable; of course, if you'd jest as soon dress it--Oh, no!  I'm no braver'n anybody else, I guess.  Nice of ye to say so, anyhow,\" and he went grinnin' out into the kitchen with the girls to fix up his arm.  The old man insisted on havin' my feet bound together and me fastened to a chair, and said: \"Yes, yes, I know you can watch him, but you're in my house now, and I feel a share of the responsibility upon me. I've had experience with desperate characters and I'm goin' to be sure that this young reprobate don't escape his just punishment.  Are you sure you don't need more help gettin' him home?  I'll go with you if--\"  \"Thank ye,\" interrupted Hollis.  \"We've chased the scoundrel four hundred miles, and I reckon, now we've got him, we can keep him.\"  At supper, Jim with his arm in a new sling, sat between the two girls who cooed over him and took turns feedin' him till it made me sick.  The old man had a nigger move my chair up to the foot of the table and bring me a plate of coarse grub after they all finished eatin'.  He had tied my ankles to the lower rung of the chair himself, and when I says to the nigger, \"Those cords have plum stopped my circulation, just ease 'em up a little,\" he went straight up.  \"Don't you touch them knots, Sam!\" he roared.  \"I know how to secure a man, and don't you try any of your games in my house, either, you young fiend.  I'd never forgive myself if you escaped.\"  I ate everything I could reach, which wasn't much, and when I asked for the butter he glared at me and said: \"Butter's too good for horse-thieves; eat what's before you.\"  Every time I'd catch the eye of one of the girls and kind of grin and look enticing, she'd shiver and tell Jim that the marks of my depravity stood out on my face like warts on a toad.  Jim and the boys would all grin like idiots and invent a new crime for me.  On the square, if I'd worked nights from the age of three I couldn't have done half they blamed me for.  They put it to the old man so strong that when he turned in he chained me to Sam, the cross-eyed nigger that stood behind me at supper, and made us sleep on the floor.  I told Sam that I cut a man's throat once because he snored, and that nigger never closed an eye all night.  I was tryin' to get even with somebody.  After breakfast, when it came time to leave, Donnelly untied my feet and led me out into the yard, where the girls were hangin' around the Colonel and Jim, who was preparin' to settle up.  As we rode up the evening before, I had noticed that we turned in from the road through a lane, and that the fence was too high to jump, so, when I threw my leg over Black Hawk, I hit Donnelly a swat in the neck, and, as he did a stage-fall, I swept through the gate and down the lane.  The old man cut the halter off one of his Mexican war-whoops, and broke through the house on the run, appearin' at the front door with his shot-gun just as I checked up to make the turn onto the main road.  As I swung around, doubled over the horse's neck, he let drive with his old blunderbuss, and I caught two buckshot in my right arm where you see them marks.  I had sense enough to hang on and ride for my life, because I knew the old fire-eater would reckon it a pleasure to put an end to such a wretch as me, if he got half a chance.  I heard him howl, \"Come on boys!  We'll get him yet,\" and, over my shoulder, I saw him jump one of his loose horses standin' in the yard and come tearin' down the lane, ahead of the befuddled sheriff and posse, his white hair streamin' and the shot-gun wavin' aloft, as though chargin' an army of greasers at the head of his regiment.  From the way he drew away from the boys, I wouldn't have placed any money that he was wrong either.  I've always wondered how the old man ever got through that war with only three recommendations to the government.  He certainly kept good horses too, for in five minutes we'd left the posse behind, and I saw him madly urgin' his horse into range, reloadin' as he came.  As I threw the quirt into the mare with my good arm, I allowed I'd had about all the horse-stealin' I wanted for a while.  The old devil finally saw he was losin' ground in spite of his best efforts, and let me have both barrels.  I heard the shot patter on the hard road behind me, and hoped he'd quit and go home, but I'm blamed if he didn't chase me five miles further before turnin' back, in hopes I'd cast a shoe or something would happen to me.  I believe I was on the only horse in Texas that could have outrun the Colonel and his that mornin'.  About noon I stopped at a blacksmith's shop, half dead with pain, and had my arm dressed and a big jolt of whiskey.  As the posse rode up to me, sittin' in the sun by the lathered flanks of my horse and nursin' my arm, Jim yells out: \"Here he is!  Surround him, boys!  You're our prisoner!\"  \"No!  I'm blamed if I am,\" I says.  \"You'll have to get another desperado.  After this, I'm the sheriff!\"     THE THAW AT SLISCO'S  The storm broke at Salmon Lake, and we ran for Slisco's road-house. It whipped out from the mountains, all tore into strips coming through the saw-teeth, lashing us off the glare ice and driving us up against the river banks among the willows.  Cold?  Well, some!  My bottle of painkiller froze slushy, like lemon punch.  There's nothing like a warm shack, with a cache full of grub, when the peaks smoke and the black snow-clouds roar down the gulch.  Other \"mushers\" were ahead of us at the road-house, freighters from Kougarok, an outfit from Teller going after booze, the mail-carrier, and, who do you reckon?--Annie Black.  First time I had seen her since she was run out of Dawson for claim jumping.  Her and me hadn't been essential to one another since I won that suit over a water right on Eldorado.  \"Hello, Annie,\" says I, clawing the ice out of my whiskers; \"finding plenty of claims down here to relocate?\"  \"Shut up, you perjured pup,\" says she, full of disappointing affabilities; \"I don't want any dealings with a lying, thieving hypocrite like you, Billy Joyce.\"  Annie lacks the sporting instinct; she ain't got the disposition for cup-racing.  Never knew her to win a case, and yet she's the instigatress of more emotional activities than all the marked cards and home distilled liquor in Alaska.  \"See here,\" says I, \"a prairie dog and a rattler can hole up together, but humans has got to be congenial, so, seein' as we're all stuck to live in the same room till this blizzard blizzes out, let's forget our troubles.  I'm as game a Hibernian as the next, but I don't hibernate till there's a blaze of mutual respect going.\"  \"Blaze away,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13135"],["title","Pardners (#8)"],["body","\" says she, \"though I leave it to the crowd if you don't look and act like a liar and a grave robber.\"  Her speech is sure full of artless hostilities.  Ain't ever seen her?  Lord!  I thought everybody knew Annie Black. She drifted into camp one day, tall, slab-sided, ornery to the view, and raising fifty or upwards; disposition uncertain as frozen dynamite.  Her ground plans and elevations looked like she was laid out for a man, but the specifications hadn't been follered.  We ain't consumed by curiosity regarding the etymology of every stranger that drifts in, and as long as he totes his own pack, does his assessments, and writes his location notices proper, it goes. Leastways, it went till she hit town.  In a month she had the brotherly love of that camp gritting its teeth and throwing back twisters.  'Twas all legitimate, too, and there never was a pennyweight of scandal connected with her name.  No, sir!  Far's conduct goes, she's always been the shinin' female example of this country; but them qualities let her out.  First move was to jump Bat Ruggles's town lot.  He had four courses of logs laid for a cabin when \"Scotty\" Bell came in from the hills with $1800 in coarse gold that he'd rocked out of a prospect shaft on Bat's Moose's Creek claim.  Naturally Bat made general proclamation of thirst, and our town kinder dozed violently into a joyful three days' reverie, during which period of coma the recording time on Bat's lot ran out.  He returns from his \"hootch-hunt\" to complete the shack, and finds Annie overseeing some \"Siwashes\" put a pole roof on it.  Of course he promotes a race-war immediate, playing the white \"open\" and the red to lose, so to speak, when she up an' spanks his face, addressing expurgated, motherly cuss-words at him like he'd been a bad boy and swallered his spoon, or dug an eye out of the kitten.  Bat realizes he's against a strange system and draws out of the game.  A week later she jumps No. 3, Gold Bottom, because Donnelly stuck a pick in his foot and couldn't stay to finish the assessment.  \"I can't throw her off, or shoot her up,\" says he, \"or even cuss at her like I want to, 'cause she's a lady.\"  And it appeared like that'd been her graft ever since--presumin' on her sex to make disturbances.  In six months we hated her like pizen.  There wasn't a stampede in a hundred miles where her bloomers wasn't leading, for she had the endurance of a moose; and between excitements she prospected for trouble in the manner of relocations.  I've heard of fellers speakin' disrespectful to her and then wandering around dazed and loco after she'd got through painting word pictures of 'em.  It goes without saying she was generally popular and petted, and when the Commissioner invited her to duck out down the river, the community sighed, turned over, and had a peaceful rest--first one since she'd come in.  I hadn't seen her from that time till I blowed into Slisco's on the bosom of this forty mile, forty below blizzard.  Setting around the fire that night I found that she'd just lost another of her famous lawsuits--claimed she owned a fraction 'longside of No. 20, Buster Creek, and that the Lund boys had changed their stakes so as to take in her ground.  During the winter they'd opened up a hundred and fifty feet of awful rich pay right next to her line, and she'd raised the devil.  Injunctions, hearings and appeals, and now she was coming back, swearing she'd been \"jobbed,\" the judge had been bought, and the jury corrupted.  \"It's the richest strike in the district,\" says she.  \"They've rocked out $11,000 since snow flew, and there's 30,000 buckets of dirt on the dump.  They can bribe and bulldoze a decision through this court, but I'll have that fraction yet, the robbers.\"  \"Robbers be cussed,\" speaks up the mail man.  \"You're the cause of the trouble yourself.  If you don't get a square deal, it's your own fault--always looking for technicalities in the mining laws.  It's been your game from the start to take advantage of your skirts, what there is of 'em, and jump, jump, jump.  Nobody believes half you say. You're a natural disturber, and if you was a man you'd have been hung long ago.\"  I've heard her oral formations, and I looked for his epidermis to shrivel when she got her replications focused.  She just soared up and busted.  \"Look out for the stick,\" thinks I.  \"Woman, am I,\" she says, musical as a bum gramophone under the slow bell.  \"I take advantage of my skirts, do I?  Who are you, you mangy 'malamoot,' to criticise a lady?  I'm more of a man than you, you tin-horn; I want no favours; I do a man's work; I live a man's life; I am a man, and I'm proud of it, but you--; Nome's full of your kind; you need a woman to support you; you're a protoplasm, a polyp.  Those Swedes changed their stakes to cover my fraction.  I know it, they know it, and if it wasn't Alaska, God would know it, but He won't be in again till spring, and then the season's only three months long. I've worked like a man, suffered like a man--\"  \"Why don't ye' lose like a man?\" says he.  \"I will, and I'll fight like one, too,\" says she, while her eyes burned like faggots.  \"They've torn away the reward of years of work and agony, and they forget I can hate like a man.\"  She was stretched up to high C, where her voice drowned the howl of the storm, and her seamed old face was a sight.  I've seen mild, shrinky, mouse-shy women 'roused to hell's own fury, and I felt that night that here was a bad enemy for the Swedes of Buster Creek.  She stopped, listening.  \"What's that? There's some one at the door.\"  \"Nonsense,\" says one of the freighters.  \"You do so much knocking you can hear the echo.\"  \"There's some one at that door,\" says she.  \"If there was, they'd come in,\" says Joe.  \"Couldn't be, this late in this storm,\" I adds.  She came from behind the stove, and we let her go to the door alone. Nobody ever seemed to do any favours for Annie Black.  \"She'll be seein' things next,\" says Joe, winking.  \"What'd I tell you?  For God's sake close it--you'll freeze us.\"  Annie opened the door, and was hid to the waist in a cloud of steam that rolled in out of the blackness.  She peered out for a minute, stooped, and tugged at something in the dark.  I was at her side in a jump, and we dragged him in, snow-covered and senseless.  \"Quick--brandy,\" says she, slashing at his stiff \"mukluks.\"  \"Joe, bring in a tub of snow.\"  Her voice was steel sharp.  \"Well, I'm danged,\" says the mail man.  \"It's only an Injun.  You needn't go crazy like he was a white.\"  \"Oh, you _fool_\" says Annie.  \"Can't you see?  Esquimaux don't travel alone.  There's white men behind, and God help them if we don't bring him to.\"  She knew more about rescustications than us, and we did what she said, till at last he came out of it, groaning--just plumb wore out and numb.  \"Talk to him, Joe; you savvy their noise,\" says I.  The poor devil showed his excitement, dead as he was.  \"There's two men on the big 'Cut-off,'\" Joe translates.  \"Lost on the portage.  There was only one robe between 'em, so they rolled up in it, and the boy came on in the dark.  Says they can't last till morning.\"  \"That lets them out,\" says the mail carrier.  \"Too bad we can't reach them to-night.\"  \"What!\" snaps Annie.  \"Reach 'em?  Huh!  I said you were a jellyfish. Hurry up and get your things on, boys.\"  \"Have a little sense,\" says Joe.  \"You surely ain't a darn fool.  Out in this storm, dark as the inside of a cow; blowin' forty mile, and the 'quick' froze.  Can't be done.  I wonder who they are?\"  He \"kowtowed\" some more, and at the answer of the chattering savage we looked at Annie.  \"Him called Lund,\" shivered the Siwash.  I never see anybody harder hit than her.  I love a scrap, but I thinks \"Billy, she's having a stiffer fight than you ever associated with.\"  Finally she says, kind of slow and quiet: \"Who knows where the 'Cut-off' starts?\"  Nobody answers, and up speaks the U. S. man again.  \"You've got your nerve, to ask a man out on such a night.\"  \"If there was one here, I wouldn't have to ask him.  There's people freezing within five miles of here, and you hug the stove, saying: 'It's stormy, and we'll get cold.'  Of course it is.  If it wasn't stormy they'd be here too, and it's so cold, you'll probably freeze. What's that got to do with it?  Ever have your mother talk to you about duty?  Thank Heaven I travelled that portage once, and I can find it again if somebody will go with me.\"  'Twas a blush raising talk, but nobody upset any furniture getting dressed.  She continues:  \"So I'm the woman of this crowd and I hide behind my skirts.  Mr. Mail Man, show what a glorious creature you are.  Throw yourself--get up and stretch and roar.  Oh, you barn-yard bantam!  Has it had its pap to-night?  I've a grand commercial enterprise; I'll take all of your bust measurements and send out to the States for a line of corsets.  Ain't there half a man among you?\"  She continued in this vein, pollutin' the air, and, having no means of defence, we found ourselves follerin' her out into a yelling storm that beat and roared over us like waves of flame.  Swede luck had guided their shaft onto the richest pay-streak in seven districts, and Swede luck now led us to the Lund boys, curled up in the drifted snow beside their dogs; but it was the level head and cool judgment of a woman that steered us home in the grey whirl of the dawn.  During the deathly weariness of that night I saw past the calloused hide of that woman and sighted the splendid courage cached away beneath her bitter oratory and hosstyle syllogisms.  \"There's a story there,\" thinks I, \"an' maybe a man moved in it--though I can't imagine her softened by much affection.\"  It pleased some guy to state that woman's the cause of all our troubles, but I figger they're like whisky--all good, though some a heap better'n others, of course, and when a frail, little, ninety pound woman gets to bucking and acting bad, there's generally a "]]]
