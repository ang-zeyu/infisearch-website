'Thank God, I don't believe money will matter nearly as much to people, after the war!' said Sarratt, with energy. 'It's astonishing how now, in the army--of course it wasn't the same before the war--you forget it entirely. Who cares whether a man's rich, or who's son he is? In my batch when I went up to Aldershot there were men of all sorts, stock-brokers, landowners, city men, manufacturers, solicitors, some of them awfully rich, and then clerks, and schoolmasters, and lots of poor devils, like myself. We didn't care a rap, except whether a man took to his drill, or didn't; whether he was going to keep the Company back or help it on. And it's just the same in the field. Nothing counts but what you _are_--it doesn't matter a brass hap'orth what you have. And as the new armies come along that'll be so more and more. It's \"Duke's son and Cook's son,\" everywhere, and all the time. If it was that in the South African war, it's twenty times that now. This war is bringing the nation together as nothing ever has done, or could do. War is hellish!--but there's a deal to be said for it!'  He spoke with ardour, as they strolled homeward, along the darkening shore, she hanging on his arm. Nelly said nothing. Her little face showed very white in the gathering shadows. He went on.  'There was a Second Lieutenant in our battalion, an awfully handsome boy--heir to a peerage I think. But he couldn't get a commission quick enough to please him when the war broke out, so he just enlisted--oh! of course they've given him a commission long ago. But his great friend was a young miner, who spoke broad Northumberland, a jolly chap. And these two stuck together--we used to call them the Heavenly Twins. And in the fighting round Hill 60, the miner got wounded, and lay out between the lines, with the Boche shells making hell round him. And the other fellow never rested till he'd crawled out to him, and taken him water, and tied him up, and made a kind of shelter for him. The miner was a big fellow, and the other was just a slip of a boy. So he couldn't drag in his friend, but he got another man to go out with him, and between them they did it right enough. And when I was in the clearing station next day, I saw the two--the miner in bed, awfully smashed up, and the other sitting by him. It made one feel choky. The boy could have put down a cool hundred thousand, I suppose, if it could have done any good. But it wouldn't. I can tell you, darling, this war knocks the nonsense out of a man!'  'But Bridget is a woman!' said a dreamy voice beside him.  Sarratt laughed; but he was launched on recollections and could not stop himself. Apparently everybody in his company was a hero, and had deserved the Military Cross ten times over, except himself. He described some incidents he had personally seen, and through the repressed fire with which he spoke, the personality and ideals of the man revealed themselves--normal, strong, self-forgetting. Had he even forgotten the little creature beside him? Hardly, for instinctively he softened away some of the terrible details of blood and pain. But he had forgotten Nelly's prohibition. And when again they had entered the dark wood which lay between them and the cottage on the river-bank, suddenly he heard a trembling breath, and a sob.  He caught her in his arms.  'Nelly, darling! Oh, I was a brute to talk to you like this.'  'No,' she said, struggling with herself--'No! Wait a moment.' She lay against him trembling through every limb, while he kissed and comforted her.  'I'm--I'm not a coward, George!' she said at last, gasping,--'I'm not indeed. Only--well, this morning I had about a hundred and seventy hours left--I counted them. And now there are fifteen less. And all the time, while we talk, they are slipping away, so quick--so quick--'  But she was regaining self-control, and soon released herself.  'I won't do it again!' she said piteously, in the tone of a penitent child. 'I won't indeed. Let's go home. I'm all right.'  And home they sped, hand in hand, silently. The little room when they re-entered it was bright with firelight, because kind Mrs. Weston had thought the flight chilly, and the white table laid out for them--its pretty china and simple fare--tempted and cheered them with its look of home. But Nelly lay on the sofa afterwards very pale, though smiling and talking as usual. And through the night she was haunted, sleeping and waking, by the image of the solitary boat rocking gently on the moonlit lake, the water lapping its sides. She saw herself and George adrift in it--sailing into--disappearing in--that radiance of silver light. Sleepily she hoped that Sir William Farrell would not forget his promise.     CHAPTER III   May I come in?'  Nelly Sarratt, who was standing beside the table in the sitting-room, packing a small luncheon-basket with sandwiches and cake, looked up in astonishment. Then she went to the door which was slightly ajar, and opened it.  She beheld a very tall man standing smiling on the threshold.  'I hope I'm not disturbing you, Mrs. Sarratt--but I was on my way for a day's sketching, and as my car passed your house, I thought I would like to bring you, myself, the permission which I spoke of on Saturday. I wrote yesterday, my friend was away from home but I got a telegram this morning.'  The visitor held out a telegram, which Nelly took in some bewilderment. It fluttered her to be so much thought for by a stranger--and a stranger moreover who seemed but to wave his wand and things were done. But she thanked him heartily.  'Won't you come in, Sir William?' she asked him, shyly. 'My husband will be here directly.'  It pleased him that she had found out who he was. He protested that he mustn't stay a moment, but all the same he came in, and stood with his hands in his pockets looking at the view. He seemed to Nelly to fill the little sitting-room. Not that he was stout. There was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on him anywhere. But he stood at least six foot four in his boots; his shoulders were broad in proportion; and his head, with its strong curly hair of a light golden brown, which was repeated in his short beard, carried itself with the unconscious ease of one who has never known anything but the upper seats of life. His features were handsome, except for a broad irregular mouth, and his blue eyes were kind and lazily humorous.  'There's nothing better than that lake,' he said, motioning towards it, with his hand, as though he followed the outlines of the hills. 'But I never try to draw it. I leave that to the fellows who think they can! I'm afraid your permit's only for a week, Mrs. Sarratt. The boat, I find, will be wanted after that.'  'Oh, but my husband will be gone in a week--less than a week. I couldn't row myself!' said Nelly, smiling.  But Sir William thought the smile trembled a little, and he felt very sorry for the small, pretty creature.  'You will be staying on here after your husband goes?'  'Oh yes. My sister will be with me. We know the Lakes very well.'  'Staying through the summer, I suppose?' 'I shan't want to move--if the war goes on. We haven't any home of our own--yet.'  She had seated herself, and spoke with the self-possession which belongs to those who know themselves fair to look upon. But there seemed to be no coquetry about her--no consciousness of a male to be attracted. All her ways were very gentle and childish, and in her white dress she made the same impression on Farrell as she had on Bridget, of extreme--absurd--youthfulness. He guessed her age about nineteen, perhaps younger.  'I'm afraid the war will go on,' he said, kindly. 'We are only now just finding out our deficiencies.'  Nelly sighed.  'I know--it's _awful_ how we want guns and shells! My husband says it makes him savage to see how we lose men for want of them. _Why_ are we so short? Whose fault is it?'  A spot of angry colour had risen in her cheek. It was the dove defending her mate. The change was lovely, and Farrell, with his artist's eye, watched it eagerly. But he shook his head.  'It's nobody's fault. It's all on such a scale--unheard of! Nobody could have guessed before-hand--unless like Germany, we had been preparing for years to rob and murder our neighbours. Well, Mrs. Sarratt, I must be going on. But I wanted to say, that if we could do anything for you--please command us. We live about twenty miles from here. My sister hopes she may come and see you. And we have a big library at Carton. If there are any books you want--'  'Oh, how _very_ kind of you!' said Nelly gratefully. She had risen and was standing beside him, looking at him with her dark, frank eyes. 'But indeed I shall get on very well. There's a war workroom in Manchester, which will send me work. And I shall try and help with the sphagnum moss. There's a notice up near here, asking people to help. 'And perhaps'--she laughed and colored--'I shall try to sketch a little. I can't do it a bit--but it amuses me.'  'Oh, you _draw_?' said Farrell, with a smile. Then, looking round him, he noticed a portfolio on the table, with a paint box beside it. 'May I look?'  With rather red cheeks, Nelly showed her performances. She knew very well, being accustomed to follow such things in the newspapers, that Sir William Farrell had exhibited both in London and Manchester, and was much admired by some of the critics.  Farrell twisted his mouth over them a good deal, considering them carefully.  'Yes, I see--I see exactly where you are. Not bad at all, some of them. I could lend you some things which would help you I think. Ah, here is your husband.'  George Sarratt entered, looking in some surprise at their very prompt visitor, and a little inclined to stand on his guard against a patronage that might be troublesome. But Farrell explained himself so apologetically that the young man could only add his very hearty thanks to his wife's.  'Well, I really"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12908"],["title","Missing (#6)"],["body","be off,' said Farrell again, looking for his hat. 'And I see you are going out for the day.' He glanced at the lunch preparations. 'Do you know Loughrigg Tarn?' He turned to Nelly.  'Oh, yes!' Her face glowed. 'Isn't it beautiful? But I don't think George knows it.' She looked up at him. He smiled and shook his head.  'I have a cottage there,' said Farrell, addressing Sarratt. 'Wordsworth said it was like Nemi. It isn't:--but it's beautiful all the same. I wish you would bring your wife there to tea with me one day before you go? There is an old woman who looks after me. This view is fine'--he pointed to the window--'but I think mine is finer.'  'Thank you,' said Sarratt, rather formally--'but I am afraid our days are getting pretty full.'  'Of course, of course!' said Sir William, smiling. 'I only meant, if you happened to be walking in that direction and want a rest. I have a number of drawings there--my own and other people's, which Mrs. Sarratt might care to see--sometime. You go on Saturday?'  'Yes. I'm due to rejoin by Monday.'  Farrell's expression darkened.  'You see what keeps me?' he said, sharply, striking his left knee with the flat of his hand. 'I had a bad fall, shooting in Scotland, years ago--when I was quite a lad. Something went wrong in the knee-cap. The doctors muffed it, and I have had a stiff knee ever since. I daresay they'd give me work at the War Office--or the Admiralty. Lots of fellows I know who can't serve are doing war-work of that kind. But I can't stand office work--never could. It makes me ill, and in a week of it I am fit to hang myself. I live out of doors. I've done some recruiting--speaking for the Lord Lieutenant. But I can't speak worth a cent--and I do no good. No fellow ever joined up because of my eloquence!--couldn't if he tried. No--I've given up my house--it was the best thing I could do. It's a jolly house, and I've got lots of jolly things in it. But the War Office and I between us have turned it into a capital hospital. We take men from the Border regiments mostly. I wonder if I shall ever be able to live in it again! My sister and I are now in the agent's house. I work at the hospital three or four days a week--and then I come here and sketch. I don't see why I shouldn't.'  He straightened his shoulder as though defying somebody. Yet there was something appealing, and, as it were, boyish, in the defiance. The man's patriotic conscience could be felt struggling with his dilettantism. Sarratt suddenly liked him.  'No, indeed,' he said heartily. 'Why shouldn't you?' 'It's when one thinks of _your_ job, one feels a brute to be doing anything one likes.'  'Well, you'd be doing the same job if you could. That's all right!' said Sarratt smiling.  It was curious how in a few minutes the young officer had come to seem the older and more responsible of the two men. Yet Farrell was clearly his senior by some ten or fifteen years. Instinctively Nelly moved nearer to George. She liked to feel how easily he could hold his own with great people, who made _her_ feel nervous. For she understood from Mrs. Weston that the Farrells were very great people indeed, as to money and county position, and that kind of thing.  Sarratt took his visitor downstairs, and returned, laughing to himself.  'Well, darling, I've promised we'll go to his cottage one day this week. You've to let him know. He's an odd fellow! Reminds me of that story of the young Don at Cambridge who spent all the time he could spare from neglecting his duties in adorning his person. And yet that doesn't hit it quite either. For I don't suppose he does spend much time in adorning his person. He doesn't want it. He's such a splendid looking chap to begin with. But I'm sure his duties have a poor time! Why, he told me--me, an utter stranger!--as we went downstairs--that being a landowner was the most boring trade in the world. He hated his tenants, and turned all the bother of them over to his agents. \"But they don't hate me\"--he said--\"because I don't put the screw on. I'm rich enough without.\" By Jove, he's a queer specimen!'  And Sarratt laughed out, remembering some further items of the conversation on the stairs.  'Whom are you discussing?' said a cold voice in the background.  It was Bridget Cookson's voice, and the husband and wife turned to greet her. The day was balmy--June at its best. But Bridget as she came in had the look of someone rasped with east wind. Nelly noticed too that since her marriage, Bridget had developed an odd habit of not looking her--or George--straight in the face. She looked sideways, as though determined to avoid the mere sight of their youth and happiness. 'Is she going to make a quarrel of it all our lives?' thought Nelly impatiently. 'And when George is so nice to her! How can she be so silly!'  'We were talking about our visitor who has just left,' said Sarratt, clearing a chair for his sister-in-law. 'Ah, you came from the other direction, you just missed him.'  'The man'--said Nelly--'who was so awfully polite to me on Saturday--Sir William Farrell.'  Bridget's countenance lost its stiffness at once--became eager and alert.  'What did he come for?'  'To bring us permission to use the boat for a week,' said Nelly. 'Wasn't it decent of him?--and to do it so quick!'  'Oh, that's the Farrell way--always was,' said Bridget complacently, as though she had the family in her pocket. 'When they think of a thing it's done. It's hit or miss. They never stop to think.'  Sarratt looked at his sister-in-law with a covert amusement. It was a left-handed remark. But she went on--while Nelly finished the packing of the luncheon-basket--pouring out a flood of gossip about the Farrells's place near Cockermouth, their great relations, their wealth, their pictures, and their china, while Sarratt walked up and down, fidgeting with his mouth, and inwardly thanking his stars that his Nelly was not the least like her sister, that she was as refined and well-bred, as Bridget was beginning to seem to him vulgar and tiresome. But he realised that there was a personality in the tall harsh woman; that she might be formidable; and once or twice he found himself watching the curious side-long action of her head and neck, and the play of her eyes and mouth, with a mingling of close attention and strong dislike. He kept his own counsel however; and presently he heard Bridget, who had so far refused all their invitations to join their walks or excursions, rather eagerly accepting Nelly's invitation to go with them to Sir William's Loughrigg cottage. She knew all about it apparently, and said it was 'a gem of a place!' Sir William kept an old butler and his wife there--pensioned off--who looked after him when he came. 'Everything's tiny,' said Bridget with emphasis--'but _perfect_! Sir William has the most exquisite taste. But he never asks anybody to go there. None of the neighbours know him. So of course they say its \"side,\" and he gives himself airs. Anyway, Nelly, you may think yourselves highly honoured--'  'Darling, isn't that basket ready?' said Sarratt, coming to his wife's aid. 'We're losing the best of the day--and if Bridget really won't go with us--'  Bridget frowned and rose.  'How are the proofs getting on?' said Sarratt, smiling, as she bade him a careless good-bye.  Bridget drew herself up.  'I never talk about my work.'  'I suppose that's a good rule,' he said doubtfully, 'especially now that there's so much else to talk about. The Russian news to-day is pretty bad!'  A dark look of anxiety crossed the young man's face. For it was the days of the great Russian retreat in Galicia and Poland, and every soldier looking on, knew with gnashing of teeth that the happenings in the East meant a long postponement of our own advance.  'Oh, I never trouble about the war!' said Bridget, with a half-contemptuous note in her voice that fairly set George Sarratt on fire. He flushed violently, and Nelly looked at him in alarm. But he said nothing. Nelly however with a merry side-glance at him, unseen by Bridget, interposed to prevent him from escorting Bridget downstairs. She went herself. Most sisters would have dispensed with or omitted this small attention; but Nelly always treated Bridget with a certain ceremony. When she returned, she threw her arms round George's neck, half laughing, and half inclined to cry.  'Oh, George, I do wish I had a nicer sister to give you!' But George had entirely recovered himself.  'We shall get on perfectly!' he declared, kissing the soft head that leant against him. 'Give me a little time, darling. She's new to me!--I'm new to her.'  Nelly sighed, and went to put on her hat. In her opinion it was no more easy to like Bridget after three years than three hours. It was certain that she and George would never suit each other. At the same time Nelly was quite conscious that she owed Bridget a good deal. But for the fact that Bridget did the housekeeping, that Bridget saw to the investment of their small moneys, and had generally managed the business of their joint life, Nelly would not have been able to dream, and sketch, and read, as it was her delight to do. It might be, as she had said to Sarratt, that Bridget managed because she liked managing. All the same Nelly knew, not without some prickings of conscience as to her own dependence, that when George was gone, she would never be able to get on without Bridget.  Into what a world of delight the two plunged when they set forth! The more it rains in the Westmorland country, the more heavenly are the days when the clouds forget to rain! There were white flocks of them in the June sky as the new-married pair crossed the wooden bridge beyond the garden, leading to the further side of the lake, but they were sailing serene and sunlit in the blue, as though their whole business were to dapple the hills with blue and violet shadows, or sometimes to throw a dazzling reflection down into the quiet water. There had been rain,"]]]
