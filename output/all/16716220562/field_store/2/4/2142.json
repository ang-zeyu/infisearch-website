Then she would cheerfully devote fifteen days of incessant stitching at something she carried round in a sort of drumhead.  At the end of that time she would have completed a more or less intolerable piece of colored fabric which she called a \"drape\" or a \"throw.\"  It could not be duplicated at a shop for less than $1.75, and it would wash perhaps three times.  Mr. Budlong once figured that if sweat-shop proprietors paid wages at the scale Mrs. Budlong established for herself, all the seamstresses and seamsters would curl up round their machines and die of starvation the first week.  But he never told Mrs. Budlong this. Fancy stitching did not earn much, but it did not cost much; and it kept her mysteriously contented.  She was stitching herself to her own home all the time.  The Christmas presents Mrs. Budlong made herself were not all a matter of needle and thread.  Not at all!  One year she turned her sewing room into a smithy.  She gave Mr. and Mrs. Doctor Tisnower the loveliest hand-hammered brass coal scuttle that ever was seen--and with a purple ribbon tied to its tail.  They kept flowers in it several summers, till one cruel winter a new servant put coal in it and completely scuttled it.  The same year she gave Mrs. ex-Mayor Cinnamon a hammered brass version of a C. D. Gibson drawing.  The lady and gentleman looked as if they had broken out with a combination of yellow fever and smallpox, or suffered from enlarged pores or something.  And the plum-colored plush frame didn't sit very well on the vermilion wall paper.  But Mrs. Cinnamon hung it over the sofa in the expectation of changing the paper some day.  It stayed there until the fateful evening when Mr. Nelson Chur called on Miss Editha Cinnamon and was just warming up a proposal that had held over almost as long as the wall paper, when bang! down came the overhanging brass drawing and bent itself hopelessly on Mr. Chur's skull.  Mr. Chur said something that may have been Damocles.  But he did not propose, and Mrs. Budlong was weeks wondering why Mrs. Cinnamon was so snippy to her.  The hammered brass era gave way to the opposite extreme of painted velvet.  They say it is a difficult art; and it may well be.  Mrs. Budlong's first landscape might as well have been painted on the side of her Scotch collie.  Her most finished roses had something of the look of shaggy tarantulas that had fallen into a paint pot and emerged in a towering rage.  It was in that velvetolene stratum that she painted for the church a tasseled pulpit cloth that hung down a yard below the Bible. Dr. Torpadie was a very soothing preacher, but no one slept o'sermons during the reign of that pulpit cloth.  Mrs. Budlong was so elated over the success of it, however, that she announced her intention of going in for stained glass.  She planned a series of the sweetest windows to replace those already in the church.  But she never got nearer to that than painted china.  The painted china era was a dire era.  The cups would break and the colors would run, and they never came out what she expected after they were fired.  Of course she knew that the pigments must suffer alteration in the furnace, but there was always a surprise beyond surprise.  She soon became accustomed to getting green roses with crimson leaves, and deep blue apple blossoms against a pure white sky, but when she finished one complete set of table china in fifty pieces, each cup and saucer with a flower on it, the result looked so startlingly like something from a medical museum, that she never dared give the set away.  She lent it to the cook to eat her meals on.  The set went fast.  During this epoch Master Ulysses Budlong Jr. was studying at school a physiology ornamented with a few pictures in color representing the stomachs of alcohol specialists.  They were intended, perhaps, to frighten little school children from frequenting saloons during recess, or to warn them not to put whisky on their porridge.  It was at this time that Mrs. Budlong spent two weeks' hard labor painting Easter lilies on an umbrella jug.  When it came home from the furnace, her husband stared at it and mumbled:  \"It's artistic, but what is it?\"  Little Ulysses shrieked: \"Oh, I know!\" and darting away, returned with his physiology opened at one of those gastric sunsets, and--well, it was this that impelled Mrs. Budlong to a solemn pledge never to paint china again--a pledge she has nobly kept.  From smeared china she went to that art in which a woman buys something at a store, pulls out half of it, and calls the remnant drawn work.  A season of this was succeeded by a mania for sofa cushions.  It fairly snowed sofa cushions all over Carthage that Christmas; and Yale, Harvard and Princeton pillows could be found in homes that had never known even a night school alumnus.  There ensued a sober period of burnt wood and a period of burnt leather, during which excited neighbors with a keen sense of smell called the fire department three times and the board of health once. And now Indian heads broke out all over town and the walls looked as if a shoemaker's apron had been chosen for the national pennant.  There were various other spasms of manufacture, each of them fashionable at its time and foolish at anytime.  As Mr. Detwiller said:  \"Somebody ought to write a history of Mrs. Budlong's Christmas presents.  It would tell the complete story of all the darned fool fads that American women have been up to for twenty years.\"  But foolish soever, Mrs. Budlong was fair.  A keen sense of sportsmanship led her to give full notice to such people as she planned to honor with her gifts.  She knew how embarrassing it is to receive presents from one to whom no present has been sent, and she made it a point of honor somehow to forewarn her prospective beneficiaries betimes.  Her favorite method was the classic device of pretending to let slip a secret.  For instance:  \"Yesterday morning, my dear, I had the Strangest exPerience.  It was just ten o'clock.  I remember the hour so exactly because for the last few days I have made it a rule to begin work on your Christmas present just at ten--Oh, but I didn't mean to tell you.  It was to be a surprise.  No, don't ask me, I won't give you an inkling, but I really think it will please you.  It's something you've been needing for Such a long time.\"  And she left the victim to writhe from then on to Christmas, trying alternately to imagine what gift was impending and what would be an appropriate counter-gift.     III  MISTRESS OF THE REVELS  In more ways than one Mrs. Budlong kept Carthage on the writhe. Christmas was merely the climax of a ceaseless activity.  All the year round she was at work like a yeast alert in a soggy dough.  She was forever getting up things.  She was one of those terrible women who return calls on time or a little ahead.  That made it necessary for you to return hers earlier.  If you didn't, she called you up on the telephone and asked you why you hadn't.  You had to promise to come over at once or she'd talk to you till your ear was welded to the telephone.  Then if you broke your promise she called you up about that.  She got in from fifty-two to a hundred and four calls a year, where one or two would have amply sufficed for all she had to say.  It was due to her that Carthage had such a lively social existence--for its size.  Once, when she fell ill, the people felt suddenly as passengers feel when a street car is suddenly braked back on its haunches.  All Carthage found itself wavering and poised on tiptoe and clinging to straps; and then it sogged back on its heels and waited till the car should resume progress.  Mrs. Budlong was the town's motorman--or \"motorneer,\" as they say in Carthage.  Before she was out of bed, she had invitations abroad for a convalescent tea, and everybody said, \"Here we go again!\"  If strangers visited Carthage, Mrs. Budlong counted them her clients the moment they arrived.  Of course, the merely commercial visitors she left to the hackmen at the station, but friends or relatives of prominent people could not escape Mrs. Budlong's well-meant attentions.  It was sometimes embarrassing when relatives appeared--for everybody has Concealed Relatives that he is perfectly willing to leave in concealment.  Mrs. Alex. (pronounced Ellick) Stubblebine never forgave Mrs. Budlong for dragging into the limelight some obscure cousins of her husband's who had drifted into Carthage to borrow money on their farm.  Mrs. Stubblebine was always bragging about her people, her own people that is.  Her husband's people, of course, were after all only Stubblebines, while her maiden name was Dilatush; and the Dilatushes, as everybody knew, were related by marriage to the Tatums.  But these were Stubblebines that came to town.  Mrs. Stubblebine could hardly slam the door in their faces, but she would fain have locked the doors after them.  She would not even invite them out on the front porch.  She told them the back porch was cosier and less conspicuous.  And then Mrs. Budlong had to call up on the telephone and sing out in her telephoniest tone:  \"Oh, my dear, I've just this minute heard you have guests--some of your dear husband's relatives.  Now they must come to me to dinner to-morrow.  Oh, it isn't the slightest trouble, I asSure you.  I'm giving a little party anyway.  I won't take no for an answer.\"  And she wouldn't.  Mrs. Stubblebine fairly perspired excuses, but Mrs. Budlong finally grew so suspicious that she had to accept; or leave the impression that the relatives were burglars or counterfeiters in hiding.  And they were not--they were pitifully honest.  The result was even worse than she feared.  Mr. Stubblebine's cousin was so shy that he never said a word except when it was pulled out of him, and then he said, \"Yes, ma'am\"!  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12881"],["title","Mrs. Budlong's Christmas Presents (#2)"],["body","Carthage when you are at a dinner party and you don't quite catch the last remark, you don't snap \"What?\" or \"How?\" or \"Wha' jew say?\" Whatever your home habits may be, at a dinner party or before comp'ny, you raise your eyebrows gracefully and murmur, \"I beg your pardon.\"  But Mr. Stubblebine's rural cousin grunted \"Huh?\"--like an Indian chief trying to scare a white general.  And he was perfectly frank about the intimate processes of mastication.  And when he dropped a batch of scalloped oysters into his watch pocket he solemnly fished them-out with a souvenir after-dinner coffee spoon having the Statue of Liberty for a handle and Brooklyn Bridge in the bowl.  And the wretch's wife was so nervous that she talked all the time about people the others had never seen or heard of.  And she said she \"never used tomattus.\"  And she wasn't ashamed of what she was chewing either.  Mrs. Stubblebine would have felt much obliged to fate if she had been presented with an apoplectic stroke.  But she had to sit the dinner out.  From what she said to her poor husband afterward, however, one might have gathered that he picked out those relatives just to spite her, when as a matter of fact he had always loathed them and regretted them and the next day he borrowed enough money to lend them and send them back to the soil.  Mrs. Budlong had constituted herself Entertainment Committee for all sorts of visitors.  If a young girl came home from boarding school with a classmate, the real hostess had hardly time to show her to the spare room, and say, \"This is the bathroom, round here; watch out for the step.  And if the water don't run just wait--\" when the telephone would go Brrrrr!  And there would be Mrs. Budlong brandishing an invitation to a dinner party.  When the supply of guests ran low she would visit the sick.  If a worn-out housewife slept late some morning to catch up, Mrs. Budlong would hear of it and rush over with a broth or something.  It is said that old Miss Malkin got out of bed with an unfinished attack of pneumonia, just to keep from eating any more of Mrs. Budlong's wine jellies.  In Carthage one pays for the telephone by the year.  The company lost money on Mrs. Budlong's wire.  As a telephoner she was simply interminable.  She would spend a weekend at the instrument while the prisoner at the other extreme of the wire shifted from ear to ear, sagged along the wall, postponed household duties, made signals of distress to other members of the family, and generally cursed Mr. Alexander Graham Bell for his ingenuity.  Three wall telephones were changed to table phones on Mrs. Budlong's account, and Mrs. Talbot had hers put by the bed.  She used to take naps while Mrs. Budlong talked and she trained herself to murmur, \"Yes, dear,\" at intervals in her sleep.  By means like this Mrs. Budlong kept Carthage more or less under her thumb.  Carthage squirmed but it could not crawl out from under.  This is the story of how the thumb was removed for good and all.  It was Mrs. Budlong herself that removed it.  Carthage could never have pried it up.  And strange to say the thumb came off because it grew popular.  Hitherto Mrs. Budlong had never been truly popular.  People were merely afraid of her.  She was a whipper-in, a social bush-beater, driving the populace from cover like partridges.  She would not let the town rest.  The merchants alone admired her, for she was the cause of much buying of new shoes, new hats, new clothes, fine groceries, olives, Malaga grapes, salted almonds, raisins, English walnuts and other things that one eats only at parties.  She was the first woman in Carthage that ever gave a luncheon and called it breakfast, as years before she had been the first hostess to give a dinner at any time except in the middle of the day.  Also, she was the first person there to say, \"Come to me\" when she meant \"Come to our house.\"  It had a Scriptural sound and was thought shocking until Carthage grew used to it.  It was due to her that several elderly men were forced into their first evening dress.  They had thought to escape through life without that ordeal.  Old Clute would have preferred to be fitted for a pine box, and would have felt about as comfortable in it.  He tried to compromise with the tailor on a garment that could serve as a Prince Albert by day and a \"swaller tail\" by night, but Mr. Kweskin could not manage it even though his Christian name was Moses.  So Mr. Clute blamed Mrs. Budlong for yet another expense.  Husbands all over town were blaming Mrs. Budlong for running their families into fool extravagances.  Mothers were blaming her for dragging them round by the nose and leaving them no rest.  But everybody in town resentfully obeyed Mrs. Budlong, though Mrs. Roscoe Detwiller wanted to organize a HomeKeepers Union, and strike.  For the women never dared trust themselves about the house in a wrapper, since Mrs. Budlong might happen in as like as not--rather liker than not.  And then, just as the town was fermenting for revolt, Mrs. Budlong came into a lot of money.     IV  ONLY A MILLIONAIRE  That is, Mr. Budlong came into a lot of money.  Which meant that Mr. Budlong would be permitted to take care of it while his wife got rid of it.  One of those relatives, very common in fiction, and not altogether unknown in real life, finally let go of her money at the behest of her impatient undertaker.  The Budlongs had the pleasure of seeing the glorious news of their good fortune in big headlines in the Carthage papers.  It was the only display Mr. Budlong ever received in that paper without paying for it--excepting the time when he ran for Mayor on the opposition ticket and was referred to in letters an inch high as \"Candidate Nipped-in-the-Budlong.\"  But now the cornucopia of plenty had burst wide open on the front porch.  It seemed as if they would have to wade through gold dollars to get to their front gate--when the money was collected.  When the money was collected.  And now it was Mrs.  Budlong's telephone that rang and rang.  It was she that was called up and called up.  It was she that sagged along the wall and shifted from foot to foot, from elbow to elbow and ear to ear.  After living in Carthage all her life she was suddenly, as it were, welcomed to the city as a distinguished visiting stranger.  And now she had no need to invite people to return their calls.  They came spontaneously.  Sometimes there were a dozen calling at once.  It was a reception every day.  There were overflow meetings in the room which Mrs. Budlong called Mr. Budlong's \"den.\" This was the place where she kept the furniture that she didn't dare keep in the parlor.  People who had never come to see her in spite of her prehensile telephone, dropped in to pay up some musty old call that had lain unreturned for years.  People who had always come formally, even funereally, rushed in as informally and with as devouring an enthusiasm as old chums.  People who used to run in informally now drove up in vehicles from MacMulkin's livery stable; or if they came in their own turn-outs they had the tops washed and the harness polished, and the gardener and furnaceman who drove, had his hat brushed, was not allowed to smoke, and was urged to sit up straight and for heaven's sake to keep his foot off the dashboard.  People who had been in the habit of devoting a day or two to cleaning up a year's social debts and went up and down the streets dropping doleful calls like wreaths on headstones, walked in unannounced of mornings.  It was now Mrs. Budlong that had to keep dressed up all day. Everybody accepted the inevitable invitations to have a cup of tea, till the cook struck.  Cook said she had conthracted to cuke for a small family, not to run a continurous bairbecue.  Besides she had to answer the doorbell so much she couldn't get her hands into the dough, before they were out again.  And dinner was never ready.  The amount of tea consumed and bakery cake and the butter, began to alarm Mrs. Budlong.  And Carthage people were so nervous at taking tea with a millionairess that they kept dropping cups or setting saucers down too hard.  Mrs. Budlong had never a moment the whole day long to leave the house, and she suddenly found herself without a call returned.  She had so many invitations to dinners and luncheons, that her life became a hop, skip and jump.  During the first ecstasy of the good news, Mrs. Budlong had raved over the places she was going to travel,--Paris (now pronounced Paree), London, Vienna, St. Marks, the Lion of Lucerne--she talked like a handbook of Cook's Tours.  To successive callers she told the story over and over till the rhapsody finally palled on her own tongue.  She began to hate Paree, London, Vienna, St. Marks, and to loathe the Lion of Lucerne.  All she wanted to do was to get out of town to some quiet retreat.  Carthage was no longer quiet.  It simmered to the boiling-over point.  Once it had been Mrs. Budlong's pride to be the social leader of Carthage.  Now that her husband was worth (or to be worth) a hundred thousand dollars Carthage seemed a very petty parish to be the social leader of.  She began to read New York society notes with expectancy, as one cons the Baedeker of a town one is approaching.  She lay awake nights wondering what she should wear at Mrs. Stuyvesant Square's next party and at Mrs. Astor House's sociable.  She fretted the choice whether she should take a letter from her church to St. Bartholomew's or to Grace or St. John's the Divine's.  And all the while she was pouring tea for the wives of harness makers and druggists, dentists and grocers.  The more reason for not appearing before them in the same clothes incessantly.  But with a dinner or a reception or a tea or a ball every night, her two dressy-up dresses became so familiar that at one party when she was coming downstairs from laying off her cloak people spoke to her dress before they could see her face.  And she could"]]]
