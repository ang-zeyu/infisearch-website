They had hoped to be ordered to the coast. But, as Archie remarked, it was \"too late to back out,\" and they were obliged to submit. When Archie came to bid farewell to his parents, he found it to be a much more difficult task than he had expected. The tears would come to his eyes, in spite of himself, as he embraced his mother; and, as soon as he could disengage himself from her arms, he seized his bag and hammock, and rushed out of the house to conceal his emotion. When they reached the depot, they found that the draft to which they belonged numbered nearly two hundred men, some of whom were old sailors, while others, like themselves, were entirely unacquainted with the life they were about to lead.  The journey to Cairo--which was then the naval depot of the Western rivers--was a long and tedious one. They were treated with the greatest kindness by the officers who accompanied them, and at almost every station the people would flock around the cars with baskets of provisions, which were freely distributed.  Early on the fifth morning they reached their destination, and were immediately marched on board a small steamer which lay alongside of the naval wharf-boat, and carried to the receiving-ship, which lay anchored in the middle of the river.     CHAPTER II.  Learning the Ropes.   As they came on board the receiving-ship they were all drawn up in a line, the roll was called, and they were divided off into messes. The mess to which Frank and his cousin belonged was called \"Number Twenty-five.\" As they were about to be dismissed, the officer who had called the roll said to Archie:  \"You will be cook of this mess.\"  \"Sir?\" said Archie, in surprise.  \"You will be cook of this mess,\" repeated the officer, in a louder tone. \"But what is the matter with you? Are you hard of hearing?\"  \"No, sir; but I can't cook.\"  \"Never mind; you can try. You may go below, lads.\"  The men did as they were ordered, and our heroes seated themselves on one of the broadside guns, and Archie said:  \"I'm in a nice fix, ain't I? I don't know any more about cooking than a hog does about gunpowder.\"  \"I will assist you all I can,\" said Frank; \"but I wonder what we shall have for dinner? I hope it will be something good, for I'm as hungry as a bear.\"  At this moment the whistle of the boatswain's mate sounded through the ship, and that personage passed them and called out, in a low voice:  \"Mess cook Number Twenty-five!\"  \"He means me, don't he?\" inquired Archie, turning to his cousin.  \"I don't know, I'm sure. Ask him.\"  \"Mess cook Number Twenty-five,\" again shouted the mate.  \"Here I am,\" said Archie.  \"Well, you ought to be somewhere else,\" said the mate, sharply. \"Why don't you go and draw your rations?\"  \"I don't know where I should go,\" answered Archie.  \"Then fly around and find out;\" and the mate turned on his heel and walked away.  \"Now, that's provoking,\" exclaimed Archie. \"Why couldn't he tell a fellow where to go? I'll tell that officer that I didn't ship for a cook; I shipped to fight. I wish I was at home again.\"  But regrets were worse than useless, and Archie began to look around to find some one who could tell him where to go to draw his rations. At length he met one of the men who belonged to his mess, whose name was Simpson, who told him that he must go to the paymaster's store-room, and offered to show him the way; and, as he saw that Archie was entirely unacquainted with life on shipboard, Simpson told him to come to him whenever he wanted any advice.  As Archie entered the store-room, the paymaster's steward, a boy about his own age, who was serving out the provisions, after inquiring the number of his mess, said:  \"It's lucky that you came in just as you did, for I have sent the master-at-arms after you. If you don't attend to your business better than this, I shall have you put on the black-list for a week or two.\"  Now, Archie had never been accustomed to being \"ordered about by any boy of his size,\" as he afterward remarked, and he felt very much like making an angry reply. But he knew it would only get him into trouble, and, choking down his wrath, he answered:  \"If any one will tell me what my duty is, I shall be glad to do it.\"  \"You haven't been in the navy a great while, have you?\" inquired the steward, with a laugh.  \"No; this is my first attempt at learning to be a sailor.\"  \"Well, all I have got to say,\" continued the steward, \"is, that you will soon be sorry that you ever made the attempt.\"  \"I am sorry now,\" said Archie; \"and if I ever get home again, you'll never catch me in another scrape like this. I don't like the idea of having everybody order me around, and talk to me as though I was a dog.\"  \"No reflections,\" said the steward sharply. \"Better keep a civil tongue in your head. But now to business. In the first place, here are your dishes,\" and he handed Archie a number of tin pots and plates, a large pan, and a mess-kettle.  \"What shall I do with these?\" asked Archie.  \"Why, eat out of them, to be sure,\" answered the steward; \"what else would you do with them? I shall hold you responsible for them,\" he continued; \"and if any of them are lost, they will be charged to your account. Now go and put them away in your mess-chest, which you will find on the berth-deck, and then come back, and I will give you your rations.\"  Archie accordingly picked up his dishes, and started--he knew not whither, for he had no idea to which part of the vessel he should go in order to find the berth-deck. But he had often boasted that he would have no difficulty in getting along in the world while he had a tongue in his head; so he made inquiries of the first man he met, who told him to go up to the captain, who was always ready to send the executive officer to show landlubbers over the ship. If there was any joke in this, Archie was too angry to notice it, and he was about to make a suitable rejoinder, when a voice close behind him said:  \"Now, shipmate, what's the use of being so hard on the boy?\"  Archie turned, and found Simpson at his side.  \"The youngster hain't been to sea as long as you and I have,\" continued the latter. \"If we were ashore, he would stand a better chance of gettin' along than you nor me.\"  \"Then, shiver his tim'ers, why didn't he stay ashore, where he belongs?\" asked the man, gruffly.  \"Oh, he's got the right stuff in him, and will soon learn the ropes,\" answered Simpson. \"Come, now, my little marlinspike,\" he continued, turning to Archie, \"follow in my wake, and I'll show you where our mess-chest is;\" and the kind-hearted sailor led the way to the berth-deck, and showed Archie the mess-chest, which had \"No. 25\" painted on it. Archie put all his dishes into it, with the exception of the mess-kettle and two plates, which, according to Simpson's directions, he took back to the store-room, to put his rations in. The steward then gave him a large piece of salt beef, some coffee, sugar, butter, and sea-biscuit.  \"Is this all we have to eat?\" inquired Archie, as he picked up his rations and followed Simpson back to his mess-chest.  \"All!\" repeated Simpson; \"yes, my hearty, and you may thank your lucky stars that you have got even this. You'll have to live on worse grub nor this afore your year is out. But I see you don't like the berth of cook, so I'll take it off your hands. Give me the key of the chist.\"  Archie accordingly handed it over, and then went in search of his cousin, whom he found perched upon a coil of rope, engaged in writing a letter.  \"Well,\" exclaimed the latter, as Archie came up, \"how do you get along?\"  \"I don't get along at all,\" said Archie; \"I tell you, we've got ourselves in a fix. What do you suppose we are going to have for dinner?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Frank. \"Well, we will have a chunk of salt beef, coffee without any milk, butter strong enough to go alone, and crackers so hard that you couldn't break them with an ax. I tell you, the navy is played out.\"  \"Well, it can't be helped,\" said his cousin. \"We are in for it. But we'll soon get accustomed to the food; we are seeing the worst of our year now.\"  \"I certainly hope so,\" said Archie; \"but I know I can stand it if any one else can; and when I fairly get started, I won't ask favors of any one.\"  Frank made no reply, but went on with his letter, and Archie leaned on one of the guns and gazed listlessly into the water. At length they were interrupted by the boatswain's whistle, blown three times in succession, long and loud.  \"What's the matter now, I wonder,\" said Frank, as the sailors commenced running about the ship in all directions.  \"I know,\" answered Archie, as he saw Simpson dive into the cook's galley and reappear bearing the mess-kettle, filled with steaming coffee, in one hand, and a large pan, containing the salt beef, in the other--\"dinner is ready.\"  The cousins walked aft to their mess-chest, and found the berth-deck filled with men, who were sitting around the chests, brandishing their sheath-knives over plates fall of salt beef and \"hard-tack.\"  Coming directly from home, where they had been accustomed to luxurious living, our young sailors thought they could not relish this hard fare but, as they had eaten no breakfast, they were very hungry, and the food tasted much better than they had expected.  When dinner was ended, Simpson began to gather up the dishes belonging to his mess, preparatory in washing them. Frank and Archie offered their assistance, and Simpson directed the former to take the mess-kettle and go up to the galley after some hot water. When he was returning, he saw a man stealing around the deck, holding something behind him that looked very much like a bundle of rope, and keeping a close watch on every one he met. Frank did not know what to make of this, and stepping up to the boatswain's mate, he inquired:  \"What is that man doing with that bundle of rope behind him?\"  \"That ain't a bundle of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#2)"],["body",", you landlubber,\" replied the mate; \"that's a swab.\"  \"Well, what is he doing with it?\"  \"The best way for you to learn would be for you to spill some of that water you have got in your kettle on the deck.\"  Frank, without stopping to think, tipped up his kettle, and turned out some of the water; and the man, who had been watching his every movement, sprang toward him and threw down the swab, exclaiming, \"I've caught you, my hearty; now you may log this bit of rope for awhile.\"  \"What do you mean?\" inquired Frank, amid a roar of laughter from every sailor who had witnessed the performance. \"What does he mean?\" repeated the mate; \"why, he means that you have got to wipe up that water you have spilt on deck, and carry that swab until you can catch some one else doing the same thing.\"  For the benefit of the uninitiated, we will make an explanation. It often happens on shipboard, especially receiving-ships, that the men become very careless; and in carrying water, paint, or grease about the ship, frequently spill some of it on deck. While this state of things continues, it is impossible to keep a ship clean, and, in order to break up this habit, the culprits are obliged to wipe up whatever they have spilled, and then carry a swab about the deck until they can detect some one else equally unfortunate. This is not a pleasant task; for, as soon as this rule is put in force, the men become very careful, and the luckless offender is sometimes obliged to walk the decks the entire day before he can detect any one in the act of violating it.  Frank, of course, did not understand this, and the mate had got him into the scrape for the purpose of getting the man who first had the swab, who was a particular friend of his, out of his unpleasant position.  \"Come, youngster, drop that mess-kettle and pick up that swab,\" commanded the mate.  Frank knew he had no alternative; so he set his mess-kettle on deck out of the way, and picking up the swab, walked aft to the place where he had left Simpson.  \"Hullo, there,\" exclaimed the latter, as Frank approached, \"what's the matter with you?\"  Frank related the whole circumstance, and Simpson could scarcely restrain his indignation.  \"That bo'son's mate ought to be mast-headed for a whole week,\" he exclaimed. \"But I'll square yards with him some day. I'm sorry you have got into this scrape, but it can't be helped. I've seen many a good fellow, in my time, in the same fix. Now you must walk around the ship, and if you see any one spill the least drop of water, or any thing else, on deck, rush up and give him the swab. There are a good many landlubbers on board, who don't know the rules, and you won't have any trouble in catching them. Always be careful to keep the swab behind you, out of sight.\"  Frank was a good deal mortified at being the victim of this novel mode of punishment; but he consoled himself with the thought that he would soon learn his duty, and be enabled to avoid all such scrapes. He walked about the vessel for an hour, trailing the swab along the deck behind him; but it seemed as though every one was particularly careful.  Meanwhile Archie, who had learned the particulars of the case from Simpson, was acting as a sort of scout, hoping to be of some assistance to his cousin. But he looked and waited in vain for some one to violate the rule, and finally he resolved to make use of a little strategy in releasing Frank.  Discovering a man coming out of the galley with a pail of water, Archie walked rapidly down the deck, and jostled him with sufficient force to empty half the contents of his pail on the deck. Archie did not, of course, stop to apologize, but hurried on, and before the man could look up to see who had caused the mischief, he had disappeared Frank, who had been watching his cousin's motions, immediately stepped up and dropped the swab before the man, and walked away, laughing in his sleeve, when he thought how cleverly his release had been accomplished.  When the hour of bedtime arrived, the boys were instructed how to get into their hammocks, and laughed at for tumbling out on the opposite side. But, after a few attempts, they succeeded in gaining the center of their suspended beds, and were soon in a sound sleep.     CHAPTER III.  Squaring the Yards.   By degrees the boys became accustomed to their new situation, and began to feel much more contented. The only thing that troubled them was the food they received. It consisted, for the most part, of salt pork and beef, and hard crackers, with now and then a little flour and dried apples. Simpson, who had been in the navy nearly all his life, and had become well acquainted with its rules and regulations, asserted that they did not receive half their allowance, and promised that, if he could detect the paymaster's steward in the act of cheating them, he would pay him back in his own coin. Now Blinks, for that was the steward's name, was a notorious cheat; he never gave the men their full rations. On the contrary, he often boasted that he cleared not less than a hundred pounds of provisions every day. He was the caterer of the steerage mess, and many a pound of flour and apples, which should have been given to the men, found its way to his table, in the shape of pies and puddings. Blinks always rose early, and as soon as he was dressed, the steerage steward, every morning, brought to his room a lunch, consisting of coffee and apple-pie. He was very fond of pies, and had several made every day. Every time the men passed the galley, they saw long rows of them set out to cool. Many a midnight plundering expedition had been planned against the galley, but without success. The door and windows were securely fastened at sundown, and all attempts to effect an entrance were unavailing. It was also useless to attempt to bribe the cook, for Blinks, who was a strict accountant, always knew how many pies were made every day, and if any of them were missing, the cook was sure to suffer. One evening, while Frank and Simpson were engaged in washing up the supper-dishes, the latter inquired:  \"Would you like one of those pies we saw in the galley to-day?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Frank; \"they looked very tempting.\"  \"Well,\" said Simpson, lowering his voice to a whisper, \"we'll have some of them to-night.\"  \"How will we get them?\" inquired Frank.  \"Why, we'll steal them. We can't beg or buy them. Besides, the stuff they are made of rightfully belongs to us. I don't care a snap for the pies, but I don't want to see that rascally steward growing fat off our grub.\"  \"I'm in for it,\" answered Frank, who had long wanted an opportunity to revenge himself on Blinks.  \"Will that cousin of yours lend us a hand?\" inquired Simpson.  \"Yes, without any coaxing. He does not like the steward any better than I do. But I'd like to know how we are going to work to get at the pies? The doors and windows are all fastened.\"  \"We will pry up the galley, so that one of us can crawl under it. I've put a handspike where I can find it in a moment. We shall have no trouble at all.\"  As soon as the dishes were washed and stowed away in the mess-chest, Frank went to find his cousin, who was always ready for any mischief of that kind, and readily agreed to the proposal. When bedtime came, the three slung their hammocks together, and, to all appearances, were soon fast asleep. At nine o'clock the ship's corporal put out all the berth-deck lights, which left the place shrouded in darkness. As soon as he had gone forward again, Simpson raised himself on his elbow, and whispered:  \"Turn out, lads. Now's our time.\"  The boys crept noiselessly out of their hammocks, and followed the sailor, who led the way directly to the galley, which was, in fact, a small house, about ten feet square, built on the deck, to which it was insecurely fastened. Simpson found his handspike without any difficulty, and placing one end of it under the galley, easily raised it from the deck, while Archie threw himself on his hands and knees, and crawled in under it. It was as dark as pitch inside the galley, but he knew exactly where the pies were kept, and had no difficulty in finding them. He handed three of them to his cousin, and then crawled out again, and the galley was lowered to its place. After stowing the pies safely away in their mess-chest, they again sought their hammocks. The next morning, when the steward entered the galley to prepare the usual lunch for Blinks, he was surprised, and a good deal terrified, to find that some of the pies were missing. He immediately went on deck, and reported it to Blinks, who furiously asked:  \"Where have they gone to, you rascal?\"  \"I don't know, sir, I'm sure,\" answered the steward, while visions of double-irons danced before his eyes. \"There were eight pies in the galley when I locked it up last night.\"  \"I don't believe it, you scoundrel. You sold the pies, and think that, by telling me they are missing, you can make me believe that they were stolen.\"  \"I have never done any thing of the kind since I have been your steward, Mr. Blinks,\" said the man, with some spirit. \"I have always been as careful of your interests as I would be of my own. Did you ever detect me in a mean or a dishonest act?\"  \"No; but I have often caught the cook stealing things. I'll report you to the executive officer, and have you punished. Go below.\"  The man sullenly withdrew, and Blinks hurried to the executive officer's room and reported the affair.  \"Are you sure the steward stole the pies, Mr. Blinks?\" inquired the officer; \"perhaps some one broke into the galley. It would be well for you to go down and see, before punishing the steward.\"  Blinks hurried below, and commenced a thorough examination of the locks and window-fastenings, but all to no purpose; and he was still more surprised when the steward affirmed that he had found all the doors and windows closed, just as he had left them. This was also reported to the executive officer, who advised Blinks to say"]]]
