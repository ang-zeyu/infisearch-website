Yes, I know that; but fear nothing, my friends; money for our enterprise will not be wanting, I answer for that.\"  \"It will be showered upon us,\" replied J.T. Maston.  \"Well, what do you say to aluminium?\" asked the president.  \"Adopted,\" answered the three members of the committee.  \"As to the form of the projectile,\" resumed Barbicane, \"it is of little consequence, since, once the atmosphere cleared, it will find itself in empty space; I therefore propose a round ball, which will turn on itself, if it so pleases.\"  Thus ended the first committee meeting. The question of the projectile was definitely resolved upon, and J.T. Maston was delighted with the idea of sending an aluminium bullet to the Selenites, \"as it will give them no end of an idea of the inhabitants of the earth!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  HISTORY OF THE CANNON.   The resolutions passed at this meeting produced a great effect outside. Some timid people grew alarmed at the idea of a projectile weighing 20,000 lbs. hurled into space. People asked what cannon could ever transmit an initial speed sufficient for such a mass. The report of the second meeting was destined to answer these questions victoriously.  The next evening the four members of the Gun Club sat down before fresh mountains of sandwiches and a veritable ocean of tea. The debate then began.  \"My dear colleagues,\" said Barbicane, \"we are going to occupy ourselves with the construction of the engine, its length, form, composition, and weight. It is probable that we shall have to give it gigantic dimensions, but, however great our difficulties might be, our industrial genius will easily overcome them. Will you please listen to me and spare objections for the present? I do not fear them.\"  An approving murmur greeted this declaration.  \"We must not forget,\" resumed Barbicane, \"to what point our yesterday's debate brought us; the problem is now the following: how to give an initial speed of 12,000 yards a second to a shot 108 inches in diameter weighing 20,000 lbs.  \"That is the problem indeed,\" answered Major Elphinstone.  \"When a projectile is hurled into space,\" resumed Barbicane, \"what happens? It is acted upon by three independent forces, the resistance of the medium, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with which it is animated. Let us examine these three forces. The resistance of the medium--that is to say, the resistance of the air--is of little importance. In fact, the terrestrial atmosphere is only forty miles deep. With a rapidity of 12,000 yards the projectile will cross that in five seconds, and this time will be short enough to make the resistance of the medium insignificant. Let us now pass to the attraction of the earth--that is to say, to the weight of the projectile. We know that that weight diminishes in an inverse ratio to the square of distances--in fact, this is what physics teach us: when a body left to itself falls on the surface of the earth, it falls 15 feet in the first second, and if the same body had to fall 257,542 miles--that is to say, the distance between the earth and the moon--its fall would be reduced to half a line in the first second. That is almost equivalent to immobility. The question is, therefore, how progressively to overcome this law of gravitation. How shall we do it? By the force of impulsion?\"  \"That is the difficulty,\" answered the major.  \"That is it indeed,\" replied the president. \"But we shall triumph over it, for this force of impulsion we want depends on the length of the engine and the quantity of powder employed, the one only being limited by the resistance of the other. Let us occupy ourselves, therefore, to-day with the dimensions to be given to the cannon. It is quite understood that we can make it, as large as we like, seeing it will not have to be moved.\"  \"All that is evident,\" replied the general.  \"Until now,\" said Barbicane, \"the longest cannon, our enormous Columbiads, have not been more than twenty-five feet long; we shall therefore astonish many people by the dimensions we shall have to adopt.\"  \"Certainly,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston. \"For my part, I ask for a cannon half a mile long at least!\"  \"Half a mile!\" cried the major and the general.  \"Yes, half a mile, and that will be half too short.\"  \"Come, Maston,\" answered Morgan, \"you exaggerate.\"  \"No, I do not,\" said the irate secretary; \"and I really do not know why you tax me with exaggeration.\"  \"Because you go too far.\"  \"You must know, sir,\" answered J.T. Maston, looking dignified, \"that an artilleryman is like a cannon-ball, he can never go too far.\"  The debate was getting personal, but the president interfered.  \"Be calm, my friends, and let us reason it out. We evidently want a gun of great range, as the length of the engine will increase the detention of gas accumulated behind the projectile, but it is useless to overstep certain limits.\"  \"Perfectly,\" said the major.  \"What are the usual rules in such a case? Ordinarily the length of a cannon is twenty or twenty-five times the diameter of the projectile, and it weighs 235 to 240 times its weight.\"  \"It is not enough,\" cried J.T. Maston with impetuosity.  \"I agree to that, my worthy friend, and in fact by keeping that proportion for a projectile nine feet wide, weighing 30,000 lbs., the engine would only have a length of 225 feet and a weight of 7,200,000 lbs.\"  \"That is ridiculous,\" resumed J.T. Maston. \"You might as well take a pistol.\"  \"I think so too,\" answered Barbicane; \"that is why I propose to quadruple that length, and to construct a cannon 900 feet long.\"  The general and the major made some objections, but, nevertheless, this proposition, strongly supported by the secretary, was definitely adopted.  \"Now,\" said Elphinstone, \"what thickness must we give its sides?\"  \"A thickness of six feet,\" answered Barbicane.  \"You do not think of raising such a mass upon a gun-carriage?\" asked the major.  \"That would be superb, however! said J.T. Maston.  \"But impracticable,\" answered Barbicane. \"No, I think of casting this engine in the ground itself, binding it up with wrought-iron hoops, and then surrounding it with a thick mass of stone and cement masonry. When it is cast it must be bored with great precision so as to prevent windage, so there will be no loss of gas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in the propulsion.\"  \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" said Maston, \"we have our cannon.\"  \"Not yet,\" answered Barbicane, calming his impatient friend with his hand.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because we have not discussed its form. Shall it be a cannon, howitzer, or a mortar?\"  \"A cannon,\" replied Morgan.  \"A howitzer,\" said the major.  \"A mortar,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.  A fresh discussion was pending, each taking the part of his favourite weapon, when the president stopped it short.  \"My friends,\" said he, \"I will soon make you agree. Our Columbiad will be a mixture of all three. It will be a cannon, because the powder-magazine will have the same diameter as the chamber. It will be a howitzer, because it will hurl an obus. Lastly, it will be a mortar, because it will be pointed at an angle of 90°, and that without any chance of recoil; unalterably fixed to the ground, it will communicate to the projectile all the power of impulsion accumulated in its body.\"  \"Adopted, adopted,\" answered the members of the committee.  \"One question,\" said Elphinstone, \"and will this _canobusomortar_ be rifled?\"  \"No,\" answered Barbicane. \"No, we must have an enormous initial speed, and you know very well that a shot leaves a rifle less rapidly than a smooth-bore.\"  \"True,\" answered the major.  \"Well, we have it this time,\" repeated J.T. Maston.  \"Not quite yet,\" replied the president.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because we do not yet know of what metal it will be made.\"  \"Let us decide that without delay.\"  \"I was going to propose it to you.\"  The four members of the committee each swallowed a dozen sandwiches, followed by a cup of tea, and the debate recommenced.  \"Our cannon,\" said Barbicane, \"must be possessed of great tenacity, great hardness; it must be infusible by heat, indissoluble, and inoxydable by the corrosive action of acids.\"  \"There is no doubt about that,\" answered the major, \"and as we shall have to employ a considerable quantity of metal we shall not have much choice.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Morgan, \"I propose for the fabrication of the Columbiad the best alloy hitherto known--that is to say, 100 parts of copper, 12 of tin, and 6 of brass.\"  \"My friends,\" answered the president, \"I agree that this composition has given excellent results; but in bulk it would be too dear and very hard to work. I therefore think we must adopt an excellent material, but cheap, such as cast-iron. Is not that your opinion, major?\"  \"Quite,\" answered Elphinstone.  \"In fact,\" resumed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12902"],["title","A Textbook of Theosophy (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders      A TEXTBOOK OF THEOSOPHY           by  C.W.

The Result of Theosophical Study  Index     Chapter I  WHAT THEOSOPHY IS   \"There is a school of philosophy still in existence of which modern culture has lost sight.\" In these words Mr. A.P. Sinnett began his book, _The Occult World_, the first popular exposition of Theosophy, published thirty years ago. [Namely in 1881.] During the years that have passed since then, many thousands have learned wisdom in that school, yet to the majority its teachings are still unknown, and they can give only the vaguest of replies to the query, \"What is Theosophy?\"  Two books already exist which answer that question: Mr. Sinnett's _Esoteric Buddhism_ and Dr. Besant's _The Ancient Wisdom_. I have no thought of entering into competition with those standard works; what I desire is to present a statement, as clear and simple as I can make it, which may be regarded as introductory to them.  We often speak of Theosophy as not in itself a religion, but the truth which lies behind all religions alike. That is so; yet, from another point of view, we may surely say that it is at once a philosophy, a religion and a science. It is a philosophy, because it puts plainly before us an explanation of the scheme of evolution of both the souls and the bodies contained in our solar system. It is a religion in so far as, having shown us the course of ordinary evolution, it also puts before us and advises a method of shortening that course, so that by conscious effort we may progress more directly towards the goal. It is a science, because it treats both these subjects as matters not of theological belief but of direct knowledge obtainable by study and investigation. It asserts that man has no need to trust to blind faith, because he has within him latent powers which, when aroused, enable him to see and examine for himself, and it proceeds to prove its case by showing how those powers may be awakened. It is itself a result of the awakening of such powers by men, for the teachings which it puts before us are founded upon direct observations made in the past, and rendered possible only by such development.  As a philosophy, it explains to us that the solar system is a carefully-ordered mechanism, a manifestation of a magnificent life, of which man is but a small part. Nevertheless, it takes up that small part which immediately concerns us, and treats it exhaustively under three heads--present, past and future.  It deals with the present by describing what man really is, as seen by means of developed faculties. It is customary to speak of man as having a soul. Theosophy, as the result of direct investigation, reverses that dictum, and states that man _is_ a soul, and _has_ a body--in fact several bodies, which are his vehicles and instruments in various worlds. These worlds are not separate in space; they are simultaneously present with us, here and now, and can be examined; they are the divisions of the material side of Nature--different degrees of density in the aggregation of matter, as will presently be explained in detail. Man has an existence in several of these, but is normally conscious only of the lowest, though sometimes in dreams and trances he has glimpses of some of the others. What is called death is the laying aside of the vehicle belonging to this lowest world, but the soul or real man in a higher world is no more changed or affected by this than the physical man is changed or affected when he removes his overcoat. All this is a matter, not of speculation, but of observation and experiment.  Theosophy has much to tell us of the past history of man--of how in the course of evolution he has come to be what he now is. This also is a matter of observation, because of the fact that there exists an indelible record of all that has taken place--a sort of memory of Nature--by examining which the scenes of earlier evolution may be made to pass before the eyes of the investigator as though they were happening at this moment. By thus studying the past we learn that man is divine in origin and that he has a long evolution behind him--a double evolution, that of the life or soul within, and that of the outer form. We learn, too, that the life of man as a soul is of, what to us seems, enormous length, and that what we have been in the habit of calling his life is in reality only one day of his real existence. He has already lived through many such days, and has many more of them yet before him; and if we wish to understand the real life and its object, we must consider it in relation not only to this one day of it, which begins with birth and ends with death, but also to the days which have gone before and those which are yet to come.  Of those that are yet to come there is also much to be said, and on this subject, too, a great deal of definite information is available. Such information is obtainable, first, from men who have already passed much further along the road of evolution than we, and have consequently direct experience of it; and, secondly, from inferences drawn from the obvious direction of the steps which we see to have been previously taken. The goal of this particular cycle is in sight, though still far above us but it would seem that, even when that has been attained, an infinity of progress still lies before everyone who is willing to undertake it.  One of the most striking advantages of Theosophy is that the light which it brings to us at once solves many of our problems, clears away many difficulties, accounts for the apparent injustices of life, and in all directions brings order out of seeming chaos. Thus, while some of its teaching is based upon the observation of forces whose direct working is somewhat beyond the ken of the ordinary man of the world, if the latter will accept it as a hypothesis he will very soon come to see that it must be a correct one, because it, and it alone, furnishes a coherent and reasonable explanation of the drama of life which is being played before him.  The existence of Perfected Men, and the possibility of coming into touch with Them and being taught by Them, are prominent among the great new truths which Theosophy brings to the western world. Another of them is the stupendous fact that the world is not drifting blindly into anarchy, but that its progress is under the control of a perfectly organized Hierarchy, so that final failure even for the tiniest of its units is of all impossibilities the most impossible. A glimpse of the working of that Hierarchy inevitably engenders the desire to co-operate with it, to serve under it, in however humble a capacity, and some time in the far-distant future to be worthy to join the outer fringes of its ranks.  This brings us to that aspect of Theosophy which we have called religious. Those who come to know and to understand these things are dissatisfied with the slow æons of evolution; they yearn to become more immediately useful, and so they demand and obtain knowledge of the shorter but steeper Path. There is no possibility of escaping the amount of work that has to be done. It is like carrying a load up a mountain; whether one carries it straight up a steep path or more gradually by a road of gentle slope, precisely the same number of foot-pounds must be exerted. Therefore to do the same work in a small fraction of the time means determined effort. It can be done, however, for it has been done; and those who have done it agree that it far more than repays the trouble. The limitations of the various vehicles are thereby gradually transcended, and the liberated man becomes an intelligent co-worker in the mighty plan for the evolution of all beings.  In its capacity as a religion, too, Theosophy gives its followers a rule of life, based not on alleged commands delivered at some remote period of the past, but on plain common sense as indicated by observed facts. The attitude of the student of Theosophy towards the rules which it prescribes resembles rather that which we adopt to hygienic regulations than obedience to religious commandments. We may say, if we wish, that this thing or that is in accordance with the divine Will, for the divine Will is expressed in what we know as the laws of Nature. Because that Will wisely ordereth all things, to infringe its laws means to disturb the smooth working of the scheme, to hold back for a moment that fragment or tiny part of evolution, and consequently to bring discomfort upon ourselves and others. It is for that reason that the wise man avoids infringing them--not to escape the imaginary wrath of some offended deity.  But if from a certain point of view we may think of Theosophy as a religion, we must note two great points of difference between it and what is ordinarily called religion in the West. First, it neither demands belief from its followers, nor does it even speak of belief in the sense in which that word is usually employed. The student of occult science either _knows_ a thing or suspends his judgment about it; there is no place in his scheme for blind faith. Naturally, beginners in the study cannot yet _know_ for themselves, so they are asked to read the results of the various observations and to deal with them as probable hypotheses--provisionally to accept and act upon them, until such time as they can prove them for themselves.  Secondly, Theosophy never endeavours to convert any man from whatever religion he already holds. On the contrary, it explains his religion to him, and enables him to see in it deeper meanings than he has ever known before. It teaches him to understand it and live it better than he did, and in many"]]]
