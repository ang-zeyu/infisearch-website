Aldrich, take the blob-stick.\"  One after another the men of the skeletonized platoon took their try with the blob-stick.  As is usual in the run of human affairs, some of the men made the thrust excellently, others indifferently, and some missed altogether.  \"Rest,\" ordered the lieutenant, presently, and the men stood at ease in the platoon line.  \"Some of you men do not get hold of this bayonet work as well as I could wish,\" Dick spoke up, all eyes turned on him.  \"The man who learns his bayonet work thoroughly has a reasonably good chance of coming back from Europe alive.  The man who learns it indifferently has very little chance of seeing his native land at the close of the war.  Remember that.  Bayonet fighting is one of the things no American soldier can afford to be dull about. Lieutenant Morris, if you will pick up a blob-stick we can show these men some of the value of swift work in the simpler thrusts and parries.\"  Each armed with a blob-stick, captain and second lieutenant faced each other.  Dick, scowling as though facing an enemy whom he hated, advanced upon his subordinate, making a swift, savage lunge aimed at the other's abdomen.  In a twinkling the thrust had been parried by Lieutenant Morris, who, at close quarters, aimed a vicious jab at his captain's wind-pipe.  That, too, was blocked. Warming up, the two officers fought without victory for a full three-quarters of a minute.  Then, at a word from Prescott, each drew back.  \"Every one of you men, by the time you reach France, should be able to fight faster and better than that,\" Dick announced.  Down the line an infectious smile ran.  It seemed to these soldiers impossible that a more skillful or a swifter bit of combat work could be put up than they had just witnessed.  \"You two men, at the right, bring your rifles here,\" Prescott ordered, and the bayoneted rifles were brought and handed to the two officers.  \"Now, Lieutenant Morris, the first four series, as fast as we can go through them,\" Dick commanded.  Bang!  bump!  flash!  Rifle barrels rang as they crossed; butts bumped hard against barrel or stock, and glittering steel flashed in the sunlight as the two infantry officers advanced and retreated in a savage, realistic contest.  It really seemed as though Lieutenant Morris and Captain Prescott were bent on annihilating each other. Could this fierce, mutual onslaught be pretense---play?  Then, as the last move of the fourth series was executed the two infantry officers jumped back a step each and dipped the points of their gleaming blades by way of courtesy.  The other three platoons of the company had stopped drill to watch.  How the thrilled men of A company wished to applaud and cheer!  \"Lieutenant Morris and I are very poor hands at bayonet work, compared with what we want you men to be when this regiment sails for France,\" Prescott remarked, smilingly, as he handed back the rifle to its owner.  From that platoon Prescott passed on to others in his company, offering a remark here and a word of instruction there.  \"You men must do everything to get your muscles up to concert pitch,\" Captain Prescott announced.  \"No lady-like thrusts will ever push a bayonet into a German's face.  A ton of weight is needed behind every bayonet thrust or jab!\"  An orderly approached, saluting.  \"Compliments of the commanding officer, sir, and he will see the captain in his office at regimental headquarters, sir.\"  Returning the salute Dick walked off the drill ground as though he had nothing on his mind.  Down the street he espied Greg, also going toward headquarters, and hurried after him.  On the other side of the street was Captain Cartwright, who soon crossed over to join them.  In silence, the three captains made their way along the street until they reached regimental headquarters.  It was a low one-story pine shed, with the colonel's office at one end, the adjutant's office next to it, and beyond that the rooms occupied by the sergeant major and his clerical force, and, last of all, the chaplain's office.  None of the three captains was exactly at ease as they entered the adjutant's office and reported.  \"The commanding officer will see you at once,\" said the adjutant. \"Pass through into his office.\"  Colonel Cleaves, glancing up from his desk, gravely returned the salutes of his three captains.  \"Be good enough to close the door into the adjutant's office, Captain Holmes,\" directed the K.O.  \"Now, gentlemen, I will hear whatever explanation you have to offer of a very remarkable scene that I came upon this noon.\"  All three waited, to see if one of the others wished to speak first.  After waiting a moment or two Colonel Cleaves asked:  \"Captain Prescott, it was you who struck the knock-down blow, was it not?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Dick answered promptly, \"though it followed a parry, and was more of a thrust than a blow.\"  \"You agree to that, Captain Cartwright?\" quizzed the K.O.  \"Essentially so, sir.\"  \"There had been a quarrel, had there not?\"  \"I made a reply to a remark by Captain Cartwright, sir,\" Greg supplied, \"which, he felt justified in construing as offensive, though I did not so intend it.  I was annoyed at what I felt to be an insinuation.  Then Captain Prescott came out of his quarters, sir, and caught Captain Cartwright's wrist.  When Captain Prescott released it, Captain Cartwright struck at him.  The blow was parried, and Captain Cartwright struck once more.  That blow was also parried, and Captain Cartwright went to the floor.\"  \"Do you concur in that, Captain Cartwright?\" asked the K.O.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"By the way, Captain Prescott,\" went on Colonel Cleaves, handing him a small piece of paper, \"can you account for this?\"  As Dick Prescott took the paper and glanced at it he felt himself turning almost dizzy in bewilderment.     CHAPTER IV  AS IT IS DONE IN THE ARMY   \"That is your handwriting, is it not, Captain Prescott?\" demanded the regimental commander.  \"It looks just like my handwriting, sir, but I'll swear that I never wrote it,\" declared astonished Dick, still staring at the little piece of paper.  \"Yet it resembles your handwriting?\"  \"Yes, sir.  If I didn't know positively that I didn't write any such message then I'd be about ready to admit that it is my handwriting. But I didn't write it, sir.\"  \"Pass it to Captain Holmes.  I will ask him if he has seen this note before.\"  \"No, sir,\" declared Greg, very positively, though he, too, was startled, for it was hard to persuade himself that he was not looking down at his chum's familiar handwriting.  The note read:  _\"Dear H.  Stick to what we agreed upon, and we can cook C's goose without trouble.  P.\"_  \"May I speak, sir?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes, Captain.\"  \"Then I desire to say, sir, that I have not the least desire to see Captain Cartwright in any trouble.  Hence, it would have been impossible for me to think of writing such a note.  More, sir, it would have been stupid of me to risk writing such a note, for Captain Holmes and I sat in my quarters until it was time for us to leave on our way to our respective company offices.\"  \"And while in your quarters did you discuss this affair of your trouble with Captain Cartwright?\"  \"To the best of my recollection, sir, we did not mention it,\" Dick declared.  \"Is that your recollection, Captain Holmes?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And this is not your handwriting, Captain Prescott?\"  \"I give you my word of honor, sir, that I did not write it, and did not even discuss the matter with Captain Holmes.\"  \"I do not understand this note in the least,\" Colonel Cleaves went on.  \"Of course, Captain Prescott, I am bound to accept your assurance that you did not write this.  I do not know how the note came here; all I know about it is that I found it on my desk, under a paper weight, about fifteen minutes ago, when I came in.\"  \"It is the work of some trouble-maker, sir,\" Greg ventured.  \"Do you know anything about this note, Captain Cartwright?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied that officer, flushing at the intimation that he could have had anything to do with it, for Greg had passed the paper to him.  \"I will keep that note, then,\" said Colonel Cleaves, taking it, \"in the hope that I may later find out how it came to be here. Captain Cartwright, do you deny that Captain Prescott did no more than to parry your blows and thrust you back off your balance?\"  \"That was all he did, sir.\"  \"And you made two distinct efforts to hit him?\"  \"Y-y-yes, sir.\"  \"Was anything said that, in your opinion, justified you in attempting to strike a brother officer?\"  \"At the time I thought Captain Holmes had justified my attempt to \\ strike him.\"  \"Do you still think so?\"  \"N-no, sir.  I was undoubtedly too impetuous.\"  \"And you attempted to strike Captain Prescott only because he tried to restrain you from striking a brother officer?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Is there anything more to be said or explained by any of you gentlemen?\"  \"Nothing, sir,\" came from three pairs of lips.  \"Then, since none of you wishes to prefer charges,\" pursued Colonel Cleaves, \"I will say that the whole affair, as far as it has been explained to me, looks like a childish quarrel to have taken place between officers and gentlemen.  On the statements made to me, I will say that I believe that Captain Cartwright was most to blame.  I therefore take this opportunity to rebuke him.  Captain Prescott, of course, you understand that I accept your assurance that you did not write the note I showed you.  Keep the peace after this, gentlemen, and make an honest effort to promote brotherliness of spirit with all the officers of the service, and especially of this regiment.  That is all.\"  Saluting, the three captains stepped out into the sunlight.  The sentry pacing on headquarters post swung his rifle from shoulder arms down to port arms, then came to present arms before the officers, who acknowledged his formal courtesy by bringing their hands up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12810"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys with Pershing's Troops (#6)"],["body","to the brims of their campaign hats.  \"Well, that's over!\" announced Cartwright, in a tone of relief.  \"And will never be repeated,\" said Greg.  \"But you will admit, Holmes, that you've picked a good deal on me, from time to time,\" Cartwright pressed, in a half-aggrieved tone.  \"I will admit, for you both,\" smiled Dick, \"that you're in danger of starting something all over again unless you shut up and make a fresh, better start.  So we won't refer to personal matters again, but we come to your company's barracks first, Cartwright, and when we get there we will shake hands and agree to remember that we're all engaged in a fierce effort to make the Ninety-ninth the best American regiment.\"  In silence the three pursued their way to C company's building. Here they halted.  \"To the Ninety-ninth, best of 'em all,\" proposed Prescott, holding out his hand to Cartwright, who took and pressed it.  \"To the best officers' crowd in the service,\" quoth Greg.  \"Amen to that!\" assented Cartwright, though he strode away with a dull red flush burning on either cheek.  Half an hour later Dick's business took him past the regiment's guard-house.  As carpenters were everywhere busy in camp putting up more necessary buildings the place officially known as the guard-house was more of a bullpen.  Posts had been driven deeply in the form of a rectangle, and on these barbed wire had been laid to a height of nine feet.  Within the rectangle guard-house prisoners could take the air, retiring to either of two tents inside the enclosure whenever they wished.  As he passed Dick noted, vaguely, that four or five men stood by the nearer line of barbed wire fence.  He held up his left hand to glance at his wrist watch.  Just as he turned the hand, to let it fall at his side, something dropped out of the air, falling squarely in his hand.  Instinctively Prescott's fingers closed over the missile.  He glanced, quickly, at the enclosure, but not one of the men on the other side of the wire was looking his way.  Then the young captain, keeping briskly on his way, opened his hand to glance down at his unexpected catch.  It was a piece of manila paper, wrapped around a stone.  Waiting only until he was some distance from the bull-pen, Dick unwrapped the paper.  In printed characters, used undoubtedly to disguise handwriting, was this message:  \"Watch for all you're worth the carpenter who talks with Mock!\"  \"Now, why on earth should I interest myself in the affairs of Greg's busted sergeant?\" Dick wondered.  \"And what possible interest can I have in any carpenter unless he's a friend of mine, or has business with me?\"  On the whole Prescott felt that he was lowering his own dignity to attach any importance to an anonymous message, plainly from a guardhouse prisoner.  Yet he dropped the small stone and thrust the scrap of paper into a pocket for future consideration should he deem it worth while.     CHAPTER V  THE CAMP CARPENTER'S TALE   After a week of exacting office work and all but endless drill, Dick had the rare good fortune to find himself with an evening of leisure.  \"Going to be busy to-night?\" Dick asked Greg at the evening meal at mess.  \"Confound it, yes,\" returned Captain Holmes.  \"I must put in the time until midnight with Sergeant Lund going over clothing requisitions for my new draft of men.\"  \"My requisitions are all in, and I expect the clothing supplies to-morrow morning,\" Dick continued.  \"That is because you got your draft of new men two days earlier than I did,\" grumbled Greg.  \"You're always the lucky one.  But what are you going to do to-night that you want company?\"  \"I thought I'd like to take a walk in the moonlight,\" Dick responded.  \"Great Scott!  Do you mean to tell me you don't get enough walk in the daytime in the broiling sunlight?\"  \"Not the same kind of walking,\" Prescott smiled.  \"I want to stroll to-night and talk.  But if I must go alone, then I shall have to think.\"  \"Don't attempt hard work after hours,\" advised Holmes.  \"Such as walking?\"  \"No; thinking.\"  Dick finished his meal and stepped outside in the air.  The first to join him was Lieutenant Morris.  \"Feel like taking a walk in the moonlight?\" Dick asked.  \"I'd be delighted, Captain, but to-night I'm officer in charge at the company barracks.\"  \"True; I had forgotten.\"  Other officers Dick invited to join him, but all had duty of one kind or another, or else home letters to write.  \"Did I hear you say you were going to take a walk, Prescott?\" asked Major Wells.  \"Yes, sir.  By any great good luck are you willing to go with me?\"  \"I'd like to, Prescott, but as it happens there is the school for battalion commanders to-night.  A talk on trench orders by the brigadier is listed, I believe.\"  \"I'm afraid I shall have to go alone,\" sighed Dick \"Yet I've half a mind to stroll over to company office and invent some new paper work.  With every one else busy I feel like the only slacker in the regiment.\"  \"If you really go alone,\" suggested the major, \"perhaps you could combine pleasure with doing me a favor.\"  \"How, sir?\"  \"My horse hasn't had any exercise for three days.  I'd be glad if you'd take him out tonight, if it suits you.\"  \"Nothing could please me better, sir,\" Dick cried eagerly, for he dearly loved a horse.  \"How soon will you be ready?\"  \"At once, Major.\"  \"Then I'll send around now for the horse.\"  Just a few minutes later an orderly rode up, dismounted, saluted and turned the saddled animal over to A company's commander.  \"This is luck, indeed!\" Dick told himself, as he felt the horse's flanks between his knees and moved off at a slow canter.  \"I wonder why I never tried to transfer into the cavalry.\"  While waiting for the horse he had telephoned the adjutant, stating that for the next three hours he would be either in camp or in the near vicinity.  After being halted by three outlying sentries Prescott rode clear of the camp bounds, riding at a trot down a moonlit country road. Vinton was the nearest town, where soldiers on a few hours' pass went for their recreation out of camp.  The road to Vinton was usually well sprinkled with jitney busses conveying soldiers to or from camp, so Prescott had chosen another road which, at night, was likely to be almost free of traffic of any kind.  \"As this is the first evening I've had off in three weeks I don't believe I need feel that I'm loafing,\" Dick reflected.  \"It's gorgeous outdoors to-night.  There will undoubtedly be plenty of moonlight in France, but there won't be many opportunities like this one.\"  Finding that his horse was sweating, Dick slowed the animal down to a walk.  He had ridden along another mile when, near a farmhouse he espied a soldier in the road, strolling with a young woman.  As the horse gained upon the young couple the soldier glanced backward, then swung the girl to the side of the road and halted beside her, drawing himself up to attention and saluting smartly. The man was Private Lawrence of his own company.  \"Good evening,\" Dick nodded, pleasantly.  \"Good evening, sir,\" replied the private.  Dick didn't ask, as some officers would have done, whether the soldier had pass to be out of camp.  He could ascertain that on his return to camp.  Instead, he said:  \"You must have this road pretty nearly to yourself, Lawrence, as far as soldiers go.\"  \"There's at least one other, sir,\" the soldier replied, in a matter of fact way.  \"I saw one slip by in the field, close to the road. I won't be sure, but I think it was Private Mock, sir.\"  \"He has friends down this way?\" Dick asked casually.  \"Not that I ever heard of, sir.  There aren't many houses on this road.  My friend, Miss Williams, lives in the house up yonder.\"  At the implied introduction Prescott raised his campaign hat, then rode on.  The instant that Mock's name had been mentioned it had flashed through Dick's mind that, when in Greg's office that afternoon, he had seen Mock's name on Top Sergeant Lund's list of men for pass, and Greg, he knew, had drawn a pen line through that name.  \"Of course it may not have been Mock that Lawrence saw; Lawrence himself wasn't sure,\" Dick reflected.  \"Yet, if Mock is out of camp to-night he is out without leave.  Private Lawrence didn't realize that, or he wouldn't tell tales.\"  Soon the horse began to move along an up grade road between two lines of trees.  Finding that the animal, instead of drying off, was sweating more freely, Dick drew rein and dismounted.  \"It's hard work on a hot night, so you and I will walk together for a while, old pal,\" Dick confided to the borrowed mount.  \"There, you find it easier, don't you?\"  As if to express gratitude the horse bent its head forward, rubbing against Dick's shoulder.  \"Who says horses can't talk plainly, hey, old fellow?\" Dick demanded. On together they walked, until Prescott felt himself perspiring, while the horse's coat grew dry.  \"There, now, friend,\" said Dick, running a hand over the creature's flanks, \"you're cool and dry, and this is one of the prettiest spots in Georgia, so I reckon I'll tie you and rest until I, too, am dry again.\"  Having tied the horse by the bridle reins, Dick strolled about, enjoying the dark and quiet after the bright electric lights and the bustle of camp.  Presently he strolled down the road until he came to a break in the trees on his right.  Though the moon had gone partly behind a cloud Dick found himself gazing down a clearing.  He would not have been interested, had it not been that he caught sight of the unmistakable silhouette of a soldier, and, beside him, a somewhat stoop-shouldered man in darker garb.  \"Why, I wonder if that can be Mock, and his carpenter?\" reflected Prescott, recalling the note that had dropped so mysteriously into his extended palm.  Screened behind a bush Dick watched the pair until he saw them coming toward the road.  Then Prescott drew back, finding better shelter, but he did not seek complete concealment.  It occurred to him to wait there, in silence, and see if "]]]
