With this eloquent burst he exhorts the accurst--   “Go forth in the desert and perish in woe,   The sins of the people are whiter than snow!”    Then signs to his pal for to let the brute go.    The animal, freed from all restraint   Lowered his head, made a kind of a feint,   And charged straight at that elderly saint.   So fierce his attack, and so very severe, it   Quite floored the Rabbi, who, ere he could fly,   Was rammed on the--no, not the back--but just near it.   The scapegoat he snorted, and wildly cavorted,   A light-hearted antelope “out on the ramp”,   Then stopped, looked around, got the “lay of the ground”,   And made a bee-line back again to the camp.   The elderly priest, as he noticed the beast   So gallantly making his way to the East,   Says he:  “From the tents may I never more roam again   If that there old billy-goat ain't going home again.   He's hurrying, too!  This never will do.   Can't somebody stop him?  I'm all of a stew.   After all our confessions, so openly granted,   He's taking our sins back to where they're not wanted.   We've come all this distance salvation to win agog,   If he takes home our sins--it'll burst up the Synagogue!”    He turned to an Acolyte making his bacca light,   A fleet-footed youth who could run like a crack o' light.   “Run, Abraham, run!  Hunt him over the plain,   And drive back the brute to the desert again.   The Sphinx is a-watching, the Pyramids frown on you,   From those granite tops forty cent'ries look down on you--   Run, Abraham, run!  I'll bet half-a-crown on you.”    So Abraham ran; like a man did he go for him,   But the goat made it clear each time he drew near   That he had what the racing men call “too much toe” for him.    The crowd with great eagerness studied the race--   “Great Scott! isn't Abraham forcing the pace--   And don't the goat spiel?  It is hard to keep sight on him,   The sins of the Israelites ride mighty light on him.   The scapegoat is leading a furlong or more,   And Abraham's tiring--I'll lay six to four!   He rolls in his stride; he's done, there's no question!”    But here the old Rabbi brought up a suggestion.   ['Twas strange that in racing he showed so much cunning),   “It's a hard race,” said he, “and I think it would be   A good thing for someone to take up the running.”    As soon said as done, they started to run--   The priests and the deacons, strong runners and weak 'uns   All reckoned ere long to come up with the brute,   And so the whole boiling set off in pursuit.   And then it came out, as the rabble and rout   Streamed over the desert with many a shout--   The Rabbi so elderly, grave, and patrician,   Had been in his hot youth a bold metallician,   And offered, in gasps, as they merrily spieled,   “Any price Abraham!  Evens the field!”    Alas! the whole clan, they raced and they ran,   And Abraham proved him an “even-time” man,   But the goat, now a speck they could scarce keep their eyes on,   Stretched out in his stride in a style most surprisin'   And vanished ere long o'er the distant horizon.    Away in the camp the bill-sticker's tramp   Is heard as he wanders with paste, brush, and notices,   And paling and wall he plasters them all,   “I wonder how's things gettin' on with the goat,” he says,   Then pulls out his bills, “Use Solomon's Pills”:   “Great Stoning of Christians!  To all devout Jews! you all   Must each bring a stone--Great sport will be shown;   Enormous Attractions!  And prices as usual!   Roll up to the Hall!!  Wives, children, and all,   For naught the most delicate feelings to hurt is meant!”    Here his eyes opened wide, for close by his side   Was the scapegoat devouring the latest advertisement!   One shriek from him burst--“You creature accurst!”    And he ran from the spot like one fearing the worst.   His language was chaste, as he fled in his haste,   But the goat stayed behind him--and “scoffed up” the paste.    With downcast head, and sorrowful tread,   The people came back from the desert in dread.   “The goat--was he back there?  Had anyone heard of him?”    In very short order they got plenty word of him,   In fact as they wandered by street, lane and hall,   “The trail of the serpent was over them all.”    A poor little child knocked out stiff in the gutter   Proclaimed that the scapegoat was bred for a “butter”.   The billsticker's pail told a sorrowful tale,   The scapegoat had licked it as dry as a nail;   He raced through their houses, and frightened their spouses,   But his latest achievement most anger arouses,   For while they were searching, and scratching their craniums,   One little Ben Ourbed, who looked in the flower-bed,   Discovered him, eating the Rabbi's geraniums.                 Moral:    The moral is patent to all the beholders--   Don't shift your own sins on to other folk's shoulders;   Be kind to dumb creatures and never abuse them,   Nor curse them nor kick them, nor spitefully use them;   Take their lives if needs must--when it comes to the worst,   But don't let them perish of hunger or thirst.   Remember, no matter how far you may roam,   That dogs, goats, and chickens, it's simply the dickens   Their talent stupendous for “getting back home”.   Your sins, without doubt, will aye find you out,   And so will a scapegoat, he's bound to achieve it--   But, die in the wilderness?  Don't you believe it!     An Evening in Dandaloo      It was while we held our races--   Hurdles, sprints and steeplechases--    Up in Dandaloo,   That a crowd of Sydney stealers,   Jockeys, pugilists and spielers   Brought some horses, real heelers,    Came and put us through.    Beat our nags and won our money,   Made the game by no means funny,    Made us rather blue;   When the racing was concluded,   Of our hard-earned coin denuded   Dandaloonies sat and brooded    There in Dandaloo.         .    .    .    .    .    Night came down on Johnson's shanty   Where the grog was no means scanty,    And a tumult grew   Till some wild, excited person   Galloped down the township cursing,   “Sydney push have mobbed Macpherson,    Roll up, Dandaloo!”    Great St. Denis! what commotion!   Like the rush of stormy ocean    Fiery horsemen flew.   Dust and smoke and din and rattle,   Down the street they spurred their cattle   To the war-cry of the battle,    “Wade in, Dandaloo!”    So the boys might have their fight out,   Johnson blew the bar-room light out,    Then, in haste, withdrew.   And in darkness and in doubting   Raged the conflict and the shouting,   “Give the Sydney push a clouting,    Go it, Dandaloo!”    Jack Macpherson seized a bucket,   Every head he saw he struck it--    Struck in earnest, too;   And a man from Lower Wattle,   Whom a shearer tried to throttle,   Hit out freely with a bottle,    There in Dandaloo.    Skin and hair were flying thickly,   When a light was fetched, and quickly    Brought a fact to view--   On the scene of the diversion   Every single, solid person   Come along to help Macpherson--    _All_ were Dandaloo!”    When the list of slain was tabled,   Some were drunk and some disabled,    Still we found it true.   In the darkness and the smother   We'd been belting one another;   Jack Macpherson bashed his brother    There in Dandaloo.    So we drank, and all departed--   How the “mobbing” yarn was started    No one ever knew--   And the stockmen tell the story   Of that conflict fierce and gory,   How we fought for love and glory    Up in Dandaloo.    It's a proverb now, or near it--   At the races you can hear it,    At the dog-fights, too!   Every shrieking, dancing drover   As the canines topple over   Yells applause to Grip or Rover,    “Give him 'Dandaloo'!”    And the teamster slowly toiling   Through the deep black country, soiling    Wheels and axles, too,   Lays the whip on Spot and Banker,   Rouses Tarboy with a flanker--   “Redman!  Ginger!  Heave there!  Yank her!    Wade in, Dandaloo!”     A Ballad of Ducks      The railway rattled and roared and swung   With jolting carriage and bumping trucks.   The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung   In the Western sky:  and the tireless tongue   Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told   This terrible tale of the days of old,   And the party that ought to have kept the ducks.    “Well, it ain't all joy bein' on the land   With an overdraft that'd knock you flat;   And the rabbits have pretty well took command;   But the hardest thing for a man to stand   Is the feller who says 'Well, I told you so!   You should ha' done this way, don't you know!'--   I could lay a bait for a man like that.    “The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one   And what they leave--well, it ain't 'de luxe'.   But a growlin' fault-findin' son of a gun   Who'd lent some money to stock our run--   I said they'd eaten what grass we had--   Says he, 'Your management's very bad,   You had a right to have kept some ducks!'    “To have kept some ducks!

Wherever you went you had to tread   On grasshoppers guzzlin' day and night;   And when with a swoosh they rose in flight,   If you didn't look out for yourself they'd fly   Like bullets into your open eye   And knock it out of the back of your head.    “There isn't a turkey or goose or swan,   Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks,   Can make a difference on a run   When a grasshopper plague has once begun;   'If you'd finance us,' I says, 'I'd buy   Ten thousand emus and have a try;   The job,' I says, 'is too big for ducks!    “'You must fetch a duck when you come to stay;   A great big duck--a Muscovy toff--   Ready and fit,' I says, 'for the fray;   And if the grasshoppers come our way   You turn your duck into the lucerne patch,   And I'd be ready to make a match   That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off!'    “He came to visit us by and by,   And it just so happened one day in Spring   A kind of a cloud came over the sky--   A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high,   And nine miles thick,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],["title","True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#0)"],["body","them and all they had, 'twas lightly come and lightly go; and     when we left them my master said to me: \"This is thy first lesson,     but to-night we shall be at Hamburgh.

TRUE STORIES OF CRIME FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  BY ARTHUR TRAIN  FORMERLY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEW YORK COUNTY  1908     PREFACE   The narratives composing this book are literally true stories of crime. In a majority of the cases the author conducted the prosecutions himself, and therefore may claim to have a personal knowledge of that whereof he speaks. While no confidence has been abused, no essential facts have been omitted, distorted, or colored, and the accounts themselves, being all matters of public record, may be easily verified.  The scenes recorded here are not literature but history, and the characters who figure in them are not puppets of the imagination, but men and women who lived and schemed, laughed, sinned and suffered, and paid the price when the time came, most of them, without flinching. A few of those who read these pages may profit perhaps by their example; others may gain somewhat in their knowledge of life and human nature; but all will agree that there are books in the running brooks, even if the streams be turbid, and sermons in stones, though these be the hearts of men. If in some instances the narratives savor in treatment more of fiction than of fact, the writer must plead guilty to having fallen under the spell of the romance of his subject, and he proffers the excuse that, whereas such tales have lost nothing in accuracy, they may have gained in the truth of their final impression.

Having selected one to his fancy and arranged for some alterations, he produced from his wallet a check for $280, drawn to the order of George B. Lang, and signed E. Bierstadt, and remarked to the attentive salesman:  \"I haven't got quite enough cash with me to pay for these, but I have been intending to cash this check all the afternoon. Of course, you don't know me or even that my name is Lang, but if you will forward the check to the bank they will certify it, and to-morrow I will send for the suit and the balance of the money.\"  \"Certainly, Mr. Lang,\" replied the salesman. \"I will hold the suit and the money to await your orders.\"  The customer thanked him and took his departure. The check was sent to the bank, the bank certified it, then cancelled its certification and returned the check to Rogers, Peet & Company, and the store detectives, having communicated with Police Headquarters, anxiously awaited the arrival of Mr. Lang's messenger.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Envelope on the back of which Parker's forged order was written.]  Their efforts were rewarded a couple of days later by the appearance at the store of a lad who presented a written order (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) inscribed upon the back of an envelope bearing a cancelled stamp and addressed to Geo. B. Lang, No. 13 West Twenty-sixth Street, New York City, which read as follows:      ROGERS, PEET & Co.      Please give to bearer the clothes I purchased on     Tuesday--suit--pants--S. coat, and also kindly put change in     envelope in inside coat pocket.  Trusting the alterations are     satisfactory, and thanking you in advance for the favor and for past     courtesies, I am,      Resp. yours,      GEO. B. LANG.  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Parker's order on Rogers, Peet & Company, in the name of Lang.]  The boy was immediately placed under arrest, and after proclaiming his own innocence and vociferating that he was only doing an errand for a \"gent,\" who was waiting close by, was directed to return with his bundle as if nothing had occurred. This he did, and Mr. George B. Lang was soon in the clutches of the law.  Interrogated by his captors, the supposed Lang admitted that his real name was James Parker, that he lived at 110 West Thirty-eighth Street, and only requested that his wife be immediately notified of what had happened. At Headquarters the prisoner was identified as a gentleman who had been very actively engaged during the preceding months in passing bad checks throughout the city, his more recent operations having consisted in cashing a check on the Lincoln National Bank for $160 on July 20th, one for $290 on the same bank on July 30th, still another for $510.50 on August 4th, and one for $440.50 on the National Shoe and Leather Bank, \"to bearer,\" on August 8th. This last, in some inexplicable way, had been cashed at the very bank itself.  Believing that the forger had at last been caught, the precinct detectives later on, during the evening of Parker's arrest, visited no West Thirty-eighth Street, and on inquiring for \"Mrs. Parker,\" were introduced to a young girl of attractive appearance to whom they delivered their unwelcome message. Mrs. Parker seemed overwhelmed at the news and strongly asserted her confidence in her husband's innocence of any wrong-doing. Having performed their errand the officers departed.  A certain ineradicable jealousy has always existed between the plain-clothes men of the various precincts and the sleuths attached to the Central Office, and in this instance the precinct men, having gained the credit for the arrest, it did not occur to them as necessary to communicate the knowledge of their acquaintance with Mrs. Parker to Detective Sergeants Peabody and Clark, originally assigned at Headquarters to investigate the case.  It seemed, however, to Peabody very unlikely that Parker had conducted his operations alone, and he therefore at once inquired at the Tombs what character of visitors came to see the prisoner. The gateman replied that as yet none had arrived. At that very instant a young girl stepped to the wicket and asked if she could be allowed to see Mr. James Parker. It took the detective but a moment to run across to the Criminal Courts Building and to telephone the warden to detain her temporarily and then to refuse her request. Five minutes later the girl emerged disconsolately from the Tombs and boarded a car going uptown. Peabody followed her to 110 West Thirty-eighth Street, not for an instant supposing that the girl herself could be the forger, but believing that possibly through her he might learn of other members of the gang and secure additional evidence against Parker himself.  Of course, no intelligent person to-day supposes that, outside of Sir Conan Doyle's interesting novels, detectives seek the baffling criminal by means of analyzing cigar butts, magnifying thumb marks or specializing in the various perfumes in favor among the fair sex, or by any of those complicated, brain fatiguing processes of ratiocination indulged in by our old friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There are still, however, genuine detectives, and some of them are to be found upon the New York police force. The magnifying glass is not one of the ordinary tools of the professional sleuth, and if he carries a pistol at all it is because the police rules require it, while those cases may be numbered upon the fingers of two hands where his own hair and whiskers are not entirely sufficient for his purposes in the course of his professional career.  The next morning Peabody donned the most disreputable suit in his wardrobe, neglected his ordinary visit to the barber, and called at 110 West Thirty-eighth Street, being, of course, at this time entirely unaware of the fact that the girl was Parker's wife. He found her sitting in a rocking chair in a comfortable, well-furnished room, and reading a magazine. Assuming an expression of sheepish inanity he informed her that he was an old pal of \"Jim's\" who had been so unfortunate as to be locked up in the same cell with him at Headquarters, and that the latter was in desperate need of morphine. That Parker was an habitual user of the drug could be easily seen from the most casual inspection, but that it would prove an open sesame to the girl's confidence was, as the detective afterward testified, \"a hundred-to-one shot.\"  \"Poor Jim!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Couldn't you smuggle some into the Tombs for him?\"  Peabody took the hint. Of course he"]]]
