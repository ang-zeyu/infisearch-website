Fain would I say, “Forgive my foul offence,”       Fain promise never more to disobey;      But, should my Author health again dispense,      Again I might desert fair virtue's way;      Again in folly's part might go astray;      Again exalt the brute and sink the man;      Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray      Who act so counter heavenly mercy's plan?      Who sin so oft have mourn'd, yet to temptation ran?       O Thou, great Governor of all below!      If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee,      Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow,      Or still the tumult of the raging sea:      With that controlling pow'r assist ev'n me,      Those headlong furious passions to confine,      For all unfit I feel my pow'rs to be,      To rule their torrent in th' allowed line;      O, aid me with Thy help, Omnipotence Divine!       1782     Fickle Fortune: A Fragment       Though fickle Fortune has deceived me,      She pormis'd fair and perform'd but ill;      Of mistress, friends, and wealth bereav'd me,      Yet I bear a heart shall support me still.       I'll act with prudence as far 's I'm able,      But if success I must never find,      Then come misfortune, I bid thee welcome,      I'll meet thee with an undaunted mind.     Raging Fortune--Fragment Of Song       O raging Fortune's withering blast      Has laid my leaf full low, O!      O raging Fortune's withering blast      Has laid my leaf full low, O!       My stem was fair, my bud was green,      My blossom sweet did blow, O!      The dew fell fresh, the sun rose mild,      And made my branches grow, O!       But luckless Fortune's northern storms      Laid a' my blossoms low, O!      But luckless Fortune's northern storms      Laid a' my blossoms low, O!     Impromptu--“I'll Go And Be A Sodger”       O why the deuce should I repine,      And be an ill foreboder?      I'm twenty-three, and five feet nine,      I'll go and be a sodger!       I gat some gear wi' mickle care,      I held it weel thegither;      But now it's gane, and something mair--      I'll go and be a sodger!     Song--“No Churchman Am I”       Tune--“Prepare, my dear Brethren, to the tavern let's fly.”        No churchman am I for to rail and to write,      No statesman nor soldier to plot or to fight,      No sly man of business contriving a snare,      For a big-belly'd bottle's the whole of my care.       The peer I don't envy, I give him his bow;      I scorn not the peasant, though ever so low;      But a club of good fellows, like those that are here,      And a bottle like this, are my glory and care.       Here passes the squire on his brother--his horse;      There centum per centum, the cit with his purse;      But see you the Crown how it waves in the air?      There a big-belly'd bottle still eases my care.       The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die;      for sweet consolation to church I did fly;      I found that old Solomon proved it fair,      That a big-belly'd bottle's a cure for all care.       I once was persuaded a venture to make;      A letter inform'd me that all was to wreck;      But the pursy old landlord just waddl'd upstairs,      With a glorious bottle that ended my cares.       “Life's cares they are comforts”--a maxim laid down      By the Bard, what d'ye call him, that wore the black gown;      And faith I agree with th' old prig to a hair,      For a big-belly'd bottle's a heav'n of a care.     A Stanza Added In A Mason Lodge       Then fill up a bumper and make it o'erflow,      And honours masonic prepare for to throw;      May ev'ry true Brother of the Compass and Square      Have a big-belly'd bottle when harass'd with care.     My Father Was A Farmer       Tune--“The weaver and his shuttle, O.”        My father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O,      And carefully he bred me in decency and order, O;      He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing, O;      For without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O.       Then out into the world my course I did determine, O;      Tho' to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O;      My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O:      Resolv'd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O.       In many a way, and vain essay, I courted Fortune's favour, O;      Some cause unseen still stept between, to frustrate each endeavour, O;      Sometimes by foes I was o'erpower'd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O;      And when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O.       Then sore harass'd and tir'd at last, with Fortune's vain delusion, O,      I dropt my schemes, like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O;      The past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O;      But the present hour was in my pow'r, and so I would enjoy it, O.       No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O;      So I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O;      To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O;      For one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O.       Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro' life I'm doom'd to wander, O,      Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O:      No view nor care, but shun whate'er might breed me pain or sorrow, O;      I live to-day as well's I may, regardless of to-morrow, O.       But cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O,      Tho' Fortune's frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O:      I make indeed my daily bread, but ne'er can make it farther, O:      But as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O.       When sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O,      Some unforeseen misfortune comes gen'rally upon me, O;      Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnatur'd folly, O:      But come what will, I've sworn it still, I'll ne'er be melancholy, O.       All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O,      The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O:      Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O,      A cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O.     John Barleycorn: A Ballad       There was three kings into the east,      Three kings both great and high,      And they hae sworn a solemn oath      John Barleycorn should die.       They took a plough and plough'd him down,      Put clods upon his head,      And they hae sworn a solemn oath      John Barleycorn was dead.       But the cheerful Spring came kindly on,      And show'rs began to fall;      John Barleycorn got up again,      And sore surpris'd them all.       The sultry suns of Summer came,      And he grew thick and strong;      His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,      That no one should him wrong.       The sober Autumn enter'd mild,      When he grew wan and pale;      His bending joints and drooping head      Show'd he began to fail.       His colour sicken'd more and more,      He faded into age;      And then his enemies began      To show their deadly rage.       They've taen a weapon, long and sharp,      And cut him by the knee;      Then tied him fast upon a cart,      Like a rogue for forgerie.       They laid him down upon his back,      And cudgell'd him full sore;      They hung him up before the storm,      And turned him o'er and o'er.       They filled up a darksome pit      With water to the brim;      They heaved in John Barleycorn,      There let him sink or swim.       They laid him out upon the floor,      To work him farther woe;      And still, as signs of life appear'd,      They toss'd him to and fro.       They wasted, o'er a scorching flame,      The marrow of his bones;      But a miller us'd him worst of all,      For he crush'd him between two stones.       And they hae taen his very heart's blood,      And drank it round and round;      And still the more and more they drank,      Their joy did more abound.       John Barleycorn was a hero bold,      Of noble enterprise;      For if you do but taste his blood,      'Twill make your courage rise.       'Twill make a man forget his woe;      'Twill heighten all his joy;      'Twill make the widow's heart to sing,      Tho' the tear were in her eye.       Then let us toast John Barleycorn,      Each man a glass in hand;      And may his great posterity      Ne'er fail in old Scotland!       1783     Death And Dying Words Of Poor Mailie, The Author's Only Pet Yowe., The  An Unco Mournfu' Tale       As Mailie, an' her lambs thegither,      Was ae day nibbling on the tether,      Upon her cloot she coost a hitch,      An' owre she warsl'd in the ditch:      There, groaning, dying, she did lie,      When Hughoc he cam doytin by.

It's no the loss o' warl's gear,      That could sae bitter draw the tear,      Or mak our bardie, dowie, wear      The mourning weed:      He's lost a friend an' neebor dear      In Mailie dead.

Song--The Rigs O' Barley       Tune--“Corn Rigs are bonie.”        It was upon a Lammas night,      When corn rigs are bonie,      Beneath the moon's unclouded light,      I held awa to Annie;      The time flew by, wi' tentless heed,      Till, 'tween the late and early,      Wi' sma' persuasion she agreed      To see me thro' the barley.       Corn rigs, an' barley rigs,      An' corn rigs are bonie:      I'll ne'er forget that happy night,      Amang the rigs wi' Annie.       The sky was blue, the wind was still,      The moon was shining clearly;      I set her down, wi' right good will,      Amang the rigs o' barley:      I ken't her heart was a' my ain;      I lov'd her most sincerely;       I kiss'd her owre and owre again,      Amang the rigs o' barley.      Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &c.       I lock'd her in my fond embrace;      Her heart was beating rarely:      My blessings on that happy place,      Amang the rigs o' barley!      But by the moon and stars so bright,      That shone that hour so clearly!      She aye shall bless that happy night      Amang the rigs o' barley.      Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &c.       I hae been blythe wi' comrades dear;      I hae been merry drinking;      I hae been joyfu' gath'rin gear;      I hae been happy thinking:      But a' the pleasures e'er I saw,      Tho' three times doubl'd fairly,      That happy night was worth them a',      Amang the rigs o' barley.      Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &c.     Song Composed In August       Tune--“I had a horse, I had nae mair.”        Now westlin winds and slaught'ring guns      Bring Autumn's pleasant weather;      The moorcock springs on whirring wings      Amang the blooming heather:      Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain,      Delights the weary farmer;      And the moon shines bright, when I rove at night,      To muse upon my charmer.       The partridge loves the fruitful fells,      The plover loves the mountains;      The woodcock haunts the lonely dells,      The soaring hern the fountains:      Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves,      The path of man to shun it;      The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush,      The spreading thorn the linnet.       Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find,      The savage and the tender;      Some social join, and leagues combine,      Some solitary wander:      Avaunt, away! the cruel sway,      Tyrannic man's dominion;      The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry,      The flutt'ring, gory pinion!       But, Peggy dear, the ev'ning's clear,      Thick flies the skimming swallow,      The sky is blue, the fields in view,      All fading-green and yellow:      Come let us stray our gladsome way,      And view the charms of Nature;      The rustling corn, the fruited thorn,      And ev'ry happy creature.       We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk,      Till the silent moon shine clearly;      I'll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest,      Swear how I love thee dearly:      Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs,      Not Autumn to the farmer,      So dear can be as thou to me,      My fair, my lovely charmer!     Song       Tune--“My Nanie, O.”        Behind yon hills where Lugar flows,      'Mang moors an' mosses many, O,      The wintry sun the day has clos'd,      And I'll awa to Nanie, O.

A country lad is my degree,      An' few there be that ken me, O;      But what care I how few they be,      I'm welcome aye to Nanie, O.       My riches a's my penny-fee,      An' I maun guide it cannie, O;      But warl's gear ne'er troubles me,      My thoughts are a' my Nanie, O.       Our auld guidman delights to view      His sheep an' kye thrive bonie, O;      But I'm as blythe that hands his pleugh,      An' has nae care but Nanie, O.       Come weel, come woe, I care na by;      I'll tak what Heav'n will sen' me, O:      Nae ither care in life have I,      But live, an' love my Nanie, O.     Song--Green Grow The Rashes       A Fragment       Chor.--Green grow the rashes, O;      Green grow the rashes, O;      The sweetest hours that e'er I spend,      Are spent amang the lasses, O.       There's nought but care on ev'ry han',      In ev'ry hour that passes, O:      What signifies the life o' man,      An' 'twere na for the lasses, O.      Green grow, &c.       The war'ly race may riches chase,      An' riches still may fly them, O;      An' tho' at last they catch them fast,      Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O.      Green grow, &c.       But gie me a cannie hour at e'en,      My arms about my dearie, O;      An' war'ly cares, an' war'ly men,      May a' gae tapsalteerie, O!      Green grow, &c.       For you sae douce, ye sneer at this;      Ye're nought but senseless asses, O:      The wisest man the warl' e'er saw,      He dearly lov'd the lasses, O.      Green grow, &c.       Auld Nature swears, the lovely dears      Her noblest work she classes, O:      Her prentice han' she try'd on man,      An' then she made the lasses, O.      Green grow, &c.     Song--Wha Is That At My Bower-Door       Tune--“Lass, an I come near thee.”        “Wha is that at my bower-door?”       “O wha is it but Findlay!”       “Then gae your gate, ye'se nae be here:”       “Indeed maun I,” quo' Findlay;      “What mak' ye, sae like a thief?”       “O come and see,” quo' Findlay;      “Before the morn ye'll work mischief:”       “Indeed will I,” quo' Findlay.       “Gif I rise and let you in”--      “Let me in,” quo' Findlay;      “Ye'll keep me waukin wi' your din;”       “Indeed will I,” quo' Findlay;      “In my bower if ye should stay”--      “Let me stay,” quo' Findlay;      “I fear ye'll bide till break o' day;”       “Indeed will I,” quo' Findlay.       “Here this night if ye remain”--      “I'll remain,” quo' Findlay;      “I dread ye'll learn the gate again;”       “Indeed will I,” quo' Findlay.      “What may pass within this bower”--      “Let it pass,” quo' Findlay;      “Ye maun conceal till your last hour:”       “Indeed will I,” quo' Findlay.       1784     Remorse: A Fragment       Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace,      That press the soul, or wring the mind with anguish      Beyond comparison the worst are those      By our own folly, or our guilt brought on:      In ev'ry other circumstance, the mind      Has this to say, “It was no deed of mine:”       But, when to all the evil of misfortune      This sting is added, “Blame thy foolish self!”"]]]
