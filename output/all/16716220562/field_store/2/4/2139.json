It gave me a queer feeling to see a grown-up man indulging in the tactics of a spoiled child, but I have heard many people express the opinion, in which I now heartily agree, that the Germans are a childish sort of people. They are stupidly boastful, inordinately fond of adulation and attention, and peevish and sulky when they cannot have their own way. I tried to imagine how a young German boy would have been treated by one of our doctors, and laughed to myself at the absurdity of the thought that they would make faces at him!  The young bugler was examined before I was, and as he was marched out of the room, the doctor who had made the faces grabbed at his kilt with an insulting gesture, at which the lad attempted to kick him. The doctor dodged the kick, and the Germans who were in the room roared with laughter. I hated them more that minute than I had up to that time.  The Belgian attendants who looked after the bathing of us were kind and polite. One of them could speak a little English, and he tried hard to get information regarding his country from us.  \"Is it well?\" he asked us eagerly. \"My country--is it well?\"  We thought of the shell-scarred country, with its piles of smouldering ashes, its pallid women with their haunted faces, the deathlike silence of the ruined streets. We thought of these things, but we didn't tell him of them. We told him the war was going on in great shape: the Allies were advancing all along the line, and were going to be in Berlin by Christmas. It was worth the effort to see his little pinched face brighten. He fairly danced at his work after that, and when I saw him afterwards, he eagerly asked--\"My country--is it well?\" I do not know why he thought I knew, or maybe he didn't think so. But, anyway, I did my best. I gave him a glowing account of the Allied successes, and painted a gloomy future for the Kaiser, and I again had my reward, in his glowing face.  Everything we had was taken from us except shoes, socks, cap, and handkerchief, and we did not see them again: neither did we get another bath, although I was six weeks in the hospital.  The hospital clothes consisted of a pajama suit of much-faded flannelette, but I was glad to get into it, and doubly glad to get rid of my shirt and tunic, which were stiff on one side with dried blood. From the lazaret, where I had my bath, I could see the gun platform with its machine guns, commanding every part of the Giessen Prison. The guard pointed it out to me, to quiet my nerves, I suppose, and to scare me out of any thought of insubordination. However, he need not have worried--I was not thinking of escaping just then or starting an insurrection either. I was quite content to lie down on the hard straw bed and pull the quilt over me and take a good long rest.    CHAPTER IV  THE LAZARET   The lazaret in which I was put was called \"M.G.K.,\" which is to say Machine Gun Company, and it was exactly like the other hospital huts. There were some empty beds, and the doctor seemed to have plenty of time to attend to us. For a few days, before my appetite began to make itself felt, I enjoyed the rest and quiet, and slept most of the time. But at the end of a week I began to get restless.  The Frenchman whose bed was next to mine fascinated me with his piercing black eyes, unnaturally bright and glittering. I knew the look in his eyes; I had seen it--after the battle--when the wounded were coming in, and looked at us as they were carried by on stretchers. Some had this look--some hadn't. Those who had it never came back.  And sometimes before the fighting, when the boys were writing home, the farewell letter that would not be mailed unless--\"something happened\"--I've seen that look in their faces, and I knew... just as they did... the letter would be mailed!  Emile, the Frenchman, had the look!  He was young, and had been strong and handsome, although his face was now thin and pinched and bloodless, like a slum child's; but he hung on to life pitifully. He hated to die--I knew that by the way he fought for breath, and raged when he knew for sure that it was going from him.  In the middle of his raging, he would lean over his bed and peer into my face, crying \"L'Anglaise--l'Anglaise,\" with his black eyes snapping like dagger points. I often had to turn away and put my pillow over my eyes.  But one afternoon, in the middle of it, the great silence fell on him, and Emile's struggles were over.          *       *       *  Our days were all the same. Nobody came to see us; we had no books. There was a newspaper which was brought to us every two weeks, printed in English, but published in German, with all the German fine disregard for the truth. It said it was \"printed for Americans in Europe.\" The name of it was \"The Continental Times,\" but I never heard it called anything but \"The Continental Liar.\" Still, it was print, and we read it; I remember some of the sentences. It spoke of an uneasy feeling in England \"which the presence of turbaned Hindoos and Canadian cowboys has failed to dispel.\" Another one said, \"The Turks are operating the Suez Canal in the interests of neutral shipping.\" \"Fleet-footed Canadians\" was an expression frequently used, and the insinuation was that the Canadians often owed their liberty to their speed.  But we managed to make good use of this paper. I got one of the attendants, Ivan, a good-natured, flat-footed Russian, to bring me a pair of scissors, and the boy in the cot next to mine had a stub of pencil, and between us we made a deck of cards out of the white spaces of the paper, and then we played solitaire, time about, on our quilts.          *       *       *  I got my first parcel about the end of May, from a Mrs. Andrews whose son I knew in Trail and who had entertained me while I was in London. I had sent a card to her as soon as I was taken. The box was like a visit from Santa Claus. I remember the \"Digestive Biscuits,\" and how good they tasted after being for a month on the horrible diet of acorn coffee, black bread, and the soup which no word that is fit for publication could describe.  I also received a card from my sister, Mrs. Meredith, of Edmonton, about this time. I was listed \"Missing\" on April 29th, and she sent a card addressed to me with \"Canadian Prisoner of War, Germany,\" on it, on the chance that I was a prisoner. We were allowed to write a card once a week and two letters a month; and we paid for these. My people in Canada heard from me on June 9th.          *       *       *  I cannot complain of the treatment I received in the lazaret. The doctor took a professional interest in me, and one day brought in two other doctors, and proudly exhibited how well I could move my arm. However, I still think if he had massaged my upper arm, it would be of more use to me now than it is.  Chloroform was not used in this hospital; at least I never saw any of it. One young Englishman, who had a bullet in his thigh, cried out in pain when the surgeon was probing for it. The German doctor sarcastically remarked, \"Oh, I thought the English were _brave_.\"  To which the young fellow, lifting his tortured face, proudly answered, \"The English _are_ brave--and _merciful_--and they use chloroform for painful operations, and do this for the German prisoners, too.\"  But there was no chloroform used for him, though the operation was a horrible one.  There was another young English boy named Jellis, who came in after the fight of May 8th, who seemed to be in great pain the first few days. Then suddenly he became quiet, and we hoped his pain had lessened; but we soon found out he had lock-jaw, and in a few days he died.          *       *       *  From the pasteboard box in which my first parcel came, I made a checker-board, and my next-door neighbor and I had many a game.  In about three weeks I was allowed to go out in the afternoons, and I walked all I could in the narrow space, to try to get back all my strength, for one great hope sustained me--I would make a dash for liberty the first chance I got, and I knew that the better I felt, the better my chances would be. I still had my compass, and I guarded it carefully. Everything of this nature was supposed to be taken from us at the lazaret, but I managed, through the carelessness of the guard, to retain the compass.  The little corral in which we were allowed to walk had a barbed-wire fence around it--a good one, too, eight strands, and close together. One side of the corral was a high wall, and in the enclosure on the other side of the wall were the lung patients.  One afternoon I saw a young Canadian boy looking wistfully through the gate, and I went over and spoke to him. He was the only one who could speak English among the \"lungers.\" The others were Russians, French, and Belgians. The boy was dying of loneliness as well as consumption. He came from Ontario, though I forget the name of the town.  \"Do you think it will be over soon?\" he asked me eagerly. \"Gee, I'm sick of it--and wish I could get home. Last night I dreamed about going home. I walked right in on them--dirt and all--with this tattered old tunic--and a dirty face. Say, it didn't matter--my mother just grabbed me--and it was dinner-time--they were eating turkey--a great big gobbler, all brown--and steaming hot--and I sat down in my old place--it was ready for me--and just began on a leg of turkey...\"  A spasm of coughing seized him, and he held to the bars of the gate until it passed.  Then he went on: \"Gee, it was great--it was all so clear. I can't believe that I am not going! I think the war must be nearly over--\"  Then the cough came again--that horrible, strangling cough--and I knew that it would be only in his dreams that he would ever see his home! For to him, at least, the war was nearly over, and the day of peace at hand.

I knew him the minute he came in the door, and was ready for him when he passed my bed.  He stopped and looked at me, and made some insulting remark about my beard, which was, I suppose, quite a sight, after a month of uninterrupted growth. Then he began to make faces at me.  I raised myself on my elbow, and regarded him with the icy composure of an English butler. Scorn and contempt were in my glance, as much as I could put in; for I realized that it was hard for me to look dignified and imposing, in a hospital pajama suit of dirt-colored flannelette, with long wisps of amber-colored hair falling around my face, and a thick red beard long enough now to curl back like a drake's tail.  I knew I looked like a valentine, but my stony British stare did the trick in spite of all handicaps, and he turned abruptly and went out.  The first week of June, I was considered able to go back to the regular prison-camp. A German guard came for me, and I stepped out in my pajamas to the outer room where our uniforms were kept. There were many uniforms there--smelling of the disinfectants--with the owners' names on them, but mine was missing. The guard tried to make me take one which was far too short for me, but I refused. I knew I looked bad enough, without having elbow sleeves and short pants; and it began to look as if I should have to go to bed until some good-sized patient came in.  But my guard suddenly remembered something, and went into another hut, bringing back the uniform of \"D. Smith, Vancouver.\" The name was written on the band of the trousers. D. Smith had died the day before, from lung trouble. The uniform had been disinfected, and hung in wrinkles. My face had the hospital pallor, and, with my long hair and beard, I know I looked \"snaggy\" like a potato that has been forgotten in a dark corner of the cellar.  When we came out of the lazaret, the few people we met on the road to the prison-camp broke into broad grins; some even turned and looked after us.    CHAPTER V  THE PRISON-CAMP   The guard took me to Camp 6, Barrack A, where I found some of the boys I knew. They were in good spirits, and had fared in the matter of food much the same as I had. We agreed exactly in our diagnosis of the soup.  I was shown my mattress and given two blankets; also a metal bowl, knife, and fork.  Outside the hut, on the shady side, I went and sat down with some of the boys who, like myself, were excused from labor. Dent, of Toronto, was one of the party, and he was engaged in the occupation known as \"reading his shirt\"--and on account of the number of shirts being limited to one for each man, while the \"reading\" was going on, he sat in a boxer's uniform, wrapped only in deep thought.  Now, it happened that I did not acquire any \"cooties\" while I was in the army, and of course in the lazaret we were kept clean, so this was my first close acquaintanceship with them. My time of exemption was over, though, for by night I had them a-plenty.  I soon found out that insect powder was no good. I think it just made them sneeze, and annoyed them a little. We washed our solitary shirts regularly, but as we had only cold water, it did not kill the eggs, and when we hung the shirt out in the sun, the eggs came out in full strength, young, hearty, and hungry. It was a new generation we had to deal with, and they had all the objectionable qualities of their ancestors, and a few of their own.  Before long, the Canadian Red Cross parcels began to come, and I got another shirt--a good one, too, only the sleeves were too long. I carefully put in a tuck, for they came well over my hands. But I soon found that these tucks became a regular rendezvous for the \"cooties,\" and I had to let them out. The Red Cross parcels also contained towels, toothbrushes, socks, and soap, and all these were very useful.  After a few weeks, with the lice increasing every day, we raised such a row about them that the guards took us to the fumigator. This was a building of three rooms, which stood by itself in the compound. In the first room we undressed and hung all our clothes, and our blankets too, on huge hooks which were placed on a sliding framework. This framework was then pushed into the oven and the clothes were thoroughly baked. We did not let our boots, belts, or braces go, as the heat would spoil the leather. We then walked out into the next room and had a shower bath, and after that went into the third room at the other side of the oven, and waited until the framework was pushed through to us, when we took our clothes from the hooks and dressed.  This was a sure cure for the \"cooties,\" and for a few days, at least, we enjoyed perfect freedom from them. Every week after this we had a bath, and it was compulsory, too.  [Illustration: Giessen Prison-Camp]  As prison-camps go, Giessen is a good one. The place is well drained; the water is excellent; the sanitary conditions are good, too; the sleeping accommodations are ample, there being no upper berths such as exist in all the other camps I have seen. It is the \"Show-Camp,\" to which visitors are brought, who then, not having had to eat the food, write newspaper articles telling how well Germany treats her prisoners. If these people could see some of the other camps that I have seen, the articles would have to be modified.          *       *       *  News of the trouble in Ireland sifted through to us in the prison-camp. The first I heard of it was a letter in the \"Continental Times,\" by Roger Casement's sister, who had been in Germany and had visited some of the prison-camps, and was so pleased with the generous treatment Germany was according her prisoners. She was especially charmed with the soup!!! And the letter went on to tell of the Irish Brigade that was being formed in Germany to fight the tyrant England. Every Irish prisoner who would join was to be given the privilege of fighting against England. Some British prisoners who came from Limburg, a camp about thirty miles from Giessen, told us more about it. Roger Casement, himself, had gone there to gather recruits, and several Irishmen had joined and were given special privileges accordingly. However, there were many Irishmen who did _not_ join, and who kept a list of the recruits--for future reference, when the war was over!  The Irishmen in our camp were approached, but they remained loyal.          *       *       *  The routine of the camp was as follows: Reveille sounded at six. We got up and dressed and were given a bowl of coffee. Those who were wise saved their issue of bread from the night before, and ate it with the coffee. There was a roll-call right after the coffee, when every one was given a chance to volunteer for work. At noon there was soup, and another roll-call. We answered the roll-call, either with the French word \"Présent\" or the German word \"Hier,\" pronounced the same as our word. Then at five o'clock there was an issue of black bread made mostly from potato flour.  I was given a light job of keeping the space between A Barrack and B Barrack clean, and I made a fine pretense of being busy, for it let me out of \"drill,\" which I detested, for they gave the commands in German, and it went hard with us to have to salute their officers.  On Sundays there was a special roll-call, when every one had to give a full account of himself. The prisoners then had the privilege of asking for any work they wanted, and if the Germans could supply it, it was given.  None of us were keen on working; not but what we would much rather work than be idle, but for the uncomfortable thought that we were helping the enemy. There were iron-works near by, where Todd, Whittaker, Dent, little Joe, and some others were working, and it happened that one day Todd and one of the others, when going to have teeth pulled at the dentist's, saw shells being shipped away, and upon inquiry found the steel came from the iron mines where they were working. When this became known, the boys refused to work! Every sort of bullying was tried on them for two days at the mines, but they still refused. They were then sent back to Giessen and sentenced to eighteen months' punishment at Butzbach--all but Dent, who managed some way to fool the doctor pretending he was sick!  That they fared badly there, I found out afterwards, though I never saw any of them.  Some of the boys from our hut worked on the railroad, and some went to work in the chemical works at Griesheim, which have since been destroyed by bombs dropped by British airmen.  John Keith, who was working on the railroad,--one of the best-natured and inoffensive boys in our hut,--came in one night with his face badly swollen and bruised. He had laughed, it seemed, at something which struck him as being funny, and the guard had beaten him over the head with the butt of his rifle. One of our guards, a fine old, brown-eyed man called \"Sank,\" told the guard who had done this what he thought of him. \"Sank\" was the \"other\" kind of German, and did all he could to make our lives pleasant. I knew that \"Sank\" was calling down the guard, by his expression and his gestures, and his frequent use of the word \"blödsinnig.\"  Another time one of the fellows from our hut, who was a member of a working party, was shot through the legs by the guard, who claimed he was trying to escape, and after that there were no more working parties allowed for a while.  Each company had its own interpreter, Russian, French, or English. Our interpreter was a man named Scott from British Columbia, an Englishman who had received part of his education at Heidelberg. From him I learned a good deal about the country through which I hoped to travel. Heidelberg is situated between Giessen and the Swiss boundary, and so was of special interest to me. I made a good-sized map, and marked in all the information I could dig out of Scott."]]]
