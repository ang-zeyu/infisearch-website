Again Colonel Edwards expressed his thanks, in which the others joined, and then he led the way toward the distant tents.  Fifteen minutes later the four friends were sleeping soundly, with never a care in the world, for it had been long since they had closed their eyes and they were completely worn out.  Darkness shrouded the small tent when Hal opened his eyes. It was several moments before the lad could gain his bearings, but when at last he realized just where he was he bethought himself of the others.  \"Still sleeping, I guess,\" he said.  He arose, moved to the door of the tent and passed out. A steady rumbling sound fell upon his ears and Hal, momentarily, was unable to account for it. But the solution soon came to him.  \"Troops moving,\" he told himself.  He was right. Walking some distance from the tent, he made out, probably half a mile away, the dark forms of many men as they marched swiftly on in the darkness, their figures lighted up ever and anon by the gleam of a flashlight. But the camp in which the lad stood was perfectly quiet.  \"Now I wonder--\" he muttered--gazed silently ahead a moment and then turned back toward the tent, saying to himself: \"Guess I'll wake the others up.\"  Chester and Colonel Anderson were aroused without much trouble. Not so Stubbs.  \"What's the matter?\" came the little man's query, when Hal prodded him gently in the ribs with his foot.  \"Time to get up,\" said Hal, briefly.  For a moment Stubbs opened his eyes and peered into the darkness--for Hal had made no light.  \"Get up?\" he exclaimed. \"What! Anthony Stubbs get up in the middle of the night? Not much!\"  \"But we are going, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"We don't want to leave you here by yourself.\"  \"Kind of you,\" said Stubbs sarcastically. \"I can remember when you were not so solicitious of my welfare. Don't worry about me. I'll just sleep right along.\"  He turned over and a loud snore a few moments later told that he was again in the land of dreams.  Again Hal prodded him with his foot.  \"Stubbs! I say, Stubbs!\" he called.  Directly Stubbs opened his eyes.  \"And what's the matter this time?\" he demanded aggrievedly.  \"Hurry!\" Hal exclaimed, thinking to get the little man up by a ruse. \"The Austrians are coming.\"  \"Run, then!\" replied Stubbs. \"I'll hide here. They won't bother me.\"  \"Now listen here, Stubs,\" said Chester, \"just when do you want to get up?\"  Again Stubbs allowed his eyes to open and he peered into the darkness sleepily.  \"What day is this?\" he inquired mildly.  \"Tuesday,\" replied Chester; \"but what--\"  \"Then call me Saturday,\" said the little man gently, and closed his eyes in sleep once more.  \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed Colonel Anderson. \"He had you there, Chester.\"  Chester appeared somewhat flustered.  \"Well, he'll have to get up out of there,\" he said wrathfully.  \"Oh, come on and let him be, Chester,\" said Hal. \"I guess nothing will hurt him. We'll be back by daylight and I'll venture to say we will find him here, still snoring.\"  \"Well, all right,\" Chester agreed at length; \"but to tell you the truth, I don't just like that answer he gave me.\"  The three left the tent and Hal led the way toward where he had so recently perceived the passing troops.  Infantry, cavalry and artillery were still passing in dense masses, moving westward.  \"I wonder where they are going?\" said Chester.  \"To the front, I suppose,\" replied Hal.  \"Now do you really suppose they are?\" asked Chester sarcastically. \"I thought perhaps they were on dress parade. Say, just where are we anyhow? Do either of you know?\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Colonel Anderson. \"I meant to ask Edwards, but I forgot all about it. He told us, you remember, he would be in the tent on our left. We'll go back and have him out. Perhaps we can learn a few things.\"  \"Suits me,\" Hal agreed. \"We can't see anything here but troops, and we have seen too many of them to be much interested. Come on.\"  Fifteen minutes later found them seated in the tent Colonel Edwards had commandeered for his temporary headquarters and the colonel himself doing the talking.  \"You are perhaps fifteen miles northwest of Cettinje, the capital of Montenegro,\" he explained.  \"And where are these troops going?\" asked Hal.  \"Reinforcements to the Austrian front,\" said Colonel Edwards. \"Also some of them, can they be spared, will be rushed to the aid of the Serbians, who, from all accounts, are being sorely pressed by the new German offensive.\"  \"New German offensive?\" exclaimed Hal.  \"Why, yes. Haven't you heard of it?\"  \"No. Will you explain?\"  \"I'll try,\" said Colonel Edwards. \"I'll revert back to the start. On Friday, August 13, news reached London, where I was then stationed, that an Austro-German army of more than 300,000 men was massing at a point on the Serbian frontier and it was asserted that the Kaiser was about to strike a blow at Serbia in order to improve Teuton prospects in the Balkans, where Roumania and Greece had been reported as waiting a favorable opportunity to join the Allies.  \"The great German victories in Russia, following the fall of Warsaw, had, however, caused the Balkan kingdoms to waver, and Bulgaria was said to have strong pro-German leanings. On August 16 the Austro-German army crossed the frontier and began a bombardment of Belgrade, the capital. This led to a crisis in the Greek parliament, where the Venizelos party caused the downfall of the cabinet, which supported the king's attitude of strict neutrality--a neutrality he had promised his consort, who is the sister of the Kaiser, as you know.  \"On August 21 Serbia made it known that in accordance with the advice of the Allies, she was willing to grant the demands of Bulgaria for the return of territory taken in the last Balkan war, and for a time it seemed that Bulgaria would enter the war on the side of the Allies. However, on September 19 it was said that Bulgaria would join the Central Powers, thus permitting Germany to establish an unbroken line of allies from the Baltic to the Bosporus.  \"On October 5, the Allies, upon invitation of the Greek premier, began the disembarkation of troops at Saloniki to go to the assistance of the Serbians; and, so far as I know, they are still landing.\"  The three friends had listened attentively to this account of the Balkan situation. They had heard some inkling of the seriousness of the Serbian plight, but had not realized until now that Germany had at last set out to crush the little Balkan kingdom as she had crushed Belgium in the early days of the great war.  \"And what is the latest on the Bulgarian attitude?\" asked Colonel Anderson.  \"Well, I haven't heard anything later than I have told you, but my personal opinion is that Bulgaria, sooner or later, will join the Germans.\"  \"Fools,\" said Colonel Anderson, briefly.  \"And Greece?\" inquired Chester.  \"I don't know, but I believe Greece will keep out of the war just as long as she possibly can. Certainly, the Greek people will never consent to aiding the Germans.\"  \"You never can tell,\" said Colonel Anderson sententiously.  Outside the tent it was now growing light, for time had passed swiftly. Hal noticed the light filtering in.  \"Great Scott! I had no idea it was morning,\" he said. \"It must have been after midnight when we awoke. Let's get outside.\"  They left the tent and Hal went into their own quarters a moment, where he found Stubbs up and about to emerge. Together the five walked toward the eastern extremity of the camp.  Came a sudden blaring of trumpets and a body of horse swept toward them. The riders drew rein almost before the friends, dismounted and stood at attention, while a figure who had been in the center also jumped to the ground. This figure of huge stature, a man of advanced age, who dismounted nimbly in spite of his years, walked toward the spot where stood the five friends. Edwards came to attention, as did the others.  \"The king!\" said Colonel Edwards in a low voice.     CHAPTER IV.  INTO THE MOUNTAINS.   Nicholas, king of the Montenegrins, came forward slowly, his head bowed as though in grief, and it seemed for a moment as though he would pass Hal, Chester and the others without seeing them. But even as he drew abreast of the five, he looked up suddenly. His gaze rested upon Colonel Edwards and the Englishman bowed low. Colonel Anderson did likewise. Hal, Chester and Stubbs remained erect.  The king smiled slightly at Colonel Edwards, whom he plainly knew, and glanced inquiringly at the others.  Colonel Edwards approached him.  \"Your majesty,\" he said, \"I would crave your permission to present another of my countrymen and three Americans, who have seen service with your allies in the western theater of war.\"  The king nodded his head affirmatively and Colonel Edwards motioned the others to approach. The king extended a hand to each and spoke a few pleasant words.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"that you will make yourselves perfectly at home in my camp. I am sorry I have no better to offer you.\" He turned to Edwards. \"I have faith in you English,\" he said, \"and for that reason I was about to summon you this morning. I have a mission of importance, and some danger, I would have you undertake.\"  \"I shall be pleased, sire\" replied Colonel Edwards with a bow.  The king smiled.  \"I knew you would be,\" he said. \"Now this mission will necessitate probably more than a single man. You shall pick the others. It seems simple, but I can assure you it is not. Among the Albanian tribesmen, I am told, there is a disposition to doubt the justice of our cause and the cause of our allies. A spirit of unrest is rife there. I would have it looked into. I have faith in the majority of the Albanians, but a few agitators could do much harm right now. The reason I say one man could"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12805"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Balkan Campaign; Or, the Struggle to Save a Nation (#3)"],["body","undertake the task is that he would hardly have time to cover the necessary ground. Two might do; even more would be better.\"  At this point Colonel Anderson stepped forward.  \"If you please, your majesty,\" he said, and hesitated.  \"Speak, sir,\" said the king.  \"If you please, your majesty,\" Colonel Anderson repeated, \"it would give me, and my friends here, the utmost pleasure to be of some slight service to you. With your permission, we shall offer our services to Colonel Edwards.\"  A smile stole over the king's rugged face.  \"I have always said,\" he declared, \"that the British and the Americans come nearer to being like my own people than any others. You have my permission, sir, for yourself and your friends, and I have no doubt of the success of the mission.\" He turned again to Colonel Edwards. \"You will make all possible haste?\"  \"What we may, with caution,\" was the reply.  \"Good. Then I shall expect you back within the week.\"  Again all bowed before the king and after a few words of farewell the Montenegrin monarch resumed his walk.  \"Well, I feel better now,\" declared Hal. \"We've got something to do, so we won't feel as though we had no business here.\"  \"My sentiments, exactly,\" agreed Chester.  \"Well, they are not mine,\" declared Stubbs. \"Say! what's the matter with you fellows, anyhow? Look at all the trouble we had finding a safe place to come down, and now you are running around looking for more trouble. You are not going to get Anthony Stubbs into any Albanian mountains, I can tell you that.\"  \"You don't have to go if you don't want to, I'm sure,\" said Colonel Anderson stiffly. \"I had no idea you were afraid.\"  \"Afraid!\" echoed Stubbs. \"And why shouldn't I be afraid, I ask you? Why shouldn't I be afraid, eh? I don't know anything about mountains. I don't know anything about mountaineers. I don't want to know anything about any of them. All I want to do is--\"  \"Get a little news for the _New York Gazette_,\" Chester interrupted.  \"Eh?\" exclaimed Stubbs. \"What's that? News? Sure, I've got to get some news. By George! Might be a good feature story up in those mountains.\" He turned to Colonel Edwards. \"Count me in on this little trip, will you?\" he said.  Colonel Edwards hesitated. He didn't know Stubbs as well as the others.  \"Well--\" he began.  \"Oh, he's all right, Colonel,\" said Hal. \"It's just his way. He's no coward. He is no more afraid than you are.\"  \"Don't you believe it, Colonel,\" said Stubbs. \"I assure you I am scared to death. But I am more afraid of losing my job with the _New York Gazette_ than I am of these Albanian mountaineers, so if I go I am just choosing the lesser of two evils. I want to go with you fellows. But please remember one thing: I'm no fighter. If it comes to a fight, you can count me out; but if it's a question of run--well, you'll find me with you, or far ahead.\"  \"Then if the others have no objections, I am sure that I shall be pleased to have you accompany us,\" said Colonel Edwards.  \"And when shall we start?\" asked Hal.  \"Just as soon as we can.\"  \"Walk, ride, or what?\"  \"Horses, until we reach the top of the mountains. Then we'll walk. Also, we will discard our uniforms--anyhow, I don't imagine you like the cut of those Austrian garments.\"  \"I don't, and that's the truth,\" Hal agreed.  \"Good. We'll change immediately. You go to my quarters and wait. I'll rustle up some civilian clothes and have them sent you. Also I'll arrange for our mounts and other details. I'll meet you here two hours from now.\"  With this Colonel Edwards betook himself away and the others returned to his quarters.  Half an hour later the clothes arrived and the four friends hastened to climb into them, Stubbs the while muttering to himself.  \"Great Scott, Stubbs!\" said Hal at last. \"Quit your grumbling. Any one would think you were going to a funeral.\"  \"And so I am--maybe,\" returned the little man. \"And what worries me is that it is likely to be my own.\"  \"You are a cheerful sort of a companion, I must say,\" declared Chester. \"What's the use of yelling before you are hurt?\"  \"Because I probably won't be able to afterwards,\" was the reply.  Colonel Edwards was waiting when the four made their way to the appointed spot. The horses were picketed nearby.  \"All ready?\" asked the colonel. \"Guns? Ammunition?\"  All nodded.  \"Then there is no use waiting longer. We may as well be moving.\"  He led the way to the horses and leaped lightly to the saddle. The others followed suit. Edwards waited until all were mounted and then headed his horse toward the north.  \"Let us ride,\" he said.  All through the morning hours and well into the afternoon they rode along without adventure. They were challenged several times by Montenegrin outposts, but were allowed to proceed after an explanation by Colonel Edwards.  It was four o'clock by Hal's watch when Colonel Edwards at last drew rein in the far outskirts of a tiny mountain village.  \"We'll leave our horses here,\" said the colonel, dismounting.  He led the way to a small barn near a smaller hut. Approaching the hut he gave a loud whistle. A man emerged and Colonel Edwards engaged him in conversation. At length the man nodded. Colonel Edwards turned to the others.  \"We'll turn our horses over to him,\" he said. \"I told him we would be back within seven days and wanted him to keep the animals here for us. He has agreed.\"  \"But will he?\" asked Hal.  Colonel Edwards shrugged his shoulders.  \"You know as much about it as I do,\" he replied. \"However, we have no choice.\"  \"Well, they might come in handy if we get back,\" declared Stubbs. \"When we return this far we are liable to be in considerable of a hurry, and if the horses were not here it would be a terrible disappointment for us, at least. If we come back, we'll probably come on the run.\"  \"And why will we come on the run?\" Chester wanted to know.  \"Bayonets behind,\" returned Stubbs briefly. \"Rifles, revolvers and whatnots. Oh, yes, we'll--\"  \"Stubbs,\" said Hal severely, \"you would be a kill-joy at any feast. When it comes to plain, downright pessimism, you take the cake. Your equal does not exist.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say I'm good for something,\" muttered Stubbs.  \"Well, if a pessimist is good for anything, you come first always,\" said Chester.  By this time the mountaineer had stabled their horses. Colonel Edwards gave him a piece of money, and mumbling his thanks, the man moved away.  \"Which way?\" asked Colonel Anderson.  Colonel Edwards drew a small map from his pocket, which he consulted for some moments.  \"About five miles straight along this mountain road,\" he said at last. \"There we cross the Albanian frontier, and there, also, we part company, or some of us do. Some of us will strike off to the right and the others to the left. You know what his majesty said. We would not learn much if we all went together.\"  \"True,\" returned Hal. \"Well, let's be moving.\"  They trudged along the rough, hilly road at a fair gait; but the walking was difficult and it was almost two hours later that Colonel Edwards again called a halt at what appeared to be a fork in the mountain pass.  \"We'll split up here,\" he said briefly.  \"And how?\" asked Chester.  \"That's up to you fellows. Of course, I'll take charge of one party, and I suppose Colonel Anderson should be entrusted with the other.\"  \"Of course,\" said Chester. \"I'll go with Colonel Anderson. Hal and Stubbs can go with you.\"  \"One way as well as another,\" was the reply.  And so it was decided. There was a last handshake all around and the two parties went their separate ways--Colonel Anderson and Chester taking the more level trail to the right, and Colonel Edwards, Hal and Stubbs moving off along the rough pass to the left, leading more abruptly upward.     CHAPTER V.  A SHOT FROM AMBUSH.   Up, up and still up the road that Colonel Edwards, Hal and Stubbs had selected continued, winding first to the right and then to the left until all three had practically lost all sense of direction. Hal mentioned this.  \"Don't know just where we are,\" he said.  \"No,\" agreed Colonel Edwards. \"However, it doesn't make much difference. We'll be around here for several days. Chances are the sun will come out before we get ready to leave and then we can get our bearings.\"  \"Maybe there won't be any sun,\" said Stubbs.  \"There you go again,\" said Hal. \"Of course there'll be a sun. What's the use of hunting trouble?\"  \"I'm not hunting trouble,\" Stubbs disclaimed. \"I just said maybe there won't be any sun.\"  Hal threw up both hands in a gesture of dismay.  \"You're beyond hope,\" he declared.  After what seemed like hours of climbing, though in reality it was not more than two at the most, the three reached what apparently was the top of the mountain, and the road stretched out level ahead of them, heavily shaded on both sides with trees.  \"Nice place for a fellow to hide and shoot a man,\" said Stubbs almost cheerfully.  Hal just looked at the little man but said nothing. Edwards grinned.  \"Real cheerful little fellow, aren't you?\" he said dryly.  Stubbs grinned back at him.  \"I just said--\" he began.  \"We heard you,\" interrupted Hal.  The three trudged along silently for a few moments. Then, coming to a place where the trees crowded the road even closer and the branches hung low across their path, Stubbs again broke the silence.  \"An assassin--\" he began.  The interruption this time came from another source.  The little man's hat suddenly leaped from his head. There was the low whine of a bullet and a rifle cracked from the woods on the left.  Stubbs threw himself to the ground almost before his hat settled near him and he gave a loud cry.  \"Help!\"  Startled though they were by the unexpectedness of the attack, Colonel Edwards and Hal acted promptly. A revolver flashed in the hand of each and both fired into the woods toward the point from which the shot had come. Then they leaped for shelter among the trees that lined the road on the right. Stubbs, for the moment forgotten, still lay in"]]]
