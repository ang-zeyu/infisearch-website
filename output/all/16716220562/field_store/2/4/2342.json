Time: Ten years ago.  BERT  'Ow goes it, Bill?  BILL  Goes it? 'Ow d'yer think it goes?  BERT  I don't know, Bill. 'Ow is it?  BILL  Bloody.  BERT  Why? What's wrong?  BILL  Wrong? Nothing ain't wrong.  BERT  What's up then?  BILL  Nothing ain't right.  BERT  Why, wot's the worry?  BILL  Wot's the worry? They don't give you better wages nor a dog, and then they thinks they can talk at yer and talk at yer, and say wot they likes, like.  BERT  Why? You been on the carpet, Bill?  BILL  Ain't I! Proper.   BERT  Why, wot about, Bill?  BILL  Wot about? I'll tell yer. Just coz I let a lidy get into a train. That's wot about. Said I ought to 'av stopped 'er. Thought the train was moving. Thought it was dangerous. Thought I tried to murder 'er, I suppose.  BERT  Wot? The other day?  BILL  Yes.  BERT  Tuesday?  BILL  Yes.  BERT  Why. The one that dropped her bag?  BILL  Yes. Drops 'er bag. Writes to the company. They writes back she shouldn't 'av got in. She writes back she should. Then they gets on to me. Any more of it and I'll...  BERT  I wouldn't, Bill; don't you.  BILL  I will.  BERT  Don't you, Bill. You've got your family to consider.  BILL  Well, anyway, I won't let any more of them passengers go jumping into trains any more, not when they're moving, I won't. When the train gets in, doors shut. That's the rule. And they'll 'ave to abide by it.  BERT  Well, I wouldn't stop one, not if...  BILL  I don't care. They ain't going to 'ave me on the mat again and talk all that stuff to me. No, if someone 'as to suffer... 'Ere she is.  [Noise of approaching train heard.]  BERT  Ay, that's her.  BILL  And shut goes the door.  [Enter JOHN BEAL.]  BERT  Wait a moment, Bill.  BILL  Not if he's... Not if he was ever so.  JOHN [preparing to pass]  Good morning....  BILL  Can't come through. Too late.  JOHN  Too late? Why, the train's only just in.  BILL  Don't care. It's the rule.  JOHN  O, nonsense. [He carries on.]  BILL  It's too late. I tell you you can't come.  JOHN  But that's absurd. I want to catch my train.  BILL  It's too late.  BERT  Let him go, Bill.  BILL  I'm blowed if I let him go.  JOHN  I want to catch my train.  [JOHN is stopped by BILL and pushed back by the face. JOHN advances towards BILL looking like fighting. The train has gone.]  BILL  Only doing my duty.  [JOHN stops and reflects at this, deciding it isn't good enough. He shrugs his shoulders, turns round and goes away.]  JOHN  I shouldn't be surprised if I didn't get even with you one of these days, you..... and some way you won't expect.  Curtain  SCENE 2  Yesterday evening.  [Curtain rises on JOHN and MARY in their suburban home.]  JOHN  I say, dear. Don't you think we ought to plant an acacia?  MARY  An acacia, what's that, John?  JOHN  O, it's one of those trees that they have.  MARY  But why, John?  JOHN  Well, you see the house is called The Acacias, and it seems rather silly not to have at least one.  MARY  O, I don't think that matters. Lots of places are called lots of things. Everyone does.  JOHN  Yes, but it might help the postman.  MARY  O, no, it wouldn't, dear. He wouldn't know an acacia if he saw it any more than I should.  JOHN  Quite right, Mary, you're always right. What a clever head you've got!  MARY  Have I, John? We'll plant an acacia if you like. I'll ask about it at the grocer's.  JOHN  You can't get one there.  MARY  No, but he's sure to know where it can be got.  JOHN  Where do they grow, Mary?  MARY  I don't know, John; but I am sure they do, somewhere.  JOHN  Somehow I wish sometimes, I almost wish I could have gone abroad for a week or so to places like where acacias grow naturally.  MARY  O, would you really, John?  JOHN  No, not really. But I just think of it sometimes.  MARY  Where would you have gone?  JOHN  O, I don't know. The East or some such place. I've often heard people speak of it, and somehow it seemed so...  MARY  The East, John? Not the East. I don't think the East somehow is quite respectable.  JOHN  O well, it's all right, I never went, and never shall go now. It doesn't matter.  MARY [the photographs catching her eye]  O, John, I meant to tell you. Such a dreadful thing happened.  JOHN  What, Mary?  MARY  Well, Liza was dusting the photographs, and when she came to Jane's she says she hadn't really begun to dust it, only looked at it, and it fell down, and that bit of glass is broken right out of it.  JOHN  Ask her not to look at it so hard another time.  MARY  O, what do you mean, John?  JOHN  Well, that's how she broke it; she said so, and as I know you believe in Liza...  MARY  Well, I can't think she'd tell a lie, John.  JOHN  No, of course not. But she mustn't look so hard another time.  MARY  And it's poor little Jane's photograph. She will feel it so.  JOHN  O, that's all right, we'll get it mended.  MARY  Still, it's a dreadful thing to have happened.  JOHN  We'll get it mended, and if Jane is unhappy about it she can have Alice's frame. Alice is too young to notice it.  MARY  She isn't, John. She'd notice it quick.  JOHN  Well, George, then.  MARY [looking at photo thoughtfully]  Well, perhaps George might give up his frame.  JOHN  Yes, tell Liza to change it. Why not make her do it now?  MARY  Not to-day, John. Not on a Sunday. She shall do it to-morrow by the time you get back from the office.  JOHN  All right. It might have been worse.  MARY  It's bad enough. I wish it hadn't happened.  JOHN  It might have been worse. It might have been Aunt Martha.  MARY  I'd sooner it had been her than poor little Jane.  JOHN  If it had been Aunt Martha's photograph she'd have walked in next day and seen it for certain; I know Aunt Martha. Then there'd have been trouble.  MARY  But, John, how could she have known?  JOHN  I don't know, but she would have; it's a kind of devilish sense she has.  MARY  John!  JOHN  What's the matter?  MARY  John! What a dreadful word you used. And on a Sunday too! Really!  JOHN  O, I'm sorry. It slipped out somehow. I'm very sorry.  [Enter LIZA.]  LIZA  There's a gentleman to see you, sir, which isn't, properly speaking, a gentleman at all. Not what I should call one, that is, like.  MARY  Not a gentleman! Good gracious, Liza! Whatever do you mean?  LIZA  He's black.  MARY  Black?  JOHN [reassuring]  O... yes, that would be Ali. A queer old customer, Mary; perfectly harmless. Our firm gets hundreds of carpets through him; and then one day...  MARY  But what is he doing here, John?  JOHN  Well, one day he turned up in London; broke, he said; and wanted the firm to give him a little cash. Well, old Briggs was for giving him ten shillings. But I said \"here's a man that's helped us in making thousands of pounds. Let's give him fifty.\"  MARY  Fifty pounds!  JOHN  Yes, it seems a lot; but it seemed only fair. Ten shillings would have been an insult to the old fellow, and he'd have taken it as such. You don't know what he'd have done.  MARY  Well, he doesn't want more?  JOHN  No, I expect he's come to thank me. He seemed pretty keen on getting some cash. Badly broke, you see. Don't know what he was doing in London. Never can tell with these fellows. East is East, and there's an end of it.  MARY  How did he trace you here?  JOHN  O, got the address at the office. Briggs and Cater won't let theirs be known. Not got such a smart little house, I expect.  MARY  I don't like letting people in that you don't know where they come from.  JOHN  O, he comes from the East.  MARY  Yes, I--I know. But the East doesn't seem quite to count, somehow, as the proper sort of place to come from, does it, dear?  JOHN  No.  MARY  It's not like Sydenham or Bromley, some place you can put your finger on.  JOHN  Perhaps just for once, I don't think there's any harm in him.  MARY  Well, just for once. But we can't make a practice of it. And you don't want to be thinking of business on a Sunday, your only day off.  JOHN  O, it isn't business, you know. He only wants to say thank you.  MARY  I hope he won't say it in some queer Eastern way. You don't know what these people....  JOHN  O, no. Show him up, Liza.  LIZA  As you like, mum. [Exit.]  MARY  And you gave him fifty pounds?  JOHN  Well, old Briggs agreed to it. So I suppose that's what he got. Cater paid him.  MARY  It seems a lot of money. But I think, as the man is actually coming up the stairs, I'm glad he's got something to be grateful for.  [Enter ALI, shown in by LIZA.]  ALI  Protector of the Just.  JOHN  O, er--yes. Good evening.  ALI  My soul was parched and you bathed it in rivers of gold.  JOHN  O, ah, yes.  ALI  Wherefore the name Briggs, Cater, and Beal shall be magnified and called blessed.  JOHN  Ha, yes. Very good of you.  ALI [advancing, handing trinket]  Protector of the Just, my offering.  JOHN  Your offering?  ALI  Hush. It is beyond price. I am not bidden to sell it. I was in my extremity, but I was not bidden to sell it. It is a token of gratitude, a gift, as it came to me.  JOHN  As it came to you?   ALI  Yes, it was given me.  JOHN  I see. Then you had given somebody what you call rivers of gold?  ALI  Not gold; it was in Sahara.  JOHN  O, and what do you give in the Sahara instead of gold?  ALI  Water.  JOHN  I see. You got it for a glass of water, like.  ALI  Even so.  JOHN  And--and what happened?  MARY  I wouldn't take his only crystal, dear. It's a nice little thing, but [to ALI], but you think a lot of it, don't you?  ALI  Even so."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1311"],["title","If: A Play in Four Acts (#1)"],["body","But look here, what does it do?  ALI  Much.  JOHN  Well, what?  ALI  He that taketh this crystal, so, in his hand, at night, and wishes, saying \"At a certain hour let it be\"; the hour comes and he will go back eight, ten, even twelve years if he will, into the past, and do a thing again, or act otherwise than he did. The day passes; the ten years are accomplished once again; he is here once more; but he is what he might have become had he done that one thing otherwise.  MARY  John!  JOHN  I--I don't understand.  ALI  To-night you wish. All to-morrow you live the last ten years; a new way, master, a new way, how you please. To-morrow night you are here, what those years have made you.  JOHN  By Jove!  MARY  Have nothing to do with it, John.  JOHN  All right, Mary, I'm not going to. But, do you mean one could go back ten years?   ALI  Even so.   JOHN  Well, it seems odd, but I'll take your word for it. But look here, you can't live ten years in a day, you know.  ALI  My master has power over time.  MARY  John, don't have anything to do with him.  JOHN  All right, Mary. But who is your master?  ALI  He is carved of one piece of jade, a god in the greenest mountains. The years are his dreams. This crystal is his treasure. Guard it safely, for his power is in this more than in all the peaks of his native hills. See what I give you, master.  JOHN  Well, really, it's very good of you.  MARY  Good night, Mr. Ali. We are very much obliged for your kind offer, which we are so sorry we can't avail ourselves of.  JOHN  One moment, Mary. Do you mean that I can go back ten years, and live till--till now again, and only be away a day?  ALI  Start early and you will be here before midnight.  JOHN  Would eight o'clock do!  ALI  You could be back by eleven that evening.  JOHN  I don't quite see how ten years could go in a single day.  ALI  They will go as dreams go.  JOHN  Even so, it seems rather unusual, doesn't it?  ALI  Time is the slave of my master  MARY  John!  JOHN  All right, Mary. [In a lower voice.] I'm only trying to see what he'll say.  MARY  All right, John, only...  ALI  Is there no step that you would wish untrodden, nor stride that you would make where once you faltered?  JOHN  I say, why don't you use it yourself?  ALI  I? I am afraid of the past. But you Engleesh, and the great firm of Briggs, Cater, and Beal; you are afraid of nothing.  JOHN  Ha, ha. Well--I wouldn't go quite as far as that, but--well, give me the crystal.  MARY  Don't take it, John! Don't take it.  JOHN  Why, Mary? It won't hurt me.  MARY  If it can do all that--if it can do all that...  JOHN  Well?  MARY  Why, you might never have met me.  JOHN  Never have met you? I never thought of that.  MARY  Leave the past alone, John.  JOHN  All right, Mary. I needn't use it. But I want to hear about it, it's so odd, it's so what-you-might-call queer; I don't think I ever----- [To ALI.] You mean if I work hard for ten years, which will only be all to-morrow, I may be Governor of the Bank of England to-morrow night.  ALI  Even so.  MARY  O, don't do it, John.  JOHN  But you said--I'll be back here before midnight to-morrow.  ALI  It is so.  JOHN  But the Governor of the Bank of England would live in the City, and he'd have a much bigger house anyway. He wouldn't live in Lewisham.  ALI  The crystal will bring you to this house when the hour is accomplished, even tomorrow night. If you be the great banker you will perhaps come to chastise one of your slaves who will dwell in this house. If you be head of Briggs and Cater you will come to give an edict to one of your firm. Perchance this street will be yours and you will come to show your power unto it. But you will come.  JOHN  And if the house is not mine?  MARY  John! John! Don't.  ALI  Still you will come.  JOHN  Shall I remember?  ALI  No.  JOHN  If I want to do anything different to what I did, how shall I remember when I get back there?  MARY  Don't. Don't do anything different, John.  JOHN  All right.  ALI  Choose just before the hour of the step you desire to change. Memory lingers a little at first, and fades away slowly.  JOHN  Five minutes?  ALI  Even ten.  JOHN  Then I can change one thing. After that I forget.  ALI  Even so. One thing. And the rest follows.  JOHN  Well, it's very good of you to make me this nice present, I'm sure.  ALI  Sell it not. Give it, as I gave it, if the heart impels. So shall it come back one day to the hills that are brighter than grass, made richer by the gratitude of many men. And my master shall smile thereat and the vale shall be glad.  JOHN  It's very good of you, I'm sure.  MARY  I don't like it, John. I don't like tampering with what's gone.  ALI  My master's power is in your hands. Farewell.  [Exit.]  JOHN  I say, he's gone.  MARY  O, he's a dreadful man.  JOHN  I never really meant to take it.  MARY  O, John, I wish you hadn't  JOHN  Why? I'm not going to use it.  MARY  Not going to use it, John?  JOHN  No, no. Not if you don't want me to.  MARY  O, I'm so glad.  JOHN  And besides, I don't want things different. I've got fond of this little house. And Briggs is a good old sort, you know. Cater's a bit of an ass, but there's no harm in him. In fact, I'm contented, Mary. I wouldn't even change Aunt Martha now.  [Points at frowning framed photograph centrally hung.]  You remember when she first came and you said \"Where shall we hang her?\" I said the cellar. You said we couldn't. So she had to go there. But I wouldn't change her now. I suppose there are old watch-dogs like her in every family. I wouldn't change anything.  MARY  O, John, wouldn't you really?  JOHN  No, I'm contented. Grim old soul, I wouldn't even change Aunt Martha.  MARY  I'm glad of that, John. I was frightened. I couldn't bear to tamper with the past. You don't know what it is, it's what's gone. But if it really isn't gone at all, if it can be dug up like that, why you don't know what mightn't happen! I don't mind the future, but if the past can come back like that.... O, don't, don't, John. Don't think of it. It isn't canny. There's the children, John.  JOHN  Yes, yes, that's all right. It's only a little ornament. I won't use it. And I tell you I'm content. [Happily] It's no use to me.  MARY  I'm so glad you're content, John. Are you really? Is there nothing that you'd have had different? I sometimes thought you'd rather that Jane had been a boy.  JOHN  Not a bit of it. Well, I may have at the time, but Arthur's good enough for me.  MARY  I'm so glad. And there's nothing you ever regret at all?  JOHN  Nothing. And you? Is there nothing you regret, Mary?  MARY  Me? Oh, no. I still think that sofa would have been better green, but you would have it red.  JOHN  Yes, so I would. No, there's nothing I regret.  MARY  I don't suppose there's many men can say that.  JOHN  No, I don't suppose they can. They're not all married to you. I don't suppose many of them can.  [MARY smiles.]  MARY  I should think that very few could say that they regretted nothing... very few in the whole world.  JOHN  Well, I won't say nothing.  MARY  What is it you regret, John?  JOHN  Well, there is one thing.  MARY  And what is that?  JOHN  One thing has rankled a bit.  MARY  Yes, John?  JOHN  O, it's nothing, it's nothing worth mentioning. But it rankled for years.  MARY  What was it, John?  JOHN  O, it seems silly to mention it. It was nothing.  MARY  But what?  JOHN  O, well, if you want to know, it was once when I missed a train. I don't mind missing a train, but it was the way the porter pushed me out of the way. He pushed me by the face. I couldn't hit back, because, well, you know what lawyers make of it; I might have been ruined. So it just rankled. It was years ago before we married.  MARY  Pushed you by the face. Good gracious!  JOHN  Yes, I'd like to have caught that train in spite of him. I sometimes think of it still. Silly of me, isn't it?  MARY  What a brute of a man.  JOHN  O, I suppose he was doing his silly duty. But it rankled.  MARY  He'd no right to do any such thing! He'd no right to touch you!  JOHN  O, well, never mind.  MARY  I should like to have been there... I'd have...  JOHN  O, well, it can't be helped now; but I'd like to have caught it in sp... [An idea seizes him.]  MARY  What is it?  JOHN  Can't be helped, I said. It's the very thing that can be helped.  MARY  Can be helped, John? Whatever do you mean?  JOHN  I mean he'd no right to stop me catching that train. I've got the crystal, and I'll catch it yet!  MARY  O, John, that's what you said you wouldn't do.  JOHN  No. I said I'd do nothing to alter the past. And I won't. I'm too content, Mary. But this can't alter it. This is nothing.  MARY  What were you going to catch the train for, John?  JOHN  For London. I wasn't at the office then. It was a business appointment. There was a man who had promised to get me a job, and I was going up to...  MARY  John, it may alter your whole life!  JOHN  Now do listen, Mary, do listen. He never turned up. I got a letter from him apologising to me before I posted mine to him. It turned out he never meant to help me, mere meaningless affabilities. He never came to London that day at all. I should have taken the next train back. That can't affect the future.  MARY  N-no, John. Still, I don't like it.  JOHN  What difference could it make?  MARY  N-n-no.  JOHN  Think how we met. We met at ARCHIE's wedding. I take it one has to go to one's brother's wedding. It would take a pretty big change to alter that. And. you were her bridesmaid. We were bound to meet. And having once met, well, there you are. If we'd met by chance, in a train, or anything like that, well, then I admit some little change might alter it. But when we met at ARCHIE's wedding and you were her bridesmaid, why, Mary, it's a cert. Besides, I believe in predestination. It was our fate; we couldn't have missed it.  MARY  No, I suppose not; still..  JOHN  Well, what?  MARY  I don't like it.  JOHN  O, Mary, I have so longed to catch"]]]
