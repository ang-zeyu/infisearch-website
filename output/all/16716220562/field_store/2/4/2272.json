Then let's turn in. I've a feeling it's going to be a strenuous day to-morrow.\"  And it was; though not strenuous in the way Hal had expected.     CHAPTER VI  A PERILOUS SITUATION   Hal and Chester held no conversation with Anthony Stubbs the following day, and therefore were unable to learn more than they already knew of the war correspondent's great \"story.\"  Before they rose Stubbs was up and gone, and when he returned, several hours later, Hal and Chester were receiving orders from General Petain.  The German advance had continued the day before in spite of the heroic stand of the French troops. Successive charges by the Teuton hordes had driven the defenders back along practically the entire front. Here, with the coming of night, they had taken a brace with the arrival of reinforcements and had stemmed the tide; but not a man failed to realize that there would be more desperate work on the morrow.  The French lines now had been pushed back well to the west of the city of Verdun itself and the civil population of the town had fled. The town had been swept by the great German guns until hardly one stone remained upon another. North of the city, the French had been bent back as the Germans thrust a wedge into the defending lines almost to the foot of Dead Man's Hill.  This hill was of particular importance to the Germans, for it commanded the approach on all sides; and now the German Prince had determined upon its capture. General Petain anticipated the move and acted promptly.  It was toward this point, then, that Hal and Chester found themselves moving upon the sixth day of the great battle. They bore despatches from General Petain and each bestrode a high-powered motorcycle, which the French commander had placed at their disposal. The two lads rode swiftly, for there was no time to be lost.  Even above the \"pop-pop\" of their motorcycles could be heard the terrible roar of the German guns as they were brought to bear on Dead Man's Hill, paving the way for an infantry advance, which was to come a few hours later. It was risky business upon which the lads were bent, for the great shells struck on all sides of them, throwing huge masses of dirt in the air like giant fountains and digging immense excavations in the hard ground.  But the lads reached their destination in safety; and here, for the first time, Hal and Chester were to come in contact with a new method of fighting.  General Domont, in command at Dead Man's Hill, having read the despatches the lads carried, announced that they would remain with him during the day, acting as members of his staff. He ordered Hal forward with instructions for the troops holding the crest of the hill to the north and Chester was despatched upon a similar mission to the south.  Hardly had Chester delivered his message when a shout told him the German infantry was advancing to the attack. The lad glanced around, and as he did so, a sharp order rang out and a moment later the French troops clamped queer-looking devices over their faces and heads.  Chester knew what they were--gas masks to protect the defenders from the poisonous vapors of German gas bombs, which, had the defenders not been protected by masks, would have killed them instantly. A passing officer said something unintelligible to the lad as he passed and pointed to the ground. Glancing down, the lad perceived a mask and then understood that the officer had meant for him to put it on. Chester did so, though not without some difficulty, for he had trouble adjusting it. But with his nostrils protected at last, Chester turned to watch the approach of the enemy.  The Germans came forward in a dense mass, despite the fearful execution worked in their ranks by the French guns. In the lines of the defenders dropped huge bombs that sent up dense vapors--the deadly gasses of the foe--but they caused little harm, for the French were protected. Now and then a man fell, however; perhaps he had failed to adjust his helmet properly, or perhaps it was not perfect. But for the most part the gas bombs had little effect.  The first concerted attack of the German troops availed little; and after trying for half an hour to gain a foothold in the French lines they withdrew. But a second attack followed a few moments later. This also was beaten off. A third attack, however, met with better success.  This time the Germans succeeded in gaining a hold in the French lines, and this they retained in spite of repeated counter assaults by the French. Bravely the men charged, but they could make no impression on the positions so recently won by the foe. The troops of the German Crown Prince stood firm.  The French were forced to retreat toward the summit of the hill.  Here the big French guns opened violently upon the enemy, but the invaders remained in spite of the hail of death.  Chester had been carried back with the French retreat and he now found himself almost in the first line. He was sadly disappointed, for he had felt sure that the French effort to repel the attack would be successful.  His men still falling back before the German advance, General Domont determined upon a bold stroke. Orders were given thick and fast. Hal and Chester, returning from their first missions of the day, found themselves again near the front. The orders to the various French divisional commanders were explicit. As the Germans advanced again to the attack, the French, too, all along the line, were to take the offensive.  The men awaited the word eagerly.  At last it came. With a shout the French, still wearing their gas masks, hurled themselves forward with the troops.  Halfway down the hill the lines met with a crash. Rifles and small arms were fired point blank into the very faces of the foe and then the men fell to the work with bayonets. Both sides fought desperately.  Hal and Chester had drawn their swords and found themselves engaged with the troops. So close was the fighting that had it not been for the difference in uniform it would have been practically impossible to distinguish friend from foe.  Hal found himself engaged with a German officer of huge stature, who was endeavoring to bring the lad to earth by fierce sweeping blows of his officer's sword. Hal was hard pressed to defend himself.  As the German's sword descended in a stroke of extra violence, Hal stepped lightly aside and evaded the blow. Before the German could recover himself, Hal moved quickly forward. There was a sudden, quick movement of his arm and the German officer toppled over, to rise no more.  Hal turned just in time to see a second German officer level a revolver straight at his head. The lad ducked and the ball passed harmlessly over his head. Before the German's finger could press the trigger again Hal had raised his arm and struck.  Chester, in the meantime, had his own hands full. He had accounted for a German trooper who had sought to bring his rifle butt down on the lad's head and was now engaged with two other troopers, who sought to end his career with bayonets.  Chester sprang nimbly back as the two men advanced on him. One tripped and stumbled over a fallen comrade and as he did so Chester took advantage of his misfortune to strike with his sword. But the second German protected his fellow by catching Chester's stroke with his bayonet and for a moment Chester was at a disadvantage.  Even as the bayonet of the first trooper, who had regained his balance, would have pierced him, however, Chester dropped flat on the ground and seized one of the man's legs. The German dropped his bayonet and crashed to the ground. Chester sprang up quickly and jumped to one side to escape the point of the bayonet in the hands of the second trooper.  Chester thrust with his sword, but the effort was futile. The point of the lad's sword fell short. Again the lad was at a disadvantage and the German grinned as he stepped forward to end the combat. His bayonet was pointed straight at the lad's breast and it seemed as though nothing but a miracle could save the boy.  But the miracle happened. Suddenly the German dropped his bayonet with a crash and threw up both arms. He spun on his heel and then fell to the ground without an outcry. A stray bullet had done what Chester had been unable to accomplish, and for the moment the lad was safe.  The second trooper now returned to the attack and engaged Chester fiercely. All this time the French were gradually being forced back, and of a sudden Chester found himself the center of a mass of German troops.  But the lad had no mind to give up. Throwing caution to the winds, he now struck out swiftly and sharply with his sword. Once or twice the thrusts went home. Chester felt a sting in his left shoulder. The bayonet of a German trooper had pricked him slightly. Chester whirled about and seized the bayonet with his left hand. A powerful wrench and it was wrested from the hands of the German soldier, who had been caught off his guard.  Without taking time to reverse the weapon, Chester hurled it in the faces of the foe who pressed in about him. It struck one man squarely on the forehead and he toppled over with a groan.  Again Chester laid about him with his sword, retreating slowly as he did so. The gas helmet that he wore impeded his progress somewhat, for it was strange to his head and felt uncomfortable. Now the lad realized for the first time that the Germans before him also wore the heavy helmets.  He aimed a blow at one man's breast and it went home. At the same moment a second German brought his rifle butt down upon the lad's sword and the weapon snapped off. Chester felt a second sting in his arm and then he felt a blow across the helmet.  There was a sudden roaring sound, Chester saw a million stars flash through the air; then he threw up his arms, made a move to step forward and crashed to the ground.  The last blow had broken open Chester's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13020"],["title","The Boy Allies at Verdun; Or, Saving France from the Enemy (#6)"],["body","helmet and the lad was at the mercy of the poisonous vapors!     CHAPTER VII  HAL TO THE RESCUE   At the same moment that Chester fell to the ground, the clear note of a bugle rang out from the German rear, sounding the recall. The attack was to be given up. The resistance of the French had been too much for the foe.  Hal, who had been retreating with the other French troops, turned a second before the recall was sounded just in time to see a single form that had been struggling with a knot of the enemy crash to the ground. Hal gave a loud cry, which was stifled by his gas helmet, for he felt sure that it was Chester.  It was at that moment the German bugle sounded the recall.  Hal dashed toward the spot where Chester had fallen. A score of enemy troops, perceiving his approach, stayed their retreat and offered him battle. Hal was nothing loath. He dashed toward them at top speed.  Other French troops, seeing one of their numbers dashing forward, and perceiving his peril, jumped to the rescue. Still more Germans turned and more French dashed forward. For a moment it seemed that the struggle would be renewed in spite of the order for a German recall.  Hal dashed among the foe with sword flashing aloft. Right and left he slashed and the Germans gave way before his fury. Then they closed in. Almost at the same moment the French troops came to his assistance. Again the recall was sounded from the German rear. The few of the foe who apparently had Hal at their mercy heeded this second call reluctantly. They drew off slowly, opening upon the advancing French with their rifles as they did so. The French returned the fire and the Germans retreated faster.  Apparently it was not the plan of General Domont to follow up the retreating Germans, for there came no order for a charge. Instead, the French commander apparently was satisfied with having broken down the German attack. He had no intention of sacrificing more of his men in a useless pursuit that would bring them again under the mouths of the big German guns.  Quickly Hal bent over Chester. The latter had fallen with his face on the ground, and this fact undoubtedly had saved his life. He was unconscious and his nose was buried in the dirt. He had almost suffocated, but this fact had saved him from the poisonous gases. Hal stripped the gas helmet from a dead French soldier and slipped it over Chester's head. Then he lifted his chum from the ground and started toward the rear, supporting the unconscious figure as well as he could.  Several French troopers ran to his assistance. Hal lowered Chester to the ground and put both hands under his chum's head. He motioned one of the French soldiers to take Chester's feet, and in this manner they carried Chester from the danger zone.  Hal did not rest easily until after a French surgeon had pronounced Chester little the worse for his experience. Two bayonet wounds in the lad's arm were found to be mere scratches.  \"He'll pull round in a day or two,\" said the surgeon. \"In the meantime it would be well to keep him as quiet as possible, though he is in no danger.\"  Hal thanked the surgeon, and leaving Chester in safe hands, sought out General Domont and explained the circumstances to him.  \"And I would like to get him back to my own quarters,\" he concluded.  \"Very well,\" said General Domont. \"I shall place an automobile at your disposal.\"  The French officer was as good as his word and in a high-power motor car Hal and Chester, the latter having regained consciousness, were soon on their way to headquarters, Hal bearing General Domont's report on the morning's encounter.  Hal went first to the quarters of General Petain, where he delivered General Domont's report; then he accompanied Chester to their own quarters, where he made Chester as comfortable as possible.  He was just about to leave Chester alone, when another figure entered the tent. It was Stubbs.  \"Hello, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Chester from his cot. \"Where have you been all summer?\"  \"Summer?\" said Mr. Stubbs, removing his overcoat. \"This is the month of February.\"  \"All right; have it your own way,\" said Chester.  \"Well, I've just been having a look around,\" said Stubbs.  \"Find out anything more about the conspiracy?\" asked Hal.  \"What conspiracy?\" demanded Stubbs.  \"Why, the one you were telling us about the other night,\" exclaimed Chester.  Stubbs looked at the lad critically.  \"Wounded to-day, weren't you?\" he asked.  \"A trifle,\" returned Chester.  \"Any fever?\" asked Stubbs.  \"No,\" said Hal. \"Why?\"  \"Why? He's dreaming things. What's this conspiracy he's talking about?\"  Chester sat up in his cot.  \"You don't mean to tell me you don't remember what you told us about it?\" he demanded.  Stubbs tapped his head with a significant gesture and nodded to Hal.  \"Did you have a surgeon look at him?\" he asked.  \"Look here, Stubbs--\" began Chester angrily.  \"Here, here,\" interposed Hal. \"You lie down there, Chester. I'll talk to our friend here.\"  At this Mr. Stubbs moved toward the outside.  \"I've got to be going now,\" he announced.  \"Well, you're not going to go until you tell me what all this foolishness is about,\" declared Hal.  \"Foolishness?\"  \"Yes, foolishness. You can't deny, can you, that you told us the other night you had unearthed a conspiracy of some kind?\"  \"I can,\" said Stubbs, \"but I won't. It's my belief that there is something wrong with both of you. What would I know about a conspiracy?\"  \"That's what I would like to know,\" returned Chester, from his cot. \"If you won't tell us, I've a notion to tell General Petain what you told us.\"  \"I wouldn't if I were you,\" said Stubbs. \"It wouldn't do you any good. He probably would think your wound had affected your mind. That's what I think.\"  \"Oh, no you don't,\" said Hal. \"You are just trying to keep the thing to yourself, whatever it is. Maybe you're going to slip it by the censor to the _Gazette_, eh?\"  Stubbs made no reply.  \"If I thought that, I would tell General Petain,\" declared Chester.  \"It must be a great thing to have such imaginations,\" said Stubbs with something like a sigh. \"Some of these days, if you like, I'll get you both jobs on the _Gazette_.\"  \"Now look here, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"Laying all joking aside, are you going to tell us about this thing or not?\"  \"What thing?\" demanded Stubbs.  \"By George!\" ejaculated Hal in exasperation. \"You're the limit, Stubbs.\"  \"Sure I am,\" was the little man's smiling response. \"Otherwise, I wouldn't be in this tent with you.\"  \"Stubbs,\" said Chester, a sudden idea striking him, \"have we done something you don't like?\"  \"You have,\" was Stubbs' reply.  \"By Jove!\" said Hal. \"We're sorry for that, Stubbs. We apologize. Will you tell us what we've done?\"  Stubbs looked at the lad with a peculiar smile on his face. He was silent several moments before replying:  \"You don't know, eh?\"  \"Of course not.\"  Stubbs shrugged his shoulders and started out of the tent.  \"Say!\" Chester called after him, \"are you going to tell us or not?\"  \"Not!\" said Stubbs briefly, and was gone.  \"Now what do you think of that?\" demanded Chester of his chum.  \"There's something wrong with him,\" was Hal's reply. \"I haven't any idea what it can be.\"  \"Suppose it is because we were poking fun at him the other night?\"  \"I don't know. I don't believe he would take a thing like that to heart. However, you can't tell.\"  \"Anyhow,\" said Chester, \"we're not likely to find out what it's all about until he gets good and ready to tell us.\"  \"You're right, there,\" returned Hal. \"He can be as mum as an oyster when he wants to. Well, old boy, I'll leave you alone now and go out and look around a bit. Maybe I can stumble on this conspiracy Stubbs talks about.\"  \"You mean the one he won't talk about,\" said Chester with a smile. \"All right. Go ahead. I'll take a little snooze.\"  He rolled over on his side as Hal left the tent.  How long Chester slept he did not know, but it was dark in the tent when he opened his eyes.  \"Wonder what can be keeping Hal?\" he muttered to himself.  He had hardly had spoken the words when a form came through the entrance to the tent. Chester was about to speak, for he thought at first that it was Hal, but something seemed to tell him to remain silent. The lad, therefore, said nothing.  At second glance Chester realized that the figure that had entered the tent was not Hal. Neither was it Stubbs.  \"Great Scott!\" muttered the lad to himself. \"Wonder who he is and what he wants here? He hasn't seen me though. Guess I'll wait and see what happens.\"  The lad stretched out a hand carefully and drew toward him a camp stool upon which he had laid his clothes before going to bed. Without a sound he secured one of his revolvers and straightened to a sitting posture.  \"I'm ready for whatever happens,\" he told himself.  The intruder had now taken up such a position in the tent as to command a view of the entrance, shielded from sight himself. Chester saw something glisten in the man's hand.  \"Gun,\" said the boy to himself. \"Guess I can beat him to it.\"  Came footsteps without. They stopped just outside the tent. Chester saw the nocturnal visitor in the tent raise his revolver arm. Chester did likewise.  \"I'll just shoot that gun out of your hand, my friend,\" he said quietly.  He took deliberate aim.     CHAPTER VIII  AN UNKNOWN ENEMY   The footsteps outside came nearer the entrance. Chester's finger tightened on the trigger of his revolver, as he saw the stranger in the tent draw himself taut.  At that moment Hal's figure appeared in the entrance.  There were two sharp cracks, so close that they seemed as one, and two spurts of flame in the darkness. Came a cry of pain from the stranger in the tent and Hal dashed forward.  \"Quick, Hal! Grab him!\" shouted Chester.  But quick as he was, Hal was not quick enough. With a snarl the man jumped toward Hal even as Hal leaped himself. The stranger was of much greater bulk than Hal and the lad was hurled to the ground. When he regained his feet the stranger "]]]
