Ah, though 'tis many a year   Since you were here,   Still do I see your beauteous face   And with the glow   Of your dark eyes cometh a grace   Of long ago._  The Mistress French of our earlier acquaintance, who was a widow when we last knew her in Newfane, had married again and, as Mistress Thomas Jones, had moved with her daughter, Mary Field French, to Amherst, Mass. To the home of Mrs. Jones and the loving care of Miss French, Eugene and Roswell, Jr., were entrusted. Miss French was at this time a young woman, a spinster--Eugene delighted to call her--of about thirty years. His old Munson tutor thus describes her:  \"Mary Field French, a daughter of Mrs. Jones by her first husband, was a lady of strong mind, and much culture, with a sound judgment and decision of character and very gracious manners. She was always sociable and agreeable and so admirably adapted to the charge of the two brothers.\" They retained through manhood the warmest affection for this cousin-mother, and never wearied in showing toward her the grateful devotion of loyal sons.  \"Here,\" continues Dr. Tufts, \"in this charming home, under the best of New England influences and religious instruction, with nothing harsh or repulsive, the boys could not have found a more congenial home. Indeed, few mothers are able or even capable of doing so much for their own children as Miss French did for these two brothers, watching over them incessantly, yet not spoiling them by weak indulgence or repelling them by harsh discipline.\"  [Illustration: EUGENE FIELD'S COUSINS, MARY FIELD FRENCH AND HER YOUNGER HALF SISTER, AUGUSTA JONES. _From a daguerreotype taken before Eugene and Roswell became members of Miss French's family in Amherst, on the death of their mother._]  Here it was that Eugene was brought up in the \"nurture and admonition of the Lord,\" as he would often declare with a mock severity of tone, that left a mixed impression as to the beneficence of the nurture and the abiding quality of the admonition. Here he spent his school days, not in acquiring a broad or deep basis for future scholarship, but in studying the ways and whims of womankind, in practising the subtile arts whereby the boy of from six to fifteen attains a tyrannous mastery over the hearts of a feminine household, and in securing the leadership among the daring spirits of his own age and sex, for whom he was early able to furnish a continuous programme of entertainment, adventure, and mischief.  Of this period of Eugene Field's life we get the truest glimpse through the eyes of his brother, who has written appreciatively of their boyhood spent in Amherst. \"His boyhood,\" writes Roswell, \"was similar to that of other boys brought up with the best surroundings in a Massachusetts village, where the college atmosphere prevailed. He had his boyish pleasures and his trials, his share of that queer mixture of nineteenth century worldliness and almost austere Puritanism, which is yet characteristic of many New England families.\"  If the reader wishes to know more of the New England atmosphere, in which Eugene Field was permitted to have pretty much his own sweet way by his cousin and aunt, let him have recourse to Mrs. Earle's \"The Sabbath in Puritan New England,\" which I find in my library commended to my perusal, \"with Eugene Field's love, December 25th, 1891\"--and to other books by the same author. In a letter to Mrs. Earle, from which I quoted in the opening paragraph of this narrative, I find the following reference to the period of his life which we are now considering:  \"Fourteen years of my life were spent in Newfane, Vt., and Amherst, Mass. My lovely old grandmother was one of the very elect. How many times have I carried her footstove for her and filled it in the vestry-room. I have frozen in the old pew while grandma kept nice and warm and nibbled lozenges and cassia cakes during meeting. I remember the old sounding-board. There was no melodeon in that meeting-house; and the leader of the choir pitched the tune with a tuning-fork. As a boy I used to play hi-spy in the horse-shed. But I am not so very old--no, a man is still a boy at forty, isn't he?\"  [Illustration: THE FIELD HOMESTEAD AT NEWFANE, VT.]  Eugene Field would have been a boy at fifty and at eighty had he lived, and he was very much of a boy at the period of which he wrote to Mrs. Earle. I have no doubt that he was a very circumspect lad while under the loving yet stern glance of that dear old grandmother, in whose kindly yet dignified presence three generations of Fields moved with varying emotions of love and circumspection. \"Her husband\" (General Martin Field of our acquaintance), wrote \"Uncle Charles Kellogg,\" \"was genial and social, full of humor and mirth, oftentimes filling the house with his jocund laugh.\" She, however, \"true to her refined womanly instinct, her sense of propriety, rarely disturbed by his merry and harmless jests, with great discretion pursued 'the even tenor of her way.' Patiently and with unfaltering devotion to the higher and nobler purposes of life, she always maintained her self-possession, strenuously avoided all levity and frivolity, rarely relaxed the gravity of her deportment, and never failed in the end of controlling both husband and household.\"  Eugene's own picture of his grandmother is contained in the following passage in an article contributed by him to the Ladies' Home Journal:    \"Grandma was a pillar in the Congregational Church. At the decline   and disintegration of the Universalist society, she rejoiced   cordially as if a temple of Baal or an idol of Ashtaroth had been   overturned. Yes, grandma was Puritanical--not to the extent of   persecution, but a Puritan in the severity of her faith and in the   exacting nicety of her interpretation of her duties to God and   mankind. Grandma's Sunday began at six o'clock Saturday evening; by   that hour her house was swept and garnished, and her lamps trimmed,   every preparation made for a quiet, reverential observance of the   Sabbath Day. There was no cooking on Sunday. At noon Mrs. Deacon   Ranney and other old ladies used to come from church with grandma to   eat luncheon and discuss the sermon and suggest deeds of piety for   the ensuing week. I remember Mrs. Deacon Ranney and her frigid   companions very distinctly. They never smiled and they wore austere   bombazines that rustled and squeaked dolorously. Mrs. Deacon Ranney   seldom noticed me further than to regard me with a look that seemed   to stigmatize me as an incipient vessel of wrath that was not to be   approved of, and I never liked Mrs. Deacon Ranney after I heard her   reminding grandma one day that Solomon had truly said, 'spare the   rod and spoil the child.' I still think ill of Mrs. Deacon Ranney   for having sought to corrupt dear old grandma's gentle nature with   any such incendiary suggestions. The meeting-house was cold and   draughty, and the seats, with their straight backs, were oh, so   hard. Grandma's pew was near the pulpit. I remember now how ashamed   I used to be to carry her footstove all the way up that long aisle   for her--I was such a foolish little boy then--and now, ah me, how   ready and glad and proud I should be to do that service for dear old   grandma!    \"When grandma went to meeting she carried a lovely big black velvet   bag; it had a bouquet wrought in beads of subdued color upon it, and   it hung by two sombre silk puckering ribbons over grandma's arm. In   the bag grandma carried a supply of crackers and peppermint   lozenges, and upon these she would nibble in meeting whenever she   felt that feeling of goneness in the pit of her stomach, which I was   told old ladies sometimes suffer with. It was proper enough, I was   assured, for old ladies to nibble at crackers and peppermint   lozenges in meeting, but that such a proceeding would be very wicked   for a little boy.\"  From which it might appear that the atmosphere of Newfane, under the grave and serious deportment of his grandmother, must have been a change from the freedom Eugene and his brother enjoyed under the fond rule of Miss French at Amherst. But when I was in Newfane in 1899 I was informed by a dear old lady in bombazine, who remembered their visits distinctly, that \"Eugene and Roswell were wild boys. Not bad, but just tew full of old Nick for anything.\"  [Illustration: THE HOMESTEAD AT AMHERST, MASS. _Now owned by Mr. Hiram Eaton of New York._]  It was in Amherst, however, and not in Newfane, from Cousin Mary, and not from his dear Grandmother Esther, that Eugene got the New England \"bent\" in his Missouri mind. It is hard to separate the fact from the fancy in his story of \"My Grandmother.\" His youth from 1856 to 1865 was lived in Amherst. His only visit to the Field homestead in Newfane was when he was nine years old. And of this he has written, \"we stayed there seven months and the old lady got all the grandsons she wanted. She did not invite us to repeat the visit.\" He also confessed that all his love for nature dated from that visit. As a boy he would never have been permitted to indulge the fondness for animal pets under \"the dark penetrating eyes\" of his grandmother, that was tolerated and became a life-habit by the \"gracious love\" of Mary Field French. Of this fondness for pets, Roswell has written that it amounted to a passion. \"But unlike other boys he seemed to carry his pets into a higher sphere and to give them personality. For each pet, whether dog, cat, bird, goat, or squirrel--he had the family distrust of a horse--he not only had a name, but it was his delight to fancy that each possessed a peculiar dialect of human speech, and each he addressed in the humorous manner conceived. When in childhood he was conducting a poultry annex to the homestead, each chicken was properly instructed to respond to a peculiar call, and Finniken, Minniken, Winniken, Dump, Poog, Boog seemed to recognize immediately the queer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: ORIGINAL TEXT OF \"LITTLE BOY BLUE\" _With drawings in colors by Eugene Field._    The little toy dog is covered with dust     But sturdy and stanch he stands,   And the little toy soldier is red with rust     And his musket moulds in his hands.   Time was when the little toy dog was new     And the soldier was passing fair,   And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue     Kissed them and put them there.    \"Now, don't you go till I come,\" he said,     \"And don't you make any noise!\"   So, toddling off to his trundle-bed,     He dreamt of the pretty toys.

It was strong in his youth: it grew to be an imperative necessity in later life. In the theory that it is sometimes good to be alone he had little or no faith.\" From the time of Eugene's coming to Chicago until my marriage, in 1887, I was his closest comrade and almost constant companion. At the Daily News office, for a time, we shared the same room and then the adjoining rooms of which I have spoken. Field was known about the office as my \"habit,\" a relationship which gave point to the touching appeal which served as introduction to the dearly cherished manuscript copy, in two volumes, of nearly one hundred of his poems, which was his wedding gift to Mrs. Thompson. It was entitled, in red ink, \"Ye Piteous Complaynt of a Forsooken Habbit; a Proper Sonet,\" and reads:    _Ye boone y aske is smalle indeede     Compared with what y once did seeke--   Soe, ladye, from yr. bounteous meede     Y pray you kyndly heere mee speke.   Still is yr. Slosson my supporte,     As once y was his soul's delite--   Holde hym not ever in yr. courte--     O lette me have hym pay-daye nite!    One nite per weeke is soothly not     Too oft to leese hym from yr. chaynes;   Thinke of my lorne impoverisht lotte     And eke my jelous panges and paynes;   Thinke of ye chekes y stille do owe--     Thinke of my quenchlesse appetite--   Thinke of my griffes and, thinking so,     Oh, lette me have hym pay-daye nite!_  Along the border of this soulful appeal was engrossed, in a woful mixture of blue and purple inks: \"Ye habbit maketh mone over hys sore griffe and mightylie beseacheth the ladye yt she graunt hym ye lone of her hoosband on a pay-daye nite.\"  Through those years of comradeship we were practically inseparable from the time he arrived at the office, an hour after me, until I bade him good-night at the street-car or at his own door, when, according to our pact, we walked and talked at his expense, instead of supping late at mine. The nature of this pact is related in the following verse, to which Field prefixed this note: \"While this poem is printed in all the 'Reliques of Ye Good Knights' Poetrie,' and while the incident it narrates is thoroughly characteristic of that Knightly Sage, the versification is so different from that of the other ballads that there is little doubt that this fragment is spurious. Prof. Max Beeswanger (Book III., page 18, old English Poetry) says that these verses were written by Friar Terence, a learned monk of the Good Knight's time.\"    _THE GOOD KNIGHT TO SIR SLOSSON    The night was warm as summer     And the wold was wet with dew,       And the moon rose fair,       And the autumn air     From the flowery prairies blew;   You took my arm, ol' Nompy,     And measured the lonely street,       And you said, \"Let's walk       In the gloom and talk--     'Tis too pleasant to-night to eat!\"    And you quoth: \"Old Field supposin'     Hereafter we two agree;       If it's fair when we're through       I'm to walk with you--     If it's foul you're to eat with me!\"   Then I clasped your hand, ol' Nompy,     And I said: \"Well, be it so.\"       The night was so fine       I didn't opine     It could ever rain or snow!    But the change came on next morning     When the fickle mercury fell,       And since, that night       That was warm and bright     It's snowed or it's rained like--well.   Have you drawn your wages, Nompy?     Have you reckoned your pounds and pence?       Harsh blows the wind,       And I feel inclined     To banquet at your expense!_  The \"Friar Terence\" of Field's note was the Edward J. McPhelim to whom reference has already been made, who often joined us in our after-theatre symposiums, but could not be induced to walk one block if there was a street-car going his way.  As bearing on the nature of these \"banquets,\" and the unending source of enjoyment they were to both of us, the following may throw a passing light:    _Discussing great and sumptuous cheer   At Boyle's one midnight dark and drear       Two gentle warriors sate;   Out spake old Field: \"In sooth I reck   We bide too long this night on deck--   What, ho there, varlet, bring the check!       Egad, it groweth late!\"    Then out spake Thompson flaming hot:   \"Now, by my faith, I fancy not,       Old Field, this ribald jest;   Though you are wondrous fair and free   With riches that accrue to thee,   The check to-night shall come to me--       You are my honored guest!\"    But with a dark forbidding frown   Field slowly pulled his visor down       And rose to go his way--   \"Since this sweet favor is denied,   I'll feast no more with thee,\" he cried--   Then strode he through the portal wide       While Thompson paused to pay._  Speaking of \"the riches that accrued\" to Field it may be well to explain that when he came to Chicago from Denver he was burdened with debts, and although subsequently he was in receipt of a fair salary, it barely sufficed to meet his domestic expenses and left little to abate the importunity of the claims that followed him remorselessly. He lived very simply in a flat on the North Side--first on Chicago Avenue, something over a mile from the office, later on in another flat further north, on La Salle Avenue, and still later, and until he went to Europe, in a small rented house on Crilly Place, which is a few blocks west of the south end"]]]
