On a rainy afternoon in March, 1905, there entered the writer's office in the Criminal Courts Building, New York City, a ruddy, stoutly-built man, dressed in homespun garments, accompanied by an attractive and vivacious little woman, who, while unable to speak a single word of English, had no difficulty in making it obvious that she had a story to tell of the most vital importance. An interpreter was soon found and the names of the visitors disclosed. The lady, who did the talking for both of them, introduced herself as Madame Valoie Reddon, of Bordeaux, and her companion as M. Emile Lapierre, landowner, of Monségur, They had come, she explained, from France to take possession of the inheritance Tessier. She was a personal friend of Madame Lapierre, and as the Tessiers had exhausted all their money in paying the expenses connected with securing the fortune, she, being a well-to-do gentlewoman, had come to their assistance, and for the last few months had been financing the enterprise on a fifteen per cent. basis. If Madame Lapierre was to receive ten million dollars, then, to be sure, Madame Reddon would have one million five hundred thouand dollars; but, of course, it was not for the money, but on account of friendship, that she was aiding them. I would understand that three years had elapsed since a certain distinguished General Pedro Suarez de Moreno had disclosed to the Lapierres the fact that Madame was the heiress to the greatest estate in America. M. Lapierre solemnly nodded confirmation as the lady proceeded. It was the one subject talked about in the Gironde and Bordeaux--that is, among those who had been fortunate enough to learn anything about it. And for three years the Tessiers, their wives, their sons' wives, and their connections, had been waiting to receive the glad tidings that the conspirators had been put to rout and the rightful heirs reinstated.  It was some time before the good lady succeeded in convincing her auditor that such a ridiculous fraud as she described had actually been perpetrated. But there was M. Lapierre and there was Madame Valerie Reddon sitting in the office as living witnesses to the fact. What wonderful person could this General Moreno be, who could hypnotize a hard-headed, thrifty farmer from the Gironde and a clever little French woman from Bordeaux into believing that five hundred million dollars was waiting for them on the other side of the Atlantic! I expressed my surprise. Madame Reddon shrugged her sloping shoulders. Well, perhaps it was hard for M'sieu' to believe, but then there were the proofs, the documents, the _dossier_, and, most of all, there was the General himself. Oh' if M'sieu' could see the General in his tall silk hat and gold-headed cane!  I asked for the documents. Madame Reddon opened her bag and produced a package of nearly one hundred letters, written in a fine Spanish hand. Oh! he had been a wonderful writer, this gorgeous Count de Tinoco and Marquis de la d'Essa. She had met him herself when he had been in Bordeaux. Madame Lapierre had introduced him to her, and she had heard him talk. How beautifully he talked! The stories of his experiences as General of the armies of Spain under Don Carlos and as Brigadier-General in the Philippines were as fascinating as a romance. But it was his letters which had really led her to take a personal interest in the undertaking. With a sigh Madame Valoie untied the little blue ribbon which bound up the pitiful little history. If M'sieu' would be good enough to grant the time she would begin at the beginning. Here was his first letter written after the General's return to America:      _June 25, '02._      My dear M. Lapierre:      We have had a terrible voyage. A horrible storm broke loose in     mid-ocean, endangering all our lives.... The waves, like mountains,     threatened every instant to swallow us all; the spectacle was     terrifying. I fell from the top of the stairs 'way down into the     hole (_sic_), hurting my right leg in the centre of the tibia bone.     The ship's doctor, who is nothing but a stupid fool, left me     helpless almost the entire day.... If ever I should have dreamt what     would occur to me in this trip, not for all the gold in the world     would I have embarked. But, now that I am here, I shall not retreat     before any obstacle, in order to arrive at the fulfillment of my     enterprise, and no matter at what cost, even at that of my life. It     is necessary that I succeed--my pride demands it. Those who are in     the right shall triumph, that is sure.... In the mean time, will you     kindly give my regards to Madame and your son, and all of your     relatives, not forgetting your good old servant. Squeezing your hand     cordially, I bid you adieu.      Your devoted,      Pedro S. de Moreno.  \"Can you not see the waves, and observe him falling down the hole?\" asks Madame Reddon,  \"Mais, voici une autre.\"      _July 11, 1902._      M. Jean Lapierre.      _My dear M. Lapierre_: As soon as I could walk a little I began my     research for the impostors of the inheritance Tessier. Without a     doubt some person who is interested in the case has already advised     them of my arrival in New York, and to take the necessary     precautions to lead me astray in my researches.      Already I have discovered almost everything. I know even the house     in which resided the deceased before his death. It is a house of     twenty-five stories high, which resembles the Church of Saint     Magdalene in Paris. To-day it is the biggest bank in New York. I     have visited it from top to bottom, ascending and descending in     steel elevators. This is a marvelous palace; it is worth more than     five million dollars. The house itself has the numbers 100, 102,     104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116 and 118. In other words, it covers     the ground of ten other houses made into one.      I have also visited six houses belonging to him, which are worth     millions and are located around Central Park....      As soon as the brothers Lespinasse knew that I had arrived in New     York they immediately took their departure, one for Paris to find     his father, Emmeric Lespinasse, the other to the city of Tuxpan, in     Mexico, to visit the properties stolen from the heirs. I have come     to an understanding with the Reverend Father Van Rensselaer, Father     Superior of the Jesuits, and have offered him two millions for his     poor, in recompense for his aid to recover and to enter into     possession of the inheritance. He takes great pains, and is my     veritable guide and confidant....      I have visited Central Park, also a property of the deceased; this     property alone is worth more than twenty million dollars.... I have     great confidence in my success, and I am almost sure to reach the     goal, if you are the heirs, for here there is a mix-up by all the     devils....      The wound of my leg has much improved, the consequences which I     feared have disappeared, and I expect soon my complete     convalescence, but the devil has bestowed upon me a toothache, which     makes me almost crazy with pain. I shall leave, nevertheless, to     begin my campaign.      Will you be kind enough to give my regards to your wife and son, and     to our old friend, etc., etc.      PEDRO S. DE MORENO.  \"May the devil bestow upon him five hundred million toothaches!\" exclaims Lapierre, for the first time showing any sign of animation.  The other letters were read in their order, interspersed with Madame Reddon's explanations of their effect upon the heirs in France. His description of the elevators of steel and of the house that covered an entire block had caused a veritable sensation. Alas! those wonders are still wonders to them, and they still, I fancy, more than half believe in them. The letters are lying before me now, astonishing emanations, totally ridiculous to a prosaic American, but calculated to convince and stimulate the imagination of a _petit bourgeois_.  The General in glowing terms paints his efforts to run down the Lespinasse conspirators. Although suffering horribly from his fractured tibia (when he fell into the \"hole\"), and from other dire ills, he has \"not taken the slightest rest.\" He has been everywhere--\"New Orleans, Florida, to the city of Coney Island\"--to corner the villains, who \"flee in all directions.\" The daughter, Marie Louise, through whom the General expects to secure a compromise, has left for New Orleans. \"Wonderful coincidence,\" he writes, \"they were all living quietly and I believe had no intention whatever to travel, and two days after my arrival in New York they all disappeared. The most suspicious of it all is that the banker, his wife and children had left for Coney Island for the summer and to spend their holidays, and certainly they disappeared without saying good-by to their intimate friends.... I have the whole history of Tessier's life and how he made his fortune. There is a family for the use of whom we must give at least a million, for the fortune of Tessier was not his alone. He had a companion who shared his troubles and his work. According to the will they were to inherit one from the other; the companion died, and Tessier inherited everything. I do not see the necessity of your trip to New York; that might make noise and perhaps delay my negotiations.\" Then follows the list of properties embraced in the inheritance:  PROPERTY AND PERSONAL ESTATE OF THE HEIRS  1   The land of Central Park ceded to the     city of New York, of the value of             $5,000,000.00  2   He had at the National Bank--United     States Bank--deposited in gold--twenty     to thirty million dollars.

The letters continue: The General is surrounded by enemies, of which the worst are French, and he is forced continually to change his residence in order to escape their machinations. But all this takes money. How can he go to Tuxpan or to the city of Coney Island? \"You cannot know nor imagine the expense which I have had to discover that which I have discovered. I cannot live here like a miser, for the part I represent demands much of me. Every moment I change my residence, and that costs money.\" He adds a little touch of detail. \"I must always be dressed properly, and laundry is very dear here--a shirt costs twenty-five cents to wash, and there are other necessary expenses.... You have forgotten to tell me if you have received the album of views of New York in which I have indicated the properties of the deceased, I squeeze your hand.\"  \"Yes, and our purses too,\" adds Madame Valoie. \"Would M'sieu' care to see the album of the Tessier properties? Yes? M'sieu' Lapierre, kindly show the gentleman.\"  Lapierre unbuttons his homespun coat and produces a cheap paper-covered blank book in which are pasted small photographs and woodcuts of various well-known New York buildings. It is hard not to smile.  \"M'sieu' will see,\" continues Madame Valoie, \"that the dream had something substantial about it. When we saw these pictures in Bordeaux we were on the point of giving up in despair, but the pictures convinced us that it was all true. Moreover, just at that time the General intimated that unless he had more money he might yield to the efforts of the Lespinasse family to buy him off.\"  Madame Valoie points vindictively to a certain paragraph in one of the letters: \"Of course they are convinced that I am not for sale, not for anything.... To my regret, my very great regret, I shall be forced to capitulate if you do not come to my aid and that quickly, for I repeat to you that my funds are all gone.\"  \"And here is his bill,\" continues Madame Valoie, producing a folded document composed of countless sheets of very thin paper, bound together at the edges by strips of heavier material. This, when unfolded, stretches entirely across the room and is seen to be composed of hundreds of typewritten items, of which the following may serve as illustrations:               EXPENSES IN NEW YORK  July 12, Train to New Orleans   ..........   $25.50 \"    16, Train to Florida       ...........  $ 2.50 \"     \"  Dinner on train        ...........  $ 2.00 \"    17, Hotel in Florida       ...........  $ 2.00 \"    18, Trip to Coney Island   ...........  $  .50 \"    19, Return to Florida      ...........  $  .50 \"    21, Return from Florida to New Orleans  $ 2.50 \"     \"    Laundry              ...........  $ 1.15 Dec.  3, Return to New York     ...........  $ 6.50 \"    24, Train to Vera Cruz     ...........  $57.50 Jan.  4, Trip to Tuxpan         ...........  $ 2.50 \"     5, Return to Vera Cruz    ...........  $ 2.50 \"     6, Sudden night trip to Halifax,          Nova Scotia, via Buffalo and          Niagara Falls          ...........  $50.50 \"    18, Laundry for three months .........  $ 5.00           Etc., etc.               EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES  To Agent Pushyt John, a meerschaum and amber     cigar-holder and pipe       ...........  $ 7.00 Tobacco jar of shell and silver ...........  $ 4.00 To Indian Peter South-Go, a watch, a suit,     and a pair of shoes         ...........  $16.50 To my general agent of confidential reports     for his daughter, a gold ring and a     feather fan                 ...........  $ 7.00 A necktie for himself and scarf pin in     gold and with stone for the necktie ...  $ 8.60 To the letter-carrier to bring me my     correspondence and not give it to any     one else when I should change address .  $ 4.00 Invitation to the Consul and his two     agents in Washington hotel  ...........  $12.00 Several invitations to cafés and saloons     to the Police Agents        ...........  $ 2.00 Invitations to old employees of Jean     Tessier, to tear from them the     declarations                ...........  $ 1.50 Barber expenses                 ...........  $11.50 Tobacco and matches, July to December,     three packages each week, ten cents     each                        ...........  $ 7.80 Changing hotels to lead astray the agents     of the impostors            ...........  $ 9.50           Etc., etc.   \"To obtain a collossal fortune as yours will be, it is necessary to spend money unstintingly and to have lots of patience. Court proceedings will be useless, as trickery and lies are necessary to get the best of the scoundrels. It is necessary also to be a scoundrel.\"  \"That he might well say,\" interpolates Lapierre. \"He succeed, _c'est sure_.\"  I rapidly glanced over the remaining letters. The General seems always to be upon the verge of compelling a compromise. \"I have already prepared my net and the meshes are tightly drawn so that the fish will not be able to escape.... For an office like this one needs money--money to go quickly from one place to another, prosecute the usurpers, not allow them an instant's rest. If they go to some city run after them at once, tire them with my presence and constantly harass them, and by this means compel them to hasten a compromise--\"  The General is meeting with superhuman obstacles. In addition to his enemies he suffers all sorts of terrible bodily afflictions. Whenever the remittances from the Lapierres do not arrive the difficulties and diseases increase.  At last, however, after an interval of two years, things took a turn for the better. A \"confidential representative\" of the conspirators--one \"Mr. Benedict-Smith\"--arrived to make a bona fide offer of one hundred and fifty million dollars in settlement of the case. The General writes at great length as to exactly in what proportion the money should be divided among the heirs. The thing is so near a culmination that he is greatly exercised over his shabby appearance.      I am without a son and too badly dressed to go before the banker in     the very likely case of his arrival here. Send me my baggage at once     with the first steamer, and mark each piece \"fragile.\" This is all.     My regards to Madame Lapierre and your son. I am cordially yours,     squeezing your hand.      PEDRO S. DE MORENO.  But the Lapierres and Tessiers, while not for an instant distrusting the honesty of the General, had become extremely weary of sending him money. Each heir felt that he had contributed enough toward the General's \"expenses and invitations.\" Even the one hundred and fifty millions within easy reach did not prompt immediate response.  About the same time an extraordinary messenger arrived at the Lapierre farm, purporting to come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and instructing Lapierre to repair immediately to Paris. The messenger explained that the presence of Lapierre was desired at the Ministry in connection with some investigation then in progress into the affairs of one Jean Tessier. Then the messenger departed as mysteriously as he had arrived.  Good M. Lapierre was highly excited. Here was indubitable evidence of the truth of the General's assertions. But, just as the latter had intended, perhaps, the worthy farmer jumped to the conclusion that probably the messenger from Paris had been sent by the conspirators.  \"At the last moment,\" wrote Lapierre to Moreno, \"I received from Paris a letter commanding me to go to the Ministry, and "]]]
