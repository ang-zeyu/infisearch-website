The rule holds good in everything in life's uncertain fight;   You'll find the winner can't go wrong, the loser can't go right.   You ride a slashing race, and lose--by one and all you're banned!   Ride like a bag of flour, and win--they'll cheer you in the Stand.     Waltzing Matilda        (Carrying a Swag.)      Oh! there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong,    Under the shade of a Coolabah tree;   And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,    “Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.”        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling,        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?       Waltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag--        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?    Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole,    Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee;   And he sang as he put him away in his tucker-bag,    “You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!”    Down came the Squatter a-riding his thorough-bred;    Down came Policemen--one, two, and three.   “Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag?    You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.”    But the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole,    Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree;   And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong,    “Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?”     An Answer to Various Bards      Well, I've waited mighty patient while they all came rolling in,   Mister Lawson, Mister Dyson, and the others of their kin,   With their dreadful, dismal stories of the Overlander's camp,   How his fire is always smoky, and his boots are always damp;   And they paint it so terrific it would fill one's soul with gloom,   But you know they're fond of writing about “corpses” and “the tomb”.   So, before they curse the bushland they should let their fancy range,   And take something for their livers, and be cheerful for a change.    Now, for instance, Mr. Lawson--well, of course, we almost cried   At the sorrowful description how his “little 'Arvie” died,   And we lachrymosed in silence when “His Father's Mate” was slain;   Then he went and killed the father, and we had to weep again.   Ben Duggan and Jack Denver, too, he caused them to expire,   And he went and cooked the gander of Jack Dunn, of Nevertire;   So, no doubt, the bush is wretched if you judge it by the groan   Of the sad and soulful poet with a graveyard of his own.    And he spoke in terms prophetic of a revolution's heat,   When the world should hear the clamour of those people in the street;   But the shearer chaps who start it--why, he rounds on them in blame,   And he calls 'em “agitators” who are living on the game.   But I “over-write” the bushmen!  Well, I own without a doubt   That I always see a hero in the “man from furthest out”.   I could never contemplate him through an atmosphere of gloom,   And a bushman never struck me as a subject for “the tomb”.    If it ain't all “golden sunshine” where the “wattle branches wave”,   Well, it ain't all damp and dismal, and it ain't all “lonely grave”.   And, of course, there's no denying that the bushman's life is rough,   But a man can easy stand it if he's built of sterling stuff;   Tho' it's seldom that the drover gets a bed of eider-down,   Yet the man who's born a bushman, he gets mighty sick of town,   For he's jotting down the figures, and he's adding up the bills   While his heart is simply aching for a sight of Southern hills.    Then he hears a wool-team passing with a rumble and a lurch,   And, although the work is pressing, yet it brings him off his perch.   For it stirs him like a message from his station friends afar   And he seems to sniff the ranges in the scent of wool and tar;   And it takes him back in fancy, half in laughter, half in tears,   To a sound of other voices and a thought of other years,   When the woolshed rang with bustle from the dawning of the day,   And the shear-blades were a-clicking to the cry of “Wool away!”    Then his face was somewhat browner and his frame was firmer set--   And he feels his flabby muscles with a feeling of regret.   But the wool-team slowly passes, and his eyes go sadly back   To the dusty little table and the papers in the rack,   And his thoughts go to the terrace where his sickly children squall,   And he thinks there's something healthy in the bush-life after all.   But we'll go no more a-droving in the wind or in the sun,   For our fathers' hearts have failed us and the droving days are done.    There's a nasty dash of danger where the long-horned bullock wheels,   And we like to live in comfort and to get our reg'lar meals.   For to hang around the townships suits us better, you'll agree,   And a job at washing bottles is the job for such as we.   Let us herd into the cities, let us crush and crowd and push   Till we lose the love of roving and we learn to hate the bush;   And we'll turn our aspirations to a city life and beer,   And we'll slip across to England--it's a nicer place than here;    For there's not much risk of hardship where all comforts are in store,   And the theatres are plenty and the pubs are more and more.   But that ends it, Mr. Lawson, and it's time to say good-bye,   We must agree to differ in all friendship, you and I;   So we'll work our own salvation with the stoutest hearts we may,   And if fortune only favours we will take the road some day,   And go droving down the river 'neath the sunshine and the stars,   And then return to Sydney and vermilionize the bars.     T.Y.S.O.N.      Across the Queensland border line    The mobs of cattle go;   They travel down in sun and shine    On dusty stage, and slow.   The drovers, riding slowly on    To let the cattle spread,   Will say:  “Here's one old landmark gone,    For old man Tyson's dead.”    What tales there'll be in every camp    By men that Tyson knew;   The swagmen, meeting on the tramp,    Will yarn the long day through,   And tell of how he passed as “Brown”,    And fooled the local men:   “But not for me--I struck the town,   And passed the message further down;    That's T.Y.S.O.N.!”    There stands a little country town    Beyond the border line,   Where dusty roads go up and down,    And banks with pubs combine.   A stranger came to cash a cheque--    Few were the words he said--   A handkerchief about his neck,    An old hat on his head.    A long grey stranger, eagle-eyed--    “Know me?  Of course you do?”    “It's not my work,” the boss replied,    “To know such tramps as you.”    “Well, look here, Mister, don't be flash,”     Replied the stranger then,   “I never care to make a splash,   I'm simple--but I've got the cash,    I'm T.Y.S.O.N.”    But in that last great drafting-yard,    Where Peter keeps the gate,   And souls of sinners find it barred,    And go to meet their fate,   There's one who ought to enter in,    For good deeds done on earth;   Such deeds as merit ought to win,    Kind deeds of sterling worth.    Not by the strait and narrow gate,    Reserved for wealthy men,   But through the big gate, opened wide,   The grizzled figure, eagle-eyed,    Will travel through--and then   Old Peter'll say:  “We pass him through;   There's many a thing he used to do,   Good-hearted things that no one knew;    That's T.Y.S.O.N.”     As Long as your Eyes are Blue      Wilt thou love me, sweet, when my hair is grey    And my cheeks shall have lost their hue?   When the charms of youth shall have passed away,    Will your love as of old prove true?    For the looks may change, and the heart may range,    And the love be no longer fond;   Wilt thou love with truth in the years of youth    And away to the years beyond?    Oh, I love you, sweet, for your locks of brown    And the blush on your cheek that lies--   But I love you most for the kindly heart    That I see in your sweet blue eyes.    For the eyes are signs of the soul within,    Of the heart that is leal and true,   And mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,    Just as long as your eyes are blue.    For the locks may bleach, and the cheeks of peach    May be reft of their golden hue;   But mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,    Just as long as your eyes are blue.     Bottle-O!      I ain't the kind of bloke as takes to any steady job;    I drives me bottle cart around the town;   A bloke what keeps 'is eyes about can always make a bob--    I couldn't bear to graft for every brown.   There's lots of handy things about in everybody's yard,    There's cocks and hens a-runnin' to an' fro,   And little dogs what comes and barks--we take 'em off their guard    And we puts 'em with the Empty Bottle-O!                Chorus--        So it's any “Empty bottles!  Any empty bottle-O!”        You can hear us round for a half a mile or so.        And you'll see the women rushing        To take in the Monday's washing       When they 'ear us crying, “Empty Bottle-O!”    I'm drivin' down by Wexford-street and up a winder goes,    A girl sticks out 'er 'ead and looks at me,   An all-right tart with ginger 'air, and freckles on 'er nose;    I stops the cart and walks across to see.   “There ain't no bottles 'ere,” says she, “since father took the pledge;”     “No bottles 'ere,” says I, “I'd like to know   What right you 'ave to stick your 'ead outside the winder ledge,    If you 'aven't got no Empty Bottle-O!”    I sometimes gives the 'orse a spell, and then the push and me    We takes a little trip to Chowder Bay.   Oh! ain't it nice the 'ole day long a-gazin' at the sea    And a-hidin' of the tanglefoot away.   But when the booze gits 'old of us, and fellows starts to “scrap”,    There's some what likes blue-metal for to throw:   But as for me, I always says for layin' out a “trap”     There's nothin' like an Empty Bottle-O!     The Story of Mongrel Grey      This is the story the stockman told,    On the cattle camp, when the stars were bright;   The moon rose up like a globe of gold    And flooded"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1317"],["title","Saltbush Bill, J. P. (#3)"],["body","plain with her mellow light.       We watched the cattle till dawn of day       And he told me the story of Mongrel Grey.         .    .    .    .    .    He was a knock-about station hack,    Spurred and walloped, and banged and beat;   Ridden all day with a sore on his back,    Left all night with nothing to eat.       That was a matter of every-day       Common occurrence to Mongrel Grey.    We might have sold him, but someone heard    He was bred out back on a flooded run,   Where he learnt to swim like a waterbird,--    Midnight or midday were all as one.       In the flooded ground he could find his way,       Nothing could puzzle old Mongrel Grey.    'Tis a special gift that some horses learn;    When the floods are out they will splash along   In girth-deep water, and twist and turn    From hidden channel and billabong.       Never mistaking the road to go,       For a man may guess--but the horses _know_.    I was camping out with my youngest son--    Bit of a nipper just learnt to speak--   In an empty hut on the lower run,    Shooting and fishing in Conroy's Creek.       The youngster toddled about all day,       And with our horses was Mongrel Grey.    All of a sudden the flood came down    Fresh from the hills with the mountain rain,   Roaring and eddying, rank and brown,    Over the flats and across the plain.       Rising and rising--at fall of night       Nothing but water appeared in sight!    'Tis a nasty place when the floods are out,    Even in daylight; for all around   Channels and billabongs twist about,    Stretching for miles in the flooded ground.       And to move was a hopeless thing to try       In the dark with the water just racing by.    I had to try it.  I heard a roar,    And the wind swept down with the blinding rain;   And the water rose till it reached the floor    Of our highest room, and 'twas very plain       The way the water was sweeping down       We must shift for the highlands at once, or drown.    Off to the stable I splashed, and found    The horses shaking with cold and fright;   I led them down to the lower ground,    But never a yard would they swim that night!       They reared and snorted and turned away,       And none would face it but Mongrel Grey.    I bound the child on the horse's back,    And we started off with a prayer to heaven,   Through the rain and the wind and the pitchy black,    For I knew that the instinct God has given       To guide His creatures by night and day       Would lead the footsteps of Mongrel Grey.    He struck deep water at once and swam--    I swam beside him and held his mane--   Till we touched the bank of the broken dam    In shallow water--then off again,       Swimming in darkness across the flood,       Rank with the smell of the drifting mud.    He turned and twisted across and back,    Choosing the places to wade or swim,   Picking the safest and shortest track,    The pitchy darkness was clear to him.       Did he strike the crossing by sight or smell?       The Lord that led him alone could tell!    He dodged the timber whene'er he could,    But the timber brought us to grief at last;   I was partly stunned by a log of wood,    That struck my head as it drifted past;       And I lost my grip of the brave old grey,       And in half a second he swept away.    I reached a tree, where I had to stay,    And did a perish for two days hard;   And lived on water--but Mongrel Grey,    He walked right into the homestead yard       At dawn next morning, and grazed around,       With the child on top of him safe and sound.    We keep him now for the wife to ride,    Nothing too good for him now, of course;   Never a whip on his fat old hide,    For she owes the child to that old grey horse.       And not Old Tyson himself could pay       The purchase money of Mongrel Grey.     Gilhooley's Estate        (A ballad concerning the amalgamation of the legal professions.)      Oh, Mr. Gilhooley he turned up his toes,    As most of us do, soon or late;   And Jones was a lawyer, as everyone knows,    So they took him Gilhooley's Estate.    Gilhooley in life had been living so free    'Twas thought his possessions were great,   So Jones, with a smile, says, “There's many a fee    For me in Gilhooley's Estate.”    They made out a list of his property fine,    It totalled a thousand-and-eight;   But the debts were nine hundred and ninety and nine--    The debts of Gilhooley's Estate.    So Mrs. Gilhooley says, “Jones, my dear man,    My childer have little to ait:   Just keep the expenses as low as you can    Against poor Gilhooley's Estate.”    But Jones says, “The will isn't clear in its terms,    I fear it will need some debate,   And the law won't allow me (attorneys are worms)    To appear in Gilhooley's Estate.”    So a barrister-man, with a wig on his head,    And a brief in his hand quite elate,   Went up to the Court where they bury the dead,    Just to move in Gilhooley's Estate.    But his Honor the Judge said, “I think that the joint    Legatees must be called to pro_bate_--   Ex parte Pokehorney is clear on the point--    The point of Gilhooley's Estate.    “I order a suit to be brought just to try    If this is correct that I state--   A nice friendly suit, and the costs, by and by,    Must be borne by Gilhooley's Estate.”    So Mrs. Gilhooley says, “Jones, you'll appear!    Thim barristers' fees is too great;   The suit is but friendly.”  “Attorneys, my dear,    Can't be heard in Gilhooley's Estate.”    From the Barristers' Court there's a mighty hurrah    Arises both early and late:   It's only the whoop of the Junior Bar    Dividing Gilhooley's Estate.     The Road to Hogan's Gap      Now look, you see, it's this way like,    You cross the broken bridge   And run the crick down till you strike    The second right-hand ridge.    The track is hard to see in parts,    But still it's pretty clear;   There's been two Injin hawkers' carts    Along that road this year.    Well, run that right-hand ridge along--    It ain't, to say, too steep--   There's two fresh tracks might put you wrong    Where blokes went out with sheep.    But keep the crick upon your right,    And follow pretty straight   Along the spur, until you sight    A wire and sapling gate.    Well, that's where Hogan's old grey mare    Fell off and broke her back;   You'll see her carcase layin' there,    Jist down below the track.    And then you drop two mile, or three,    It's pretty steep and blind;   You want to go and fall a tree    And tie it on behind.    And then you pass a broken cart    Below a granite bluff;   And that is where you strike the part    They reckon pretty rough.    But by the time you've got that far    It's either cure or kill,   So turn your horses round the spur    And face 'em up the hill.    For look, if you should miss the slope    And get below the track,   You haven't got the whitest hope    Of ever gettin' back.    An' half way up you'll see the hide    Of Hogan's brindled bull;   Well, mind and keep the right-hand side,    The left's too steep a pull.    And both the banks is full of cracks;    An' just about at dark   You'll see the last year's bullock tracks    Where Hogan drew the bark.    The marks is old and pretty faint    And grown with scrub and such;   Of course the track to Hogan's ain't    A road that's travelled much.    But turn and run the tracks along    For half a mile or more,   And then, of course, you can't go wrong--    You're right at Hogan's door.    When first you come to Hogan's gate    He mightn't show, perhaps;   He's pretty sure to plant and wait    To see it ain't the traps.    I wouldn't call it good enough    To let your horses out;   There's some that's pretty extra rough    Is livin' round about.    It's likely if your horses did    Get feedin' near the track,   It's goin' to cost at least a quid    Or more to get them back.    So, if you find they're off the place,    It's up to you to go   And flash a quid in Hogan's face--    He'll know the blokes that know.    But listen, if you're feelin' dry,    Just see there's no one near,   And go and wink the other eye    And ask for ginger beer.    The blokes come in from near and far    To sample Hogan's pop;   They reckon once they breast the bar    They stay there till they drop.    On Sundays you can see them spread    Like flies around the tap.   It's like that song “The Livin' Dead”     Up there at Hogan's Gap.    They like to make it pretty strong    Whenever there's a charnce;   So when a stranger comes along    They always holds a darnce.    There's recitations, songs, and fights--    A willin' lot you'll meet.   There's one long bloke up there recites,    I tell you--he's a treat.    They're lively blokes all right up there,    It's never dull a day.   I'd go meself if I could spare    The time to get away.         .    .    .    .    .    The stranger turned his horses quick.    He didn't cross the bridge;   He didn't go along the crick    To strike the second ridge;    He didn't make the trip, because    He wasn't feeling fit.   His business up at Hogan's was    To serve him with a writ.    He reckoned if he faced the pull    And climbed the rocky stair,   The next to come might find his hide   A land-mark on the mountain side,   Along with Hogan's brindled bull    And Hogan's old grey mare!     A Singer of the Bush      There is waving of grass in the breeze    And a song in the air,   And a murmur of myriad bees    That toil everywhere.   There is scent in the blossom and bough,    And the breath of the Spring   Is as soft as a kiss on a brow--    And Spring-time I sing.    There is drought on the land, and the stock    Tumble down in their tracks   Or follow--a tottering flock--    The scrub-cutter's axe.   While ever a creature survives    The axes shall swing;   We are fighting with fate for their lives--    And the combat I sing.     “Shouting” for a Camel      It was over at Coolgardie that a mining speculator,    Who was going"]]]
