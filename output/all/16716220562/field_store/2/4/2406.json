Carry them on and keep it up--   A flying race is the Melbourne Cup,    You must race and stay to win it;   And old Commotion, Victoria's pride,   Now takes the lead with his raking stride,   And a mighty roar goes far and wide--    “There's only Commotion in it!”    But one draws out from the beaten ruck   And up on the rails by a piece of luck    He comes in a style that's clever;   “It's Trident! Trident!  Hurrah for Hales!”    “Go at 'em now while their courage fails;”    “Trident! Trident! for New South Wales!”     “The blue and white for ever!”    Under the whip! with the ears flat back,   Under the whip! though the sinews crack,    No sign of the base white feather;   Stick to it now for your breeding's sake,   Stick to it now though your hearts should break,   While the yells and roars make the grand-stand shake,    They come down the straight together.    Trident slowly forges ahead,   The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red,    The pace is undiminished;   Now for the Panics that never fail!   But many a backer's face grows pale   As old Commotion swings his tail    And swerves--and the Cup is finished.         .    .    .    .    .    And now in my dream it all comes back:   I bet my coin on the Sydney crack,    A million I've won, no question!   “Give me my money, you hooked-nosed hog!   Give me my money, bookmaking dog!”    But he disappeared in a kind of fog,    And I woke with “the indigestion”.     The Gundaroo Bullock      Oh, there's some that breeds the Devon that's as solid as a stone,   And there's some that breeds the brindle which they call the “Goulburn Roan”;   But amongst the breeds of cattle there are very, very few   Like the hairy-whiskered bullock that they bred at Gundaroo.    Far away by Grabben Gullen, where the Murrumbidgee flows,   There's a block of broken countryside where no one ever goes;   For the banks have gripped the squatters, and the free selectors too,   And their stock are always stolen by the men of Gundaroo.    There came a low informer to the Grabben Gullen side,   And he said to Smith the squatter, “You must saddle up and ride,   For your bullock's in the harness-cask of Morgan Donahoo--   He's the greatest cattle-stealer that abides in Gundaroo.”    “Oh, ho!” said Smith, the owner of the Grabben Gullen run,   “I'll go and get the troopers by the sinking of the sun,   And down into his homestead to-night we'll take a ride,   With warrants to identify the carcase and the hide.”    That night rode down the troopers, the squatter at their head,   They rode into the homestead, and pulled Morgan out of bed.   “Now, show to us the carcase of the bullock that you slew--   The great marsupial bullock that you killed in Gundaroo.”    They peered into the harness-cask, and found it wasn't full,   But down among the brine they saw some flesh and bits of wool.   “What's this?” exclaimed the trooper--“an infant, I declare;”    Said Morgan, “'Tis the carcase of an old man native bear.   I heard that ye were coming, so an old man bear I slew,   Just to give you kindly welcome to my home in Gundaroo.    “The times is something awful, as you can plainly see,   The banks have broke the squatters, and they've broke the likes of me;   We can't afford a bullock--such expense would never do--   So an old man bear for breakfast is a treat in Gundaroo.”    And along by Grabben Gullen, where the rushing river flows,   In the block of broken country where there's no one ever goes,   On the Upper Murrumbidgee they're a hospitable crew,   But you mustn't ask for “bullock” when you go to Gundaroo.     Lay of the Motor-Car      We're away! and the wind whistles shrewd    In our whiskers and teeth;   And the granite-like grey of the road    Seems to slide underneath.   As an eagle might sweep through the sky,    So we sweep through the land;   And the pallid pedestrians fly    When they hear us at hand.    We outpace, we outlast, we outstrip!    Not the fast-fleeing hare,   Nor the racehorses under the whip,    Nor the birds of the air   Can compete with our swiftness sublime,    Our ease and our grace.   We annihilate chickens and time    And policemen and space.    Do you mind that fat grocer who crossed?    How he dropped down to pray   In the road when he saw he was lost;    How he melted away   Underneath, and there rang through the fog    His earsplitting squeal   As he went----  Is that he or a dog,    That stuff on the wheel?     The Corner Man      I dreamed a dream at the midnight deep,    When fancies come and go   To vex a man in his soothing sleep    With thoughts of awful woe--   I dreamed that I was a corner-man    Of a nigger minstrel show.    I cracked my jokes, and the building rang    With laughter loud and long;   I hushed the house as I softly sang    An old plantation song--   A tale of the wicked slavery days    Of cruelty and wrong.    A small boy sat on the foremost seat--    A mirthful youngster he;   He beat the time with his restless feet    To each new melody,   And he picked me out as the brightest star    Of the black fraternity.    “Oh father,” he said, “what _would_ we do    If the corner-man should die?   I never saw such a man--did you?    He makes the people cry,   And then, when he likes, he makes them laugh.”     The old man made reply--    “We each of us fill a very small space    In the great creation's plan,   If a man don't keep his lead in the race    There's plenty more that can;   The world can very soon fill the place    Of even a corner-man.”         .    .    .    .    .    I woke with a jump, rejoiced to find    Myself at home in bed,   And I framed a moral in my mind    From the words the old man said.   The world will jog along just the same    When its corner-men are dead.     When Dacey Rode the Mule      'Twas to a small, up-country town,    When we were boys at school,   There came a circus with a clown,    Likewise a bucking mule.   The clown announced a scheme they had    Spectators for to bring--   They'd give a crown to any lad    Who'd ride him round the ring.        And, gentle reader, do not scoff        Nor think a man a fool--       To buck a porous-plaster off        Was pastime to that mule.    The boys got on; he bucked like sin;    He threw them in the dirt,   What time the clown would raise a grin    By asking, “Are you hurt?”    But Johnny Dacey came one night,    The crack of all the school;   Said he, “I'll win the crown all right,    Bring in your bucking mule.”        The elephant went off his trunk,        The monkey played the fool,       And all the band got blazing drunk        When Dacey rode the mule.    But soon there rose a galling shout    Of laughter, for the clown   From somewhere in his pants drew out    A little paper crown.   He placed the crown on Dacey's head    While Dacey looked a fool;   “Now, there's your crown, my lad,” he said,    “For riding of the mule!”        The band struck up with “Killaloe”,        And “Rule Britannia, Rule”,       And “Young Man from the Country”, too,        When Dacey rode the mule.    Then Dacey, in a furious rage,    For vengeance on the show   Ascended to the monkeys' cage    And let the monkeys go;   The blue-tailed ape and chimpanzee    He turned abroad to roam;   Good faith!  It was a sight to see    The people step for home.        For big baboons with canine snout        Are spiteful, as a rule--       The people didn't sit it out        When Dacey rode the mule.    And from the beasts that made escape,    The bushmen all declare,   Were born some creatures partly ape    And partly native-bear.   They're rather few and far between,    The race is nearly spent;   But some of them may still be seen    In Sydney Parliament.        And when those legislators fight,        And drink, and act the fool,       Just blame it on that torrid night        When Dacey rode the mule.     The Mylora Elopement      By the winding Wollondilly where the weeping willows weep,   And the shepherd, with his billy, half awake and half asleep,   Folds his fleecy flocks that linger homewards in the setting sun,   Lived my hero, Jim the Ringer, “cocky” on Mylora Run.    Jimmy loved the super's daughter, Miss Amelia Jane McGrath.   Long and earnestly he sought her, but he feared her stern papa;   And Amelia loved him truly--but the course of love, if true,   Never yet ran smooth or duly, as I think it ought to do.    Watching with his slow affection once Jim saw McGrath the boss   Riding out by Jim's selection, looking for a station 'oss   That was running in the ranges with a mob of outlaws wild.   Old McGrath “Good day” exchanges--off goes Jim to see his child;    Says, “The old man's after Stager, which he'll find is no light job,   And to-morrow I will wager he will try and yard the mob.   Will you come with me to-morrow?  I will let the parson know,   And for ever, joy or sorrow, he will join us here below.    “I will bring my nags so speedy, Crazy Jane and Tambourine,   One more kiss--don't think I'm greedy--good-bye, lass, before I'm seen--   Just one more--God bless you, dearie!  Don't forget to meet me here,   Life without you is but weary; now, once more, good-bye, my dear.”         .    .    .    .    .    The daylight shines on figures twain   That ride across Mylora plain,   Laughing and talking--Jim and Jane.   “Steadily, darling.  There's lots of time,   Didn't we slip the old man prime!   I knew he'd tackle that Bowneck mob,   I reckon he'll find it too big a job.   They've beaten us all.  I had a try,   But the warrigal devils seem to fly.   That Sambo's a real good bit of stuff   No doubt, but not quite good enough.   He'll have to gallop the livelong day,   To cut and come, to race and stay.   I hope he yards 'em, 'twill do him good;   To see us going I don't think would.”    A turn in the road and, fair and square,   They meet the old man "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1317"],["title","Saltbush Bill, J. P. (#7)"],["body","there.   “What's up?”  “Why, running away, of course,”    Says Jim, emboldened.  The old man turned,   His eye with wild excitement burned.   “I've raced all day through the scorching heat   After old Bowneck:  and now I'm beat.   But over that range I think you'll find   The Bowneck mob all run stone-blind.   Will you go and leave the mob behind?   Which will you do?  Take the girl away,   Or ride like a white man should to-day,   And yard old Bowneck?  Go or stay?”    Says Jim, “I can't throw this away,   We can bolt some other day, of course,   Amelia Jane, get off that horse.   Up you get, Old Man.  Whoop, halloo.   Here goes to put old Bowneck through!”    Two distant specks on the mountain side,   Two stockwhips echoing far and wide.   Amelia Jane sat down and cried.         .    .    .    .    .    “Sakes, Amelia, what's up now?   Leading old Sambo, too, I vow,   And him dead beat.  Where have you been?   “Bolted with Jim!  What _do_ you mean?”    “Met the old man with Sambo licked   From running old Bowneck.”  “Well, I'm kicked--   Ran 'em till Sambo nearly dropped?   What did Jim do when you were stopped?   Did you bolt from father across the plain?   Jim made you get off Crazy Jane!   And father got on, and away again   The two of 'em went to the ranges grim.   Good boy, Jimmy!  Well done, Jim!   They're sure to get them now, of course,   That Tambourine is a spanking horse.   And Crazy Jane is good as gold.   And Jim, they say, rides pretty bold;   Not like your father, but very fair.   Jim will have to follow the mare.”    “It never was yet in father's hide   To best my Jim on the mountain-side.   Jim can rally, and Jim can ride.”    But here again Amelia cried.         .    .    .    .    .    The sound of a whip comes faint and far,   A rattle of hoofs, and here they are,   In all their tameless pride.   The fleet wild horses snort with fear,   And wheel and break as the yard draws near.   Now, Jim the Ringer, ride!   Wheel 'em! wheel 'em!  Whoa back there, whoa!   And the foam-flakes fly like the driven snow,   As under the whip the horses go   Adown the mountain side.   And Jim, hands down, and teeth firm set,   On a horse that never has failed him yet,   Is after them down the range.   Well ridden! well ridden! they wheel--whoa back!   And long and loud the stockwhips crack,   Their flying course they change,   “Steadily does it--let Sambo go!   Open those sliprails down below.   Smart! or you'll be too late.   They'll follow old Sambo up--look out!   Wheel that black horse--give Sam a clout.   They're in!  Make fast the gate.”         .    .    .    .    .    The mob is safely in the yard!   The old man mounts delighted guard.   No thought has he but for his prize.   Jim catches poor Amelia's eyes.   “Will you come after all? the job is done,   And Crazy Jane is fit to run   For a prince's life--now don't say no;   Slip on while the old man's down below   At the inner yard, and away we'll go.   Will you come, my girl?”  “I will, you bet,   We'll manage this here elopement yet.”         .    .    .    .    .    By the winding Wollondilly stands the hut of Ringer Jim.   And his loving little Meely makes a perfect god of him.   He has stalwart sons and daughters, and, I think, before he's done,   There'll be numerous “Six-fortys” taken on Mylora run.     The Pannikin Poet      There's nothing here sublime,   But just a roving rhyme,   Run off to pass the time,    With nought titanic in   The theme that it supports,   And, though it treats of quarts,   It's bare of golden thoughts--    It's just a pannikin.    I think it's rather hard   That each Australian bard--   Each wan, poetic card--    With thoughts galvanic in   His fiery soul alight,   In wild aerial flight,   Will sit him down and write    About a pannikin.    He makes some new-chum fare   From out his English lair   To hunt the native bear,    That curious mannikin;   And then when times get bad   That wandering English lad   Writes out a message sad    Upon his pannikin:    “Oh, mother, think of me   Beneath the wattle tree”    (For you may bet that he    Will drag the wattle in)   “Oh, mother, here I think   That I shall have to sink,   There ain't a single drink    The water-bottle in.”    The dingo homeward hies,   The sooty crows uprise   And caw their fierce surprise    A tone Satanic in;   And bearded bushmen tread   Around the sleeper's head--   “See here--the bloke is dead!    Now where's his pannikin?”    They read his words and weep,   And lay him down to sleep   Where wattle-branches sweep,    A style mechanic in;   And, reader, that's the way   The poets of to-day   Spin out their little lay    About a pannikin.     Not on It      The new chum's polo pony was the smartest pony yet--   The owner backed it for the Cup for all that he could get.   The books were laying fives to one, in tenners; and you bet               He was on it.    The bell was rung, the nags came out their quality to try,   The band played “What Ho! Robbo!” as our hero cantered by,   The people in the Leger Stand cried out, “Hi, Mister, Hi!               Are you on it?”    They watched him as the flag went down; his fate is quickly told--   The pony gave a sudden spring, and off the rider rolled.   The pony finished first all right, but then our hero bold               Was not on it.     The Protest      I say 'e _isn't_ Remorse!    'Ow do I know?   Saw 'im on Riccarton course    Two year ago!   Think I'd forget any 'orse?    _Course_ 'e's The Crow!    Bumper Maginnis and I,    After a “go”,   Walkin' our 'orses to dry,    I says, “Hello!   What's that old black goin' by?”     Bumper says “Oh!   That's an old cuddy of Flanagan's--    Runs as The Crow!”    Now they make out 'e's Remorse.    Well, but I _know_.   Soon as I came on the course    I says “'Ello!    'Ere's the old Crow.”    Once a man's seen any 'orse,    'Course 'e must know.   Sure as there's wood in this table,    I say 'e's The Crow.        (Cross-examined by the Committee.)    'Ow do I know the moke    After one sight?   S'posin' you met a bloke    Down town at night,   Wouldn't you know 'im again when you met 'im?    That's '_I'm_ all right!    What was the brand on 'is 'ide?    _I_ couldn't say,   Brands can be transmogrified.    That ain't the way--   It's the _look_ of a 'orse and the way that 'e moves    That I'd know any day.    What was the boy on 'is back?    Why, 'e went past   All of a minute, and off down the track.   --“The 'orse went as fast?”    True, so 'e did!  But, my eyes, what a treat!   'Ow can I notice the 'ands and the seat   Of each bumble-faced kid of a boy that I meet?    Lor'!  What a question to ast!        (Protest dismissed.)     The Scapegoat      We have all of us read how the Israelites fled   From Egypt with Pharaoh in eager pursuit of 'em,   And Pharaoh's fierce troop were all put “in the soup”    When the water rolled softly o'er every galoot of 'em.   The Jews were so glad when old Pharaoh was “had”    That they sounded their timbrels and capered like mad.   You see he was hated from Jordan to Cairo--   Whence comes the expression “to buck against faro”.    For forty long years, 'midst perils and fears   In deserts with never a tramline to follow by,   The Israelite horde went roaming abroad   Like so many sundowners out on the wallaby.   When Moses, who led 'em, and taught 'em, and fed 'em,   Was dying, he murmured “A rorty old hoss you are:   I give you command of the whole of the band”--   And handed the Government over to Joshua.         .    .    .    .    .    But Moses told 'em before he died,   “Wherever you are, whatever betide,   Every year as the time draws near   By lot or by rote choose you a goat,   And let the high priest confess on the beast   The sins of the people, the worst and the least.   Lay your sins on the goat!  Sure the plan ought to suit yer,   Because all your sins are “his troubles” in future.   Then lead him away to the wilderness black   To die with the weight of your sins on his back:   Of thirst let him perish alone and unshriven,   For thus shall your sins be absolved and forgiven!”    'Tis needless to say, though it reeked of barbarity,   This scapegoat arrangement gained great popularity.   By this means a Jew, whate'er he might do,   Though he burgled, or murdered, or cheated at loo,   Or meat on Good Friday (a sin most terrific) ate,   Could get his discharge, like a bankrupt's certificate.   (Just here let us note--_DID THEY CHOOSE THEIR BEST GOAT?_   It's food for conjecture; to judge from the picture   By Hunt in the Gallery close to our door, a   Man well might suppose that the scapegoat they chose   Was a long way from being their choicest Angora.   In fact I should think he was one of their weediest;   'Tis a rule that obtains, no matter who reigns,   When making a sacrifice, offer the seediest;   Which accounts for a theory known to my hearers   Who live in the wild by the wattle beguiled,   That a “stag” makes quite good enough mutton for shearers.)   Be that as it may, as each year passed away,   A scapegoat was led to the desert and freighted   With sin (the poor brute must have been overweighted)   And left there--to die as his fancy dictated.         .    .    .    .    .    The day it has come; with trumpet and drum,   With pomp and solemnity fit for the tomb,   They led the old billy-goat off to his doom:   On every hand a reverend band,   Prophets and preachers and elders stand   And the oldest rab_bi_, with a tear in his eye,   Delivers a sermon to all standing by.   (We haven't his name--whether Cohen or Harris, he   No doubt was the “poisonest” kind of a Pharisee.)   The sermon was marked by a deal of humility   And pointed the fact, with no end of ability,   That being a Gentile's no mark of gentility,   And, according to Samuel, would certainly d--n you well.   Then, shedding his coat, he approaches the goat   And, while a red fillet he carefully pins on him,   Confesses the whole of"]]]
