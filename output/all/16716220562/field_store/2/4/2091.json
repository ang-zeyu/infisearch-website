It didn't even occur to me that Jeannie would be in this neighborhood.\"  \"He lives close to the farm, too: he won't fail to do your errand.\"   When they had taken that precaution, Germain started the mare off at a trot, and Petit Pierre was so overjoyed that he did not notice at first that he had not dined; but as the rapid movement of the horse dug a pit in his stomach, he began, after a league or more, to yawn and turn pale, and at last confessed that he was dying of hunger.  \"Now he's beginning,\" said Germain. \"I knew that we shouldn't go far before monsieur would cry from hunger or thirst.\"  \"I'm thirsty, too!\" said Petit-Pierre.  \"Well, we will go to Mère Rebec's wine-shop at Corlay, at the sign of the _Break of Day_. A fine sign, but a poor inn! Come, Marie, you will drink a finger of wine too.\"  \"No, no, I don't need anything,\" she said, \"I'll hold the mare while you go in with the little one.\"  \"But now I think of it, my dear girl, you gave the bread you had for your luncheon to my Pierre, and you haven't had anything to eat; you refused to dine with us at the house, and did nothing but weep.\"  \"Oh! I wasn't hungry, I was too sad! and I promise you that I haven't the slightest desire to eat now.\"  \"We must force you to, little one; otherwise you'll be sick. We have a long way to go, and we mustn't arrive there half-starved, and ask for bread before we say good-day. I propose to set you the example, although I'm not very hungry; but I shall make out to eat, considering that I didn't dine very well, either. I saw you and your mother weeping, and it made my heart sick. Come, come, I will tie Grise at the door; get down, I insist upon it.\"  All three entered Mere Rebec's establishment, and in less than a quarter of an hour the stout, limping hostess succeeded in serving them an omelet of respectable appearance with brown-bread and light wine.  Peasants do not eat quickly, and Petit-Pierre had such an enormous appetite that nearly an hour passed before Germain could think of renewing their journey. Little Marie ate to oblige at first; then her appetite came, little by little; for at sixteen one cannot fast long, and the country air is an imperious master. The kind words Germain said to her to comfort her and give her courage also produced their effect; she made an effort to persuade herself that seven months would soon be passed, and to think how happy she would be to be at home once more, in her own village, since Père Maurice and Germain were agreed in promising to take her into their service. But as she was beginning to brighten up and play with Petit-Pierre, Germain conceived the unfortunate idea of telling her to look out through the wine-shop window at the lovely view of the valley, which they could see throughout its whole length from that elevation, laughing and verdant and fertile. Marie looked, and asked if they could see the houses at Belair from there.  \"To be sure,\" replied Germain, \"and the farm, and your house too. Look, that little gray speck, not far from the great poplar at Godard, just below the church-spire.\"  \"Ah! I see it,\" said the girl; and thereupon she began to weep again.  \"I did wrong to remind you of that,\" said Germain, \"I keep doing foolish things to-day! Come, Marie, my girl, let's be off; the days are short, and when the moon comes up, an hour from now, it won't be warm.\"  They resumed their journey, and rode across the great heath, and as Germain did not urge the mare, in order not to fatigue the girl and the child by a too rapid gait, the sun had set when they left the road to enter the woods.  Germain knew the road as far as Magnier; but he thought that he could shorten it by not taking the avenue of Chanteloube, but going by Presles and La Sépulture, a route which he was not in the habit of taking when he went to the fair. He went astray and lost a little more time before entering the woods; even then he did not enter at the right place, and failed to discover his mistake, so that he turned his back to Fourche and headed much farther up, in the direction of Ardentes.  He was prevented then from taking his bearings by a mist which came with the darkness, one of those autumn evening mists which the white moonlight makes more vague and more deceptive. The great pools of water which abound in the clearings exhaled such dense vapor that when Grise passed through them, they only knew it by the splashing of her feet and the difficulty she had in pulling them out of the mud.  When they finally found a straight, level path, and had ridden to the end of it, Germain, upon endeavoring to ascertain where he was, realized that he was lost; for Père Maurice, in describing the road, had told him that, on leaving the woods, he would have to descend a very steep hill, cross a very large meadow, and ford the river twice. He had advised him to be cautious about riding into the river, because there had been heavy rains at the beginning of the season, and the water might be a little high. Seeing no steep hill, no meadow, no river, but the level moor, white as a sheet of snow, Germain drew rein, looked about for a house, waited for some one to pass, but saw nothing to give him any information. Thereupon he retraced his steps, and rode back into the woods. But the mist grew denser, the moon was altogether hidden, the roads were very bad, the ruts deep. Twice Grise nearly fell; laden as she was, she lost courage, and although she retained sufficient discernment to avoid running against trees, she could not prevent her riders from having to deal with huge branches which barred the road at the level of their heads and put them in great danger. Germain lost his hat in one of these encounters, and had great difficulty in finding it. Petit-Pierre had fallen asleep, and, lying back like a log, so embarrassed his father's arms that he could not hold the mare up or guide her.  \"I believe we're bewitched,\" said Germain, drawing rein once more: \"for these woods aren't big enough for a man to lose himself in unless he's drunk, and here we have been riding round and round for two hours, unable to get out of them. Grise has only one idea in her head, and that is to go back to the house, and she was the one that made me go astray. If we want to go home, we have only to give her her head. But when we may be within two steps of the place where we are to spend the night, we should be mad to give up finding it, and begin such a long ride over again. But I don't know what to do. I can't see either the sky or the ground, and I am afraid this child will take the fever if we stay in this infernal fog, or be crushed by our weight if the horse should fall forward.\"  \"We mustn't persist in riding any farther,\" said little Marie. \"Let's get down, Germain; give me the child; I can carry him very well, and keep him covered up with the cloak better than you can. You can lead the mare, and perhaps we shall see better when we're nearer the ground.\"  That expedient succeeded only so far as to save them from a fall, for the fog crawled along the damp earth and seemed to cling to it. It was very hard walking, and they were so exhausted by it that they stopped when they at last found a dry place under some great oaks. Little Marie was drenched, but she did not complain or seem disturbed. Thinking only of the child, she sat down in the sand and took him on her knees, while Germain explored the neighborhood after throwing Grise's rein over the branch of a tree.  But Grise, who was thoroughly disgusted with the journey, jumped back, released the reins, broke the girths, and, kicking up her heels higher than her head some half-dozen times, by way of salutation, started off through the brush, showing very plainly that she needed no one's assistance in finding her way.  \"Well, well,\" said Germain, after he had tried in vain to catch her, \"here we are on foot, and it would do us no good if we should find the right road, for we should have to cross the river on foot; and when we see how full of water these roads are, we can be sure that the meadow is under water. We don't know the other fords. So we must wait till the mist rises; it can't last more than an hour or two. When we can see, we will look for a house, the first one we can find on the edge of the wood; but at present we can't stir from here; there's a ditch and a pond and I don't know what not in front of us; and I couldn't undertake to say what there is behind us, for I don't know which way we came.\"     VIII  UNDER THE GREAT OAKS   \"Oh! well, Germain, we must be patient,\" said little Marie. \"We are not badly off on this little knoll. The rain doesn't come through the leaves of these great oaks, for I can feel some old broken branches that are dry enough to burn. You have flint and steel, Germain? You were smoking your pipe just now.\"  \"I had them. My steel was in the bag on the saddle with the game I was carrying to my intended; but the cursed mare carried off everything, even my cloak, which she will lose or tear on all the branches.\" \"Oh! no, Germain; the saddle and cloak and bag are all there on the ground, by your feet. Grise broke the girths and threw everything off when she left.\"  \"Great God, that's so!\" said the ploughman; \"and if we can feel round and find a little dead wood, we can succeed in drying and warming ourselves.\"  \"That's not hard to do,\" said little Marie; \"the dead wood cracks under your feet wherever you step; but give me the saddle first.\"  \"What are you going to do with it?\"  \"Make a bed for the little one: no, not like that; upside-down, so he won't roll out; and it's still warm from the mare's back. Prop it up on each side with those stones you see there.\"  \"I don't see them! Your eyes are like a cat's, aren't they?\"  \"There! now that's done, Germain! Give me your cloak to wrap up his little feet, and I'll put mine "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12816"],["title","The Devil's Pool (#7)"],["body","his body. Look! isn't he as comfortable there as he would be in his bed? and feel how warm he is!\"  \"Yes, indeed! you know how to take care of children, Marie!\"  \"That doesn't take much magic. Now look for your steel in your bag, and I'll fix the wood.\"  \"That wood will never light, it's too damp.\"  \"You doubt everything, Germain! Why, can't you remember taking care of sheep and making big fires in the fields when it was raining hard?\"  \"Yes, that's a knack that children who tend sheep have; but I've been an ox-driver ever since I knew how to walk.\"  \"That's how you came to be stronger in your arms than clever with your hands. There's your fire all built; now you'll see if it won't burn! Give me the fire and a few dry ferns. Good! now blow; you're not weak-lunged, are you?\"  \"Not that I know of,\" said Germain, blowing like a forge-bellows. In a moment, the flame shot up, cast a red light at first, and finally rose in bluish flashes under the branches of the oaks, struggling with the mist, and gradually drying the atmosphere for ten feet around.  \"Now, I'll sit down beside the little one and see that no sparks fall on him,\" said the girl. \"You must throw on wood and keep the fire bright, Germain! we shall not catch cold or the fever here, I promise you.\"  \"Faith, you're a smart girl,\" said Germain, \"and you can make a fire like a little witch. I feel like a new man, and my courage is coming back to me; for, with my legs wet to the knees, and the prospect of staying here till daybreak in that condition, I was in a very bad humor just now.\"  \"And when one is in a bad humor, one never thinks of anything,\" rejoined little Marie.  \"And are you never in a bad humor, pray?\"  \"Oh! no, never! What's the use?\"  \"Why, it's of no use, that's certain; but how can you help it, when you have things to annoy you? God knows that you have plenty of them, poor child; for you haven't always been happy!\"  \"True, my poor mother and I have suffered. We have been unhappy, but we never lost courage.\"  \"I wouldn't lose courage for any work that ever was,\" said Germain; \"but poverty would grieve me, for I have never lacked anything. My wife made me rich, and I am rich still; I shall be as long as I work at the farm: that will be always, I hope; but every one has his own troubles! I have suffered in another way.\"  \"Yes, you lost your wife, and it was a great pity!\"  \"Wasn't it?\"  \"Oh! I cried bitterly for her, Germain, I tell you! for she was so kind! But let's not talk about her any more or I shall cry again; all my sorrows seem to be coming back to me to-day.\"  \"Indeed, she loved you dearly, little Marie; she thought a deal of you and your mother. What! you are crying! Come, come, my girl, I don't want to cry, you know--\"  \"But you are crying, Germain! You are crying, too! Why should a man be ashamed to cry for his wife? Cry on, don't mind me! I share that grief with you!\"  \"You have a kind heart, Marie, and it does me good to weep with you. But put your feet near the fire; your skirts are all damp, too, poor little girl! Let me take your place by the child, and do you warm yourself better than that.\"  \"I'm warm enough,\" said Marie; \"if you want to sit down, take a corner of the cloak; I am very comfortable.\"  \"To tell the truth, we're not badly off here,\" said Germain, seating himself close beside her. \"The only thing that troubles me now is hunger. It must be nine o'clock, and I had such hard work walking in those wretched roads, that I feel all fagged out. Aren't you hungry, too, Marie?\"  \"I? Not at all. I'm not used to four meals a day as you are, and I have been to bed without supper so many times, that once more doesn't worry me much.\"  \"Well, a wife like you is a great convenience; she doesn't cost much,\" said Germain, with a smile.  \"I am not a wife,\" said Marie artlessly, not perceiving the turn the ploughman's ideas were taking. \"Are you dreaming?\"  \"Yes, I believe I am dreaming,\" was Germain's reply; \"perhaps it's hunger that makes my mind wander.\"  \"What a gourmand you must be!\" she rejoined, brightening up a little in her turn; \"well, if you can't live five or six hours without eating, haven't you some game in your bag, and fire to cook it with?\"  \"The devil! that's a good idea! but what about the gift to my future father-in-law?\"  \"You have six partridges and a hare! I don't believe you need all that to satisfy your hunger, do you?\"  \"But if we undertake to cook it here, without a spit or fire-dogs, we shall burn it to a cinder!\"  \"Oh! no,\" said little Marie; \"I'll agree to cook it for you in the ashes so it won't smell of smoke. Didn't you ever catch larks in the fields, and haven't you cooked them between two stones? Ah! true! I forget that you never tended sheep! Come, pluck that partridge! Not so hard! you'll pull off the skin!\"  \"You might pluck another one to show me how!\"  \"What! do you propose to eat two? What an ogre! Well, there they are all plucked, and now I'll cook them.\"  \"You would make a perfect _cantinière_, little Marie; but unluckily you haven't any canteen, and I shall be reduced to drink water from this pool.\"  \"You'd like some wine, wouldn't you? Perhaps you need coffee, too? you imagine you're at the fair under the arbor! Call the landlord: liquor for the cunning ploughman of Belair!\"  \"Ah! bad girl, you're laughing at me, are you? You wouldn't drink some wine, I suppose, if you had some?\"  \"I? I drank with you to-night at La Rebec's for the second time in my life; but if you'll be very good, I will give you a bottle almost full, and of good wine too!\"  \"What, Marie, are you really a magician?\"  \"Weren't you foolish enough to order two bottles of wine at La Rebec's? You drank one with the boy, and I took barely three drops out of the one you put before me. But you paid for both of them without looking to see.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well, I put the one you didn't drink in my basket, thinking that you or the little one might be thirsty on the way; and here it is.\"  \"You are the most thoughtful girl I ever saw. Well, well! the poor child was crying when we left the inn, but that didn't prevent her from thinking more of others than herself! Little Marie, the man who marries you will be no fool.\"  \"I hope not, for I shouldn't like a fool. Come, eat your partridges, they are cooked to a turn; and, having no bread, you must be satisfied with chestnuts.\"  \"And where the devil did you get chestnuts?\"  \"That's wonderful, certainly! why, all along the road, I picked them from the branches as we passed, and filled my pockets with them.\"  \"Are they cooked, too?\"  \"What good would my wits do me if I hadn't put some chestnuts in the fire as soon as it was lighted? We always do that in the fields.\"  \"Now, little Marie, we will have supper together! I want to drink your health and wish you a good husband--as good as you would wish yourself. Tell me what you think about it!\"  \"I should have hard work, Germain, for I never yet gave it a thought.\"  \"What! not at all? never?\" said Germain, falling to with a ploughman's appetite, but cutting off the best pieces to offer his companion, who obstinately refused them, and contented herself with a few chestnuts. \"Tell me, little Marie,\" he continued, seeing that she did not propose to reply, \"haven't you ever thought about marrying? you're old enough, though!\"  \"Perhaps I am,\" she said; \"but I am too poor. You need at least a hundred crowns to begin housekeeping, and I shall have to work five or six years to save that much.\"  \"Poor girl! I wish Pere Maurice would let me have a hundred crowns to give you.\"  \"Thank you very much, Germain. What do you suppose people would say about me?\"  \"What could they say? everybody knows that I'm an old man and can't marry you. So they wouldn't imagine that I--that you--\"  \"Look, ploughman! here's your son waking up,\" said little Marie.     IX  THE EVENING PRAYER   Petit-Pierre had sat up, and was looking all about with a thoughtful expression.  \"Ah! the rascal never does anything else when he hears anybody eating!\" said Germain; \"a cannon-shot wouldn't wake him, but move your jaws in his neighborhood, and he opens his eyes at once.\"  \"You must have been like that at his age,\" said little Marie, with a mischievous smile. \"Well, my little Pierre, are you looking for the top of your cradle? It's made of green leaves to-night, my child; but your father's having his supper, all the same. Do you want to sup with him? I haven't eaten your share; I thought you would probably claim it!\"  \"Marie, I insist on your eating,\" cried the ploughman; \"I shan't eat any more. I am a glutton, a boor; you go without on our account, and it's not right; I'm ashamed of myself. It takes away my appetite, I tell you; I won't let my son have any supper unless you take some.\"  \"Let us alone,\" replied little Marie, \"you haven't the key to our appetites. Mine is closed to-day, but your Pierre's is wide open, like a little wolf's. Just see how he goes at it! Oh! he'll be a sturdy ploughman, too!\"  In truth, Petit-Pierre soon showed whose son he was, and, although he was hardly awake and did not understand where he was or how he came there, he began to devour. Then, when his hunger was appeased, being intensely excited as children generally are when their regular habits are interrupted, he exhibited more quick wit, more curiosity, and more shrewdness than usual. He made them tell him where he was, and when he learned that he was in the middle of a forest, he was a little afraid.  \"Are there naughty beasts in this forest?\" he asked his father.  \"No, there are none at all,\" was the reply. \"Don't be afraid.\"  \"Then you lied when you told me that the wolves would carry me off if I went through the big forest with you?\"  \"Do you hear this reasoner?\" said Germain in some embarrassment.  \"He is right,\" replied little Marie, \"you told him that; he has a good memory, and he remembers it. But you must understand, my little Pierre, that your father never lies. We passed the big forest"]]]
