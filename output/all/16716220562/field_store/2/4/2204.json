(To be sung to the tune of \"Ta-ra-ra, boom-de-ay.\")    Now's the time for Santa Claus;   Christmas comes with loud huzzas.   Hark! the bells! Oh, hear them ring!   Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling.    _Cho_.--Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling,   Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling,   Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling,   Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling.    See his prancing reindeer brave,   Hear him tell them to behave--   Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,   Comet, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen.--_Chorus_.    Yes, hurrah for Santa Claus!   Blow the trumpets, shout huzzas!   We'll be happy while we sing--   Ting-a-ling-ling ting-a-ling.--_Chorus_.          *       *       *       *       *  =Santa Claus is Coming.=  By MAUD L. BETTS.      (To be sung to the tune of \"Marching thro Georgia.\")    Santa Claus is coming--we shall welcome him with glee;   He'll hang a gift for every one upon the Christmas-tree;   He'll not forget a single child. How happy we shall be;       For Santa Claus is coming.    _Chorus_--   Hurrah! hurrah! for Christmas time is near;   Hurrah! hurrah! the time to all so dear;   We all shall hang our stockings up when Christmas eve is here.       For Santa Claus is coming.    But we must remember all that we must do our part;   Christmas is the time of times, to give with all our heart   We must always share our joys with those who have no part,       When Santa Claus is coming.          *       *       *       *       *  =Old Santa Claus.=  By M. NORA BOYLAN.      (To be sung to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle.\" The verses may     be given by a single voice, with the chorus by the school, or     selected voices on the platform.)    Old Santa Claus is a jolly man     Who brings us lots of toys, sir;   And none are happier Christmas time     Than little girls and boys, sir.    Have you not seen our Santa Claus,     With hair so snowy white, sir?   Just hang your stocking Christmas eve,--     He'll come that very night, sir.    And if you watch, perhaps you'll see     This friend in furs hid deep, sir.   But I have never seen him once--     I'm always fast asleep, sir.    _Chorus_--Santa Claus is jolly, sir;     Santa Claus is kind, sir;   Santa Claus on Christmas eve     Comes riding on the wind, sir.          *       *       *       *       *  =A Christmas-bell Drill.=  By ELLA M. POWERS.      (This drill may be given by eight little girls provided with     wands. At the top of each wand are tacked three streamers of     red, white, and blue ribbon or cambric. At the end of each     streamer a little tinkling bell is sewed. The children sing,     and wave wands in time to the music. The words may be sung to     the tune of \"Lightly Row.\")    Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,   Happy bells of Christmas time;   Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,     Christ the Lord is born.    Christ is born, our Saviour dear,   Joyous words we love to hear;   Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,     Christ the Lord is born.      (Between first and second verses, all march singing same tune     to \"Tra la la.\"--\"Tra la la,\" wands waving, up, down, right,     left, up, down, right left, throughout. Resume places and sing     second verse.)    Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,   Happy bells of Christmas time;   Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,   Glory be to God.    Let us carol sweetly then,   Peace on earth, good will to men;   Sweetly chime, sweetly chime,   Christ the Lord is born.      (All march out, singing, and waving wands.)          *       *       *       *       *  =The Snow Brigade.=  By MARIAN LODER.      (A winter drill for a dozen boys--in overcoats, earcaps,     bright-colored mufflers, mittens, etc. Each carries a big     snow-shovel. The stage should be spread with sheets and loose     cotton to represent snow. Boys come marching in single file,     shovels over shoulder, singing to the tune, \"_See the Farmer     in the Field_.\")    I.      We are the jolly Snow Brigade,     With our trusty shovels we make a raid.     And lustily we'll give you aid     On a frosty winter's morning.      _Chorus_.--He! he! ha! ha! ha!                He! he! ha! ha! ha!                He! he! ha! ha! ha!                   Ho! ho! ho!    II.    (_Beginning to shovel cotton_.)      We'll shovel your walk for fifteen cents,     We'll pile the snow against the fence,     We'll show you we are boys of sense     On a frosty winter's morning.--_Cho_.    III.    (_Rubbing noses_.)      Jiminy crack! our noses are cold!     Oh! Jack Frost is bad and bold!    (_Working harder than ever_.)      But little care we for the winter cold,     On a clear and frosty morning.--_Cho_.    IV.    _(Pointing to work_.)      Look at that; now what do you say?    (_Holding out hands to audience_)      Now, if you please, we'll take our pay.     Our work is done, it's time for play,     On a frosty winter's morning.--_Cho_.    (_Begin snowballing with the cotton, throwing balls into   audience and at each other_.)          *       *       *       *       *  =Christmas Stockings.=  By A.S. WEBBER.      (Six small girls and boys are needed for speaking, and any     even number of larger girls for singing. A boy leads each     division of the march, immediately followed by those who     speak.      An equal number enter from opposite sides as far back as     possible, pass in front to sides, back half-way, form     two lines across front, having the six who speak in front     (alternating boy and girl), and the larger pupils back of them     sing as they enter and until they are placed the chorus of     \"Birdies' Ball,\" beginning \"Tra la la la la.\" When in position     all sing the following two verses, air, \"Birdies' Ball.\" When     chorus is reached, let them keep time by resting weight on     right foot on first count, and at same time swinging left foot     over right, touch toe to floor, dipping body slightly on third     count, foot back in place on first count of next measure. Rest     weight on left foot and swing right foot over left, touching     right toe on third count, foot back in place on first count of     next measure, etc.)    Santa Claus on Christmas eve,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12974"],["title","Christmas Entertainments (#1)"],["body","     Means to give a gift to all,   Each a stocking we will hang,     Stockings big and stockings small.    _Chorus_.--Tra la la la, etc.    Santa Claus on Christmas eve     Comes with reindeer swift as air,   Early all must be in bed,     Leaving only stockings there.    _Chorus_.--Tra la la la, etc.      (A girl comes one step forward, bows, and speaks.)    I mean to hang on Christmas eve     A stocking of this size _(measures),_   Because I want a doll so big,     That sleeps and shuts its eyes.   To crowd it in a stocking small     Would surely not be wise.      (Pupil steps back in place and all sing the chorus, keeping     time as before.)    _2d Pupil_.--My stocking is the one I'll hang,     I know 'twill hold quite well,   About a hundred marbles more     Than's owned by Tommy Bell.   Of course I want some candy, too,     But the marbles are what tell.      (Steps back, and chorus is repeated as before.)    _3d Pupil_.--I mean to beg a stocking small     Of little sister Clare,   Because I want some things so small     They'll scarce be found e'en there.   I want a ring that has a stone,     And a pretty pin to wear.      (Chorus repeated as before.)    _4th Pupil_.--I've measured all the stockings round,     And think I'll hang up two,   Because I want a pair of skates,--     One stocking will not do.   Of course I want some sweets and things     To last the whole week through.    _Chorus, etc_.    _5th Pupil_.--My mamma's stocking I will hang,     'Twill so much better hold   A tea-set for my dolly dear,     All painted round with gold;   And dishes can't be squeezed, you know,     That's what I've oft been told.    _Chorus, etc_.    _6th Pupil_.--And I don't know just what to do,     Because I want, you see,   A hobby-horse that is so high,--     Now tell me, can it be,   Are stockings ever made so big     That one can hold all of me?    _Chorus, etc_.    _All sing_.--All we children love to hang   Stockings o'er the fireplace,     Wondering how our gifts can come   Nice and clean from such a place.    _Chorus_.--Tra la la la, etc.    Santa Claus is loved by all     Folks who are as big as we,   And for long before he comes     We can only sing for glee.    _Chorus_.--Tra la la la, etc      (When the chorus is partly sung, the leaders of the march lead     to opposite sides, others fall in line forward, pass in front     to rear along sides, pass at rear end to seats. Continue to     repeat the chorus till all are seated.)          *       *       *       *       *  =Christmas Children.=  By M. NORA BOYLAN.      (An acrostic for the primary grade. Each child wears a large     gilt star around his neck. As he begins to speak, he turns it     over, showing his letter on the reverse side.)    _All_: Happy children here we stand.     Bringing words of love;   For on this glad Christmas day     Christ came from above.    _First child_: C is for the Christ Who came     To this lowly earth.    _Second child_: H is for the harps that rang     At our Saviour's birth.    _Third child_: R is for the ringing bells,     Telling Christmas-tide.    _Fourth child_: I is for the crystal ice     Where we go to slide.    _Fifth child_: S is for the schoolboy's sled     When he coasting goes.    _Sixth child_: T is for poor Tommy Jones--     Jack Frost bit his nose.    _Seventh child_: M is for the merry part     Of this Christmas day,    _Eighth child_: A is for the apple pies     Grandma put away.    _Ninth child_: S is for old Santa Claus,     Coming here to-night.   Hope he'll wait till nearly morn,     So it will be light.    _All_: Yes, we're happy children nine,     And to each we're true,   Three cheers for jolly Santa Claus,     A happy day to you.          *       *       *       *       *  =Santa Claus.=  By W.S.C.      (A letter exercise for ten very small children. Let each child     present placard bearing the letter as he recites his line. At     the close, all shut their eyes and screw them up very tight.)

(Seven little girls daintily dressed carry a bell in the right     hand, with the initial on it which begins her line. The bells     are rung lightly during the speaking)      _First child_: Cheerily ring the Christmas bells!    _Second child_: How joyfully their jingling tells     _Third child_: All peace and kindness on the earth,    _Fourth child_: Ringing out, singing out, laughing with mirth!     _Fifth child_: In every home is joy profound,     _Sixth child_: The echo of this merry sound.   _Seventh child_: Yet Charity must remembered be,                         And that is why we have this tree.          *       *       *       *       *  =Merry Christmas.=  By M.D. STERLING.      (Seven boys and seven girls with good voices and some     sprightliness of manner are required. Each carries a wand,     to the upper end of which is fastened an evergreen wreath     surrounding a large, gilt letter. Ranged in order the letters     will spell the word \"Merry Christmas.\" The verse for each is     sung to the air, \"Buy a Broom.\" The children enter only one at     a time, using a polka step, boys and girls alternately. While     singing they take steps and wave wand in time to music. At     third line of each stanza the boys bow and the girls make a     courtesy, right and left. The chorus at the end of each verse     is sung by the entire school. The boy with letter M comes in     first, sings, and takes position on platform. He is followed     by the girl with E. So continue until the line of children is     complete.)    _First boy_:   M stands for merry--oh' let us be merry;     M stands for merry--right merry am I.   _(Bowing.)_ With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     Come, now, and be merry, all sadness defy.    _Chorus (by school, to the refrain of \"Buy a Broom_\").--    Christmas dear now draws near,   With song and with evergreen welcome it here.    _First girl_:   E stands for evergreen, beautiful evergreen,     E stands for evergreen, never to fade.   (_Courtesying.)_ With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     Bring evergreen garlands for Christmas time made.--_Cho_.    _Second boy_:   R stands for rollicking--come, then, be rollicking;     R stands for rollicking--fun's in the air!   With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     In Christmas-day rollicking take now a share.--_Cho_.    _Second girl_:   R stands for rally, a grand Christmas rally,     R stands for rally, where Christmas trees grow!   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     We rally where Santa is likely to go.--_Cho_.    _Third boy_:   Y stands for youthful--rejoice, now, all youthful;     Y stands for youthful--quite youthful am I.   With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     The youthful make merry when Christmas is nigh.--_Cho_.      (Leave a space in the line of children between the last letter     of \"Merry\" and the first of \"Christmas.\")    _Third girl_:   C stands for Christmas--bright Christmas, merry Christmas;     C stands for Christmas--the best of the year.   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     Make merry at Christmas with good Christmas cheer.--_Cho_.    _Fourth boy_:   H stands for happy--at Christmas be happy!     H stands for happy--right happy am I.   With a bow to the right sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     If you would be happy some Christmas gifts buy--_Cho_.    _Fourth girl_:   R stands for ready--for Christmas be ready;     R stands for ready--are _you_ ready yet?   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir.     To make ready for Christmas, oh! never forget.--_Cho_.    _Fifth boy_:   I stands for icy--for winter so icy;     I stands for icy, when Kris drives along.   With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     Though icy the weather we'll give him a song.--_Cho_.    _Fifth girl_:   S stands for Santa--the children's own Santa;     S stands for Santa, the jolly old dear.   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     For Santy to fill we hang stockings each year.--_Cho_.    _Sixth boy_:   T stands for thoughtful--of all friends be thoughtful;     T stands for thoughtful--your presents prepare.   With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir,     And be thoughtful those poorer than you have a share.--_Cho_.    _Sixth girl_:   M stands for magic--for Christmas-night magic;     M stands for magic filling stockings and tree.   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     Who does this fine magic, can any agree?--_Cho_.    _Seventh boy_:   A stands for all of us, old and young, all of us;     A stands for all of us looking for Kris.   With a bow to the right, sir, and a bow to the left, sir.    And all of us hope that not one will he miss.--_Cho_.    _Seventh girl_:   S stands for smiling--on Christmas morn smiling;     S stands for smiling--all smiling I'll be.   With a courtesy to right, sir, and a courtesy to left, sir,     All smiling, yes, smiling, when presents I see.--_Cho_.      (The following verses are to be sung by the school to the air,     \"Wait for the Wagon.\" During the singing of the first stanza     and chorus, the fourteen boys and girls divide off into     couples and march around, elevating and lowering the wands in     time to music. During the second stanza they form two opposite     lines, with wands crossed overhead,"]]]
