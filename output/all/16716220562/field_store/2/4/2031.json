Chocolate and rolls by all means, but help us out a bit.  What can we call for that is more hearty.\"  \"There are _tortillas_ to be had sometimes,\" the servant answered. \"Also, sometimes, _frijoles_.\"  \"They both sound good,\" Harry assented vaguely.  \"Bring us some.\"  \"_Caballeros_, you shall be served with the speed at which the eagle flies!\" exclaimed the servant.  With a separate bow to each he withdrew, softly closing the door after him.  \"Now Harry, let's hustle into some clothes,\" urged Tom.  \"Since we are to eat here mine clothes will be the thing.  Hustle into them!\"  Bred in the ways of the camps, ten minutes later Tom and Harry were washed, dressed and otherwise tidy in every respect.  \"I've a mind to go outdoors and get some glimpses of the scenery for a few minutes,\" Harry hinted.  \"Don't think of it.  You don't want to come back to a cold breakfast.\"  So both seated themselves, regretting the absence of morning newspapers.  Then the time began to drag.  Finally the delay became wearisome.  \"I wonder how many people Nicolas is serving this morning?\" murmured Hazelton, at last.  \"Everyone in the house would be my guess,\" laughed Tom.  Still time dragged by.  \"What on earth will Don Luis think of us?\" Harry grunted.  \"There is only one thing for it, if this delay lasts any longer,\" Tom answered.  \"If this delay lasts much longer we shall have to put off breakfast until to-morrow and get to work.\"  \"Put off breakfast until to-morrow?\" Hazelton gasped.  \"That's where I draw the line.  Before I'll stir a step from here I must have at least food enough to grubstake a canary bird.\"  Some minutes later, Nicolas rapped at the door.  He then entered, bearing a tray enveloped in snowy linen.  This tray he put down, then spread a tablecloth that he had brought over one arm.  \"Will you be seated, _caballeros_?\" he asked, respectfully, as he took his stand by the tray.  Then he whisked away the linen cover.  Gravely he set upon the table a pot of chocolate, two dainty cups and saucers and a plate containing four rolls.  \"Where's the butter, Nicolas?\" asked Harry.  \"Butter, _caballero_?  I did not understand that you wished it. I will get it.  I will run all the way to the kitchen and back.\"  \"Never mind the butter this morning, Nicolas,\" spoke up Tom, at the same time kicking Harry gently under the table.  \"Can I serve you further, now, _caballeros_\" inquired Nicolas, with great respect, \"or shall I bring you the remainder of your breakfast?\"  \"Bring us the rest of the breakfast, by all means,\" begged Harry, and the servant left them.  \"Why did you tell him not to mind the butter?\" grunted Hazelton.  \"Because,\" Tom answered, \"it struck me that, in Mexico, it may not be customary to serve butter in the morning.\"  Harry took a bite of one of the rolls, finding it to be soft, flaky and delicious.  Then he removed another linen covering from the pot and started to pour the chocolate.  That beverage did not come as freely as he had expected.  \"What ails the stuff?\" grunted Hazelton.  \"This isn't the first of April.\"  Then Harry removed the lid from the pot, glancing inside, next he picked up a spoon and stirred the contents of the pot.  \"I wish Nicolas were here,\" said Hazelton.  \"Why?\" Tom wanted to know.  \"I'm bothered about what's etiquette in Mexico.  I don't know whether it's right to eat this stuff with a knife, or whether we're expected to spread the stuff on the rolls.\"  \"It is pretty thick stuff,\" Tom agreed, after taking a look. \"But let me have the pot and the spoon.  I think I can manage it.\"  After some work Tom succeeded in reducing the chocolate to a consistency that admitted of pouring, though very slowly.  \"It took you almost three minutes to pour two cups,\" said Harry, returning his watch to his pocket.  \"Come on, now!  We've got to make up for lost time.  What will Don Luis think of us?  And yet it is his household arrangements that are keeping us away from our work.\"  Chocolate and rolls were soon disposed of.  Then the two engineers sat back, wondering whether Nicolas had deserted them.  Finally, both rose and walked to stretch their legs.  \"No restaurant in New York has anything on this place for slow-march service!\" growled Hazelton.  As all things must come at last, so did Nicolas.  He carried a tray and was followed by a second servant, bringing another.  The _tortillas_ proved to be, as Harry put it, \"a cross between a biscuit and flapjack.\"  The _frijoles_ were just plain boiled beans, which had evidently been cooked on some other day, and were now mushy.  But it was a very solid meal that now lay before them, and the young engineers ate heartily.  \"Will the _caballeros_ have some more chocolate?\" suggested Nicolas.  \"Not now,\" said Hazelton.  \"But you might order some for to-morrow's breakfast, and then we shan't have to wait for so long next time.\"  The additional servant had gone, noiselessly, but Nicolas hovered about, silently.  At last the meal was finished.  Tom had chewed his food thoroughly, what he had eaten of it, but Harry, in his hunger, had eaten hurriedly.  \"Now we'll have to find Don Luis and apologize,\" hinted Tom. \"Hereafter I can see that we shall have to rise much earlier. Confound it, it's a quarter of nine, already.\"  The two youngsters hastened out to the veranda.  A man servant was lazily dusting and placing porch chairs.  \"Has Don Luis gone to the mine?\" asked Tom in Spanish.  \"Don Luis?\" repeated the servant, in evident astonishment.  \"Presently his excellency will be dressing.\"  \"Thank you,\" nodded Tom, and paced the veranda, leisurely.  \"Harry, we didn't make such a bad break after all, then.  Plainly Don Luis didn't plan an early start.\"  \"Is Dr. Tisco around?\" asked Harry, of the servant.  \"The learned doctor must be dressing by this time, _caballero_,\" replied the servant respectfully.  \"Hm!\" mused Harry.  \"Can it be that the people in Bonista do their work at night?\"  \"Oh, I'll wager the poor _peons_ at the mine have been at work for some time,\" Tom smiled.  \"Anyway, I'm glad we haven't kept everyone else waiting.\"  At half-past ten o'clock Dr. Tisco appeared, immaculate in white. He bowed low and courteously to the guests.  \"I trust, _caballeros_, that you have enjoyed perfect rest.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Harry.  \"And now we're fidgeting to get at work. But, of course, we can't start for the mine until Don Luis gives us the word, and we are at his pleasure.\"  \"It is nearly time for Don Luis to appear,\" said Tisco gravely.  \"Is he always as late as this?\"  \"Here, Senor Hazelton, we do not call eleven o'clock a late hour for appearing.\"  Twenty minutes later Don Luis appeared, clad in white and indolently puffing at a Mexican cigarette.  \"You will smoke, gentlemen?\" inquired their host, courteously, after he had inquired concerning their rest.  \"Thank you,\" Tom responded, pleasantly.  \"We have never used tobacco.\"  Don Luis rang and a servant appeared.  \"Have one of my cars ordered,\" commanded Don Luis.  Ten minutes later a car rolled around to the entrance.  \"You will come with us, Carlos?\" inquired Don Luis.  \"Assuredly, Don Luis,\" replied the secretary, in the tone of a man who was saying that he would not for worlds miss an expected treat.  It was a seven-passenger car of late design.  Into the tonneau stepped the two Mexicans and the two young engineers.  \"To the mines,\" ordered Don Luis.  \"Do you wish speed, excellency?\" inquired the chauffeur.  \"No; we will go slowly.  We may wish to talk.\"  Gravely, in military fashion, the chauffeur saluted, then allowed the automobile to roll slowly away.  \"It is not an attractive road, after we leave the _hacienda_,\" explained Don Luis Montez to Tom.  \"It is a dusty road, and a somewhat hard one.  The mining country is not a beautiful place in which to live.\"  \"It is at least more beautiful than the country in which our mine is located,\" Tom replied.  \"Are you gentlemen, then, mine owners as well as mine experts?\" inquired their host.  Tom told Don Luis briefly about their mine, the Ambition, in the Indian Smoke Range, Nevada.  \"And is your mine a profitable one?\" inquired the Mexican.  \"It hasn't made us millionaires,\" Tom rejoined, modestly, \"but it pays us more money, every month, than we really need.\"  Don Luis glanced covertly at his secretary, with a look that conveyed:  \"If these young Gringos have all the money they want, and more, then we may find it difficult to appeal to their avarice.\"  Dr. Tisco's return glance as much as said:  \"I am all the more certain that we shall find them difficult.\"  Don Luis commented to the two young men on the country through which they were passing.  Finally the car drew up before the entrance to _El Sombrero_ Mine.  There was the shaft entrance and near it a goodly-sized dump for ore.  Not far from the entrance was a small but very neat looking office building, and a second, still smaller, which might have been a timekeeper's office.  \"Hello, Pedro!\" called Don Luis.  Out of the office building sprang a dark-featured Mexican, perhaps forty years of age.  He was truly a large man--more than six feet in height, broad of shoulder and deep of chest, a splendid type of manhood.  \"My good Gato,\" purred Don Luis, \"pay your respects to _Los Caballeros_ Reade and Hazelton.\"  Gato approached, without offering his hand.  His big, wolfish eyes looked over the young American pair keenly.  \"So Don Luis has brought you here to show whether you are any good?\" said the mine manager, in a voice as big as his frame.  \"I shall soon know.\"  Before the big, formidable manager Harry Hazelton remained silent, while Don Luis and his secretary slid softly into the office building.  \"Gato, just what do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#4)"],["body","mean by your remark?\" asked Tom Reade, very quietly.  \"I mean that I shall put you at work and find out what you can do,\" leered the mine manager.  \"Mistake number one!\" rejoined Tom coolly.  \"I do not understand that you have any authority to give us orders.\"  \"You shall soon learn, then!\" growled the man.  \"I am the mine manager here.\"  \"And we are the engineers about to be placed in charge,\" Tom continued. \"If we stay, Gato, you will assist us in all ways that you can. Then, when you have received our instructions you will carry them out according to the best of your ability.\"  The two looked each other sternly in the eyes, Pedro Gato appearing as though he enjoyed young Americans better than any other food in the world.  Indeed, he might have been expected to eat one of them right then and there.  Behind a shade in the office building Dr. Tisco stirred uneasily.  \"What did I say to you, Don Luis?\" inquired the secretary.  \"Did I not suggest that these Gringos would not be easily controlled?\"  \"Wait!\" advised Don Luis Montez.  \"Wait!  You have not yet seen what my Gato will do.  He is not a baby.\"  \"These Gringos will balk at every hour of the day and night,\" predicted Dr. Tisco.  \"Wait until you have seen my good Gato tame them!\" chuckled Don Luis, softly.     CHAPTER III  GATO STRIKES THE UP TRAIL   \"When you speak to me, Gringo,\" bellowed Pedro Gato, \"you will--\"  \"Stop, Greaser!\" shot back Tom, sternly, though he did not even stir or raise his hands.  \"Greaser?\" bellowed Pedro Gato.  \"That is foul insult!\"  \"Not more so than to call me a Gringo,\" Tom Reade went on coolly. \"So we are even, though I feel rather debased to have used such a word.  Gato, if you make the mistake, again, of using an offensive term when addressing me, I shall--well, I may show a somewhat violent streak.\"  \"You?\" sneered Gato.  Then something in the humor of the situation appealed to him.  He threw back his head and laughed loudly.  \"Gringo,\" he began, \"you will--\"  \"Stop that line of talk, fellow,\" commanded Tom quietly.  \"When you address me, be good enough to say either 'senor' or 'sir.' I am not usually as disagreeable as this in dealing with my fellow men, but you have begun wrong with us, Gato, and the first thing you'll have to learn to do will be to treat us with proper courtesy.\"  From the shaft entrance showed the faces of four grinning, wondering Mexicans of the usual type.  The talk had proceeded in Spanish, and they had been able to follow it.  As for the mine manager, his bronzed face was distorted with rage. The veins near his forehead were swelling.  With a sudden roar, Pedro Gato sprang forward, aiming a blow with his open right hand at Reade's face.  Bump!  That blow failed to land.  It was Gato, instead, who landed. He went down on his back, striking the ground with jarring force.  \"What did I say?\" whispered Dr. Tisco.  \"Wait!\" responded Don Luis, with a shrug of his shoulders.  Well-nigh frothing at the mouth, Pedro Gato leaped to his feet. All was red now before his eyes.  He rushed forward bellowing like a bull, intent on crushing the young American who had dared to treat him thus.  Tom's left fist drove into the fellow's unguarded face.  His right followed, and Gato, big as he was, staggered back.  Tom's right foot performed a trip that sent the big Mexican bully to earth again.  \"Now get up, Gato, like a man of intelligence, and behave yourself,\" advised Reade coolly.  \"Just because we have had a bad introduction is no reason why we should continue enemies.  You treat me with proper respect and I'll do as much for you.\"  But Gato snarled like a wild beast.  He was not armed.  With every man in these Bonista mountains afraid of him, Gato had never felt the need of carrying weapons.  But now he plunged to the doorway of the shaft house, then came bounding back, flourishing a knife that he had snatched from one of the _peons_.  \"Back!  Back, Gato!\" shouted Dr. Tisco, rushing from the office building.  To the secretary Gato paid no heed.  He was close to Tom now, circling cautiously around the young engineer.  Harry, though not at all minded to bolt, had stepped back far enough to give Reade elbow room.  \"Stop, Gato!\" shouted Don Luis.  \"It is I who command it--I, Don Luis.  Throw your knife on the ground.\"  Gato snarled, but he was cowed.  The brutal manager held his employer in awe.  He was about to cast his weapon down when Tom Reade interposed.  \"Don Luis, I ask you to let the fellow go on.  This question will have to be settled right before we can proceed.  This fellow is only a coward, or he wouldn't need a knife in fighting with a man half his size.\"  \"Better throw away your knife, my good Gato,\" purred Don Luis, \"or Senor Reade will shoot you.\"  \"I won't,\" Tom retorted.  \"I couldn't, anyway.  I am not armed. I never was enough afraid of any one to carry weapons.  But let Gato go on with his knife.  If he fails, then I shall hit him until my arm aches.\"  \"Stop, Senor Reade!  I command it!\" cried Don Luis, imperiously. \"And you, Gato, throw down your knife.  I will not have fighting here among men who must be friends.\"  But Gato, after hearing himself described as a coward, saw only red before his eyes.  He must have this Gringo's life, and that quickly.  Afterwards he would explain and seek Don Luis's pardon.  \"If you prefer, Gato, we will shake hands and forget this,\" suggested Tom Reade.  \"Ah, so you are afraid?\" sneered the mine manager.  \"Try me and see, if you prefer that,\" Tom retorted.  With a snarl Gato circled closer.  Don Luis Montez snatched from one of his pockets a silver-mounted revolver, but Hazelton caught the flash and in the next instant he had wrenched the pistol away from the mine owner.  \"This is Reade's fight, Don Luis,\" Harry explained.  \"Hand back my pistol instantly,\" hissed Don Luis.  \"Not until the fight is decided, Don Luis,\" Harry rejoined.  Slipping the weapon into one of his own pockets he retreated a few yards.  Suddenly Gato sprang, the knife uplifted.  Tom Reade leaped in the same fraction of a second.  Tom's shoulder landed under Gato's right shoulder, and the knife did not descend.  Like a flash Tom bent as he wheeled.  Gripping the mine manager by the captured arm, Tom threw him forcefully over his own shoulder.  Pedro Gato landed, half-dazed, on the ground.  Tom, snatching the knife, hurled it as far as he could throw it.  Snarling, the big fellow started to rise.  As he did so Tom Reade's fist landed, sending the Greaser bully to earth.  The big fellow made several efforts to rise, but each time Tom's fist sent him flat again, until a final heavy blow silenced him.  \"Don Luis,\" explained Tom, quietly, turning and bowing, \"I can't begin to tell you how much I regret this unavoidable scene.  When I encountered this big bully I was at once tempted to resign my position here with you, for I realize, of course, that I cannot hope to go on with any such man in a position where I would have to depend so much upon his cheerful and friendly service.  I would have resigned, but I realize, Don Luis, how much expense you have gone to in the matter of getting us here, and I know, also, that there might be a good deal of delay in getting some one else to take our places.\"  \"Gato will not trouble you again,\" promised Don Luis, bowing charmingly.  \"Of course not, sir,\" Tom rejoined.  \"I couldn't work here and let him go on annoying me all the time.  Don Luis, I shall have to crave your indulgence to the extent of discharging this fellow and securing another manager who is less of a wild beast and more of a man.\"  \"Oh, but I cannot let Pedro Gato go,\" protested Don Luis, quickly. \"He is too old an employ, too valuable a man.  No other could manage my _peons_ as he does.\"  \"Let me go!\" begged Gato, harshly.  \"Let me go, that I may have all my time to myself that I may find the best way to avenge myself on this miserable Gringo.  Don Luis, do not think of attempting to keep me penned in _El Sombrero_.  I must be idle that I may have the more time to think.\"  Tom remained silent.  He had stated his case, and the decision must be found by Don Luis.  \"For many reasons,\" whispered Dr. Tisco, \"let Gato go.  For either good or bad reasons it will be best to let him go.\"  \"You are right, Carlos,\" nodded the mine owner quickly.  Then, raising his voice:  \"My good Gato, you shall have your wish,\" he went on, in his purring tone.  \"Yet do not think there is anger behind my words.  I let you go because it is your wish.  I do not so decide that I may humiliate you, but because you have served me well.  When you need a friend, Gatito, you will know to whom to send word.  Go your way in friendship.\"  Even Tom Reade, with his somewhat scant knowledge of Spanish, was quick to note, mentally, the meaning of that term, \"Gatito,\" which meant \"little Gato,\" and was used as a term of affection. It was a form of telegraphy that was not wasted on the departing mine manager, either, for it told him that Don Luis had some excellent reason for thus quickly falling in with the wishes of the new American chief engineer.  With a grateful smile at Don Luis, then with a scowl of unutterable hatred flung in Tom Reade's direction, Pedro Gato next turned on his heel and strode up the path.  From his pocket Harry Hazelton drew forth the silver-mounted revolver and approached the owner of the mine.  \"Allow me to return this to you, Don Luis,\" urged Hazelton.  \"I must also apologize for having snatched it from you so rudely. I did not know what else to do, for I feared that you intended to interfere in the quarrel.\"  \"And what if I had so intended?\" asked the Mexican mine owner, with one of his puzzling smiles.  \"Just this,\" Harry answered, candidly.  \"Mr. Reade never gets into a fight if he can help it.  When he does find himself in one I have learned, from long experience, not to interfere unless he calls for help.  So I did not want any one to interfere between him and Gato.\"  \"It was a most unfortunate affair,"]]]
