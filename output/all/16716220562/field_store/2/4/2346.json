DAOUD  From that quarter, great master, O Lord of the Pass.  JOHN  Daoud, I have cast men into prison for saying less than this. Men have been flogged on the feet for less than this.  DAOUD  Slay me, master, but hear my words.  JOHN  I will not slay you. You are mistaken, Daoud. You have made a great mistake. The thing is absurd. Why, the gracious lady has scarcely seen Hafiz. She knows nothing of the talk of the market. Who could tell her? No one comes here. It is absurd. Only the other day she said to me... But it is absurd, it is absurd, Daoud. Besides, the people would never rebel against me. Do I not govern them well?  DAOUD  Even so, master.  JOHN  Why should they rebel, then?  DAOUD  They think of the old times, master.  JOHN  The old times? Why, their lives weren't safe. The robbers came down from the mountains and robbed the market whenever they had a mind.  DAOUD  Master, men were content in the old times.  JOHN  But were the merchants content?  DAOUD  Those that loved merchandise were content, master. Those that loved it not went into the mountains.  JOHN  But were they content when they were robbed?  DAOUD  They soon recovered their losses, master. Their prices were unjust and they loved usury.  JOHN  And were the people content with unjust prices?  DAOUD  Some were, master, as men have to be in all countries. The others went into the mountains and robbed the merchants.  JOHN  I see.  DAOUD  But now, master, a man robs a merchant and he is cast into prison. Now a man is slain in the market and his son, his own son, master, may not follow after the aggressor and slay him and burn his house. They are ill-content, master. No man robs the merchants, no man slays them, and the merchants' hearts are hardened and they oppress all men.  JOHN  I see. They don't like good government?  DAOUD  They sigh for the old times, master.  JOHN  I see; I see. In spite of all I have done for them, they want their old bad government back again.  DAOUD  It is the old way, master.  JOHN  Yes, yes. And so they would rebel. Well, we must watch. You have warned me once again, Daoud, and I am grateful. But you are wrong, Daoud, about the gracious lady. You are mistaken. It is impossible. You are mistaken, Daoud. I know it could not be.  DAOUD  I am mistaken, master. Indeed, I am mistaken. Yet, watch. Watch, master.  JOHN  Well, I will watch.  DAOUD  And, master, if ever I come to you bearing oars, then watch no longer, master, but follow me through the banquet chamber and through the room beyond it. Move as the wild deer move when there is danger, without pausing, without wondering, without turning round; for in that hour, master, in that hour....  JOHN  Through the room beyond the banquet chamber, Daoud?  DAOUD  Aye, master, following me.  JOHN  But there is no door beyond, Daoud.  DAOUD  Master, I have prepared a door.  JOHN  A door, Daoud?  DAOUD  A door none wots of, master.  JOHN  Whither does it lead?  DAOUD  To a room that you know not of, a little room; you must stoop, master.  JOHN  O, and then?  DAOUD  To the river, master.  JOHN  The river! But there's no boat there.  DAOUD  Under the golden willow, master.  JOHN  A boat?  DAOUD  Even so, under the branches.  JOHN  Is it come to that?... No, Daoud, all this is unnecessary. It can't come to that.  DAOUD  If ever I come before you bearing two oars, in that hour, master, it is necessary.  JOHN  But you will not come. It will never come to that.  DAOUD  No, master.  JOHN  A wise man can stop things before they get as far as that.  DAOUD  They that were kings in Babylon were wise men, master.  JOHN  Babylon! But that was thousands of years ago.  DAOUD  Man changes not, master.  JOHN  Well, Daoud, I will trust you, and if it ever comes to that...  [Enter MIRALDA.]  MIRALDA  I thought Daoud was gone.  DAOUD  Even now I go, gracious lady.  [Exit DAOUD. Rather strained silence with JOHN and MIRALDA till he goes. She goes and retakes herself comfortable on the cushions. He is not entirely at ease.]  MIRALDA  You had a long talk with Daoud.  JOHN  Yes, he came and talked a good deal.  MIRALDA  What about?  JOHN  O, just talk; you know these Eastern people.  MIRALDA  I thought it was something you were discussing with him.  JOHN  O, no.  MIRALDA  Some important secret.  JOHN  No, not at all.  MIRALDA  You often talk with Daoud.  JOHN  Yes, he is useful to me. When he talks sense I listen, but to-day...  MIRALDA  What did he come for to-day?  JOHN  O, nothing.  MIRALDA  You have a secret with Daoud that you will not share with me.  JOHN  No, I have not.  MIRALDA  What was it he said?  JOHN  He said there was a king in Babylon who...  [DAOUD slips into the room.]  MIRALDA  In Babylon? What has that to do with us?  JOHN  Nothing. I told you he was not talking sense.  MIRALDA  Well, what did he say?  JOHN  He said that in Babylon...  DAOUD  Hist!  JOHN  O, well...  [MIRALDA glares, but calms herself and says nothing.  Exit DAOUD.]  MIRALDA  What did Daoud say of Babylon?  JOHN  O, well, as you say, it had nothing to do with us.  MIRALDA  But I wish to hear it.  JOHN  I forget.  [For a moment there is silence.]  MIRALDA  John, John. Will you do a little thing for me?  JOHN  What is it?  MIRALDA  Say you will do it, John. I should love to have one of my little wishes granted.  JOHN  What is it?  MIRALDA  Kill Daoud, John. I want you to kill Daoud.  JOHN  I will not.  [He walks up and down in front of the two Nubians in silence. She plucks petulantly at a pillow. She suddenly calms herself. A light comes into her eyes. The Nubians go on fanning. JOHN goes on pacing.]   MIRALDA  John, John, I have forgotten my foolish fancies.  JOHN  I am glad of it.  MIRALDA  I do not really wish you to kill Daoud.  JOHN [same voice]  I'm glad you don't.  MIRALDA  I have only one fancy now, John.  JOHN  Well, what is it?  MIRALDA  Give a banquet, John. I want you to give a banquet.  JOHN  A banquet? Why?  MIRALDA  Is there any harm in my fancy?  JOHN  No.  MIRALDA  Then if I may not be a queen, and if you will not kill Daoud for me, give a banquet, John. There is no harm in a banquet.  JOHN  Very well. When do you want it?  MIRALDA  To-morrow, John. Bid all the great ones to it, all the illustrious ones in Al Shaldomir.  JOHN  Very well.  MIRALDA  And bid Daoud come.  JOHN  Daoud? You asked me to kill him.  MIRALDA  I do not wish that any longer, John.  JOHN  You have queer moods, Miralda.  MIRALDA  May I not change my moods, John?  JOHN  I don't know. I don't understand them.  MIRALDA  And ask Hafiz el Alcolahn, John.  JOHN  Hafiz? Why?  MIRALDA  I don't know, John. It was just my fancy.  JOHN  Your fancy, eh?  MIRALDA  That was all.  JOHN  Then I will ask him. Have you any other fancy?  MIRALDA  Not now, John.  JOHN  Then go, Miralda.  MIRALDA  Go?  JOHN  Yes.  MIRALDA  Why?  JOHN  Because I command it.  MIRALDA  Because you command it?  JOHN  Yes, I, the Shereef Al Shaldomir.  MIRALDA  Very well.  [Exit L.  He walks to the door to see that she is really gone. He comes back to centre and stands with back to audience, pulling a cord quietly from his pocket and arranging it.  He moves half left and comes up behind BAZZALOL. Suddenly he slips the cord over BAZZALOL's head, and tightens it round his neck.]  [BAZZALOL flops on his knees.  THOOTHOOBABA goes on fanning.]  JOHN  Speak!  [BAZZALOL is silent.  JOHN tightens it more. THOOTHOOBABA goes on quietly fanning.]  BAZZALOL  I cannot.  JOHN  If you would speak, raise your left hand. If you raise your left hand and do not speak you shall die.  [BAZZALOL is silent. JOHN tightens more. BAZZALOL raises his great flabby left hand high. JOHN releases the cord. BAZZALOL blinks and moves his mouth.]  BAZZALOL  Gracious Shereef, one visited the great lady and gave us gold, saying, \"Speak not.\"  JOHN  When?  BAZZALOL  Great master, one hour since.  JOHN [a little viciously]  Who?  BAZZALOL  O heaven-sent, he was Hafiz el Alcolahn.  JOHN  Give me the gold.  [BAZZALOL gives it.]  [To THOOTHOOBABA.] Give me the gold.  THOOTHOOBABA  Master, none gave me gold.  [John touches his dagger, and looks like using it.  THOOTHOOBABA gives it.]  JOHN  Take back your gold. Be silent about this. You too.  [He throws gold to BAZZALOL.]  Gold does not make you silent, but there is a thing that does. What is that thing? Speak. What thing makes you silent?  BAZZALOL  O, great master, it is death.  JOHN  Death, eh? And how will you die if you speak? You know how you will die?  BAZZALOL  Yes, heaven-sent.  JOHN  Tell your comrade, then.  BAZZALOL  We shall be eaten, great master.  JOHN  You know by what?  BAZZALOL  Small things, great master, small things. Oh-h-h-h. Oh-h-h.  [THOOTHOOBABA's knees scarcely hold him.]  JOHN  It is well.   Curtain  SCENE 2  A small street.

Where I have been obliged to use technical anatomical and physiological terms I have either explained their meaning in the text, aided by diagrams and figures, or I have given in brackets the English equivalents of the terms used.  I trust my attempt to give a sketch of the mechanism of the human voice, and how it is produced in speech and song, may prove of interest to the general public, and I even hope that teachers of voice production may find some of the pages dealing with the brain mechanism not unworthy of their attention.

Before, however, passing to consider in detail the instrument, I will briefly direct your attention to some facts and theories regarding the origin of speech.     THEORIES ON THE ORIGIN OF SPEECH   The evolutionary theory is thus propounded by Romanes in his \"Mental Evolution in Man,\" pp. 377-399: \"Starting from the highly intelligent and social species of anthropoid ape as pictured by Darwin, we can imagine that this animal was accustomed to use its voice freely for the expression of the emotions, uttering danger signals, and singing. Possibly it may also have been sufficiently intelligent to use a few imitative sounds; and certainly sooner or later the receptual life of this social animal must have advanced far enough to have become comparable with that of an infant of about two years of age. That is to say, this animal, although not yet having begun to use articulate signs, must have advanced far enough in the conventional use of natural signs (a sign with a natural origin in tone and gesture, whether spontaneously or intentionally imitative) to have admitted of a totally free exchange of receptual ideas, such as would be concerned in animal wants and even, perhaps, in the simplest forms of co-operative action. Next I think it probable that the advance of receptual intelligence which would have been occasioned by this advance in sign-making would in turn have led to a development of the latter--the two thus acting and reacting on each other until the language of tone and gesture became gradually raised to the level of imperfect pantomime, as in children before they begin to use words. At this stage, however, or even before it, I think very probably vowel sounds must have been employed in tone language, if not also a few consonants. Eventually the action and reaction of receptual intelligence and conventional sign-making must have ended in so far developing the former as to have admitted of the breaking up (or articulation) of vocal sounds, as the only direction in which any improvement in vocal sign-making was possible.\" Romanes continues his sketch by referring to the probability that this important stage in the development of speech was greatly assisted by the already existing habit of articulating musical notes, supposing our progenitors to have resembled the gibbons or the chimpanzees in this respect. Darwin in his great work on the \"Expression of the Emotions\" points to the fact that the gibbon, the most erect and active of the anthropoid apes, is able to sing an octave in half-tones, and it is interesting to note that Dubois considers his Pithecanthropus Erectus is on the same stem as the gibbon. But it has lately been shown that some animals much lower in the scale than monkeys, namely, rodents, are able to produce correct musical tones. Therefore the argument loses force that the progenitors of man probably uttered musical sounds before they had acquired the power of articulate speech, and that consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion, it tends to assume through the principle of association a musical character. The work of anthropologists and linguists, especially the former, supports the progressive-evolution theory, which, briefly stated, is--that articulate language is the result of an elaboration in the long procession of ages in which there occurred three stages--the cry, vocalisation, and articulation. The cry is the primordial, pure animal language; it is a simple vocal aspiration without articulation; it is either a reflex expressing needs and emotions, or at a higher stage intentional (to call, warn, menace, etc.). Vocalisation (emission of vowels) is a natural production of the vocal instrument, and does not in itself contain the essential elements of speech. Many animals are capable of vocalisation, and in the child the utterance of vowel sounds is the next stage after the cry.  The conditions necessary to the existence of speech arose with articulation, and it is intelligence that has converted the vocal instrument into the speaking instrument. For whereas correct intonation depends upon the innate musical ear, which is able to control and regulate the tensions of the minute muscles acting upon the vocal cords, it is intelligence which alters and changes the form of the resonator by means of movement of the lips, tongue, and jaw in the production of articulate speech. The simple musical instrument in the production of phonation is bilaterally represented in the brain, but as a speaking instrument it is unilaterally represented in right-handed individuals in the left hemisphere and in left-handed individuals in the right hemisphere. The reason for this we shall consider later; but the fact supports Darwin's hypothesis.  Another hypothesis which was brought forward by Grieger and supported by some authors is summarised by Ribot as follows: \"Words are an imitation of the movements of the mouth. The predominant sense in man is that of sight; man is pre-eminently visual. Prior to the acquisition of speech he communicated with his fellows by the aid of gestures and movement of the mouth and face; he appealed to their eyes. Their facial 'grimaces,' fulfilled and elucidated by gesture, became signs for others; they fixed their attention upon them. When articulate sounds came into being, these lent themselves to a more or less conventional language by reason of their acquired importance.\" For support of this hypothesis the case of non-educated deaf-mutes is cited. They invent articulate sounds which they cannot hear and use them to designate certain things. Moreover, they employ gesture language--a language which is universally understood.  Another theory of the origin of the speaking voice is that speech is an instinct not evolved, but breaking forth spontaneously in man; but even if this be so, it was originally so inadequate and weak that it required support from the gesture language to become intelligible. This mixed language still survives among some of the inferior races of men. Miss Kingsley and Tylor have pointed out that tribes in Africa have to gather round the camp fires at night in order to converse, because their vocabulary is so incomplete that without being reinforced by gesture and pantomime they would be unable to communicate with one another. Gesture is indispensable for giving precision to vocal sounds in many languages, e.g. those of the Tasmanians, Greenlanders, savage tribes of Brazil, and Grebos of Western Africa. In other cases speech is associated with inarticulate sounds. These sounds have been compared to clicking and clapping, and according to Sayce, these clickings and clappings survive as though to show us how man when deprived of speech"]]]
