The American Secretary of Embassy and the Peruvian attaché, considering their continued presence unnecessary, went away, after warmly complimenting Don Luis Perenna on his powers of penetration.  Next came the turn of Major d'Astrignac, who shook his former subordinate by the hand with obvious affection. And Maître Lepertais and Perenna, having fixed an appointment for the payment of the legacy, were themselves on the point of leaving, when M. Desmalions entered briskly.  \"Ah, so you're still here, Don Luis Perenna! I'm glad of that. I have an idea: those three letters which you say you made out on the writing-table, are you sure they form the syllable Fau?\"  \"I think so, Monsieur le Préfet. See for yourself: are not these an 'F,' an 'A' and a 'U?' And observe that the 'F' is a capital, which made me suspect that the letters are the first syllable of a proper name.\"  \"Just so, just so,\" said M. Desmalions. \"Well, curiously enough, that syllable happens to be--But wait, we'll verify our facts--\"  M. Desmalions searched hurriedly among the letters which his secretary had handed him on his arrival and which lay on a corner of the table.  \"Ah, here we are!\" he exclaimed, glancing at the signature of one of the letters. \"Here we are! It's as I thought: 'Fauville.' ... The first syllable is the same.... Look, 'Fauville,' just like that, without Christian name or initials. The letter must have been written in a feverish moment: there is no date nor address.... The writing is shaky--\"  And M. Desmalions read out:  \"MONSIEUR LE PRÉFET:  \"A great danger is hanging over my head and over the head of my son. Death is approaching apace. I shall have to-night, or to-morrow morning at the latest, the proofs of the abominable plot that threatens us. I ask leave to bring them to you in the course of the morning. I am in need of protection and I call for your assistance.  \"Permit me to be, etc. FAUVILLE.\"  \"No other designation?\" asked Perenna. \"No letter-heading?\"  \"None. But there is no mistake. Inspector Vérot's declarations agree too evidently with this despairing appeal. It is clearly M. Fauville and his son who are to be murdered to-night. And the terrible thing is that, as this name of Fauville is a very common one, it is impossible for our inquiries to succeed in time.\"  \"What, Monsieur le Préfet? Surely, by straining every nerve--\"  \"Certainly, we will strain every nerve; and I shall set all my men to work. But observe that we have not the slightest clue.\"  \"Oh, it would be awful!\" cried Don Luis. \"Those two creatures doomed to death; and we unable to save them! Monsieur le Préfet, I ask you to authorize me--\"  He had not finished speaking when the Prefect's private secretary entered with a visiting-card in his hand.  \"Monsieur le Préfet, this caller was so persistent.... I hesitated--\"  M. Desmalions took the card and uttered an exclamation of mingled surprise and joy.  \"Look, Monsieur,\" he said to Perenna.  And he handed him the card.   _Hippolyte Fauville,    Civil Engineer. 14 bis Boulevard Suchet._  \"Come,\" said M. Desmalions, \"chance is favouring us. If this M. Fauville is one of the Roussel heirs, our task becomes very much easier.\"  \"In any case, Monsieur le Préfet,\" the solicitor interposed, \"I must remind you that one of the clauses of the will stipulates that it shall not be read until forty-eight hours have elapsed. M. Fauville, therefore, must not be informed--\"  The door was pushed open and a man hustled the messenger aside and rushed in.  \"Inspector ... Inspector Vérot?\" he spluttered. \"He's dead, isn't he? I was told--\"  \"Yes, Monsieur, he is dead.\"  \"Too late! I'm too late!\" he stammered.  And he sank into a chair, clasping his hands and sobbing:  \"Oh, the scoundrels! the scoundrels!\"  He was a pale, hollow-cheeked, sickly looking man of about fifty. His head was bald, above a forehead lined with deep wrinkles. A nervous twitching affected his chin and the lobes of his ears. Tears stood in his eyes.  The Prefect asked:  \"Whom do you mean, Monsieur? Inspector Vérot's murderers? Are you able to name them, to assist our inquiry?\"  Hippolyte Fauville shook his head.  \"No, no, it would be useless, for the moment.... My proofs would not be sufficient.... No, really not.\"  He had already risen from his chair and stood apologizing:  \"Monsieur le Préfet, I have disturbed you unnecessarily, but I wanted to know.... I was hoping that Inspector Vérot might have escaped.... His evidence, joined to mine, would have been invaluable. But perhaps he was able to tell you?\"  \"No, he spoke of this evening--of to-night--\"  Hippolyte Fauville started.  \"This evening! Then the time has come!... But no, it's impossible, they can't do anything to me yet.... They are not ready--\"  \"Inspector Vérot declared, however, that the double murder would be committed to-night.\"  \"No, Monsieur le Préfet, he was wrong there.... I know all about it.... To-morrow evening at the earliest ... and we will catch them in a trap.... Oh, the scoundrels!\"  Don Luis went up to him and asked:  \"Your mother's name was Ermeline Roussel, was it not?\"  \"Yes, Ermeline Roussel. She is dead now.\"  \"And she was from Saint-Etienne?\"  \"Yes. But why these questions?\"  \"Monsieur le Préfet will tell you to-morrow. One word more.\" He opened the cardboard box left by Inspector Vérot. \"Does this cake of chocolate mean anything to you? These marks?\"  \"Oh, how awful!\" said the civil engineer, in a hoarse tone. \"Where did the inspector find it?\"  He dropped into his chair again, but only for a moment; then, drawing himself up, he hurried toward the door with a jerky step.  \"I'm going, Monsieur le Préfet, I'm going. To-morrow morning I'll show you.... I shall have all the proofs.... And the police will protect me.... I am ill, I know, but I want to live! I have the right to live ... and my son, too.... And we will live.... Oh, the scoundrels!--\"  And he ran, stumbling out, like a drunken man.  M. Desmalions rose hastily.  \"I shall have inquiries made about that man's circumstances.... I shall have his house watched. I've telephoned to the detective office already. I'm expecting some one in whom I have every confidence.\"  Don Luis said:  \"Monsieur le Préfet, I beg you, with an earnestness which you will understand, to authorize me to pursue the investigation. Cosmo Mornington's will makes it my duty and, allow me to say, gives me the right to do so. M. Fauville's enemies have given proofs of extraordinary cleverness and daring. I want to have the honour of being at the post of danger to-night, at M. Fauville's house, near his person.\"  The Prefect hesitated. He was bound to reflect how greatly to Don Luis Perenna's interest it was that none of the Mornington heirs should be discovered, or at least be able to come between him and the millions of the inheritance. Was it safe to attribute to a noble sentiment of gratitude, to a lofty conception of friendship and duty, that strange longing to protect Hippolyte Fauville against the death that threatened him?  For some seconds M. Desmalions watched that resolute face, those intelligent eyes, at once innocent and satirical, grave and smiling, eyes through which you could certainly not penetrate their owner's baffling individuality, but which nevertheless looked at you with an expression of absolute frankness and sincerity. Then he called his secretary:  \"Has any one come from the detective office?\"  \"Yes, Monsieur le Préfet; Sergeant Mazeroux is here.\"  \"Please have him shown in.\"  And, turning to Perenna:  \"Sergeant Mazeroux is one of our smartest detectives. I used to employ him together with that poor Vérot when I wanted any one more than ordinarily active and sharp. He will be of great use to you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Mazeroux entered. He was a short, lean, wiry man, whose drooping moustache, heavy eyelids, watery eyes and long, lank hair gave him a most doleful appearance.  \"Mazeroux,\" said the Prefect, \"you will have heard, by this time, of your comrade Vérot's death and of the horrible circumstances attending it. We must now avenge him and prevent further crimes. This gentleman, who knows the case from end to end, will explain all that is necessary. You will work with him and report to me to-morrow morning.\"  This meant giving a free hand to Don Luis Perenna and relying on his power of initiative and his perspicacity. Don Luis bowed:  \"I thank you, Monsieur le Préfet. I hope that you will have no reason to regret the trust which you are good enough to place in me.\"  And, taking leave of M. Desmalions and Maître Lepertuis, he went out with Sergeant Mazeroux.  As soon as they were outside, he told Mazeroux what he knew. The detective seemed much impressed by his companion's professional gifts and quite ready to be guided by his views.  They decided first to go to the Café du Pont-Neuf. Here they learned that Inspector Vérot, who was a regular customer of the place, had written a long letter there that morning. And the waiter remembered that a man at the next table, who had entered the café at almost the same time as the inspector, had also asked for writing-paper and called twice for yellow envelopes.  \"That's it,\" said Mazeroux to Don Luis. \"As you suspected, one letter has been substituted for the other.\"  The description given by the waiter was pretty explicit: a tall man, with a slight stoop, wearing a reddish-brown beard cut into a point, a tortoise-shell eyeglass with a black silk ribbon, and an ebony walking-stick with a handle shaped like a swan's head.  \"That's something for the police to go upon,\" said Mazeroux.  They were leaving the café when Don Luis stopped his companion.  \"One moment.\"  \"What's the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],["title","The Teeth of the Tiger (#6)"],["body","atter?\"  \"We've been followed.\"  \"Followed? What next? And by whom, pray?\"  \"No one that matters. I know who it is and I may as well settle his business and have done with it. Wait for me. I shall be back; and I'll show you some fun. You shall see one of the 'nuts,' I promise you.\"  He returned in a minute with a tall, thin man with his face set in whiskers. He introduced him:  \"M. Mazeroux, a friend of mine, Señor Caceres, an attaché at the Peruvian Legation. Señor Caceres took part in the interview at the Prefect's just now. It was he who, on the Peruvian Minister's instructions, collected the documents bearing upon my identity.\" And he added gayly: \"So you were looking for me, dear Señor Caceres. Indeed, I expected, when we left the police office--\"  The Peruvian attaché made a sign and pointed to Sergeant Mazeroux. Perenna replied:  \"Oh, pray don't mind M. Mazeroux! You can speak before him; he is the soul of discretion. Besides, he knows all about the business.\"  The attaché was silent. Perenna made him sit down in front of him.  \"Speak without beating about the bush, dear Señor Caceres. It's a subject that calls for plain dealing; and I don't mind a blunt word or two. It saves such a lot of time! Come on. You want money, I suppose? Or, rather, more money. How much?\"  The Peruvian had a final hesitation, gave a glance at Don Luis's companion, and then, suddenly making up his mind, said in a dull voice:  \"Fifty thousand francs!\"  \"Oh, by Jove, by Jove!\" cried Don Luis. \"You're greedy, you know! What do you say, M. Mazeroux? Fifty thousand francs is a lot of money. Especially as--Look here, my dear Caceres, let's go over the ground again.  \"Three years ago I had the honour of making your acquaintance in Algeria, when you were touring the country. At the same time, I understood the sort of man you were; and I asked you if you could manage, in three years, with my name of Perenna, to fix me up a Spanish-Peruvian identity, furnished with unquestionable papers and respectable ancestors. You said, 'Yes,' We settled the price: twenty thousand francs. Last week, when the Prefect of Police asked me for my papers, I came to see you and learned that you had just been instructed to make inquiries into my antecedents.  \"Everything was ready, as it happened. With the papers of a deceased Peruvian nobleman, of the name of Pereira, properly revised, you had faked me up a first-rate civic status. We arranged what you were to say before the Prefect of Police; and I paid up the twenty thousand. We were quits. What more do you want?\"  The Pervian attaché did not betray the least embarrassment. He put his two elbows on the table and said, very calmly:  \"Monsieur, when treating with you, three years ago, I thought I was dealing with a gentleman who, hiding himself under the uniform of the Foreign Legion, wished to recover the means to live respectably afterward. To-day, I have to do with the universal legatee of Cosmo Mornington, with a man who, to-morrow, under a false name, will receive the sum of one million francs and, in a few months, perhaps, the sum of a hundred millions. That's quite a different thing.\"  The argument seemed to strike Don Luis. Nevertheless, he objected:  \"And, if I refuse--?\"  \"If you refuse, I shall inform the solicitor and the Prefect of Police that I made an error in my inquiry and that there is some mistake about Don Luis Perenna. In consequence of which you will receive nothing at all and very likely find yourself in jail.\"  \"With you, my worthy sir.\"  \"Me?\"  \"Of course: on a charge of forgery and tampering with registers. For you don't imagine that I should take it lying down.\"  The attaché did not reply. His nose, which was a very big one, seemed to lengthen out still farther between his two long whiskers.  Don Luis began to laugh.  \"Come, Señor Caceres, don't pull such a face! No one's going to hurt you. Only don't think that you can corner me. Better men than you have tried and have broken their backs in the process. And, upon my word, you don't cut much of a figure when you're doing your best to diddle your fellowmen.  \"You look a bit of a mug, in fact, Caceres: a bit of a mug is what you look. So it's understood, what? We lay down our arms. No more base designs against our excellent friend Perenna. Capital, Señor Caceres, capital. And now I'll be magnanimous and prove to you that the decent man of us two is--the one whom any one would have thought!\"  He produced a check-book on the Crédit Lyonnais.  \"Here, my dear chap. Here's twenty thousand francs as a present from Cosmo Mornington's legatee. Put it in your pocket and look pleasant. Say thank you to the kind gentleman, and make yourself scarce without turning your head any more than if you were one of old man Lot's daughters. Off you go: hoosh!\"  This was said in such a manner that the attaché obeyed Don Luis Perenna's injunctions to the letter. He smiled as he pocketed the check, said thank you twice over, and made off without turning his head.  \"The low hound!\" muttered Don Luis. \"What do you say to that, Sergeant?\"  Sergeant Mazeroux was looking at him in stupefaction, with his eyes starting from his head.  \"Well, but, Monsieur--\"  \"What, Sergeant?\"  \"Well, but, Monsieur, who are you?\"  \"Who am I?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Didn't they tell you? A Peruvian nobleman, or a Spanish nobleman, I don't know which. In short, Don Luis Perenna.\"  \"Bunkum! I've just heard--\"  \"Don Luis Perenna, late of the Foreign Legion.\"  \"Enough of that, Monsieur--\"  \"Medaled and decorated with a stripe on every seam.\"  \"Once more, Monsieur, enough of that; and come along with me to the Prefect.\"  \"But, let me finish, hang it! I was saying, late private in the Foreign Legion.... Late hero.... Late prisoner of the Sureté.... Late Russian prince.... Late chief of the detective service.... Late--\"  \"But you're mad!\" snarled the sergeant. \"What's all this story?\"  \"It's a true story, Sergeant, and quite genuine. You ask me who I am; and I'm telling you categorically. Must I go farther back? I have still more titles to offer you: marquis, baron, duke, archduke, grand-duke, petty-duke, superduke--the whole 'Almanach de Gotha,' by Jingo! If any one told me that I had been a king, by all that's holy, I shouldn't dare swear to the contrary!\"  Sergeant Mazeroux put out his own hands, accustomed to rough work, seized the seemingly frail wrists of the man addressing him and said:  \"No nonsense, now. I don't know whom I've got hold of, but I shan't let you go. You can say what you have to say at the Prefect's.\"  \"Don't speak so loud, Alexandre.\"  The two frail wrists were released with unparalleled ease; the sergeant's powerful hands were caught and rendered useless; and Don Luis grinned:  \"Don't you know me, you idiot?\"  Sergeant Mazeroux did not utter a word. His eyes started still farther from his head. He tried to understand and remained absolutely dumfounded.  The sound of that voice, that way of jesting, that schoolboy playfulness allied with that audacity, the quizzing expression of those eyes, and lastly that Christian name of Alexandre, which was not his name at all and which only one person used to give him, years ago. Was it possible?  \"The chief!\" he stammered. \"The chief!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"No, no, because--\"  \"Because what?\"  \"Because you're dead.\"  \"Well, what about it? D'you think it interferes with my living, being dead?\"  And, as the other seemed more and more perplexed, he laid his hand on his shoulder and said:  \"Who put you into the police office?\"  \"The Chief Detective, M. Lenormand.\"  \"And who was M. Lenormand?\"  \"The chief.\"  \"You mean Arsène Lupin, don't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, Alexandre, don't you know that it was much more difficult for Arsène Lupin to be Chief Detective--and a masterly Chief Detective he was--than to be Don Luis Perenna, to be decorated in the Foreign Legion, to be a hero, and even to be alive after he was dead?\"  Sergeant Mazeroux examined his companion in silence. Then his lacklustre eyes brightened, his drab features turned scarlet and, suddenly striking the table with his fist, he growled, in an angry voice:  \"All right, very well! But I warn you that you mustn't reckon on me. No, not that! I'm in the detective service; and in the detective service I remain. Nothing doing. I've tasted honesty and I mean to eat no other bread. No, no, no, no! No more humbug!\"  Perenna shrugged his shoulders:  \"Alexandre, you're an ass. Upon my word, the bread of honesty hasn't enlarged your intelligence. Who talked of starting again?\"  \"But--\"  \"But what?\"  \"All your maneuvers, Chief.\"  \"My maneuvers! Do you think I have anything to say to this business?\"  \"Look here, Chief--\"  \"Why, I'm out of it altogether, my lad! Two hours ago I knew no more about it than you do. It's Providence that chucked this legacy at me, without so much as shouting, 'Heads!' And it's in obedience to the decrees of--\"  \"Then--?\"  \"It's my mission in life to avenge Cosmo Mornington, to find his natural heirs, to protect them and to divide among them the hundred millions that belong to them. That's all. Don't you call that the mission of an honest man?\"  \"Yes, but--\"  \"Yes, but, if I don't fulfil it as an honest man: is that what you mean?\"  \"Chief--\"  \"Well, my lad, if you notice the least thing in my conduct that dissatisfies you, if you discover a speck of black on Don Luis Perenna's conscience, examined under the magnifying glass, don't hesitate: collar me with both hands. I authorize you to do it. I order you to do it. Is that enough for you?\"  \"It's not enough for it to be enough for me, Chief.\"  \"What are you talking about?\"  \"There are the others.\"  \"Explain yourself.\"  \"Suppose you're nabbed?\"  \"How?\"  \"You can be betrayed.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"Your old mates.\"  \"Gone away. I've sent them out of France.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"That's my secret. I left you at the police office, in case I should require your services; and you see that I was right.\"  \"But suppose the police discover your real"]]]
