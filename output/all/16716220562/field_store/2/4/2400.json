Make every path of duty straight And plain before my face.  PAUSE.  6 My watchful enemies combine To tempt my feet astray; They flatter with a base design To make my soul their prey.  7 Lord, crush the serpent in the dust, And all his plots destroy; While those that in thy mercy trust For ever shout for joy.  8 The men that love and fear thy name Shall see their hopes fulfill'd; The mighty God will compass them With favour as a shield.   Psalm 6:1. C. M. Complaint in sickness; or, diseases healed.  1 In anger, Lord, rebuke me not, Withdraw the dreadful storm; Nor let thy fury grow so hot Against a feeble worm.  2 My soul's bow'd down with heavy cares, My flesh with pain oppress'd; My couch is witness to my tears, My tears forbid my rest.  3 Sorrow and pain wear out my days; I waste the night with cries, Counting the minutes as they pass, Till the slow morning rise.  4 Shall I be still tormented more? Mine eye consum'd with grief? How long, my God, how long before Thine hand afford relief?  5 He hears when dust and ashes speak, He pities all our groans, He saves us for his mercy's sake And heals our broken bones.  6 The virtue of his sovereign word Restores our fainting breath; For silent graves praise not the Lord, Nor is he known in death.   Psalm 6:2. L. M. Temptations in sickness overcome.  1 Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes, When thou with kindness dost chastise But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear, O let it not against me rise!  2 Pity my languishing estate, And ease the sorrows that I feel; The wounds thine heavy hand hath made, O let thy gentler touches heal.  3 See how I pass my weary days In sighs and groans; and when 'tis night My bed is water'd with my tears; My grief consumes and dims my sight.  4 Look how the powers of nature mourn! How long, almighty God, how long? When shall thine hour of grace return? When shall I make thy grace my song?  5 I feel my flesh so near the grave, My thoughts are tempted to despair; But graves can never praise the Lord, For all is dust and silence there.  6 Depart, ye tempters, from my soul, And all despairing thoughts depart; My God, who hears my humble moan, Will ease my flesh, and cheer my heart.   Psalm 7. God's care of his people and punishment of persecutors.  1 My trust is in my heavenly Friend, My hope in thee, my God; Rise and my helpless life defend From those that seek my blood.  2 With insolence and fury they My soul in pieces tear, As hungry lions rend the prey When no deliverer's near.  3 If I had e'er provok'd them first, Or once abus'd my foe, Then let him tread my life to dust, And lay mine honour low.  4 If there be malice found in me, I know thy piercing eyes; I should not dare appeal to thee, Nor ask my God to rise.  5 Arise, my God, lift up thy hand, Their pride and power control; Awake to judgment and command Deliverance for my soul.  PAUSE.  6 [Let sinners and their wicked rage Be humbled to the dust; Shall not the God of truth engage To vindicate the just?  7 He knows the heart, he tries the reins, He will defend th' upright: His sharpest arrows he ordains Against the sons of spite.  8 For me their malice digg'd a pit, But there themselves are cast; My God makes all their mischief light On their own heads at last.]  9 That cruel persecuting race Must feel his dreadful sword; Awake, my soul, and praise the grace And justice of the Lord.   Psalm 8:1. S. M. God's sovereignty and goodness; and man's dominion over the creatures.  1 O Lord, our heavenly King, Thy name is all divine; Thy glories round the earth are spread, And o'er the heavens they shine.  2 When to thy works on high I raise my wondering eyes, And see the moon complete in light Adorn the darksome skies:  3 When I survey the stars, And all their shining forms, Lord, what is man, that worthless thing, Akin to dust and worms?  4 Lord, what is worthless man, That thou shouldst love him so? Next to thine angels he is plac'd, And lord of all below.  5 Thine honours crown his head, While beasts like slaves obey, And birds that cut the air with wings, And fish that cleave the sea.  6 How rich thy bounties are! And wondrous are thy ways: Of dust and worms thy power can frame A monument of praise.  7 [Out of the mouths of babes And sucklings thou canst draw Surprising honours to thy name, And strike the world with awe.]  8 O Lord, our heavenly King, Thy name is all divine: Thy glories round the earth are spread, And o'er the heavens they shine.   Psalm 8:2. C. M. Christ's condescension and glorification; or, God made man.  1 O Lord, our Lord, how wondrous great Is thine exalted name! The glories of thy heavenly state Let men and babes proclaim.  2 When I behold thy works on high, The moon that rules the night, And stars that well adorn the sky, Those moving worlds of light;  3 Lord, what is man, or all his race, Who dwells so far below, That thou shouldst visit him with grace, And love his nature so?  4 That thine eternal Son should bear To take a mortal form, Made lower than his angels are, To save a dying worm!  5 [Yet while he liv'd on earth unknown, And men would not adore, Th' obedient seas and fishes own His Godhead and his power.  6 The waves lay spread beneath his feet; And fish, at his command, Bring their large shoals to Peter's net, Bring tribute to his hand.  7 These lesser glories of the Son Shone thro' the fleshly cloud; Now we behold him on his throne, And men confess him God.]  8 Let him be crown'd with majesty, Who bow'd his head to death; And be his honours sounded high, By all things that have breath.  9 Jesus, our Lord, how wondrous great Is thine exalted name! The glories of thy heavenly state Let the whole earth proclaim.   Psalm 8:3. 1 2. paraphrased. First Part. L. M. The Hosanna of the children; or, Infants praising God.  1 Almighty Ruler of the skies, Thro' the wide earth thy name is spread, And thine eternal glories rise O'er all the heavens thy hands have made.  2 To thee the voices of the young A monument of honour raise; And babes, with uninstructed tongue, Declare the wonders of thy praise.  3 Thy power assists their tender age To bring proud rebels to the ground, To still the bold blasphemer's rage, And all their policies confound.  4 Children amidst thy temple throng To see their great Redeemer's face; The Son of David is their song, And young hosannas fill the place.  3 The frowning scribes and angry priests In vain their impious cavils bring; Revenge sits silent in their breasts, While Jewish babes proclaim their king.   Psalm 8:4. 3 &c. paraphrased. Second Part. L. M. Adam and Christ, lords of the old and the new creation.  1 Lord, what was man, when made at first, Adam the offspring of the dust, That thou shouldst set him and his race But just below an angel's place?  2 That thou shouldst raise his nature so And make him lord of all below; Make every beast and bird submit, And lay the fishes at his feet?  3 But O, what brighter glories wait To crown the second Adam's state! What honours shall thy Son adorn Who condescended to be born!  4 See him below his angels made, See him in dust amongst the dead, To save a ruin'd world from sin; But he shall reign with power divine.  5 The world to come, redeem'd from all The miseries that attend the fall, New made, and glorious, shall submit At our exalted Saviour's feet.   Psalm 9:1. First Part. Wrath and mercy from the judgment-seat.  1 With my whole heart I'll raise my song, Thy wonders I'll proclaim; Thou sov'reign judge of right and wrong Wilt put my foes to shame.  2 I'll sing thy majesty and grace; My God prepares his throne To judge the world in righteousness And make his vengeance known.  3 Then shall the Lord a refuge prove For all the poor opprest, To save the people of his love, And give the weary rest.  4 The men, that know thy name will trust In thy abundant grace; For thou hast ne'er forsook the just, Who humbly seek thy face.  5 Sing praises to the righteous Lord, Who dwells on Zion's hill, Who executes his threatening word, And doth his grace fulfil.   Psalm 9:2. 10. Second Part. The wisdom and equity of providence.  1 When the great Judge, supreme and just, Shall once inquire for blood, The humble souls, that mourn in dust, Shall find a faithful God.  2 He from the dreadful gates of death Does his own children raise: In Zion's gates, with cheerful breath, They sing their Father's praise.  3 His foes shall fail with heedless feet Into the pit they made; And sinners perish in the net That their own hands had spread.  4 Thus by thy judgments, mighty God! Are thy deep counsels known; When men of mischief are destroy'd, The snare must be their own.  PAUSE.  5 The wicked shall sink down to hell; Thy wrath devour the lands That dare forget thee, or rebel Against thy known commands.  6 Tho' saints to sore distress are brought, And wait and long complain, Their cries shall not be still forgot, Nor shall their hopes be vain.  7 [Rise, great Redeemer, from thy seat, To judge and save the poor; Let nations tremble at thy feet, And man prevail no more.  8 Thy thunder shall affright the proud, And put their hearts to pain, Make them confess that thou art God, And they but feeble men.]   Psalm 10. Prayer heard, and saints saved; or, Pride, atheism, and oppression punished.  For a humiliation day.  1 Why doth the Lord stand off so far, And why conceal his face, When great calamities appear, And times of deep distress?  2 Lord, shall the wicked still deride Thy justice"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],["title","The Psalms of David (#4)"],["body","thy pow'r? Shall they advance their heads in pride, And still thy saints devour?  3 They put thy judgments from their sight, And then insult the poor; They boast in their exalted height That they shall fall no more.  4 Arise, O God, lift up thine hand, Attend our humble cry; No enemy shall dare to stand When God ascends on high.  PAUSE.  5 Why do the men of malice rage, And say with foolish pride, \"The God of heaven will ne'er engage To fight on Zion's side?\"  6 But thou for ever art our Lord; And pow'rful is thine hand, As when the heathens felt thy sword, And perish'd from thy land.  7 Thou wilt prepare our hearts to pray, And cause thine ear to hear; He hearkens what his children say, And puts the world in fear.  8 Proud tyrants shall no more oppress, No more despise the just; And mighty sinners shall confess They are but earth and dust.   Psalm 11. God loves the righteous and hates the wicked.  1 My refuge is the God of love; Why do my foes insult and cry, \"Fly like a timorous trembling dove, \"To distant woods or mountains fly\"?  2 If government be all destroy'd (That firm foundation of our peace) And violence make justice void, Where shall the righteous seek redress?  3 The Lord in heaven has fix'd his throne, His eye surveys the world below; To him all mortal things are known, His eyelids search our spirits thro'.  4 If he afflicts his saints so far To prove their love, and try their grace, What may the bold transgressors fear? His very soul abhors their ways.  5 On impious wretches he shall rain Tempests of brimstone, fire, and death, Such as he kindled on the plain Of Sodom with his angry breath.  6 The righteous Lord loves righteous souls, Whose thoughts and actions are sincere; And with a gracious eye beholds The men that his own image bear.   Psalm 12:1. L. M. The saint's safety and hope in evil times; or, Sins of the tongue complained of, viz, blasphemy, falsehood, &c.  1 Lord, if thou dost not soon appear, Virtue and truth will fly away; A faithful man, amongst us here, Will scarce be found if thou delay.  2 The whole discourse, when neighbours meet, Is fill'd with trifles loose and vain; Their lips are flattery and deceit, And their proud language is profane.  3 But lips, that with deceit abound, Shall not maintain their triumph long; The God of vengeance will confound The flattering and blaspheming tongue.  4 \"Yet shall our words be free,\" they cry, \"Our tongue shall be controll'd by none: \"Where is the Lord will ask us why? \"Or say, our lips are not our own?\"  5 The Lord who sees the poor opprest, And hears th' oppressor's haughty strain, Will rise to give his children rest, Nor shall they trust his word in vain.  6 Thy word, O Lord, tho' often try'd, Void of deceit shall still appear Not silver, seven times purify'd From dross and mixture, shines so clear.  7 Thy grace shall in the darkest hour Defend the holy soul from harm; Tho' when the vilest men have power On every side will sinners swarm.   Psalm 12:2. C. M. Complaint of a general corruption of manners; or, The promise and signs of Christ's coming to judgment.  1 Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail, Religion loses ground, The sons of violence prevail, And treacheries abound.  2 Their oaths and promises they break, Yet act the flatterer's part; With fair deceitful lips they speak, And with a double heart.  3 If we reprove some hateful lie, How is their fury stirr'd! \"Are not our lips our own\" they cry, \"And who shall be our lord?\"  4 Scoffers appear on every side, Where a vile race of men Is rais'd to seats of power and pride, And bears the sword in vain.  PAUSE.  5 Lord, when iniquities abound, And blasphemy grows bold, When faith is hardly to be found, And love is waxing cold,  6 Is not thy chariot hastening on? Hast thou not given this sign? May we not trust and live upon A promise so divine?  7 \"Yes,\" saith the Lord, \"now will I rise, \"And make oppressors flee; \"I shall appear to their surprise, \"And set my servants free.\"  8 Thy word, like silver seven times try'd, Thro' ages shall endure; The men that in thy truth confide, Shall find thy promise sure.   Psalm 13:1. L. M. Pleading with God under desertion; or, Hope, in darkness.  1 How long, 0 Lord, shall I complain Like one that seeks his God in vain? Canst thou thy face for ever hide? And I still pray and be deny'd?  2 Shall I for ever be forgot As one whom thou regardest not? Still shall my soul thine absence mourn? And still despair of thy return?  3 How long shall my poor troubled breast Be with these anxious thoughts opprest? And Satan, my malicious foe, Rejoice to see me sunk so low.  4 Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief, Before my death conclude my grief; If thou withhold thy heavenly light, I sleep in everlasting night.  5 How will the powers of darkness boast, If but one praying soul be lost! But I have trusted in thy grace, And shall again behold thy face.  6 Whate'er my fears or foes suggest, Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest; My heart shall feel thy love, and raise My cheerful voice to songs of praise.   Psalm 13:2. C. M. Complaint under temptations of the devil.  1 How long wilt thou conceal thy face? My God, how long delay? When shall I feel those heavenly rays That chase my fears away?  2 How long shall my poor labouring soul Wrestle and toil in vain? Thy word can all my foes control, And ease my raging pain.  3 See how the prince of darkness tries All his malicious arts, He spreads a mist around my eyes, And throws his fiery darts.  4 Be thou my sun and thou my shield, My soul in safety keep; Make haste before mine eyes are seal'd In death's eternal sleep.  5 How would the tempter boast aloud If I become his prey! Behold the sons of hell grow proud At thy so long delay.  6 But they shall fly at thy rebuke, And Satan hide his head; He knows the terrors of thy look And hears thy voice with dread.  7 Thou wilt display that sovereign grace, Where all my hopes have hung; I shall employ my lips in praise, And victory shall be sung.   Psalm 14:1. First Part. By nature all men are sinners.  1 Fools in their hearts believe and say, \"That all religion's vain, \"There is no God that reigns on high, \"Or minds th' affairs of men.\"  2 From thoughts so dreadful and profane Corrupt discourse proceeds; And in their impious hands are found Abominable deeds.  3 The Lord, from his celestial throne Look'd down on things below, To find the man that sought his grace, Or did his justice know.  4 By nature all are gone astray, Their practice all the same; There's none that fears his Maker's hand, There's none that loves his name.  5 Their tongues are us'd to speak deceit, Their slanders never cease; How swift to mischief are their feet, Nor knew the paths of peace.  6 Such seeds of sin (that bitter root) In every heart are found; Nor can they bear diviner fruit, Till grace refine the ground.   Psalm 14:2. Second Part. The folly of persecutors.  1 Are sinners now so senseless grown That they thy saints devour? And never worship at thy throne, Nor fear thine awful power?  2 Great God appear to their surprise, Reveal thy dreadful name; Let them no more thy wrath despise, Nor turn our hope to shame.  3 Dost thou not dwell among the just? And yet our foes deride, That we should make thy name our trust; Great God, confound their pride.  4 O that the joyful day were come To finish our distress! When God shall bring his children home, Our songs shall never cease.   Psalm 15:1. C. M. Characters of a saint; or, a citizen of Zion; or, The qualifications of a Christian.  1 Who shall inhabit in thy hill, O God of holiness? Whom will the Lord admit to dwell So near his throne of grace?  2 The man that walks in pious ways, And works with righteous hands; That trusts his Maker's promises, And follows his commands.  3 He speaks the meaning of his heart, Nor slanders with his tongue; Will scarce believe an ill report, Nor do his neighbour wrong.  4 The wealthy sinner he contemns, Loves all that fear the Lord: And tho' to his own hurt he swears, Still he performs his word.  5 His hands disdain a golden bribe, And never gripe the poor; This man shall dwell with God on earth, And find his heaven secure.   Psalm 15:2. L. M. Religion and justice, goodness and truth; or, Duties to God and man; or, The qualifications of a Christian.  1 Who shall ascend thy heavenly place, Great God, and dwell before thy face? The man that minds religion now, And humbly walks with God below:  2 Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean, Whose lips still speak the thing they mean; No slanders dwell upon his tongue; He hates to do his neighbour wrong.  3 [Scarce will he trust an ill report, Nor vents it to his neighbour's hurt: Sinners of state he can despise, But saints are honour'd in his eyes.]  4 [Firm to his word he ever stood, And always makes his promise good; Nor dares to change the thing he swears, Whatever pain or loss he bears.]  5 [He never deals in bribing gold, And mourns that justice should be sold: While others gripe and grind the poor, Sweet charity attends his door.]  6 [He loves his enemies, and prays For those that curse him to his face; And doth to all men still the same That he would hope or wish from them.]  7 Yet when his holiest works are done, His soul depends on grace alone; This is the man thy face shall see, And dwell for ever Lord, with thee.   Psalm 16:1. First Part. L. M. Confession of our poverty, and saints the best company; or, Good works profit men, not God.  1 Preserve me, Lord, in time of need For succour to thy throne I flee, But have no merits there to plead; My goodness cannot reach to thee.  2 Oft have my heart and tongue confest How empty and how poor I am; My praise can never make thee blest, Nor add new glories to thy name.  3 Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap Some profit by the good we do; These are the company I keep, These are the choicest friends I know.  4 Let others choose the sons of mirth To give a relish to their wine, I love the men of heavenly birth, Whose thoughts"]]]
