Mr. Budlong should have been a medieval general.  He pillaged that store with the thoroughness of the Crusaders looting Constantinople.  The town clock was striking midnight as the Budlongs dragged themselves home.  There was much yet to be done.  Parcels must be opened, price tags removed, gifts done up in pink tissue paper and gold twine, cards must be inscribed and inserted and the parcels rewrapped and addressed. The Strouther and Streckfuss driver had been hired at an exorbitant cost to sit up and deliver the gifts.  The horses had not been consulted.  They leaned on each other and slept, dreaming of oats.  The Budlong parlor was soon a hideous scene.  The husband would open a bundle and sing out, \"Who's this big immense pink and purple cuspidor for?\"  \"That's a jardineer,\" Mrs. Budlong would gasp.  \"It's a return for that horrible cat those hateful Disneys are going to inflict on me.  Here's the card.\"  She handed him a holly-wreathed pasteboard on which she had written, \"For Mr. and Mrs. Disney with most affectionate Yuletide greetings.\"  She indited cards as fast as she could think up phrases.  She sought for variety, but the effort was maddening.  She wrote, \"Very merry Christmas,\" \"The merriest of Xmases,\" \"A merry merry Yuletide,\" \"A Happy Christmas and a Merry New Year,\" \"Christmas Greetings,\" \"Xmas Greetings,\" \"Yuletide Greetings,\" \"Wishing you a--\" \"With loving wishes for--\" \"Affectionate,\" and so on and so on and on and on.  She scribbled and scrawled till slumber drugged her and her pen went crazy. When she fell asleep she was writing \"A Yuly Newmas and a Happy X-Year to Swally Sezey.\"  The delivery man pounded on the door and wild-eyed Budlong let him in from the night.  The man whispered that he'd have to start at once if he was to make the rounds before his horses laid down on him.  Mr. Budlong called his wife, but she did not answer.  He shook her and she threatened to roll off the chair on to a divan.  Mr. Budlong straightened her out and gazed at her in hopeless pity.  He stared at the chaos of bundles.  He seized the pack of cards from his wife's chubby fingers and ran here and there jabbing pasteboards into bundles, regardless.  That is how Myra Eppley acquired an ash tray lined with cigar bands, and why old Mr. Clute was amazed to receive a card offering him Mrs. Budlong's \"loving and affectionate greetings.\"  He was more amazed when he opened the bundle.  It had ribbons in it.  There were other amazements in town the next morning.  In fact, it was the amazingest Christmas Carthage had ever had.  As fast as Mr. Budlong stuffed cards into bundles, he loaded bundles into the driver's arms as if they were sticks of wood.  The driver stacked them up in his wagon.  He made seven trips in all and some of the cards fell out and were stuck in still wronger bundles than before. But both the driver and Mr. Budlong were too sleepy to care.  The driver finally mounted his seat and called out from the dark:  \"Say, Mr. Budlong, where do I leave these packages--on the porch, or do I ring the bell?\"  \"Chuck 'em through the windows!  The more glass you break the better I'll like it.\"  \"All right, sir.  Get ap!  Good night, sir, and wishing you a Merry Christmas!\"  \"Merry ------\" said Mr. Budlong, reaching for a rock.  But even the stones were frozen to the ground and the driver escaped.  As Mr. Budlong closed his front door, a thread of crimson spun out along the East as if somebody were going to wrap the whole world up in a red string.  He did not want it.  He yawned at it.  An hour or so later, Ulie awoke and sat up with a start.  To his intense confusion, he bumped the top of his little skull on the bottom of his little bed.  He was calling for help when he realized that he had fallen asleep in his ambush.  He peered forth to see if he had snared Santa Claus.  The figure-4 trap was erect and intact, but empty.  He crawled out and ran to the row of stockings he had hung on the mantelpiece as a decoy.  The stockings were empty.  With a shriek of disappointed rage, Ulie dashed into his parents' room to protest.  Their bed was empty.  He ran through the house, stumbled down stairs and into the back parlor.  His father was snoring on a mattress of Yuletide parcels.  His mother was curled up on a divan under the smoking piano lamp.  Her hands were clutching strands of gold cord and her hair was pillowed in pink tissue paper.  She was burbling in her sleep.  Little Ulie bent down to hear what she was saying.  He made out faintly;  \"Mishing you a Werry Muschris and a Nappy Hoosier.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12884"],["title","Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography (#0)"],["body","Editorial note: Randy Adams, the author of this book, wrote from                 first-hand experience.

IN CONCLUSION     CHAPTER I  IN RETROSPECT   I can truthfully say that my entire life has been spent with cattle. Even during my four years' service in the Confederate army, the greater portion was spent with the commissary department, in charge of its beef supplies. I was wounded early in the second year of the war and disabled as a soldier, but rather than remain at home I accepted a menial position under a quartermaster. Those were strenuous times. During Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania we followed in the wake of the army with over a thousand cattle, and after Gettysburg we led the retreat with double that number. Near the close of the war we frequently had no cattle to hold, and I became little more than a camp-follower.  I was born in the Shenandoah Valley, northern Virginia, May 3, 1840. My father was a thrifty planter and stockman, owned a few slaves, and as early as I can remember fed cattle every winter for the eastern markets. Grandfather Anthony, who died before I was born, was a Scotchman who had emigrated to the Old Dominion at an early day, and acquired several large tracts of land on an affluent of the Shenandoah. On my paternal side I never knew any of my ancestors, but have good cause to believe they were adventurers. My mother's maiden name was Reed; she was of a gentle family, who were able to trace their forbears beyond the colonial days, even to the gentry of England. Generations of good birth were reflected in my mother; and across a rough and eventful life I can distinctly remember the refinement of her manners, her courtesy to guests, her kindness to child and slave.  My boyhood days were happy ones. I attended a subscription school several miles from home, riding back and forth on a pony. The studies were elementary, and though I never distinguished myself in my classes, I was always ready to race my pony, and never refused to play truant when the swimming was good. Evidently my father never intended any of his boys for a professional career, though it was an earnest hope of my mother that all of us should receive a college education. My elder brother and I early developed business instincts, buying calves and accompanying our father on his trading expeditions. Once during a vacation, when we were about twelve and ten years old, both of us crossed the mountains with him into what is now West Virginia, where he bought about two hundred young steers and drove them back to our home in the valley. I must have been blessed with an unfailing memory; over fifty years have passed since that, my first trip from home, yet I remember it vividly--can recall conversations between my father and the sellers as they haggled over the cattle. I remember the money, gold and silver, with which to pay for the steers, was carried by my father in ordinary saddle-bags thrown across his saddle. As occasion demanded, frequently the funds were carried by a negro man of ours, and at night, when among acquaintances, the heavy saddle-bags were thrown into a corner, every one aware of their contents.  But the great event of my boyhood was a trip to Baltimore. There was no railroad at the time, and as that was our market for fat cattle, it was necessary to drive the entire way. My father had made the trip yearly since I could remember, the distance being nearly two hundred miles, and generally carrying as many as one hundred and fifty big beeves. They traveled slowly, pasturing or feeding grain on the way, in order that the cattle should arrive at the market in salable condition. One horse was allowed with the herd, and on another my father rode, far in advance, to engage pasture or feed and shelter for his men. When on the road a boy always led a gentle ox in the lead of the beeves; negro men walked on either flank, and the horseman brought up the rear. I used to envy the boy leading the ox, even though he was a darky. The negro boys on our plantation always pleaded with \"Mars\" John, my father, for the privilege; and when one of them had made the trip to Baltimore as a toll boy he easily outranked us younger whites. I must have made application for the position when I was about seven years old, for it seemed an age before my request was granted. My brother, only two years older than I, had made the trip twice, and when I was twelve the great opportunity came. My father had nearly two hundred cattle to go to market that year, and the start was made one morning early in June. I can distinctly see my mother standing on the veranda of our home as I led the herd by with a big red ox, trembling with fear that at the final moment her permission might be withdrawn and that I should have to remain behind. But she never interfered with my father, who took great pains to teach his boys everything practical in the cattle business.  It took us twenty days to reach Baltimore. We always started early in the morning, allowing the beeves to graze and rest along the road, and securing good pastures for them at night. Several times it rained, making the road soft, but I stripped off my shoes and took it barefooted through the mud. The lead ox was a fine, big fellow, each horn tipped with a brass knob, and he and I set the pace, which was scarcely that of a snail. The days were long, I grew desperately hungry between meals, and the novelty of leading that ox soon lost its romance. But I was determined not to show that I was tired or hungry, and frequently, when my father was with us and offered to take me up behind him on his horse, I spurned his offer and trudged on till the end of the day. The mere driving of the beeves would have been monotonous, but the constant change of scene kept us in good spirits, and our darkies always crooned old songs when the road passed through woodlands. After the beeves were marketed we spent a day in the city, and my father took my brother and me to the theatre. Although the world was unfolding rather rapidly for a country boy of twelve, it was with difficulty that I was made to understand that what we had witnessed on the stage was but mimicry.  The third day after reaching the city we started on our return. The proceeds from the sale of the cattle were sent home by boat. With only two horses, each of which carried double, and walking turn about, we reached home in seven days, settling all bills on the way. That year was a type of others until I was eighteen, at which age I could guess within twenty pounds of the weight of any beef on foot, and when I bought calves and yearling steers I knew just what kind of cattle they would make at maturity. In the mean time, one summer my father had gone west as far as the State of Missouri, traveling by boat to Jefferson City, and thence inland on horseback. Several of our neighbors had accompanied him, all of them buying land, my father securing four sections. I had younger brothers growing up, and the year my oldest brother attained his majority my father outfitted him with teams, wagons, and two trusty negro men, and we started for the nearest point on the Ohio River, our destination being the new lands in the West. We embarked on the first boat, drifting down the Ohio, and up the other rivers, reaching the Ultima Thule of our hopes within a month. The land was new; I liked it; we lived on venison and wild turkeys, and when once we had built a log house and opened a few fields, we were at peace with the earth.  But this happy existence was of short duration. Rumors of war reached us in our western elysium, and I turned my face homeward, as did many another son of Virginia. My brother was sensible enough to remain behind on the new farm; but with nothing to restrain me I soon found myself in St. Louis. There I met kindred spirits, eager for the coming fray, and before attaining my majority I was bearing arms and wearing the gray of the Confederacy. My regiment saw very little service during the first year of the war, as it was stationed in the western division, but early in 1862 it was engaged in numerous actions.  I shall never forget my first glimpse of the Texas cavalry. We had moved out from Corinth, under cover of darkness, to attack Grant at Pittsburg Landing. When day broke, orders were given to open out and allow the cavalry to pass ahead and reconnoitre our front. I had always felt proud of Virginian horsemanship, but those Texans were in a class by themselves. Centaur-like they sat their horses, and for our amusement, while passing at full gallop, swung from their saddles and picked up hats and handkerchiefs. There was something about the Texans that fascinated me, and that Sunday morning I resolved, if spared, to make Texas my future home. I have good cause to remember the battle of Shiloh, for during the second day I was twice wounded, yet saved from falling into the enemy's hands.  My recovery was due to youth and a splendid constitution. Within six weeks I was"]]]
