She had just come at it, or toward it; or as her husband began to say, tip against it.  Mr. Budlong was kept on such tenterhooks by lawyers and papers to sign, titles to clear, executors and executrices to consult, and waivers, deeds, indentures and things that he had no time for his regular business.  As there is housemaid's knee, and painter's colic, so there is millionaire's melancholia.  And the Budlongs were enduring the illness without entertaining the microbe.  It is almost as much trouble to inherit money nowadays as to earn it in the first place.  Mr. Budlong was confronted with such a list of post-mortem debts that must be postpaid for his deceased Aunt Ida that he almost begrudged her her bit of very real estate in Woodlawn.  And the Budlongs began to think that tombstones were in bad form if ostentatious.  Heirs have notoriously simple tastes in monuments.  They had always accounted Aunt Ida a hard-fisted miser before, but now she began to look like a slippery-palmed spendthrift.  They began almost to suspect the probity of the poor old maid.  Worse yet, they feared that a later will might turn up bequeathing all her money to some abominable charity or other.  She had been addicted to occasional subscriptions during her lifetime.  The Budlongs themselves were beginning, even at this distance from their money-to-be, to suffer its infection, its inevitable reaction on the character.  Those who live beyond their means joyously when their means are small, become small themselves, when their means get beyond living beyond.  The Budlongs began to figure percentages on sums left in the bank or put out on mortgages.  They began to think money; and money is money, large or small.  Mrs. Budlong began to feel that she had been unjust to Aunt Ida.  What she had called miserliness was really prudence and thrift and other pleasant-sounding virtues.  What she had called liberality was wanton waste.  Finally her social debts reached such a mass that she decided to give a large dinner to wipe off a great number at once.  But now when she calculated that the olives, the turkey, the Malaga grapes, the English walnuts, the salted almonds and a man from the hotel to wait on table, would total up twenty-five dollars or so, she found herself figuring how much twenty-five dollars would amount to in twenty-five years at compound interest.  She grew frantic to be quit of Carthage--to rub it off her visiting list.  Unconsciously her motto became Cato's ruthless _Carthago delenda est_.  But she could neither delete Carthage from her map, nor free her feet from its dust.  Her husband's business required him yet awhile.  Even to close it up took time.  And he would not, and could not, borrow money on Aunt Ida's estate till he was sure that it was his.  But all the while the festival reveled on.  People in Carthage to whom New York was an inaccessible Carcassone, were now planning to visit Mrs. Budlong there at the palatial home she had described.  Some of them frankly told her they were coming to see her.  Wealth took on a new discomfort.  Sally Swezey afflicted the telephone with gossip: \"As Mrs. Talbot was saying only yes'day, my dear, so many folks have threatened to visit you in your home on Fifth Avenue that you'll have to hang hammocks in your front yard.\"  And now they had spoiled even her future for her.  What pride could she take in having a gorgeous home on Fifth Avenue with all these Carthage people rocking on the front porch.  Probably some warm evening when Mrs. Hotel Vanderbilt was driving by in her new barouche, it would be just like Roscoe Detwiller to turn in at the gate, flounce down on the top step and sit there with his vest unbuttoned, and his seersucker coat under his arm, while he mopped the inside of his hat with his handkerchief.  But that was the discomfort of the morrow.  To-day had its own spawn. One morning she was called to the telephone by the merciless Sallie Swezey with a new infliction.  There was something almost ghoulish in Mrs. Swezey's cackling glee as she sang out across the wire:  \"We're all so glad, my dear, that the next meeting of the Progressive Euchre is to be at your house.\"  Mrs. Budlong's chin dropped.  She had quite forgotten this.  Sallie chortled on:  \"And say, do you know what?\"  \"What?\"  \"Everybody says you're going to give solid gold prizes and that even your booby prize will be handsomer than the first prize was at Mrs. Detwiller's.\"  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Mrs. Budlong in a tone that sounded just like the spelling.  Mrs. Budlong's wealth seemed to be accepted as a sort of municipal legacy.  All Carthage assumed to own it in community, and to enjoy it with her.  Her walls rang with the hilarity of her neighbors.  But her laughter took on more and more the sound of icicles snapping from the eaves of a shed.  She became the logical candidate for all the chief offices in clubs and societies and circles.  She suddenly found herself seven or eight presidents and at least eleven chairwomen.  The richest woman in town heretofore was Mrs. Foster Herpers, wife of the pole and shaft manufacturer.  He owned about half of the real estate in town, but his wife had to distill expenses out of him in pennies.  With a profound sigh of relief she resigned all her honors in Mrs. Budlong's favor.  Being president chiefly meant lending one's house for meetings as well as one's china and tea and sandwiches, and being five dollars ahead of anybody else in every subscription.  Mrs. Budlong was panic-stricken with her own success, for there is nothing harder to handle than a dam-break of prosperity.  Worse yet, Mr. Budlong was ceasing to be the meek thing of yore.  Every day was the first of the month with him.  It was well on in November when he flung himself into a Morris chair one evening and groaned aloud:  \"I don't believe Aunt Ida ever left any money.  If she did I don't believe we'll ever get any of it.  And if we do, I know we'll not have a sniff at it before January.  One of the lawyers has been called abroad on another case.  We've got to stay in Carthage, at least over Christmas.\"  \"Christmas!\" The word crackled and sputtered in Mrs. Budlong's brain like a fuse in the dark.  The past month had been so packed with other excitements that she had forgotten the very word.  Now it blew up and came down as if one of her own unstable Christmas trees had toppled over on her with all its ropes of tinsel, its lambent tapers, and its eggshell splendors.     V  THE BITER BIT  First, Mrs. Budlong felt amazement that she could have so ignored the very focus of her former ambition.  Then she felt shame at her unpreparedness.  She caught the evening paper out of her husband's lap to find the date.  November ninth and not a Christmas thing begun.  Yet a few days and the news-stands would have apprised her that Christmas was coming, for by the middle of November all the magazines put on their holly and their chromos of the three Magi and their Santa Clauses, as women put on summer straw hats at Easter.  Mrs. Budlong's hands sought and wrung each other as if in mutual reproach.  They had been pouring tea and passing wafers when they should have been Dorcassing at their Christmas tasks.  It had been left for her husband of all people to warn her that her own special Bacchanal was imminent.  If he had been a day later, the neighbors would have anticipated him as well as the magazines.  The Christmas idea seemed to strike the whole town at once.  Mrs. Budlong became the victim of her own classic device of pretending to let slip a secret.  The townswomen shamelessly turned her own formula against her.  Mrs. Detwiller met her at church and said:  \"Yesterday morning at eleven I had the most curious presentiment, my dear.  I remember the hour so exactly because I've been making it a rule to begin work on your Christmas present every morning at--  Oh, but I didn't inTend to let you know.  No, dearie, I won't tell you what it is.  But I can't help believing it's Just what you'll need in New York.\"  Myra Eppley, with whom Mrs. Budlong had never exchanged Christmas presents, at all, but with whom an intimacy had sprung up since Mrs. Budlong came into the reputation of her money--Myra Eppley had the effrontery to call up on the telephone and say:  \"Would you mind telling me, my dear, the shade of wall paper you're going to have in your New York parlor, because I'm making you the daintiest little--well, no matter, but will you tell me?\"  Poor Mrs. Budlong almost swooned from the telephone.  She did not know what the color of her wall paper would be in New York.  She did not know that she would ever have wall paper in New York.  She only knew that Myra Eppley, too, was calling her \"my dear.\"  Myra Eppley also was going to give her a Christmas present.  And would have to be given one.  Mrs. Budlong had received fair warning, but she felt about as grateful as a wayfarer feels to the rattlesnake that whizzes \"Make r-r-r-ready for the corrroner-r-r.\"  Next, young Mrs. Chur (Editha Cinnamon as was, for she had finally landed Mr. Chur in spite of the accident--or because of it) called up to say:  \"Oh, my dear, my husband wants to know what brand of cigars your husband smokes; and would you tell me, dearie--it's rather personal, but--what size bath-slippers you wear?\"  When Sally Swezey came to the Progressive Euchre skirmish at Mrs. Budlong's she noted with joy that her hint had borne fruit.  The prizes were indeed of solid gold.  Mr. Budlong did not learn it till the first of the following month when the bill came in from Jim Henderson's jewelry store.  As if she had not done enough in forcing solid gold prizes on Mr. Budlong, Sally had to say:  \"I'm just dying to see your back parlor, my dear, this next Christmas afternoon.  It has always been a sight for sore eyes; but this Christmas it will be a perfect wonder, for I do declare everybody in town is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12881"],["title","Mrs. Budlong's Christmas Presents (#4)"],["body","to send you something nice.\"  This conviction was already chilling Mrs. Budlong's marrow.  Of old she would have rejoiced at the golden triumph, but now she could only realize that if everybody in Carthage sent her something nice, it was because everybody in Carthage expected something nicer.  And her Christmas crops were hopelessly backward.  At a time when she should be half done, she could not even begin.  She had not tatted or smeared or hammered a thing.     VI  DESPAIR AND AN IDEA  Days and days went by in a stupor of dull hopelessness.  Thanksgiving came and the Budlong turkey might as well have been a crow.  In desperation she decided to make a tentative exploration of the shops now burgeoning with Christmas splendor; every window a spasm of gewgaws.  Since she had no time to make, she must buy.  The length of her list sent her to the cheaper counters, but she was not permitted to browse among them.  At Strouther and Streckfuss's, Mr. Strouther came up and said with reeking unctuousness:  \"Vat is Mees Bootlonk doink down here amonkst all this tresh?  Come see our importet novelties.\"  And he led her to a region where the minimum price was MBBA-BDJA, which meant that it cost 12.25 and could be safely marked down to 23.75.  She eluded him and got back to the 25-cent realm only to be apprehended by Mr. Streckfuss, who beamed:  \"Ah, nothink is here for a lady like you are.  Only fine kvality suits such a taste you got.\"  By almost superfeminine strength she evaded purchasing anything.  She went to other shops only to be haled to the expensive counters. Storekeepers simply would not discuss cheap things with the millionairess-elect.  She crept home and threw herself on her husband's mercy.  He had none and she lighted hard.  It was the first of December, and in addition to his monthly rage, Mr. Budlong was working himself up to his regular pre-Christmas frenzy, when he always felt poor and talked poorer to keep the family in check.  His face was a study when he had heard his wife's state of mind. Forthwith he delivered the annual address on Christmas folly that one hears from fathers of families all round the world at this time:  \"Christmas has quit being a sign of people's affections,\" Mr. Budlong thundered.  \"It has become a public menace.  It's worse than Wall Street.  Wall Street is supposed have started as the thermometer of the country's business and now it's gone and got so goldum big that the thermometer is makin' the weather.  When Wall Street feels muggy it's got to rain and the sun don't dare shine without takin' a peek at the thermometer first off.  \"Christmas ain't any longer an opportunity to show good will to your neighbors.  It's a time when you got to show off before your neighbors. You women make yourselves and us men sick the way you carry on all through December.  And the children!--they're worse'n the grown-ups.  \"Old-fashioned Christmas was like old-fashioned circuses--mostly meant for the young ones.  Nowadays circuses have growed so big and so improper that nobody would dast take a child to one, or if you do, they get crazy notions.  \"When I was a boy, if I got a drum and a tin horn I was so happy I couldn't keep quiet.  But last Christmas little Ulie Junior cried all day because he got a 'leven dollar automobile when he wanted a areaplane big enough to carry the cat over the barn.  \"This Christmas trust business ought to be investigated by the gov'ment and dissolved.  Talk about your tariff schedules! What we need is somebody to pare down this Christmas gouge.  It's the one kind of tax you can't swear off.  \"And as for you--why, you're goin' daffy.  Other years I didn't mind so much.  You spent a lot of time and some money on your annual splurge, but I will say, you took in better'n you gave.  But now you're on the other side the fence.  These Carthage women have got you on the run. You'll have to give 'em twice as good as they send or you're gone. You're gone anyway.  If you gave each one of 'em a gold platter full of diamonds they'd say you'd inherited Aunt Ida's stinginess as well as her money.\"  Mrs. Budlong went on twisting her fingers: \"Oh, of course you're right, Ule.  But what's the use of being right when it's so hateful?  All I can think of is that Everybody in town is going to give me a present! Everybody!\"  \"Can't you take your last year's presents and pass 'em along to other folks?\"  \"Everybody would recognize them, and I'd be the talk of the town.\"  \"You're that anyway, so what difference does it make?\"  \"I'd rather die.\"  \"You'd save a lot of money and trouble if you did.\"  \"Just look at the list of presents I must give.\"  She handed him a bundle of papers.  He pushed up his spectacles and put on his reading glasses, and instantly snorted:  \"Say!  What is this? the town directory?\"  He had not read far down the list when he missed one important name. \"You've overlooked Mrs. Alsop.\"  \"Oh, her!  I've quarreled with her.  We don't speak, thank heaven.\"  \"It would be money In your pocket, if you didn't speak to anybody. Gosh!\" he slapped his knee.  \"I have an idea.  Stop speaking to everybody.\"  \"Don't he silly.\"  \"I mean it.\"     VII  FOILED  Ulysses S. G. Budlong was a man fertile in ideas and unflinching in their execution.  Otherwise he would never have attained his present unquestioned supremacy, as the leading hay and feed merchant in Carthage.  \"It's as easy as falling off a log,\" he urged.  \"You women are always spatting about something.  Now's your chance to capitalize your spats.\"  \"Men are such im-boo-hoo-ciles!\" was Mrs. Budlong's comment, as she began to weep.  Her husband patted her with a timid awkwardness as if she were the nose of a strange horse.  \"There! there! we'll fix this up fine.  What did you quarrel with Mrs. Alsop about?\"  \"She told Sally Swezey and Sally Swezey told me--that I used my Carthage presents to send to relatives in other towns.\"  \"She flattered you at that,\" said Mr. Budlong unconsolingly.  \"But don't you dream of forgiving her till after Christmas.\"  Mrs. Budlong was having such a good cry, and enjoying the optical hath so heartily, that her grief became very precious to her.  It suggested what a beautiful thing grief is to those who make a fine art of it.  She smiled wet-liddedly.  \"There is nothing in your idea, Ulie, but it has suggested a good one to me.  I'll announce that I can't celebrate Christmas because of our great grief for Aunt Ida.\"  \"Great grief!\" Mr.  Budlong echoed.  \"Why, you couldn't have celebrated Aunt Ida's finish more joyous without you'd serenaded her in Woodlawn with a brass band.\"  \"Ulysses Budlong! you ought to be ashamed of yourself for saying such a thing!\"  But she suddenly heard, in fancy, the laugh that would go up if she sprung such an excuse.  She gave in:  \"We'll have to quarrel with somebody then.  But what excuse is there?\"  \"Women don't need any real excuse.  You simply telephone Sally Swezey that a certain person told you--and you won't name any names--that she had been making fun of you and you'd be much obliged if she never spoke to you again for you'd certainly never speak to her again.\"  \"But how do I know Sally Swezey has been making fun of me?\"  \"Oh, there ain't any doubt but what everybody in town is doing that.\"  \"Ulysses Budlong! how can you talk so!\"  \"If people without money couldn't make fun of people with--what consolation would they have?  Anyway, it's not me but the other folks you're supposed to quarrel with.  You spend an hour at that telephone and you can get the whole town by the ears.\"  \"But I can't use the same excuse for everybody.\"  \"You'll think up plenty once you put your mind to it.\"  And with that another excuse came in pat.  Came in howling and flagrant.  Ulysses Junior burst into the room, as if he had forgotten the presence of the door.  He was yelping like a coyote and from his tiny nose an astonishing amount of blood was spouting.  \"What on earth is the matter!\" the startled mother gasped.  \"Come here to me, you poor child---and be careful not to bleed on the new rug.\"  Ulysses' articulation was impeded with sobs and the oscillations of three semi-detached teeth, that waved in the breeze as he screamed: \"Little Clarence Detwiller LICKED me!  so he did! and I on'y p-pushed him off his sled into a puddle of ice wa-wa-water and he attackted me and kicked my f-f-Face-ace off.\"  Mr. and Mrs. Budlong were so elated with the same idea that they forgot to console their heart-broken offspring with more than Mr. Budlong's curt, \"First teeth anyway; saves you a trip to the dentist.\"  He nodded to his wife.  \"Just the excuse we were looking for.\"  \"Sent direct from heaven,\" nodded Mrs. Budlong.  \"You call up Roscoe Detwiller this minute and tell him his son has criminal tendencies and ought to be in jail and will undoubtedly die on the gallows.  Then he won't speak to you to-morrow.\"  \"You bet he won't.  He'll just quietly do to me what his boy did to Ulie.  No, my dear, you tell all that to Mrs. Detwiller yourself.\"  Mrs. Budlong tossed her head with fine contempt.  \"What cowards men are! always shielding themselves behind women's skirts.  Well, if you're afraid, I'm not.  I'll give her the biggest talking to she ever had in her born days.\"  She rose with fortitude and started to the telephone, sneered at it and glared at it.  Her husband stood by her to support her in the hour of need.  He watched her ask for the number, and snap ferociously at the central.  Then she fell panicky again and held the transmitter to him appealingly.  He waved her away scornfully.  She set her teeth hard and there was grimness in her eye and tone as she said: \"Is this you, Mrs. Detwiller! ---- Oh, yes, thank you, I'm very well.  I wanted to tell you-m ---- oh, yes, he's well, too.  But what I started to say was ---- Yes, so Ulie says! ------ Yes, right in the face ------ Oh, of course, ------ Naturally ------ Boys will be ------ ------ Oh, I'm sorry you punished him.  He's such a sweet "]]]
