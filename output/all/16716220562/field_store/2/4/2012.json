So the two young men passed in and enjoyed their first sample of southern cookery.  At this hour there were only a half dozen other people in the dining room--none of them interesting, Darrin decided, after hastily surveying the other diners.  The meal over, the two young candidates sauntered again out into the hotel office.  \"Any midshipmen out around the town, sir?\" Darrin asked.  \"Hardly, sir,\" replied the clerk, with a smile.  \"At this hour the young gentlemen are in their rooms at Bancroft Hall.\"  \"What does a midshipman look like?\" ventured Dalzell.  \"Like a human being, of course,\" Dave laughed.  \"You mean the uniform?\" inquired the clerk. \"A midshipman, sir, wears a dark blue uniform, like an officer's, and a visored cap, Naval pattern.  He also wears the anchor insignia on each side of his coat collar.\"  Dave and Dan soon walked over to the open doorway and stood looking out upon the street, in which, at this time, few people were passing. Hearing a step in the office, Dan quickly turned.  He saw a young man coming through the office, holding himself very erect. This young man was in dark blue uniform, with visored cap, and on each side of his collar was the anchor insignia.  Past the anchor were two bars, but Dalzell didn't notice that at the moment.  \"There's a real midshipman,\" whispered Dan, plucking at Dave's sleeve.  \"I'm going to speak to him.\"  \"Don't you do it,\" warned Dave, in an undertone.  \"You may make a mistake.\"  \"Mistake?\" echoed Dan.  \"With that anchor on his collar?\"  Hastily Dan Dalzell slipped back into the office, going up to the young man in uniform, who had stopped before the desk.  \"Good evening,\" began Dan politely.  \"I'd like to introduce myself. 'Tomorrow I expect to be one of the crowd.  You're a midshipman, aren't you?\"  \"I'm an officer of the Navy,\" replied the uniformed stranger coldly, as he half turned to glance briefly at Dalzell.  \"You are a candidate, I suppose?  Then I fancy you will report at the superintendent's office in the morning.\"  With that the Naval officer turned away, leaving poor Dalzell feeling decidedly dumfounded.  \"Wasn't that a midshipman?\" gasped Dan, in a whisper.  \"That gentleman is a lieutenant in the Navy,\" replied the clerk, with a slight smile.  Crestfallen Dan hurried back to Darrin, brushing off his sleeves with his hands as he walked.  \"Served you right; you must get over being fresh,\" Dave Darrin rebuked his chum.  \"But what is the matter with your sleeves?\"  \"I'm brushing the frost off of them,\" murmured Dan dejectedly. \"Did you notice the ice-bath that fellow threw over me?\"  \"Come out for a walk,\" urged Dave.  \"But be careful where you step and what you say to others.\"  The two young men strolled down the street.  \"Well,\" smiled Darrin, \"I must say, Dan, that you appear to be getting all over your nervousness.\"  \"No; I'm still nervous,\" protested Dan.  \"Before, I was afraid I wouldn't get into the Naval Academy.  Now, I'm only afraid that I shall.\"  \"What nonsense are you talking now?\" demanded Darrin, giving his chum a sharp look.  \"Why, if they're all going to be as chesty as that near-officer I spoke to in the hotel,\" blinked Dan, \"I'm not so sure that I want to go in with the bunch.\"  \"That officer wasn't either chesty or snobbish,\" rejoined Darrin.  \"Then you will kindly explain what he tried to do to me?\"  \"That's easy enough.  That Naval officer recognized in you a rather common type--the too-chummy and rather fresh American boy.  Down here in the service, where different grades in rank exist, it is necessary to keep the fresh greenhorn in his place.\"  \"Oh!\" muttered Dan, blinking hard.  \"As to your not wanting to go into the service,\" Dave continued, \"if you should fail, tomorrow, in your physical examination, you would be as blue as indigo, and have the blue-light signal up all the way back home.\"  \"I don't know but that is so.  Yes; I guess it is,\" Dalzell assented.  \"Now, there are at least ninety-nine chances in a hundred that you're going to pass the Navy doctors all right, Dan,\" his chum went on.  \"If you do, you'll be sworn into the Naval service as a midshipman.  Then you'll have to keep in mind that you're not an admiral, but only a midshipman--on probation, at that, as our instructions from the Navy Department inform us.  Now, as a new midshipman, you're only the smallest, greenest little boy in the whole service.  Just remember that, and drop all your jolly, all your freshness and all your patronizing ways.  Just listen and learn, Dan, and study, all the time, how to avoid being fresh. If you don't do this, I'm mighty confident that you're up against a hard and tough time, and that you'll have most of the other midshipmen down on you from the start.\"  \"Any more 'roast' for me?\" asked Dalzell plaintively.  \"No; for, if you need any more, you'll get it from other midshipmen, who don't know you as well as I do, and who won't make any allowances for your greenness and freshness.\"  \"My!\" murmured Dan enthusiastically.  \"Won't I quiver with glee the first time I see you being called for twelve-inch freshness!\"  Yet, despite their wordy encounters, the two remained, as always, the best and most loyal of friends.  For an hour and a half the two youngsters roamed about Annapolis, taking many interested looks at quaint old buildings that had stood since long before the Revolutionary War.  At last they turned back to the hotel, for, as Dalzell suggested, they needed a long night's sleep as a good preparation for going before the Naval surgeons on the next day.  Five minutes after they had turned out the gas Dave Darrin was soundly, blissfully asleep.  In another bed in the same room Dan Dalzell tossed for fully half an hour ere sleep caught his eyelids and pinned them down. In his slumber, however, Dan dreamed that he was confronting the superintendent of the Naval Academy and a group of officers, to whom he was expounding the fact that he was right and they were wrong.  What the argument was about Dan didn't see clearly, in his dream, but he had the satisfaction of making the superintendent and most of the Naval officers with him feel like a lot of justly-rebuked landsmen.     CHAPTER II  THE FIRST DAY AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY   A few minutes before nine o'clock, the next morning, Dave and Dan were strolling through Lover's Lane, not far from the administration building at the United States Naval Academy.  Their instructions bade them report at 9.15.  Dan was for going in at once and \"calling on\" the aide to the superintendent.  But this Dave vetoed, holding that the best thing for them to do was to stick to the very letter of their orders.  So, as they waited, the young men got a glimpse of the imposing piles of buildings that compose the newer Naval Academy.  Especially did handsome, big, white Bancroft Hall enchain their admiration.  This structure is one of the noblest in the country.  In it are the midshipmen's mess, the midshipmen's barracks for a thousand young men, numerous offices and a huge recreation hall.  \"That's a swell hotel where they're going to put us up for four years, isn't it?\" demanded Dan.  \"I fancy that we'll find it something more--or less--than a hotel, before we're through it,\" was Dave's prophetic reply.  As, at this time in the morning, all of the enrolled midshipmen were away at one form or another of drill or instruction, the central grounds were so empty of human life that the onlooker could form no idea of the immense, throbbing activity that was going on here among the hundreds of midshipmen on duty.  \"Here's some of our kind,\" spoke Dan, at last, as he espied more than a dozen young men, in citizen's dress, strolling along under the trees.  \"I guess they're candidates, fast enough,\" nodded Darrin, after briefly looking at the approaching group.  \"Cheap-looking lot, most of them, aren't they?\" asked Dalzell cheerfully.  \"Probably they're saying the same thing about us,\" chuckled Dave dryly.  \"Let 'em, then.  Who cares?\" muttered Dalzell.  \"Dan, my boy, I reckon you'll need to put the soft pedal on your critical tendencies,\" warned Dave.  \"And, if you want my friendly opinion, I've a big idea that you're going to talk your way into a lot of trouble here.\"  \"Trouble?\" grinned Dalzell.  \"Well, I'm used to it.\"  In truth Dan had been victor in many a hard-fought schoolboy disagreement, as readers of the High School Boys Series are aware.  As the young men in question drew nearer they eyed Darrin and Dalzell with a disapproval that was not wholly concealed.  The truth was that Dave and Dan were recognized as not being boys who had studied at one of the Naval prep. schools in Annapolis. The assumption was, therefore, that Dave and Dan had not been able to afford such a luxury.  \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" was Dave's pleasant greeting.  \"You are candidates, like ourselves, I take it?\"  This fact being acknowledged, Dave introduced himself and his friend, and soon some pleasant new acquaintances were being formed, for Darrin had a way that always made him popular with strangers.  \"Have you two got to go up before the June exams. here?\" asked one of the young men, who had introduced himself as Grigsby.  \"Part of it,\" grinned Dan.  \"We've already gone through the primer tests and the catechism, and that sort of thing; but we still have to go before the barber and the toilet specialists and see whether our personal appearance suits.\"  \"You're lucky, then,\" replied Grigsby.  \"Our crowd all have to take the academic exams.\"  \"Cheer up,\" begged Dan.  \"Any baby can go past the academic exams. Arithmetic is the hardest part.  One funny chap on the Civil Service Commission nearly got me by asking me how much two and two are, but Darrin saved me, just in the nick of time, by holding up five fingers; so I knew the answer right off.\"  Some of the candidates were already surveying Dan with a good deal of amusement."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],["title","Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#2)"],["body","had heard much of the severe way upper classmen at the Naval Academy have of taking all the freshness out of a new man, and, like Dave, these other candidates scented plenty of trouble ahead for cheerful, grinning Dan Dalzell.  \"Gentlemen,\" broke in Dave quietly, \"do you see the time on the clock over on the academic building?  It's nine-fourteen.  What do you say if we step promptly over to the administration building and plunge into what's ahead of us?\"  \"Good enough,\" nodded one of the new acquaintances.  \"Suppose you lead the way?\"  So, with Dan by his side, Dave piloted the others over to the administration building, just beyond the chapel.  As they stepped inside, and found themselves in a hallway, a marine orderly confronted them.  \"Candidates, gentlemen?  Walk right upstairs.  An orderly there will direct you to the office of the superintendent's aide.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Dave, with a bow, and led the way upstairs.  Near the head of the stairs another marine, in spick-and-span uniform, wearing white gloves and with a bayonet at his belt, called out quietly:  \"Candidates?  First two, step this way please.\"  He swung open a door.  Dave and Dan stepped into an office where they found a young-looking though slightly bald gentleman in uniform, seated behind a flat-top desk.  \"We have come to report, sir, according to our instructions,\" announced Dave Darrin, happily.  \"You are candidates, then?\" asked Lieutenant-Commander Graham, reaching for a pile of bound sheets.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Names?  \"David Darrin and Daniel Dalzell, sir.\"  \"Have you your papers, Mr. Darrin?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Dave drew an official-looking envelope from an inner pocket and handed it to Lieutenant-Commander Graham.  These the Naval aide scanned closely, after which he looked up.  \"You have your papers, Mr. Dalzell?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Dan.  A more than perceptible frown flashed across the face of the officer.  \"Mr. Dalzell, whenever you answer an officer you will say 'yes, sir,' or 'very good, sir.'\"  Rather red in the face Dan handed over his envelope.  Mr. Graham examined these papers, too.  Then, pulling a pile of blanks before him, he filled out two, bearing the names of the young men, and signed them, after which he handed one of the signed blanks to each.  \"Mr. Darrin, you will inquire of the orderly downstairs your way to the office of the commandant of midshipmen.  You will then at once present yourself before the commandant, handing him this paper.\"  \"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" replied Dave, with a slight bow.  \"Mr. Dalzell, stick close to your friend and you will find out what to do.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" murmured Dan, again reddening.  The orderly below directed the two young men how to proceed to the main entrance of Bancroft Hall, there to turn to their left and inquire again their way to the commandant's office.  \"You see,\" lectured Dave pleasantly, as the chums plodded along one of the walks, \"you have already received your first lesson. You answered the superintendent's aide without saying 'sir.'  You'll have to work out of this freshness.\"  \"That wasn't freshness; it was ignorance,\" protested Dalzell. \"Don't you worry, Dave; I shall soon get the Naval trotting gait to such an extent that I shall be saying 'sir' at every other word.\"  This declaration was more prophetic than Dalzell could guess at that moment.  Each lad had a queer feeling at heart as he began to climb the long series of white steps that lead to the main entrance to Bancroft Hall.  What would be the outcome?  Were they hence-forth to find this huge pile \"home\" for four years to come?  Would they, through all after life, look back upon this great government training school as their alma mater?  It all seemed to depend, now, on the verdict of the examining Naval surgeons!  But there was little time for thought.  Once inside, they were ushered, by a white-gloved midshipman, into the office of Commander Jephson, commandant of midshipmen.  That gentleman, also in uniform, as were all Navy officers on duty at the Academy, looked briefly as the two young men stood before him.  \"Candidates, gentlemen?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dave.  \"Your orders?\"  Each young man handed over the slip given him by the aide.  Commander Jephson scanned each sheet closely, then made some entries on a set of papers of his own.  Next the commandant touched a button on his desk.  Almost immediately footsteps were heard outside.  Another white-gloved midshipman entered, raising his hand smartly to his cap in salute.  This salute the commandant acknowledged in kind.  \"Mr. Salisbury, conduct Candidates Darrin and Dalzell outside. Ascertain how soon the surgeons will be ready to examine them, and conduct the candidates to the Board Room at the time assigned for their examination.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" replied Midshipman Salisbury, in measured tones. Again the inter-change of salutes, after which Midshipman Salisbury led Dave and Dan to an outer office.  \"Wait here,\" directed the midshipman briefly, \"I'll let you know when it's time to go to the Board Room.\"  Five minutes later the midshipman again approached them.  By this time there were seven more candidates in the room.  The aide to the superintendent and the commandant were passing the young men quickly through the mill.  \"Mr. Darrin, Mr. Dalzell!\" called the midshipman master of ceremonies. As Dave and Dan started to their feet their conductor added:  \"Follow me to the Board Room.\"  Down the corridor and into the Board Room the two chums were led. There, awaiting them, they found three Naval medical officers, all in their proper uniform and one of them seated at a desk.  \"Strip, with the least delay possible,\" ordered the senior surgeon.  In a very short space of time Dave and Dan stood forth, minus clothes and, it must be confessed, both very nervous as to what these medical men might or might not find.  Thorough, indeed, was the examination, which began with the heart. But it went much further, including the hair, scalp, eyes, teeth, the condition of the tonsils, the appearance of the tongue, and so on, by regular stages, down to the soles of their feet.  \"If there's a square quarter of an inch these fellows have missed, I didn't notice it,\" muttered Dan to himself.  \"You may dress, Mr. Darrin,\" announced the senior surgeon, and Dave went to the chair on which his clothing lay.  \"Mr. Dalzell, come here a moment\"  Dan began to feel queer.  What had they missed?  On what point was his physical condition doubtful?  \"Open your mouth,\" directed one of the surgeons.  Then followed some more exploration of his teeth.  \"Oh,\" murmured Dan, when the medical men gave him a rest for a moment.  \"It's only my teeth, eh?  That's not a vitally important point, is it, sir?\"  \"We reject candidates for what might seem very slight defects of the teeth,\" replied the senior surgeon, with emphasis.  \"Open your mouth again.\"  The cold ooze stood out on Dan's brow this time.  Joke as he might, he did not want to be dropped out of the Navy.  Were these medical officers going to find, in his mouth, the clue his disqualification?  \"Hm!\" said the senior surgeon, watching while another medical officer did the probing and the holding of the dental mirrors.  That \"hm!\" sent a cold chill of dread coursing down young Daniel's spine.  \"Your teeth just about pass,\" remarked the senior officer.  \"You may dress, Mr. Dalzell.\"  It was not long before Dave and Dan both had their clothing on. As Dan was finishing, Dave turned to the senior surgeon.  \"Is it improper, sir, for me to ask whether we have passed?\" asked Darrin quietly.  \"You have both passed,\" nodded the surgeon.  \"Mr. Dalzell, however, will do well to take the most wholesome care of his teeth hereafter.\"  Just then the door opened and two more candidates were shown in.  \"Come with me,\" directed the same midshipman master of ceremonies.  Dan was indiscreet enough to range up alongside their conductor, just missing a vigorous nudge that Dave tried to give him.  \"Well, we slipped by the drug-store sign all right,\" Dan confided to the white-gloved midshipman.  \"Now, how soon do we get our messenger-boy uniforms?  \"Never, I hope,\" replied their conductor frigidly, \"unless you can learn to speak of the uniform of the service with more respect.\"  Dan fell back abashed.  His style of humor, he was fast discovering, did not seem to make a hit at Annapolis.  Back in the same waiting room the two young men lingered until nearly eleven o'clock.  More than two score of candidates had passed the medical examiners by this time, and some others had failed to pass.  Yet many of these successful candidates had yet to take their scholastic examinations over in Academic Hall, and so did not wait with Dave and Dan, who had now passed in everything.  By eleven there were fully a dozen young men who, like Dave and Dan, were ready to be sworn in.  These were now led to the commandant's office.  Here each signed a paper agreeing to serve in the United States Navy for a term of eight years, unless sooner legally discharged. Each also signed a statement to the effect that he took this step with the full permission of parents or guardian.  Then the commandant of cadets ordered them to form in a line facing his desk.  A notary appeared, who administered to them the oath of loyalty and obedience.  These young men were at last actual members of the brigade of midshipmen.  Commander Jephson now delivered a short address to the lined-up dozen.  He pointed out where the lines of their duty lay, and exhorted them to seek their duty and to perform it at all times. In closing the commandant put emphasis on these words:  \"One word more, young gentlemen.  Until this moment perhaps all of you have been wont to look upon yourself as boys.  That time has passed.  From the moment that you were sworn into the Navy of the United State--remember--you became men.  All of your superior officers will now look to you to realize most fully that you are men--men in word,"]]]
