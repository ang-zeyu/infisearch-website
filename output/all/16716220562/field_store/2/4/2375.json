There were not the facilities in those days as now for the spreading of news, there being but few telegraph lines in the State. Notwithstanding this, every method possible was put into practice for gathering in the troops. There were no assemblages of troops outside of Charleston. Men were following their daily vocations. Extra trains were put in motion; couriers dashed with rapid speed across the country. Private means, as well as public, were resorted to to arouse the men and bring them to the front. Officers warned the private, and he in turn rode with all the speed his horse, loosed from the plow, could command, to arouse his comrades. It was on Saturday when word was first sent out, but it was late the next day (Sunday) before men in the remote rural districts received the stirring notice. Men left their plows standing in the field, not to return under four years, and many of them never. Carpenters came down from the unfinished roof, or left their bench with work half finished. The student who had left his school on the Friday before never recited his Monday's lesson. The country doctor left his patients to the care of the good housewife. Many people had gone to church and in places the bells were still tolling, calling the worshippers together to listen to the good and faithful teachings of the Bible, but the sermon was never delivered or listened to. Hasty preparations were made everywhere. The loyal wives soon had the husband's clothes in the homemade knapsack; the mother buckled on the girdle of her son, while the gray haired father was burning with impatience, only sorrowing that he, too, could not go. Never before in the history of the world, not even in Carthage or Sparta, was there ever such a spontaneous outburst of patriotic feeling; never such a cheerful and willing answer to the call of a mother country. Not a regret, not a tear; no murmuring or reproaches--not one single complaint. Never did the faithful Scott give with better grace his sons for the defense of his beloved chief, \"Eric,\" than did the fathers and mothers of South Carolina give their sons for the defense of the beloved Southland.  The soldiers gathered at the railroad stations, and as the trains that had been sent to the farthest limits of the State came along, the troops boarded them and hurried along to Charleston, then the seat of war. General M.L. Bonham had been appointed Major General of State troops and called his brigades together. Colonel Gregg was already in Charleston with the First Regiment. Col. Joseph B. Kershaw with the Second, Colonel James H. Williams with the Third, Colonel Thomas Bacon with the Seventh, and Colonel E.B.C. Cash with the Eighth, formed their regiments by gathering the different companies along at the various railroad stations. The Second, Seventh, and Eighth came on to Charleston, reaching there while the bombardment was still in progress, but not early enough to take active part in the battle. Colonel Williams with the Third, for want of transportation, was stopped in Columbia, and took up quarters in the Fair Grounds. The other regiments went into camp in the suburbs of Charleston and on the islands. After the surrender of Sumter the troops on the islands and mainland returned to their old quarters to talk upon the incidents of the battle, write home of the memorable events and to rejoice generally. Almost as many rumors were now afloat as there were men in the army. It was the generally conceded opinion of all that the war was at an end. A great many of the Southern leaders boasted of \"drinking all the blood that would be shed in the war.\" The whole truth of the entire matter was, both sections underrated each other. The South, proud and haughty, looked with disdain upon the courage of the North; considered the people cowardly, and not being familiar with firearms would be poor soldiers; that the rank and file of the North, being of a foreign, or a mixture of foreign blood, would not remain loyal to the Union, as the leaders thought, and would not fight. While the North looked upon the South as a set of aristocratic blusterers, their affluence and wealth having made them effeminate; a nation of weaklings, who could not stand the fatigues and hardships of a campaign. Neither understood the other, overrating themselves and underrating the strength of their antagonists. When Lincoln first called for 50,000 troops and several millions of dollars for equipment and conduct of the war, the South would ask in derision, \"Where would he get them?\" When the South would talk of resistance, the North would ask, \"Where are her soldiers?\" \"The rich planters' sons cannot fight.\" \"The poor man will not do battle for the negroes of the rich.\" \"The South has no arms, no money, no credit.\" So each mistook the strength, motives, spirits, and sentiments that actuated the other. A great change came over the feelings of the North after the fall of Sumter. They considered that their flag had been insulted, their country dishonored. Where there had been differences before at the North, there was harmony now. The conservative press of that section was now defiant and called for war; party differences were healed and the Democratic party of the North that had always affiliated in national affairs with the South, was now bitter against their erring sisters, and cried loudly for \"Union or coercion.\" The common people of the North were taught to believe that the Nation had been irretrievably dishonored and disgraced, that the disruption of the Union was a death knell to Republican institutions and personal liberty. That the liberty and independence that their ancestors had won by their blood in the Revolution was now to be scattered to the four winds of heaven by a few fanatical slave holders at the South. But up to this time the question of slavery had not been brought into controversy on either side. It was not discussed and was only an after thought, a military necessity.  Virginia, three days after the fall of Sumter, joined her sister State. This act of the old commonwealth was hailed in the Gulf States with great rejoicing. Bells tolled and cannon boomed and men hurrahed. Until now it was not certain what stand would be taken by the Border States. They did not wish to leave the Union; neither would they be a party to a war upon their seceding sisters. They promised to be neutral. But President Lincoln soon dispelled all doubt and uncertainty by his proclamation, calling upon all States then remaining in the Union to furnish their quota of troops. They were then forced to take sides for or against and were not long in reaching a conclusion. As soon as conventions could be assembled, the States joined the Confederacy and began levying troops to resist invasion. Tennessee followed Virginia, then Arkansas, the Old North State being the last of the Atlantic and Gulf States to cross the Rubicon into the \"plains of Southern independence.\" The troops that had been called for six months were now disbanded, and those who had enlisted for twelve months for State service were called upon to volunteer in the Confederate Army for the unexpired time. They volunteered almost without a dissenting voice. Having left their homes so hurriedly, they were granted a furlough of a week or ten days to return to their families and put their houses in order. They then returned and went into a camp of instruction.  General Bonham had not gotten all of his regiments together up to this time. The Second, Seventh, and Eighth were around Charleston, while the Third was at Lightwood Knot Spring, four miles from Columbia. This camp was called \"Camp Williams,\" in honor of their Colonel. That in Columbia was called \"Camp Ruffin,\" in honor of General Ruffin. It was customary to give all the different camps a name during the first year's service, generally in honor of some favorite officer or statesman. Colonel Gregg's regiment remained on Morris Island until early in May, when it was sent to Norfolk, Va., to take charge of the large amount of government property there, now very valuable to the South.  At the reorganization of the First Regiment I came to Columbia and joined the company I had before enlisted in. I had two older brothers there, and I was given a place as Second Sergeant in the company.  At the secession of South Carolina, Colonel Williams was in Arkansas, where he had large estates, but on being notified of his election, he joined his regiment while at Lightwood Knot Springs. He was met at the railroad by his troops with great demonstrations of joy and pride. Stalwart men hoisted him upon their shoulders and carried him through the camp, followed by a throng of shouting and delighted soldiers. The regiment had been commanded up to that time by Lieutenant Colonel Foster, of Spartanburg, with James M. Baxter as Major, D.R. Rutherford as Adjutant, Dr. D.E. Ewart Surgeon, John McGowan Quartermaster.  Cadets were sent from the Citadel as drill masters to all the regiments, and for six hours daily the ears were greeted with \"hep-hep\" to designate the \"left\" foot \"down\" while on the drill. It took great patience, determination, and toil to bring the men under military discipline. Fresh from the fields, shops, and schools they had been accustomed to the freedom of home life, and with all their patriotism, it took time to break into the harness of military restraint and discipline these lovers of personal freedom. Many amusing incidents occurred while breaking these \"wild colts,\" but all took it good humoredly, and the best of feelings existed between officers and men. Some few, however, were nettled by the restraint and forced obedience to those whom they had heretofore been accustomed to look upon as equals, but now suddenly made"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13124"],["title","History of Kershaw's Brigade (#8)"],["body","iors. The great majority entered upon the duties of camp life with rare good will. All were waiting patiently the call to Virginia. Here I will give a short description of the regiments and their officers up to the time that all were brought together as a brigade. After that time we will treat them as a whole.  The regiments were uniformed by private donations, each neighborhood uniforming the company raised in its bounds. The tents were large and old fashioned--about 8 x 10 feet square, with a separate fly on top--one of these being allowed to every six or seven men. They were pitched in rows, about fifty feet apart, the front of one company facing the rear of the other. About the first of June all the regiments, except the Second, were ordered to Manassas, Va. The regiments were formed by companies from battalions of the militia from various counties, one company usually being formed from a battalion. These companies were organized into regiments, very much as at present, and like the old anti-bellum militia. At times some ambitious citizen would undertake to raise a volunteer company outside of those raised from battalions, and generally these were called \"crack companies.\" Afterwards a few undertook to raise companies in this manner, i.e., selecting the officers first, and then proceeding to select the men, refusing such as would not make acceptable soldiers, thus forming exclusive organizations. These were mostly formed in towns and cities. At other times old volunteer companies, as they were called, of the militia would enlist in a body, with such recruits as were wanted to fill up the number. In the old militia service almost all the towns and cities had these companies as a kind of city organization, and they would be handsomely uniformed, well equipped, and in many cases were almost equal to regular soldiers. Columbia had at least three of these companies in our brigade--the Governor's Guards, Richland Rifles, and one more, I think, but on this point am not positive. Charleston had two or more, the Palmetto Guards and others; Greenville, the Butler Guards; Newberry, the Quitman Rifles; while the other counties, Abbeville, Anderson, Edgefield, Williamsburg, Darlington, Sumter, and almost all the counties represented in our brigade had one of these city volunteer companies. When all the companies called for had been organized, they were notified to what regiment they had been assigned, or what companies were to constitute a regiment, and were ordered to hold an election for field officers. Each company would hold its election, candidates in the meantime having offered their services to fill the respective places of Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, and Major. After the elections thus held, the returns would be sent up to the Adjutant and Inspector General's office and there tabulated, and the result declared. The candidates for field officers were generally Mexican War Veterans, or some popular citizen, whom the old men thought \"would take care of the boys.\" At first the qualification of a commander, be it Colonel or Captain, mostly required was clemency. His rules of discipline, bravery, or military ability were not so much taken into consideration.         *       *       *       *       *   SECOND SOUTH CAROLINA REGIMENT.  Early in May or the last of April four companies of the Second Regiment, under Colonel Kershaw, volunteered for Confederate service, and were sent at once to Virginia. These companies were commanded by--      Captain John D. Kennedy, Kershaw County. Captain W.H. Casson,     Richland County. Captain William Wallace, Richland County.     Captain John Richardson, Sumter County.  They were afterwards joined by companies under--      Captain Ferryman, of Abbeville County, (formerly of the     Seventh Regiment). Captain Cuthbert, Charleston. Captain     Rhett, Charleston. Captain Haile, Kershaw. Captain McManus,     Lancaster. Captain Hoke, Greenville.  These were among the first soldiers from the \"Palmetto State\" to go to Virginia, and the regiment when fully organized stood as follows:      J.B. Kershaw, Colonel, of Camden. E.P. Jones, Lieutenant     Colonel. Fred Gaillard, Major. A.D. Goodwin, Adjutant.      Company A--W.H. Casson, Richland. Company B--A.D. Hoke,     Greenville. Company C--William Wallace, Richland. Company     D--T.S. Richardson. Company E--John D. Kennedy, Kershaw.     Company F--W.W.Perryman, Anderson. Company G--I. Haile,     Kershaw. Company H--H. McManus, Lancaster. Company I--G.B.     Cuthbert, Charleston. Company K--R. Rhett, Charleston.     Surgeon--Dr. F. Salmond, Kershaw. Quartermaster--W.S.     Wood, Columbia. Commissary--J.J. Villipigue. Chaplain--A.J.     McGruder.         *       *       *       *       *   THIRD SOUTH CAROLINA REGIMENT.  The Third Regiment had originally twelve companies enlisted for State service, but in transferring to Confederate Army only ten were allowed by the army regulations. Two companies were left out, viz.: Captain J.C.S. Brown's, from Newberry, and Captain Mat. Jones', from Laurens. The privates, however, enlisted in the other companies as a general rule, for the companies were allowed a maximum number of 100. The Eighth and Third made no changes in their companies or officers from their first enlistment in the State service until their second enlistment in 1862, only as occasioned by resignations or the casualties of war. The two regiments remained as first organized, with few exceptions.  The Third stood, when ready for transportation to Virginia, the 7th of June, as follows:      James H. Williams, Colonel, Newberry. B.B. Foster, Lieutenant     Colonel, Spartanburg. James M. Baxter, Major, Newberry. W.D.     Rutherford, Adjutant, Newberry.      Company A--B. Conway Garlington, Laurens. Company B--S. Newton     Davidson, Newberry. Company C--R.C. Maffett, Newberry. Company     D--T.B. Furgerson, Spartanburg and Union. Company E--James D.     Nance, Newberry. Company F--T. Walker, Newberry and Laurens.     Company G--R.P. Todd, Laurens. Company H--D. Nunnamaker,     Lexington. Company I--Smith L. Jones, Laurens. Company     K--Benj. Kennedy, Spartanburg. Surgeon--Dr. D.E.     Ewart, Newberry. Quartermaster--John McGowan, Laurens.     Commissary--Sergeant J.N. Martin, Newberry. Chaplain--Rev.     Mayfield.         *       *       *       *       *   SEVENTH SOUTH CAROLINA REGIMENT. Colonel, Thomas G. Bacon.  The following companies were from Abbeville:      Company A, Captain W.W. Perryman. Company B, Captain G.M.     Mattison. Company C, Captain P.H. Bradley. Company D, Captain     S.J. Hester.  The following companies were from Edgefield:      Company E, Captain D. Dendy. Company F, Captain John S. Hard.     Company G, Captain J. Hampden Brooks. Company H, Captain     Elbert Bland. Company I, Captain W.E. Prescott. Company K,     Captain Bart Talbert.  Captain Perryman with his company, the \"Secession Guards,\" volunteered for the Confederate service before the other companies, and left for Virginia on April 28th and joined the Second South Carolina Regiment. Captain Bland took his place with his company in the regiment as Company A.  The companies of the Seventh came together as a regiment at the Schutzenplatz, near Charleston, on the 16th of April. In about two weeks it was ordered to Edgefield District at a place called Montmorenci, in Aiken County. While here a company came from Edgefield County near Trenton, under Captain Coleman, and joined the regiment. But this company failed to enlist.  The Seventh Regiment elected as officers: Colonel, Thomas G. Bacon, of Edgefield District; lieutenant Colonel, Robert A. Fair, of Abbeville; Major, Emmet Seibles, of Edgefield; Adjutant, D. Wyatt Aiken, of Abbeville. All the staff officers were appointed by the Colonels until the transfer to the Confederate service; then the medical department was made a separate branch, and the Surgeons and Assistant Surgeons were appointed by the Department. Colonel Bacon appointed on his staff: B.F. Lovelass, Quartermaster; Fred Smith, Commissary; afterwards A.F. Townsend.  Surgeon Joseph W. Hearst resigned, and A.R. Drogie was made Surgeon in his stead, with Dr. G.H. Waddell as Assistant Surgeon. A.C. Stallworth, Sergeant Major, left for Virginia about the first of June and joined the Second a few days afterwards.         *       *       *       *       *   EIGHTH SOUTH CAROLINA REGIMENT.  The Eighth Regiment was organized early in the year 1861, but the companies were not called together until the 14th day of April, arriving in Charleston in the afternoon of that day, just after the fall of Fort Sumter. It was composed of ten companies, as follows: Three from Chesterfield, two from Marion, two from Marlborough, and three from Darlington, with Colonel, E.B.C. Cash; Lieutenant Colonel, John W. Henagan; Major, Thomas E. Lucas; Adjutant, C.B. Weatherly.  Companies first taken to Virginia:      Company A--A.I. Hoole, Darlington.     Company B--M.I. Hough, Chesterfield.     Company C--Wm. H. Coit, Chesterfield.     Company D--John S. Miller, Chesterfield.     Company E--W.E. Jay, Darlington.     Company F--W.H. Evans, Darlington.     Company G--John W. Harrington, Marlboro.     Company H--R.L. Singletary, Marion.     Company I--T.E. Stackhouse, Marion.     Company K--D. McD. McLeod, Marlboro.  After remaining in Charleston until the 4th of May it was moved to Florence. On the 1st of June the regiment re-enlisted for Confederate service. They were ordered to Richmond and arrived there on June 4th, and left on the 15th to join the Second then at Bull Run. On the 22nd of June they went into camp at Germantown, near Fairfax Court House, where all the regiments were soon joined together as Bonhams' Brigade.  The first real exciting incident connected with the Third South Carolina Regiment--the first panic and stampede--happened as the troops were returning from their ten days' furlough to their camp of instruction, near Columbia, just after their enlistment "]]]
