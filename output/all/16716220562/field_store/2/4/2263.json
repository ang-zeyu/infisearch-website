At the time of the quarrel the high officials    present prevented Asano Takumi no Kami from carrying out his    intention of killing his enemy, my Lord Kôtsuké no Suké. So    Asano Takumi no Kami died without having avenged himself, and    this was more than his retainers could endure. It is impossible    to remain under the same heaven with the enemy of lord or    father; for this reason we have dared to declare enmity against    a personage of so exalted rank. This day we shall attack Kira    Kôtsuké no Suké, in order to finish the deed of vengeance which    was begun by our dead lord. If any honourable person should    find our bodies after death, he is respectfully requested to    open and read this document.     \"15th year of Genroku. 12th month.     \"Signed, OISHI KURANOSUKÉ, Retainer of Asano    Takumi no Kami, and forty-six others.\"[6]  [Footnote 6: It is usual for a Japanese, when bent upon some deed of violence, the end of which, in his belief, justifies the means, to carry about with him a document, such as that translated above, in which he sets forth his motives, that his character may be cleared after death.]  The third manuscript is a paper which the Forty-seven Rônins laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké:--     \"The 15th year of Genroku, the 12th month, and 15th day. We    have come this day to do homage here, forty-seven men in all,    from Oishi Kuranosuké down to the foot-soldier, Terasaka    Kichiyémon, all cheerfully about to lay down our lives on your    behalf. We reverently announce this to the honoured spirit of    our dead master. On the 14th day of the third month of last    year our honoured master was pleased to attack Kira Kôtsuké no    Suké, for what reason we know not. Our honoured master put an    end to his own life, but Kira Kôtsuké no Suké lived. Although    we fear that after the decree issued by the Government this    plot of ours will be displeasing to our honoured master, still    we, who have eaten of your food, could not without blushing    repeat the verse, 'Thou shalt not live under the same heaven    nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,'    nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves    before you in paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance    which you began. Every day that we waited seemed as three    autumns to us. Verily, we have trodden the snow for one day,    nay, for two days, and have tasted food but once. The old and    decrepit, the sick and ailing, have come forth gladly to lay    down their lives. Men might laugh at us, as at grasshoppers    trusting in the strength of their arms, and thus shame our    honoured lord; but we could not halt in our deed of vengeance.    Having taken counsel together last night, we have escorted my    Lord Kôtsuké no Suké hither to your tomb. This dirk,[7] by    which our honoured lord set great store last year, and    entrusted to our care, we now bring back. If your noble spirit    be now present before this tomb, we pray you, as a sign, to    take the dirk, and, striking the head of your enemy with it a    second time, to dispel your hatred for ever. This is the    respectful statement of forty-seven men.\"  [Footnote 7: The dirk with which Asano Takumi no Kumi disembowelled himself and with which Oishi Kuranosuké cut off Kôtsuké no Suké's head.]  The text, \"Thou shalt not live under the same heaven with the enemy of thy father,\" is based upon the Confucian books. Dr. Legge, in his \"Life and Teachings of Confucius,\" p. 113, has an interesting paragraph summing up the doctrine of the sage upon the subject of revenge.     \"In the second book of the 'Le Ke' there is the following    passage:--'With the slayer of his father a man may not live    under the same heaven; against the slayer of his brother a man    must never have to go home to fetch a weapon; with the slayer    of his friend a man may not live in the same State.' The _lex    talionis_ is here laid down in its fullest extent. The 'Chow    Le' tells us of a provision made against the evil consequences    of the principle by the appointment of a minister called 'The    Reconciler.' The provision is very inferior to the cities of    refuge which were set apart by Moses for the manslayer to flee    to from the fury of the avenger. Such as it was, however, it    existed, and it is remarkable that Confucius, when consulted on    the subject, took no notice of it, but affirmed the duty of    blood-revenge in the strongest and most unrestricted terms. His    disciple, Tsze Hea, asked him, 'What course is to be pursued in    the murder of a father or mother?' He replied, 'The son must    sleep upon a matting of grass with his shield for his pillow;    he must decline to take office; he must not live under the same    heaven with the slayer. When he meets him in the market-place    or the court, he must have his weapon ready to strike him.'    'And what is the course in the murder of a brother?' 'The    surviving brother must not take office in the same State with    the slayer; yet, if he go on his prince's service to the State    where the slayer is, though he meet him, he must not fight with    him.' 'And what is the course in the murder of an uncle or    cousin?' 'In this case the nephew or cousin is not the    principal. If the principal, on whom the revenge devolves, can    take it, he has only to stand behind with his weapon in his    hand, and support him.'\"  I will add one anecdote to show the sanctity which is attached to the graves of the Forty-seven. In the month of September 1868, a certain man came to pray before the grave of Oishi Chikara. Having finished his prayers, he deliberately performed _hara-kiri_,[8] and, the belly wound not being mortal, dispatched himself by cutting his throat. Upon his person were found papers setting forth that, being a Rônin and without means of earning a living, he had petitioned to be allowed to enter the clan of the Prince of Chôshiu, which he looked upon as the noblest clan in the realm; his petition having been refused, nothing remained for him but to die, for to be a Rônin was hateful to him, and he would serve no other master than the Prince of Chôshiu: what more fitting place could he find in which to put an end to his life than the graveyard of these Braves? This happened at about two hundred yards' distance from my house, and when I saw the spot an hour or two later, the ground was all bespattered with blood, and disturbed by the death-struggles of the man.  [Footnote 8: A purist in Japanese matters may object to the use of the words _hara-kiri_ instead of the more elegant expression _Seppuku_. I retain the more vulgar form as being better known, and therefore more convenient.]     THE LOVES OF GOMPACHI AND KOMURASAKI   Within two miles or so from Yedo, and yet well away from the toil and din of the great city, stands the village of Meguro. Once past the outskirts of the town, the road leading thither is bounded on either side by woodlands rich in an endless variety of foliage, broken at intervals by the long, low line of villages and hamlets. As we draw near to Meguro, the scenery, becoming more and more rustic, increases in beauty. Deep shady lanes, bordered by hedgerows as luxurious as any in England, lead down to a valley of rice fields bright with the emerald green of the young crops. To the right and to the left rise knolls of fantastic shape, crowned with a profusion of Cryptomerias, Scotch firs and other cone-bearing trees, and fringed with thickets of feathery bamboos, bending their stems gracefully to the light summer breeze. Wherever there is a spot shadier and pleasanter to look upon than the rest, there may be seen the red portal of a shrine which the simple piety of the country folk has raised to Inari Sama, the patron god of farming, or to some other tutelary deity of the place. At the eastern outlet of the valley a strip of blue sea bounds the horizon; westward are the distant mountains. In the foreground, in front of a farmhouse, snug-looking, with its roof of velvety-brown thatch, a troop of sturdy urchins, suntanned and stark naked, are frisking in the wildest gambols, all heedless of the scolding voice of the withered old grandam who sits spinning and minding the house, while her son and his wife are away toiling at some outdoor labour. Close at our feet runs a stream of pure water, in which a group of countrymen are washing the vegetables which they will presently shoulder and carry off to sell by auction in the suburbs of Yedo. Not the least beauty of the scene consists in the wondrous clearness of an atmosphere so transparent that the most distant outlines are scarcely dimmed, while the details of the nearer ground stand out in sharp, bold relief, now lit by the rays of a vertical sun, now darkened under the flying shadows thrown by the fleecy clouds which sail across the sky. Under such a heaven, what painter could limn the lights and shades which flit over the woods, the pride of Japan, whether in late autumn, when the russets and yellows of our own trees are mixed with the deep crimson glow of the maples, or in spring-time, when plum and cherry trees and wild camellias--giants, fifty feet high--are in full blossom?  All that we see is enchanting, but there is a strange stillness in the groves; rarely does the song of a bird break the silence; indeed, I know but one warbler whose note has any music in it, the _uguisu_, by some enthusiasts called the Japanese nightingale--at best, a king in the kingdom of the blind. The scarcity of animal life of all descriptions, man and mosquitoes alone excepted, is a standing wonder to the traveller; the sportsman must toil many a weary mile to get a shot at boar, or deer, or pheasant; and the plough of the farmer and the trap of the poacher, who works in and out of season, threaten to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],["title","Tales of Old Japan (#6)"],["body","all wild creatures; unless, indeed, the Government should, as they threatened in the spring of 1869, put in force some adaptation of European game-laws. But they are lukewarm in the matter; a little hawking on a duck-pond satisfies the cravings of the modern Japanese sportsman, who knows that, game-laws or no game-laws, the wild fowl will never fail in winter; and the days are long past when my Lord the Shogun used to ride forth with a mighty company to the wild places about Mount Fuji, there camping out and hunting the boar, the deer, and the wolf, believing that in so doing he was fostering a manly and military spirit in the land.  There is one serious drawback to the enjoyment of the beauties of the Japanese country, and that is the intolerable affront which is continually offered to one's sense of smell; the whole of what should form the sewerage of the city is carried out on the backs of men and horses, to be thrown upon the fields; and, if you would avoid the overpowering nuisance, you must walk handkerchief in hand, ready to shut out the stench which assails you at every moment.  It would seem natural, while writing of the Japanese country, to say a few words about the peasantry, their relation to the lord of the soil, and their government. But these I must reserve for another place. At present our dealings are with the pretty village of Meguro.  At the bottom of a little lane, close to the entrance of the village, stands an old shrine of the Shintô (the form of hero-worship which existed in Japan before the introduction of Confucianism or of Buddhism), surrounded by lofty Cryptomerias. The trees around a Shintô shrine are specially under the protection of the god to whom the altar is dedicated; and, in connection with them, there is a kind of magic still respected by the superstitious, which recalls the waxen dolls, through the medium of which sorcerers of the middle ages in Europe, and indeed those of ancient Greece, as Theocritus tells us, pretended to kill the enemies of their clients. This is called _Ushi no toki mairi,_ or \"going to worship at the hour of the ox,\"[9] and is practised by jealous women who wish to be revenged upon their faithless lovers.  [Footnote 9: The Chinese, and the Japanese following them, divide the day of twenty-four hours into twelve periods, each of which has a sign something like the signs of the Zodiac:--   Midnight until two in the morning is represented by the rat.     2 a.m.  \"     4 a.m.          \"            \"          ox.     4 a.m.  \"     6 a.m.          \"            \"          tiger.     6 a.m.  \"     8 a.m.          \"            \"          hare.     8 a.m.  \"    10 a.m.          \"            \"          dragon.    10 a.m.  \"    12 noon          \"            \"          snake.    12 noon  \"     2 p.m.          \"            \"          horse.     2 p.m.  \"     4 p.m.          \"            \"          ram.     4 p.m.  \"     6 p.m.          \"            \"          ape.     6 p.m.  \"     8 p.m.          \"            \"          cock.     8 p.m.  \"    10 p.m.          \"            \"          hog.    10 p.m.  \"    Midnight         \"            \"          fox.]  When the world is at rest, at two in the morning, the hour of which the ox is the symbol, the woman rises; she dons a white robe and high sandals or clogs; her coif is a metal tripod, in which are thrust three lighted candles; around her neck she hangs a mirror, which falls upon her bosom; in her left hand she carries a small straw figure, the effigy of the lover who has abandoned her, and in her right she grasps a hammer and nails, with which she fastens the figure to one of the sacred trees that surround the shrine. There she prays for the death of the traitor, vowing that, if her petition be heard, she will herself pull out the nails which now offend the god by wounding the mystic tree. Night after night she comes to the shrine, and each night she strikes in two or more nails, believing that every nail will shorten her lover's life, for the god, to save his tree, will surely strike him dead.  Meguro is one of the many places round Yedo to which the good citizens flock for purposes convivial or religious, or both; hence it is that, cheek by jowl with the old shrines and temples, you will find many a pretty tea-house, standing at the rival doors of which Mesdemoiselles Sugar, Wave of the Sea, Flower, Seashore, and Chrysanthemum are pressing in their invitations to you to enter and rest. Not beautiful these damsels, if judged by our standard, but the charm of Japanese women lies in their manner and dainty little ways, and the tea-house girl, being a professional decoy-duck, is an adept in the art of flirting,--_en tout bien tout honneur_, be it remembered; for she is not to be confounded with the frail beauties of the Yoshiwara, nor even with her sisterhood near the ports open to foreigners, and to their corrupting influence. For, strange as it seems, our contact all over the East has an evil effect upon the natives.  In one of the tea-houses a thriving trade is carried on in the sale of wooden tablets, some six inches square, adorned with the picture of a pink cuttlefish on a bright blue ground. These are ex-votos, destined to be offered up at the Temple of Yakushi Niurai, the Buddhist Æsculapius, which stands opposite, and concerning the foundation of which the following legend is told.  In the days of old there was a priest called Jikaku, who at the age of forty years, it being the autumn of the tenth year of the period called Tenchô (A.D. 833), was suffering from disease of the eyes, which had attacked him three years before. In order to be healed from this disease he carved a figure of Yakushi Niurai, to which he used to offer up his prayers. Five years later he went to China, taking with him the figure as his guardian saint, and at a place called Kairetsu it protected him from robbers and wild beasts and from other calamities. There he passed his time in studying the sacred laws both hidden and revealed, and after nine years set sail to return to Japan. When he was on the high seas a storm arose, and a great fish attacked and tried to swamp the ship, so that the rudder and mast were broken, and the nearest shore being that of a land inhabited by devils, to retreat or to advance was equally dangerous. Then the holy man prayed to the patron saint whose image he carried, and as he prayed, behold the true Yakushi Niurai appeared in the centre of the ship, and said to him--  \"Verily, thou hast travelled far that the sacred laws might be revealed for the salvation of many men; now, therefore, take my image, which thou carriest in thy bosom, and cast it into the sea, that the wind may abate, and that thou mayest be delivered from this land of devils.\"  The commands of the saints must be obeyed, so with tears in his eyes, the priest threw into the sea the sacred image which he loved. Then did the wind abate, and the waves were stilled, and the ship went on her course as though she were being drawn by unseen hands until she reached a safe haven. In the tenth month of the same year the priest again set sail, trusting to the power of his patron saint, and reached the harbour of Tsukushi without mishap. For three years he prayed that the image which he had cast away might be restored to him, until at last one night he was warned in a dream that on the sea-shore at Matsura Yakushi Niurai would appear to him. In consequence of this dream he went to the province of Hizen, and landed on the sea-shore at Hirato, where, in the midst of a blaze of light, the image which he had carved appeared to him twice, riding on the back of a cuttlefish. Thus was the image restored to the world by a miracle. In commemoration of his recovery from the disease of the eyes and of his preservation from the dangers of the sea, that these things might be known to all posterity, the priest established the worship of Tako Yakushi Niurai (\"Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish\") and came to Meguro, where he built the Temple of Fudô Sama,[10] another Buddhist divinity. At this time there was an epidemic of small-pox in the village, so that men fell down and died in the street, and the holy man prayed to Fudô Sama that the plague might be stayed. Then the god appeared to him, and said--  \"The saint Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish, whose image thou carriest, desires to have his place in this village, and he will heal this plague. Thou shalt, therefore, raise a temple to him here that not only this small-pox, but other diseases for future generations, may be cured by his power.\"  [Footnote 10: Fudô, literally \"the motionless\": Buddha in the state called Nirvana.]  Hearing this, the priest shed tears of gratitude, and having chosen a piece of fine wood, carved a large figure of his patron saint of the cuttlefish, and placed the smaller image inside of the larger, and laid it up in this temple, to which people still flock that they may be healed of their diseases.  Such is the story of the miracle, translated from a small ill-printed pamphlet sold by the priests of the temple, all the decorations of which, even to a bronze lantern in the middle of the yard, are in the form of a cuttlefish, the sacred emblem of the place.  What pleasanter lounge in which to while away a hot day could a man wish for than the shade of the trees borne by the hill on which stands the Temple of Fudô Sama? Two jets of pure water springing from the rock are voided by spouts carved in the shape of dragons into a stone basin enclosed by rails, within which it is written that \"no woman may enter.\" If you are in luck, you may cool yourself by watching some devotee, naked save his loin-cloth, performing the ceremony called _Suigiyô_; that is to say, praying under the waterfall that his soul may be purified through his body. In winter it requires no small pluck to go through this penance, yet I have seen a penitent submit to it for more than a quarter of an hour on a bitterly cold day in "]]]
