His talents and eloquence soon raised him to distinction in public life. He acted with the Liberal party until its break-up under the Irish policy of Mr. Gladstone, after which he was one of the Unionist leaders. He held the offices of Lord Privy Seal, Postmaster-General, and Indian Secretary. His writings include _The Reign of Law_ (1866), _Primeval Man_ (1869), _The Eastern Question_ (1879), _The Unseen Foundations of Society_ (1893), _Philosophy of Belief_ (1896), _Organic Evolution Cross-examined_ (1898). He was a man of the highest character, honest, courageous, and clear-sighted, and, though regarded by some professional scientists as to a certain extent an amateur, his ability, knowledge, and dialectic power made him a formidable antagonist, and enabled him to exercise a useful, generally conservative, influence on scientific thought and progress.   ARMSTRONG, JOHN, M.D. (1709-1779).--Poet, _s._ of the minister of Castleton, Roxburghshire, studied medicine, which he practised in London. He is remembered as the friend of Thomson, Mallet, and other literary celebrities of the time, and as the author of a poem on _The Art of Preserving Health_, which appeared in 1744, and in which a somewhat unpromising subject for poetic treatment is gracefully and ingeniously handled. His other works, consisting of some poems and prose essays, and a drama, _The Forced Marriage_, are forgotten, with the exception of the four stanzas at the end of the first part of Thomson's _Castle of Indolence_, describing the diseases incident to sloth, which he contributed.   ARNOLD, SIR EDWIN (1832-1904).--Poet, _s._ of a Sussex magistrate, was _b._ at Gravesend, and _ed._ at King's School, Rochester, London, and Oxford. Thereafter he was an assistant master at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and was in 1856 appointed Principal of the Government Deccan College, Poona. Here he received the bias towards, and gathered material for, his future works. In 1861 he returned to England and became connected with _The Daily Telegraph_, of which he was ultimately editor. The literary task which he set before him was the interpretation in English verse of the life and philosophy of the East. His chief work with this object is _The Light of Asia_ (1879), a poem on the life and teaching of Buddha, which had great popularity, but whose permanent place in literature must remain very uncertain. In _The Light of the World_ (1891), he attempted, less successfully, a similar treatment of the life and teaching of Jesus. Other works are _The Song of Songs of India_ (1875), _With Saadi in the Garden_, and _The Tenth Muse_. He travelled widely in the East, and wrote books on his travels. He was made K.C.I.E. in 1888.   ARNOLD, MATTHEW (1822-1888).--Poet and critic, _s._ of Dr. A., of Rugby (_q.v._), was _b._ at Laleham and _ed._ at Rugby, Winchester, and Balliol Coll., Oxford, becoming a Fellow of Oriel in 1845. Thereafter he was private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, Lord President of the Council, through whose influence he was in 1851 appointed an inspector of schools. Two years before this he had _pub._ his first book of poetry, _The Strayed Reveller_, which he soon withdrew: some of the poems, however, including \"Mycerinus\" and \"The Forsaken Merman,\" were afterwards republished, and the same applies to his next book, _Empedocles on Etna_ (1852), with \"Tristram and Iseult.\" In 1857 he was appointed to the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford, which he held for ten years. After this he produced little poetry and devoted himself to criticism and theology. His principal writings are, in poetry, _Poems_ (1853), containing \"Sohrab and Rustum,\" and \"The Scholar Gipsy;\" _Poems, 2nd Series_ (1855), containing \"Balder Dead;\" _Merope_ (1858); _New Poems_ (1867), containing \"Thyrsis,\" an elegy on A.H. Clough (_q.v._), \"A Southern Night,\" \"Rugby Chapel,\" and \"The Weary Titan\"; in prose he wrote _On Translating Homer_ (1861 and 1862), _On the Study of Celtic Literature_ (1867), _Essays in Celtic Literature_ (1868), _2nd Series_ (1888), _Culture and Anarchy_ (1869), _St. Paul and Protestantism_ (1870), _Friendship's Garland_ (1871), _Literature and Dogma_ (1873), _God and the Bible_ (1875), _Last Essays on Church and Religion_ (1877), _Mixed Essays_ (1879), _Irish Essays_ (1882), and _Discourses in America_ (1885). He also wrote some works on the state of education on the Continent. In 1883 he received a pension of £250. The rationalistic tendency of certain of his writings gave offence to many readers, and the sufficiency of his equipment in scholarship for dealing with some of the subjects which he handled was called in question; but he undoubtedly exercised a stimulating influence on his time; his writings are characterised by the finest culture, high purpose, sincerity, and a style of great distinction, and much of his poetry has an exquisite and subtle beauty, though here also it has been doubted whether high culture and wide knowledge of poetry did not sometimes take the place of the true poetic fire.  There is a bibliography of A.'s works by T.B. Smart (1892), and books upon him have been written by Prof. Saintsbury (1899), H. Paul (1902), and G.W.E. Russell (1904), also papers by Sir L. Stephen, F. Harrison, and others.   ARNOLD, THOMAS (1795-1842).--Historian, _s._ of an inland revenue officer in the Isle of Wight, was _ed._ at Winchester and Oxford, and after some years as a tutor, was, in 1828, appointed Head Master of Rugby. His learning, earnestness, and force of character enabled him not only to raise his own school to the front rank of public schools, but to exercise an unprecedented reforming influence on the whole educational system of the country. A liberal in politics, and a zealous church reformer, he was involved in many controversies, educational and religious. As a churchman he was a decided Erastian, and strongly opposed to the High Church party. In 1841 he was appointed Professor of Modern History at Oxford. His chief literary works are his unfinished _History of Rome_ (three vols. 1838-42), and his _Lectures on Modern History_. He _d._ suddenly of angina pectoris in the midst of his usefulness and growing influence. His life, by Dean Stanley (_q.v._), is one of the best works of its class in the language.   ASCHAM, ROGER (1515-1568).--Didactic writer and scholar, _s._ of John A., house-steward in the family of Lord Scrope, was _b._ at Kirby Wiske, Yorkshire, and _ed._ first by Sir Humphrey Wingfield, and then at St. John's Coll., Cambridge, where he devoted himself specially to the study of Greek, then newly revived, and of which, having taken a fellowship, he became a teacher. He was likewise noted for his skill in penmanship, music, and archery, the last of which is the subject of his first work, _Toxophilus_, _pub._ in 1545, and which, dedicated to Henry VIII., gained him the favour of the King, who bestowed a pension upon him. The objects of the book are twofold, to commend the practice of shooting with the long bow as a manly sport and an aid to national defence, and to set the example of a higher style of composition than had yet been attempted in English. Soon afterwards he was made university orator, and master of languages to the Lady (afterwards Queen) Elizabeth. He then went abroad in various positions of trust, returning on being appointed Latin Secretary to Edward VI. This office he likewise discharged to Mary and then to Elizabeth--a testimony to his tact and caution in these changeful times. His principal work, _The Schoolmaster_, a treatise on education, was printed by his widow in 1570. He also _pub._ a book on the political state of Germany.  Editions: of _Toxophilus_, Arber; _Schoolmaster_, Arber, also Mayer (1883); English works, Bennet (1767), with life by Dr. Johnson; whole works, Giles (1864-5).   ASGILL, JOHN (1659-1738).--Eccentric writer, student at the Middle Temple, 1686, and called to the Bar 1692. In 1699 he _pub._ in an unlucky hour a pamphlet to prove that death was not obligatory upon Christians, which, much to his surprise, aroused the public wrath and led to his expulsion from the Irish and English House of Commons successively. A. thereafter fell on evil days, and passed the rest of his life between the Fleet and the King's Bench, where, strange to say, his zeal as a pamphleteer continued unabated. He _d._ in 1738.   ASHMOLE, ELIAS (1617-1692).--Antiquary, was _ed._ at Lichfield, and became a solicitor in 1638. On the breaking out of the Civil War he sided with the royalists; went to Oxford and studied science, including astrology. The result of his studies in this region of mystery was his _Theatrum Chymicum Britannicum_, which gained him great repute and the friendship of John Selden. His last astrological treatise was _The Way to Bliss_, which dealt with the subject of \"the philosopher's stone.\" He also wrote various works on antiquarian subjects, and a _History of the Order of the Garter_. A. held various posts under government, and presented to the University of Oxford a valuable collection of curiosities now known as the Ashmolean Museum. He also bequeathed his library to the University. His wife was a _dau._ of Sir W. Dugdale, the antiquary.   ASSER (_d._ 909?).--Chronicler, a monk of St. David's, afterwards Bishop of Sherborne, was the friend, helper, and biographer of Ælfred. In addition to his life of Ælfred he wrote a chronicle of England from 849 to 887.   ATHERSTONE, EDWIN (1788-1872).--Poet and novelist. His works, which were planned on an imposing scale, attracted some temporary attention and applause, but are now forgotten. His chief poem, _The Fall of Nineveh_, consisting of thirty books, appeared at intervals from 1828 to 1868. He also produced two novels, _The Sea Kings in England_ and _The Handwriting on the Wall_.   ATTERBURY, FRANCIS (1662-1732).--Controversialist and preacher, was _b._ near Newport Pagnel, Bucks, and _ed._ at Westminster"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],["title","A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#5)"],["body","and Oxford. He became the leading protagonist on the High Church side in the ecclesiastical controversies of his time, and is believed to have been the chief author of the famous defence of Dr. Sacheverell in 1712. He also wrote most of Boyle's _Examination of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations on the Epistles of Phalaris_, and _pub._ sermons, which, with his letters to Swift, Pope, and other friends, constitute the foundation of his literary reputation. During the reign of the Tories he enjoyed much preferment, having been successively Canon of Exeter, Dean of Christ Church, Dean of Westminster, and Bishop of Rochester. His Jacobite principles, however, and his participation in various plots got him into trouble, and in 1722 he was confined in the Tower, deprived of all his offices, and ultimately banished. He _d._ at Paris, Feb. 15, 1732, and was buried privately in Westminster Abbey.   AUBREY, JOHN (1626-1697).--Antiquary, was a country gentleman who inherited estates in several counties in England, which he lost by litigation and otherwise. He devoted himself to the collection of antiquarian and miscellaneous observations, and gave assistance to Dugdale and Anthony à-Wood in their researches. His own investigations were extensive and minute, but their value is much diminished by his credulity, and want of capacity to weigh evidence. His only publication is his _Miscellanies_, a collection of popular superstitions, etc., but he left various collections, which were edited and _publ._ in the 19th century.   AUSTEN, JANE (1775-1817).--Novelist, _dau._ of a clergyman, was _b._ at the rectory of Steventon near Basingstoke. She received an education superior to that generally given to girls of her time, and took early to writing, her first tale being begun in 1798. Her life was a singularly uneventful one, and, but for a disappointment in love, tranquil and happy. In 1801 the family went to Bath, the scene of many episodes in her writings, and after the death of her _f._ in 1805 to Southampton, and later to Chawton, a village in Hants, where most of her novels were written. A tendency to consumption having manifested itself, she removed in May, 1817, to Winchester for the advantage of skilled medical attendance, but so rapid was the progress of her malady that she died there two months later. Of her six novels, four--_Sense and Sensibility_ (1811), _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813), _Mansfield Park_ (1814) and _Emma_ (1816)--were _pub._ anonymously during her life-time; and the others, _Northanger Abbey_--written in 1798--and _Persuasion_, finished in 1816, appeared a few months after her death, when the name of the authoress was divulged. Although her novels were from the first well received, it is only of comparatively late years that her genius has gained the wide appreciation which it deserves. Her strength lies in the delineation of character, especially of persons of her own sex, by a number of minute and delicate touches arising out of the most natural and everyday incidents in the life of the middle and upper classes, from which her subjects are generally taken. Her characters, though of quite ordinary types, are drawn with such wonderful firmness and precision, and with such significant detail as to retain their individuality absolutely intact through their entire development, and they are never coloured by her own personality. Her view of life is genial in the main, with a strong dash of gentle but keen satire: she appeals rarely and slightly to the deeper feelings; and the enforcement of the excellent lessons she teaches is left altogether to the story, without a word of formal moralising. Among her admirers was Sir W. Scott, who said, \"That young lady has a talent for describing the involvements of feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with;\" others were Macaulay (who thought that in the world there were no compositions which approached nearer to perfection), Coleridge, Southey, Sydney Smith, and E. FitzGerald.   AUSTIN, JOHN (1790-1859).--Jurist, served in the army in Sicily and Malta, but, selling his commission, studied law, and was called to the Bar 1818. He did not long continue to practise, but devoted himself to the study of law as a science, and became Professor of Jurisprudence in London University 1826-32. Thereafter he served on various Royal Commissions. By his works he exercised a profound influence on the views of jurisprudence held in England. These include _The Province of Jurisprudence Determined_ (1832), and his _Lectures on Jurisprudence_.   AYTON, SIR ROBERT (1570-1638).--Poet, _s._ of A. of Kinaldie in Fife. After _grad._ at St. Andrews, he studied law at Paris, became ambassador to the Emperor, and held other court offices. He appears to have been well-known to his literary contemporaries in England. He wrote poems in Latin, Greek, and English, and was one of the first Scotsmen to write in the last. His chief poem is _Diophantus and Charidora; Inconstancy Upbraided_ is perhaps the best of his short poems. He is credited with a little poem, _Old Long Syne_, which probably suggested Burns's famous _Auld Lang Syne_.   AYTOUN, WILLIAM EDMONSTONE (1813-1865).--Poet and humorist, _s._ of Roger A., a Writer to the Signet, was _b._ in Edinburgh and _ed._ there, and was brought up to the law, which, however, as he said, he \"followed but could never overtake.\" He became a contributor to _Blackwood's Magazine_ in 1836, and continued his connection with it until his death. In it appeared most of his humorous prose pieces, such as _The Glenmutchkin Railway_, _How I Became a Yeoman_, and _How I Stood for the Dreepdaily Burghs_, all full of vigorous fun. In the same pages began to appear his chief poetical work, the _Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers_, and a novel, partly autobiographical, _Norman Sinclair_. Other works were _The Bon Gaultier Ballads_, jointly with Theodore Martin, and _Firmilian, a Spasmodic Tragedy_, under the _nom-de-plume_ of T. Percy Jones, intended to satirise a group of poets and critics, including Gilfillan, Dobell, Bailey, and Alexander Smith. In 1845 A. obtained the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in Edinburgh University, which he filled with great success, raising the attendance from 30 to 150, and in 1852 he was appointed sheriff of Orkney and Shetland. He was married to a _dau._ of Professor Wilson (Christopher North).   BACON, FRANCIS, LORD VERULAM, AND VISCOUNT ST. ALBAN'S (1561-1626).--Philosopher and statesman, was the youngest _s._ of Sir Nicholas B., Lord Keeper, by his second wife, a _dau._ of Sir Anthony Cooke, whose sister married William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the great minister of Queen Elizabeth. He was _b._ at York House in the Strand on Jan. 22, 1561, and in his 13th year was sent with his elder brother Anthony to Trinity Coll., Cambridge. Here he first met the Queen, who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to call him \"the young Lord Keeper.\" Here also he became dissatisfied with the Aristotelian philosophy as being unfruitful and leading only to resultless disputation. In 1576 he entered Gray's Inn, and in the same year joined the embassy of Sir Amyas Paulet to France, where he remained until 1579. The death of his _f._ in that year, before he had completed an intended provision for him, gave an adverse turn to his fortunes, and rendered it necessary that he should decide upon a profession. He accordingly returned to Gray's Inn, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to induce Burghley to give him a post at court, and thus enable him to devote himself to a life of learning, he gave himself seriously to the study of law, and was called to the Bar in 1582. He did not, however, desert philosophy, and _pub._ a Latin tract, _Temporis Partus Maximus_ (the Greatest Birth of Time), the first rough draft of his own system. Two years later, in 1584, he entered the House of Commons as member for Melcombe, sitting subsequently for Taunton (1586), Liverpool (1589), Middlesex (1593), and Southampton (1597). In the Parliament of 1586 he took a prominent part in urging the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. About this time he seems again to have approached his powerful uncle, the result of which may possibly be traced in his rapid progress at the Bar, and in his receiving, in 1589, the reversion to the Clerkship of the Star Chamber, a valuable appointment, into the enjoyment of which, however, he did not enter until 1608. About 1591 he formed a friendship with the Earl of Essex, from whom he received many tokens of kindness ill requited. In 1593 the offices of Attorney-general, and subsequently of Solicitor-general became vacant, and Essex used his influence on B.'s behalf, but unsuccessfully, the former being given to Coke, the famous lawyer. These disappointments may have been owing to a speech made by B. on a question of subsidies. To console him for them Essex presented him with a property at Twickenham, which he subsequently sold for £1800, equivalent to a much larger sum now. In 1596 he was made a Queen's Counsel, but missed the appointment of Master of the Rolls, and in the next year (1597), he _pub._ the first edition of his _Essays_, ten in number, combined with _Sacred Meditations_ and the _Colours of Good and Evil_. By 1601 Essex had lost the Queen's favour, and had raised his rebellion, and B. was one of those appointed to investigate the charges against him, and examine witnesses, in connection with which he showed an ungrateful and indecent eagerness in pressing the case against his former friend and benefactor, who was executed on Feb. 25, 1601. This act B. endeavoured to justify in _A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons, etc., of ... the Earl of Essex, etc._ His circumstances had for some time been bad, and he had been arrested for debt: he had, however, received a gift of a fine of £1200 on one of Essex's accomplices. The accession of James VI. in 1603 gave a favourable turn to"]]]
