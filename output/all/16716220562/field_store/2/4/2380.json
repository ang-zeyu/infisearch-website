We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel the whole length of the river. He was a newspaper man. He started on his voyage of discovery one Easter in flood-time, and a month later the captain got bushed between the Darling and South Australian border. The waters went away before he could find the river again, and left his boat in a scrub. They had a cargo of rations, and the crew stuck to the craft while the tucker lasted; when it gave out they rolled up their swags and went to look for a station, but didn't find one. The captain would study his watch and the sun, rig up dials and make out courses, and follow them without success. They ran short of water, and didn't smell any for weeks; they suffered terrible privations, and lost three of their number, NOT including the newspaper liar. There are even dark hints considering the drawing of lots in connection with something too terrible to mention. They crossed a thirty-mile plain at last, and sighted a black gin. She led them to a boundary rider's hut, where they were taken in and provided with rations and rum.  Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the boat; but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen from the nearest waterhole deep enough to float her, so they left her there. She's there still, or else the man that told us about it is the greatest liar Out Back.      .   .   .   .   .  Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat, blunted a little at the ends and cut off about a foot below the water-line, and parallel to it, then you will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling mud-rooter. But the river boat is much stronger. The boat we were on was built and repaired above deck after the different ideas of many bush carpenters, of whom the last seemed by his work to have regarded the original plan with a contempt only equalled by his disgust at the work of the last carpenter but one. The wheel was boxed in, mostly with round sapling-sticks fastened to the frame with bunches of nails and spikes of all shapes and sizes, most of them bent. The general result was decidedly picturesque in its irregularity, but dangerous to the mental welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend the design; for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the opportunity to work in a little abstract idea of his own.  The way they “dock” a Darling River boat is beautiful for its simplicity. They choose a place where there are two stout trees about the boat's length apart, and standing on a line parallel to the river. They fix pulley-blocks to the trees, lay sliding planks down into the water, fasten a rope to one end of the steamer, and take the other end through the block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second steamer; then they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the block on the second tree, and aboard a third boat. At a given signal one boat leaves for Wentworth, and the other starts for the Queensland border. The consequence is that craft number one climbs the bank amid the cheers of the local loafers, who congregate and watch the proceedings with great interest and approval. The crew pitch tents, and set to work on the hull, which looks like a big, rough shallow box.      .   .   .   .   .  We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat called the 'Mud Turtle'--at least, that's what WE called her. She might reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago. She didn't seem particular where she went, or whether she started again or stopped for good after getting stuck. Her machinery sounded like a chapter of accidents and was always out of order, but she got along all the same, provided the steersman kept her off the bank.  Her skipper was a young man, who looked more like a drover than a sailor, and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than to any other body we know of, except that they looked a little more independent. They seemed clannish, too, with an unemployed or free-labour sort of isolation. We have an idea that they regarded our personal appearance with contempt.      .   .   .   .   .  Above Louth we picked up a “whaler”, who came aboard for the sake of society and tobacco. Not that he hoped to shorten his journey; he had no destination. He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies, and gave us a few ornamental facts. One of them took our fancy, and impressed us--with its beautiful simplicity, I suppose. He said: “Some miles above where the Darlin' and the Warrygo runs inter each other, there's a billygong runnin' right across between the two rivers and makin' a sort of tryhangular hyland; 'n' I can tel'yer a funny thing about it.” Here he paused to light his pipe. “Now,” he continued, impressively, jerking the match overboard, “when the Darlin's up, and the Warrygo's LOW, the billygong runs from the Darlin' into the WARRYGO; AND, when the Warrygo's up 'n' the Darlin's down, the waters runs FROM the Warrygo 'n' inter the Darlin'.”  What could be more simple?  The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from a shed which was cutting out; and first it was necessary to tie up in the river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that the boat might safely negotiate the shallow waters. A local fisherman, who volunteered to act as pilot, was taken aboard, and after he was outside about a pint of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence in his ability to take us to hell, or anywhere else--at least, he said so. A man was sent ashore with blankets and tucker to mind the wool, and we crossed the river, butted into the anabranch, and started out back. Only the Lord and the pilot know how we got there. We travelled over the bush, through its branches sometimes, and sometimes through grass and mud, and every now and then we struck something that felt and sounded like a collision. The boat slid down one hill, and “fetched” a stump at the bottom with a force that made every mother's son bite his tongue or break a tooth.  The shearers came aboard next morning, with their swags and two cartloads of boiled mutton, bread, “brownie”, and tea and sugar. They numbered about fifty, including the rouseabouts. This load of sin sank the steamer deeper into the mud; but the passengers crowded over to port, by request of the captain, and the crew poked the bank away with long poles. When we began to move the shearers gave a howl like the yell of a legion of lost souls escaping from down below. They gave three cheers for the rouseabouts' cook, who stayed behind; then they cursed the station with a mighty curse. They cleared a space on deck, had a jig, and afterwards a fight between the shearers' cook and his assistant. They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the boat swung into that grand old gutter, and in the evening they had a general all-round time. We got back, and the crew had to reload the wool without assistance, for it bore the accursed brand of a “freedom-of-contract”  shed.  We slept, or tried to sleep, that night on the ridge of two wool bales laid with the narrow sides up, having first been obliged to get ashore and fight six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there. The live cinders from the firebox went up the chimney all night, and fell in showers on deck. Every now and again a spark would burn through the “Wagga rug” of a sleeping shearer, and he'd wake suddenly and get up and curse. It was no use shifting round, for the wind was all ways, and the boat steered north, south, east, and west to humour the river. Occasionally a low branch would root three or four passengers off their wool bales, and they'd get up and curse in chorus. The boat started two snags; and towards daylight struck a stump. The accent was on the stump. A wool bale went overboard, and took a swag and a dog with it; then the owner of the swag and dog and the crew of the boat had a swearing match between them. The swagman won.  About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs, extricated one leg from between the wool bales, and found that the steamer was just crayfishing away from a mud island, where she had tied up for more wool. Some of the chaps had been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee. Shortly after the boat had settled down to work again an incident came along. A rouseabout rose late, and, while the others were at breakfast, got an idea into his head that a good “sloosh” would freshen him up; so he mooched round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it. He carried the bucket aft of the wheel. The boat was butting up stream for all she was worth, and the stream was running the other way, of course, and about a hundred times as fast as a train. The jackeroo gave the line a turn round his wrist; before anyone could see him in time to suppress him, he lifted the bucket, swung it to and fro, and dropped it cleverly into the water.  This delayed us for nearly an hour. A couple of men jumped into the row boat immediately and cast her adrift. They picked up the jackeroo about a mile down the river, clinging to a snag, and when we hauled him aboard he looked like something the cat had dragged in, only bigger. We revived him with rum and got him on his feet; and then, when the captain and crew had done cursing him, he rubbed his head, went forward, and had a look at the paddle; then he rubbed his head again, thought, and remarked to his mates:  “Wasn't it lucky I didn't dip that bucket FOR'ARD the wheel?”  This remark struck us forcibly. We agreed that it was lucky--for him; but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world, which, he explained, was over-populated with fools already.  Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied up to a tree in the wilderness. There was no sign of a man to be seen, nor any sign, except the barge, that a human being had ever been "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13135"],["title","Pardners (#0)"],["body","by  REX E.

He meant pardnerships.  The same works ain't got capacity for both, no more'n you can build a split-second stop-watch in a stone quarry.  No, sir! A true pardnership is the sanctifiedest relation that grows, is, and has its beans, while any two folks of opposite sect can marry and peg the game out some way.  Of course, all pardnerships ain't divine.  To every one that's heaven borned there's a thousand made in ----. There goes them cussed dogs again!\"  He dove abruptly at the tent flap, disappearing like a palmed coin, while our canvas structure reeled drunkenly at his impact.  The sounds of strife without rose shrilly into blended agony, and the yelps of Keno melted away down the gulch in a rapid and rabid diminuendo.  Inasmuch as I had just packed out from camp in a loose pair of rubber boots, and was nursing two gall blisters, I did not feel called upon to emulate this energy of arbitration, particularly in bare feet.  \"That black malamoot is a walking delegate for strife,\" he remarked, returning.  \"Sometime I'll lose my temper--and that's the kind of pardners me and Justus Morrow was.\"  Never more do I interrupt the allegory of my mate, no matter how startling its structure.  He adventures orally when and in the manner the spirit calls, without rote, form, or tone production.  Therefore I kicked my blistered heels in the air and grunted aimless encouragement.  \"I was prospectin' a claim on Caribou Creek, and had her punched as full of holes as a sponge cake, when the necessity of a change appealed to me.  I was out of everything more nourishing than hope and one slab of pay-streaked bacon, when two tenderfeet 'mushed' up the gulch, and invited themselves into my cabin to watch me pan. It's the simplest thing known to science to salt a tenderfoot, so I didn't have no trouble in selling out for three thousand dollars.  \"You see, they couldn't kick, 'cause some of us 'old timers' was bound to get their money anyhow--just a question of time; and their inexperience was cheap at the price.  Also, they was real nice boys, and I hated to see 'em fall amongst them crooks at Dawson.  It was a short-horned triumph, though.  Like the Dead Sea biscuits of Scripture, it turned to ashes in my mouth.  It wasn't three days later that they struck it; right in my last shaft, within a foot of where I quit diggin'.  They rocked out fifty ounces first day.  When the news filtered to me, of course, I never made no holler.  I couldn't--that is, honestly--but I bought a six hundred dollar grub stake, loaded it aboard a dory, and--having instructed the trader regarding the disposition of my mortal, drunken remains, I fanned through that camp like a prairie fire shot in the sirloin with a hot wind.  \"Of course, it wasn't such a big spree; nothing gaudy or Swedelike; but them that should know, claimed it was a model of refinement. Yes, I have got many encomiums on its general proportions and artistic finish.  One hundred dollars an hour for twenty-four hours, all in red licker, confined to and in me and my choicest sympathizers.  I reckon all our booze combined would have made a fair sluice-head.  Anyhow, I woke up considerable farther down the dim vistas of time and about the same distance down the Yukon, in the bottom of my dory, seekin' new fields at six miles an hour.  The trader had follered my last will and testament scrupulous, even to coverin' up my legs.  \"That's how I drifted into Rampart City, and Justus Morrow.  \"This here town was the same as any new camp; a mile long and eighteen inches wide, consisting of saloons, dance-halls, saloons, trading-posts, saloons, places to get licker, and saloons.  Might not have been so many dancehalls and trading-posts as I've mentioned, and a few more saloons.  \"I dropped into a joint called The Reception, and who'd I see playing 'bank' but 'Single Out' Wilmer, the worst gambler on the river. Mounted police had him on the woodpile in Dawson, then tied a can on him.  At the same table was a nice, tender Philadelphia squab, 'bout fryin' size, and while I was watching, Wilmer pulls down a bet belonging to it.  That's an old game.  \"'Pardon me,' says the broiler; 'you have my checks.'  \"'What?' growls 'Single Out;' 'I knowed this game before you quit nursin', Bright Eyes.  I can protect my own bets.'  \"'That's right,' chimes the dealer, who I seen was 'Curly' Budd, Wilmer's pardner.  \"'Lord!' thinks I, 'there's a pair to draw to.'  \"'Do you really think you had ought to play this?  It's a man's game,' says Wilmer nasty.  \"I expected to see the youngster dog it.  Nothin' of the kind.  \"'That's my bet!' he says again, and I noticed something dry in his voice, like the rustle of silk.  \"Single Out just looks black and snarls at the dealer.  \"'Turn the cards!'  \"'Oh, very well,' says the chechako, talking like a little girl.  \"Somebody snickered and, thinks I 'there's sprightly doin's hereabouts.  I'll tarry a while and see 'em singe the fowl.  I like the smell of burning pin feathers; it clears my head.'  \"Over in the far corner was another animal in knee panties, riggin' up one of these flash-light, snappy-shot, photograft layouts.  I found afterwards that he done it for a living; didn't work none, just strayed around as co-respondent for an English newspaper syndicate, taking pictures and writing story things.  I didn't pay much attention to him hiding under his black cloth, 'cause the faro-table was full of bets, and it's hard to follow the play.  Well, bye-and-bye Wilmer shifted another stack belonging to the Easterner.  \"The lad never begged his pardon nor nothin'.  His fist just shot out and landed on the nigh corner of Wilmer's jaw, clean and fair, and 'Single Out' done as pretty a headspin as I ever see--considering that it was executed in a cuspidore.  'Twas my first insight into the amenities of football.  I'd like to see a whole game of it.  They say it lasts an hour and a half.  Of all the cordial, why-how-do-you-do mule kicks handed down in rhyme and story, that wallop was the adopted daddy.  \"When he struck, I took the end of the bar like a steeplechaser, for I seen 'Curly' grab at the drawer, and I have aversions to witnessing gun plays from the front end.  The tenderfoot riz up in his chair, and snatchin' a stack of reds in his off mit, dashed 'em into 'Curly's' face just as he pulled trigger.  It spoiled his aim, and the boy was on to him like a mountain lion, follerin' over the table, along the line of least resistance.  \"It was like takin' a candy sucker from a baby.  'Curly' let go of that 'six' like he was plumb tired of it, and the kid welted him over the ear just oncet.  Then he turned on the room; and right there my heart went out to him.  He took in the line up at a sweep of his lamps:  \"'Any of you gentlemen got ideas on the subject?' he says, and his eyes danced like waves in the sunshine.  \"It was all that finished and genteel that I speaks up without thinkin', 'You for me pardner!'  \"Just as I said it, there come a swish and flash as if a kag of black powder had changed its state of bein'.  I s'pose everybody yelled and dodged except the picture man.  He says, 'Thank you, gents; very pretty tableau.'  \"It was the first flash-light I ever see, and all I recall now is a panorama of starin' eyeballs and gaping mouths.  When it seen it wasn't torpedoed, the population begin crawlin' out from under chairs and tables.  Men hopped out like toads in a rain.  \"I crossed the boy's trail later that evening; found him watchin' a dance at the Gold Belt.  The photografter was there, too, and when he'd got his dog-house fixed, he says:  \"'Everybody take pardners, and whoop her up.  I want this picture for the _Weekly_.  Get busy, you, there!\"  We all joined in to help things; the orchestra hit the rough spots, and we went highfalutin' down the centre, to show the English race how our joy pained us, and that life in the Klondyke had the Newport whirl, looking like society in a Siwash village.  He got another good picture.  \"Inside of a week, Morrow and I had joined up.  We leased a claim and had our cabin done, waiting for snow to fall so's to sled our grub out to the creek.  He took to me like I did to him, and he was an educated lad, too.  Somehow, though, it hadn't gone to his head, leaving his hands useless, like knowledge usually does.  \"One day, just before the last boat pulled down river, Mr. Struthers, the picture man, come to us--R. Alonzo Struthers, of London and 'Frisco, he was--and showin' us a picture, he says:  \"'Ain't that great?  Sunday supplements!  Full page!  Big display! eh?'  \"It sure was.  'Bout 9x9, and showing every detail of the Reception saloon.  There was 'Single Out' analyzing the cuspidore and 'Curly' dozin', as contorted and well-done as a pretzel.  There was the crowd hiding in the corners, and behind the faro-table stood the kid, one hand among the scattered chips and cards, the other dominating the layout with 'Curley's' 'six.'  It couldn't have looked more natural if we'd posed for it.  It was a bully likeness, I thought, too, till I seen myself glaring over the bar.  All that showed of William P. Joyce, bachelor of some arts and plenty of science, late of Dawson, was the white of his eyes.  And talkin' of white--say, I looked like I had washing hung out.  Seemed like the draught had riz my hair up, too.  \"'Nothing like it ever seen,' continues Struthers.  'I'll call it 'The Winning Card,' or 'At Bay,' or"]]]
