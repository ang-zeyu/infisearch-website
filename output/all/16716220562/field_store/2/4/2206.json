I enter the cottage of want and woe--   The candle is dim and the fire burns low;   But the sleepers smile in a happy dream   As I scatter my gifts by the moon's pale beam.    \"There's never a home so low, no doubt.   But I in my flight can find it out;   Not a hut so hidden but I can see   The shadow cast by the lone roof-tree!   There's never a home so proud and high   That I am constrained to pass it by,   Nor a heart so happy it may not be   Happier still when blessed by me!    \"What is my name? Ah, who can tell,   Though in every land 'tis a magic spell?   Men call me that, and they call me this;   Yet the different names are the same, I wish!   Gift-bearer to all the world am I,   Joy-giver, light-bringer, where'er I fly;   But the name I bear in the courts above,   My truest and holiest name, is--LOVE!\"  JULIA C.R.

A white wig and beard, fur coat and gloves are     worn, and sleigh-bells are sounded before Father Christmas     appears on the platform.)    Here I am again. The close of the year   Brings Old Father Christmas with his good cheer   I'm cheery myself, and cheery I make   All folks who follow advice for my sake.   My advice is the same to all my friends:   Give and forgive, and quickly make amends   For what you do wrong. Let love be the rule.   Christians, be true at the season of Yule.   Old Father Christmas every one welcomes;   I bring peace and happiness to all homes.   Away with the bad. Have nothing but good.   Do what I tell you. If only you would,   You'd all live at one in true brotherhood.   I always brighten up all hearts. The spell   Of Christmas can all gloomy thoughts dispel.   My friends, right pleased am I to see you here.   How are you all? Pray come again next year.   I hope you've liked the fun we've had to-night;   If so, then now applaud with all your might.  J.A. ATKINSON.          *       *       *       *       *  =Mr. St. Nicholas.=  By ALICE M. KELLOGG.      (The characters are Old-fashioned Santa Claus, dressed in the     traditional costume of fur, white beard, and a Christmas pack;     Mr. St. Nicholas, in evening dress with silk hat; Dora, Katie,     Maggie, and little Bess; Harry, Charlie, Tom, and John in     ordinary school clothes.      The scene opens with a large fireplace arranged at the center     of the platform, a dark curtain drawn before the opening     to conceal Santa Claus. The accompaniment to \"Nancy Lee\"     is heard, and the eight children march in, carrying their     stockings.)    Oh, Christmas time has come again,     Tra la la la, tra la la la;   We welcome it with glad refrain,     Tra la la la la la.    Of all the happy holidays this year   There's none so joyous, none so dear,   Then sing we all our song of festive glee,   Of Santa Claus and Christmas tree.  _Chorus_.--Oh, ring the bells, the merry Christmas bells, Their music all our pleasure tells. _(Repeat, singing tra la la whenever necessary to give the rhythm. They pause in groups in center, right, and left; some sit, others stand, and change their positions during the dialogue)_  _Harry_: Oh dear, the same old thing again this year, I suppose! \"Hang up the baby's stocking, be sure you don't forget.\"  _Charlie_: _This_ baby's stocking is the biggest bicycle hose I could buy. (_Pins it at one side of the chimney_.) I don't think old Santa could miss it if he tried.  _Dora_: I made mine to suit the occasion, for I hope Santa Claus will fit a zither into it. (_Displays a large, fantastically shaped stocking of striking color, and fastens it beside Charlie's_.)  _Harry_: You ought to take a prize, Dora, for designing the most--ahem!--unexpected-looking stocking. Generous sized, too! Here goes my contribution to the chimney. (_Hangs up a sock_.) It's big enough to hold a coin of gold that will buy me a new bicycle. I don't care for any knick-knacks.  _Katie_: I must confess that I'm rather tired of this old custom of hanging up our stockings on Christmas eve and crawling out of bed in the cold dawn to see what is in them. I wish some one would invent a new way.  _Maggie_: Just what I thought, Katie, last winter, though I never spoke of it. But if you've hung your stocking up, I must have mine there too. (_Goes to chimney_.)  _John_: Well, I refuse to fall in line this year. I'm tired of the whole plan. It seems absurd for an old chap to come tumbling down the fireplace and load up our stockings.  _Tom_: I agree with you, John! What we want is a new-fashioned Christmas. A real, up-to-date Santa Claus, and no more of this children's nonsense.  _Bess_: Not have Santa Claus any more? Isn't he coming to-night? (_Cries_.)  _John_: Oh yes, he'll remember you if you're a good little girl and stop crying. Dora, help Bess to fasten up her stocking.  (_After the stocking is fixed, Bess faces the audience and recites_.)    _Bess_:      I do hope dear old Santa                  Will come this way to-night,                And come here to my stocking,                  To fill it nice and tight.                 I'd like to watch and see him,                  But I know I must wait                Till shines the Christmas sunshine--                  I hope he won't be late.  _Tom_: Let Bess have her old-fashioned Santa Claus, but the rest of us vote for something different.  _Harry_: I used to think Santa a pretty jolly old duffer, who made lots of sport for the infants, but I'm ready for a change myself.  _Dora_: Don't count me in to help out your majority; Santa Claus seems to me the kindly spirit of Christmas appearing mysteriously to give us greater pleasure.  _Katie_: Well, I'll side with the boys this time and see if there is any improvement in holiday matters.  _Charlie_: You'll think me a baby to stick to the old style. I won't venture an opinion at all.  _Tom_: Then we are agreed that of Santa Claus we have no need.  _John_:    } _Kate_:    } Tis what we all concede. _Harry_:   } _Maggie_:  }  _(All sing to the tune_ of \"_Maryland, My Maryland_.\")    Old Santa Claus is such a bore,   Of him we've had too much and more;   Now what we want is something new,   But what is there for us to do?   A new St. Nick would be the thing,   Who would our Christmas presents bring.  (_Electric bell sounds, the door opens, and Mr. St. Nicholas comes on the stage. He bows and takes off his hat_.)  _Mr. St. N_.: Good evening, young people! I see you are at your old-time tricks of hanging up your stockings. This won't do. Don't you know it's gone out of fashion? (_Goes toward fireplace; the boys rush to protect their property_.)  _John_: Who are you, sir? And how dare you interfere with our fun?  _Mr. St. N_.: I am the new, up-to-the-times Santa Claus. My proper name is Mr. St. Nicholas. I am on my rounds to take the names of all the young people who deserve a remembrance at Christmas time. I haven't a moment to lose. My telephones are overburdened with messages, my men are distracted with the work to be done between now and daylight. _(Pulls out a book and pencil and prepares to write while he addresses Tom and speaks rapidly without waiting for a reply_.) Your name, young man? Your age, birthplace, parents' names? Residence? Attendant at what school? What specific tastes? List of last year's presents. Make haste, time is money.  _Katie_: But Santa--I mean Mr. St. Nicholas--here are our stockings.  _Mr. St. N_.: Christmas stockings! trash and nonsense. They belong to the dark ages.  _Harry_: Pray, how do you bestow your gifts?  _Mr. St. N_.: By district messenger service, of course! Next boy _(to Charlie_), give me your name, age, birthplace, parents' names, residence, school, specific tastes, last year's presents.  _Charlie_: How did you come here, Mr. St. Nicholas? I heard no sleigh-bells at the door.  _Mr. St. N. (scornfully)_: More nonsense to explain. I came down from the north pole in an air-ship of the latest pattern. Come, now, here are these girls waiting to be classified. _(To Dora.)_ Name, age--  _Dora_: I won't be put in statistics, even if it is Christmas and you are the patron saint.  _Charlie_: Nor I. I didn't vote for any improvements. Take them away.  _John:_ You seem a trifle ahead of the age, Mr. St. Nicholas, or else we made a great mistake in being discontented with our old-fashioned Christmas.  _Tom_: Allow me to call down your air-ship.  _(Mr. St. Nicholas is ushered to the door. The others turn back at the sound of sleigh-bells. Santa Claus appears at the fireplace_.)  _Children (greeting him with enthusiasm_): Jolly _old_ Saint Nicholas!  _Santa Claus_: Oh! ho! ha! ha! Are you really glad to see such an old-fashioned specimen as I am?  _John_: Indeed we are! We have just shown your usurper the door.  _Bess_ (_clasping S.C.'s hand_): You are the real Santa Claus.  _Santa Claus_: Yes, I am the real Santa Claus, and I cannot get to work until you children are fast asleep. So scurry away as fast as you can, and a merry, merry Christmas when you awake!  _Children_ (_singing to the tune of \"Nancy Lee,\" end at the end leaving the stage_):    Oh! Christmas time has come again,         Tra la la la, tra la la la.   We welcome it with glad refrain,         Tra la la la la la.   Of all the happy holidays this year,   There's none so joyous, none so dear,   Then sing we all our song of festive glee,   Of Santa Claus and Christmas tree.  _Chorus_.--O ring the bells, the merry Christmas bells, Their music all out pleasure tells.

POWERS.      (DIRECTIONS.--This exercise may be given by six little girls.     The platform may be decorated with evergreen trees or boughs,     and flags should be used freely. The American girl should be     dressed in an American flag and wear a cap of red, white, and     blue. The costumes of the others may be as follows:      The Eskimo girl should procure a boy's fur coat, or wrap a fur     rug about her and wear a fur cap or hood and fur mittens.      The Indian girl can throw about her a gay-colored blanket,     and wear strings of beads about her neck, arms, and head. Her     straight dark hair should be parted in the middle, plaited     in two braids in the back, and decorated with short pieces of     bright ribbons. Moccasins and dark brown stockings may be worn     on the feet. Bracelets, earrings, chains, beads, quills, and     brooches may be used as ornaments. The hands, arms, and face     should be stained. To color the skin get a stick of Hess     Grease Paint No. 17. Rub a little vaseline into the skin to     be tinted.

The Chinese girl should be dressed brightly with large,     square, loose hanging sleeves, a broad sash tied on one side,     her hair brushed flat, coiled in the back, with haircomb and     pins thrust into the coil.

She should be very dark-complexioned      The American girl enters, takes her seat in the center of the     platform, saying:)  _American girl_:      And this again is Christmas day;       My invitations all     Have gladly been accepted;       Let us see who first will call.      (Eskimo girl enters, bows, comes forward with a fur bag filled     with presents, which she passes to the American girl as she     mentions them.)  _Eskimo girl_:      I'm a little Eskimo girl,       I live in the land of ice,     We never saw a Christmas tree       Nor fruits and candies nice;     But we run races o'er the snow,       Beneath the big, bright moon,     And from this far away ice-land,       I've brought you a nice bone spoon.     My father hunts all through the day       For reindeer, seal, and bear,     And sends away in ships so strong       These furs so rich and rare,     And fish, and birds, and whales, you know,       I've seen them many a time,     And here's a pretty fur for you       That came from the arctic clime.      (Eskimo girl offers presents and steps to one side. American     girl turns and places presents on the boughs beside her. Enter     Indian girl.)  _Indian girl_:      I'm a little Indian girl,       I live in the far Northwest,     In the land of the Dakotas,       In the land I love the best.     I've brought a nice bead-basket,       I made it all. You see      I know about your Christmas       A happy day to thee.     And here's an arrow-head for you,       And a piece of pottery queer,     And here are herbs for medicine good,       To make you strong, my dear.      We children shoot and fish and hunt       Just as our fathers do,     The whole wide forest is our home:       It feeds and clothes us, too.      (Steps aside. Enter Chinese girl.)  _Chinese girl_:      I'm a little Chinese girl,       They say I've almond eyes,     I live in a boat, on a river we float,       And often eat rice and rat pies.      And here is a bamboo basket,       Filled with choicest tea,     I picked and dried it all myself       It comes from Ken See Lee.   (_Bows low_.)      With us we have no Christmas,       No presents nor a tree;     But there in the boat, I made this toy,       This, too, comes from Ken See Lee.      (Chinese girl bows low and takes a seat on low stool in front     of American girl. Enter African girl.)  _African girl_:      I'm a dark little African girl,       I live in a forest land,     With kinky curls and jet black eyes,       I watch the elephant band.      My father hunts these animals,       From one of them I bring     An elephant's tusk to you, my friend,       'Twill make you a pretty ring.      And here is ebony wood for you,       A cocoanut from the palm,     And dates to eat, so very sweet,       All from our African farm.      (Offers presents, which American girl hangs on the boughs.     African girl steps to her left. Enter Arabian girl.)  _Arabian girl_:      I'm a little Arabian girl,       I live in a desert land,     In tents on the plain so hot and dry,       And I play on the burning sand;      Here is a pretty pearl I've brought,       And an ostrich's egg so rare;     An Arab pony you should have       And a cloak of camel's hair.      I never hear about Christmas,       And don't know what you mean,     But hope you will accept these gifts,       And this ostrich feather green.      (Offers gifts. American girl accepts them, rises, places them     on tree; then turns and repeats.)  _American girl_:      And I'm a happy American girl,       How thankful I should be,     That Christmas is so bright a day       And means so much to me.      I thank you, friends, for all these gifts,       Of presents I've my share;     And _you_ show _your_ good-will to men       With generous gifts so rare.      (All stand in line and repeat together)      _All_: Our countries all are glorious lands,       So great, so rich, so rare;     Our people all are glorious bands;       So true, so good, so fair.      Whatever country we are from,       Whatever life we lead,     We'll do our best; be good and true.       And do some noble deed.          *       *       *       *       *  =A Christmas Reunion.=  By M.D. STERLING.      (CHARACTERS REPRESENTED. _Father Christmas_, a large boy     dressed in long belted robe; he carries a staff, and wears     a white wig and beard. _Mother Goose_, a tall girl wearing     a peaked soft hat tied over an old lady's frilled cap; also     neck-kerchief and apron, spectacles on nose, and a broom of     twigs, such as street-cleaners use, complete her costume.     _Mother Goose's_ son _Jack_ and her _Children_ may be costumed     according to the pictures in any good illustrated copy of     \"Mother Goose.\" The _Children of the Nations_ are sufficiently     represented by boys and girls each carrying one of the flags     of all nations, but elaborate costumes in keeping with the     national character may be used, if desired. _Thanksgiving_     and _Happy New Year_, large girls in white Grecian dresses,     flowing sleeves; their children, _Peace_ and _Plenty_, _Good     Resolutions_ and _Hope_ are represented by smaller girls     in white, _Peace_ carrying an olive branch. _Plenty_ a     cornucopia, _Good Resolutions_ a diary and pen, and _Hope_     wearing a wreath of golden stars and carrying a gilt anchor     (cut from heavy cardboard); _Santa Claus_, a stout, roly-poly     boy, if possible, wearing a long overcoat flaked with cotton     (to represent snow) and a round fur cap and mittens; an empty     pack should hang carelessly from one shoulder.)      (Enter _Father Christmas_ and _Mother Goose_, arm in arm.     While conversing, they walk up and down the platform. At the     end of Mother Goose's second speech, they seat themselves     in two large arm-chairs, which should be ready in middle of     platform.)    _Mother Goose_:      Well, well, Father Christmas, I'll do as you say,     And put off my trip for the frolic to-day.     Your thought of a Christmas reunion is fine     For all of our relatives--yours, sir, and mine;--     So, though greatly disposed at this season to wander     Afloat in the air on my very fine gander,     Instead of such exercise, wholesome and hearty,     I've come with great pleasure to your Christmas party.    _Father Christmas (bowing):_      Thanks, thanks, Mother Goose, for the honor you pay     To me your old friend now this many a day;     Tho' we may not, of course, on all questions agree,     We're alike in our love for the children, you see:     To give them delight is our greatest of pleasures,     And freely we share with them best of our treasures;     Our energies each of us constantly bends     To keep our loved title \"The Children's Two Friends.\"    _Mother Goose_:      Ah, yes, Father Christmas, my jingles and rhymes,     The boys and girls know in far separate climes,     And sometimes I think that your son Santa Claus     Earns me more than my share of the children's applause;     For wherever he goes with his wonderful pack     Santa always has some of my books on his back;     When from Christmas-eve dreams children's eyelids unloose     Oft they find in their stockings my book, \"Mother Goose.\"    _Father Christmas_:      Tis true, my dear madam, that I and my son     Respect most profoundly the work you have done.     The boys from our store-rooms in Christmas-tree Land,     Get the bonbons we make on the Sugar-loaf Strand;     The children enjoy them,--I cannot deny it,--     But still need your writings as part of their diet;     Your rhymes, wise and witty, their minds will retain     When their toys and their candy are done,--that is plain.      (Enter Jack, the son of Mother Goose. He carries a large     golden egg.)  _Jack_: Oh, there you are,"]]]
