All the malignity and cruelty that could be expressed in a human face I thought I saw expressed in his. And yet he wore his old fascinating smile; he never lost his seeming self-possession.  \"I must deny Mr. Blake's statement,\" he said; \"and, further, I would defy him to find or produce such a code of questions as he mentions.\"  I immediately left the room, and soon afterwards returned with a book by a renowned thought-reader, wherein he explained what, to so many, has appeared marvellous. I pointed out how, according to his system, by asking a question, the first word of which should begin with a certain letter, a particular thing should be indicated, and all that would be needed was that the performers should be perfectly conversant with the system.  The company quickly saw the truth of what I was saying, and for the time, at any rate, Mr. Voltaire's marvellous knowledge was held at a discount. \"But does Mr. Blake mean to insinuate that Mr. Kaffar and myself have learnt such a code as this?\" said Voltaire at length.  \"I insinuate nothing,\" I replied. \"I am simply showing how your performance can be done by those possessing no knowledge of the occult sciences.\"  \"But does Mr. Blake decline to believe that we know nothing of the mysterious--that we have not dived into subjects of which the ordinary mind can know nothing?\" said Kaffar.  \"Pardon me,\" I replied, \"but I decline to answer. I have not volunteered any opinion either as to Mr. Voltaire's story or your performance. I was asked my opinion, and I gave it.\"  I watched Mr. Voltaire's face as I spoke. He seemed to be pondering some matter in his mind, and appeared irresolute as to what action he should take. At length, a strange light shot from his eyes, and he raised his head and spoke.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"evidently Mr. Blake, with his hard English common-sense, has raised some amount of doubt in your minds as to the validity of my story and of our performance. I am sure you will allow me to vindicate and prove any assertion I have made. If I have claimed a knowledge of the mysterious, I have not done so without reason.\"  \"We believe that is true,\" said Miss Staggles; \"we believe you are a wonderful man.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Voltaire. \"I am sure I have Miss Staggles' sympathies, but will some one assist me in what I am about to do? I will allow no possibility of a _system_ in this, and consequently I shall be glad if any gentleman will help me in the manifestation of the hidden powers of the human mind. Perhaps\"--turning, I thought, eagerly to me--\"Mr. Blake will be the one?\"  \"No,\" I said; \"I prefer to be a spectator.\"  I could no longer mistake the hate that flashed from his eyes; but he said nothing, and waited quietly for a volunteer. No one was forthcoming. At length Tom Temple said--  \"Would one of the servants do, Voltaire?\"  \"I would rather have a visitor,\" said Voltaire, \"and for two reasons: first, you could not then have any reason for suspecting a collusion; and, second, the ordinary English servant is extremely unsusceptible to the play of higher powers. If, however, none of you will volunteer, I can see no other alternative.\"  Accordingly, a man about my own age was brought in, and introduced as Simon Slowden. I saw that he was no ordinary character as soon as he entered, and was by no means one who could be easily imposed upon. I afterwards found that Simon had spent his boyhood in London, had when a youth joined a travelling circus, and tramped the country for a few years. He had also travelled with several \"shows,\" two or three travelling theatres, and had finally settled down with a lame leg at Temple Hall, where he made himself generally useful.  His dialect was a mixture of the Cockney and a dozen others equally bad, until it was almost impossible to tell from that source the part of the country from which he hailed. He was, however, a good-hearted fellow, and for a wonder, considering his history, as honest as the day.  \"Now, Simon,\" said Tom Temple, \"this gentleman is a scientist and wants to show some experiments, and he can't get any one to assist him, so I thought I'd ask you.\"  \"Well,\" said Simon, \"I don't know as I think mich on these science gents. They're allays a-bringin' in some new-fangled thing or other, but generally there's nowt in 'em. Still, to 'blige the company, I'll do owt raisonable. I'm tough has a crocodile's tongue, and can stand a goodish bit o' jingo and nonsense. Here goes, yer honour.\" Voltaire eyed him doubtfully, and Simon coolly returned the stare.  \"You are not a-gwine to waccinate me, be 'ee?\" said Simon at length.  \"No--why?\"  \"'Cause I can't stand that, tough as I be. I lived wi' a doctor once, and says he to me, 'Simon, I want to speriment on ye,' says he. 'I'm tough 'nough,' says I. 'I want to waccinate you 'gainst cholera, hoopin' cough, and small-pox,' says he. 'What's that? give 'em to me?' says I. 'No,' says he, 'but to prevent you from a hevin' 'em.' 'That's yer sorts,' says I. Well, gentlemen, he waccinated me, and I said to un, 'Never no more, yer honour.'\"  \"Why?\" asked I.  \"'Cause I'd rather hev cholera, hoopin' cough, and small-pox all together than be waccinated. Jes like women, you never know where they'll break out.\"  \"Will you kindly sit down,\" said Voltaire, \"while I go to my room for a book?\"  While he was gone I went to Simon, and spoke to him, and that gentleman got very communicative.  \"I'm not overmich in love wi' that chap,\" he says; \"and sure's I'm a right-down Cockney, he hates you like pizen. Give 'im a wide berth, yer honour, and doan't hev nothin' to do wi' 'im.\"  \"Oh,\" I replied, \"he can't hurt me.\"  \"Don't know, yer honour. You and he's got your peepers fixed in the same place, and scuse me; but if you give 'im a chance, he'll beat yer. He'd charm a serpiant vith thews peepers o' hisn.\"  \"Aren't you afraid yourself, then?\"  \"He can't hurt me, for I'm too tough, and I'm noan sighin' for anybody, I ain't; and I hain't a got a good-lookin' jib, and--\"  But here Voltaire entered the room and spoke to Tom Temple.  \"Simon,\" said Tom a second after, \"what colour are the chestnut mare's eyes?\"  Simon heaved himself, struggled, looked vacant, and said dreamily, \"They're loike women, and--waccination, you--you--\" But a film came over his eyes, and he was unconscious.  Again there was deathly silence in the room, and all eyes were turned towards Voltaire, who had walked close to Simon Slowden.  \"The man is not very susceptible,\" said Voltaire, \"consequently I cannot do so much with him as I should had he been more highly organized; but I can at least convince sceptics. You will see,\" he went on, \"that I have not touched him, and yet he is no longer conscious. I will now ask him any question, concerning either the dead or the living, that you may be inclined to ask.\"  \"I will ask a test question,\" said Gertrude Forrest. \"What are the servants doing at this time?\"  \"The cook's examinin' a goose,\" was the reply, \"and the housemaid's talking wi' a chap as is just come from t' village.\"  He went on telling what the rest were doing; but Tom Temple immediately sent to the kitchen, and found that things were as was described.  \"Where's Dr. Sharp?\" said Mrs. Temple, adding that they could easily find out the doctor's present whereabouts the next day.  \"He's comin' up here with his long-nosed pointer,\" was the reply, \"and 'll be 'ere in a jiffy.\"  Five minutes after, Dr. Sharp came into the room. \"I did not know I could come until half-an-hour ago,\" he said as he entered, and then stared as he saw how matters stood.  \"Will you tell me,\" said Miss Forrest, \"what my aunt is doing just now?\"  She mentioned no name, and I do not know how the man sitting in the chair could know anything about her.  \"She is jest gwine to bed,\" he said; \"she's a bit ov a cold in 'er chest, and housekeeper is gwine to take some warmin' stuff to her.\"  \"I'll know if this is true to-morrow,\" said Miss Forrest, and then relapsed into silence.  Meanwhile question after question was asked and answered, while Voltaire and Kaffar stood side by side, each with a terrible glitter in his eyes.  Under some secret influence Simon Slowden was led to the piano, and there executed some of the latest and most difficult pieces of music, and, without hesitation, told things that were at least marvellous. Then, when excitement was at the highest, he woke up, and coolly rubbed his eyes.  No one uttered a word, we were all too much amazed. At last Voltaire, with a sidelong glance at me, asked whether we were convinced, and one by one the members of the party expressed their wonder and astonishment. I, however, was silent. Some power of obstinacy seemed to possess me. I would not tamely admit his victory, after I had openly defeated him before. Still I did not speak a word.  \"Is Mr. Blake convinced?\" said Miss Staggles, leering towards me.  \"Of what?\" I asked.  \"Of Mr. Voltaire's power.\"  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"Come,\" said Kaffar, \"Mr. Blake is still a sceptic. I think it fair that he should consent to test this for himself.\"  \"Certainly not,\" I replied.  \"But I think it our right,\" said Voltaire. \"You have expressed your want of faith in our power; now, if you have the courage of a man with an opinion, test the matter. Sit here as Simon did, and see whether you are right.\"  I thought I heard a voice saying \"Don't!\" close to my ear, and I hesitated.  At this there was a titter among the young ladies.  \"Evidently our Thomas is afraid,\" said Miss Staggles.  There was an ugly look in her eyes as she said this, but the titter increased into a kind of derisive laugh.  I know it was an evidence of my cowardice, but I could not withstand their laughter. I forgot the warning voice behind me; I refused to take notice of Mrs. Temple's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13158"],["title","The Weapons of Mystery (#8)"],["body","glance; I rose up, went to the chair in the middle of the room, and defiantly said, \"There! do all you can with me.\"  Voltaire and Kaffar came up to me, while the rest crowded around. The former fixed his terrible eye upon me as if he would peer into my very soul. A strange feeling began to creep over me; but I struggled against it with all my strength, and for a minute I seemed to gain the mastery. I laughed in his face, as if I scorned his boasted strength. A strange gleam was emitted from his light grey eyes, while his lips became ashy pale. Then I saw him grip Kaffar's hand. Instantly the room was peopled with a strange crowd. Dark forms seemed to come from Voltaire's eyes; peculiar influences were all around me. The faces of the two men became dimmer and dimmer, the people appeared to float in mid air, and I with them; then something heavy seemed to move away, I thought I heard strange creeping noises, like that of an adder crawling amidst thick dry grass, and then all was blank.     CHAPTER VI  AFTERWARDS   When I awoke to consciousness I was in my bedroom. For some time I could not gather up my scattered senses; my mind refused to exercise its proper functions. Presently I heard some one speak.  \"I had no idea he was so far gone,\" a voice said. \"You see, his power of resistance is very great, and it needed four times the magnetism to bring him under that it did your servant.\"  \"I'm sorry you experimented on him at all,\" said another voice.  \"Oh, I can assure you no harm's done. There, you see, he's coming to.\"  I felt something cold at my temples, then a strange shivering sensation passed over me, and I was awake.  Voltaire, Kaffar, Tom Temple, and Simon Slowden were in the room. \"How do you feel, Mr. Blake?\" asked Voltaire, blandly.  I lifted my eyes to his, and felt held by a strange power. \"I'm all right,\" I said almost mechanically, at the same time feeling as if I was under the influence of a charm.  \"Then,\" said Voltaire, \"I will leave you. Good-night.\"  Immediately he left, followed by Kaffar, I experiencing a sense of relief. \"Did I do anything very foolish?\" I asked, recollecting the events of the evening.  \"Oh no, Justin,\" replied Tom. \"And yet that Voltaire is a terrible fellow. Half the young ladies in the room were nearly as much mesmerized as you were. You acted in pretty nearly the same way as Simon here, but nothing else. Do you feel quite right?\"  \"I am awfully weak,\" I said, \"and cold shivers creep down my legs.\"  \"You were such a long time under the influence, whatever it is,\" said Tom. \"But you'll go back to the drawing-room?\"  \"No; I don't feel up to it. But don't you remain. I'm feeling shaky, but I shan't mind a bit if you'll let Simon remain with me.\"  And so Tom left me with Simon. \"Do you feel shaky and shivery, Simon?\" I asked.  \"Not a bit on it, sir,\" was the reply. \"Never felt better. But 'tween you and me and the gatepost, yon hinfidel hain't a served me like he hev you. I don't like the look o' things, yer honour.\"  \"Why, Simon?\"  \"Why, sir, 'tain't me as ought to tell, and yet I don't feel comfortable. I wish I could 'a had a confabulation with yer afore this performance come off. I hain't got no doubts in my mind but that hinfidel and his dootiful brother hev got dealin's with the devil.\"  Simon rose and went to the door, opened it, and peered cautiously around. \"That Egyptian is a watcher,\" he said grimly, \"and I don't like either of 'em.\"  \"What's the matter, Simon?\"  \"Why, this yer morning, I wur exchangin' a few pleasant remarks with one of the maid-servants, when I hears the Egyptian say, 'It's gwine beautiful.' 'How?' says t'other. 'He'll nibble like hanything,' was the answer, and then I hearn a nasty sort o' laugh. Soon after, I see you with a bootiful young lady, and I see that hinfidel a-watchin' yer, with a snaky look in his eyes. And so I kep on watchin', and scuse me, yer honour, but I can guess as 'ow things be, and I'm fear'd as 'ow this waccination dodge is a trick o' this 'ere willain.\"  \"Explain yourself, Simon.\"  \"Well, sir, I knows as 'ow you've only bin yer one day, but I could see in a minit as 'ow you was a smitten with a certain young lady, and I can see, too, as 'ow that white-eyed willain is smitten in the same quarter, and he sees 'ow things be, and he means business.\"  It was by no means pleasant to hear my affairs talked of in this way, and it was a marvel to me how Simon could have learnt so much, but I have found that a certain class of English servant seems to find out everything about the house with which they are connected, and I am afraid I was very careless as to who saw the state of my feelings. At any rate, Simon guessed how things were, and, more than that, he believed that Voltaire had some sinister design against me.  \"What do you mean by what you call the vaccination dodge?\" I asked, after a second's silence.  \"Scuse me, yer honour, but since that doctor waccinated me and nearly killed me by it, tough as I be, I come to call all tomfoolery by the same name. I've been in theatres, yer honour, and played in pieces, and I've known the willain in the play get up a shindy like this. I knows they're on'y got up to 'arrow up the feelin's o' tender females; but I'm afeared as 'ow this Voltaire 'ev got somethin' in his head, a-concoctin' like.\"  \"Nonsense, Simon,\" I said. \"You are thinking about some terrible piece you've acted in, and your imagination is carrying away your judgment.\"  \"I hope as 'ow 'tis, sur; but I don't think so. If you chop me up, sur, you'll not find sixpenno'th of imagination in my carcase, but I calcalate I'm purty 'eavy wi' judgment. Never mind, sur; Simon Slowden is in the 'ouse, if you should want help, sur.\"  I did not feel much inclined to talk after this, and so, dismissing Simon, I began to think of how matters stood. Certainly everything was strange. Everything, too, had been done in a hurry. It seemed to me I had lived a long life in twenty-four hours. I had fallen in love, I had made an enemy, and I had matched myself against men who possessed a knowledge of some of the secret forces of life, without ever calculating my own strength. And yet I seemed to be beating the air. Were not my thoughts concerning Voltaire's schemes about Miss Forrest all fancy? Was not I the victim of some Quixotic ideas? Was not the creation of Cervantes' brain about as sensible as I? Surely I, a man of thirty, ought to know better? And yet some things were terribly real. My love for Gertrude Forrest was real; my walk and talk with her that day were real. Ay, and the hateful glitter of Voltaire's eyes was real too; his talk with Kaffar behind the shrubs the night before was real. The biological or hypnotic power that I had felt that very night was real, and, above all, a feeling of dread that had gripped my being was real. I could not explain it, and I could not throw it off, but ever since I had awoke out of my mesmeric sleep, or whatever the reader may be pleased to call it, I felt numbed; weights seemed to hang on my limbs, and my whole being was in a kind of torpor.  I went to bed at length, however, and, after an hour's tossing, fell asleep, from which I did not wake until ten o'clock next morning. I found, on descending, that nearly all had breakfasted, but the few with whom I spoke were very kind and pleasant towards me. I had no sooner finished breakfast than I met Miss Forrest, and entered into conversation with her. Once with her, all my dreads and fears vanished. Her light eyes and merry laugh drove away dull care, and soon I was in Paradise. Surely I could not be mistaken! Surely the quivering hand, the tremulous mouth, the downcast eye, meant something! Surely she need not be agitated at meeting me, unless she took a special interest in me--unless, indeed, she felt as I felt! At any rate, it were heaven to think so. We had been talking I should think ten minutes, when Tom Temple came towards us.  \"Say, Justin, my boy,\" he said, \"what do you say to a gallop of four?\"  \"Who are the four?\" I asked.  \"Miss Forrest, Miss Edith Gray, Justin Blake, and--myself,\" was the reply.  \"I shall be more than delighted if Miss Forrest will--\" I did not finish the sentence. At that moment I felt gripped by an unseen power, and I was irresistibly drawn towards the door. I muttered something about forgetting, and then, like a man in a sleep, I put on my hat and coat and went out, I know not where.  I cannot remember much about the walk. It was very cold, and my feet crunched the frozen snow; but I thought little of it--I was drawn on and on by some secret power. I was painfully aware that Miss Forrest must think I was acting strangely and discourteously, and once or twice I essayed to go back to her, but I could not I was drawn on and on, always away from the house.  At length I entered a fir wood, and I began to feel more my real self. I saw the dark pines, from whose prickly foliage the snow crystals were falling; I realized a stern beauty in the scene; but I had not time to think about it. I felt I was near the end of my journey, and I began to wonder at my condition. I had not gone far into the wood before I stopped and looked around me. The influence had gone, and I was free; but from behind one of the trees stepped out a man, and the man was--Herod Voltaire!  \"Good-morning, Mr. Justin Blake,\" he said blandly.  \"Why have you brought me here?\" I asked savagely.  He smiled blandly. \"You will admit I have brought you here, then?\" he said. \"Ah, my friend, it is dangerous to fight with a man when you don't know his weapons.\"  \"I want to know what this means?\" I said haughtily.  \"Not so fast,\" he sneered. \"Come down from that high horse and let's talk quietly. Yes, I've no doubt you would have enjoyed a ride with a certain lady better than the lonely walk you have had; but, then, you know the old adage, 'Needs must when the devil drives.'\"  \"And so you've admitted your identity!\" I said. \"Well, I don't want your society; say what"]]]
