DAOUD  Even so, great master.  JOHN BEAL  Daoud, go once more to the palace of the Lord of the Pass and beat the outer door. Say that the great lady herself would see him. The great lady, Miss Clement, the white traveller's heiress.  DAOUD  Yes, master.  JOHN BEAL  Hasten.  [Exit DAOUD.]  I have sent him for Hussein.  MIRALDA  I don't know their language.  JOHN BEAL  You will see him, and I'll tell you what he says.  MIRALDA [to ARCHIE]  Have you been here long?  ARCHIE BEAL  No. I think he wrote to me by the same mail as he wrote to you (if they have mails here). I came at once.  MIRALDA  So did I; but you weren't on the Empress of Switzerland.  ARCHIE BEAL  No, I came round more by land.  JOHN BEAL  You know, I hardly like bringing Hussein in here to see you. He's such a--he's rather a...  MIRALDA  What's the matter with him?  JOHN BEAL  Well, he's rather of the brigand type, and one doesn't know what he'll do.  MIRALDA  Well, we must see him first and hear what he has to say before we take any steps.  JOHN BEAL  But what do you propose to do?  MIRALDA  Why, if he pays me everything he owes, or gives up the security...  JOHN BEAL  The security is the pass.  MIRALDA  Yes. If he gives up that or pays...  JOHN BEAL  You know he's practically king of the whole country. It seems rather cheek almost my sending for him like this.  MIRALDA  He must come.  JOHN BEAL  But what are you going to do?  MIRALDA  If he gives up the pass...  JOHN BEAL  Why, if he gives up the pass you'd be you'd be a kind of queen of it all.  MIRALDA  Well, if he does that, all right...  JOHN BEAL  But what if he doesn't?  MIRALDA  Why, if he doesn't pay...  HUSSEIN [off]  I am here.  JOHN BEAL  Be seen.  [Enter HUSSEIN.]  HUSSEIN  Greeting once more.  JOHN BEAL  Again greeting.... The great lady, Miss Clement, is here.  [HUSSEIN and MIRALDA look at each other.]  You will pay to Miss Clement and not to your god of bronze. On the word of an Englishman, your god of bronze shall not have one gold piece that belongs to the great lady!  HUSSEIN [looking contemptuous]  On the word of the Lord of the Pass, I only pay to Hinnard.  [He stands smiling while MIRALDA regards him. Exit.]  ARCHIE BEAL  Well?  JOHN BEAL  He won't pay.  ARCHIE BEAL  What are we to do now?  JOHN BEAL [to MIRALDA]  I'm afraid he's rather an ugly customer to introduce you to like that. I'm sorry he came now.  MIRALDA  O, I like him, I think he looks splendid.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, what are we to do?  JOHN BEAL  Yes.  ARCHIE BEAL  What do you say, Miss Clement?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, what do you feel we ought to do?  MIRALDA  Well, perhaps I ought to leave all that to you.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, no.  JOHN BEAL  No, it's your money. What do you think we really ought to do?  MIRALDA  Well, of course, I think you ought to kill Hussein.  [JOHN BEAL and ARCHIE BEAL look at each other a little startled.]  JOHN BEAL  But wouldn't that--wouldn't that be--murder?  MIRALDA  O, yes, according to the English law.  JOHN BEAL  I see; you mean--you mean we're not--but we are English.  MIRALDA  I mean it wouldn't be murder--by your law, unless you made it so.  JOHN BEAL  By my law?  MIRALDA  Yes, if you can interfere with their religion like this, and none of them say a word, why--you can make any laws you like.  JOHN BEAL  But Hussein is king here; he is Lord of the Pass, and that's everything here. I'm nobody.  MIRALDA  O, if you like to be nobody, of course that's different.  ARCHIE BEAL  I think she means that if Hussein weren't there there'd be only you. Of course, I don't know. I've only just come.  JOHN BEAL  But we can't kill Hussein!  [MIRALDA begins to cry.]  O Lord! Good heavens! Please, Miss Clement! I'm awfully sorry if I've said anything you didn't like. I wouldn't do that for worlds. I'm awfully sorry. It's a beastly country, I know. I'm really sorry you came. I feel it's all my fault. I'm really awfully sorry...  MIRALDA  Never mind. Never mind. I was so helpless, and I asked you to help me. I never ought to have done it. I oughtn't to have spoken to you at all in that train without being introduced; but I was so helpless. And now, and now, I haven't a penny in the world, and, O, I don't know what to do.  ARCHIE BEAL  We'll do anything for you, Miss Clement.  JOHN BEAL  Anything in the wide world. Please, please don't cry. We'll do anything.  MIRALDA  I... I only, I only wanted to--to kill Hussein. But never mind, it doesn't matter now.  JOHN BEAL  We'll do it, Miss Clement, won't we, Archie? Only don't cry. We'll do it. I--I suppose he deserves it, doesn't he?  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, I suppose he does.  JOHN BEAL  Well, all right, Miss Clement, that's settled. My brother and I will talk it over.  MIRALDA [still sniping]  And--and--don't hang him or anything--he looks so fine.... I--I wouldn't like him treated like that. He has such a grand beard. He ought to die fighting.  JOHN BEAL  We'll see what we can do, Miss Clement.  MIRALDA  It is sweet of you. It's really sweet. It's sweet of both of you. I don't know what I d have done without you. I seemed to know it that day the moment I saw you.  JOHN BEAL  O, it's nothing, Miss Clement, nothing at all.  ARCHIE BEAL  That's all right.  MIRALDA  Well, now I'll have to look for an hotel.  JOHN BEAL  Yes, that's the trouble, that really is the trouble. That's what I've been thinking of  MIRALDA  Why, isn't there...  JOHN BEAL  No, I'm afraid there isn't. What are we to do, Archie.  ARCHIE BEAL  I--I can't think. Perhaps Miss Clement would have a scheme.  MIRALDA [to JOHN BEAL]  I rely on you, Mr. Beal.  JOHN BEAL  I--I; but what can I... You see, you're all alone. If you'd anyone with you, you could have...  MIRALDA  I did think of bringing a rather nice aunt. But on the whole I thought it better not to tell anyone.  JOHN BEAL  Not to tell...  MIRALDA  No, on the whole I didn't.  JOHN BEAL  I say, Archie, what are we to do?  ARCHIE BEAL  Here's Daoud.  [Enter DAOUD.]  JOHN BEAL  The one man I trust in Al Shaldomir!  DAOUD  I have brought two watchers of the doorstep to guard the noble lady.  JOHN BEAL  He says he's brought two watchers of the doorstep to look after Miss Clement.  ARCHIE BEAL  Two chaperons! Splendid! She can go anywhere now.  JOHN BEAL  Well, really, that is better. Yes that will be all right. We can find a room for you now. The trouble was your being alone. I hope you'll like them. [To DAOUD.] Tell them to enter here.  DAOUD [beckoning in the doorway]  Ho! Enter!  JOHN BEAL  That's all right, ARCHIE, isn't it?  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, that's all right. A chaperon's a chaperon, black or white.  JOHN BEAL  You won't mind their being black, will you, Miss Clement?  MIRALDA  No, I shan't mind. They can't be worse than white ones.  [Enter BAZZALOL and THOOTHOOBABA two enormous Nubians, bearing peacock fans and wearing scimitars. All stare at them. They begin to fan slightly.]  DAOUD  The watchers of the doorstep.  JOHN BEAL  Idiot, Daoud! Fools! Dolts! Men may not guard a lady's door.  [BAZZALOL and THOOTHOOBABA smile ingratiatingly.]  We are not men.  BAZZALOL [bowing]  Curtain  Six and a half years elapse   THE SONG OF THE IRIS MARSHES  When morn is bright on the mountains olden  Till dawn is lost in the blaze of day,  When morn is bright and the marshes golden, Where shall the lost lights fade away?  And where, my love, shall we dream to-day?  Dawn is fled to the marshy hollows  Where ghosts of stars in the dimness stray, And the water is streaked with the flash of swallows  And all through summer the iris sway.  But where, my love, shall we dream to-day?  When night is black in the iris marshes.     ACT III  SCENE 1  Six and a half years later. Al Shaldomir. A room in the palace.  MIRALDA reclines on a heap of cushions, JOHN beside her.  Bazzalol and Thoothoobaba fan them.  OMAR [declaiming to a zither]  Al Shaldomir, Al Shaldomir,  The nightingales that guard thy ways Cease not to give thee, after God  And after Paradise, all praise.  Thou art the theme of all their lays. Al Shaldomir, Al Shaldomir....  MIRALDA  Go now, Omar.  OMAR  O lady, I depart. [Exit.]  MIRALDA [languidly]  John, John. I wish you'd marry me.  JOHN  Miralda, you're thinking of those old customs again that we left behind us seven years ago. What's the good of it?  MIRALDA  I had a fancy that I wished you would.  JOHN  What's the good of it? You know you are my beloved. There are none of those clergymen within hundreds of miles. What's the good of it?  MIRALDA  We could find one, John.  JOHN  O, yes, I suppose we could, but...  MIRALDA  Why won't you?  JOHN  I told you why.  MIRALDA  O, yes, that instinct that you must not marry. That's not your reason, John.  JOHN  Yes, it is.  MIRALDA  It's a silly reason. It's a crazy reason. It's no reason at all. There's some other reason.  JOHN  No, there isn't. But I feel that in my bones. I don't know why. You know that I love none else but you. Besides, we're never going back, and it doesn't matter. This isn't Blackheath.  MIRALDA  So I must live as your slave.  JOHN  No, no, Miralda. My dear, you are not my slave. Did not the singer compare our love to the desire of the nightingale for the evening star? All know that you are my queen.  MIRALDA  They do not know at home.  JOHN  Home? Home? How could they know? What have we in common with home? Rows and rows of little houses; and if they hear a nightingale there they write to the papers. And--and if they saw this they'd think they were drunk. Miralda, don't be absurd. What has set you thinking of home?  MIRALDA  I want to be crowned queen.  JOHN  But I am not a king. I am only Shereef.  MIRALDA  You are all-powerful here, John, you can do what you please, if you wish to. You don't love me at all.  JOHN  Miralda, you know I love you. Didn't I kill Hussein for you?  MIRALDA  Yes, but you don't love me now.  JOHN  And Hussein's people killed ARCHIE. That was for you too. I brought my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1311"],["title","If: A Play in Four Acts (#7)"],["body","out here to help you. He was engaged to be married, too.  MIRALDA  But you don't love me now.  JOHN  Yes, I do. I love you as the dawn loves the iris marshes. You know the song they sing. (footnote: poem just before Act III)  MIRALDA  Then why won't you marry me?  JOHN  I told you, I told you. I had a dream about the future. I forgot the dream, but I know I was not to marry. I will not wrong the future.  MIRALDA  Don't be crazy.  JOHN  I will have what fancies I please, crazy or sane. Am I not Shereef of Shaldomir? Who dare stop me if I would be mad as Herod?  MIRALDA  I will be crowned queen.  JOHN  It is not my wish.  MIRALDA  I will, I will, I will.  JOHN  Drive me not to anger. If I have you cast into a well and take twenty of the fairest daughters of Al Shaldomir in your place, who can gainsay me?  MIRALDA  I will be crowned queen.  JOHN  O, do not be tiresome.  MIRALDA  Was it not my money that brought you here? Was it not I who said \"Kill Hussein\"? What power could you have had, had Hussein lived? What would you have been doing now, but for me?  JOHN  I don't know, Miralda.  MIRALDA  Catching some silly train to the City. Working for some dull firm. Living in some small suburban house. It is I, I, that brought you from all that, and you won't make me a queen.  JOHN  Is it not enough that you are my beloved? You know there is none other but you. Is it not enough, Miralda?  MIRALDA  It is not enough. I will be queen.  JOHN  Tchah!... Miralda, I know you are a wonderful woman, the most wonderful in the East; how you ever came to be in the West I don't know, and a train of all places; but, Miralda, you must not have petty whims, they don't become you.  MIRALDA  Is it a petty whim to wish to be a queen?  JOHN  Yes, when it is only the name you want. You are a queen. You have all you wish for. Are you not my beloved? And have I not power here over all men? Could I not close the pass?  MIRALDA  I want to be queen.  JOHN  Oh-h! I will leave you. I have more to do than to sit and hear your whims. When I come back you will have some other whim. Miralda, you have too many whims.  [He rises.]  MIRALDA  Will you be back soon?  JOHN  No.  MIRALDA  When will you come back, John?  [She is reclining, looking fair, fanning slightly.]  JOHN  In half an hour.  MIRALDA  In half an hour?  JOHN  Yes.  [Exit.]  MIRALDA  Half an hour.  [Her fan is laid down. She clutches it with sudden resolve. She goes to the wall, fanning herself slowly. She leans against it. She fans herself now with obvious deliberation. Three times the great fan goes pat against the window, and then again separately three times; and then she puts it against the window once with a smile of ecstasy. She has signalled. She returns to the cushions and reclines with beautiful care, fanning herself softly.  Enter the Vizier, HAFIZ EL ALCOLAHN]  HAFIZ  Lady! You bade me come.  MIRALDA  Did I, Hafiz?  HAFIZ  Lady, your fan.  MIRALDA  Ah, I was fanning myself.  HAFIZ  Seven times, lady.  MIRALDA  Ah, was it? Well, now you're here.  HAFIZ  Lady, O star of these times. O light over lonely marshes. [He kneels by her and embraces her.] Is the Shereef gone, lady?  MIRALDA  For half an hour, Hafiz.  HAFIZ  How know you for half an hour?  MIRALDA  He said so.  HAFIZ  He said so? Then is the time to fear, if a man say so.  MIRALDA  I know him.  HAFIZ  In our country who knows any man so much? None.  MIRALDA  He'll be away for half an hour.  HAFIZ [embracing]  O, exquisite lily of unattainable mountains.  MIRALDA  Ah, Hafiz, would you do a little thing for me?  HAFIZ  I would do all things, lady, O evening star.  MIRANDA  Would you make me a queen, Hafiz?  HAFIZ  If--if the Shereef were gathered?  MIRALDA  Even so, Hafiz.  HAFIZ  Lady, I would make you queen of all that lies west of the passes.  MIRANDA  You would make me queen?  HAFIZ  Indeed, before all my wives, before all women, over all Shaldomir, named the elect.  MIRALDA  O, well, Hafiz; then you may kiss me. [HAFIZ does so ad lib.]  Hafiz, the Shereef has irked me.  HAFIZ  Lady, O singing star, to all men is the hour.  MIRALDA  The appointed hour?  HAFIZ  Even the appointed hour, the last, leading to darkness.  MIRALDA  Is it written, think you, that the Shereef's hour is soon?  HAFIZ  Lady, O dawn's delight, let there be a banquet. Let the great ones of Shaldomir be bidden there.  MIRALDA  There shall be a banquet, Hafiz.  HAFIZ  Soon, O lady. Let it be soon, sole lily of the garden.  MIRALDA  It shall be soon, Hafiz. [More embraces.]  HAFIZ  And above all, O lady, bid Daoud, the son of the baker.  MIRALDA  He shall be bidden, Hafiz.  HAFIZ  O lady, it is well.  MIRALDA  Go now, Hafiz.  HAFIZ  Lady, I go [giving a bag of gold to BAZZALOL]. Silence. Silence. Silence.  BAZZALOL [kneeling]  O, master!  HAFIZ  Let the tomb speak; let the stars cry out; but do you be silent.  BAZZALOL  Aye, master.  HAFIZ [to THOOTHOOBABA]  And you. Though this one speak, yet be silent, or dread the shadow of Hafiz el Alcolahn.  [He drops a bag of gold. THOOTHOOBABA goes down and grabs at the gold; his eyes gloat over it.]  THOOTHOOBABA  Master, I speak not. Oh-h-h.  [Exit HAFIZ.  MIRALDA arranges herself on the cushions. She looks idly at each Nubian. The Nubians put each a finger over his lips and go on fanning with one hand.]  MIRALDA  A queen. I shall look sweet as a queen.  [Enter JOHN. She rises to greet him caressingly.  Enter DAOUD.]  Oh, you have brought Daoud with you.  JOHN  Why not?  MIRALDA  You know that I don't like Daoud.  JOHN  I wish to speak with him.  [MIRALDA looks straight at JOHN and moves away in silence. Exit L.]  JOHN  Daoud.  DAOUD  Great master.  JOHN  Daoud, one day in spring, in the cemetery of those called Blessed, beyond the city's gates, you swore to me by the graves of both your parents....  DAOUD  Great master, even so I swore.  JOHN  .... to be true to me always.  DAOUD  There is no Shereef but my master.  JOHN  Daoud, you have kept your word.  DAOUD  I have sought to, master.  JOHN  You have helped me often, Daoud, warned me and helped me often. Through you I knew those currents that run through the deeps of the market, in silence and all men feel them, but a ruler never. You told me of them, and when I knew--then I could look after myself, Daoud. They could do nothing against me then. Well, now I hold this people. I hold them at last, Daoud, and now --well, I can rest a little.  DAOUD  Not in the East, master.  JOHN  Not in the East, Daoud?  DAOUD  No, master.  JOHN  Why? What do you mean?  DAOUD  In Western countries, master, whose tales I have read, in a wonderful book named the \"Good Child's History of England,\" in the West a man hath power over a land, and lo! the power is his and descends to his son's son after him.  JOHN  Well, doesn't it in the East?  DAOUD  Not if he does not watch, master; in the night and the day, and in the twilight between the day and the night, and in the dawn between the night and the day.  JOHN  I thought you had pretty long dynasties in these parts, and pretty lazy ones.  DAOUD  Master, he that was mightiest of those that were kings in Babylon had a secret door prepared in an inner chamber, which led to a little room, the smallest in the palace, whose back door opened secretly to the river, even to great Euphrates, where a small boat waited all the days of his reign.  JOHN  Did he really now? Well, he was taking no chances. Did he have to use it?  DAOUD  No, master. Such boats are never used. Those that watch like that do not need to seek them, and the others, they would never be able to reach the river in time, even though the boat were there.  JOHN  I shouldn't like to have to live like that. Why, a river runs by the back of this palace. I suppose palaces usually are on rivers. I'm glad I don't have to keep a boat there.  DAOUD  No, master.  JOHN  Well, what is it you are worrying about? Who is it you are afraid of?  DAOUD  Hafiz el Alcolahn.  JOHN  O, Hafiz. I have no fears of Hafiz. Lately I ordered my spies to watch him no longer. Why does he hate me?  DAOUD  Because, most excellent master, you slew Hussein.  JOHN  Slew Hussein? What is that to do with him? May I not slay whom I please?  DAOUD  Even so, master. Even so. But he was Hussein's enemy.  JOHN  His enemy, eh?  DAOUD  For years he had dreamed of the joy of killing Hussein.  JOHN  Well, he should have done it before I came. We don't hang over things and brood over them for years where I come from. If a thing's to be done, it's done.  DAOUD  Even so, master. Hafiz had laid his plans for years. He would have killed him and got his substance; and then, when the hour drew near, you came, and Hussein died, swiftly, not as Hafiz would have had him die; and lo! thou art the lord of the pass, and Hafiz is no more than a beetle that runs about in the dirt.  JOHN  Well, so you fear Hafiz?  DAOUD  Not for himself, master. Nay, I fear not Hafiz. But, master, hast thou seen when the thunder is coming, but no rumble is heard and the sky is scarce yet black, how little winds run in the grass and sigh and die; and the flower beckons a moment with its head; all the world full of whispers, master, all saying nothing; then the lightning, master, and the anger of God; and men say it came without warning? [Simply.] I hear those things coming, master.  JOHN  Well?  DAOUD  Master, it is all silent in the market. Once, when the price of turquoises was high, men abused the Shereef. When the merchant men could not sell their pomegranates for silver they abused the Shereef. It is men's way, master, men's way. Now it is all silent in the market. It is like the grasses with the idle winds, that whisper and sigh and die away; like the flowers beckoning to nothing. And so, master, and so....  JOHN  I see, you fear some danger.  DAOUD  I fear it, master.  JOHN  What danger, Daoud?  DAOUD  Master, I know not.  JOHN  From what quarter, Daoud?  DAOUD  O master, O sole Lord of Al Shaldomir, named the elect, from that quarter.  JOHN "]]]
