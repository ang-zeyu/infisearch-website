Ah me! _One_ wishes he had lived three or four thousand years ago when he stands among those ancient piles. There was some wisdom then, some knowledge of the deep things of life! However, I did not stay here. I went with my friend Kaffar away further into the heart of Nubia.  \"I cannot speak highly of the rank and file of the people there. They are mostly degraded and uncultured, lacking\"--here he bowed to the ladies--\"that delightful polish which characterizes those who live in the West. Still I found some relics of the wisdom of the ancients. One of the sheiks of a village that lay buried among palm trees was deeply versed in the things I longed to know, and with him I took up my abode.  \"Abou al Phadre was an old man, and not one whom the ladies would love--that is, for his face, for it was yellow and wrinkled; his eyes, too, were almost buried in their cavernous sockets, and shaded by bushy white eyebrows. Those who love the higher powers, however, and can respect the divine power of knowledge, would have knelt at Abou's feet.  \"This wonderful man had a daughter born to him in his old age, born, too, with the same love for truth, the same thirst for a knowledge of things unseen to the ordinary eye. So much was this so, that she was called 'Ilfra the Understanding One.' As the years went on she outstripped her father, and obtained a knowledge of that for which her father had unsuccessfully studied all his life.  \"When Kaffar and I entered this village, she was nearly twenty years of age, and was fair to look upon. It was rarely she spoke to me, however, for she dwelt with the unseen and talked with the buried dead. Abou, on the other hand, was kind to me, and taught me much, and together we tried to find out what for years he had been vainly searching. What that secret was I will not tell. Only those who live in the atmosphere of mystery can think rightly about what lies in the mind and heart of the true magician.  \"As I before hinted, 'Ilfra the Understanding One' had found out the secret; her soul had outsoared that of her father and of all the sages for many miles around, and she would have revealed her knowledge both to her father and to me, but for one thing. Seven is a perfect number, and all the Easterns take it into consideration, and it is a law that no one shall reveal a secret that they may have found until three times seven years pass over their heads. Thus it was, while we eagerly sought for the mysterious power I have mentioned, we were buoyed up by the hope that, though we might not be successful, Ilfra would reveal to us what we desired to know.\"  \"And thus the time passed on until we reached Ilfra's twenty-first birthday, with the exception of seven days. Both Abou and I were glad at heart; for although the secret, to me, would be as nothing compared to what it would be to him, yet I could put it to some use, while, to him, it would dispel distance, time, and physical life. Through it the secrets of astronomer and astrologer would be known, while the pages of the past would lie before him like an open book.  \"Judge his anguish then, and my disappointment, when, seven days before her twenty-first birthday, she was bitten by a cerastes, and her body died. Had she been near her home, her knowledge would have defied the powers of this most deadly serpent's bite; for she knew antidotes for every poison. As it was, however, the same kind of serpent that had laid the beautiful Cleopatra low, likewise set at liberty the soul of Ilfra. Do not think Abou grieved because of her death. Death was not death to him--his eyes pierced that dark barrier; he suffered because the glorious knowledge he longed for was rudely snatched from him.\"  \"'Thou man of the West who bearest the name of a Jewish king,' he said to me, 'this is a heavy blow.'  \"'Not too heavy for you, Abou,' I said. 'The soul has flown, but when the three times seven years is complete you can call her back and learn her wisdom.'\"  \"'I can call her back, but the secret--ah, I know it not,' he said.\"  By this time there was a deadly silence in the room. Every ear was strained, so that not one sound of Voltaire's voice might be missed. As for him, he sat with his eyes fixed, as if he saw beyond the present time and place, while his face was like a piece of marble. Kaffar, I noticed, fixed his eyes upon his friend, and in his stony stare he seemed possessed of an evil spirit.  None of the English guests spoke when Voltaire stopped a second in his narration. All seemed afraid to utter a sound, except Kaffar.  \"Go on, Herod,\" he said; \"I am up in Egypt again.\"  \"It was little we ate,\" said Voltaire, \"during the next seven days. We were too anxious to know whether the secrets of the dead were to be revealed. Neither could we speak much, for the tongue is generally silent when the soul is wrapped in mystery; and right glad were we when the day dawned on which the veil should be made thicker or altogether drawn aside.  \"We did not seek to know the mystery after which we were panting until the midnight of Ilfra's birthday. Then, when the earth in its revolution spelt out that hour, we entered the room of the maiden whose soul had departed.  \"The Egyptians have lost much of the knowledge of the ancients, especially in the art of embalming. Often the sons of Egypt moan over that departed wisdom; still the art is not altogether gone. The body of Ilfra lay embalmed before us as we entered. She had been beautiful in life, but was more beautiful in death, and it was with reverence for that beauty that I stood beside her.  \"'Fetch Helfa,' said Abou to a servant, 'and then begone.'  \"Helfa was Abou's son. Here, in England, you would cruelly designate him as something between a madman and an idiot, but the Easterns look not thus upon those who possess not their ordinary faculties. Through Helfa, Abou had seen many wonderful things, and now he was going to use him again.  \"'Howajja Herod,' he said to me, 'I am first going to use one of our old means of getting knowledge. It has failed me in the past, but it will be, perchance, more potent in the presence of Ilfra the Understanding One.'  \"With that he took some ink, and poured it in Helfa's hand. This ink was the most precious in his possession, and obtained by means not lawful to relate. When it was in his son's hands he looked at me straight in the eyes, until, while I was in possession of all my senses, I seemed to live a charmed life. My imagination soared, my heart felt a wondrous joy.  \"'Look,' said Abou, 'look in Helfa's hand.'  \"I looked intently.  \"'What see you, son Herod?'  \"'I see a paradise,' I replied, 'but I cannot describe it. The beauties are incomparable. Ilfra is there; she mingles with those who are most obeyed.'  \"'See you anything by which the mystery can be learned?'  \"'I can see nothing.'  \"I heard a sigh. I had returned to my normal condition again, and had told nothing.  \"'I expected this,' he said, 'but I will try Helfa.'  \"The experiment with Helfa, however, was just as fruitless.  \"Then he turned to me. 'Son Herod,' he said, 'prepare to see the greatest deed ever done by man. All the knowledge and power of my life are to be concentrated in one act.'  \"With that he looked at Helfa, who staggered to a low cushion.  \"'Spirit of Helfa, leave the body,' he said.  \"Instantly the eyes of Helfa began to close; his limbs grew stiff, and in a few seconds he lay lifeless by us.  \"'I have a mission for you, spirit of Helfa. Flee to the home of spirits, and bring back the soul of thy sister, that she may tell me what we wish to know.'  \"When the command was given, I felt that a something--an entity--was gone from us. Abou and I were alone with the two bodies.  \"'What expect you, Abou?' I said, anxiously.  \"'If the labour of a lifetime has not been a failure,' he said, 'these two bodies will soon possess their spirits.'\"  Again Voltaire stopped in his recital, and looked around the room. He saw that every eye was fixed upon him, while the faces of some of the young ladies were blanched with terror. Evidently they were deeply moved. Even some of the young men shuddered, not so much because of the story that was told, as the strange power of the man that told it. As he saw these marks of interest, a smile crept over his face. He evidently felt that he was the strongest influence in the room--that all had to yield to him as their superior.  \"I confess,\" he went on, \"that my heart began to beat quickly at these words. Fancy, if you can, the scene. An Egyptian village, not far removed from some of the great temples of the dead past. Above our heads waved tall palm trees. Around was a strange land, and a wild, lawless people. The hour was midnight, and our business was with the dead.  \"We had not waited above three minutes when I knew that the room was peopled--by whom I knew not, except that they came from that land from whose bourne, your greatest poet says, 'no traveller returns.' I looked at Abou. His face was as the face of the dead, except for his eyes. They burned like two coals of fire. He uttered some strange words, the meaning of which was unknown to me, and then I knew some mighty forces were being exerted in that old sheik's hut. My brain began to whirl, while a terrible power gripped me; but still I looked, and still I remembered.  \"'Spirit of Ilfra,' said Abou, 'are you here?'  \"No voice spoke that I could hear, and yet I realized that Abou had received his answer.  \"'Enter thy body then, spirit of my daughter, and tell me, if thou darest, the secret I have desired so long.'  \"I looked at the embalmed body. I saw the eyelids quiver, the mouth twitch, and then the body moved.  \"'Speak to me, my daughter, and tell me all,' said Abou.  \"I only heard one sound. My overtaxed nerves could bear no more; the living dead was too terrible for me, and I fell senseless to the ground.  \"When I awoke to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13158"],["title","The Weapons of Mystery (#6)"],["body","ness, I found only Abou and Helfa there. The body of Ilfra had been removed, where, I know not, for I never saw it again; but Helfa was like unto that which he had been before.  \"'The secret is mine, son Herod,' said Abou, 'but it is not for you to learn yet. Be patient; when your spirit is prepared, the knowledge will come.'\"  Voltaire stopped abruptly. One of the young ladies gave a slight scream, and then he apologized for having no more to tell.  \"But has the knowledge come since?\" asked a voice.  I did not know who spoke, but it sounded like Gertrude Forrest's voice. I turned towards her, and saw her looking admiringly at this man whom I could not help fearing.  His answer was a beaming smile and a few words, saying that knowledge should never be boasted of.  That moment my jealousy, which had been allayed, now surged furiously in me, and I determined that that very night I would match the strength of my mind with the strength of his.     CHAPTER V  CHRISTMAS NIGHT--THE FORGING OF THE CHAIN   \"You have more than redeemed your promise, Voltaire,\" said Tom Temple, after a silence that was almost painful. \"Certainly there is enough romance and mystery in your story to satisfy any one. What do you think of it, Justin?\"--turning to me.  \"Mr. Voltaire used the word 'imagination' in his story,\" I replied, \"and I think it would describe it very well. Still, it does not account for much after one has read Dumas' _Memoirs of a Physician_.\"  \"Am I to understand that you doubt the truth of my words?\" asked Voltaire sharply.  \"I think your story is all it appears to be,\" I replied.  Honestly, however, I did not believe in one word of it. On the very face of it, it was absurd. The idea of taking a spirit from a living body and sending it after some one that was dead, in order that some secret might be learned, might pass for a huge joke; but certainly it could not be believed in by any well-balanced mind. At any rate, such was my conviction.  \"I have heard that Mr. Blake has attempted to write a novel,\" said Voltaire. \"Perhaps he believes my story is made on the same principle.\"  \"Scarcely,\" I replied. \"My novel was a failure. It caused no sensation at all. Your story, on the other hand, is a brilliant success. See with what breathless interest it was listened to, and how it haunts the memories of your hearers even yet!\"  This raised a slight titter. I do not know why it should, save that some of the young ladies were frightened, and accepted the first opportunity whereby they could in some way relieve their feelings. Anyhow it aroused Mr. Voltaire, for, as he looked at me, there was the look of a demon in his face, and his hand trembled.  \"Do you doubt the existence of the forces I have mentioned?\" he asked. \"Do you think that the matters to which I have referred exist only in the mind? Are they, in your idea, no sciences in reality?\"  \"Pardon me, Mr. Voltaire,\" I replied, \"but I am an Englishman. We are thought by foreigners to be very conservative, and perhaps there may be truth in it. Anyhow, I, for one, like tangible proof before I believe in anything that does not appeal to my reason. Your story does not appear reasonable, and, although I hope I do not offend you by saying so, I cannot accept it as gospel.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Kaffar, who spoke for the first time, \"Mr. Blake would like some proofs. Perhaps he would like not only to _see_ manifestations of the power of the unseen, but to _feel_ them. Ah! pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, but I cannot stand by and hear the greatest of all sciences maligned, and still be quiet. I cannot be silent when that which is dearer to me than life itself is submitted to the cool test of bigoted ignorance. You may not believe it true, but I would give much to know what Ilfra the Understanding One knew. I was reared under Egypt's sunny skies; I have lain under her stately palms and watched the twinkling stars; I am a child of the East, and believe in the truths that are taught there. I have only dabbled in the mysteries of the unseen, but I know enough to tell you that what my friend says is true.\"  Was this a ruse on the part of the Egyptian? Looking at the whole matter in the light of what followed I believe it was. And yet at the time I did not know.  \"I am sorry,\" I replied, \"if I have caused annoyance. But we English people possess the right of our opinions. However, I do not wish to bias other minds, and trust that my scepticism may cause no unpleasantness.\"  \"But would Mr. Blake like to be convinced?\" said Voltaire.  \"I am perfectly indifferent about the matter,\" I replied.  \"That is very convenient for one who has stated his beliefs so doggedly. Certainly I do not think that is English; if it is, I am glad I am not an Englishman.\"  With this he fixed his eyes steadily on me, and tried to fasten my attention, but did not at the time succeed.  \"I was asked for my opinion,\" I said; \"I did not force it. But still, since you place it in that light, I _should_ like to be convinced.\"  By this time the interest manifested in the matter was great. Every one watched breathlessly for what was to be done or said next, and certainly I felt that I was regarded by the guests in anything but a favourable light.  I saw Voltaire and Kaffar exchanging glances, and I felt sure that I heard the former say in Arabic, \"Not yet.\"  After this the two arranged to give us some manifestations of their power. While they were conversing I went across the room and spoke to Miss Forrest; but she was very reserved, and I thought her face looked very pale.  \"This is becoming interesting,\" I said.  \"I wish you had said nothing about his story,\" was her reply.  \"Pray why?\"  She only shook her head.  \"Surely you do not believe in his foolish story or conjuring tricks?\" I said laughingly.  But she did not reply in the same vein.  \"Mr. Voltaire is a wonderful man,\" she said, \"a clever man. If I were a man I should not like to make him my enemy.\"  \"I have heard of an old saying at my home,\" I replied, \"which ran something like this, 'Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is better.'\"  \"Still I should have nothing to do with Brag,\" she said.  \"I hope you will not,\" I replied meaningly.  She did not answer me, but I fancied she blushed; and again I felt happy.  By this time Voltaire was ready with his performance. \"You will see,\" he said, \"that here we have no chance for stage tricks. All is plain and open as the day. Moreover, I will have no secrets from you even with regard to the subject itself. The phenomena that will be brought before you are purely psychological. The mind of my friend Kaffar will be, by a secret power, merged into mine. What I see he will see, although in your idea of the matter he does not see at all. Now, first of all, I wish you to blindfold my friend Kaffar. Perhaps Mr. Blake, seeing he longs for truth, may like to do this. No? Well, then, perhaps our host will. Thank you, Mr. Temple.\"  With this Tom Temple completely blindfolded the Egyptian, and then we awaited the further development of the matter.  \"Would you mind leading him to the library?\" Voltaire continued. \"He will certainly not be able to see anything of us here, and still he will not be out of earshot.\"  Kaffar was accordingly led into the library, blindfolded.  \"Now,\" said Voltaire, \"I told you that by a secret power his mind and mine became one. I will prove to you that I have not spoken boastingly. Will any gentleman or lady show me any curiosity he or she may have?\"  Accordingly several of the party pulled from their pockets articles of interest, and of which neither Voltaire nor Kaffar could have known. Each time the former asked what the article was, and each time the latter, although at a distance, correctly described it.  A look of wonder began to settle on the faces of the guests, and exclamations of surprise and bewilderment were apparent. It was apparent that nearly all were converts to his beliefs, if beliefs they might be called. After a number of articles were shown and described, Kaffar was recalled, and was loudly applauded.  \"You see,\" said Voltaire, \"the evident truth of this. Certainly this is a very simple affair, and my old friend Abou al Phadre would have smiled at its littleness. Still it must convince every unprejudiced mind that there is something deeper and more wonderful than those things which are constantly passing before your view.\"  Miss Staggles, who had been almost as silent as a sphinx, spoke now. \"We are convinced that you are a wonderful man,\" she said; \"and what I have seen to-night will be ever a matter of marvel, as well as thankfulness that I have been privileged to see it.\"  This was evidently the opinion of every one in the room. Even Gertrude Forrest was carried away by it, while Miss Edith Gray was enraptured at what she termed \"a glorious mystery.\"  \"I should like,\" said Miss Staggles, \"to hear what Mr. Blake, the Thomas of the party, has to say to it.\"  There was an ugly leer in the old woman's eye as she spoke, and the thought struck me that Voltaire had been making friends with her.  \"Yes,\" said Voltaire; \"I am sure we should all like to know whether Mr. Blake is convinced.\"  \"I am convinced that Mr. Kaffar has a good memory,\" I said.  \"Good memory! What do you mean?\"  \"Why, Mr. Voltaire and his friends have come a few years too late to make a good impression. I have not only seen a better performance at a dozen entertainments, but I have found out the secret of what is called 'thought-reading.'\"  \"Do you mean to say you have seen similar feats before?\" asked Voltaire, savagely.  \"At least a dozen times,\" I replied. \"In a few years' time, we shall see the like performed on the sands at our fashionable watering-places.\"  \"I am glad,\" said Kaffar, \"that the education of your country has so far advanced.\"  I went on talking, not realizing that I was all the time forging a chain that should hold me in cruel bondage. \"I am afraid it says very little for our education,\" I replied. \"Some"]]]
