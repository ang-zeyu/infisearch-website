It was by no means unlikely that we also might be attacked, if it was true that the king's men were outnumbered, as was said.  Now when my father went to say farewell to us, nowhere could be found my brother Withelm.  \"The boy has gone to watch the muster,\" my father said. \"I shall see him there presently.\"  Then, because he saw that my mother was troubled more than her wont, he added, \"Have no fear for me. This will be no more than a raid of Norsemen, and they will plunder and be away with the tide before we get to the place.\"  So he laughed and went out, having done his best to cheer us all, and I went with him to where the men were gathered in their arms in the wide space in the midst of the houses. There I sought for little Withelm, but could not find him among the women and children who looked on; and before we had been there more than a few minutes the jarl gave the word, and the march was begun. There were about fifteen miles to be covered between our town and the king's.  I watched them out of sight, and then went home, having learned that I was to be called out only in case of need. And as I drew near the homestead I saw a light in the little ash grove that was behind the garth.[3] In the midst of the trees, where this light seemed to be, was our wooden image of Thor the Hammer Bearer, older than any of us could tell; and in front of this was what we used as his altar ---four roughly-squared stones set together. These stones were blue-black in colour, and whence they came I do not know, unless it was true that my forefathers brought them here when first Odin led his folk to the northern lands. Always they had been the altar for my people, and my father held that we should have no luck away from them.  So it was strange to see a light in that place, where none would willingly go after dark, and half was I feared to go and see what it might mean. But then it came into my mind that the enemy might be creeping on the house through the grove, and that therefore I must needs find out all about it. So I went softly to the nearest trees, and crept from one to another, ever getting closer to the light; and I will say that I feared more that I might see some strange thing that was more than mortal than that I should see the leading foeman stealing towards me. But presently it was plain that the light did not move as if men carried it, but it flickered as a little fire; and at last I saw that it burned on the altar stones, and that frightened me so that I almost fled.  Maybe I should have done so, but that I heard a voice that I knew; and so, looking once more, I saw a figure standing before the fire, and knew it. It was little Withelm, and why a ten-year-old boy should be here I could not think. But I called him softly, and he started somewhat, turning and trying to look through the darkness towards me, though he did not seem afraid. There was a little fire of dry sticks burning on the stones, and the gaunt old statue seemed to look more terrible than ever in its red blaze. One might have thought that the worn face writhed itself as the light played over it.  \"It is I, Withelm,\" I said softly, for the fear of the place was on me. \"We have sought you everywhere, and father would have wished you farewell. What are you doing here?\"  I came forward then, for it was plain that the child feared nothing, so that I was put to shame. And as I came I asked once more what he was doing in this place.  \"The jarl has surely forgotten the sacrifice to the Asir before the warriors went to fight, and they will be angry,\" he answered very calmly. \"It is right that one should remember, and I feared for father, and therefore---\"  He pointed to the altar, and I saw that he had laid his own untasted supper on the fire that he had lighted, and I had naught to say. The thing was over-strange to me, who thought nothing of these things. It was true that the host always sacrificed before sailing on the Viking path, but tonight had been urgent haste.  \"Thor will not listen to any but a warrior,\" I said. \"Come home, brother, for mother waits us.\"  \"If not Thor, who is maybe busy at the battle they talk of, then do I think that All Father will listen,\" he said stoutly. \"But this was all that I had to make sacrifice withal, and it may not be enough.\"  \"The jarl will make amends when he comes back,\" I said, wishing to get home and away from this place, and yet unwilling to chide the child. \"Now let us go, for mother will grow anxious.\"  With that he put his hand in mine, and we both saluted Thor, as was fitting, and then went homeward. It seemed to me that the glare in the north was fiercer now than when I had first seen it.  Now, after my mother had put Withelm to bed, I told her how I had found him; and thereat she wept a little, as I could see in the firelight.  After a long silence she said, \"Strange things and good come into the mind of a child, and one may learn what his fate shall be in the days to come. I am sure from this that Withelm will be a priest.\"  Now as one may buy the place of a godar, with the right to have a temple of the Asir for a district and the authority that goes therewith, if so be that one falls vacant or is to be given up by the holder, this did not seem unlikely, seeing how rich we were fast growing. And indeed my mother's saying came to pass hereafter, though not at all in the way of which we both thought.  There was no alarm that night. The old warriors watched round the town and along the northern tracks, but saw nothing, and in the morning the black smoke hung over the place of the burning, drifting slowly seaward. The wind had changed, and they said that it would doubtless have taken the foe away with it, as my father had hoped. So I went down to the ship with Raven, and worked at the few things that were still left to be done to her as she lay in her long shed on the slips, ready to take the water at any tide. She was only waiting for cargo and stores to be put on board her with the shift of wind that had come at last, and I thought that my father would see to these things as soon as he came back.  Now in the evening we had news from the Jarl, and strange enough it was. My father came back two days afterwards and told us all, and so I may as well make a short story of it. The ways of Gunnar Kirkeban had been his end, for a certain Viking chief, a Norseman, had wintered in Wales during the past winter, and there he had heard from the Welsh of the wrongs that they had suffered at his hands. Also he had heard of the great booty of Welsh gold that Gunnar had taken thence in the last summer; and so, when these Welsh asked that he would bide with them and help fight the next Danes who came, he had offered to do more than that ---he would lead them to Gunnar's place if they would find men to man three ships that he had taken, and would be content to share the booty with them.  The Welsh king was of the line of Arthur, and one who yet hoped to win back the land of his fathers from the Saxons and English; and so he listened to this Hodulf, thinking to gain a powerful ally in him for attack on the eastern coast of England after this. So, favoured by the wind that had kept us from the sea, Hodulf, with twenty ships in all, had fallen on Gunnar unawares, and had had an easy victory, besetting the town in such wise that only in the confusion while the wild Welsh were burning and plundering on every side had the messenger to the jarl been able to slip away.  But when the jarl and our men reached the town there was naught to be done but to make terms with Hodulf as best he might, that the whole country might not be overrun. For Gunnar had been slain in his own hall, with his two young daughters and with the queen also, as was supposed. Havelok the prince was in his hands, and for his sake therefore Sigurd had been the more ready to come to terms.  Then Hodulf sent messengers to the overlord of all Denmark, saying that he would hold this kingdom as for him, and backed up that promise with a great present from Gunnar's treasure, so that he was listened to. Therefore our jarl was helpless; and there being no other king strong enough to aid him if he rose, in the end he had to take Hodulf for lord altogether, though it went sorely against the grain.  I have heard it said by the Welsh folk that Hodulf held the kingdom for their lord; and it is likely that he humoured them by saying that he would do so, which was a safe promise to make, as even King Arthur himself could never have reached him to make him pay scatt.       CHAPTER II. KING HODULF'S SECRET.  My father came home heavy and anxious enough, for he did not know how things would go under this new king, though he had promised peace to all men who would own him. We in our place saw nothing of him or his men for the next few weeks, but he was well spoken of by those who had aught to do with him elsewhere. So my father went on trying to gather a cargo for England; but it was a slow business, as the burnt and plundered folk of the great town had naught for us, and others sold to them. But he would never be idle, and every day when weather served we went fishing, for he loved his old calling well, as a man will love that which he can do best. Our two boats and their gear were always in the best of order, and our kinsman, Arngeir, used and tended them when we were away in the ship in summertime.  Now, one evening, as we came up from the shore after beaching the boat on the hard below the town, and half a mile from the nearest houses, and being, as one may suppose, not altogether in holiday trim, so that Grim and his boys with their loads of fish and nets looked as though a fisher's hovel were all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12847"],["title","Havelok the Dane: A Legend of Old Grimsby and Lincoln (#3)"],["body"," home that they might own, we saw a horseman, followed at a little distance by two more, riding towards us. The dusk was gathering, and at first we thought that this was Jarl Sigurd, who would ask us maybe to send fish to his hall, and so we set our loads down and waited for him.  But it was not our lord, and I had never seen this man before. From his arms, which were of a new pattern to me, he might be one of the host of Hodulf, as I thought.  \"Ho, fisher!\" he cried, when he was yet some way from us; \"leave your lads, and come hither. I have a word for you.\"  He reined up and waited, and now I was sure that he was a Norseman, for his speech was rougher than ours. He was a tall, handsome man enough; but I liked neither his voice nor face, nor did I care to hear Grim, my father, summoned in such wise, not remembering that just now a stranger could not tell that he was aught but a fisher thrall of the jarl's.  But my father did as he was asked, setting down the nets that he was carrying, and only taking with him the long boathook on which he had slung them as he went forward. I suppose he remembered the old saying, that a man should not stir a step on land without his weapons, as one never knows when there may be need of them; and so, having no other, he took this.  I heard the first questions that the man asked, for he spoke loudly.  \"Whose man are you?\"  \"Sigurd's,\" answered my father shortly.  \"Whose are the boats?\"  \"Mine, seeing that I built them.\"  \"Why, then, there is somewhat that you can do for me,\" the horseman said. \"Is your time your own, however?\"  \"If the jarl needs me not.\"  \"Tonight, then?\"  \"I have naught to do after I have carried the nets home.\"  \"That is well,\" said the stranger; and after that he dropped his voice so that I heard no more, but he and my father talked long together.  We waited, and at last the talk ended, and my father came hack to us, while the stranger rode away northward along the sands. Then I asked who the man was, and what he wanted.  \"He is some chief of these Norsemen, and one who asks more questions of a thrall, as he thinks me, than he would dare ask Sigurd the jarl, or Grim the merchant either, for that matter.\"  Seeing that my father did not wish to say more at this time, we asked nothing else, but went homeward in silence. It seemed as if he was ill at ease, and he went more quickly than was his wont, so that presently Raven and little Withelm lagged behind us with their burdens, for our catch had been a good one.  Then he stopped outside the garth when we reached home, and told me not to go in yet. And when the others came up he said to them, \"Do you two take in the things and the fish, and tell mother that Radbard and I have to go down to the ship. There is cargo to be seen to, and it is likely that we shall he late, so bid her not wait up for us.\"  Then he told me to come, and we left the two boys at once and turned away towards the haven. There was nothing strange in this, for cargo often came at odd times, and we were wont to work late in stowing it. I did wonder that we had not stayed to snatch a bit of supper, but it crossed my mind that the Norseman had told my father of some goods that had maybe been waiting for the whole day while we were at sea. And then that did not seem likely, for he had taken us for thralls. So I was puzzled, but held my peace until it should seem good to my father to tell me what we were about.  When we reached a place where there was no house very near and no man about, he said to me at last, \"What is on hand I do not rightly know, but yon man was Hodulf, the new king, as I suppose we must call him. He would not tell me his name, but I saw him when he and the jarl made terms the other day. Now he has bidden me meet him on the road a mile from the town as soon as it is dark, and alone. He has somewhat secret for me to do.\"  \"It is a risk to go alone and unarmed,\" I answered; \"let me go home and get your weapons, for the errand does not seem honest.\"  \"That is what I think also,\" said my father, \"and that is why I am going to meet him. It is a bad sign when a king has a secret to share with a thrall, and I have a mind to find out what it is. There may be some plot against our jarl.\"  He was silent for a few minutes, as if thinking, and then he went on.  \"I cannot take arms, or he would suspect me, and would tell me nothing; but if there is any plotting to be done whereof I must tell the jarl, it will be as well that you should hear it.\"  Then he said that he thought it possible for me to creep very close to the place where he was to meet Hodulf, so that I could hear all or most of what went on, and that I might as well be armed in case of foul play, for he did not suppose that the Norseman would think twice about cutting down a thrall who did not please him.  It was almost dark by this time, and therefore he must be going. I was not to go home for arms, but to borrow from Arngeir as we passed his house. And this I did, saying that I had an errand beyond the town and feared prowling men of the Norse host. Which danger being a very reasonable one, Arngeir offered to go with me; and I had some difficulty in preventing him from doing so, for he was like an elder brother to all of us. However, I said that I had no great distance to go, and feigned to be ashamed of myself for my fears; and he laughed at me, and let me go my way with sword and spear and seax[4] also, which last my father would take under his fisher's jerkin.  I caught up my father quickly, and we went along the sands northwards until we came to the place where we must separate. The road was but a quarter of a mile inland from this spot, for it ran near the shore, and it was not much more than that to the place where Hodulf would be waiting.  \"Creep as near as you can,\" my father said; \"but come to help only if I call. I do not think that I am likely to do so.\"  Then we went our ways, he making straight for the road, and I turning to my left a little. It was dark, for there was no moon now, but save that I was soundly scratched by the brambles of the fringe of brushwood that grew all along the low hills of the coast, there was nothing to prevent my going on quickly, for I knew the ground well enough, by reason of yearly bird nesting. When I reached the roadway the meeting place was yet to my left, and I could hear my father's footsteps coming steadily in the distance. So I skirted the road for a little way, and then came to an open bit of heath and rising land, beyond which I thought I should find Hodulf. Up this I ran quickly, dropping into the heather at the top; and sure enough, in a hollow just off the road I could dimly make out the figure of a mounted man waiting.  Then my father came along the road past me, and I crawled among the tall heather clumps until I was not more than twenty paces from the hollow, which was a little below me.  Hodulf's horse winded me, as I think, and threw up its head snorting, and I heard its bit rattle. But my father was close at hand, and that was lucky.  \"Ho, fisher, is that you?\" he called softly.  \"I am here,\" was the answer, and at once my father came into the hollow from the road.  \"Are any folk about?\" Hodulf said.  \"I have met none. Now, what is all this business?\" answered my father.  \"Business that will make a free man of you for the rest of your days, and rich, moreover, master thrall,\" said Hodulf. \"That is, if you do as I bid you.\"  \"A thrall can do naught else than what he is bidden.\"  \"Nay, but he can do that in a way that will earn great reward, now and then; and your reward for obedience and silence thereafter in this matter shall be aught that you like to ask.\"  \"This sounds as if I were to peril my life,\" my father said. \"I know naught else that can be worth so much as that might be.\"  \"There is no peril,\" said Hodulf scornfully; \"your skin shall not be so much as scratched---ay, and if this is well done it will know a master's dog whip no more.\"  I heard my father chuckle with a thrall's cunning laugh at this, and then he said eagerly, \"Well, master, what is it?\"  \"I will tell you. But first will you swear as on the holy ring that of what you shall do for me no man shall know hereafter?\"  \"What I do at your bidding none shall know, and that I swear,\" answered my father slowly, as if trying to repeat the king's words.  \"See here, then,\" said Hodulf, and I heard his armour clatter as he dismounted.  Then the footsteps of both men shuffled together for a little while, and once I thought I heard a strange sound as of a muffled cry, at which Hodulf muttered under his breath. I could see that they took something large from the saddle bow, and set it on the ground, and then they spoke again.  \"Have you a heavy anchor?\" asked the king.  \"A great one.\"  \"Well, then, tie it to this sack and sink it tonight where tide will never shift it. Then you may come to me and claim what reward you will.\"  \"Freedom, and gold enough to buy a new boat---two new boats!\" said my father eagerly.  Hodulf laughed at that, and got on his horse again. I saw his tall form lift itself against the dim sky as he did so.  \"What is in the sack?\" asked my father.  \"That is not your concern,\" Hodulf answered sharply. \"If you know not, then you can tell no man, even in your sleep. Put off at once and sink it.\"  \"It is in my mind,\" said my father, \"that I had better not look in the sack. Where shall I find you, lord, when the thing is in the sea? For as yet I have not heard your name.\"  I think that Hodulf had forgotten that he would have to answer this question, or else he thought that everyone knew him, for he did not reply all at once.  \"You may ask the king for your reward,\" he said, after a little thought, \"for this is his business. Now you know that it will be best for you to be secret and sure. Not much worth will your chance of escape from torture be if this becomes known. But you know also that the reward is certain.\"  \"The king!\" cried my father,"]]]
