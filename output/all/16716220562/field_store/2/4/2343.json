MARY  I'd rather you didn't, John.  JOHN  But why?  MARY  O, John, suppose there's a railway accident? You might be killed, and we should never meet.  JOHN  There wasn't.  MARY  There wasn't, John? What do you mean?  JOHN  There wasn't an accident to the eight-fifteen. It got safely to London just ten years ago.  MARY  Why, nor there was.  JOHN  You see how groundless your fears are. I shall catch that train, and all the rest will happen the same as before. Just think Mary, all those old days again. I wish I could take you with me. But you soon will be. But just think of the old days coming back again. Hampton Court again and Kew, and Richmond Park again with all the May. And that bun you bought, and the corked ginger-beer, and those birds singing and the 'bus past Isleworth. O, Mary, you wouldn't grudge me that?  MARY  Well, well then all right, John.  JOHN  And you will remember there wasn't an accident, won't you?  MARY [resignedly, sadly]  O, yes, John. And you won't try to get rich or do anything silly, will you?  JOHN  No, Mary. I only want to catch that train. I'm content with the rest. The same things must happen, and they must lead me the same way, to you, Mary. Good night, now, dear.  MARY  Good night?  JOHN  I shall stay here on the sofa holding the crystal and thinking. Then I'll have a biscuit and start at seven.  MARY  Thinking, John? What about?  JOHN  Getting it clear in my mind what I want to do. That one thing and the rest the same. There must be no mistakes.  MARY [sadly]  Good night, John.  JOHN  Have supper ready at eleven.  MARY  Very well, John. [Exit.]  JOHN [on the sofa, after a moment or two]  I'll catch that infernal train in spite of him.  [He takes the crystal and closes it up in the palm of his left hand.]  I wish to go back ten years, two weeks and a day, at, at--8.10 a.m. to-morrow; 8.10 a.m. to-morrow, 8.10.  [Re-enter MARY in doorway.]  MARY  John! John! You are sure he did get his fifty pounds?  JOHN  Yes. Didn't he come to thank me for the money?  MARY  You are sure it wasn't ten shillings?  JOHN  Cater paid him, I didn't.  MARY  Are you sure that Cater didn't give him ten shillings?  JOHN  It's the sort of silly thing Cater would have done!  MARY  O, John!  JOHN  Hmm.   Curtain    SCENE 3  Scene: As in Act I, Scene 1. Time. Ten years ago.  BERT  'Ow goes it, Bill?  BILL  Goes it? 'Ow d'yer think it goes?  BERT  I don't know, Bill. 'Ow is it?  BILL  Bloody.  BERT  Why, what's wrong?  BILL  Wrong? Nothing ain't wrong.  BERT  What's up, then?  BILL  Nothing ain't right.  BERT  Why, wot's the worry?  BILL  Wot's the worry? They don't give you better wages nor a dog, and then they thinks they can talk at yer and talk at yer, and say wot they likes, like.  BERT  Why? You been on the carpet, Bill?  BILL  Ain't I! Proper.  BERT  Why? Wot about, Bill?  BILL  Wot about? I'll tell yer. Just coz I let a lidy get into a train. That's wot about. Said I ought to 'av stopped 'er. Thought the train was moving. Thought it was dangerous. Thought I tried to murder 'er, I suppose.  BERT  Wot? The other day?  BILL  Yes.  BERT?  Tuesday?  BILL  Yes.  BERT  Why? The one that dropped her bag?  BILL  Yes. Drops 'er bag. Writes to the company. They writes back she shouldn't 'av got in. She writes back she should. Then they gets on to me. Any more of it and I'll...  BERT  I wouldn't, Bill; don't you.  BILL  I will.  BERT  Don't you, Bill. You've got your family to consider.  BILL  Well, anyway, I won't let any more of them passengers go jumping into trains any more, not when they're moving, I won't. When the train gets in, doors shut. That's the rule, and they'll have to abide by it.  [Enter JOHN BEAL.]  BILL [touching his hat] Good morning, sir.  [JOHN does not answer, but walks to the door between them.]  Carry your bag, sir?  JOHN  Go to hell!  [Exit through door.]  BILL  Ullo.  BERT  Somebody's been getting at 'im.  BILL  Well, I never did. Why, I knows the young feller.  BERT  Pleasant spoken, ain't 'e, as a rule?  BILL  Never knew 'im like this.  BERT  You ain't bin sayin' nothing to 'im, 'ave yer?  BILL  Never in my life.  BERT  Well, I never.  BILL  'Ad some trouble o' some kind.  BERT  Must 'ave.  [Train is heard.]  BILL  Ah, 'ere she is. Well, as I was saying...  Curtain  SCENE 4  In a second-class railway carriage.  Time: Same morning as Scene 1, Act I.  Noise, and a scene drawn past the windows. The scene, showing a momentary glimpse of fair English hills, is almost entirely placards, \"GIVE HER BOVRIL,\" \"GIVE HER OXO,\" alternately, for ever.  Occupants, JOHN BEAL, a girl, a man.  All sit in stoical silence like the two images near Luxor. The man has the window seat, and therefore the right of control over the window.  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Would you mind having the window open?  THE MAN IN THE CORNER [shrugging his shoulders in a shivery way]  Er--certainly. [Meaning he does not mind. He opens the window.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Thank you so much.  MAN IN THE CORNER  Not at all. [He does not mean to contradict her. Stoical silence again.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Would you mind having it shut now? I think it is rather cold.  MAN IN THE CORNER  Certainly.  [He shuts it. Silence again.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  I think I'd like the window open again now for a bit. It is rather stuffy, isn't it?  MAN IN THE CORNER  Well, I think it's very cold.  MIRALDA CLEMENT  O, do you? But would you mind opening it for me?  MAN IN THE CORNER  I'd much rather it was shut, if you don't mind.  [She sighs, moves her hands slightly, and her pretty face expresses the resignation of the Christian martyr in the presence of lions. This for the benefit of John.]  JOHN  Allow me, madam.  [He leans across the window's rightful owner, a bigger man than he, and opens his window.  MAN IN THE CORNER shrugs his shoulders and, quite sensibly, turns to his paper.]  MIRALDA  O, thank you so much.  JOHN  Don't mention it.  [Silence again.]  VOICES OF PORTERS [Off]  Fan Kar, Fan Kar.  [MAN IN THE CORNER gets out.]  MIRALDA  Could you tell me where this is?  JOHN  Yes. Elephant and Castle.  MIRALDA  Thank you so much. It was kind of you to protect me from that horrid man. He wanted to suffocate me.  JOHN  O, very glad to assist you, I'm sure. Very glad.  MIRALDA  I should have been afraid to have done it in spite of him. It was splendid of you.  JOHN  O, that was nothing.  MIRALDA  O, it was, really.  JOHN  Only too glad to help you in any little way.  MIRALDA  It was so kind of you.  JOHN  O, not at all.  [Silence for a bit.]  MIRALDA  I've nobody to help me.  JOHN  Er, er, haven't you really?  MIRALDA  No, nobody.  JOHN  I'd be very glad to help you in any little way.  MIRALDA  I wonder if you could advise me.  JOHN  I--I'd do my best.  MIRALDA  You see, I have nobody to advise me.  JOHN  No, of course not.  MIRALDA  I live with my aunt, and she doesn't understand. I've no father or mother.  JOHN  O, er, er, really?  MIRALDA  No. And an uncle died and he left me a hundred thousand pounds.  JOHN  Really?  MIRALDA  Yes. He didn't like me. I think he did it out of contrariness as much as anything. He was always like that to me.  JOHN  Was he? Was he really?  MIRALDA  Yes. It was invested at twenty-five per cent. He never liked me. Thought I was too--I don't know what.  JOHN  No.  MIRALDA  That was five years ago, and I've never got a penny of it.  JOHN  Really. But, but that's not right.  MIRALDA [sadly]  No.  JOHN  Where's it invested?  MIRALDA  In Al Shaldomir.  JOHN  Where's that?  MIRALDA  I don't quite know. I never was good at geography. I never quite knew where Persia ends.  JOHN  And what kind of an investment was it?  MIRALDA  There's a pass in some mountains that they can get camels over, and a huge toll is levied on everything that goes by; that is the custom of the tribe that lives there, and I believe the toll is regularly collected.  JOHN  And who gets it?  MIRALDA  The chief of the tribe. He is called Ben Hussein. But my uncle lent him all this money, and the toll on the camels was what they call the security. They always carry gold and turquoise, you know.  JOHN  Do they?  MIRALDA  Yes, they get it from the rivers.  JOHN  I see.  MIRALDA  It does seem a shame his not paying, doesn't it?  JOHN  A shame? I should think it is. An awful shame. Why, it's a crying shame. He ought to go to prison.  MIRALDA  Yes, he ought. But you see it's so hard to find him. It isn't as if it was this side of Persia. It's being on the other side that is such a pity. If only it was in a country like, like...  JOHN  I'd soon find him. I'd... Why, a man like that deserves anything.  MIRALDA  It is good of you to say that.  JOHN  Why, I'd... And you say you never got a penny?  MIRALDA  No.  JOHN  Well, that is a shame. I call that a downright shame.  MIRALDA  Now, what ought I to do?  JOHN  Do? Well, now, you know in business there's nothing like being on the spot. When you're on the spot you can--but then, of course, it's so far.  MIRALDA  It is, isn't it?  JOHN  Still, I think you should go if you could. If only I could offer to help you in any way, I would gladly, but of course...  MIRALDA  What would you do?  JOHN  I'd go and find that Hussein fellow; and then...  MIRALDA  Yes?  JOHN  Why, I'd tell him a bit about the law, and make him see that you didn't keep all that money that belonged to someone else.  MIRALDA  Would you really?  JOHN  Nothing would please me better.  MIRALDA  Would you really? Would you go all that way?  JOHN  It's just the sort of thing that I should like, apart from the crying shame. The man ought to be...  MIRALDA  We're getting into Holborn. Would you come and lunch somewhere with me and talk it over?  JOHN  Gladly. I'd be glad to help. I've got to see a man on business first. I've come up to see him. And then after that, after that there was something I wanted to do after that. I can't think what it was. But something I wanted to do after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1311"],["title","If: A Play in Four Acts (#3)"],["body","hat. O, heavens, what was it?  [Pause.]  MIRALDA  Can't you think?  JOHN  No. O, well, it can't have been so very important. And yet... Well, where shall we lunch?  MIRALDA  Gratzenheim's.  JOHN  Right. What time?  MIRALDA  One-thirty. Would that suit?  JOHN  Perfectly. I'd like to get a man like Hussein in prison. I'd like... O, I beg your pardon.  [He hurries to open the door. Exit MIRALDA.]  Now what was it I wanted to do afterwards?  [Throws hand to forehead.] O, never mind.  Curtain     ACT II  SCENE  JOHN's tent in Al Shaldomir. There are two heaps of idols, left and right, lying upon the ground inside the tent. DAOUD carries another idol in his arms. JOHN looks at its face.  Six months have elapsed since the scene in the second-class railway carriage.  JOHN BEAL  This god is holy.  [He points to the left heap. DAOUD carries it there and lays it on the heap.]  DAOUD  Yes, great master.  JOHN BEAL  You are in no wise to call me great master. Have not I said so? I am not your master. I am helping you people. I know better than you what you ought to do, because I am English. But that's all. I'm not your master, See?  DAOUD  Yes, great master.  JOHN BEAL  O, go and get some more idols. Hurry.  DAOUD  Great master, I go. [Exit.]  JOHN BEAL  I can't make these people out.  DAOUD [returning]  I have three gods.  JOHN BEAL [looking at their faces, pointing to the two smaller idols first] These two are holy. This one is unholy.  DAOUD  Yes, great master.  JOHN BEAL  Put them on the heap.  [DAOUD does so, two left, one right.]  Get some more.  [DAOUD salaams. Exit.]  [Looking at right heap.] What a--what a filthy people  [Enter DAOUD with two idols.]  JOHN BEAL [after scrutiny]  This god is holy, this is unholy.  [Enter ARCHIE BEAL, wearing a \"Bowler\" hat.]  Why, ARCHIE, this is splendid of you! You've come! Why, that's splendid! All that way!  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, I've come. Whatever are you doing?  JOHN BEAL  ARCHIE, it's grand of you to come! I never ought to have asked it of you, only...  ARCHIE BEAL  O, that's all right. But what in the world are you doing?  JOHN BEAL  ARCHIE, it's splendid of you.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, cut it. That's all right. But what's all this?  JOHN BEAL  O, this. Well, well they're the very oddest people here. It's a long story. But I wanted to tell you first how enormously grateful I am to you for coming.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, that's all right. But I want to know what you're doing with all these genuine antiques.  JOHN BEAL  Well, ARCHIE, the fact of it is they're a real odd lot of people here. I've learnt their language, more or less, but I don't think I quite understand them yet. A lot of them are Mahommedans; they worship Mahommed, you know. He's dead. But a lot of them worship these things, and...  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, what have you got 'em all in here for?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, that's just it. I hate interfering with them, but, well, I simply had to. You see there's two sorts of idols here; they offer fruit and rats to some of them; they lay them on their hands or their laps.  ARCHIE BEAL  Why do they offer them rats?  JOHN BEAL  O, I don't know. They don't know either. It's the right thing to do out here, it's been the right thing for hundreds of years; nobody exactly knows why. It's like the bows we have on evening shoes, or anything else. But it's all right.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, what are you putting them in heaps for?  JOHN BEAL  Because there's the other kind, the ones with wide mouths and rust round them.  ARCHIE BEAL  Rust? Yes, so there is. What do they do?  JOHN BEAL  They offer blood to them, ARCHIE. They pour it down their throats. Sometimes they kill people, sometimes they only bleed them. It depends how much blood the idol wants.  ARCHIE BEAL  How much blood it wants? Good Lord! How do they know?  JOHN BEAL  The priests tell them. Sometimes they fill them up to their necks--they're all hollow, you know. In spring it's awful.  ARCHIE BEAL  Why are they worse in spring?  JOHN BEAL  I don't know. The priests ask for more blood then. Much more. They say it always was so.  ARCHIE BEAL  And you're stopping it?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, I'm stopping these. One must. I'm letting them worship those. Of course, it's idolatry and all that kind of thing, but I don't like interfering short of actual murder.  ARCHIE BEAL  And they're obeying you?  JOHN BEAL  'M, y-yes. I think so.  ARCHIE BEAL  You must have got a great hold over them.  JOHN BEAL  Well, I don't know about that. It's the pass that counts.  ARCHIE BEAL  The pass?  JOHN BEAL  Yes, that place you came over. It's the only way anyone can get here.  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, I suppose it is. But how does the pass affect these idols?  JOHN BEAL  It affects everything here. If that pass were closed no living man would ever enter or leave, or even hear of, this country. It's absolutely cut off except for that one pass. Why, ARCHIE, it isn't even on the map.  ARCHIE BEAL  Yes, I know.  JOHN BEAL  Well, whoever owns that pass is everybody. No one else counts.  ARCHIE BEAL  And who does own it?  JOHN BEAL  Well, it's actually owned by a fellow called Hussein, but Miss Clement's uncle, a man called Hinnard, a kind of lonely explorer, seems to have come this way; and I think he understood what this pass is worth. Anyhow, he lent Hussein a big sum of money and got an acknowledgment from Hussein. Old Hinnard must have been a wonderfully shrewd man. For that acknowledgment is no more legal than an I.O.U., and Hussein is simply a brigand.  ARCHIE BEAL  Not very good security.  JOHN BEAL  Well, you're wrong there. Hussein himself respects that piece of parchment he signed. There's the name of some god or other written on it Hussein is frightened of. Now you see how things are. That pass is as holy as all the gods that there are in Al Shaldomir. Hussein possesses it. But he owes an enormous sum to Miss Miralda Clement, and I am here as her agent; and you've come to help me like a great sportsman.  ARCHIE BEAL  O, never mind that. Well, it all seems pretty simple.  JOHN BEAL  Well, I don't know, ARCHIE. Hussein admits the debt, but...  ARCHIE BEAL  But what?  JOHN BEAL  I don't know what he'll do.  ARCHIE BEAL  Wants watching, does he?  JOHN BEAL  Yes. And meanwhile I feel sort of responsible for all these silly people. Somebody's got to look after them. Daoud!  DAOUD [off]  Great master.  JOHN BEAL  Bring in some more gods.  DAOUD  Yes, great master.  JOHN BEAL  I can't get them to stop calling me absurd titles. They're so infernally Oriental.  [Enter DAOUD.]  ARCHIE BEAL  He's got two big ones this time.  JOHN BEAL [to ARCHIE]  You see, there is rust about their mouths. [To DAOUD]: They are both unholy.  [He points to R. heap, and DAOUD puts them there. To DAOUD.]  Bring in some more.  DAOUD  Great master, there are no more gods in Al Shaldomir.  JOHN BEAL  It is well.  DAOUD  What orders, great master.  JOHN BEAL  Listen. At night you shall come and take these gods away. These shall be worshipped again in their own place, these you shall cast into the great river and tell no man where you cast them.  DAOUD  Yes, great master.  JOHN BEAL  You will do this, Daoud?  DAOUD  Even so, great master.  JOHN BEAL  I am sorry to make you do it. You are sad that you have to do it. Yet it must be done.  DAOUD  Yes, I am sad, great master.  JOHN BEAL  But why are you sad, Daoud?  DAOUD  Great master, in times you do not know these gods were holy. In times you have not guessed. In old centuries, master, perhaps before the pass. Men have prayed to them, sorrowed before them, given offerings to them. The light of old hearths has shone on them, flames from old battles. The shadow of the mountains has fallen on them, so many times, master, so many times. Dawn and sunset have shone on them, master, like firelight flickering; dawn and sunset, dawn and sunset, flicker, flicker, flicker for century after century. They have sat there watching the dawns like old men by the fire. They are so old, master, so old. And some day dawn and sunset will die away and shine on the world no more, and they would have still sat on in the cold. And now they go... They are our history, master, they are our old times. Though they be bad times they are our times, master; and now they go. I am sad, master, when the old gods go.  JOHN BEAL  But they are bad gods, Daoud.  DAOUD  I am sad when the bad gods go.  JOHN BEAL  They must go, Daoud. See, there is no one watching. Take them now.  DAOUD  Even so, great master.  [He takes up the largest of the gods with rust.]  Come, Aho-oomlah, thou shalt not drink Nideesh.  JOHN BEAL  Was Nideesh to have been sacrificed?  DAOUD  He was to have been drunk by Aho-oomlah.  JOHN BEAL  Nideesh.  Who is he?  DAOUD  He is my son.  [Exit with Aho-oomlah. JOHN BEAL almost gasps.]  ARCHIE BEAL [who has been looking round the tent]  What has he been saying?  JOHN BEAL  They're--they're a strange people.  I can't make them out.  ARCHIE BEAL  Is that the heap that oughtn't to be worshipped?  JOHN BEAL  Yes.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, do you know, I'm going to chuck this hat there.  It doesn't seem to me somehow to be any more right here than those idols would be at home.  Odd isn't it?  Here goes.  [He throws hat on right heap of idols.  JOHN BEAL does not smile.]  Why, what's the matter?  JOHN BEAL  I don't like to see a decent Christian hat among these filthy idols.  They've all got rust on their mouths.  I don't like to see it, Archie; it's sort of like what they call an omen.  I don't like it.  ARCHIE BEAL  Do they keep malaria here?  JOHN BEAL  I don't think so.  Why?  ARCHIE BEAL  Then what's the matter, Johnny?  Your nerves are bad.  JOHN BEAL  You don't know these people, and I've brought you out here.  I feel kind of responsible. If Hussein's lot turn nasty you don't know what he'd do, with all those idols and all.  ARCHIE BEAL  He'll give 'em a drink, you mean.  JOHN BEAL  Don't, ARCHIE. There's no saying. And I feel responsible for you.  ARCHIE BEAL  Well, they can have my hat. It"]]]
