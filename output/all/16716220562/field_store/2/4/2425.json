Now I could have the pay roll department--we keep it as an entirely separate department here--turn up instantly the payments for the week in which that date occurs, but in order to separate that one day from the week, reference will have to be made to the Employment Bureau to find out what workers left, and how many were added, and the day of the week on which each of these left or began work in that week, and to add or to deduct such sums from the weekly pay roll.\"  \"That difficulty has come up several times,\" said Hamilton, \"because not many people pay their employees by the day. But in nine cases out of ten, an average for that week is usually struck, figuring in some cases by the days and in others by the hours. I suppose you noticed that the schedule itself states that what is sought is 'a normal day'?\"  \"I saw that,\" was the reply, \"but it seems to me that when possible it is better to have all the details carried out to the full. However, even that is not the most serious difficulty of these questions.\"  \"No,\" said Hamilton, \"that one hasn't given much trouble. The hitch usually comes just at the point you're looking at now--the cost of materials.\"  \"That's just exactly it. Our non-productive departments consume a great deal of material, mill-supplies and fuels, but if we include those with all the rest of it, our figures will not show a right proportion.\"  \"What do you mean by your non-productive departments?\" asked the boy. \"That seems rather a curious phrase.\"  \"Those in which the work done is not directly a part of the making of guns or ammunition. For example, we have a large force of draughtsmen working on new models of rifles and mechanisms and on machinery to enable us to make the new types. We make all the machinery that we use, right here in the plant. We make our own tools, too, so that there is a great deal of designing.\"  \"Those are not non-productive,\" commented Hamilton.  \"We call them so,\" was the reply.  \"I don't think the Census Bureau considers them as such,\" said Hamilton, feeling rather proud of this opportunity to explain some of the workings of the Bureau; \"it seems to me more satisfactory to consider that these works not only manufacture guns, rifles, and ammunition, but also machinery and tools.\"  \"But those are for our own use!\" objected the manager.  \"Yes, of course, I see that,\" said the boy. \"But even if you do use them yourselves, you make them yourselves. If you leave them out in the schedule it would make the figures all wrong.\"  \"How would it?\"  \"Well, the schedule wouldn't show anything paid out for machinery, and you've got to have machinery, and you'd seem to be paying wages, without getting anything for it. It seems to me that even if you do use the machinery yourselves you really sell it to yourselves, only at cost price or at whatever figure you name.\"  \"I suppose in a sense we do,\" said the business manager, \"but that seems a very roundabout way of getting at it.\"  \"I don't think it is,\" Hamilton replied. \"If you bought the machinery you would have to pay the manufacturer his profit. Instead of that you make the profit yourselves. The value, of course, should also be carried to the capital account.\"  \"Well,\" the older man said, \"I'm willing to put it down either way, and in that light these departments might be called productive, although not directly productive. You seem to have figured this sort of business out pretty well for a youngster,\" he added.  \"I suppose that's natural,\" Hamilton answered, \"because I've been doing nothing else for the past two weeks.\"  \"Then how about advertising,\" the manager suggested; \"perhaps you can tell me where that is usually listed? As part of the sales force?\"  \"No, sir,\" was the prompt reply; \"it is reported as a miscellaneous expense.\"  \"Very well,\" the official said, \"if you come back at four o'clock this afternoon I will have the schedule ready for you.\" Then, seeing that the boy hesitated, he said, \"Did you want it before then?\"  \"Oh, no, Mr. Arverne, thank you,\" the boy answered \"that wasn't what I had in mind at all. I was wondering whether, if I came back at three o'clock, I would be allowed to see something of the works. In quite a number of places I have been shown through the plant, sometimes because I had to get figures from managers of different departments, sometimes because I had a few minutes to spare while a clerk was filling up the schedule. But I've always been so interested in guns, and especially in Winchesters, that I really should like to find out how they're made.\"  The business manager shook his head dubiously.  \"We very rarely show any one over the plant,\" he said, \"because there is very little to be gained by it. And in any case, there are some portions of the works where visitors are never allowed, such as ammunition rooms where there are quantities of powder about, and similar places.\"  \"I'd like to be able to say that there was a desire on the part of the Census Bureau for a report,\" said Hamilton, \"but honestly I haven't the right to say so. I'm only asking as a favor. At the same time I have seen special reports on selected industries issued by the Bureau, and possibly my information might chance to be of value to the special agent who was getting it up.\"  \"Come back at two o'clock, then,\" said the manager. \"One of the members of the Board, Mr. Nebett, is here to-day, and if he has no objection I'll try to find some one to show you round.\"  Promptly at the appointed hour, Hamilton handed his card to the doorman, who showed him into a waiting-room. In a few minutes the door opened, and a keen-looking, well-set-up man appeared who came forward and held out his hand.  \"I've been hearing about you from Mr. Arverne,\" he said, \"and he tells me that you want to look over the works.\"  \"Mr. Nebett?\" queried the boy, and in response to an affirmative nod, he continued, \"Yes, sir, I'm very anxious to see part of it at any rate. I can see that it's a huge place, but gun-making must be so interesting that I'd like to see how it's done.\"  \"I think Mr. Arverne said something to me about your writing up a special report, a summary or something of that kind.\"  \"That was just a suggestion, Mr. Nebett,\" the boy replied. \"I told Mr. Arverne that the Census Bureau did issue special bulletins on selected industries, and that perhaps I might have an opportunity to make use of some information. But that's a personal idea of mine only, because most of those bulletins are written by experts in the Bureau.\"  \"Well,\" was the reply, \"I don't see that it can do us any harm, anyway, and if you are so interested you can come along with me. I like to go through the works every once in so often, and perhaps I can tell you more about these things than any other man in the place, because I get a chance to see it as a whole.\"  \"If you would,\" began the boy.  \"Come along, then,\" said the official, without further parley, and he led the way out of the general offices and across the street to the first of a huge group of buildings. Walking through the yard the two came presently to a long structure running alongside the railroad sidings. \"This,\" Hamilton was informed, \"is just the storeroom for raw material as it comes off the cars.\"  He turned half round as though to leave the building, but Hamilton stopped him with a question.  \"Steel, principally?\" he asked.  \"Steel.\"  \"What kind of steel?\" persisted Hamilton.  \"Oh, different kinds.\"  \"Why different kinds?\" continued the boy, working his eyebrows, as was his habit when in earnest. \"For different kinds of guns?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the older man, evidently deciding that he would have to go into the matter thoroughly with Hamilton, and passing on into the storehouse. \"We get mostly three kinds of steel, nickel steel, carbon steel, and soft steel, with a small proportion of other forms. We do that for the very reason you mentioned, that they are used for different kinds of work. Nickel steel we do not use for the cheaper grades of guns, because it is so much harder, and costs so much more to work. Indeed, very few gun-makers use nickel steel for barrels at all, but we do on all our high-grade work.\"  \"I notice,\" Hamilton said, \"that all the steel here is stored in bars and rods. Do you buy it that way, or have you a rolling mill in connection with the plant?\"  \"Buy it,\" the other said immediately. \"You can't run a rolling mill at a profit except on a large scale, and, anyway, this is too far from the source of supply. We get our copper in ingots, but not our steel.\"  \"I notice,\" the boy continued, fingering a long ticket attached to a bundle of steel rods by a wire, \"that you say here, 'Do not disturb until report from laboratory is received.'\"  \"Certainly,\" said the other, \"every order as it comes in is tested. We have two laboratories, a physical and a chemical, and not a scrap of material is used until it is found to be fully up to the specifications. There's no guesswork there, but the most rigid scientific tests. That keeps any poor material from slipping through.  \"Now,\" he continued, \"I'll show you what happens to those bars.\"  He led the way to a small building where the bars were cut into certain recognized lengths for the men at the drop forges to handle.  \"This forging shop,\" the manufacturer said, entering it as he spoke, \"is where most of the metal parts of the gun are first roughly shaped, and this man is working on part of a cartridge ejector. Watch him now,\" he went on, following the action of the workman; \"he takes a piece of steel out of the furnace behind him, lays it on the die, touches a lever, and the big drop-hammer comes down,--once, twice. He turns it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13183"],["title","In the Days of Chivalry: A Tale of the Times of the Black Prince (#0)"],["body","the Days of Chivalry  A Tale of the Times of the Black Prince  by Evelyn Everett-Green.        CHAPTER I. THE TWIN EAGLETS.   Autumn was upon the world -- the warm and gorgeous autumn of the south -- autumn that turned the leaves upon the trees to every hue of russet, scarlet, and gold, that transformed the dark solemn aisles of the trackless forests of Gascony into what might well have been palaces of fairy beauty, and covered the ground with a thick and soundless carpet of almost every hue of the rainbow.  The sun still retained much of its heat and power, and came slanting in between the huge trunks of the forest trees in broad shafts of quivering light. Overhead the soft wind from the west made a ceaseless, dreamy music and here and there the solemn silence of the forest was broken by the sweet note of some singing bird or the harsh croak of the raven. At night the savage cry of the wolf too often disturbed the rest of the scattered dwellers in that vast forest, and made a belated traveller look well to the sharpness of his weapons and the temper of his bowstring; but by day and in the sunlight the forest was beautiful and quiet enough -- something too quiet, perhaps, for the taste of the two handsome lads who were pacing the dim aisles together, their arms entwined and their curly heads in close proximity as they walked and talked.  The two lads were of exactly the same height, and bore a strong likeness one to the other. Their features were almost identical, but the colouring was different, so that no one who saw them in a good light would be likely to mistake or confuse them. Both had the oval face and delicate regular features which we English sometimes call \"foreign-looking;\" but then again they both possessed the broad shoulders, the noble height, the erect carriage, and frank, fearless bearing which has in it something distinctively English, and which had distinguished these lads from their infancy from the children of the country of their adoption. Then, though Raymond had the dark, liquid eyes of the south, Gaston's were as blue as the summer skies; and again, whilst Gaston's cheek was of a swarthy hue, Raymond's was as fair as that of an English maiden; and both had some golden gleams in their curly brown hair --- hair that clustered round their heads in a thick, waving mass, and gave a leonine look to the bold, eager faces. \"The lion cubs\" had been one of the many nicknames given to the brothers by the people round, who loved them, yet felt that they would not always keep them in their quiet forest. \"The twin eaglets\" was another such name; and truly there was something of the keen wildness of the eagle's eye in the flashing blue eyes of Gaston. The eager, delicate features and the slightly aquiline noses of the pair added, perhaps, to this resemblance; and there had been many whispers of late to the effect that the eaglets would not remain long in the nest now, but would spread their wings for a wider flight.  Born and bred though they had been at the mill in the great forest that covered almost the whole of the district of Sauveterre, they were no true children of the mill. What had scions of the great house of the De Brocas to do with a humble miller of Gascony? The boys were true sons of their house -- grafts of the parent stock. The Gascon peasants looked at them with pride, and murmured that the day would come when they would show the world the mettle of which they were made. Those were stirring times for Gascony -- when Gascony was a fief of the English Crown, sorely coveted by the French monarch, but tenaciously held on to by the \"Roy Outremer,\" as the great Edward was called; the King who, as was rumoured, was claiming as his own the whole realm of France. And Gascony, it must be remembered, did not in those days hold herself to be a part of France nor a part of the French monarchy. She held a much more important place than she would have done had she been a mere fief of the French Crown. She had a certain independence of her own -- her own language, her own laws, her own customs and she saw no humiliation in owning the sovereignty of England's King, since she bad passed under English rule through no act of conquest or aggression on England's part, but by the peaceful fashion of marriage, when nearly two centuries ago Eleanor of Aquitaine had brought to her lord, King Henry the Second, the fair lands of which Gascony formed a part. Gascony had grown and flourished apace since then, and was rich, prosperous, and content. Her lords knew how important she might be in days to come, when the inevitable struggle between the rival Kings of France and England should commence; and like an accomplished coquette, she made the most of her knowledge, and played her part well, watching her opportunity for demanding an increase of those rights and privileges of which she had not a few already.  But it was not of their country's position that the twin brothers were so eagerly talking as they wandered together along the woodland paths. It was little indeed that they knew of what was passing in the wide world that lay beyond their peaceful home, little that they heard of the strife of party or the suspicious jealousy of two powerful monarchs -- jealousy which must, as all long-sighted men well knew, break into open warfare before long. It was of matters nearer to their own hearts that the brothers spoke as they sauntered through the woodland paths together; and Gaston's blue eyes flashed fire as he paused and tossed back the tangled curls from his broad brow.  \"It is our birthright -- our land, our castle. Do they not all say that in old days it was a De Brocas, not a Navailles, that ruled there? Father Anselm hath told us a thousand times how the English King issued mandate after mandate bidding him give up his ill-gotten gains, and restore the lands of his rival; and yet he failed to do it. I trow had I been in the place of our grandsire, I would not so tamely have sat down beneath so great an affront. I would have fought to the last drop of my blood to enforce my rights, and win back my lost inheritance Brother, why should not thou and I do that one day? Canst thou be content for ever with this tame life with honest Jean and Margot at the mill? Are we the sons of peasants? Does their blood run in our veins? Raymond, thou art as old as I -- thou hast lived as long. Canst thou remember our dead mother? Canst thou remember her last charge to us?\"  Raymond had nodded his head at the first question; he nodded it again now, a glance of strange eagerness stealing into his dark eyes. Although the two youths wore the dress of peasant boys -- suits of undyed homespun only very slightly finer in make than was common in those parts -- they spoke the English tongue, and spoke it with purity and ease. It needed no trained eye to see that it was something more than peasant blood that ran in their veins, albeit the peasant race of Gascony in those days was perhaps the freest, the finest, the most independent in the whole civilized world.  \"I remember well,\" answered Raymond quickly; \"nay, what then?\"  \"What then? Spoke she not of a lost heritage which it behoved us to recover? Spoke she not of rights which the sons of the De Brocas had power to claim -- rights which the great Roy Outremer had given to them, and which it was for them to win back when the time should come? Dost thou remember? dost thou heed? And now that we are approaching to man's estate, shall we not think of these things? Shall we not be ready when the time comes?\"  Raymond gave a quick look at his brother. His own eyes were full of eager light, but he hesitated a moment before asking:  \"And thinkest thou, Gaston, that in speaking thus our mother would fain have had us strive to recover the castle and domain of Saut?\"  \"In good sooth yea,\" answered Gaston quickly. \"Was it not reft from our grandsire by force? Has it not been kept from him ever since by that hostile brood of Navailles, whom all men hate for their cruelty and oppression? Brother, have we not heard of dark and hideous deeds done in that same castle -- deeds that shame the very manhood of those that commit them, and make all honest folk curse them in their hearts? Raymond, thou and I have longed this many a day to sally forth to fight for the Holy Sepulchre against the Saracens; yet have we not a crusade here at home that calls us yet more nearly? Hast thou not thought of it, too, by day, and dreamed of it by night? To plant the De Brocas ensign above the walls of Saut -- that would indeed be a thing to live for. Methinks I see the banner already waving over the proud battlements.\"  Gaston's eyes flashed and glowed, and Raymond's caught an answering gleam, but still he hesitated awhile, and then said:  \"I fain would think that some day such a thing might be; but, Brother, he is a powerful and wily noble, and they say that he is high in favour with the Roy Outremer. What chance have two striplings like ourselves against so strong a foe? To take a castle, men must be found, and money likewise, and we have neither; and all men stand in deadly terror of the wrath of the Sieur de Navailles. Do they not keep even our name a secret from him, lest he should swoop down upon the mill with his armed retainers and carry us off thence -- so hates he the whole family that bears the name of De Brocas? What could we do against power such as his? I trow nothing. We should be but as pygmies before a giant.\"  Gaston's face had darkened. He could not gainsay his brother's reluctant words, but he chafed beneath them as a restive horse beneath the curb rein tightly drawn.  \"Yet our mother bid us watch and be ready. She spoke often of our lost inheritance, and she knew all the peril, the danger.\"  Raymond's eyes sought his brother's face. He looked like one striving to recall a dim and almost lost memory.  \"But thinkest thou, Gaston, that in thus speaking our mother was thinking of the strong fortress of "]]]
