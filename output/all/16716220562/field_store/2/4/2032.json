He will devote himself to thoughts of a revenge that shall be terrible enough to satisfy his wounded feelings.  You will do well to be on your guard.\"  Tom smiled as he replied:  \"Don Luis, I trust that I have seen the last of the fellow.\"  \"Be assured that you have not seen the last of him, Senor Tomaso.\"  \"Then it may go hard with Gato,\" smiled Tom, carelessly.  \"But I trust I have not offended you in this matter, Don Luis.  If I have, I am willing to withdraw, and I will reimburse you for the expense you have incurred in bringing us here.\"  \"I shall not let you go,\" smiled the Mexican, \"unless you feel that you no longer wish to remain in the same country with Pedro Gato.\"  \"That thought has not entered my mind, sir,\" Reade responded, almost stiffly.  \"Then we will say no more about the matter, and you will remain,\" nodded the Mexican.  \"And now we will go down into the mine and give you your first chance to examine our problems there.\"  As they entered the shaft house it was discovered that the elevator cage was at the foot of the shaft.  While they waited for the cage to come up, keen Dr. Tisco whispered to Tom:  \"Senor Reade, night and day you must be unceasingly on your guard against Gato.  In these mountains a hundred men will follow his beck and call.\"  \"If they are all like him, then Gato should turn bandit,\" laughed young Reade.  \"It is not unlikely that he will do so,\" sighed Tisco, with a slight shrug of his shoulders.  \"In Mexico, when a defeated man seeks blood revenge it is no uncommon thing for him to turn bandit until he has accomplished his hope of a terrible revenge.  Then, afterwards, if the bandit has annoyed the government enough, and has repeatedly escaped capture, the bandit makes his peace with the authorities and receives his pardon.\"  The cage arriving at this moment, the four men entered, and started downward.  Three hundred and sixty feet from the earth's surface Don Luis led them from the car into a tunnel.  \"I will now show you,\" promised Don Luis, \"something of the problem that confronts the engineers of this mine.\"  \"Keep your eyes open, and your wits about you, Harry,\" whispered Tom Reade.  \"I may be wholly wrong, yet, somehow, I can't quite rid myself of a notion that Don Luis wants us for some piece of rascally work, though of what kind I can't imagine.\"  \"I shall watch these two Gringos like a cat,\" reflected Dr. Tisco. \"I half suspect that they will foolishly sacrifice their lives sooner than serve us.\"     CHAPTER IV  TOM DOES SOME SAMPLING   At sight of Don Luis's party a Mexican foreman came running forward.  \"How runs the ore this morning?\" asked Don Luis.  \"Not quite as well as usual, excellency,\" replied the man, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"How!  Do you mean to tell me that the ore is running out for a streak!\"  \"Oh, no, excellency.  Yet it is the poorest ore that we have struck for a fortnight.  However, it will pay expenses and leave something for profit, too, excellency.\"  \"Show us what you have been doing,\" Don Luis directed.  Leading the way with a lantern that threw a brilliant light, the foreman went on down the tunnel to the heading.  As he neared the end of the tunnel the man called loudly and a number of workmen stepped aside.  As they reached the spot, Tom's quick eye saw that the morning's blasts had loosened some eight tons or so of ore.  Drillers stood ready to drive through the rock for the next blast.  \"Let us look at the ore, Senor Tomaso,\" suggested the mine owner.  Tom began to delve through the piles of shattered, reduced rock. The foreman held the lantern close, that the young engineer might have all the light he wanted, and called to miners to bring their lights closer.  Then Harry, also, began to examine the rock.  For some minutes the two young engineers picked up specimens and examined them.  \"What do you make of it?\" inquired Don Luis Montez at last.  \"Is this what you call a run of poor luck?\"  Tom asked the foreman, dryly.  \"Yes, senor; rather poor,\" answered the foreman.  \"Then it must be rather exciting here when the ore is running well,\" smiled Tom.  \"At a guess I should say that this 'poor' stuff before us will run thirty dollars to the ton.\"  \"It usually runs fifty, senor,\" broke in Don Luis.  \"Sometimes, for a run of a hundred tons, the ore will show up better than seventy-five dollars per ton.\"  \"Whew!\" whistled Reade.  \"Then no wonder you call this the land of golden promise.\"  \"By comparison it would make the mines in the United States look poor, would it not?\" laughed the mine owner.  \"There are very few mines there that show frequent runs of fifty dollars to the ton,\" Harry observed.  \"Are you going to clear out this ore, and send it to the dump\" Tom asked the foreman.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then I would be glad if you would do so at once,\" Tom remarked.  For answer the Mexican foreman stared at Tom in a rather puzzled way.  \"I will do so as soon as I am ordered,\" he responded, respectfully.  \"All right,\" returned Reade.  \"I'll give you the order.  Clear this stuff out and get it up in the ore cage.  Clear this tunnel floor with all the speed you comfortably can.\"  \"Perhaps the senor will explain?\" suggested the foreman.  \"These _caballeros_ are the new engineers in charge of the mine,\" said Dr. Tisco.  \"Ah!  So?  Then if Pedro Gato will only give the order--\" began the foreman.  \"If Pedro Gato gives you any orders,\" Tom suggested, briskly, \"you will ignore them.  Pedro Gato is no longer connected with the mine.\"  \"Not connected?\" gasped the foreman, who plainly doubted his ears.  \"No,\" broke in Don Luis.  \"You will take no more orders from Gato. These _caballeros_ are the engineers, and they are in charge.  You heard the order of Senor Reade.  You will clean out this tunnel, sending the ore above to the dump.\"  \"It shall be done,\" cried the foreman, bowing low before the mine owner.  \"And now, Senor Tomaso, if it suits you, we will go to another tunnel,\" proposed Don Luis.  \"Very good, sir,\" Tom assented.  \"What had been in my mind was to order the drillers at work here and see a blast made.\"  \"We can be back long before the next blast can be prepared,\" replied Montez.  \"Carlos, lead the way to tunnel number four.\"  The secretary turned, retracing his steps, Don Luis bringing up the rear.  \"Oho!  I have dropped my cigar case,\" remarked Don Luis a minute later.  \"I will go back and get it.\"  The others waited near the shaft.  Tom wondered, slightly, why Dr. Tisco had not volunteered to go back after his employer's missing cigar case.  Presently Don Luis appeared.  \"Now we will go to number four,\" he said.  The cage carried them to a lower level.  Here another foreman came forward to meet them and to conduct them to the heading.  Here were some five tons of rock.  Tom and Harry found it to be about the same grade of ore as that seen above.  \"Is this ore as good as you usually find in this vein?\"  Tom inquired of the second foreman.  \"Not quite, senor, though to-day's blasts have turned out to be very fair ore,\" responded the foreman.  \"I should say it is good ore,\" Tom remarked dryly.  \"Now, will you set the shovelers at work moving this stuff back a little way?  I want to see a new drilling made and watch the results of the blast.\"  \"If Pedro Gato--\" began the foreman, reluctantly.  \"Pedro Gato has nothing to do with this,\" Tom answered quickly. \"Mr. Hazelton and I are privileged to give such orders as we deem best.  Will you kindly tell the foreman so, Don Luis?\"  \"It is quite true,\" replied the mine owner.  \"Gato is no longer with us, and these gentlemen are in charge.\"  \"Then I will have the ore moved back at once,\" agreed the foreman.  \"But first we will go back out of the dirt and out of the danger from the blast,\" spoke Don Luis, using a good deal the tone of an order.  \"The rest of you may go back,\" suggested Reade.  \"But I wish to see the drilling done.\"  \"It is unnecessary, Senor Tomaso,\" smiled Don Luis, blandly. \"Come back with us.\"  \"I must see the men work, Don Luis, if I am to understand the work here,\" Tom rejoined, very quietly, though with a firmness that was wholly apparent.  \"Oh, very good then,\" smiled Montez, with a shrug of his shoulders.  Three of the inspecting party went back, but Tom remained close behind the drillers.  Twice he stopped them in their work, to collect small samples of the pulverized stuff that the drills turned back.  These specimens he placed in sample envelopes and stored in his pockets.  From the ore that was being shoveled back he chose other small specimens, labeling the envelopes in which he stored them.  By the time that the ore had been shoveled well back the drillers had completed their work.  Now the \"dope men\" came forward, putting the sticks of dynamite in place.  Tom watched them closely.  \"Do you call this last work well done?\"  Tom inquired of the foreman of the tunnel.  \"Yes, yes, senor, as well as I have been able to see,\" responded the Mexican.  \"Then come with me.  Just look at the tamping.  Hardly worthy of the name of tamping, is it?\"  Tom asked, poking at the material that had been forced in as tamping.  \"Senor, my men must have been indolent, this time,\" admitted the foreman.  \"Very indolent, or else indifferent,\" Tom smiled, grimly.  \"Here, you men, come here and let me show you how to set dynamite and tamp it.  Perhaps I do not understand the job very well, but we shall see.\"  Ten minutes later Tom Reade abandoned his work, rather well satisfied.  \"Now, when we fire the blasts, we shall move some rock, I believe,\" he smiled.  The wires were attached, and all hands went back, most of them going considerably to the rear of the man at the magneto battery.  A rocking explosion followed.  Tom was among the first to run forward. At the heading were heaps of rock.  \"Get in and pry it loose.  Shovel it back,\" Tom ordered, in Spanish.  Shortly after, Don Luis, Dr. Tisco"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#6)"],["body"," Harry appeared on the scene. They found Tom turning over the ore as it came back.  More than a dozen samples he dropped into envelopes, labeled them and put them away in his pockets.  \"What ails this lot of ore?\" inquired Harry, after looking at specimens.  \"It is not running as well,\" said Tom briefly.  \"Go through the stuff and see what you think of it.\"  \"But we have much more to see, _caballeros_,\" interposed Don Luis.  \"If you will be kind enough to indulge me here, for a few minutes more, I shall be grateful,\" Tom informed him.  \"Oh, very good,\" assented Don Luis, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"But it is not my purpose to tire you with too many observations on our first trip through the mine.\"  With a fine sample of Castillian courtesy and patience, Don Luis waited, smoking, until Reade had quite finished his inspection.  \"I am now at your service, Don Luis,\" announced the young chief engineer, rising and going toward his employer.  The remaining four tunnels of _El Sombrero_ Mine were visited. In each tunnel was the same pile of ore awaiting them, and it all looked good.  That in number three was the richest ore of all.  \"Now, I think we have seen enough for today,\" announced Don Luis, when they had inspected number three tunnel.  \"Then if you will go along and let me join you later, I shall appreciate it,\" Tom suggested politely.  \"You wish to linger?\" queried Don Luis, looking amused.  \"I wish to see a blast made here,\" Tom replied.  \"I, too, would like to see one,\" Harry added.  \"Then we will wait for you,\" agreed Don Luis, with a sigh that contained just a trace of impatience.  A drilling and a blast were made.  Again a lot of poor rock was loosened.  Tom and Harry collected specimens, labeling them.  \"Now, we will return to the house,\" said Don Luis.  \"I would really like to put in a long day here at the mine,\" proposed Reade, reluctantly.  \"To-morrow, then,\" nodded Don Luis.  \"But, for to-day, I am tired of this place.  There is much about which I wish to consult you, _caballeros_, at my office.\"  Tom glanced swiftly, covertly at Harry, then responded:  \"In that case, my dear Don Luis, we are wholly at your service.\"     CHAPTER V  THE MINE THAT DID AND DIDN'T   At the head of the shaft, Nicolas, the servant, awaited them.  \"Nicolas, you rascal!\" exclaimed Don Luis, angrily.  \"You have not been attending your _caballeros_.\"  \"Your pardon, excellency, but the automobile moved too swiftly for me,\" pleaded Nicolas.  \"All the way to the mine I ran, and here I have waited until now.\"  \"Keep pace with your duties hereafter, scoundrel,\" commanded Don Luis, angrily.  Nicolas stepped meekly to the rear of the party.  It was his business to attend Tom and Harry everywhere.  In Mexico one of the grade of gentleman, if he wishes only a glass of water, does not go for it; he sends the attending servant.  This time Nicolas slipped up on the front seat of the car beside the chauffeur.  The car traveled at a high rate of speed over the rough road.  \"It must cost you a mint of money for tires and repairs, not to speak of new cars,\" laughed Tom, after he had been bounced up two feet in the air as the automobile ran over a rough place in the road.  \"Pouf!  What does it matter, to a man who owns _El Sombrero_?\" smiled Don Luis Montez.  \"I am answered,\" Tom agreed.  \"The price of a few imported cars cannot matter much to you.\"  \"How many better mines than _El Sombrero_ have you seen?\" questioned the mine owner, leaning forward.  \"None,\" said Tom, promptly.  \"If all days' indications are as good as those of to-day,\" Harry added.  \"To-day has been but a poor day at the mine,\" murmured Dr. Tisco.  \"Then _El Sombrero_ is indeed a marvel,\" Tom declared.  \"It is a very rich mine,\" nodded Don Luis.  \"Yet there may be richer ones, in these mountains, yet undiscovered.\"  \"Where is the next best mine around here?\" Tom inquired.  \"Perhaps it is _El Padre_,\" murmured Don Luis, after a slight pause.  \"Where is _El Padre_ (the Priest) located?\" Tom wanted to know.  \"It is about four miles from here, up over that road,\" Don Luis rejoined, pointing out the direction.  \"May I ask if _El Padre_ is one of your properties, Don Luis?\" Tom continued.  \"No; why should I want it when I own _El Sombrero_?\"  \"Not unless you wish to own as many mines as possible.\"  \"_El Sombrero_ should be enough for my greatest dreams of wealth,\" declared Don Luis, closing his eyes dreamily.  Then the car stopped before the house.  Don Luis alighted, Tom and Harry at his heels.  A servant appeared at the entrance to the court and informed him that the midday meal was ready to serve.  \"We will go to the table, then,\" exclaimed the Mexican.  \"After having luncheon we shall be ready for an afternoon of hard work.\"  No sooner had the young engineers slipped into their seats at table than Nicolas appeared behind their chairs.  He served them gravely and without a word.  For nearly an hour the luncheon lasted.  Finally the dishes were cleared away and several boxes of cigars were brought.  Tom and Harry both declined them.  Dr. Tisco lighted a cigar at once; Don Luis spent much time in selecting his cigar.  This he lighted with the same deliberation.  At last the mine owner settled back in his seat.  \"_Caballeros_,\" he inquired, suddenly, \"what did you think of _El Sombrero_?\"  \"I would call it, Don Luis,\" Harry replied, with enthusiasm, \"the finest mine I have seen or heard of.\"  \"You did not see the best of the ore to-day,\" Montez assured them.  \"What ore we did see is as fine as any we would ever wish to see,\" Tom said.  \"Then you were delighted with the mine?\" inquired their host, turning to Reade and speaking more eagerly.  \"If the ore always runs as well,\" Tom rejoined, \"it ought to be one of the richest gold and silver properties in the world.\"  \"Pouf!  The ore usually runs much better--is worth much more than that which you saw to-day,\" protested Don Luis.  \"Then you are to be congratulated on possessing a treasure among mines,\" Tom commented.  \"I am delighted to hear you say that.\"  \"But when we adjourn to your office,\" Reade continued, \"there are a few questions that I shall want to ask you.\"  \"Why not ask them here, Senor Tomaso?\" queried Don Luis, in his purring, half affectionate voice.  \"Here at your table?\" protested Reade.  \"But this is not dinner.  This is a mere business luncheon,\" replied Don Luis, with another smile.  \"Yet I would like to discuss some of the samples with you, Don Luis,\" Tom explained.  \"Surely, you do not wish me to bring out dirty samples to spread on your fine linen.\"  \"It would matter not,\" declared the Mexican.  \"Still, if you have scruples about the proprieties, then we will go to the office within a few minutes.\"  The two who were smoking continued to do so.  Don Luis started to describe some of his experiments in raising Spanish mules. The finest mules that come out of Spain, class, in price, with blooded horses.  Don Luis talked with the enthusiasm of one who understood and loved mules.  Then, finally, they passed to the office.  \"Now, I shall be glad to talk with you for hours,\" the Mexican hidalgo assured the young engineers.  Dr. Tisco, as though to show that he took no personal interest in the talk, retired to an armchair at the further end of the room. Nevertheless, the secretary observed carefully all that was said. Covertly he studied the faces of the young engineers at all times.  \"Ask me what you will,\" begged Don Luis, as he sank into an easy chair close to the table on which Tom began to arrange his envelopes of specimens taken from the mine.  \"First of all, Don Luis,\" Tom began, \"you spoke of some problems that you wished us to solve in the operation of your mine.\"  \"Yes, Senor Tomaso.\"  \"I would like to ask you what the problems are that we are to consider,\" Tom announced.  \"Did you not see some of the problems before you, while we were going through the mine?\" inquired Montez.  \"At the risk, Don Luis, of appearing stupid, I must confess that I did not.\"  \"Ah, well, then we shall come to the problems presently.  You have other questions.  Ask some of them.\"  For a moment or two Reade studied what he had written on the various envelopes before him.  Then he picked out two.  \"Here, Don Luis,\" the young chief engineer went on, \"are samples of two lots of ore.  The first is from the pile that we found pried loose when we went into the first tunnel that we visited.  It is rich ore.\"  \"It is good enough ore,\" Montez replied, with a polite shrug of the shoulders.  \"Now, from the second tunnel that we entered, and where we also found a pile of loose ore, here is another sample.  It is as rich as the first sample.\"  \"Certainly, Senor Tomaso.\"  \"But in this second tunnel I had a drilling made and a blast fired. Here,\" picking up a third envelope and emptying it, \"is a sample of the ore that we saw taken from that blast.  If this sample contains any gold or silver the quantity is so small, evidently, as to render this kind of ore worthless.\"  \"Yes?\" murmured Don Luis, softly.  \"What is it that you have to say?\"  \"Why, sir, how does it happen that, right on top of such extra-fine ore we run upon blank rock at the very next blasting.\"  \"That sometimes happens in _El Sombrero_,\" Don Luis replied, smoothly,  \"How often has it happened?\" asked Tom, looking up from the table and glancing keenly at Don Luis.  Dr. Tisco, though he appeared to be almost asleep, stirred uneasily.  \"How often has it happened?\" repeated Don Luis.  \"Oh, perhaps a dozen times in a few months, taking all the tunnels together.\"  \"How long have these streaks of blank rock been?\" insisted Tom Reade, while Harry wondered at what his chum was driving.  \"How long?\" echoed Montez, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"Oh, how should I know?  Personally I am not interested in such things.\"  \"But have you gone as much as a whole week drilling and blasting through blank rock?\"  Tom pressed.  \"A week?  No; not for two days.  Of that I am certain.  But why do you"]]]
