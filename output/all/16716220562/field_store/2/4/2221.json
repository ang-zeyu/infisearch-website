As I remember, Mr. Browne was favorably disposed toward putting out a volume of Field's writings, but General McClurg was not enamoured of the breezy sort of personal persiflage with which Field's name was then chiefly associated. This was several years before Field made the Saints' and Sinners' Corner in McClurg's Chicago book-store famous throughout the bibliomaniac world by fictitious reports relating to it printed occasionally in his \"Sharps and Flats\" column. It was not until 1893 that McClurg & Co. published any of Field's writings.  My work to which Field refers was the collection of newspaper and periodical verse entitled \"The Humbler Poets,\" which McClurg & Co. subsequently published.  Enclosed in the letter of July 22d was the following characteristic account, conveying the impression that while he was willing to waste all the resources of his colored inks and literary ingenuity on our friendship, I must pay the freight. I think he had a superstition that it would cause a flaw in his title of \"The Good Knight, _sans peur et sans monnaie_\" if he were to add the price of a two-cent postage stamp to that waste.  [Illustration: A STAMP ACCOUNT.

His brow was cool and his breath was free,     And his hands were soft as a lady's hands,   And a song of the booming waves sang he     As he launched his bark from the golden sands.    The grayling chuckled a hoarse \"ha-ha,\"     And the Cisco tittered a rude \"he-he\"--   But the Thompson merrily sang \"tra-la\"     As his bark bounced over the Northern Sea._    II.    _A Thompson came bobbling back into the bay--     Back into the bay as the Sun sank low,   And the people knew there was hell to pay,     For HE wasn't the first who had come back so.    His nose was skinned and his spine was sore,     And the blisters speckled his hands so white--   He had lost his hat and had dropped an oar,     And his bosom-shirt was a sad sea sight.    And the grayling chuckled again \"ha-ha,\"     And the Cisco tittered a harsh \"ho-ho\"--   But the Thompson anchored furninst a bar     And called for a schooner to drown his woe._  During the fall of 1885 I was again sent East on some political work that took me to Saratoga and New York. As usual, Field was unremitting in his epistolary attentions with which I will not weary the reader. But on the journey back from New York they afforded entertainment and almost excited the commiseration of a young lady travelling home under my escort. When we reached Chicago I casually remarked that if she was so moved by Field's financial straits I would take pleasure in conveying as much truage to the impecunious knight as would provide him with buttered toast, coffee, and pie at Henrici's. She accordingly entrusted me with a quarter of a dollar, which I was to deliver with every assurance of her esteem and sympathy. As I was pledged not to reveal the donor's name, this tribute of silver provided Field with another character, whom he named \"The Fair Unknown,\" and to whom he indited several touching ballads, of which the first was:    _THE GOOD KNIGHT AND THE FAIR UNKNOWN    Now, once when this good knight was broke   And all his chattels were in soak,       The brave Sir Thompson came   And saith: \"I' faith accept this loan   Of silver from a fair unknown--       But do not ask her name!\"    The Good Knight dropped his wassail cup   And took the proffered bauble up,       And cautiously he bit   Its surface, but it would not yield,   Which did convince the grand old Field       It was not counterfeit.    Then quoth the Good Knight, as he wept:   \"Soothly this boon I must accept,       Else would I sore offend   The doer of this timely deed,   The nymph who would allay my need--       My fair but unknown friend.    \"But take to her, O gallant knight,   This signet with my solemn plight       To seek her presence straight,   When varlets or a caitiff crew   Resolved some evil deed to do--       Besiege her castle gate.    \"Then when her faithful squire shall bring   To him who sent this signet ring       Invoking aid of me--   Lo, by my faith, with this good sword   Will I disperse the base-born horde       And set the princess free!    \"And yet, Sir Thompson, if I send   This signet to my unknown friend,       I jeopardize my life;   For this fair signet which you see,   Odds bobs, doth not belong to me,       But to my brawny wife!    \"I should not risk so sweet a thing   As my salvation for a ring,       And all through jealous spite!   Haste to the fair unknown and say   You lost the ring upon the way--       Come, there's a courteous Knight!\"    Eftsoons he spake, the Good Knight drew   His visor down, and waving to       Sir Thompson fond farewell,   He leapt upon his courser fleet   And crossed the drawbridge to the street       Which was ycleped La Salle._  Another bit of verse was inspired by this incident which is worth preserving: One night I was dining at the house of a friend on the North Side where the \"Fair Unknown\" was one of the company--a fact of which Field only became possessed when I left the office late in the afternoon. The dinner had not progressed quite to the withdrawal of the ladies when, with some confusion, one of the waiting-men brought in and gave to me a large packet from the office marked \"Personal; deliver at once.\" Thinking it had something to do with work for the Morning News, I asked to be excused and hastily tore the enclosure open. One glance was enough to disclose its nature. It was a poem from Field, neatly arranged in the form of a pamphlet, with an illustration by Sclanders. The outside, which was in the form of a title page, ran thus:    HOW THE GOOD KNIGHT ATTENDED UPON SIR SLOSSON:    BEING A WOEFUL TALE   OF   THE MOST JOYOUS AND DIVERTING DAYS    WHEREIN    KNIGHTS ERRANT DID COURTEOUSLY   DISPORT THEMSELVES   AND ACHIEVE PRODIGIES OF VALOR,    AND    MARVELS OF SWEET FRIENDSHIP.  And inside the plaintive story was told in variegated ink in the following lines:    _One chilly raw November night   Beneath a dull electric light,         At half-past ten o'clock,   The Good Knight, wan and hungry, stood,   And in a half-expectant mood         Peered up and down the block.    The smell of viands floated by   The Good Knight from a basement nigh         And tantalized his soul.   Keenly his classic, knightly nose   Envied the fragrance that arose         From many a steaming bowl.    Pining for stews not brewed for him,   The Good Knight stood there gaunt and grim--         A paragon of woe;   And muttered in a chiding tone,   \"Odds bobs! Sir Slosson must have known         'Twas going to rain or snow!\"    But while the Good and Honest Knight   Flocked by himself in sorry plight,         Sir Slosson did regale   Himself within a castle grand--   of the Good Knight and         His wonted stoup of ale.    Mid joyous knights and ladies fair   He little recked the evening air         Blew bitterly without;   Heedless of pelting storms that came   To drench his friend's dyspeptic frame,         He joined the merry rout.    But underneath the corner light   Lingered the impecunious Knight--         Wet, hungry and alone--   Hoping that from Sir Slosson some   Encouragement mayhap would come,         Or from the Fair Unknown._  The drawing in this verse marks the beginning of the transfer of our patronage from the steaks and gamblers' frowns of Billy Boyle's to the oysters and the cricket's friendly chirps of the Boston Oyster House. The reference to Field's \"dyspeptic frame\" is not without its significance, for it was about this time that he became increasingly conscious of that weakness of the stomach that grew upon him and began to give him serious concern.  How Field seized upon my absence from the city for the briefest visit to bombard me with queer and fanciful letters, found another illustration during Christmas week, 1885, which I spent with a house party at Blair Lodge, the home of Walter Cranston Larned, whom I have already mentioned as the possessor of Field's two masterpieces in color. Each day of my stay was enlivened by a letter from Field. As they are admirable specimens of the wonderful pains he took with letters of this sort, and the expertness he attained in the command of the archaic form of English, I need no excuse for introducing them here. The first, which bears date \"December 27th, 1385,\" was written on an imitation sheet of old letter paper, browned with dirt and ragged edged. In the order of receipt these letters were as follows:    Soothly, sweet Sir, by thy hegira am I brought into sore distress and   grievous discomfiture; for not only doth that austere man, Sir   Melville, make me to perform prodigies of literary prowess, but all   the other knights do laugh me to scorn and entreat me shamelessly   when I be an hungered and do importune them for pelf whereby I may   compass victual. Aye, marry, by my faith, I swear't, it hath gone ill   with me since you strode from my castle in the direction of the   province wherein doth dwell Sir Walter, the Knight of the Tennis and   Toboggan. I beseech thee to hie presently unto me, or at least to   send silver or gold wherewith I may procure cheer--else will it go   hard with me, mayhap I shall die, in which event I do hereby name and   constitute thee executor of my estates and I do call upon the saints   in heaven to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#8)"],["body","the solemn instrument. Verily, good Sir, I do   grievously miss thee and I do pine for thy joyous discourse and   triumphant cheer, nor, by my blade, shall I be content until once   more thou art come to keep me company.    Touching that varlet Knight, Sir Frank de Dock, I have naught to say,   save and excepting only that he be a caitiff and base-born dotard   that did deride me and steal away unto his castle this very night   when I did supplicate him to regale me with goodly viands around the   board of that noble host, the gracious Sir Wralsy of Murdough. I   would to heaven a murrain would seize the hearts of all such craven   caitiffs who hath not in them the sweet courtesy and generous   hospitality that doth so well become thee, O glorious and   ever-to-be-mulcted Sir Knight of the well-stored wallet. I do beseech   thee to have a care to spread about in the province wherein thou dost   sojourn a fair report of my gentleness and valor. Commend me to the   glorious and triumphant ladies and privily advise them to send me   hence guerdons of gold or silver if haply they are tormented by base   enchanters, cruel dragons, vile hippogriffins, or other untoward   monsters, and I do swear to redress their wrongs when those guerdons   do come unto me. For it doth delight me beyond all else to avenge   foul insults heaped upon princesses and lorn maidens. If so be thou   dost behold that incomparable pearl of female beauty and virtue, the   Fair Unknown, prithee kiss thou her bejewelled hand for me and by thy   invincible blade renew my allegiance unto her sweet cause. Methinks   her sunny locks and azure orbs do haunt my dreams, and anon I hear   her silvery tones supplicating me to accept another arms. And I do   lustily beshrew fate that these be but dreams.    Now in very sooth do I pray ye may speedily come unto me. Or if you   abide in that far-off province, heaven grant ye prosperity and   happiness such as surely cannot befall the Good Knight till thou dost   uplift his arms again.    I do supplicate thee to make obeisance unto all in my name and to   send hither tidings of thy well-being. How goeth the jousts and   tourneys with the toboggan, and hath the cyclonic Sir Barbour wrought   much havoc with his perennial rhetoric in the midst of thee? I do   kiss thy hand and subscribe myself,    Thy sweet and sorry slave,    THE GOOD KNIGHT.  All of this exercise in the phraseology of chivalry was written on a single sheet of note-paper with such generous margins that the text only covered a space of two and one-half by four inches on each page. Next day I received the second of this knightly series:    While I addressed thee fair and subtile words on yester even, O   sweet and incomparable knight! there did enter into my presence a   base enchanter who did evilly enchant and bewitch me, making me to   do dire offence unto the mother tongue. Soothly this base born   enchanter did cause me to write \"arms,\" when soothly I did mean an   \"alms,\" and sore grievousness be come upon me lest haply thou dost   not understand this matter ere this missive reach thee. I do beseech   thee have a care to tell the fair princesses and glorious ladies   that I am in very truth a courteous knight and learned eke, and that   I shall neither taste food nor wine until I have slain the evil   enchanter that did so foully bewitch me. Odds bobs, I trow it was   that varlet dotard, Sir Frank de Dock, who hath entreated me most   naughtily since thou art departed unto that far-off province. By   this courier do I dispatch certain papers of state unto thee, and   faith would I have dispatched thy wages eke, but that caitiff   in minion, Sir Shekelsford, did taunt and revile me when I did   supplicate him to give up.    The incomparable Sir Melville hath all the good knights writing   editorials this eve, from the hoary and senile Dock down to the   knavish squire that sweeps out the castle.    May peace bide with thee in thy waking hours and brood o'er thy   slumbers, good gentle sir, and may heaven speed the day when in fair   health and well-walleted thou shalt return unto    Thy pining and sweet slave,    THE GOOD KNIGHT.   December 28th, 1885.  Before another day elapsed I received the third, and, in some respects, most interesting of this series, addressed to me by my knightly title at \"Blair Lodge Castle, Lake Forest,\" which is less than thirty miles from Chicago:    Joyous and merry knight:--Soothly I wot this be the last message you   shall have from me ere you be come again hence, since else than the   stamp hereupon attached have I none nor ween I whence another can be   gotten. By the bright brow of Saint Aelfrida, this is a sorry world,   and misery and vexation do hedge us round about! A letter did this   day come unto the joyous and buxom wench, the lady Augusta, wherein   did Sir Ballantyne write how that he did not believe that the poem   \"Thine Eyes\" was printed in Sir Slosson's book. Now by St. Dunstan!   right merrily will he rail when so he learneth the whole truth.   Sir Melville hath not yet crossed the drawbridge of the castle,   albeit it lacketh now but the length of a barleycorn till the tenth   hour. Sir Frank de Dock hath hied him home for he is truly a senile   varlet and when I did supplicate him to regale me with a pasty this   night he quoth, \"Out upon thee, thou scurvy leech!\" \"Beshrew   thyself, thou hoary dotard!\" quoth I, nor tarried I in his presence   the saying of a pater noster, but departing hence did sup with that   lusty blade, Sir Paul of Hull, and verily he did regale me as well   beseemeth a good knight and a gentle eke.    Now, by my sword I swear't, all this venal and base-born rabble   shall rue their folly when thou art returned, O nonpareil of all the   brave and hospitable! I pray thee bring rich booty from that   province wherein thou dost now tarry--crowns, derniers, livres,   ducats, golden angels, and farthings. Then soothly shall we make   merry o'er butts of good October brewing. Commend me to the discreet   and beauteous ladies after the manner of that country, for I have   heard their virtues highly praised, it being said that they do sing   well, play the lute and spinet and work fair marvels with the   needle. I do beseech thee bespeak me fair unto the grand seneschal,   Sir Barbour, and thy joyous and courteous host, Sir Walter. In sooth   it is a devilry how I do miss you. Thy friend and slave in sweetness   and humility,    THE GOOD KNIGHT.   December 29th, 1885.     CHAPTER IV  MORE LETTERS   In the fall and winter of 1885-86 I succeeded in inducing Field to take the only form of exercise he was ever known voluntarily to indulge. While his column of \"Sharps and Flats\" to the end bore almost daily testimony to his enthusiastic devotion to the national game and of his critical familiarity with its fine points and leading exponents, he was never known to bat or throw a ball. He never wearied of singing the praises in prose and verse of Michael J. Kelly, who for many years was the star of the celebrated \"White Stockings\" of Chicago when it won the National League pennant year after year. Nor did he cease to revile the Chicago base-ball management when it transferred \"King Kel\" to the Boston club for the then unheard-of premium of $10,000. When the base-ball season was at its height his column would bristle with the proofs of his vivid interest in it. I have known it on one day to contain over a score of paragraphs relating to the national game, encouraging the home nine or lampooning the rival club with all the personal vivacity of a sporting reporter writing for a country weekly. Interspersed among these notes would be many an odorous comparison like this, printed June 28th, 1888:    Benjamin Harrison is a good, honest, patriotic man, and we like him.   But he never stole second base in all his life and he could not swat   Mickey Welch's down curves over the left-field fence. Therefore we   say again, as we have said many times before, that much as we revere   Benjamin Harrison's purity and amiability, we cannot but accord the   tribute of our sincerest admiration, to that paragon of American   manhood, Michael J. Kelly.  So when Kelly essayed to change the scene of his labors from the diamond to the melodramatic stage in 1893 it is not surprising to find that Field, in a semi-humorous and semi-serious vein, thus applauded and approved his choice:    Surprise is expressed in certain quarters because Mike Kelly, the   base-ball virtuoso, has made a hit upon the dramatic stage. The   error into which many people have fallen is in supposing that Kelly   was simply a clever base-ball machine. He is very much more than   this: he is an unusually bright and intelligent man. As a class,   base-ball professionals are either dull brutes or ribald brutes;   ignorance as dense as Egyptian darkness has seemed to constitute one   of the essentials to successful base-ball playing, and the average   professional occupies an intellectual plane hardly above that of the   average stall-fed ox or the fat pig at a country fair. Mike Kelly   stands pre-eminent in his profession; no other base-ball player   approaches him. He is in every way qualified for a better career   than that which is bounded on one side by the bleaching boards, and   on the other by the bar-room. Of course he is a good actor. He is   too smart to attempt anything at which he does not excel.  But I have been diverted from telling of the sport in which Field was an active participant by the recollection of his critical and literary expertness in the great game in which he never took an active part. Once when Melville Stone was asked what was his dearest wish at that instant, he replied, \"to beat Field and Thompson bowling.\" This was in the days before bowling was the fashionable winter sport it has since become. The alleys in Chicago in 1885 were neither numerous nor in first-class condition; but after Field once "]]]
