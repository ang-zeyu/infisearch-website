The legend of Idunn is told by Thjodulf much as Snorri tells it: Odin, Hoeni and Loki, while on a journey, kill and roast an ox. The giant Thiazi swoops down in eagle's shape and demands a share; Loki strikes the eagle, who flies off with him, releasing him only on condition that he will betray to the giants Idunn, \"the care-healing maid who understands the renewal of youth.\" He does so, and the Gods, who grow old and withered for want of her apples, force him to go and bring her back to Asgard.  The poet of _Eiriksmal_, quoted above, alludes to the Baldr myth: Bragi, hearing the approach of Eirik and his host, asks \"What is that thundering and tramping, as if Baldr were coming back to Odin's hall?\" The funeral pyre of Baldr is described by Ulf Uggason: he is burnt on his ship, which is launched by a giantess, in the presence of Frey, Heimdal, Odin and the Valkyries.  Though heathen writers outside of Scandinavia are lacking, references to Germanic heathendom fortunately survive in several Continental Christian historians of earlier date than any of our Scandinavian sources. The evidence of these, though scanty, is corroborative, and the allusions are in striking agreement with the Edda stories in tone and character.  Odin (Wodanus) is always identified by these writers with the Roman Mercurius (whom Tacitus named as the chief German God). This identification occurs in the eighth-century Paulus Diaconus, and in Jonas of Bobbio (first half of the seventh century), and probably rests on Odin's character as a wandering God (Mercury being diaktoros), his disguises, and his patronage of poetry and eloquence (as Mercury is logios). Odin is not himself in general the conductor of dead souls (psychopompos), like the Roman God, his attendant Valkyries performing the office for him. The equation is only comprehensible on the presumption of the independence of Germanic mythology, and cannot be explained by transmission. For if Odin were in any degree an imitation of the Roman deity, other notable attributes of the latter would have been assigned to him: whereas in the Edda the thieving God (kleptis) is not Odin but Loki, and the founder of civilisation is Heimdal.  The legend of the origin of the Lombards given by Paulus Diaconus illustrates the relations of Odin and Frigg. The Vandals asked Wodan (Odin) to grant them victory over the Vinili; the latter made a similar prayer to Frea (Frigg), the wife of Wodan. She advised them to make their wives tie their hair round their faces like beards, and go with them to meet Wodan in the morning. They did so, and Wodan exclaimed, \"Who are these _Long-beards_?\" Then Frea said that having given the Vinili a name, he must give them the victory (as Helgi in the Edda claims a gift from Svava when she names him). As in _Grimnismal_, Odin and Frigg are represented as supporting rival claims, and Frigg gains the day for her favourites by superior cunning. This legend also shows Odin as the giver of victory.  Few heathen legends are told however by these early Christian writers, and the Gods are seldom called by their German names. An exception is the Frisian Fosite mentioned by Alcuin (who died 804) and by later writers; he is to be identified with the Norse Forseti, the son of (probably at first an epithet of) Baldr, but no legend of him is told. It is disappointing that these writers should have said so little of any God except the chief one. A very characteristic touch survives in Gregory of Tours (died 594), when the Frank Chlodvig tells his Christian wife that the Christian God \"cannot be proved to be of the race of the Gods,\" an idea entirely in keeping with the Eddic hierarchy. Before leaving the Continental historians, reference may be made to the abundant evidence of Germanic tree-worship to be gathered from them. The holy oak mentioned by Wilibald (before 786), the sacred pear-tree of Constantius (473), with numerous others, supply parallels to the World-Ash which is so important a feature of Norse mythology.  A study of this subject would be incomplete without some reference to the mythology of Saxo Grammaticus. His testimony on the old religion is unwilling, and his effort to discredit it very evident. The bitterness of his attack on Frigg especially suggests that she was, among the Northmen, a formidable rival to the Virgin. When he repeats a legend of the Gods, he transforms them into mortal heroes, and when, as often happens, he refers to them accidentally as Gods, he invariably hastens to protest that he does so only because it had been the custom. He describes Thor and Odin as men versed in sorcery who claimed the rank of Gods; and in another passage he speaks of the latter as a king who had his seat at Upsala, and who was falsely credited with divinity throughout Europe. His description of Odin agrees with that in the Edda: an old man of great stature and mighty in battle, one-eyed, wearing a great cloak, and constantly wandering about in disguise. The story which Saxo tells of his driving into battle with Harald War-tooth, disguised as the latter's charioteer Brun, and turning the fight against him by revealing to his enemy Ring the order of battle which he had invented for Harald's advantage, is in thorough agreement with the traditional character of the God who betrayed Sigmund the Volsung and Helgi Hundingsbane. Saxo's version of the Baldr story has been mentioned already. Baldr's transformation into a hero (who could only be slain by a sword in the keeping of a wood-satyr) is almost complete. But Odin and Thor and all the Gods fight for him against his rival Hother, \"so that it might be called a battle of Gods against men\"; and Nanna's excuse to Baldr that \"a God could not wed with a mortal,\" preserves a trace of his origin. The chained Loki appears in Saxo as Utgarda-Loki, lying bound in a cavern of snakes, and worshipped as a God by the Danish king Gorm Haraldsson. Dr. Eydberg sees the Freyja myth in Saxo's story of Syritha, who was carried away by the giants and delivered by her lover Othar (the Od of the Edda): an example, like _Svipdag and Menglad_, of the complete transformation of a divine into an heroic myth. In almost all cases Saxo vulgarises the stories in the telling, a common result when a mythical tale is retold by a Christian writer, though it is still more conspicuous in his versions of the heroic legends.      Appendix   _Thrymskvida_.  1. Then Wing-Thor was angry when he awoke, and missed his hammer. He shook his beard, he tossed his hair, the son of Earth groped about for it.  2. And first of all he spoke these words: \"Hear now, Loki, what I tell thee, a thing that no one in earth or heaven above has heard: the Asa has been robbed of his hammer!\"  3. They went to the dwelling of fair Freyja, and these words he spoke first of all: \"Wilt thou lend me, Freyja, thy feather dress, to see if I can find my hammer?\"  4. _Freyja_. \"I would give it thee, though it were of gold; I would grant it, though it were of silver.\"  5. Then Loki flew, the feather-coat rustled, until he came out of Asgard and into Jötunheim.  6. Thrym, lord of the Giants, sat on a howe; he twisted golden bands for his greyhounds and trimmed his horses' manes.  7. _Thrym_. \"How is it with the Aesir? How is it with the Elves? Why art thou come alone into Jötunheim?\"  _Loki_. \"It is ill with the Aesir, it is ill with the Elves; hast thou hidden the Thunderer's hammer?\"  8. _Thrym_. \"I have hidden the Thunderer's hammer eight miles below the earth. No man shall bring it back, unless he bring me Freyja to wife.\"  9. Then Loki flew, the feather-coat rustled, until he came out of Jötunheim and into Asgard. Thor met him in the middle of the court, and these words he spoke first:  10. \"Hast thou news in proportion to thy toil? Tell me from on high thy distant tidings, for a sitting man often breaks down in his story, and he who lies down falls into falsehood.\"  11. _Loki_. \"I bring news for my toil: Thrym, lord of the Giants, has thy hammer; no man shall bring it back, unless he take him Freyja as a bride.\"  12. They went to see fair Freyja, spoke to her first of all these words: \"Bind on the bridal veil, Freyja, we two must drive to Jötunheim.\"  13. Angry then was Freyja; she panted, so that all the hall of the Aesir trembled, and the great Brising necklace fell: \"Eager indeed for marriage wouldst thou think me, if I should drive with thee to Jötunheim.\"  14. Then all the Aesir went into council, and all the Asynjor to consultation, and the mighty Gods discussed how they should recover the Thunderer's hammer.  15. Then spoke Heimdal, whitest of the Aesir; he could see into the future like the Vanir: \"Let us bind on Thor the bridal veil; let him have the great necklace Brising.  16. \"Let the keys jingle, and let women's weeds fall about his knees; let us put broad stones on his breast, and a hood dexterously on his head.\"  17. Then spoke Thor, the mighty Asa: \"Vile would the Aesir call me, if I let the bridal veil be bound on me.\"  18. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: \"Speak not such words, Thor! soon will the Giants dwell in Asgard, unless thou bring home thy hammer.\"  19. Then they bound on Thor the bridal veil, and the great necklace Brising; they let the keys jingle and women's weeds fall about his knees, and they put broad stones on his breast, and the hood dexterously on his head.  20. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: \"I also will go with thee as thy maiden; we two will drive together to Jötunheim.\"  21. Then the goats were driven out, urged forward in their harness; well must they run. Rocks were riven, the earth burned in name: Odin's son was driving into Jötunheim.  22. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Stand up, giants, and strew the benches!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13007"],["title","The Edda, Volume 1 (#6)"],["body"," They are bringing me now Freyja my bride, Njörd's daughter from Noatun.  23. \"Gold-horned kine run in the court, oxen all-black, the giant's delight. I have many treasures, I have many jewels, Freyja only is lacking.\"  24. The guests assembled early in the evening, and ale was carried to the Giants. One ox did Sif's husband eat, and eight salmon, and all the dishes prepared for the women; three casks of mead he drank.  25. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Who ever saw a bride eat so eagerly? I never saw a bride make such a hearty meal, nor a maid drink so deep of mead.\"  26. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's words: \"Eight nights has Freyja eaten nothing, so eager was she to be in Jötunheim.\"  27. He looked under the veil, he longed to kiss the bride, but he started back the length of the hall: \"Why are Freyja's eyes so terrible? Fire seems to burn from her eyes.\"  28. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's speech: \"Eight nights has Freyja had no sleep, so eager was she to be in Jötunheim.\"  29. In came the Giants' wretched sister, she dared to ask for a bridal gift: \"Take from thine arms the red rings, if thou wouldst gain my love, my love and all my favour.\"  30. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Bring the hammer to hallow the bride. Lay Mjöllni on the maiden's knee, hallow us two in wedlock.\"  31. The Thunderer's heart laughed in his breast, when the bold of soul felt the hammer. Thrym killed he first, the lord of the Giants, and all the race of the Giants he struck.  32. He slew the Giants' aged sister, who had asked him for a bridal gift. She got a blow instead of shillings, and a stroke of the hammer for abundance of rings. So Odin's son got back his hammer.    Bibliography   I. Study in the Original.  (1) _Poetic Edda_.--The classic edition, and on the whole the best, is Professor Bugge's (Christiania, 1867); the smaller editions of Hildebrand (_Die Lieder der Aelteren Edda_, Paderborn, 1876), and Finnur Jónsson (_Eddalieder_, Halle, 1888-90) are also good; the latter is in two parts, _Göttersage_ and _Heldensage_. The poems may also be found in the first volume of Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_ (Oxford, 1883), accompanied by translations; but in many cases they are cut up and rearranged, and they suffer metrically from the system adopted of printing two short lines as one long one, with no dividing point. There is an excellent palaeographic edition of the _Codex Regius of the Elder Edda_, by Wimmer and Finnur Jónsson (Copenhagen, 1891), with photographic reproductions interleaved with a literal transcription.  (2) _Snorra Edda_.--The most recent edition of the whole is Dr. Finnur Jónsson's (Copenhagen, 1875). There is a useful edition of the mythological portions _(i.e., Gylfaginning, Bragaraedur_, and the narrative parts of _Skaldskaparmal_) by Ernst Wilken (_Die Prosäische Edda_, Paderborn, 1878).  (3) _Dictionaries and Grammars_.--For the study of the Poetic Edda, Gering's _Glossar zu den Liedern der Edda_ (Paderborn, 1896) will be found most useful; it is complete and trustworthy, and in small compass. A similar service has been performed for _Snorra Edda_ in Wilken's _Glossar_ (Paderborn, 1883), which forms a second volume to his edition, mentioned above. Both are, of course, in German. The only English dictionary is the lexicon of Cleasby and Vigfusson (Oxford).  Of Grammars, the best are German; those of Noreen (_Altnordische Grammatik_, Halle, 1892), of which there is an abbreviated edition, and Kahle (_Altisländisches Elementarbuch_, Heidelberg, 1896) being better suited for advanced students; the English grammars included in Vigfusson and Powell's _Icelandic Reader_ (Oxford) and Sweet's _Icelandic Primer_ (Oxford) are more elementary, and therefore hardly adequate for the study of the verse literature.   II. Translations.  There are English translations of the Elder Edda by Anderson (Chicago, 1879) and Thorpe (1866), as well as the translations in the _Corpus Poeticum_, which are, of course, liable to the same objection as the text. The most accurate German translation is Gering's (Leipzig, 1893); in Simrock's (_Aeltere und Jüngere Edda_, Stuttgart, 1882), the translations of the verse Edda are based on an uncritical text. Snorra Edda was translated into English by Dasent (Stockholm, 1842); also by Anderson (Chicago, 1880).   III. Modern Authorities.  To the works on Northern mythology mentioned below in the note on the Baldr theories, must be added Dr. Rydberg's _Teutonic Mythology_ (English version by R.B. Anderson, London, 1889), which devotes special attention to Saxo.    Notes  _Home of the Edda_. (Page 2.)  The chief apologists for the British theory are Professor Bugge (_Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen_, München, 1889), and the editors of the _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_ (see the Introduction to that  work, and also the Prolegomena prefixed to their edition of the _Sturlunga Saga_, Oxford). The case for Norway and Greenland is argued by Dr. Finnur Jónsson (_Den oldnorsk og oldislandske Literaturs-Historie,_ Copenhagen). The cases for both British and Norwegian origin are based chiefly on rather fanciful arguments from supposed local colour. The theory of the _Corpus Poeticum_ editors that many of the poems were composed in the Scottish isles is discredited by the absence of Gaelic words or traces of Gaelic legend. Professor Bugge's North of England theory is slightly stronger, being supported by several Old English expressions in the poems, but these are not enough to prove that they were composed in England, since most Icelanders travelled east at some time of their lives.  (Page 3.)  A later study will deal with the Heroic legends.  _Ynglinga Saga_. (Page 3.)  _Ynglinga Saga_ is prefixed to the Lives of the Kings in the collection known as _Heimskringla_ (edited by Unger, Christiania, 1868, and by Finnur Jónsson, Christiania, 1893); there is an English translation in Laing's _Lives of the Kings of Norway_ (London, 1889).  _Völuspa_. (Page 4.)  A poem of similar form occurs among the heroic poems. _Gripisspa_, a prophetic outline of Sigurd's life, introduces the Volsung poems, as _Völuspa_ does the Asgard cycle.  _Riddle-poems_. (Page 6.)  So many of the mythological poems are in this form that they suggest the question, did the asking of riddles form any part of Scandinavian ritual?  _The Aesir_. (Page 11.)  _Ynglinga Saga_ says that Odin and the Aesir came to Norway from Asia; a statement due, of course, to a false etymology, though theories as to the origin of Norse mythology have been based on it.  _Tyr_. (Page 12.)  Tyr is etymologically identical with Zeus, and with the Sanskrit Dyaus (Sky-God).  _Baldr_. (Pages 16 to 22.)  The Baldr theories are stated in the following authorities:  (1) Ritual origin: Frazer, _The Golden Bough_, vol. 3.  (2) Heroic origin: Golther, _Handbuch der Germanischen Mythologie_ (Leipzig, 1895); Niedner, _Eddische Fragen_ (_Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum_, new series, 29), _Zur Lieder-Edda_ (_Zeitschr. f. d. Alt_. vol. 36).  (3) Solar myth: Sir G.W. Cox, _Mythology of the Aryan Nations_ (London, 1870); Max Müller, _Chips from a German Workshop_, vol. 4.  (4) Borrowed: Bugge, _Studien über die Entstchung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen_ (transl. Brenner, München, 1889).  _Vegtamskvida_. (Page 17.)  The word _hrodhrbadhm_ (which I have given as \"branch of fame\") would perhaps be more accurately translated \"tree of fame,\" which Gering explains as a kenning for Baldr. But there are no kennings of the same sort in the poem, and the line would have no meaning. If it refers to the mistletoe, as most commentators agree, it merely shows that the poet was ignorant of the nature of the plant, which would be in favour of its antiquity, rather than the reverse.   _Saxo Grammaticus_. (Page 18.)  English translation by Professor Elton (London, D. Nutt, 1894). As Saxo's references to the old Gods are made in much the same sympathetic tone as that adopted by Old Testament writers towards heathen deities, his testimony on mythological questions is of the less value.   _The Mistletoe_. (Page 20.)  It seems incredible that any writers should turn to the travesty of the Baldr story given in the almost worthless saga of Hromund Gripsson in support of a theory. In it \"Bildr\" is killed by Hromund, who has the sword Mistilteinn. It must be patent to any one that this is a perverted version of a story which the narrator no longer understood.   _Loki_. (Page 26.)  It is hardly necessary to point out the parallel between Loki and Prometheus, also both helper and enemy of the Gods, and agent in their threatened fall, though in the meantime a prisoner. In character Loki has more in common with the mischievous spirit described by Hesiod, than with the heroic figure of Aeschylus. The struggles of Loki (p. 28) find a parallel in those of the fire-serpent Typhon, to which the Greeks attributed earthquakes.   _Eclipse Ritual_. (Page 35.)  Mr. Lang, in _Myth, Ritual, and Religion_, (London, 1887)  gives examples of eclipse ritual. Grimm, in the _Teutonic Mythology_, vol. 2, quotes Finnish and Lithuanian myths about sun-devouring beasts, very similar to the Fenri myth.   _The Skalds_. (Page 35.)  All the Skaldic verses will be found, with translations, in the _Corpus Poeticum_."]]]
