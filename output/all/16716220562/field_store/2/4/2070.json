HAYES  AUTHOR OF \"The Boy Allies in Great Peril,\" \"The Boy Allies at Li√©ge,\" \"The Boy Allies on the Firing Line,\" \"The Boy Allies with the Cossacks,\" \"The Boy Allies in the Trenches.\"                                    1916     CHAPTER I.  IN THE AIR.   \"And how do you feel now, Mr. Stubbs?\"  Hal Paine took his eyes from the distance ahead long enough to gaze toward that part of the military aeroplane in which three other figures were seated. It might rather be said, however, that two of the others were seated, for the third figure was huddled up in a little ball, now and then emitting feeble sounds.  In response to Hal's question, this huddled figure straightened itself up long enough to make reply.  \"I feel sick,\" came the answer in a low voice. \"How long before we can get back to earth, so that I may die peacefully?\"  \"Oh, I guess you won't die, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Hal, chuckling a bit to himself.  He turned his eyes ahead again and gave his entire attention to guiding the swiftly flying craft.  The first streak of dawn had appeared in the east but a few moments before and gradually now it was growing light. High in the air, it was very chilly and those in the aeroplane had drawn their coats closely about them.  \"Where do you suppose we are now, Hal?\"  This speaker was another of the passengers in the car, Chester Crawford, chum and bosom companion of Hal.  \"Somewhere over Central Austria,\" replied Hal, not taking his eyes from ahead.  \"I would rather that it were over Serbia, Montenegro or Greece,\" said the fourth occupant of the airship, Colonel Harry Anderson of His British Majesty's service. \"I'm beginning to get a little cramped up here. I'd like to stretch my legs a bit.\"  \"You won't ever stretch them again, you may be sure of that,\" said a hollow voice, none other than that of Anthony Stubbs, American war correspondent, who now aroused himself enough to predict dire results.  \"What?\" said Colonel Anderson. \"And why won't I ever stretch my legs again?\"  \"The undertaker'll do it for you,\" groaned Stubbs. \"This contraption is bound to come down pretty quick and when it does it'll be all off.\"  \"Can't see why that should worry you any,\" remarked the colonel cheerfully. \"It won't be your funeral.\"  \"No, but I'll have one at about the same time,\" Stubbs moaned. \"I go down when you do.\"  He raised his voice a trifle. \"Let's go down, Hal,\" he continued. \"I'm awfully sick.\"  \"Go down nothing,\" ejaculated Chester. \"Think we want to give the Austrians another chance at us, huh?\"  \"Better be shot by an Austrian than to die in this infernal machine,\" declared Stubbs in a feeble voice.  \"This,\" said Chester calmly, \"is an airship and not an infernal machine.\"  \"Well, it's my idea of an infernal machine, all the same,\" Stubbs groaned. \"We'll all come down in pieces, as sure as you're a foot high.\"  \"Oh, I guess not,\" said Chester. \"We--whoa, there.\"  He broke off suddenly and seized the side of the machine, as did Colonel Anderson, just as the craft tilted dangerously to one side.  \"Help!\" came a cry from Stubbs, as he went rolling toward the side of the craft.  There appeared to be no danger that the little man would be thrown out, for the sides of the basket-like craft protected him, but he was plainly frightened and Chester gave him a hand, now that the machine had righted itself again.  \"It's all right, Stubbs,\" the lad said; \"no danger at all. Sit up, now.\"  The little man shook off the hand.  \"I don't want to sit up,\" he whimpered. \"I want to jump overboard and end all this suspense. I might as well die now as ten minutes from now. Oh my, I wish--\"  \"Well, Mr. Stubbs,\" came Hal's voice, \"unless I miss my guess, you are likely to get your wish. Here comes one of the enemy to watch you die.\"  \"What's that?\" exclaimed Chester and Colonel Anderson in a single voice.  \"Off to the right,\" replied Hal, quietly.  Glancing in that direction, Chester and Colonel Anderson saw a large air craft headed in their direction.  \"After us, do you think?\" asked Chester.  \"Can't tell,\" replied Hal, briefly.  \"Hardly probable,\" said Colonel Anderson. \"Chances are the fellow believes we are one of his own kind and wants a word with us.\"  \"Maybe you're right,\" said Hal. \"I'll hold to my present course anyhow and take a chance.\"  The aeroplane continued on as before.  Now Stubbs came to life once more.  \"Well, why don't you get a little speed out of this thing?\" he demanded. \"What are you going to do? Stand right here and let that fellow get us? What's the matter with you, anyhow? Trying to get me killed?\"  \"Why, Mr. Stubbs,\" exclaimed Chester, in mock seriousness, \"I thought that you were simply dying to be killed. Here's an Austrian coming in direct answer to your prayers. What's the difference whether he gets you now or ten minutes from now? It'll be all the same in a hundred years.\"  \"Think you're smart, don't you,\" snapped Stubbs. \"Why should I want to be killed? I ask you now, why should I want to be killed?\"  \"Well, really, I don't know,\" replied Chester, \"unless it is because you are so awfully sick.\"  \"Sick!\" shouted Stubbs. \"Sick! Who said anything about being sick?\"  \"Why, I understood you to say--\"  \"Well, you understood wrong. Sick? No, I'm not sick, but we'll all be worse than sick if Hal can't coax a little speed out of this machine. Say!\" this to Hal, \"what are you waiting for, anyhow?\"  \"Now you just hold your horses, Stubbs,\" replied Hal. \"I'm running this party at this moment and I'm going to run it my own way. Colonel Anderson, if you hear any more out of our war-corresponding friend, kindly sit on him, will you?\"  \"With pleasure,\" replied the colonel briefly.  \"Oh, you will, will you?\" cried Stubbs. \"Well, you won't. I--I'll--\"  He subsided after muttering to himself for some moments.  The others now gave their undivided attention to the other craft, which by this time had drawn close to them.  \"Man wig-wagging forward, Hal,\" said Chester.  \"I see him,\" replied Hal, \"but I can't make out his signals. Can you, Anderson?\"  \"No, I can't. He evidently has something to say, though.\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"we'll have to hold a sudden council of war. What are we going to do about it? Shall we stop and talk, trying to fool him, or shall we run for it?\"  \"Well, if we were going to run, it would have been better before he got so close,\" said Chester. \"Guess we may as well see what he has to say. These Austrian uniforms won't come in bad. You do the talking, Hal.\"  Hal nodded.  \"All right,\" he said.  He reduced the speed of the machine and the Austrian came closer.  \"Ahoy, there!\" he said in German. \"Who are you?\"  \"Lieutenant Drizladaz, attached to the Austrian army at Trieste,\" Hal shouted back.  \"What are you doing here?\"  \"Mission,\" Hal yelled.  \"Where to?\"  Hal thought quickly.  \"Greece,\" he said finally.  \"What for?\"  \"That,\" said Hal, \"is none of your business. I have my orders and I haven't time to fool around here with you. I'm due back to-morrow night.\"  There was a moment's silence from the other machine and then a voice called:  \"Has your mission anything to do with Greece's intervention in the war?\"  \"Well, I can't say anything about that,\" replied the lad, thinking to give the other the impression that it was.  \"I see,\" was the answer shouted back. \"Well, I wish you luck. Sorry you can't tell me all about it.\"  \"You probably will know soon enough,\" replied Hal.  \"Good. Don't want any company, do you?\"  \"No, I guess not.\"  \"You want to be careful crossing the Balkans. I understand there are some British and French aircraft with the Serbians and Montenegrins. Look out for them.\"  \"I'll be on guard,\" replied Hal. \"Thanks for the information.\"  \"Tell you what,\" said the Austrian, \"I've been doing some scout duty there myself. I'll just trail along. May be able to help you out a bit\"  Hal didn't think much of this plan.  \"I can make it all right myself,\" he declared.  \"Suppose you can,\" was the reply, \"but it is just as well to be on the safe side.\"  \"Well, suit yourself,\" said Hal, \"but don't expect me to wait for you.\"  \"If you can distance me you will have to travel,\" returned the Austrian. \"I've the fastest craft in the service.\"  \"I'm glad to hear that,\" replied Hal, and added to himself: \"I don't think.\"  \"Set your pace,\" continued the Austrian. \"I'll trail along behind.\"  \"No use talking any more, I guess,\" Hal muttered to his friends. \"May as well go along.\"  Chester and Colonel Anderson nodded their assent and the machine moved forward again.  Things might have gone well had it not been for Stubbs. Suddenly the little man uttered a yell and sat up straight in his seat.  \"Ouch!\" he shouted. \"I've got an awful pain!\"     CHAPTER II.  MONTENEGRIN MOUNTAINEERS.   Hal drew a sharp breath and tightened his hold upon the steering wheel.  There was no question that Stubbs' voice had carried to the occupants of the second craft, and as Stubbs had exclaimed aloud in English there was little doubt in the minds of our three friends that the Austrians would seek an explanation. Nor were they wrong.  Came a hail from the Austrian:  \"Who've you got aboard, there?\"  \"Prisoner,\" replied Hal, thinking quickly.  \"What are you doing with him?\"  \"We--\" Hal began, but the Austrian interrupted.  \"Spies, that's what you are! Down to the ground now, or I'll put a hole through you.\"  \"Guess it's no use fooling any longer,\" muttered Hal.  He threw over the elevating lever and the large craft soared rapidly. At the same moment a shot rang out from aboard the Austrian, followed by a cry of surprise, and then the Austrian gave chase.  \"Get your guns and see if you can pick 'em off,\" Hal instructed Chester and Colonel Anderson. \"I'll run this thing, but you fellows will have to do the fighting.\"  \"Suits me,\" responded Chester,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12805"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Balkan Campaign; Or, the Struggle to Save a Nation (#1)"],["body","his revolver carefully.  Colonel Anderson also nodded his agreement to this plan.  Hal now changed his course and the airship headed toward the south, bearing off a trifle to the east, in a direction that he believed, eventually, would land them in Serbia.  It became apparent now that the Austrian had not boasted of the speed of his craft without reason, for he gained perceptibly.  \"We can't out-run him, Hal,\" shouted Chester.  \"Then we shall have to try something else,\" was the reply.  Abruptly he reduced the speed of the craft and the Austrians dashed in range of the revolvers of the fugitives almost before they could have realized it.  \"Crack! Crack!\"  Chester and Colonel Anderson had fired. There came a scream of pain from behind and the Austrian craft wobbled crazily. A moment later a man sprang to his feet, sought to retain his footing, threw up his arms and went hurtling into space.  \"Got one, Hal!\" said Chester, quietly.  \"Good!\"  Came a volley of small arm fire from behind and bullets whined about the four friends. Again Chester and Colonel Anderson fired almost simultaneously and again their efforts were rewarded. A second man was put out of the fight, as they could see.  At this moment Stubbs came into action.  He arose from his seat and, grasping the side of the speeding craft with his left hand for support, stood to his full height. His right arm drew back, then flashed sharply forward again and a small object went spinning through the air toward the Austrian airship.  It struck home and there was a terrible explosion, followed by several sharp cries of pain, as the Austrian airship seemed to split into a thousand pieces. A moment later these pieces disappeared.  The three friends turned upon Stubbs.  \"What is this, magic?\" asked Chester in surprise.  \"No,\" replied Stubbs, quietly. \"Melenite. I just happened to see a stick of it here, so I threw it.\"  \"Well, you did a pretty good job, Stubbs,\" said Colonel Anderson.  \"I didn't pitch for my college team two years for nothing,\" returned Stubbs modestly. \"But now let's go down. I want to get my feet on the ground again.\"  \"It won't be much longer, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"Another two hours at this speed should put us across the Serbian frontier. Just be patient.\"  \"I'll wait,\" replied Stubbs, \"but I won't promise to be patient.\"  He sank back to his place and refused to talk further.  While the big army craft is speeding across Austria it will be a good time to explain the presence of the four friends in their present predicament and introduce them briefly to those who have not met them before.  Hal Paine and Chester Crawford were both American lads. With the former's mother, they had been in Berlin at the outbreak of the great war, and, after a series of interesting and exciting adventures, they made their way to Li√©ge just in time to take part in the defense of that stronghold with the Belgian army.  There they won distinction and lieutenancies in the Belgian service, the latter bestowed upon them by King Albert himself. They had been in France with the British troops that had stopped the German drive on Paris and had gone with the Allied army on its advance. They had seen service on all fronts and now considered themselves veteran campaigners.  Colonel Anderson they had met in Berlin just after the Kaiser had declared war upon France. The colonel, lieutenant then, and Major Derevaux, a Frenchman, had taken the boys with them on their flight and the four had later encountered each other in many strange and unexpected places.  Stubbs they also had met while on one of their many missions and had earned the little man's undying gratitude; but he had repaid whatever they had done for him, with interest, more than once.  The boys, in their latest exploit, had been with the Italian army in the Alps. Two of the four friends having fallen into the hands of the enemy, the others had entered the enemy's lines in an effort to effect their escape.  It was a daring adventure, but after a fight and chase, the four had managed to seize the airship in which we now find them and had at last fought their way clear. They had then held a council of war and decided that it was best to head for the Balkans, rather than to run the gauntlet of the Austrian flying craft which kept constant vigil in the direction of the Italian lines.  Hal and Chester, typical American lads, were large and strong for their ages, which were within a year of each other, seventeen and eighteen now. In the rough lumber camps of the north, the two had had considerable experience in the use of firearms and the art of self-defense--fists. Also, during the school term each had practiced the use of the sword until, though by no means experts, they could give a fair account of themselves with this weapon--as each had done more than once.  Fortunately, both lads had made a study of languages and spoke French and German fluently. They never had trouble on that score.  The great war up to this point had not gone as successfully as the Entente Allies had hoped in the early days. The German lines on all fronts were seemingly stronger than ever before. Even the entrance of Italy into the war on the side of the Allies had failed to turn the balance, as it had been confidently expected it would. East and west, the German lines held, while in the Balkans the enemy was even now advancing against the heroic little Serbian army, which, before many days, was to be forced to relinquish its country to the iron heel of the invader. Montenegro, the smallest factor in the war, still was fighting hard--the rugged and gigantic mountaineers giving a good account of themselves upon all sides.  This was the situation, then, as the airship containing Colonel Anderson, British officer, Anthony Stubbs, American war correspondent, and Hal Paine and Chester Crawford sped southward over Austria.  Several hours after the sinking of the Austrian aeroplane Chester spoke.  \"Where do you suppose we are now, Hal?\" he asked.  \"I believe we must have crossed the frontier,\" replied Hal. \"However, we'll wait another half hour before descending to have a look.\"  The half hour up, Hal sent the airship lower and lower. Soon, a faint gray speck below became visible, assuming larger and larger proportions, until all aboard made out the ground beneath.  And then, half a mile ahead, a body of troops were seen. Hal checked the speed of the craft immediately.  \"Don't know who they are,\" he explained. \"We'll be careful. They may be all right and then again they may not be.\"  He sent the machine higher again and a few minutes later the craft hung directly above the troops below.  \"I can't make out those uniforms,\" declared Chester.  \"Nor I,\" said Hal. \"However, they are not Austrian, I can see that. We'll take a chance and go down.\"  Again the machine moved closer toward the earth, and a few minutes later came to rest upon the ground a short distance from the main body of troops. A squad of men, let by an officer, came hurriedly forward, covering the four friends with their rifles.  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Colonel Anderson. \"You must have miscalculated a bit, Hal. I recognize them now.\"  \"Well, who are they?\" demanded the lad.  \"Montenegrins.\"  \"Good,\" cried Chester. \"Then we are among friends.\"  The four friends raised their hands in token of surrender as the officer and his men came toward them. A few paces away, the officer halted and addressed them.  Hal shook his head.  \"Can't understand that lingo,\" he exclaimed.  He addressed the officer in English and the officer also indicated that he could not understand.  \"Don't want to tackle him in German if I can help it,\" said Hal. \"It might not suit him.\"  \"Well, what's the matter with French?\" Chester wanted to know.  \"Nothing, I guess,\" returned Hal. \"I'll try him. We are British officers,\" he said, addressing the Montenegrin officer, \"and we have just escaped from the Austrians.\"  The Montenegrin understood and replied in broken French:  \"How am I to know you are not of the enemy?\"  \"Well, I don't know, to tell the truth,\" Hal replied with a pleasant smile. \"I am afraid it does look a little bad for us, as we have nothing to prove our identities. But if you have a British or French officer about here, perhaps we can convince him.\"  The Montenegrin nodded.  \"Fortunately, we have,\" he said. He ordered one of his men to summon Colonel Edwards.  \"By Jove!\" said Anderson. \"I know an Edwards. I wonder can it be the same?\"  \"No such luck, I am afraid,\" said Chester.  But it was; and a few moments later Colonel Edwards and Colonel Anderson were shaking hands affectionately.     CHAPTER III.  THE KING OF THE MONTENEGRINS.   With his hand upon Edwards' arm, Colonel Anderson approached Hal and Chester.  \"I want you to meet my two young friends,\" he said.  Colonel Edwards shook hands with each lad in turn and then turned to Stubbs, who, during all this time, had been standing quietly, while he cast a critical eye upon the Montenegrin troopers who stood near.  \"A likely looking bunch of men,\" he muttered to himself. \"I'll bet they could give a good account of themselves in a--\"  He faced about just in time to acknowledge Colonel Anderson's introduction to Colonel Edwards; then turned again to survey the mountaineers.  \"Good fighters, these,\" he said to himself, \"or I miss my guess.\"  \"Now,\" said Hal to Colonel Edwards, \"there is really no use of our standing here. I'd like to look up a place where I can turn in for a few winks. I'm dead tired and I imagine the rest of you are, too.\"  Chester seconded Hal's motion and Colonel Anderson admitted his own fatigue. Stubbs settled the matter.  \"Where there are men there are beds,\" he said; \"or at least cots, or pallets, or something. I'm going to find one.\"  He moved toward a row of tents in the distance.  \"Hold on there,\" said Chester. \"We're all going, Stubbs.\"  In the meantime Colonel Edwards had been holding a consultation with the Montenegrin officer who had"]]]
