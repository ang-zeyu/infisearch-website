Come with me.\"  The three friends followed the young Frenchman and presently were installed in a large, comfortable tent.  \"Turn in whenever you're ready,\" said the Frenchman.  \"We must report to the general at midnight,\" was Hal's reply.  \"What's up?\"  \"You've got me,\" said Hal. \"Hope it's something good, though.\"  \"Probably is, or he wouldn't want you at that hour.\"  \"Well,\" said Stubbs at this point, \"you boys can do what you please. I'm going to get a little sleep.\"  \"All right,\" said Chester. \"If we shouldn't be around in the morning, don't worry. We'll turn up sooner or later.\"  Stubbs nodded and made ready for bed.  At five minutes to twelve o'clock, Hal and Chester started for the headquarters of General Petain.  \"Here's where we get busy again, old man,\" said Chester.     CHAPTER IV  THE BATTLE OPENS   For forty-eight hours the greatest of modern artillery duels had raged incessantly. German guns swept the French positions in all sections of the Verdun region. Fortresses protecting the approach to the city of Verdun had been shattered. The Germans had hurled two and three shells to each one by the French.  But after the first day the French had entrenched themselves behind their earth breastworks, hastily dug and thrown up, and now remained secure. Into these the German guns now poured their fire. The defenders were ready for the first attack by infantry, which it was realized would come soon.  And it came even sooner than was expected.  Hal, with a despatch for the officer in command of the first line troops just to the north of Verdun, was about to return when there came a sudden shout:  \"Here they come!\"  Hal turned quickly.  There, perhaps half a mile away, stretched out a long thin line, barely visible through the dense cloud of smoke that overhung the ground. Hal took in the situation, instantly. The German infantry was advancing to the charge under artillery support.  Behind the first long line stretched out a second and beyond that a third and a fourth and many more. They advanced slowly in the face of a rain of lead turned on them by the men in the trenches. Men fell to the right and to the left, Hal could see, but the gaps were filled instantly and the long lines pressed forward.  Now they were within three hundred yards and the heavy German guns became silent. The advance now must be made without further artillery support, for the German batteries could not fire without imminent danger of shooting down their own men. The Germans broke into a run.  From behind the French earthworks was poured a hail of lead, but it did not serve to check the approaching foe. On to the breastworks they came and clambered up. Behind the first line came many more and they swarmed upon the defenders like bees in a hive.  Bayonet met bayonet and revolvers cracked. Men struggled with their bare hands. Friend and foe went down together, struggling to the last. On the right and on the left, though Hal could not see these actions, similar scenes were being enacted. The Germans had made their initial advance upon a front of almost fifteen miles.  A bugle sounded.  French reinforcements were rushed forward to aid the hard-pressed men in the first line trenches. More Germans poured in. The struggling mass surged backward and forward. Then the French broke and fled, and Hal found himself among a panic-stricken mass of humanity, running for life for the protection of the second line trenches. From behind, the victorious Germans fell to their knees and poured a steady rifle fire upon the vanquished. Over the heads of their fleeing countrymen the second line French troops returned the fire.  Hastily the Germans fell to work throwing up earthworks facing the second French line. Under experienced hands the breastworks sprang up as if by magic. They entrenched calmly under the rifles of the French infantry and the heavy guns of the French batteries, though men fell upon all hands.  Far away, but coming closer, the German batteries now opened fire on the second French trenches, firing above the heads of the victorious German infantry. The infantry action subsided. The duel of big guns was resumed.  Chester, who had been despatched by General Petain with orders, arrived there to witness a scene similar to the one Hal had seen in the center. The German assaults had been successful all along the line. The French had lost their first line trenches on a front of approximately twelve miles. Only at one or two isolated spots had the Germans met reverses; and these few points that the French still held were doubly dangerous now. They could not be given the proper support. Later in the day they were abandoned.  Hal and Chester returned to their posts about the same time. Each was sadly disappointed at the result of the first infantry fighting. For several hours they were kept on the jump carrying despatches, and it was after dark before they found themselves alone together after the strenuous day.  \"Pretty hard,\" said Hal, shaking his head sadly.  \"I should say so,\" Chester agreed. \"It seems to me that those fellows could have been stopped.\"  \"It doesn't to me,\" declared Hal. \"The way they swept into our trenches seemed to me beyond human power to stop. I'm glad they stopped when they did. They probably could have gone farther.\"  \"They'll try again to-morrow,\" said Chester positively.  \"I'm afraid so,\" agreed Hal; \"and if they do, I'm afraid they'll drive us back again.\"  \"And what's the reason?\" demanded Chester.  Hal shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Of course they can only progress so far. They'll wear themselves out by their own exertions. They lost a great deal more heavily than we did to-day; but certainly it seemed as if nothing could stop them.\"  There was little rest for Hal and Chester that night. It seemed to both that they had hardly closed their eyes when they were again summoned to General Petain. Assembled there they found the entire staff. The French commander was reviewing the events of the day and issuing orders and instructions rapidly. He realized that there would be more and probably harder fighting on the next day and he was laying his plans accordingly. Hal and Chester received their instructions for the morrow along with the rest.  Returning to their own quarters again, they were attracted by the sound of confusion a short distance away.  \"Something up,\" said Chester. \"Let's have a look.\"  Nothing loath, Hal followed his chum.  In the light of a large camp fire they made out a crowd of soldiers gathered about in a large circle. Howls of amusement and hilarious laughter rose on the air. Hal and Chester pushed closer and were able to ascertain the cause of merriment.  In the center six French soldiers held a blanket and in the center of this blanket was a man. He rose and fell as the six men alternately released the blanket and then drew it taut again. He was yelling at the top of his voice to be let alone and threatening dire vengeance on his tormentors when he would be able to get at them. But he was laughing and taking the joke good naturedly.  Hal and Chester joined the circle of spectators and derived as much amusement as the others from the proceedings. At length, tiring of their present victim, the men lowered him to the ground. One of them, a large, strapping fellow, perhaps thirty years of age, cast his eye around the circle of faces.  \"Let's get another one,\" he shouted.  There was a chorus of assent from the others and all six set to looking about for a victim who would not prove too willing. As Hal said to Chester, apparently there was no fun tossing a man who took it good naturedly.  At last the big fellow gave a howl of delight and dashed forward. Hal gazed after him. As the big fellow bounded forward, a slight figure in the first row turned and ran. But the big fellow overtook him and dragged him back.  \"Here's one, men,\" he cried. \"See, he doesn't want to come with me. He doesn't know what a good time he is going to have. We'll give him a good one.\"  The others lent a hand and dragged the unwilling captive forward. As they would have put him on the blanket, the youngster--for such the captive proved to be--protested.  \"Some other time, fellows,\" he said. \"I'm sick to-night. I hadn't ought to be out at all, but I couldn't stay in the tent any longer. I'll let you toss me in the blanket some other time, but please let me alone to-night.\"  From where Hal and Chester stood it was plain to see that the boy was telling the truth. His face was deathly pale and he looked very ill.  \"Great Scott,\" said Hal, \"they shouldn't torment him. He is telling the truth.\"  \"Certainly he is,\" Chester agreed. \"I believe the boy is very ill.\"  But the young French boy's protest fell on unheeding ears.  With loud guffaws the men grabbed hold of the blanket and sent the captive spinning aloft. Two, three times he rose and fell, and upon the last was still in the blanket. Apparently the men who held the blanket had not noticed this, however, for they were preparing to toss him aloft again. But Hal had detected the lad's condition. He decided it was time for some one to interfere, and as no one else apparently was ready to call a halt on the proceeding, he determined to take a hand himself.  Quickly he shed his overcoat and then tossed off his jacket and passed them to Chester.  \"Hold 'em!\" he said, and sprang forward.  At the edge of the circle he halted and gazed at the big Frenchman, who had chanced to turn in his direction.  \"Let the boy go,\" he said. \"Can't you see that he is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13020"],["title","The Boy Allies at Verdun; Or, Saving France from the Enemy (#4)"],["body","us?\"  The big Frenchman grinned at him. When Hal had taken off his coat, he had removed all signs of his rank and the soldier had no means of knowing he was an officer.  \"One more toss,\" said the Frenchman.  Hal stepped close to him.  \"The boy is unconscious,\" said the Frenchman, and added: \"Then we'll take you.\"  He nodded to the others in signal that it was time to toss; but before he could move, Hal had seized him by the wrist and whirled him around.  \"You heard me,\" the lad said quietly. \"I meant what I said.\"  He gave the Frenchman's arm a quick twist and the man dropped his hold on the blanket. The Frenchman's hold on the blanket released, the lad upon it tumbled to the ground, where he lay still. Instantly several others bent over and gave their attention to bringing him to. The man whom Hal had confronted turned on him angrily.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded.  \"I told you to let the boy alone and I meant it,\" said Hal quietly.  For answer the Frenchman struck at him. Hal dodged the blow and stepped back. He would have avoided a fight if possible. But the Frenchman stepped after him and struck again. Again Hal dodged and the blow passed harmlessly over his head. The lad struck out quickly with his right and caught the Frenchman a hard blow upon the side of the neck. Big man though he was, the Frenchman toppled over. Hal walked back to where he had left Chester, donned his coat and the two moved away.  Behind them, as the big Frenchman staggered to his feet there was a howl of merriment. The Frenchman shook a fist angrily at Hal's back.     CHAPTER V  THE BLACK PEAS   The howling without continued when Hal and Chester reached their own quarters.  \"Well, you've made another enemy, Hal,\" said Chester.  \"Can't help that,\" was his chum's reply. \"It had to be done. By the way, I wonder what's happened to Stubbs?\"  \"Oh, I guess he is spooking around some place. He'll turn up before long.\"  The lad was right. Hal and Chester had hardly composed themselves to sleep when the flap to the tent was lifted and Stubbs' head appeared. He struck a match and looked at the two lads.  \"Asleep?\" he asked.  Neither lad was, but neither replied. They were both too sleepy to care to enter into a conversation with Stubbs, so they maintained a discreet silence.  \"All right, then,\" said Stubbs, \"if you're asleep I'll soon be with you.\"  He removed his clothing and went to bed.  Stubbs was up early the following morning and when the lads arose entertained them with an account of his wanderings.  \"And,\" he concluded, \"I've stumbled across a story that's a wonder.\"  \"A story?\" repeated Chester.  \"Yes. A 'story' is a newspaper man's way of expressing something big.\"  \"Something to do with the battle?\" asked Hal.  \"It may have and it may not,\" declared Stubbs. \"It may have something to do with the whole war--and it may not. I don't know.\"  \"What is it, Stubbs?\" asked Chester.  Stubbs winked one eye at him.  \"As I happened to stumble across this while I was snooping,\" he said, \"and as you don't think much of snooping, I am going to keep this to myself.\"  \"Come, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Chester, \"you know I was just fooling.\"  \"Well, I may be just fooling now, for all you know,\" said Stubbs.  In vain did the lads plead to know what he was talking about. Stubbs was obdurate and took his departure, announcing that he was going to do some more \"snooping,\" without enlightening them.  Hardly had he gone when the lads received a caller. It was none other than the young French boy whom Hal had rescued from the hands of his tormentors the night before.  \"They told me you came to my aid,\" he said to Hal, \"so I have come to thank you.\"  \"Who are they?\" asked Hal.  \"Some of the men. It was true that I was ill last night. Jules Clemenceau will not forget.\"  The young French boy had stood with one hand in his pocket, and now withdrew the hand and extended it to Hal. As he did so, two small objects fell from his pocket. Apparently Jules did not notice them. Hal shook hands with the boy and the Frenchman took his departure.  Chester, in the meantime, had picked up the two little objects and now he called to Jules, but the young Frenchman did not hear him.  \"Oh, I guess he doesn't want these things, anyhow,\" the lad muttered.  \"What things?\" asked Hal, who had not seen the objects drop from Jules' pocket.  Chester passed one of the objects to him.  \"Know what it is?\" he asked.  \"Sure,\" returned Hal, \"don't you?\"  \"No. What is it?\"  \"A pea.\"  \"I never saw a pea like that.\"  \"Probably not. They are rather rare. A black pea, that's what it is. Where did you get it?\"  \"Jules dropped it out of his pocket.\"  \"Well, as he seems to think I have done him a favor, I am just going to keep this. I guess he won't mind. I'll carry it as a pocket piece.\"  \"Then I'll carry the mate to it,\" said Chester.  He put the little round pea in his pocket and Hal followed suit.  Although neither could possibly have suspected it, these two little peas were to be the means of getting them into all kinds of trouble.  There was heavy fighting that day and when night fell it found the Germans safely entrenched in the French second line trenches along a seven-mile front. For some reason or other Hal and Chester did not get to the front, their duties confining them close to General Petain's headquarters. They were kept busy most of the day, however, and were tired out when they returned to their own quarters late that night.  Ready as they were for bed, they consented to sit up a while and talk with Stubbs, who announced that he had a wonderful tale to unfold.  \"Well,\" said Stubbs, \"I have discovered a strange thing. It's a big thing and there are many men in the French army implicated in it. Most likely in the British, too, and I know that it has touched the ranks of the enemy.\"  \"What is it, a conspiracy?\" asked Chester.  \"It is,\" said Stubbs, \"and it's a whopper. I haven't been able to find the names of any of the leaders and I wouldn't know what to do if I did learn who they are. This one thing, rather than anything else, is likely to disrupt the aims of the Allies.\"  \"Then you had better tell General Petain about it,\" declared Hal.  \"I suppose I should,\" said Stubbs, as he drew out his pipe and proceeded to fill it.  He was quiet a moment as he ran his fingers in his vest pocket, seeking a match.  \"Say, I'm a good one, ain't I?\" he demanded, forgetting his grammar absolutely.  \"What's the matter now?\" asked Hal.  \"Matter is that I can never keep a match. Have you got one?\"  \"Fortunately for you, I have,\" said Chester. \"I don't carry them, as a rule, having no use for them, but I chanced to find a box of safety matches to-day.\"  He reached in his pocket and produced the box; and as he did so the little black pea rolled from his pocket. It rolled toward Stubbs and the little man caught it. He would have returned it to Chester, but as he started to do so he took a close look at it. He gave a sudden start and the box of matches Chester had extended to him dropped to the floor even as his fingers would have closed on it.  \"H-m-m-m,\" he muttered to himself. \"I wonder. I suppose it would be a great thing. I wonder.\"  Stubbs picked up the box of matches and proceeded to light his pipe with deliberation.  \"Well, now that you have that pipe puffing,\" said Hal, \"what's the rest of this story of yours?\"  \"On second thought,\" said Stubbs calmly, \"I have decided to keep it to myself.\"  \"You're not going to tell us?\" demanded Chester.  \"No,\" said Stubbs. \"By the way, here's your black pea,\" for Chester had not noticed that he had dropped it.  \"Thanks,\" said Chester, taking the pea and dropping it in his pocket, \"I wouldn't want to lose it.\"  \"No, I guess not,\" said Stubbs mysteriously. \"Pretty scarce articles. I don't suppose you could find another one in some distance.\"  \"Oh, yes, you could,\" said Hal. \"I have one myself.\"  \"That so?\" said Stubbs, and added to himself: \"I thought so, but I wanted to make sure.\"  Hal produced his black pea. Stubbs examined it carefully and passed it back to him.  \"Better keep it in a safe place,\" he said. \"As I say, they are scarce and it never does a fellow any good to lose anything when there is anyone around.\"  Hal and Chester started guiltily. How could Stubbs know they had found the peas when they fell from the pocket of Jules Clemenceau? Stubbs, who had been watching the two closely, observed these sudden starts and interpreted them to his own satisfaction.  \"Come now, Stubbs,\" said Chester, \"tell us the rest of this story of yours.\"  \"No,\" said Stubbs, \"I am going to keep it to myself.\" He added under his breath: \"The young cubs! Trying to pump an old-timer like me to see how much I know!\"  \"You mean you are not even going to tell the general?\" asked Hal.  \"That's what I mean,\" said Stubbs.  Hal and Chester exchanged glances. They wondered what had come over the little man so suddenly. Stubbs caught the interchange of glances and again he read it wrong. To Stubbs it appeared that there was relief on their features.  Stubbs shook his head.  \"I'm going to turn in,\" he said.  Not another word could the lads get out of him, try as they would. But Stubbs, on his cot, did not sleep immediately. Covertly he watched the two lads as they talked in tones too low for him to hear, strain his ears as he would.  \"Well, I guess I don't need to hear 'em,\" he told himself. \"I can guess what it's all about.\"  He rolled over and went to sleep.  But the nature of the lads' conversation was a whole lot different from what Stubbs thought it was, though it concerned the little man himself.  \"Something wrong with him,\" said Chester.  \"Right you are,\" agreed Hal. \"Talks like we had offended him or something.\"  \"Maybe he just wants to keep us guessing.\"  \"That might be it. Anyhow, if he doesn't tell us to-morrow, I'm going to tell him what I think of him.\"  \"Then he won't talk,\" said Chester.  \"We might be able to get him mad enough to make him talk,\" returned Hal.  \"By Jove!"]]]
