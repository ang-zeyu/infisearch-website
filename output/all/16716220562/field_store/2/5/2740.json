We may perhaps suppose that, as ticklishness has probably developed under the influence of natural selection as a method of protection against attack and a warning of the approach of foreign bodies, its end would be defeated if it involved a simple reaction to the contact of the organism with itself. This need of protection it is which involves the necessity of a minimal excitation producing a maximal effect, though the mechanism whereby this takes place has caused considerable discussion. We may, it is probable, best account for it by invoking the summation-irradiation theory of pain-pleasure, the summation of the stimuli in their course through the nerves, aided by capillary congestion, leading to irradiation due to anastomoses between the tactile corpuscles, not to speak of the much wider irradiation which is possible by means of central nervous connections.      Prof. C.L. Herrick adopts this explanation of the phenomena of     tickling, and rests it, in part, on Dogiel's study of the tactile     corpuscles (\"Psychological Corollaries of Modern Neurological     Discoveries,\" _Journal of Comparative Neurology_, March, 1898).     The following remarks of Prof. A. Allin may also be quoted in     further explanation of the same theory: \"So far as ticklishness     is concerned, a very important factor in the production of this     feeling is undoubtedly that of the summation of stimuli. In a     research of Stirling's, carried on under Ludwig's direction, it     was shown that reflex contractions only occur from repeated     shocks to the nerve-centres--that is, through summation of     successive stimuli. That this result is also due in some degree     to an alternating increase in the sensibility of the various     areas in question from altered supply of blood is reasonably     certain. As a consequence of this summation-process there would     result in many cases and in cases of excessive nervous discharge     the opposite of pleasure, namely: pain. A number of instances     have been recorded of death resulting from tickling, and there is     no reason to doubt the truth of the statement that Simon de     Montfort, during the persecution of the Albigenses, put some of     them to death by tickling the soles of their feet with a feather.     An additional causal factor in the production of tickling may lie     in the nature and structure of the nervous process involved in     perception in general. According to certain histological     researches of recent years we know that between the sense-organs     and the central nervous system there exist closely connected     chains of conductors or neurons, along which an impression     received by a single sensory cell on the periphery is propagated     avalanchelike through an increasing number of neurons until the     brain is reached. If on the periphery a single cell is excited     the avalanchelike process continues until finally hundreds or     thousands of nerve-cells in the cortex are aroused to     considerable activity. Golgi, Ramón y Cajal, Koelliker, Held,     Retzius, and others have demonstrated the histological basis of     this law for vision, hearing, and smell, and we may safely assume     from the phenomena of tickling that the sense of touch is not     lacking in a similar arrangement. May not a suggestion be     offered, with some plausibility, that even in ideal or     representative tickling, where tickling results, say, from     someone pointing a finger at the ticklish places, this     avalanchelike process may be incited from central centres, thus     producing, although in a modified degree, the pleasant phenomena     in question? As to the deepest causal factor, I should say that     tickling is the result of vasomotor shock.\" (A. Allin, \"On     Laughter,\" _Psychological Review_, May, 1903.)  The intellectual element in tickling conies out in its connection with laughter and the sense of the comic, of which it may be said to constitute the physical basis. While we are not here concerned with laughter and the comic sense,--a subject which has lately attracted considerable attention,--it may be instructive to point out that there is more than an analogy between laughter and the phenomena of sexual tumescence and detumescence. The process whereby prolonged tickling, with its nervous summation and irradiation and accompanying hyperæmia, finds sudden relief in an explosion of laughter is a real example of tumescence--as it has been defined in the study in another volume entitled \"An Analysis of the Sexual Impulse\"--resulting finally in the orgasm of detumescence. The reality of the connection between the sexual embrace and tickling is indicated by the fact that in some languages, as in that of the Fuegians,[12] the same word is applied to both. That ordinary tickling is not sexual is due to the circumstances of the case and the regions to which the tickling is applied. If, however, the tickling is applied within the sexual sphere, then there is a tendency for orgasm to take place instead of laughter. The connection which, through the phenomena of tickling, laughter thus bears to the sexual sphere is well indicated, as Groos has pointed out, by the fact that in sexually-minded people sexual allusions tend to produce laughter, this being the method by which they are diverted from the risks of more specifically sexual detumescence.[13]      Reference has been made to the view of Alrutz, according to which     tickling is a milder degree of itching. It is more convenient and     probably more correct to regard itching or pruritus, as it is     termed in its pathological forms, as a distinct sensation, for it     does not arise under precisely the same conditions as tickling     nor is it relieved in the same way. There is interest, however,     in pointing out in this connection that, like tickling, itching     has a real parallelism to the specialized sexual sensations.     Bronson, who has very ably interpreted the sensations of itching     (New York Neurological Society, October 7, 1890; _Medical News_,     February 14, 1903, and summarized in the _British Medical     Journal_, March 7, 1903; and elsewhere), regards it as a     perversion of the sense of touch, a dysæsthesia due to obstructed     nerve-excitation with imperfect conduction of the generated force     into correlated nervous energy. The scratching which relieves     itching directs the nervous energy into freer channels, sometimes     substituting for the pruritus either painful or voluptuous     sensations. Such voluptuous sensations may be regarded as a     generalized aphrodisiac sense comparable to the specialized     sexual orgasm. Bronson refers to the significant fact that     itching occurs so frequently in the sexual region, and states     that sexual neurasthenia is sometimes the only discoverable cause     of genital and anal pruritus. (Cf. discussion on pruritus,     _British Medical Journal_, November 30, 1895.) Gilman, again     (_American Journal of Psychology_, vi, p. 22), considers that     scratching, as well as sneezing, is comparable to coitus.  The sexual embrace has an intimate connection with the phenomena of ticklishness which could not fail to be recognized. This connection is, indeed, the basis of Spinoza's famous definition of love,--\"_Amor est titillatio quædam concomitante idea causæ externæ_,\"--a statement which seems to be reflected in Chamfort's definition of love as \"_l'échange de deux fantaisies, et le contact de deux epidermes_.\" The sexual act, says Gowers, is, in fact, a skin reflex.[14] \"The sexual parts,\" Hall and Allin state, \"have a ticklishness as unique as their function and as keen as their importance.\" Herrick finds the supreme illustration of the summation and irradiation theory of tickling in the phenomena of erotic excitement, and points out that in harmony with this the skin of the sexual region is, as Dogiel has shown, that portion of the body in which the tactile corpuscles are most thoroughly and elaborately provided with anastomosing fibres. It has been pointed out[15] that, when ordinary tactile sensibility is partially abolished,--especially in hemianæsthesia in the insane,--some sexual disturbance is specially apt to be found in association.  In young children, in girls even when they are no longer children, and occasionally in men, tickling may be a source of acute pleasure, which in very early life is not sexual, but later tends to become so under circumstances predisposing to the production of erotic emotion, and especially when the nervous system is keyed up to a high tone favorable for the production of the maximum effect of tickling.      \"When young,\" writes a lady aged 28, \"I was extremely fond of     being tickled, and I am to some extent still. Between the ages of     10 and 12 it gave me exquisite pleasure, which I now regard as     sexual in character. I used to bribe my younger sister to tickle     my feet until she was tired.\"      Stanley Hall and Allin in their investigation of the phenomena of     tickling, largely carried out among young women teachers, found     that in 60 clearly marked cases ticklishness was more marked at     one time than another, \"as when they have been 'carrying on,' or     are in a happy mood, are nervous or unwell, after a good meal,     when being washed, when in perfect health, when with people they     like, etc.\" (Hall and Allin, \"Tickling and Laughter,\" _American     Journal of Psychology_, October, 1897.) It will be observed that     most of the conditions mentioned are such as would be favorable     to excitations of an emotionally sexual character.      The palms of the hands may be very ticklish during sexual     excitement, especially in women, and Moll (_Konträre     Sexualempfindung_, p. 180) remarks that in some men titillation     of the skin of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#5)"],["body","back, of the feet, and even of the forehead     evokes erotic feelings.      It may be added that, as might be expected, titillation of the     skin often has the same significance in animals as in man. \"In     some animals,\" remarks Louis Robinson (art. \"Ticklishness,\"     _Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_), \"local titillation of     the skin, though in parts remote from the reproductive organs,     plainly acts indirectly upon them as a stimulus. Thus, Harvey     records that, by stroking the back of a favorite parrot (which he     had possessed for years and supposed to be a male), he not only     gave the bird gratification,--which was the sole intention of the     illustrious physiologist,--but also caused it to reveal its sex     by laying an egg.\"  The sexual significance of tickling is very clearly indicated by the fact that the general ticklishness of the body, which is so marked in children and in young girls, greatly diminishes, as a rule, after sexual relationships have been established. Dr. Gina Lombroso, who investigated the cutaneous reflexes, found that both the abdominal and plantar reflexes, which are well marked in childhood and in young people between the ages of 15 and 18, were much diminished in older persons, and to a greater extent in women than in men, to a greater extent in the abdominal region than on the soles of the feet;[16] her results do not directly show the influence of sexual relationship, but they have an indirect bearing which is worth noting.  The difference in ticklishness between the unmarried woman and the married woman corresponds to their difference in degree of modesty. Both modesty and ticklishness may be said to be characters which are no longer needed. From this point of view the general ticklishness of the skin is a kind of body modesty. It is so even apart from any sexual significance of tickling, and Louis Robinson has pointed out that in young apes, puppies, and other like animals the most ticklish regions correspond to the most vulnerable spots in a fight, and that consequently in the mock fights of early life skill in defending these spots is attained.      In Iceland, according to Margarethe Filhés (as quoted by Max     Bartels, _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1900, ht. 2-3, p. 57), it     may be known whether a youth is pure or a maid is intact by their     susceptibility to tickling. It is considered a bad sign if that     is lost.      I am indebted to a medical correspondent for the following     communication: \"Married women have told me that they find that     after marriage they are not ticklish under the arms or on the     breasts, though before marriage any tickling or touching in these     regions, especially by a man, would make them jump or get     hysterical or 'queer,' as they call it. Before coitus the sexual     energy seems to be dissipated along all the nerve-channels and     especially along the secondary sexual routes,--the breasts, nape     of neck, eyebrows, lips, cheeks, armpits, and hair thereon,     etc.,--but after marriage the surplus energy is diverted from     these secondary channels, and response to tickling is diminished.     I have often noted in insane cases, especially mania in     adolescent girls, that they are excessively ticklish. Again, in     ordinary routine practice I have observed that, though married     women show no ticklishness during auscultation and percussion of     the chest, this is by no means always so in young girls. Perhaps     ticklishness in virgins is Nature's self-protection against rape     and sexual advances, and the young girl instinctively wishing to     hide the armpits, breasts, and other ticklish regions, tucks     herself up to prevent these parts being touched. The married     woman, being in love with a man, does not shut up these parts, as     she reciprocates the advances that he makes; she no longer     requires ticklishness as a protection against sexual aggression.\"   FOOTNOTES:  [5] Alrutz's views are summarized in _Psychological Review_, Sept., 1901.

We have seen that the skin generally has a high degree of sensibility, which frequently tends to be in more or less definite association with the sexual centres. We have seen also that the central and specific sexual sensation, the sexual embrace itself, is, in large measure, a specialized kind of skin reflex. Between the generalized skin sensations and the great primary sexual centre of sensation there are certain secondary sexual centres which, on account of their importance, may here be briefly considered.  These secondary centres have in common the fact that they always involve the entrances and the exits of the body--the regions, that is, where skin merges into mucous membrane, and where, in the course of evolution, tactile sensibility has become highly refined. It may, indeed, be said generally of these frontier regions of the body that their contact with the same or a similar frontier region in another person of opposite sex, under conditions otherwise favorable to tumescence, will tend to produce a minimum and even sometimes a maximum degree of sexual excitation. Contact of these regions with each other or with the sexual region itself so closely simulates the central sexual reflex that channels are set up for the same nervous energy and secondary sexual centres are constituted.  It is important to remember that the phenomena we are here concerned with are essentially normal. Many of them are commonly spoken of as perversions. In so far, however, as they are aids to tumescence they must be regarded as coming within the range of normal variation. They may be considered unæsthetic, but that is another matter. It has, moreover, to be remembered that æsthetic values are changed under the influence of sexual emotion; from the lover's point of view many things are beautiful which are unbeautiful from the point of view of him who is not a lover, and the greater the degree to which the lover is swayed by his passion the greater the extent to which his normal æsthetic standard is liable to be modified. A broad consideration of the phenomena among civilized and uncivilized peoples amply suffices to show the fallacy of the tendency, so common among unscientific writers on these subjects, to introduce normal æsthetic standards into the sexual sphere. From the normal standpoint of ordinary daily life, indeed, the whole process of sex is unæsthetic, except the earlier stages of tumescence.[17]  So long as they constitute a part of the phase of tumescence, the utilization of the sexual excitations obtainable through these channels must be considered within the normal range of variation, as we may observe, indeed, among many animals. When, however, such contacts of the orifices of the body, other than those of the male and female sexual organs proper, are used to procure not merely tumescence, but detumescence, they become, in the strict and technical sense, perversions. They are perversions in exactly the same sense as are the methods of intercourse which involve the use of checks to prevent fecundation. The æsthetic question, however, remains the same as if we were dealing with tumescence. It is necessary that this should be pointed out clearly, even at the risk of misapprehension, as confusions are here very common.      The essentially sexual character of the sensitivity of the     orificial contacts is shown by the fact that it may sometimes be     accidentally developed even in early childhood. This is well     illustrated in a case recorded by Féré. A little girl of 4, of     nervous temperament and liable to fits of anger in which she     would roll on the ground and tear her clothes, once ran out into     the garden in such a fit of temper and threw herself on the lawn     in a half-naked condition. As she lay there two dogs with whom     she was accustomed to play came up and began to lick the     uncovered parts of the body. It so happened that as one dog     licked her mouth the other licked her sexual parts. She     experienced a shock of intense sensation which she could never     forget and never describe, accompanied by a delicious tension of     the sexual organs. She rose and "]]]
