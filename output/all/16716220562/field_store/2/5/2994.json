Roll the paste out, cut it in squares of about 4 inches, and place as much mushroom on each as it will conveniently hold. Press the edges of each square together, folding them in triangular shape, and bake them in a moderate oven for an hour. Serve with brown gravy.   OATMEAL PIE-CRUST.  4 oz. each of medium oatmeal and Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 2-1/2 oz. of vege-butter or butter. Make the crust in the usual way with cold water. It will be found beautifully short, very tasty, and more digestible than white flour pastry.   ONION TART.  1 lb. of Spanish onions, 1 lb. of English onions, 4 oz. of butter, 3 eggs, 1/2 pint of cream, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal. Slice the onions, and stew them with 1-1/2 oz. of butter without browning them. When tender let the onions cool, mix with them the eggs, well beaten, and the cream, also the seasoning. Make a paste with the meal and the rest of the butter, line with it a baking-tin, keeping back a small quantity of the paste; pour the mixture of onions, eggs, and cream into the paste-lined tin, cut the rest of the paste into thin strips, and lay these crossways over the tart, forming diamond-shaped squares; bake the tart in a moderate oven until golden brown.   ONION TURNOVER.  2 medium-sized Spanish onions, 1 oz. of butter (or Allinson frying oil), 3 eggs, pepper and salt. For the pastry, 6 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2-1/2 oz. of butter or oil. Chop the onions fine, boil them a few minutes in a little water, and drain them; stew them in the butter for 10 minutes, adding the seasoning beat up the eggs and mix them well with the onions over the fire, remove the mixture as it begins to set. Have ready the pastry made with the meal, butter, and a little cold water, roll it out, place the onions and eggs on it, fold the pastry over, pinching the edges over, and bake the turnover brown. Serve with gravy. This is a Turkish dish.   POTATO PIE.  Slice potatoes and onions, stew with a little water until nearly done, put into a pie-dish, flavour with herbs, pepper, and salt, add a little soaked tapioca and very little butter, cover with short wheatmeal crust, and bake 1 hour. To make a very plain pie-crust use about 2 oz. of butter or a proportionate quantity of Allinson frying oil to 1 lb. of wheatmeal. Roll or touch with the fingers as little as possible, and mix with milk instead of water. Eat this pie with green vegetables.   POTATO AND TOMATO PIE.  2 lbs. of potatoes, 2 lbs. of tomatoes, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1 oz. of vermicelli or sago, 1 Spanish onion, 1 dessertspoonful of thyme, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. For the crust, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3 oz. of butter, and as much cold water as needed. Boil the potatoes in their skins, and when nearly soft drain, peel, and cut them into pieces, scald and skin the tomatoes and cut them into pieces also. Mix them with the potatoes in a pie-dish. Chop up roughly the onion, and boil in about 1 pint of water, adding the butter and the vermicelli or sago. Cook until soft. Add pepper and salt, and mix all with the potatoes and tomatoes. Sprinkle in the thyme, and mix all the ingredients well. Quarter the eggs and place the pieces on the top of the vegetables. Make the crust, cover the dish with it, and bake the pie from 3/4 of an hour to 1 hour. The crust looks better if brushed over with white of egg before baking.   POTATOES AND MUSHROOM STEW.  1-1/2 lbs. of potatoes, 1 Spanish onion, 1/2 lb. of mushrooms, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt, and 1 teaspoonful of Allinson cornflour for thickening. Peel, wash, and cut into pieces the potatoes; chop up the onion, and set both over the fire with 1 pint of water, the butter and seasoning; let cook until the potatoes are about half done. Meanwhile skin, wash, and cut into pieces the mushrooms, add them to the other ingredients, and let all stew together until tender. Thicken the liquid with the cornflour, boil up, and serve.   QUEEN'S APPLE AND ONION PIE.  3 breakfastcupfuls of Allinson breadcrumbs, 3 eggs, 1-1/2 lbs. of apples, 2 lbs. of Spanish onions, 2 oz. of butter, 1/2 teaspoonful of spice, pepper and salt to taste, and a little hot milk; cut into slices the onions and apples, stew them gently (without adding-water) with 1 oz. of the butter, the spice and seasoning until quite tender. Mix the breadcrumbs with the eggs, well beaten, and enough hot milk to smooth the breadcrumbs; butter a pie-dish with 1/2 oz. of butter, place a layer of breadcrumbs in your dish, a layer of apple and onion, repeat this until your dish is full, finishing with breadcrumbs. Place the rest of the butter on the top in little bits, and bake the pie for 1 hour. Serve with brown gravy.   QUEEN'S ONION PIE.  3 lbs of Spanish onions, 3 breakfastcupfuls of Allinson breadcrumbs, 3 eggs, 3 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of mixed herbs, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, pepper and salt to taste, and a little hot milk. Stew the onions in 2 oz. of butter, adding the herbs and seasoning. Prepare the breadcrumbs in the same way as for \"Queen's Onion and Apple Pie,\" place the onions and breadcrumbs in layers as in the previous recipe, and bake 1 hour.   QUEEN'S TOMATO PIE.  8 breakfastcupfuls of Allinson breadcrumbs, 3 eggs, 2 lbs. of tomatoes, 2 finely chopped onions, 1/2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, a little boiling milk; 1 dessertspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Cut the tomatoes into slices, and stew them gently with 1 oz. of the butter, the onions and seasoning for 10 minutes, then add the parsley. Soak the breadcrumbs with enough hot milk to just moisten them through, add the eggs beaten up. Grease a pie-dish, place in it first a layer of breadcrumbs, then one of tomatoes and so on until full, finishing with breadcrumbs. Put the rest of the butter in little bits on the top of the pie, and bake it until lightly brown.   SAVOURY CUSTARD.  1 quart of milk; 6 eggs, 6 oz. of grated cheese, Parmesan is the best, but any kind of cooking cheese can be used; 1/2 a saltspoonful of nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste. Heat the milk; meanwhile whip the eggs well, and mix the cheese and seasoning with them. Mix well with the hot milk, pour the mixture into a buttered pie-dish, and bake in a moderately hot oven until set. Serve with green vegetables and potatoes.   SAVOURY CUSTARD (Another way).  1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful each of finely chopped parsley and spring onion. Proceed as above; mix the herbs and onion with the custard, and bake until set.   SAVOURY FRITTERS (1).  1 teacupful of mashed potatoes, 1/2 lb. of breadcrumbs, 1 large English onion, 2 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of powdered sage, 1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste. Chop the onion up fine and fry it brown in the butter. Whip up the eggs and mix both ingredients with the breadcrumbs; add the mashed potatoes, herbs, and seasoning, and mix all well together. Form into fritters, dredge with flour, and fry them a nice brown. Serve with vegetables, potatoes, and sauce.   SAVOURY FRITTERS (2).  12 oz. of onions, 6 oz. of breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoonful of dried sage, 2 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Chop the onions up small and fry them in the butter, or oil a nice brown, then add the sage to them. Mix a third of the onions with the breadcrumbs, add the eggs well beaten, pepper and salt; mix all well, form into fritters, and fry in butter or oil. The remainder of the onions place round the fritters on the dish. Serve with apple sauce.   SAVOURY PICKLED WALNUT.  1/2 lb. of Allinson bread, 1 pint of milk, 3 eggs, 4 pickled walnuts and the vinegar to taste, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, 1 teaspoonful of powdered mixed herbs, 1 grated English onion, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Soak the bread in the milk, add the parsley, herbs, onion, eggs and seasoning. Mash up the pickled walnuts, dissolve part of the butter on the stove and add both to the other ingredients; mix all well. Butter a pie-dish with the rest of the butter, pour in the mixture, and bake.   SAVOURY PIE.  6 oz. of haricot beans, 1/2 lb. of onions, 1 lb. of tomatoes, 1/2 lb. of parboiled potatoes, 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 teaspoonful of herbs, 4 oz. of butter, 1/2 lb. of fine wheatmeal, pepper and salt to taste. Have the beans boiled the previous day, place them in a pie-dish, chop up the onions and boil them in a little water until soft, cut the potatoes in small dice, slice the tomatoes, cut up the eggs, and mix all the ingredients thoroughly in the pie dish, adding the herbs, 1 oz. of butter, and seasoning. Pour over the mixture 1 pint of water, and let it cook for 1 hour in the oven. Make a paste of the wheatmeal, the rest of the butter and a little cold water, cover the vegetables with it, and bake the pie 1 hour in a moderate oven.   SAVOURY TARTLETS.  4 eggs, 4 oz. grated cheese, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of mustard, 1 gill of cream, pepper and salt to taste. For the crust 6 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 2 oz. of butter. Whip up the eggs and add to each egg 1 dessertspoonful of water. Dissolve the mustard in a little water; mix this, the cheese and seasoning with the eggs. Heat the butter in a frying-pan, and when boiling stir in the eggs and cheese mixture, stirring it with a knife over the fire until set. Turn the mixture into a bowl to cool. Meanwhile have ready the paste for the pastry. Rub the butter into the flour, add enough water to make it hold together, mixing the paste with a knife. Roll it out thin, line small patty pans, fill with the egg and cheese mixture. Moisten the edges of the paste in the patty pans, cover with paste, and press the edges together. Bake the little tartlets in a moderately hot oven until done; they will take from 15 to 20 minutes.

In preparing this sketch it is needless to say how deeply I am indebted to Mr. Spedding and Mr. Ellis, the last editors of Bacon's writings, the very able and painstaking commentators, the one on Bacon's life, the other on his philosophy. It is impossible to overstate the affectionate care and high intelligence and honesty with which Mr. Spedding has brought together and arranged the materials for an estimate of Bacon's character. In the result, in spite of the force and ingenuity of much of his pleading, I find myself most reluctantly obliged to differ from him; it seems to me to be a case where the French saying, cited by Bacon in one of his commonplace books, holds good--\"_Par trop se débattre, la vérité se perd_.\"[1] But this does not diminish the debt of gratitude which all who are interested about Bacon must owe to Mr. Spedding. I wish also to acknowledge the assistance which I have received from Mr. Gardiner's _History of England_ and Mr. Fowler's edition of the _Novum Organum_; and not least from M. de Rémusat's work on Bacon, which seems to me the most complete and the most just estimate both of Bacon's character and work which has yet appeared; though even in this clear and dispassionate survey we are reminded by some misconceptions, strange in M. de Rémusat, how what one nation takes for granted is incomprehensible to its neighbour; and what a gap there is still, even in matters of philosophy and literature, between the whole Continent and ourselves--       \"Penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.\"  FOOTNOTES:  [1] _Promus_: edited by Mrs. H.

BACON AS A WRITER                        198     BACON.  CHAPTER I.  EARLY LIFE.   The life of Francis Bacon is one which it is a pain to write or to read. It is the life of a man endowed with as rare a combination of noble gifts as ever was bestowed on a human intellect; the life of one with whom the whole purpose of living and of every day's work was to do great things to enlighten and elevate his race, to enrich it with new powers, to lay up in store for all ages to come a source of blessings which should never fail or dry up; it was the life of a man who had high thoughts of the ends and methods of law and government, and with whom the general and public good was regarded as the standard by which the use of public power was to be measured; the life of a man who had struggled hard and successfully for the material prosperity and opulence which makes work easy and gives a man room and force for carrying out his purposes. All his life long his first and never-sleeping passion was the romantic and splendid ambition after knowledge, for the conquest of nature and for the service of man; gathering up in himself the spirit and longings and efforts of all discoverers and inventors of the arts, as they are symbolised in the mythical Prometheus. He rose to the highest place and honour; and yet that place and honour were but the fringe and adornment of all that made him great. It is difficult to imagine a grander and more magnificent career; and his name ranks among the few chosen examples of human achievement. And yet it was not only an unhappy life; it was a poor life. We expect that such an overwhelming weight of glory should be borne up by a character corresponding to it in strength and nobleness. But that is not what we find. No one ever had a greater idea of what he was made for, or was fired with a greater desire to devote himself to it. He was all this. And yet being all this, seeing deep into man's worth, his capacities, his greatness, his weakness, his sins, he was not true to what he knew. He cringed to such a man as Buckingham. He sold himself to the corrupt and ignominious Government of James I. He was willing to be employed to hunt to death a friend like Essex, guilty, deeply guilty, to the State, but to Bacon the most loving and generous of benefactors. With his eyes open he gave himself up without resistance to a system unworthy of him; he would not see what was evil in it, and chose to call its evil good; and he was its first and most signal victim.  Bacon has been judged with merciless severity. But he has also been defended by an advocate whose name alone is almost a guarantee for the justness of the cause which he takes up, and the innocency of the client for whom he argues. Mr. Spedding devoted nearly a lifetime, and all the resources of a fine intellect and an earnest conviction, to make us revere as well as admire Bacon. But it is vain. It is vain to fight against the facts of his life: his words, his letters. \"Men are made up,\" says a keen observer, \"of professions, gifts, and talents; and also of _themselves_.\"[2] With all his greatness, his splendid genius, his magnificent ideas, his enthusiasm for truth, his passion to be the benefactor of his kind; with all the charm that made him loved by good and worthy friends, amiable, courteous, patient, delightful as a companion, ready to take any trouble--there was in Bacon's \"self\" a deep and fatal flaw. He was a pleaser of men. There was in him that subtle fault, noted and named both by philosophy and religion in the [Greek: areskos] of Aristotle, the [Greek: anthrôpareskos] of St. Paul, which is more common than it is pleasant to think, even in good people, but which if it becomes dominant in a character is ruinous to truth and power. He was one of the men--there are many of them--who are unable to release their imagination from the impression of present and immediate power, face to face with themselves. It seems as if he carried into conduct the leading rule of his philosophy of nature, _parendo vincitur_. In both worlds, moral and physical, he felt himself encompassed by vast forces, irresistible by direct opposition. Men whom he wanted to bring round to his purposes were as strange, as refractory, as obstinate, as impenetrable as the phenomena of the natural world. It was no use attacking in front, and by a direct trial of strength, people like Elizabeth or Cecil or James; he might as well think of forcing some natural power in defiance of natural law. The first word of his teaching about nature is that she must be won by observation of her tendencies and demands; the same radical disposition of temper reveals itself in his dealings with men: they, too, must be won by yielding to them, by adapting himself to their moods and ends; by spying into the drift of their humour, by subtly and pliantly falling in with it, by circuitous and indirect processes, the fruit of vigilance and patient thought. He thought to direct, while submitting apparently to be directed. But he mistook his strength. Nature and man are different powers, and under different laws. He chose to please man, and not to follow what his soul must have told him was the better way. He wanted, in his dealings with men, that sincerity on which he insisted so strongly in his dealings with nature and knowledge. And the ruin of a great life was the consequence.  Francis Bacon was born in London on the 22d of January, 1560/61, three years before Galileo. He was born at York House, in the Strand; the house which, though it belonged to the Archbishops of York, had been lately tenanted by Lord Keepers and Lord Chancellors, in which Bacon himself afterwards lived as Lord Chancellor, and which passed after his fall into the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, who has left his mark in the Water Gate which is now seen, far from the river, in the garden of the Thames Embankment. His father was Sir Nicholas Bacon, Elizabeth's first Lord Keeper, the fragment of whose effigy in the Crypt of St. Paul's is one of the few"]]]
