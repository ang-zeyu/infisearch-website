Many were afflicted with nausea. With others the muscles of speech contracted convulsively, knees gave way, hearts \"stopped beating.\" Observe that these were wholly the effects of _mental_ action, effects of _sight_ and _sound sensations_.  [Sidenote: The Fundamental Law of Expression]  Why multiply instances? All that you need to do to be satisfied that the mind is directly responsible for any and every kind of bodily activity is to examine your own experiences and those of your friends. They will afford you innumerable illustrations.  You will find that not only is your body constantly doing things because your mind wills that it should do them, but that your body is incessantly doing things simply because they are the expression of a passing thought.  The law that _Every idea tends to express itself in some form of bodily activity_, is one of the most obviously demonstrable principles of human life.  Bear in mind that this is but another way of expressing the second of our first two fundamental principles of mental efficiency, and that we are engaged in a scientific demonstration of its truth so that you will not confuse it with mere theory or speculation.  To recall these fundamental principles to your mind and further impress them upon you, we will restate them:  I. _All human achievement comes about through some form of bodily activity_.  II. _All bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the mind._     PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF MENTAL MASTERY     CHAPTER V  PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF MENTAL MASTERY   [Sidenote: Introspective Knowledge]  We have been considering the relationship between mind and body from the standpoint of the mind. Our investigation has been largely introspective; that is to say, we simply looked within ourselves and considered the effects of our mental operations upon our own bodies. The facts we had before us were facts of which we had direct knowledge. We did not have to go out and seek them in the mental and bodily activities of other persons. We found them here within ourselves, inherent in our consciousness. To observe them we had merely to turn the spotlight into the hidden channels of our own minds.  [Sidenote: Dissection and the Governing Consciousness]  We come now to examine the mind's influence upon the body from the standpoint of the body. To do this we must go forth and investigate. We must use eye, ear and hand. We must use the forceps and scalpel and microscope of the anatomist and physiologist.  [Sidenote: Subordinate Mental Units]  _But it is well worth while that we should do this. For our investigation will show a bodily structure peculiarly adapted to control by a governing consciousness. It will reveal to the eye a physical mechanism peculiarly fitted for the dissemination of intelligence throughout the body. And, most of all, it will disclose the existence within the body of subordinate mental units, each capable of receiving, understanding and acting upon the intelligence thus submitted. And we shall have strongly corroborative evidence of the mind's complete control over every function of the body._  Examine a green plant and you will observe that it is composed of numerous parts, each of which has some special function to perform. The roots absorb food and drink from the soil. The leaves breathe in carbonic acid from the air and transform it into the living substance of the plant. Every plant has, therefore, an anatomical structure, its parts and tissues visible to the naked eye.  [Sidenote: What the Microscope Shows]  Put one of these tissues under a microscope and you will find that it consists of a _honeycomb of small compartments or units_. These compartments are called \"cells,\" and the structure of all plant tissues is described as \"cellular.\" Wherever you may look in any plant, you will find these cells making up its tissues. The activity of any part or tissue of the plant, and consequently all of the activities of the plant as a whole, are but the combined and co-operating activities of the various individual cells of which the tissues are composed. _The living cell, therefore, is at the basis of all plant life._  [Sidenote: The Little Universe Beyond]  In the same way, if you turn to the structure of any animal, you will find that it is composed of parts or organs made up of different kinds of tissues, and these tissues examined under a microscope will disclose a cellular structure similar to that exhibited by the plant.  _Look where you will among living things, plant or animal, you will find that all are mere assemblages of cellular tissues._  Extend your investigation further, and examine into forms of life so minute that they can be seen only with the most powerful microscope and you will come upon a _whole universe of tiny creatures consisting of a single cell_.  [Sidenote: The Unit of Life]  Indeed, it is a demonstrable fact that these tiny units of life consisting of but a single cell are far more numerous than the forms of life visible to the naked eye. You will have some idea of their size and number when we tell you that millions may live and die and reproduce their kind in a single thimbleful of earth.  _Every plant, then, or every animal, whatever its species, however simple or complicated its structure, is in the last analysis either a single cell or a confederated group of cells._  All life, whether it be the life of a single cell or of an unorganized group of cells or of a republic of cells, has as its basis the life of the cell.  For all the animate world, two great principles stand established. First, that _every living organism_, plant or animal, big or little, develops from a cell, and is itself a composite of cells, and that the cell is the unit of all life. Secondly, that _the big and complex organisms have through long ages developed out of simpler forms_, the organic life of today being the result of an age-long process of evolution.  What, then, is the cell, and what part has it played in this process of evolution?  To begin with, a cell is visible only through a microscope. A human blood cell is about one-three-thousandth of an inch across, while a bacterial cell may be no more than one-twenty-five-thousandth of an inch in diameter.  [Sidenote: Characteristics of Living Cells]  Yet, small as it is, the cell exhibits all of the customary phenomena of independent life; that is to say, it nourishes itself, it grows, it reproduces its kind, it moves about, and _it feels_. It is a _living, breathing, feeling, moving, feeding thing_.  The term \"cell\" suggests a walled-in enclosure. This is because it was originally supposed that a confining wall or membrane was an invariable and essential characteristic of cell structure. It is now known, however, that while such a membrane may exist, as it does in most plant cells, it may be lacking, as is the case in most animal cells.  The only absolutely essential parts of the cell are the inner _nucleus_ or kernel and the tiny mass of living jelly surrounding it, called the _protoplasm_.  [Sidenote: The Brain of the Cell]  The most powerful microscopes disclose in this protoplasm a certain definite structure, a very fine, thread-like network spreading from the nucleus throughout the semi-fluid albuminous protoplasm. It is certainly in line with the broad analogies of life, to suppose that in each cell the nucleus with its network is the brain and nervous system of that individual cell._  All living organisms consist, then simply of cells. Those consisting of but one cell are termed unicellular; those comprising more than one cell are called pluricellular.  The unicellular organism is the unit of life on this earth. Yet tiny and ultimate as it is, every unicellular organism is possessed of an independent and \"free living\" existence.  [Sidenote: Mind Life of One Cell]  To be convinced of this fact, just consider for a moment the scope of development and range of activities of one of these tiny bodies.  \"We see, then,\" says Haeckel, \"that it performs all the essential life functions which the entire organism accomplishes. Every one of these little beings grows and feeds itself independently. It assimilates juices from without, absorbing them from the surrounding fluid. Each separate cell is also able to reproduce itself and to increase. This increase generally takes place by simple division, the nucleus parting first, by a contraction round its circumference, into two parts; after which the protoplasm likewise separates into two divisions. The single cell is able to move and creep about; from its outer surface it sends out and draws back again finger-like processes, thereby modifying its form. Finally, the young cell has feeling, and is more or less sensitive. It performs certain movements on the application of chemical and mechanical irritants.\"  [Sidenote: The Will of the Cell]  The single living cell moves about in search of food. When food is found it is enveloped in the mass of protoplasm, digested and assimilated.  The single cell has the _power of choice_, for it refuses to eat what is unwholesome and extends itself mightily to reach that which is nourishing.  [Sidenote: The Cell and Organic Evolution]  Moebius and Gates are convinced that the single cell possesses _memory_, for having once encountered anything dangerous, it knows enough to avoid it when presented under similar circumstances. And having once found food in a certain place, it will afterwards make a business of looking for it in the same place.  And, finally, Verw√∂rn and Binet have found in a single living cell manifestations of _the emotions of surprise and fear_ and the rudiments of _an ability to adapt means to an end_.  Let us now consider pluricellular organisms and consider them particularly from the standpoint of organic evolution. The pluricellular organism is nothing more nor less than a later development, a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13791"],["title","Psychology and Achievement (#5)"],["body","association of unicellular organisms. Mark the development of such an association.  [Sidenote: Evolutionary Differentiation]  Originally each separate cell performed all the functions of a separate life. The bonds that united it to its fellows were of the most transient character. Gradually the necessities of environment led to a more and more permanent grouping, until at last the bonds of union became indissoluble.  Meanwhile, the great laws of \"adaptation\" and \"heredity,\" the basic principles of evolution, have been steadily at work, and slowly there has come about a differentiation of cell function, an apportionment among the different cells of the different kinds of labor.  [Sidenote: Plurality of the Individual]  As the result of such differentiation, the pluricellular organism, as it comes ultimately to be evolved, is composed of many different kinds of cells. Each has its special function. Each has its field of labor. Each lives its own individual life. Each reproduces its own kind. Yet all are bound together as elements of the same \"cell society\" or organized \"cell state.\"  Among pluricellular organisms man is of course supreme. He is the one form of animal life that is most highly differentiated.  [Sidenote: Combined Consciousness of the Millions]  Knowing what you now know of microscopic anatomy, you cannot hold to the simple idea that the human body is a single life-unit. This is the na√Øve belief that is everywhere current among men today. Inquire among your own friends and acquaintances and you will find that not one in a thousand realizes that he is, to put it jocularly, singularly plural, that he is in fact an assemblage of individuals.  [Illustration: MICROSCOPIC STUDIES IN HUMAN ANATOMY, PRIVATE LABORATORY, SOCIETY OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY]  Not only is the living human body as a whole alive, but \"every part of it as large as a pin-point is alive, with a separate and independent life all its own; every part of the brain, lungs, heart, muscles, fat and skin.\" No man ever has or ever can count the number of these parts or cells, some of which are so minute that it would take thousands in a row to reach an inch.  \"Feeling\" or \"consciousness\" is the sum total of the feelings and consciousness of millions of cells, just as an orchestral harmony is a composite of the sounds of all the individual instruments.  [Sidenote: Evolution of the Human Organism]  In the ancient dawn of evolution, all the cells of the human body were of the same kind. But Nature is everywhere working out problems of economy and efficiency. And, to meet the necessities of environment, there has gradually come about a parceling out among the different cells of the various tasks that all had been previously called upon to perform for the support of the human institution.  This differentiation in kinds of work has gradually brought about corresponding and appropriate changes of structure in the cells themselves, whereby each has become better fitted to perform its part in the sustenance and growth of the body.  [Sidenote: The Crowd-Man]  When you come to think that these processes of adaptation and heredity in the human body have been going on for _countless millions of years_, you can readily understand how it is that the human body of today is made up of more than thirty different kinds of cells, each having its special function.  [Sidenote: Functions of Different Human Cells]  We have muscle cells, with long, thin bodies like pea-pods, who devote their lives to the business of contraction; thin, hair-like connective tissue cells, whose office is to form a tough tissue for binding the parts of the body together; bone cells, a trades-union of masons, whose life work it is to select and assimilate salts of lime for the upkeep of the joints and framework; hair, skin, and nail cells, in various shapes and sizes, all devoting themselves to the protection and ornamentation of the body; gland cells, who give their lives, a force of trained chemists, to the abstraction from the blood of those substances that are needed for digestion; blood cells, crowding their way through the arteries, some making regular deliveries of provisions to the other tenants, some soldierly fellows patrolling their beats to repel invading disease germs, some serving as humble scavengers; liver cells engaged in the menial service of living off the waste of other organs and at the same time converting it into such fluids as are required for digestion; windpipe and lung cells, whose heads are covered with stiff hairs, which the cell throughout its life waves incessantly to and fro; and, lastly, and most important and of greatest interest to us, brain and nerve cells, the brain cells constituting altogether the organ of objective intelligence, the instrument through which we are conscious of the external world, and the nerve cells serving as a living telegraph to relay information, from one part of the body to another, with the \"swiftness of thought.\"  Says one writer, referring to the cells of the inner or true skin: \"As we look at them arranged there like a row of bricks, let us remember two things: first, that this row is actually in our skin at this moment; and, secondly, that each cell is a living being--it is born, grows, lives, breathes, eats, works, decays and dies. A gay time of it these youngsters have on the very banks of a stream that is bringing down to them every minute stores of fresh air in the round, red corpuscles of the blood, and a constant stream of suitable food in the serum. But it is not all pleasure, for every one of them is hard at work.\"  [Sidenote: Cell Life After Death]  And again, speaking of the cells that line the air-tubes, he says: \"The whole interior, then, of the air-tubes resembles nothing so much as a field of corn swayed by the wind to and fro, the principal sweep, however, being always upwards towards the throat. All particles of dust and dirt inhaled drop on this waving forest of hairs, and are gently passed up and from one to another out of the lungs. When we remember that these hairs commenced waving at our birth, and have never for one second ceased since, and will continue to wave a short time after our death, we are once more filled with wonder at the marvels that surround us on every side.\"  [Sidenote: Experiments of Dr. Alexis Carrel]  Remarkable confirmatory evidence of the fact that every organ of the body is composed of individual cell intelligences, endowed with an instinctive knowledge of how to perform their special functions, is found in the experiments of Dr. Alexis Carrel, the recipient of the Nobel prize for science for 1912.  _Dr. Carrel has taken hearts, stomachs and kidneys out of living animals, and by artificial nourishment has succeeded in keeping them steadily at work digesting foods, and so on, in his laboratory, for months after the death of the bodies from which they were originally taken._  [Sidenote: Man-Federation of Intelligences]  We see, then, that every human body is an exceedingly complex association of units. It is a marvelously correlated and organized community of countless microscopic organisms. It is a sort of _cell republic_, as to which we may truthfully paraphrase: Life and Union, One and Inseparable.  Every human body is thus made up of countless cellular intelligences, each of which instinctively utilizes ways and means for the performance of its special functions and the reproduction of its kind. These cell intelligences carry on, without the knowledge or volition of our central consciousness--that is to say, _subconsciously_--the vital operations of the body.  [Sidenote: Creative Power of the Cell]  Under normal conditions, conditions of health, each cell does its work without regard to the operations of its neighbors. But in the event of accident or disease, it is called upon to repair the organism. And in this it shows an energy and intelligence that \"savor of creative power.\" With what promptness and vigor the cells apply themselves to heal a cut or mend a broken bone! In such cases all that the physician can do is to establish outward conditions that will favor the co-operative labors of these tiny intelligences.  _The conclusion to be drawn from all this is obvious. For, if every individual and ultimate part of the body is a mind organism, it is very apparent that the body as a whole is peculiarly adapted to control and direction by mental influences.  [Sidenote: Laying the Foundation for Practical Doing]  Do not lose sight of the fact that in proving such control we are laying the foundation for a scientific method of achieving practical success in life, since all human achievement comes about through some form of bodily activity._  We assume now your complete acceptance of the following propositions, based as they are upon facts long since discovered and enunciated in standard scientific works:  _a_. The whole body is composed of cells, each of which is an intelligent entity endowed with mental powers commensurate with its needs.  [Sidenote: Three New Propositions]  _b._ The fact that every cell in the body is a _mind_ cell shows that the body, by the very nature of its component parts, is peculiarly susceptible to mental influence and control.  To these propositions we now append the following:  _c._ A further examination of the body reveals a central mental organism, the brain, composed of highly differentiated cells whose intelligence, as in the case of other cells, is commensurate with their functions.  _d._ It reveals also a physical mechanism, the nervous system, peculiarly adapted to the communication of intelligence between the central governing intelligence and the subordinate cells.  [Sidenote: An Instrument for Mental Dominance]  _e._ The existence of this mind organism and this mechanism of intercommunication is additional evidence of the control and direction of bodily activities by _mental energy_.  The facts to follow will not only demonstrate the truth of "]]]
