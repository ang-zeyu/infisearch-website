I am a graduate of the Peabody Institute, of Baltimore, where     I was thoroughly instructed in instrumental and vocal music.      I refer by permission to Mrs. A.J. Davis, 1922 Walnut Street;     Mrs. Franklin Hill, 2021 Spring Garden Street, and Mrs.     William Murray, 1819 Spruce Street, in whose families I have     given lessons.

Madam:      Having seen your advertisement for a cook in to-day's Times,     I beg to offer myself for your place. I am a thorough cook. I     can make clear soups, entrees, jellies, and all kinds of made     dishes. I can bake, and am also used to a dairy. My wages are     $4 per week, and I can give good reference from my last place,     in which I lived for two years. I am thirty-three years of     age.

Haight,     President Board of Trustees, etc.      Dear Sir: I take pleasure in recommending to your favorable     consideration the application of Miss Hannah Alexander for the     position of teacher in the public school at Weymouth.      Miss Alexander is a graduate of the Davidson Seminary, and for     the past year has taught a school in this place. My children     have been among her pupils, and their progress has been     entirely satisfactory to me.      Miss Alexander is a strict disciplinarian, an excellent     teacher, and is thoroughly competent to conduct the school for     which she applies.      Trusting that you may see fit to bestow upon her the     appointment she seeks, I am.      Yours very respectfully,     ALICE MILLER.   _5.--A Business Introduction._      J.W. Brown, Earlville, Ill.     Chicago, Ill., May 1st, 1915      My Dear Sir: This will introduce to you Mr. William Channing,     of this city, who visits Earlville on a matter of business,     which he will explain to you in person. You can rely upon his     statements, as he is a gentleman of high character, and should     you be able to render him any assistance, it would be greatly     appreciated by      Yours truly,     HAIGHT LARABEE.   _6.--Introducing One Lady to Another._      Dundee, Tenn., May 5th, 1894.      Dear Mary:      Allow me to introduce to you my ever dear friend, Miss Nellie     Reynolds, the bearer of this letter. You have heard me speak     of her so often that you will know at once who she is. As I     am sure you will be mutually pleased with each other, I have     asked her to inform you of her presence in your city. Any     attention you may show her will be highly appreciated by      Yours affectionately,     LIZZIE EICHER.   _7.--To a Lady, Apologizing for a Broken Engagement._      Albany, N.Y., May 10th, 1894.      My Dear Miss Lee:      Permit me to explain my failure to keep my appointment with     you this evening. I was on my way to your house, with the     assurance of a pleasant evening, when unfortunately I was very     unexpectedly called from home on very important business.      I regret my disappointment, but hope that the future may     afford us many pleasant meetings.      Sincerely your friend,     IRVING GOODRICH.   _8.--Form of an Excuse for a Pupil._      Thursday Morning, April 4th      Mr. Bunnel:      You will please excuse William for non-attendance at school     yesterday, as I was compelled to keep him at home to attend to     a matter of business. MRS. A. SMITH.   _9.--Form of Letter Accompanying a Present._      Louisville, July 6, 1895      My Dearest Nelly:      Many happy returns of the day. So fearful was I that it would     escape your memory, that I thought I would send you this     little trinket by way of reminder, I beg you to accept it and     wear it for the sake of the giver. With love and best wishes.      Believe me ever, your sincere friend,     CAROLINE COLLINS.   _10.--Returning Thanks for the Present._      Louisville, July 6, 1894.      Dear Mrs. Collins:      I am very much obliged to you for the handsome bracelet     you have sent me. How kind and thoughtful it was of you to     remember me on my birthday. I am sure I have every cause to     bless the day, and did I forget it, I have many kind friends     to remind me of it. Again thanking you for your present, which     is far too beautiful for me, and also for your kind wishes.      Believe me, your most grateful,     BERTHA SMITH.   _11.--Congratulating a Friend Upon His Marriage._      Menton, N.Y., May 24th, 1894.      My Dear Everett:      I have, to-day received the invitation to your wedding, and     as I cannot be present at that happy event to offer my     congratulations in person, I write.      I am heartily glad you are going to be married, and     congratulate you upon the wisdom of your choice. You have won     a noble as well as a beautiful woman, and one whose love will     make you a happy man to your life's end. May God grant that     trouble may not come near you but should it be your lot, you     will have a wife to whom you can look with confidence for     comfort, and whose good sense and devotion to you will be your     sure and unfailing support.      That you may both be very happy, and that your happiness may     increase with your years, is the prayer of      Your Friend, FRANK HOWARD.          *       *       *       *       *  LETTER WRITING.   Any extravagant flattery should be avoided, both as tending to disgust those to whom it is addressed, as well as to degrade the writers, and to create suspicion as to their sincerity. The sentiments should spring from the tenderness of the heart, and, when faithfully and delicately expressed, will never be read without exciting sympathy or emotion in all hearts not absolutely deadened by insensibility.   DECLARATION OF AFFECTION.      Dear Nellie: Will you allow me, in a few plain and simple     words, respectfully to express the sincere esteem and     affection I entertain for you, and to ask whether I may     venture to hope that these sentiments are returned? I love     you truly and earnestly and knowing you admire frankness     and candor in all things, I cannot think that you will take     offense at this letter. Perhaps it is self-flattery to suppose     I have any place in your regard. Should this be so, the error     will carry with it its own punishment, for my happy dream will     be over. I will try to think otherwise, however, and shall     await your answer with hope. Trusting soon to hear from you, I     remain, dear Nellie.      Sincerely Yours,     J.L. Master      To Miss Nellie Reynolds,     Hartford, Conn.

I love you so much that I cannot find words in     which to express my feelings. I have loved you from the very     first day we met, and always shall. Do you blame me because I     write so freely? I should be unworthy of you if I did not tell     you the whole truth. Oh, Laura, can you love me in return?     I am sure I shall not be able to bear it if your answer is     unfavorable. I will study your every wish if you will give     me the right to do so. May I hope? Send just one kind word to     your sincere friend.      HARRY SMITH.   _13.--A Lover's Good-bye Before Starting on a Journey._      Pearl St., New York, March 11th, 1894.      My Dearest Nellie: I am off to-morrow, and yet not altogether,     for I leave my heart behind in your gentle keeping. You need     not place a guard over it, however, for it is as impossible     that it should stay away, as for a bit of steel to rush from a     magnet. The simile is eminently correct for you, my dear girl,     are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I shall     make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour,     not a minute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh,     this business; but I wont complain, for we must have something     for our hive besides honey--something that rhymes with it--and     that we must have it, I must bestir myself. You will find me     a faithful correspondent. Like the spider, I shall drop a line     by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me letter for     letter. I can't give you credit. Your returns must be prompt     and punctual.      Passionately yours,     LEWIS SHUMAN.      To Miss Nellie Carter,     No. -- Fifth Avenue, New York.   _14.--From an Absent Lover._      Chicago, Ill., Sept. 10, 1915      My Dearest Kate: This sheet of paper, though I should cover     it with loving words, could never tell you truly how I long     to see you again. Time does not run on with me now at the     same pace as with other people; the hours seem days, the days     weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith in the     accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in     clairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder     if you are as impatient to see me as I am to fly to you?     Sometimes it seems as if I must leave business and every     thing else to the Fates, and take the first train to Dawson.     However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and     in a few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you     as frequently as possible in the meantime. Tell me of your     health, your "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],["title","Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#8)"],["body","and your affections.      Remember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.      Unchangeably yours,     WILLIAM MILLER.      To Miss Kate Martin,     Dawson, N.D.   _15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight._      Waterford, Maine, May 8th, 1915      Dear Miss Searles:      Although I have been in your society but once the impression     you have made upon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot     forbear writing to you, in defiance of all rules of etiquette.     Affection is sometimes of slow growth but sometimes it springs     up in a moment. In half an hour after I was introduced to you     my heart was no longer my own, I have not the assurance     to suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any     interest in yours; but will you allow me to cultivate your     acquaintance in the hope or being able to win your regard in     the course of time? Petitioning for a few lines in reply.      I remain, dear Miss Searles,     Yours devotedly,     E.C. NICKS.      Miss E. Searles,     Waterford, Maine.   _16.--Proposing Marriage._      Wednesday, October 20th, 1894      Dearest Etta:      The delightful hours I have passed in your society have left     an impression on my mind that is altogether indelible,     and cannot be effaced even by time itself. The frequent     opportunities I have possessed, of observing the thousand acts     of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your     life, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into     a passion at once ardent and sincere until I have at length     associated my hopes of future happiness with the idea of you     as a life partner, in them. Believe me, dearest Etta, this is     no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a long and warmly     cherished admiration of your many charms of person and mind.     It is love--pure devoted love, and I feel confident that your     knowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives     to their true source.      May I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should     this avowal of my fervent and honorable passion for you     be crowned with your acceptance and approval, to grant me     permission to refer the matter to your parents. Anxiously     awaiting your answer,      I am, dearest Etta,     Your sincere and faithful lover,     GEO. COURTRIGHT.      To Miss Etta Jay,     Malden, Ill.   _17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._      Philadelphia, May 10th, 1915      My Dear Mrs. Freeman:      I am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the     profound impression which your amiable qualities, intelligence     and personal attractions have made upon my heart, and as you     nave not repelled my attentions nor manifested displeasure     when I ventured to hint at the deep interest I felt in your     welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that you will     receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and     favorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings     I entertain for you in such words as should make my pleadings     irresistible; but, after all, what could I say, more than you     are very dear to me, and that the most earnest desire of my     soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife? Do     you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in     suspense, for you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment     with sincerity like mine. Awaiting your answer,      I remain with respectful affection,     Ever yours,     HENRY MURRAY.      Mrs. Julia Freeman,     Philadelphia.   _18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._      Dear Harry:      It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which     has given me great pain, and upon which silence has become     impossible if I would preserve my self-respects. You cannot     but be aware that I have just reason for saying that you have     much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten what is due     to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot     suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by     conduct toward other ladies from which I should naturally     have the right to expect you to abstain. I am not so vulgar a     person as to be jealous. When there is cause to infer changed     feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy, jealousy     is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both     of us have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me     that we must come to some understanding by which the future     shall be governed. Neither you nor I can bear a divided     allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow than     in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps     thoughtlessly. But it will take much to reassure me of your     unaltered regard.      Yours truly,     EMMA.  [Illustration: HEALTHFUL OUTDOOR EXERCISE.]  [Illustration: THE HUMAN FACE, LIKE A FLOWER, SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.]          *       *       *       *       *  HINTS AND HELPS ON GOOD BEHAVIOR AT ALL TIMES AND AT ALL PLACES.   1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness prepares the way. Indeed, as ontaigne [Transcriber's note: Montaigne?] says, Courtesy begets esteem at sight. Urbanity is half of affability, and affability is a charm worth possessing.  2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs the Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are circumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under the little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul standard.  3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\" and Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of rectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure and kind heart are elements of nobility which will work out in the life of a human being at home--everywhere. \"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"  4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment. Remember that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you are ruined.  5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine spirit begets cheer and hope.  6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.  7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and good expression; they will yield perpetual interest.  8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local occurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.  9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much awkwardness--with a constant aim to make others happy. Remember that it is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.  10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking: Head erect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary motion about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deforming and therefore unhealthful.  11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.  12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the are should be limited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they almost touch the clothing.  13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost say, forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails, cordial and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose of attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.  14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point elsewhere, as a rule.  15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and smile, as you speak.  16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any circumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.  17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in mind your own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws of society, and bow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all woman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitterness of flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember ever that painful prediscovery is better than later disappointment. Let such experience spur you to higher exertion.  18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two gentlemen who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is the one to whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals, if one be a stranger in the place his name should be mentioned first.  19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.  20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is entitled to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the one to whom the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss A, permit me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A., allow me to introduce Mr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say simply, \"Miss A. Mr. B.\"  21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment, \"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I am pleased to meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped expressions should always be used, but something similar is expected. Do not extend the hand usually.  22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards gentlemen. A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to address her by her home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title Miss and Mr. respectively.  23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but never gushing.  24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it is polite to bow slightly each time after the first.  25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight acquaintance will make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too slight or stiff.  26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that she is feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.  27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she expects to meet a gentleman"]]]
