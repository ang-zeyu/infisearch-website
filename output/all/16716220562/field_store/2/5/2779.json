Beneath some patriarchal tree     I lay upon the ground; His hoary arms uplifted he, And all the broad leaves over me Clapped their little hands in glee,     With one continuous sound;—  A slumberous sound, a sound that brings     The feelings of a dream, As of innumerable wings, As, when a bell no longer swings, Faint the hollow murmur rings     O’er meadow, lake, and stream.  And dreams of that which cannot die,     Bright visions, came to me, As lapped in thought I used to lie, And gaze into the summer sky, Where the sailing clouds went by,     Like ships upon the sea;  Dreams that the soul of youth engage     Ere Fancy has been quelled; Old legends of the monkish page, Traditions of the saint and sage, Tales that have the rime of age,     And chronicles of Eld.  And, loving still these quaint old themes,     Even in the city’s throng I feel the freshness of the streams, That, crossed by shades and sunny gleams, Water the green land of dreams,     The holy land of song.  Therefore, at Pentecost, which brings     The Spring, clothed like a bride, When nestling buds unfold their wings, And bishop’s-caps have golden rings, Musing upon many things,     I sought the woodlands wide.  The green trees whispered low and mild;     It was a sound of joy! They were my playmates when a child, And rocked me in their arms so wild! Still they looked at me and smiled,     As if I were a boy;  And ever whispered, mild and low,     “Come, be a child once more!” And waved their long arms to and fro, And beckoned solemnly and slow; O, I could not choose but go     Into the woodlands hoar,—  Into the blithe and breathing air,     Into the solemn wood, Solemn and silent everywhere Nature with folded hands seemed there Kneeling at her evening prayer!     Like one in prayer I stood.  Before me rose an avenue     Of tall and sombrous pines; Abroad their fan-like branches grew, And, where the sunshine darted through, Spread a vapor soft and blue,     In long and sloping lines.  And, falling on my weary brain,     Like a fast-falling shower, The dreams of youth came back again, Low lispings of the summer rain, Dropping on the ripened grain,     As once upon the flower.  Visions of childhood! Stay, O stay!     Ye were so sweet and wild! And distant voices seemed to say, “It cannot be! They pass away! Other themes demand thy lay;     Thou art no more a child!  “The land of Song within thee lies,     Watered by living springs; The lids of Fancy’s sleepless eyes Are gates unto that Paradise, Holy thoughts, like stars, arise,     Its clouds are angels’ wings.  “Learn, that henceforth thy song shall be,     Not mountains capped with snow, Nor forests sounding like the sea, Nor rivers flowing ceaselessly, Where the woodlands bend to see     The bending heavens below.  “There is a forest where the din     Of iron branches sounds! A mighty river roars between, And whosoever looks therein Sees the heavens all black with sin,     Sees not its depths, nor bounds.  “Athwart the swinging branches cast,     Soft rays of sunshine pour; Then comes the fearful wintry blast Our hopes, like withered leaves, fail fast; Pallid lips say, ‘It is past!     We can return no more!’  “Look, then, into thine heart, and write!     Yes, into Life’s deep stream! All forms of sorrow and delight, All solemn Voices of the Night, That can soothe thee, or affright,—     Be these henceforth thy theme.”     HYMN TO THE NIGHT   Ἀσπασίη, τρίλλιστος  I heard the trailing garments of the Night     Sweep through her marble halls! I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light     From the celestial walls!  I felt her presence, by its spell of might,     Stoop o’er me from above; The calm, majestic presence of the Night,     As of the one I love.  I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,     The manifold, soft chimes, That fill the haunted chambers of the Night     Like some old poet’s rhymes.  From the cool cisterns of the midnight air     My spirit drank repose; The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,—     From those deep cisterns flows.  O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear     What man has borne before! Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,     And they complain no more.  Peace! Peace! Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!     Descend with broad-winged flight, The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,     The best-beloved Night!     A PSALM OF LIFE. WHAT THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN SAID TO THE PSALMIST.  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,     Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers,     And things are not what they seem.  Life is real! Life is earnest!     And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest,     Was not spoken of the soul.  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,     Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrow     Find us farther than to-day.  Art is long, and Time is fleeting,     And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still, like muffled drums, are beating     Funeral marches to the grave.  In the world’s broad field of battle,     In the bivouac of Life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle!     Be a hero in the strife!  Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!     Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,—act in the living Present!     Heart within, and God o’erhead!  Lives of great men all remind us     We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us     Footprints on the sands of time;—  Footprints, that perhaps another,     Sailing o’er life’s solemn main, A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,     Seeing, shall take heart again.  Let us, then, be up and doing,     With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing,     Learn to labor and to wait.    THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.  There is a Reaper, whose name is Death,   And, with his sickle keen, He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,   And the flowers that grow between.  \"Shall I have naught that is fair?\" saith he;   \"Have naught but the bearded grain? Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,   I will give them all back again.\"  He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,   He kissed their drooping leaves; It was for the Lord of Paradise   He bound them in his sheaves.  \"My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,\"   The Reaper said, and smiled; \"Dear tokens of the earth are they,   Where he was once a child.  \"They shall all bloom in fields of light,   Transplanted by my care, And saints, upon their garments white,   These sacred blossoms wear.\"  And the mother gave, in tears and pain,   The flowers she most did love; She knew she should find them all again   In the fields of light above.  O, not in cruelty, not in wrath,   The Reaper came that day; 'T was an angel visited the green earth,   And took the flowers away.    THE LIGHT OF STARS.  The night is come, but not too soon;   And sinking silently, All silently, the little moon   Drops down behind the sky.  There is no light in earth or heaven   But the cold light of stars; And the first watch of night is given   To the red planet Mars.  Is it the tender star of love?   The star of love and dreams? O no! from that blue tent above,   A hero's armor gleams.  And earnest thoughts within me rise,   When I behold afar, Suspended in the evening skies,   The shield of that red star.  O star of strength! I see thee stand   And smile upon my pain; Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand,   And I am strong again.  Within my breast there is no light   But the cold light of stars; I give the first watch of the night   To the red planet Mars.  The star of the unconquered will,   He rises in my breast, Serene, and resolute, and still,   And calm, and self-possessed.  And thou, too, whosoe'er thou art,   That readest this brief psalm, As one by one thy hopes depart,   Be resolute and calm.  O fear not in a world like this,   And thou shalt know erelong, Know how sublime a thing it is   To suffer and be strong.    FOOTSTEPS OF ANGELS.  When the hours of Day are numbered,   And the voices of the Night Wake the better soul, that slumbered,   To a holy, calm delight;  Ere the evening lamps are lighted,   And, like phantoms grim and tall, Shadows from the fitful firelight   Dance upon the parlor wall;  Then the forms of the departed   Enter at the open door; The beloved, the true-hearted,   Come to visit me once more;  He, the young and strong, who cherished   Noble longings for the strife, By the roadside fell and perished,   Weary with the march of life!  They, the holy ones and weakly,   Who the cross of suffering bore, Folded their pale hands so meekly,   Spake with us on earth no more!  And with them the Being Beauteous,   Who unto my youth was given, More than all things else to love me,   And is now a saint in heaven.  With a slow and noiseless footstep   Comes that messenger divine, Takes the vacant chair beside me,   Lays her gentle hand in mine.  And she sits and gazes at me   With those deep and tender eyes, Like the stars, so still and saint-like,   Looking downward from the skies.  Uttered not, yet comprehended,   Is the spirit's voiceless prayer, Soft rebukes, in blessings ended,   Breathing from her lips of air.  Oh, though oft depressed and lonely,   All my fears are laid aside, If I but remember only   Such as these have lived and died!    FLOWERS.  Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,   One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine, When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,   Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.  Stars they are, wherein we read our history,   As astrologers and seers of eld; Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery,   Like the burning stars, which they beheld.  Wondrous truths, and manifold as wondrous,   God hath written in those stars above; But not less in the bright flowerets under us   Stands the revelation of his love.  Bright and glorious is that revelation,   Written all over this great world of ours; Making evident our own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1365"],["title","The Complete Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (#3)"],["body","ion,   In these stars of earth, these golden flowers.  And the Poet, faithful and far-seeing,   Sees, alike in stars and flowers, a part Of the self-same, universal being,   Which is throbbing in his brain and heart.  Gorgeous flowerets in the sunlight shining,   Blossoms flaunting in the eye of day, Tremulous leaves, with soft and silver lining,   Buds that open only to decay;  Brilliant hopes, all woven in gorgeous tissues,   Flaunting gayly in the golden light; Large desires, with most uncertain issues,   Tender wishes, blossoming at night!  These in flowers and men are more than seeming;   Workings are they of the self-same powers, Which the Poet, in no idle dreaming,   Seeth in himself and in the flowers.  Everywhere about us are they glowing,   Some like stars, to tell us Spring is born; Others, their blue eyes with tears o'er-flowing,   Stand like Ruth amid the golden corn;  Not alone in Spring's armorial bearing,   And in Summer's green-emblazoned field, But in arms of brave old Autumn's wearing,   In the centre of his brazen shield;  Not alone in meadows and green alleys,   On the mountain-top, and by the brink Of sequestered pools in woodland valleys,   Where the slaves of nature stoop to drink;  Not alone in her vast dome of glory,   Not on graves of bird and beast alone, But in old cathedrals, high and hoary,   On the tombs of heroes, carved in stone;  In the cottage of the rudest peasant,   In ancestral homes, whose crumbling towers, Speaking of the Past unto the Present,   Tell us of the ancient Games of Flowers;  In all places, then, and in all seasons,   Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings, Teaching us, by most persuasive reasons,   How akin they are to human things.  And with childlike, credulous affection   We behold their tender buds expand; Emblems of our own great resurrection,   Emblems of the bright and better land.    THE BELEAGUERED CITY.  I have read, in some old, marvellous tale,   Some legend strange and vague, That a midnight host of spectres pale   Beleaguered the walls of Prague.  Beside the Moldau's rushing stream,   With the wan moon overhead, There stood, as in an awful dream,   The army of the dead.  White as a sea-fog, landward bound,   The spectral camp was seen, And, with a sorrowful, deep sound,   The river flowed between.  No other voice nor sound was there,   No drum, nor sentry's pace; The mist-like banners clasped the air,   As clouds with clouds embrace.  But when the old cathedral bell   Proclaimed the morning prayer, The white pavilions rose and fell   On the alarmed air.  Down the broad valley fast and far   The troubled army fled; Up rose the glorious morning star,   The ghastly host was dead.  I have read, in the marvellous heart of man,   That strange and mystic scroll, That an army of phantoms vast and wan   Beleaguer the human soul.  Encamped beside Life's rushing stream,   In Fancy's misty light, Gigantic shapes and shadows gleam   Portentous through the night.  Upon its midnight battle-ground   The spectral camp is seen, And, with a sorrowful, deep sound,   Flows the River of Life between.  No other voice nor sound is there,   In the army of the grave; No other challenge breaks the air,   But the rushing of Life's wave.  And when the solemn and deep churchbell   Entreats the soul to pray, The midnight phantoms feel the spell,   The shadows sweep away.  Down the broad Vale of Tears afar   The spectral camp is fled; Faith shineth as a morning star,   Our ghastly fears are dead.    MIDNIGHT MASS FOR THE DYING YEAR  Yes, the Year is growing old,   And his eye is pale and bleared! Death, with frosty hand and cold,   Plucks the old man by the beard,        Sorely, sorely!  The leaves are falling, falling,   Solemnly and slow; Caw! caw! the rooks are calling,   It is a sound of woe,        A sound of woe!  Through woods and mountain passes   The winds, like anthems, roll; They are chanting solemn masses,   Singing, \"Pray for this poor soul,        Pray, pray!\"  And the hooded clouds, like friars,   Tell their beads in drops of rain, And patter their doleful prayers;   But their prayers are all in vain,        All in vain!  There he stands in the foul weather,   The foolish, fond Old Year, Crowned with wild flowers and with heather,     Like weak, despised Lear,        A king, a king!  Then comes the summer-like day,   Bids the old man rejoice! His joy! his last!  O, the man gray   Loveth that ever-soft voice,        Gentle and low.  To the crimson woods he saith,   To the voice gentle and low Of the soft air, like a daughter's breath,   \"Pray do not mock me so!        Do not laugh at me!\"  And now the sweet day is dead;   Cold in his arms it lies; No stain from its breath is spread   Over the glassy skies,        No mist or stain!  Then, too, the Old Year dieth,   And the forests utter a moan, Like the voice of one who crieth   In the wilderness alone,        \"Vex not his ghost!\"  Then comes, with an awful roar,   Gathering and sounding on, The storm-wind from Labrador,   The wind Euroclydon,         The storm-wind!  Howl! howl! and from the forest   Sweep the red leaves away! Would, the sins that thou abhorrest,   O Soul! could thus decay,        And be swept away! For there shall come a mightier blast,   There shall be a darker day;  And the stars, from heaven down-cast   Like red leaves be swept away!        Kyrie, eleyson!        Christe, eleyson!  **********  EARLIER POEMS  AN APRIL DAY      When the warm sun, that brings Seed-time and harvest, has returned again, 'T is sweet to visit the still wood, where springs     The first flower of the plain.      I love the season well, When forest glades are teeming with bright forms, Nor dark and many-folded clouds foretell     The coming-on of storms.      From the earth's loosened mould The sapling draws its sustenance, and thrives; Though stricken to the heart with winter's cold,     The drooping tree revives.      The softly-warbled song Comes from the pleasant woods, and colored wings Glance quick in the bright sun, that moves along     The forest openings.      When the bright sunset fills The silver woods with light, the green slope throws Its shadows in the hollows of the hills,     And wide the upland glows.      And when the eve is born, In the blue lake the sky, o'er-reaching far, Is hollowed out and the moon dips her horn,     And twinkles many a star.      Inverted in the tide Stand the gray rocks, and trembling shadows throw, And the fair trees look over, side by side,     And see themselves below.      Sweet April! many a thought Is wedded unto thee, as hearts are wed; Nor shall they fail, till, to its autumn brought,     Life's golden fruit is shed.    AUTUMN  With what a glory comes and goes the year! The buds of spring, those beautiful harbingers Of sunny skies and cloudless times, enjoy Life's newness, and earth's garniture spread out; And when the silver habit of the clouds Comes down upon the autumn sun, and with A sober gladness the old year takes up His bright inheritance of golden fruits, A pomp and pageant fill the splendid scene.    There is a beautiful spirit breathing now Its mellow richness on the clustered trees, And, from a beaker full of richest dyes, Pouring new glory on the autumn woods, And dipping in warm light the pillared clouds. Morn on the mountain, like a summer bird, Lifts up her purple wing, and in the vales The gentle wind, a sweet and passionate wooer, Kisses the blushing leaf, and stirs up life Within the solemn woods of ash deep-crimsoned, And silver beech, and maple yellow-leaved, Where Autumn, like a faint old man, sits down By the wayside a-weary.  Through the trees The golden robin moves.  The purple finch, That on wild cherry and red cedar feeds, A winter bird, comes with its plaintive whistle, And pecks by the witch-hazel, whilst aloud From cottage roofs the warbling blue-bird sings, And merrily, with oft-repeated stroke, Sounds from the threshing-floor the busy flail.    O what a glory doth this world put on For him who, with a fervent heart, goes forth Under the bright and glorious sky, and looks On duties well performed, and days well spent! For him the wind, ay, and the yellow leaves, Shall have a voice, and give him eloquent teachings. He shall so hear the solemn hymn that Death Has lifted up for all, that he shall go To his long resting-place without a tear.    WOODS IN WINTER.  When winter winds are piercing chill,   And through the hawthorn blows the gale, With solemn feet I tread the hill,   That overbrows the lonely vale.  O'er the bare upland, and away   Through the long reach of desert woods, The embracing sunbeams chastely play,   And gladden these deep solitudes.  Where, twisted round the barren oak,   The summer vine in beauty clung, And summer winds the stillness broke,   The crystal icicle is hung.  Where, from their frozen urns, mute springs   Pour out the river's gradual tide, Shrilly the skater's iron rings,   And voices fill the woodland side.  Alas! how changed from the fair scene,   When birds sang out their mellow lay, And winds were soft, and woods were green,   And the song ceased not with the day!  But still wild music is abroad,   Pale, desert woods! within your crowd; And gathering winds, in hoarse accord,   Amid the vocal reeds pipe loud.  Chill airs and wintry winds! my ear   Has grown familiar with your song; I hear it in the opening year,   I listen, and it cheers me long.    HYMN OF THE MORAVIAN NUNS OF BETHLEHEM  AT THE CONSECRATION OF PULASKI'S BANNER.  When the dying flame of day Through the chancel shot its ray, Far the glimmering tapers shed Faint light on the cowled head; And the censer burning swung, Where, before the altar, hung The crimson banner, that with prayer Had been consecrated there. And the nuns' sweet hymn was heard the while, Sung low, in the dim, mysterious aisle.     \"Take thy banner!  May it wave     Proudly o'er the good and brave;     When the battle's distant wail     Breaks the sabbath of our "]]]
