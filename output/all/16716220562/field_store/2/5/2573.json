A good many fairly sane people believe in the supernatural and devote themselves to its study--there is William James, for instance.\"  \"But William James doesn't dress in flowing robes, and worship the sun, and live with a Hindu mystic.\"  \"No,\" I smiled, \"he doesn't do that,\" and I thought again of the mysterious light and of the two white-clad figures. \"Does he live with a Hindu mystic?\"  \"Yes,\" said Swain, bitterly. \"An adept, or whatever they call it. He's the fellow who kicked me out.\"  \"Does he speak English?\"  \"Better than I do. He seems a finely-educated man.\"  \"Is he a lunatic, too?\"  Swain hesitated.  \"I don't know,\" he said, finally. \"I only saw him once, and I was certainly impressed--I wasn't one, two, three with him. I suppose mysticism comes more or less natural to a Hindu; but I'm convinced that Mr. Vaughan has softening of the brain.\"  \"How old is he?\"  \"About sixty.\"  \"Has he always been queer?\"  \"He has always been interested in telepathy and mental suggestion, and all that sort of thing. But before his wife's death, he was fairly normal. It was her death that started him on this supernatural business. He hasn't thought of anything else since.\"  \"Are there any relatives who could be asked to interfere?\"  \"None that I know of.\"  I thought over what he had told me.  \"Well,\" I said at last, \"I can see no harm in your meeting Miss Vaughan and finding out what the condition of affairs really is. If her father is really mad, he may be a good deal worse now than he was when you saw him last. It would, of course, be possible to have his sanity tested--but his daughter would scarcely wish to do that.\"  \"No, of course not,\" Swain agreed.  \"Her letter tells you nothing?\"  \"Nothing except that she is in great trouble, and wishes to see me at once.\"  \"You are to go to the house?\"  \"No; there is an arbour in one corner of the grounds. She says that she will be there at eleven-thirty every night for three nights. After that, she says it will be no use for me to come--that it will be too late.\"  \"What does she mean by 'too late'?\"  \"I have no idea,\" he answered, and turned to another anxious perusal of the letter.  I turned the situation over in my mind. Evidently Miss Vaughan believed that she had grave cause for alarm, and yet it was quite possible she might be mistaken. She was being urged to consent to something against her will, but perhaps it was for her own good. In any event, I had seen no indication that her consent was being sought by violence. There must be no interference on our part until we were surer of our ground.  \"Well, Swain,\" I said, at last, \"I will help you on one condition.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"You will meet Miss Vaughan to-night and hear her story, but you will take no action until you and I have talked the matter over. She, herself, says that she has three days,\" I went on, as he started to protest, \"so there is no necessity for leaping in the dark. And I would point out to you that she is not yet of age, but is still under her father's control.\"  \"She is nineteen,\" he protested.  \"In this state, the legal age for women, as for men, is twenty-one. The law requires a very serious reason for interfering between a child and its father. Moreover,\" I added, \"she must not be compromised. If you persuade her to accompany you to-night, where would you take her? In no case, will I be a party to an elopement--I will do all I can to prevent it.\"  He took a short turn up and down the room, his hands clenched behind him.  \"Mr. Lester,\" he said, at last, stopping before me, \"I want you to believe that I have not even thought of an elopement--that would be too base, too unfair to her. But I see that you are right. She must not be compromised.\"  \"And you promise to ask my advice?\"  \"Suppose I make such a promise, what then?\"  \"If you make such a promise, and I agree with you as to the necessity for Miss Vaughan to leave her father, I think I can arrange for her to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Royce for a time. There she will be safe. Should legal proceedings become necessary, our firm will help you. I want to help you, Swain,\" I added, warmly, \"but I must be convinced that you deserve help. That's reasonable, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" he agreed, and held out his hand. \"And I promise.\"  \"Good. And now for the arrangements.\"  Two twelve-foot ladders were necessary, one for either side of the wall; but, beyond a short step-ladder, the place possessed none except the long one by which Godfrey and I had mounted into the tree. Swain suggested that this might do for one, but I felt that it would better stay where it was, and sent Hargis over to Yonkers to buy two new ones, instructing him to bring them back with him.  Then Swain and I reconnoitred the wall, and chose for the crossing a spot where the glass escarpment seemed a little less formidable than elsewhere.  \"You can step from one ladder to the other,\" I pointed out, \"without touching the top of the wall. A mere touch would be dangerous in the dark.\"  He nodded his agreement, and finally we went back to the house. Getting there, we found suddenly that we had nothing more to say. Swain was soon deep in his own thoughts; and, I must confess, that, after the first excitement, I began to find the affair a little wearying. Another man's love-affair is usually wearying; and, besides that, the glimpse which I had caught of Marjorie Vaughan made me think that she was worthy of a bigger fish than Swain would ever be. He was right in saying that there were thousands of men who had more to give her, and who would be eager to give.  I examined Swain, as he sat there staring at nothing, with eyes not wholly friendly. He was handsome enough, but in a stereotyped way. And he was only an insignificant clerk, with small prospect of ever being anything much better, for he had started the battle of life too late. Honest, of course, honourable, clean-hearted, but commonplace, with a depth of soul easily fathomed. I know now that I was unjust to Swain, but, at the moment, my scrutiny of him left me strangely depressed.  A rattle of wheels on the drive brought us both out of our thoughts. It was Hargis returning with the ladders. I had him hang them up against the shed where he kept his gardening implements, for I did not wish him to suspect the invasion we had planned; then, just to kill time and get away from Swain, I spent an hour with Hargis in his garden; and finally came the summons to dinner. An hour later, as we sat on the front porch smoking, and still finding little or nothing to say, Mrs. Hargis came out to bid us good-night.  \"Mr. Swain can use the bedroom next to yours, Mr. Lester,\" she said.  \"Perhaps he won't stay all night,\" I said. \"If he does, I'll show him the way to it. And thank you very much, Mrs. Hargis.\"  \"Is there anything else I can do, sir?\"  \"No, thank you.\"  \"Mr. Godfrey will be here a little before midnight--at least, that's his usual time.\"  \"We'll wait up for him,\" I said. \"Good night, Mrs. Hargis.\"  \"Good night, sir,\" and she went back into the house.  I have never passed through a longer or more trying hour than the next one was, and I could tell by the way Swain twitched about in his chair that he felt the tedium as much as I. Once or twice I tried to start a conversation, but it soon trickled dry; and we ended by smoking away moodily and staring out into the darkness.  At last Swain sprang to his feet.  \"I can't stand this any longer,\" he said. \"I'm going over the wall.\"  I struck a match and looked at my watch.  \"It isn't eleven o'clock yet,\" I warned him.  \"I don't care. Perhaps she'll be ahead of time. Anyway, I might as well wait there as here.\"  \"Come on, then,\" I agreed, for I felt myself that another such hour would be unendurable.  Together we made our way back to the shed and took down the ladders. A moment later, we were at the wall. Swain placed his ladder against it, and mounted quickly to the top. As he paused there, I handed him up the other one. He caught it from my hands, lifted it over the wall, and lowered it carefully on the other side. As he did so, I heard him give a muffled exclamation of mingled pain and annoyance, and knew that he had cut himself.  \"Not bad, is it?\" I asked.  \"No; only a scratch on the wrist,\" he answered shortly, and the next instant he had swung himself over the wall and disappeared.     CHAPTER VI  THE SCREAM IN THE NIGHT   For some moments, I stood staring up into the darkness, half-expecting that shadowy figure to reappear, descend the ladder, and rejoin me. Then I shook myself together. The fact that our plot was really moving, that Swain was in the enemy's country, so to speak, gave the affair a finality which it had lacked before. It was too late now to hesitate or turn back; we must press forward. I felt as though, after a long period of uncertainty, war had been declared and the advance definitely begun. So it was with a certain sense of relief that I turned away, walked slowly back to the house, and sat down again upon the porch to wait.  Now waiting is seldom a pleasant or an easy thing, and I found it that night most unpleasant and uneasy. For, before long, doubts began to crowd upon me--doubts of the wisdom of the course I had subscribed to. It would have been wiser, I told myself, if it had been I, and not Swain, who had gone to the rendezvous; wiser still, perhaps, to have sought an interview openly, and to have made sure of the facts before seeming to encourage what might easily prove to be a girl's more or less romantic illusions. A midnight interview savoured too much of melodrama to appeal to a middle-aged lawyer like myself, however great its appeal might be to youthful lovers. At any rate, I would be certain that the need was very great before I consented to meddle"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13372"],["title","The Gloved Hand (#6)"],["body","r!  Somewhat comforted by this resolution and by the thought that no real harm had as yet been done, I struck a match and looked at my watch. It was half-past eleven. Well, whatever the story was, Swain was hearing it now, and I should hear it before long. And then I caught the hum of an approaching car, and was momentarily blinded by the glare of acetylene lamps.  \"Hello, Lester,\" called Godfrey's voice, \"I'll be back in a minute,\" and he ran the car on toward the rear of the house.  I stood up with a gasp of thankfulness. Here was someone to confide in and advise with. The stretch of lonely waiting was at an end; it had been a trying evening!  I think the warmth of my greeting surprised Godfrey, for he looked at me curiously.  \"Sit down, Godfrey,\" I said. \"I've got something to tell you.\"  \"What, discoveries already?\" he laughed, but he drew a chair close to mine and sat down. \"Well, what are they?\"  I began at the beginning and related the day's adventures. He listened without comment, but I could see how his interest grew.  \"So young Swain is over in those grounds now,\" he said thoughtfully, when I had finished.  \"Yes; he's been there three-quarters of an hour.\"  \"Why do you suppose Miss Vaughan named so late an hour?\"  \"I don't know. Perhaps because she was afraid of being discovered earlier than that--or perhaps merely because she's just a romantic girl.\"  Godfrey sat with his head bent in thought for a moment.  \"I have it!\" he said. \"At eleven-thirty every night her father and the adept go up to the roof, to remain there till midnight. That is the one time of the whole day when she is absolutely sure to be alone. Come along, Lester!\"  He was on his feet now, and his voice was quivering with excitement.  \"Where are you going?\" I asked.  \"Up the ladder. It's nearly twelve. If the star falls as usual, we'll know that everything is all right. If it doesn't ...\"  He did not finish, but hurried away among the trees. In a moment we were at the ladder; in another moment we were high among the leaves, straining our eyes through the darkness.  \"I'm going to look at my watch,\" said Godfrey, in a low voice. \"Lean back and screen me.\"  I heard the flash of the match and saw a little glare of light against the nearest leaves. Then Godfrey's voice spoke again.  \"It's three minutes of twelve,\" he said.  There was a tension in his voice which sent a shiver through me, though I understood but dimly what it was he feared. The stars were shining brightly, and once I fancied that I saw the strange star appear among them; but when I closed my eyes for an instant and looked again, it was gone. Slow minute followed minute, and the hand with which I clutched the ladder began to tremble. The sight of that mysterious light had shaken me the night before, but not half so deeply as its absence shook me now. At last the suspense grew unendurable.  \"It must be long past midnight,\" I whispered.  \"It is,\" agreed Godfrey gravely; \"we may as well go down.\"  He paused an instant longer to stare out into the darkness, then descended quickly. I followed, and found him waiting, a dark shadow. He put his hand on my arm, and stood a moment, as though in indecision. For myself, I felt as though an intolerable burden had been laid upon my shoulders.  \"Well,\" I asked, at last, \"what now?\"  \"We must see if Swain has returned,\" he answered. \"If he has, all right. If he hasn't, we'll have to go and look for him.\"  \"What is it you fear, Godfrey?\" I demanded. \"Do you think Swain's in danger?\"  \"I don't know what I fear; but there's something wrong over there. This is the first night for a week that that light hasn't appeared.\"  \"Still,\" I pointed out, \"that may have nothing to do with Swain.\"  \"No; but it's a coincidence that he should be in the grounds--and I'm always afraid of coincidences. Let us see if he is back,\" and he turned toward the house.  But I held his arm.  \"If he's back,\" I said, \"he'll have taken the ladders down from the wall.\"  \"That's true,\" and together we made our way forward among the trees. Then we reached the wall, and there was the dim white line of the ladder leaning against it. Without a word, Godfrey mounted it, stood an instant at the top, and then came down again.  \"The other ladder is still there,\" he said, and took off his cap and rubbed his head perplexedly. I could not see his face, but I could guess how tense it was. I had been with him in many trying situations, but only once before had I seen him use that gesture!  \"It won't do to alarm the house,\" he said, at last. \"Do you know where he was to meet Miss Vaughan?\"  \"At an arbour in one corner of the grounds,\" I answered.  \"Then we'll start from there and take a quiet look for him. Wait here for me a minute.\"  He melted into the darkness, and I stood holding on to the ladder as though in danger of falling, and staring at the top of the wall, where I had last seen Swain. An hour and a half had passed since then....  A touch on the arm brought me around with a start.  \"Here, put this pistol in your pocket,\" said Godfrey's voice, and I felt the weapon pressed into my hand. \"And here's an electric torch. Do you feel the button?\"  \"Yes,\" I said, and pressed it. A ray of light shot toward the wall, but I released the button instantly.  \"You'd better keep it in your hand,\" he added, \"ready for action. No telling what we'll run across. And now come ahead.\"  He put his foot on the ladder, but I stopped him.  \"Look here, Godfrey,\" I said, \"do you realise that what we're about to do is pretty serious? Swain might have a legal excuse, since the daughter of the house invited him to a meeting; but if we go over the wall, we're trespassers pure and simple. Anybody who runs across us in the darkness has the right to shoot us down without asking any questions--and we'd have no legal right to shoot back!\"  I could hear Godfrey chuckling, and I felt my cheeks redden.  \"You remind me of Tartarin,\" he said; \"the adventurer-Tartarin urging you on, the lawyer-Tartarin holding you back. My advice is to shake the lawyer, Lester. He's out of his element here to-night. But if he's too strong for you, why, stay here,\" and he started up the ladder.  Burning with vexation, I started after him, but suddenly he stopped.  \"Listen!\" he whispered.  I heard something rattle against the other side of the wall; then a dark figure appeared on the coping.  I felt Godfrey press me back, and descended cautiously. A moment later, something slid down the wall, and I knew that the person at the top had lifted the other ladder over. Then the figure descended, and then a distorted face stared into the circle of Godfrey's torch.  For a breath, I did not recognise it; then I saw that it was Swain's.  I shall never forget the shock it gave me, with its starting eyes and working mouth and smear of blood across the forehead. Godfrey, I knew, was also startled, for the light flashed out for an instant, and then flashed on again.  \"What is it, Swain?\" I cried, and seized him by the arm; but he shook me off roughly.  \"Stand back!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Who is it? What do you want?\"  \"It's Lester,\" I said, and Godfrey flashed his torch into my face, then back to Swain's.  \"But you're not alone.\"  \"No; this is Mr. Godfrey.\"  \"Mr. Godfrey?\"  \"Whose house we're staying at,\" I explained.  \"Ah!\" said Swain, and put one hand to his head and leaned heavily against the ladder.  \"I think we'd better go to the house,\" Godfrey suggested, soothingly. \"We all need a bracer. Then we can talk. Don't you think so, Mr. Swain?\"  Swain nodded vacantly, but I could see that he had not understood. His face was still working and he seemed to be in pain.  \"I want to wash,\" he said, thickly. \"I cut my wrist on that damned glass, and I'm blood all over, and my head's wrong, somehow.\" His voice trailed off into an unintelligible mumble, but he held one hand up into the circle of light, and I saw that his cuff was soaked with blood and his hand streaked with it.  \"Come along, then,\" said Godfrey peremptorily. \"You're right--that cut must be attended to,\" and he started toward the house.  \"Wait!\" Swain called after him, with unexpected vigour. \"We must take down the ladders. We mustn't leave them here.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"If they're found, they'll suspect--they'll know ...\" He stopped, stammering, and again his voice trailed away into a mumble, as though beyond his control.  Godfrey looked at him for a moment, and I could guess at the surprise and suspicion in his eyes. I myself was ill at ease, for there was something in Swain's face--a sort of vacant horror and dumb shrinking--that filled me with a vague repulsion. And then to see his jaw working, as he tried to form articulate words and could not, sent a shiver over my scalp.  \"Very well,\" Godfrey agreed, at last. \"We'll take the ladders, since you think it so important. You take that one, Lester, and I'll take this.\"  I stooped to raise the ladder to my shoulder, when suddenly, cutting the darkness like a knife, came a scream so piercing, so vibrant with fear, that I stood there crouching, every muscle rigid. Again the scream came, more poignant, more terrible, wrung from a woman's throat by the last extremity of horror; and then a silence sickening and awful. What was happening in that silence?  I stood erect, gaping, suffocated, rising as from a long submersion. Godfrey's finger had slipped from the button of his torch, and we were in darkness; but suddenly a dim figure hurled itself past us, up the ladder.  With a low cry, Godfrey snatched at it, but his hand clutched only the empty air. The next instant, the figure poised itself on the coping of the wall and then plunged forward out of sight. I heard the crash of breaking branches, a scramble, a patter of feet, and all was still.  \"It's Swain!\" said Godfrey, hoarsely; \"and that's a twelve-foot drop! Why, the man's mad! Hand me that ladder, Lester!\" he added, for he was already at the top of the wall.  I lifted it, as I had done once before"]]]
