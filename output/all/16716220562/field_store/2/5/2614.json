I would not pass another day Without this work begun.   Song 15. _Against Lying_.  1 O `tis a lovely thing for youth To walk betimes in wisdom's way; To fear a lye, to speak the truth, That we may trust to all they say.  2 But lyars we can never trust, Though they should speak the thing that's true, And he that does one fault at first, And lyes to hide it, makes it two.  3 Have we not known, nor heard, nor read, How God abhors deceit and wrong? How Ananias was struck dead Catch'd with a lye upon his tongue?  4 So did his wife Sapphira die When she came in, and grew so bold As to confirm that wicked lye That just before her husband told.  5 The Lord delights in them that speak The words of truth; but every lyar Must have his portion in the lake That burns with brimstone and with fire.  6 Then let me always watch my lips, Lest I be struck to death and hell, Since God a book of reckoning keeps For every lye that children tell.   Song 16. _Against Quarrelling and Fighting_.  1 Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God has made them so; Let bears and lyons growl and fight, For `tis their nature too.  2 But, children, you should never let Such angry passions rise; Your little hands were never made To tear each other's eyes.  3 Let love thro' all your actions run, And all your words be mild; Live like the blessed Virgin's Son, That sweet and lovely child.  4 His soul was gentle as a lamb; And as his stature grew, He grew in favour both with man And God his Father too.  5 Now, Lord of all, he reigns above, And from his heavenly throne, He sees what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own.   Song 17. _Love between Brothers and Sisters_.  1 What ever brawls are in the street There should be peace at home; Where sisters dwell and brothers meet Quarrels shou'd never come.  2 Birds in their little nests agree; And `tis a shameful sight, When children of one family Fall out, and chide, and fight.  3 Hard names at first, and threatening words, That are but noisy breath, May grow to clubs and naked swords, To murder and to death.  4 The devil tempts one mother's son To rage against another: So wicked Cain was hurried on, Till he had kill'd his brother.  5 The wise will make their anger cool At least before `tis night; But in the bosom of a fool It burns till morning light.  5 Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage; Our little brawls remove; That as we grow to riper age, Our hearts may all be love.   Song 18. _Against Scoffing and calling Names_.  1 Our tongues were made to bless the Lord, And not speak ill of men: When others give a railing word, We must not rail again.  2 Cross words and angry names require To be chastiz'd at school; And he's in danger of hell-fire, That calls his brother, fool.  3 But lips that dare be so prophane To mock and jeer and scoff At holy things, or holy men, The Lord shall cut them off.  4 When children, in their wanton play Served old Elisha so, And bade the prophet go his way, \"Go up, thou bald head, go.\"  5 God quickly stopt their wicked breath, And sent two raging bears, That tore them limb from limb to death, With blood and groans and tears.  6 Great God, how terrible art thou To sinners ne'er so young! Grant me thy grace and teach me how To tame and rule my tongue.   Song 19. _Against Swearing and Cursing, and taking God's Name in vain_.  1 Angels that high in glory dwell Adore thy Name, Almighty God! And devils tremble down in hell Beneath the terrors of thy rod.  2 And yet how wicked children dare Abuse thy dreadful glorious Name! And when they're angry, how they swear, And curse their fellows, and blaspheme!  3 How will they stand before thy face, Who treated thee with such disdain, While thou shalt doom them to the place Of everlasting fire and pain?  4 Then never shall one cooling drop To quench their burning tongues be giv'n. But I will praise thee here, and hope Thus to employ my tongue in heav'n.  5 My heart shall be in pain to hear Wretches affront the Lord above; 'Tis that great God whose power I fear, That heavenly Father whom I love.  6 If my companions grow profane, I'll leave their friendship when I hear Young sinners take thy name in vain, And learn to curse, and learn to swear.   Song 20. _Against Idleness and Mischief_.  1 How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour, And gather honey all the day From every opening flower!  2 How skilfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax! And labours hard to store it well With the sweet food she makes.  3 In works of labour or of skill I would be busy too: For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do.  4 In books, or work, or healthful play Let my first years be past, That I may give for every day Some good account at last.   Song 21. _Against evil Company_.  1 Why should I join with those in play In whom I've no delight; Who curse and swear, but never play; Who call ill names, and fight?  2 I hate to hear a wanton song: Their words offend my ears: I should not dare defile my tongue With language such as theirs.  3 Away from fools I'll turn my eyes, Nor with the scoffers go: I would be walking with the wise, That wiser I may grow.  4 From one rude boy, that's used to mock, They learn the wicked jest: One sickly sheep infects the flock, And poisons all the rest.  5 My God, I hate to walk or dwell With sinful children here: Then let me not be sent to hell, Where none but sinners are.   Song 22. _Against Pride in Clothes_.  1 Why should our garments, made to hide Our parents' shame, provoke our pride? The art of dress did ne'er begin Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.  2 When first she put the covering on, Her robe of innocence was gone; And yet her children vainly boast In the sad marks of glory lost.  3 How proud we are! how fond to shew Our clothes, and call them rich and new, When the poor sheep and silkworms wore That very clothing long before!  4 The tulip and the butterfly Appear in gayer coats than I: Let me be dress'd fine as I will, Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.  5 Then will I set my heart to find Inward adornings of the mind: Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace, These are the robes of richest dress.  6 No more shall worms with me compare, This is the raiment angels wear: The Son of God, when here below, Put on this blest apparel too.  6 It never fades, it ne'er grows old, Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould: It takes no spot, but still refines; The more `tis worn, the more it shines.  7 In this on earth would I appear, Then go to heaven, and wear it there: God will approve it in his sight; 'Tis his own work, and his delight.   Song 23. _Obedience to Parents_.  1 Let children that would fear the Lord Hear what their teachers say; With reverence meet their parents' word, And with delight obey.  2 Have you not heard what dreadful plagues Are threaten'd by the Lord, To him that breaks his father's law, Or mocks his mother's word?  3 What heavy guilt upon him lies! How cursed is his name! The ravens shall pick out his eyes, And eagles eat the same.  4 But those who worship God, and give Their parents honour due, Here on this earth they long shall live, And live hereafter, too.   Song 24. _The Child's Complaint_.  1 Why should I love my sports so well, So constant at my play, And lose the thoughts of heaven and hell, And then forget to pray?  2 What do I read my Bible for, But, Lord, to learn thy will? And shall I daily know thee more, And less obey thee still?  3 How senseless is my heart, and wild! How vain are all my thoughts! Pity the weakness of a child, And pardon all my faults.  4 Make me thy heavenly voice to hear, And let me love to pray; Since God will lend a gracious ear To what a child can say.   Song 25. _A Morning Song_.  1 My God, who makes the sun to know His proper hour to rise; And, to give light to all below, Doth send him round the skies:  2 When from the chambers of the east His morning race begins, He never tires, nor stops to rest, But round the world he shines.  3 So, like the sun, would I fulfil The business of the day; Begin my work betimes, and still March on my heavenly way.  4 Give me, O Lord, thy early grace, Nor let my soul complain That the young morning of my day Has all been spent in vain!   Song 26. _An Evening Song_.  1 And now another day is gone, I'll sing my Maker's praise! My comforts every hour make known His providence and grace.  2 But how my childhood runs to waste My sins how great their sum! Lord, give me pardon for the past, And strength for days to come.  3 I lay my body down to sleep, Let angels guard my head; And, through the hours of darkness, keep Their watch around my head.  4 With cheerful heart I close mine eyes, Since thou wilt not remove; And in the morning let me rise Rejoicing in thy love.   Song 27. _For the Lord's Day Morning_.  1 This is the day when Christ arose So early from the dead: Why should I my eyelids close, And waste my hours in bed?  2 This is the day when Jesus broke The powers of death and hell; And shall I still wear Satan's yoke, And love my sins so well?  3 To-day, with pleasure, Christians meet, To pray, and hear thy Word; And I would go with cheerful feet To learn thy will, O Lord!  4 I'll leave my sport, to read and pray, And so prepare for heaven: O may I love this blessed day The best of all the seven!   Song 28. _For Lord's Day Evening_.  1 Lord, how delightful `tis to see A whole assembly worship thee! At once they sing, at once they pray; They hear of heaven, and learn the way.  2 I have been there, and still would go 'Tis like a little heaven below! Not all my pleasure and my play Should tempt me to forget this day.  3 O write upon my memory,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13439"],["title","Divine Songs (#3)"],["body","d, The text and doctrines of thy Word, That I may break thy laws no more, But love thee better than before!  4 With thoughts of Christ and things divine Fill up this foolish heart of mine: That, hoping pardon through his blood, I may lie down, and wake with God.   The TEN COMMANDMENTS out of the Old Testament put into short Rhime for Children.  Exod. 20.  1. Thou shalt have no more Gods but me. 2. Before no idol bow thy knee. 3. Take not the Name of God in vain: 4. Nor dare the Sabbath Day profane. 5. Give both thy parents honour due. 6. Take heed that thou no murder do. 7. Abstain from words and deeds unclean: 8. Nor steal, though thou art poor and mean. 9. Nor make a wilful lie, nor love it. 10. What is thy neighbour's, dare not covet.   The Sum of the Commandments out of the New Testament.  Matt. 22. 37.  With all thy Soul love God above; And as thyself thy Neighbour love.   Our Saviour's Golden Rule.  Matt. 7. 12.  Be you to others Kind and True, As you'd have others be to you. And neither do nor say to Men Whate'er you would not take again.   Duty to God and our neighbour.  Love God with all your Soul and Strength. With all your Heart and Mind; And love your Neighbour as your self: Be faithful, just, and kind.  Deal with another as you'd have Another deal with you. What you're unwilling to receive, Be sure you never do.   Out of my Book of _Hymns_, I have here added, the _Hosanna_ and _Glory to the Father_, &c. to be sung at the end of any of these Songs, according to the Direction of Parents or Governors.   The _Hosanna_; or Salvation ascribed to Christ.  Long Metre.  1 _Hosanna_ to king _David's_ Son, Who reigns on a superior Throne; We bless the Prince of Heav'nly Birth, Who brings Salvation down to Earth.  2 Let every nation, every age, In this delightful work engage; Old Men and Babes in _Sion_ sing The growing glories of her King!   Common Metre.  1 _Hosanna_ to the Prince of Grace; _Sion_ behold thy King; Proclaim the Son of _David's_ Race, And teach the Babes to sing.  2 _Hosanna_ to th' Eternal Word, Who from the Father came; Ascribe Salvation to the Lord, With Blessings on his Name!   Short Metre.  1 _Hosanna_ to the Son Of _David_ and of God, Who brought the News of Pardon down, And bought it with his Blood.  2 To Christ, th' anointed King, Be endless blessings giv'n, Let the whole Earth his Glory sing Who made our Peace with Heav'n.   Glory to the Father and the Son, &c.  Long Metre.  To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, Three in One, Be Honour, Praise, and Glory giv'n, By all on Earth, and all in Heav'n.   Common Metre.  Now let the Father and the Son, And Spirit be ador'd, Where there are works to make him known, Or saints to love the Lord.   Short Metre.  Give to the Father Praise, Give Glory to the Son, And to the Spirit of his Grace Be equal Honour done.     A Slight SPECIMEN of MORAL SONGS,  _Such as I wish some happy and condescending Genius would undertake for the use of Children, and perform much better_.  The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the _Proverbs of Solomon_, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other divine songs). Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with cheerfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit together.  This would be one effectual way to deliver them from the temptation of loving and learning those idle, wanton or profane songs, which give so early an ill taint to the fancy and memory, and become the seeds of future vices.   _The Sluggard_.  1 'Tis the voice of the Sluggard. I heard him complain \"You have waked me too soon! I must slumber again!\" As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed, Turns his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.  2 \"A little more sleep, and a little more slumber;\" Thus he wastes half his days, and his hours without number: And when he gets up, he sits folding his hands Or walks about sauntering, or trifling he stands.  3 I past by his garden, and saw the wild bryar The thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher: The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags; And his money still wasts, still he starves, or he begs.  4 I made him a visit, still hoping to find He had took better care for improving his mind: He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking, But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.  5 Said I then to my heart, \"Here's a lesson for me,\" That man's but a picture of what I might be: But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding: Who taught me betimes to love working and reading!   _Innocent Play_.  1 Abroad in the meadows to see the young lambs, Run sporting about by the side of their dams With fleeces so clean, and so white; Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage, When they play all in love without anger or rage, How much may we learn from the sight!  2 If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud: Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood; So foul, or so fierce are their natures. But Thomas and William, and such pretty names, Should be cleanly and harmless as doves, or as lambs, Those lovely sweet innocent creatures.  3 Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say, Should injure another in jesting or play; For he's still in earnest that's hurt. How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire! There's none but a mad-man will fling about fire, And tell you, \"`Tis all but in sport.\"   The End.   The TABLE.   1.

The End of the Table.    ADDENDUM to the Moral Songs.   Transcriber's Note.  In the 1715 edition, for the reasons explained by Watts in his Preface, there are only two moral songs, namely \"The Sluggard\" and \"Innocent Play.\" Those added later are included in this Addendum. The texts are from an 1866 printing in New York, posted into the public domain by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) at  http://www.ccel.org/ccel/watts/divsongs.html    Song 3. The Rose. 12,8,12,8  How fair is the Rose! what a beautiful flower! The glory of April and May: But the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour, And they wither and die in a day.  Yet the Rose has one powerful virtue to boast, Above all the flowers of the field! When its leaves are all dead and fine colours are lost, Still how sweet a perfume it will yield!  So frail is the youth and the beauty of man, Though they bloom and look gay like the Rose; But all our fond care to preserve them is vain, Time kills them as fast as he goes.  Then I'll not be proud of my youth and my beauty, Since both of them wither and fade; But gain a good name by well doing my duty: This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.   Song 4. The thief 8,7,8,7  Why should I deprive my neighbour Of his goods against his will? Hands were made for honest labour, Not to plunder, or to steal.  'Tis a foolish self-deceiving By such tricks to hope for gain:  All that's ever got by thieving Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.  Have not Eve and Adam taught us Their sad profit to compute, To what dismal state they brought us When they stole forbidden fruit?  Oft we see a young beginner Practice little pilfering ways, Till grown up a harden'd sinner, Then the gallows ends his days.  Theft will not be always hidden, Though we fancy none can spy: When we take a thing forbidden, God beholds it with his eye.  Guard my heart, O God of heaven, Lest I covet what's not mine; Lest I steal what is not given, Guard my heart and hands from sin.   Song 5. The ant, or emmet. 11,11,8,11,11,8  These Emmets, how little they are in our eyes! We tread them to dust, and a troop of them dies, Without our regard or concern: Yet, as wise as we are, if we went to their school, There's many a sluggard and many a fool Some lessons of wisdom might learn.  They wear not their time out in sleeping or play, But gather up corn in a sunshiny day, And for winter they lay up their stores: They manage their work in such regular forms, One would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms, And so brought their food withindoors.  But I have less sense than a poor creeping Ant, If I take not due care for the things I shall want, Nor provide against dangers in time; When death or old age shall once stare in my face, What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days, If I trifle away all their prime!  Now, now, while my strength and my youth are in bloom, Let me think what shall serve me when sickness shall come, And pray that my sins be forgiven. Let me read in good books, and"]]]
