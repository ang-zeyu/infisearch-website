I got an idea, from what Frank said once, that he was in charge of you--well, not exactly that, but he looked after you.\"  This was a wicked falsehood, as Frank had never intimated any such thing. In fact, he had generally kept quite aloof from James.  Mark, however, fell into the trail, and never thought of doubting what his companion said.  \"If Frank said that, I've a great mind to whip him,\" said Mark, angrily.  \"Oh, I wouldn't notice him, if I were you!\" said James. \"For my part, I didn't believe what he said. I felt sure that a fine, spirited boy like you wouldn't submit to his dictation.\"  \"I should say not--the impudent follow!\"  \"When he spoke to you just now,\" continued James, \"one would really have thought he was your uncle, or guardian, and that you were a little boy.\"  \"I'll show him what I think of him and his advice. I hadn't thought of going to the saloon to-morrow, but now I will.\"  \"Bravo! I like your spirit!\" said James, admiringly. \"It is just the way to treat him. Shall I come round with you about the same hour as to-day?\"  \"Yes, I wish you would.\"  When the two boys parted company, James Carson smiled to himself.  \"What a fool Mark is!\" he thought. \"He thinks he is his own master, but I am going to twist him round my little finger. He's a sweet youth, but he's got money, and I mean to have some of it. Why, he tells me his father allows him eight dollars a week for spending money. If I manage well, I can get more than half away from his in bets.\"  The next day James called for Mark, as agreed upon, and again the two boys went to the billiard saloon. The performance of the day before was repeated.  James Carson, while flattering Mark's poor play, managed to beat in every game but one on which money was staked, and came out the richer by a dollar and a half.  \"I am very unlucky,\" grumbled Mark, in a tone of dissatisfaction.  \"So you were, Mark,\" admitted his sympathizing friend. \"You made some capital shots, though, and if I hadn't been so lucky, you would have come out the victor in every game.\"  \"But I didn't.\"  \"No, you didn't; but you can't have such beastly luck all the time.\"  \"I guess I'd better give up billiards. In two days I have spent five dollars. It doesn't pay.\"  \"No doubt Frank will be gratified when he hears that you have given up playing. He will think it is because you are afraid of him.\"  James had touched the right chord, and poor Mark was once more in his toils.  \"It's lucky for me that Frank spoke to him,\" thought James. \"It makes it much easier for me to manage him.\"  One thing, however, James had not taken into account. There were others besides Frank who were liable to interfere with his management, and who had the authority to make their interference effectual.  On the day succeeding, as James and Mark were in the campus, Herbert Grant approached them.  Now Herbert was the janitor of the academy. He also was employed by the principal to summon students who had incurred censure to his study, where they received a suitable reprimand.  It was not a pleasant duty, but some one must do it, and Herbert always discharged it in a gentlemanly manner, which could not, or ought not, to offend the schoolfellows who were unlucky enough to receive a summons.  \"Boys,\" said he, \"I am sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant news, but Dr. Brush would like to see you in his study.\"  \"Both of us?\" asked James.  \"Yes.\"  \"Are there any others summoned?\"  \"No.\"  Mark and his companion looked at each other with perturbed glances. No one cared to visit the principal on such an errand. Corporal punishment was never resorted to in the Bridgeville Academy, but the doctor's dignified rebuke was dreaded more than blows would have been from some men.  \"What do you think it is, James?\" asked Mark, uneasily.  \"I think it's the saloon,\" answered James, in a low voice.  \"But how could he have found it out? No one saw us go in or come out.\"  The billiard saloon was at some distance from the academy building, and for that reason the two boys had felt more secure in visiting it.  \"I'll tell you how it came out,\" said James, suddenly.  \"How?\" asked Mark.  \"You remember Frank saw us coming out day before yesterday.\"  \"He said he wouldn't tell.\"  It was not very difficult for Mark to believe anything against Frank, and he instantly adopted his companion's idea.  \"The mean sneak!\" he said. \"I'll come up with him! I'll tell my father not to give him any money for the next month. I'll---I'll get him to apprentice Frank to a shoemaker! Perhaps then he won't put on so many airs.\"  \"Good for you! I admire your pluck!\" said James, slapping Mark on the back. \"You are true grit, you are! Just teach the fellow a lesson.\"  \"See if I don't!\"  Mark nodded his head resolutely, and went into the presence of Dr. Brush, thirsting for vengeance against his stepbrother, who, he felt persuaded, had informed against him.  If Frank had known his suspicions he would have been very much surprised. As it happened, however, he did not even know that his stepbrother had been summoned to the doctor's study. Had he met Herbert, the later would have told him; but after receiving his list, it so chanced that he and his friend did not meet.  The fact was that a young man employed as tutor in mathematics in the academy, while taking an afternoon walk, had seen Mark and James Carson leaving the liquor saloon, and, as in duty bound, had reported the same to the principal.  Mr. Triangle, however, had not been observed by either of the two boys, and therefore they were led off on a false scent.  \"What do you think the old man will say?\" asked Mark, uneasily, as they ascended the stairs to the principal's study.  \"He'll give us a raking down, I suppose,\" said James. \"He will come down heavy on us.\"  \"I wish I were out of it.\"  \"Oh, it's not worth minding! We haven't committed murder, have we? What's the harm in a game of billiards?\"  \"Not much, perhaps; but the drinking and betting are certainly objectionable.\"  The boys knocked at the door, and the full, deep voice of Dr. Brush was heard to say: \"Come in!\"     CHAPTER XII  SUSPENDED   Dr. Brush was seated at a table covered with papers, in a large armchair. He was an elderly man of dignified presence, not a petty tyrant such as is sometimes found in a similar position, but a man who commanded respect, without an effort.  Mark Manning and James Carson entered his presence a little nervously.  \"Young gentlemen,\" said the doctor, gravely, \"I am informed that you have violated one of the rules of the academy by frequenting a billiard saloon where liquor is sold.\"  \"Who told you, sir?\" asked Mark.  \"That is not to the purpose,\" said the principal, gravely.  \"But I should like to know who informed on me,\" persisted Mark.  \"Whoever did so acted as your true friend, Manning; but there is no occasion for you to know who it was. Is it true?\"  Mark would have been glad to deny the charge, and would not have felt any scruples about doing so, if it would have done any good. But it was clear, even to him, that he would not be believed, and that denial would only make his position worse. So he made a virtue of necessity, and answered:  \"I have been in once or twice, sir.\"  \"Exactly how many times have you been to the saloon?\"  \"Three times.\"  \"What did you do there?'  \"We played billiards.\"  \"Did you order anything at the bar?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Mark, reluctantly.  \"Carson, you accompanied Manning, did you not?\" said Dr. Brush, turning to Mark's companion.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And I suppose you also played billiards and drank?\"  \"Well, yes, sir, I believe I did.\"  \"You were aware, were you not, that it was against the regulations of the school?\"  \"I suppose it must have slipped my mind,\" answered James, trying to look as innocent as possible.  Dr. Brush frowned, for he saw clearly that this was but a subterfuge.  \"If this were true,\" he continued, \"it would be no excuse. As students, it is your duty to make yourselves acquainted with the rules that govern the institution. In point of fact, I cannot believe that either of you is ignorant of the rule forbidding students to frequent places where liquor is sold. It is hardly necessary for me to defend the propriety of this rule. Intemperance is a fruitful source of vice and crime, and I cannot allow the youth under by charge to form habits of indulgence which may blast all their prospects, and lead to the most ruinous consequences.\"  \"We didn't drink much,\" said Mark.  \"I shall not inquire how much you drank. In drinking a single glass, you violated the rule of the school, and I cannot pass over it.\"  \"What is he going to do with us, I wonder?\" thought Mark.  He was not required to wonder long.  \"As this is your first offense, so far as I know,\" proceeded the principal, \"I will not be severe. You are both suspended from the institution for the remainder of the term, and are required to leave Bridgeville by the early train to-morrow morning for your respective homes. I shall write to your parents, explaining the cause of your suspension.\"  But a week remained of the term, and the punishment was mild, but both boys were mortified and left the study crestfallen.  Mark was the first to recover his spirits.  \"It is not so bad, James,\" he said. \"To-morrow will be Saturday, and I should go home, anyway. I don't mind staying at home next week.\"  \"What will your father say?\"  \"Oh, I'll make it all right with him! I don't mind much what he says. I guess he got into scrapes himself when he was a boy.\"  \"My father isn't so easily managed. Just as likely as not, he'll cut off my allowance for a month; and that'll be no joke!\"  \"My father won't do that,\" said Mark. \"If he did, I would raise a fuss.\"  \"Would that do any good?\"  \"I'll bet it would!\"  Frank, who was quite ignorant of Mark's trouble, was surprised when the latter approached him a little later with a frown and said, harshly:  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13803"],["title","Making His Way; Or, Frank Courtney's Struggle Upward (#8)"],["body","won't make anything by what you have done, Frank Courtney!\"  \"Will you be kind enough to tell me what I have done?\" asked Frank, calmly.  \"You've been to Dr. Brush and told him about our playing billiards.\"  \"You are entirely mistaken, Mark. I did not suppose he knew.\"  \"It must have been you. He told us some one had informed him, and you were the only one who knew. It's a mean trick, isn't it, Carson?\"  \"Awfully mean!\"  \"I have already told you that the information did not come from me. It may be the best thing for you that it has been found out, for it was doing you no good to frequent such places.\"  \"I don't want to hear any of your preaching, Frank Courtney. I guess I can manage my own affairs without any advice from you.\"  \"I don't care to intrude any advice,\" said Frank. \"I have not much reason to feel interested in you.\"  \"You'd better look out how you treat me, though,\" said Mark, insolently. \"I know very well you dislike me, but it won't be safe for you to show it while you are a dependent on my father.\"  \"I don't propose to be a dependent on him long,\" said Frank, quietly. \"The truth of it is, you and your father are dependent upon property which of right belongs to me. The time may come when I shall be able to show this.\"  \"What does he mean?\" thought Mark, uneasily. \"Will he contest the will?\"  It was perhaps an evidence of Mark's shrewdness that he had some doubts about the validity of the will under which his father inherited.     CHAPTER XIII  MR. MANNING'S NEW PLAN   Mark so represented his school difficulty to his father that he incurred but slight censure.  Indeed, Mr. Manning was so absorbed in plans for getting the greatest enjoyment out of the estate of which he had obtained possession by doubtful means that he didn't care to be disturbed about such a trifle as his son's suspension.  He felt more disposed to blame Frank, whom Mark charged with betraying him.  \"What does Frank say about it?\" asked Mr. Manning.  \"Of course he denies it,\" said Mark, \"but it can't be any one else.\"  \"He is acting very unwisely,\" said Mr. Manning, compressing his thin lips.  \"So I told him, but he said he didn't mean to be a dependent on you long.\"  \"How is he going to avoid it?'  \"I don't know.\"  \"I have had some intimation from Col. Vincent, who appears to be in his confidence. He wants to leave us.\"  \"To go away?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"But you won't let him?\"  \"I have been thinking about that, Mark, and I may give my permission. The fact is, he stands in the way of some plans I have formed. I am thinking of traveling.\"  \"Not without me?\" said Mark, hastily.  \"No; you shall go with me, but I don't care to take Frank.\"  \"You might leave him at school.\"  \"I might, but how do I know that he might not hatch some mischief while we are gone?\"  \"He might make some fuss about the property,\" suggested Mark.  \"Has he hinted anything of that kind to you?\" asked his father, quickly.  \"Yes. Only yesterday he said that the property belonged by right to him.\"  Mr. Manning looked thoughtful, and watched Mark narrowly to see if from his manner he could divine the boy's intentions.  Later that same evening, Mark having retired early in consequence of a headache, Frank found himself alone with his stepfather, and took advantage of the opportunity to speak of the plan he had formed.  \"Mr. Manning,\" he said, \"if you are at leisure, I should like to speak with you a few minutes.\"  \"Proceed,\" said his stepfather, waving his hand.  \"But a week remains of the school term. Did you propose that I should return there at the end of the vacation?\"  \"Humph! I had not thought much on the subject.\"  \"It has all along been intended that I should go to college when prepared, but I don't think I care much about it.\"  \"In that case,\" said his stepfather, with alacrity, \"you would only be throwing away time and money by going.\"  He was quite ready to agree to Frank's surrender of the college plan for two reasons.  A college course would be expensive. Again, should he turn his attention to the law, he might hereafter give him trouble about the estate.  \"I don't think I should throw away my time, for, if I went to college, I should go there to work faithfully; but I have a fancy for a more stirring life.\"  \"It might be a good plan for you to learn a trade,\" said Mr. Manning, reflectively.  \"Learn a trade!\" exclaimed Frank, in surprise.  \"Yes; it would always enable you to earn a living.\"  \"Do you intend Mark to learn a trade?\" asked Frank, quickly.  \"No; his case is very different from yours.\"  \"Why it is different?\"  \"It is not necessary for me to explain,\" answered his stepfather, stiffly.  \"If there were any need of it, Mr. Manning, I would not object to learn a trade,\" said Frank. \"I have no false pride on the subject. But my tastes are more for mercantile business.\"  \"I may be able to find you a place somewhere. I have a friend in the dry-goods business, who would receive you at my recommendation.\"  \"Thank you!\" said Frank, hastily. \"But if you will allow me, I would prefer to look around for myself.\"  \"What is it you want, then?\"  \"Your permission to go out into the world, and try to make a living.\"  \"And if you don't,\" said Mr. Manning, \"I suppose you expect me to defray your expenses?\"  \"If I did have such an expectation, I think I should be justified, in view of the large property which my mother left,\" said Frank, pointedly.  \"She left it to me,\" said his stepfather.  \"So it appears, at any rate. But I shall not call upon you to pay my board. Give me your permission to go where I please, with a small sum of money to start me, and I shall be satisfied.\"  \"And what will the world say? That I, your stepfather, to whom you have a right to look for maintenance, had driven you out to earn your living! It would be unjust, of course, but the world is ever unjust.\"  And Mr. Manning assumed a look of wronged innocence, which would have imposed on anyone who knew him but slightly.  \"I shall defend you from any such charge,\" said Frank. \"I shall say that you were only yielding to my request.\"  \"I will think of it, my dear boy,\" said Mr. Manning, graciously. \"I already feel inclined to grant it, because it is your request. I shall be sorry to be separated from you; but I am willing to sacrifice my own feelings, if it will give you pleasure.\"  This did not impose upon Frank, who had a correct idea of the degree of fondness which Mr. Manning had for his society, but he was too well satisfied with the prospect of obtaining the permission he desired to imply any doubts.  \"Again,\" continued his stepfather, \"whatever you may say to the contrary, I know that the world will censure me; but I shall have the approval of my own conscience, and with that I can defy the world.\"  Mr. Manning certainly did look like a righteous man when he said this, and he beamed upon his stepson with a glance that was actually affectionate.  \"Go back to school,\" ho said, \"and when you return I shall be able to give you a definite answer.\"  Indeed, nothing could have suited Mr. Manning's plans better. He would get rid of the care and nearly the whole expense of his obnoxious stepson, while with his son Mark he would be spending the revenues of the estate which belonged to Frank.  During the coming week he arranged his plans for a prolonged absence from the Cedars. He wrote to New York to engage passage on a steamer bound for Liverpool, and quietly waited for the end of Frank's school term to release him from a care which had grown burdensome.  Frank returned to the Bridgeville Academy without Mark. As may be supported, however, he did not feel the loss of his society.  He at once communicated to his chosen friend, Herbert Grant, his probable departure from school.  \"I am sorry to hear it, Frank,\" said Herbert, soberly. \"Do you think you are acting wisely?\"  \"I am not acting as I would have done had my mother lived,\" answered Frank; \"but you must remember that my position in life has very much changed. I am a poor boy.\"  \"Hardly that, when there is so much property in the family.\"  \"I know Mr. Manning too well to believe that I shall derive much benefit from it. No, Herbert, I have my own living to make, and I want to make it in my own way.\"  \"It is a sad change for you, Frank.\"  \"No, I can't say that. I don't know how it is, Herbert, but I am rather glad to have all this thrown upon me. I enjoy feeling that I have got to work.\"  \"I have a chance of enjoying the same feelings,\" said Herbert, with a smile.  \"I wish we could start together, Herbert. Couldn't you go with me?\"  Herbert shook his head.  \"Father has a plan for me,\" he said. \"I am to learn his trade, and shall commence next week. I don't particularly like it, but it is well to have a trade to fall back upon.\"  \"Mr. Manning wanted me to learn a trade.\"  \"There is no occasion for your doing so.\"  \"I don't know about that. If I had a particular fancy for any, I wouldn't mind choosing it, but I am better suited for something else.\"  \"What is your plan? What will you do first?\"  \"My father has a cousin in the city of Newark, New Jersey, only a few miles from New York. Four years ago, he and his family made us a visit, and he was urgent then that we should return the visit. I will, first of all, go to him, and ask his advice. He is a business man, and he may be able to put me in the way of obtaining a position.\"  \"I think you will succeed, Frank, but it will be harder than you think for. You don't know what poverty is yet. I have never known anything else.\"  \"If I do succeed, Herbert, I may be able to find something for you.\"  \"I wish you might,\" Herbert replied; but he was not as sanguine as Frank.  He understood, better than his friend, that for a boy to set out alone into the great world to earn a living is a serious undertaking.     CHAPTER XIV  GOOD-BYE   Frank had fixed upon the Tuesday morning succeeding the close of the academic term for his departure from home. Monday was devoted to a few necessary preparations and a few"]]]
