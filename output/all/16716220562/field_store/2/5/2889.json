Of Addison he wrote with appreciation, but briefly: \"This is that excellent friend to whom Mr. Steele owes so much, and who refuses to have his pen set before those pieces which the greatest pens in England would be proud to own. Indeed, they could hardly add to this gentleman's reputation, whose works in Latin and English poetry long since convinced the world that he was the greatest master in Europe of those two languages.\" Of Steele, Gay wrote at greater length: \"To give you my own thoughts of this gentleman's writings, I shall, in the first place, observe that there is a noble difference between him and all the rest of our polite and gallant authors. The latter have endeavoured to please the age by falling in with them, and encourage them in their fashionable views and false notion of things. It would have been a jest, some time since, for a man to have asserted that anything witty could be said in praise of a married state, or that devotion and virtue were any way necessary to the character of a fine gentleman. Bickerstaff ventured to tell the town that they were a parcel of fops, fools and coquettes; but in such a manner as even pleased them, and made them more than half-inclined to believe that he spoke truth. Instead of complying with the false sentiments and vicious tastes of the age--either in morality, criticism, or good breeding--he has boldly assured them that they were altogether in the wrong; and commanded them, with an authority which perfectly well became him, to surrender themselves to his arguments for virtue and good sense. It is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the town; how many thousand follies they have either quite banished, or given a very great check to! how much countenance they have added to virtue and religion! how many people they have rendered happy, by showing them it was their own fault if they were not so! and, lastly, how entirely they have convinced our young fops and young fellows of the value and advantages of learning! He has indeed rescued it out of the hands of pedants and fools, and discovered the true method of making it amicable and lovely to all mankind. In the dress he gives it, it is a welcome guest at tea-tables and assemblies, and is relished and caressed by the merchants on the 'Change. Accordingly there is not a lady at Court, nor a banker in Lombard Street who is not verily persuaded that Captain Steele is the greatest scholar and best casuist of any man in England. Lastly, his writings have set all our wits and men of letters on a new way of thinking, of which they had little or no notion before: and, although we cannot say that any of them have come up to the beauties of the original, I think we may venture to affirm, that every one of them writes and thinks much more justly than they did some time since.\"  Gay's agreeable personality secured him many friends. Not later than the spring of 1711 he made the acquaintance of Henry Cromwell, whom he later described as \"the honest hatless Cromwell with red breeches,\" by whom he was introduced to Pope, who was at this time a member of Addison's circle, and generally recognised as a rising man of letters. Pope evidently liked Gay, who was his senior by nearly three years, but was as a child in worldly wisdom. On July 15th, 1711, Pope wrote to Cromwell, \"Pray give my service to all my friends, and to Mr. Gay in particular\";[10] and again, nine days later, addressing the same correspondent, he said: \"My humble services, too, to Mr. Gay, of whose paper ['The Present State of Wit'] I have made mention to [Erasmus] Lewis.\"[11] Gay, ever anxious to please those whom he liked and, perhaps, especially those who might be of use to him, when writing the verses, \"On a Miscellany of Poems to Bernard Lintott\" (which appeared in that publisher's _Miscellany_ issued in May, 1712), eagerly took advantage to ingratiate himself with a number of people, in so far as he could do this by means of compliments. Gay tells the publisher that if he will only choose his authors from \"the successful bards\" praised by the author, then \"praise with profit shall reward thy pains\"; and--    So long shall live thy praise in books of fame,   And Tonson yield to Lintott's lofty name;  but, since an author should not praise one publisher at the expense of another, he has already had a kindly word for that more celebrated publisher, Jacob Tonson--\"Jacob's mighty name.\" It may be mentioned in passing that Gay's \"Poems on Several Occasions\" bear the joint imprint of Lintott and Tonson. Gay waxed eloquent in these verses, when writing of the other contributors to the _Miscellany_, and bestowed praise upon his brother-poets in no measured quantity:--      Where Buckingham will condescend to give   That honour'd piece to distant times must live;   When noble Sheffield strikes the trembling strings,   The little loves rejoice and clap their wings.   Anacreon lives, they cry, th' harmonious swain }   Retunes the lyre, and tries his wonted strain, }   'Tis he,--our lost Anacreon lives again.       }   But when th' illustrious poet soars above   The sportive revels of the god of love,   Like Maro's muse he takes a loftier flight,   And towers beyond the wond'ring Cupid's sight.      If thou wouldst have thy volume stand the test,   And of all others be reputed best,   Let Congreve teach the list'ning groves to mourn,   As when he wept o'er fair Pastora's urn.[12]      Let Prior's muse with soft'ning accents move,   Soft as the strain of constant Emma's love:   Or let his fancy choose some jovial theme.   As when he told Hans Carvel's jealous dream;   Prior th' admiring reader entertains,   With Chaucer's humour, and with Spenser's strains.[13]    Waller in Granville lives; when Mira sings   With Waller's hands he strikes the sounding strings.   With sprightly turns his noble genius shines,   And manly sense adorns his easy lines.       On Addison's sweet lays attention waits,   And silence guards the place while he repeats;   His muse alike on ev'ry subject charms,   Whether she paints the god of love, or arms:   In him pathetic Ovid sings again,   And Homer's \"Iliad\" shines in his \"Campaign.\"   Whenever Garth shall raise his sprightly song,   Sense flows in easy numbers from his tongue;   Great Phoebus in his learned son we see,   Alike in physic, as in poetry.       When Pope's harmonious muse with pleasure roves,   Amidst the plains, the murm'ring streams and groves.   Attentive Echo, pleased to hear his songs,   Thro' the glad shade each warbling note prolongs;   His various numbers charm our ravish'd ears,       }   His steady judgment far out-shoots his years,      }   And early in the youth the god appears.            }  It was in reference to these complimentary lines (which Pope saw in manuscript) that, on December 21st, 1711, Pope wrote to Cromwell: \"I will willingly return Mr. Gay my thanks for the favour of his poem, and in particular for his kind mention of me.\"[14] That letter is interesting also as being the last exchanged between Pope and his old friend; and it is instructive, as showing how the acquaintance between the poets was already ripening, that Pope turned to Gay in his distress at the defection of his earlier friend. \"Our friend, Mr. Cromwell, too, has been silent all this year. I believe he has been displeased at some or other of my freedoms, which I very innocently take, and most with those I think my friends,\" he wrote to Gay on November 13th, 1712. \"But this I know nothing of; perhaps he may have opened to you, and if I know you right, you are of a temper to cement friendships, and not to divide them. I really very much love Mr. Cromwell, and have a true affection for yourself, which, if I had any interest in the world, or power with those who have, I should not be long without manifesting to you.\"[15]  If Pope had lost the friendship of Henry Cromwell, he was certainly anxious to strengthen the bond that was beginning to be forged between himself and Gay, to whom he wrote again: \"I desire you will not, either out of modesty, or a vicious distrust of another's value for you--those two eternal foes to merit--imagine that your letters and conversation are not always welcome to me. There is no man more entirely fond of good-nature or ingenuity than myself, and I have seen too much of these qualities in Mr. Gay to be anything less than his most affectionate friend and real servant.\"[16] That the intimacy between the poets waxed apace is evident, for when Pope wrote \"A Farewell to London in the year 1715,\" the concluding stanza was:--    Adieu to all but Gay alone.      Whose soul, sincere and free.   Loves all mankind, but flatters none.      And so may starve with me.

There has been preserved a letter written by Aaron Hill to Richard Savage, June 23rd, 1766, which contains"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13790"],["title","Life And Letters Of John Gay (1685-1732), Author of \"The Beggar's Opera\" (#4)"],["body","concerning the life of the poet during the next two years. \"I would willingly satisfy the curiosity of your friend, in relation to Mr. Gay, if it were not easy to get much further information than I am able to give, from Mr. Budgell or Mr. Pope; to the first of whom, the beginning of his life was best known, and to the last, its afternoon and evening,\" Hill wrote. \"As to your question, whether Mr. Gay was ever a domestic of the Duchess of Monmouth, I can answer it in the affirmative; he was her secretary about the year 1713, and continued so, till he went over to Hanover, in the beginning of the following year, with Lord Clarendon, who was sent thither by Queen Anne. At his return, upon the death of that Queen, all his hopes became withered, but Mr. Pope (who you know, is an excellent planter) revived and invigorated his bays, and indeed, very generously supported him, in some more _solid_ improvements; for remember a letter, wherein he invited him, with a very impoetical warmth that, so long as he himself had a shilling, Mr. Gay should be welcome to sixpence of it, nay, to eightpence, if he could but contrive to live on a groat.\"[1]  It is now happily possible to elaborate the information given in this letter. Owing to the kindly offices of one or other of his friends, Gay had secured the appointment of domestic secretary to the Duchess of Monmouth. Anne Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch in her own right, had in 1663 married the Duke of Monmouth. He was executed for high treason in 1683, and three years later his widow married Charles, third Baron Cornwallis. Though she had not long mourned her first husband, she did not forget that he was on his father's side of the blood royal, and to the end of her days she preserved a regal state, which, however, did not make her unpopular at Court. \"The Princess,\" wrote Lady Cowper, \"loved her mightily, and certainly no woman of her years ever deserved it so well. She had all the life and fire of youth, and it was marvellous to see that the many afflictions she had suffered had not touched her wit and good nature, but at upwards of three-score she had both in their full perfection.\" Upon this appointment Dr. Johnson commented: \"By quitting a shop for such service Gay might gain leisure, but he certainly advanced little on the boast of independence.\" As has been seen, however, there was an interval of several years between Gay's apprenticeship and his taking up this position as the Duchess's amanuensis--for it is doubtful if he ever attained to an office more responsible than this--he secured board and lodging, a little pocket money, and no doubt ample leisure. It was necessary for Gay to earn his livelihood, for he had spent his patrimony, and the earnings of his pen were as yet negligible. Indeed, the situation was almost ideal for an impecunious young man of letters. Anyhow, Gay was delighted, and Pope not less so. \"It has been my good fortune within this month past to hear more things that have pleased me than, I think, in all my time besides,\" Pope wrote to Gay, December 24th, 1712; \"but nothing, upon my word, has been so homefelt a satisfaction as the news you tell me of yourself; and you are not in the least mistaken when you congratulate me upon your own good success, for I have more people out of whom to be happy, than any ill-natured man can boast of.\" Pope, now well aware of Gay's natural indolence, was careful in this same letter to urge him to devote himself to literary labours in his leisure hours. \"I shall see you this winter with much greater pleasure than I could the last, and I hope as much of your time as your Duchess will allow you to spare to any friend will not be thought lost upon one who is as much so as any man,\" he added. \"I must also put you in mind, though you are now secretary to this lady, you are likewise secretary to nine other ladies, and are to write sometimes for them too. He who is forced to live wholly upon those ladies' favours is indeed in as precarious a condition as any who does what Chaucer says for subsistence; but they are very agreeable companions, like other ladies, when a man only passes a night or so with them at his leisure, and away.\"[2]  Gay, the most amiable of men, never resented advice, perhaps because he so rarely followed it. In this case, however, he was surprisingly amenable. During the short time he was in the service of the Duchess of Monmouth, he drove his quill with some assiduity, and, indeed, at this period of his life he, who was presently distinguished as the laziest of men, worked diligently.  Before joining the household of the Duchess, he had written \"Rural Sports: A Georgic,\" and this was published on January 13th, 1713, by Jacob Tonson, with an inscription to Pope:--    You, who the sweets of rural life have known,   Despise th' ungrateful hurry of the town;   In Windsor groves your easy hours employ,   And, undisturb'd, yourself and Muse enjoy.  During 1713 Gay wrote such trifles as papers on \"Reproof and Flattery,\" and \"Dress,\" which were printed in the _Guardian_ on March 24th and September 21st respectively; and some verses, \"Panthea,\" \"Araminta,\" \"A Thought on Eternity,\" and \"A Contemplation on Night,\" which appeared in Steele's \"Poetical Miscellany.\" A more ambitious work was \"The Fan,\" which had occupied him during the earlier part of the year. He was greatly interested in its composition, and corresponded with Pope while it was being written. \"I am very much recreated and refreshed with the news of the advancement of 'The Fan,' which I doubt not will delight the eye and sense of the fair, as long as that agreeable machine shall play in the hands of posterity,\" Pope wrote to him, August 23rd, 1713: \"I am glad your Fan is mounted so soon, but I would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure, and polish the sticks as much as you can. You may then cause it to be borne in the hands of both sexes, no less in Britain than it is in China, where it is ordinary for a mandarin to fan himself cool after a debate, and a statesman to hide his face with it when he tells a grave lie.\"[3] Again, on October 23rd, Pope wrote: \"I shall go into the country about a month hence, and shall then desire to take along with me your poem of 'The Fan.'\" The most ambitious as yet of Gay's writings, there are few to-day, however, who will question the judgment of Mr. Austin Dobson, \"one of his least successful efforts, and, though touched by Pope, now unreadable.\"  Gay had thus early a leaning to the theatre, where presently he was to score one of his greatest successes, and he wrote \"The Wife of Bath,\" which was produced at Drury Lane on May 12th, 1713. Steele gave it a \"puff preliminary\" in No. 50 of the _Guardian_ (May 8th).  Gay was now become known as a man of letters, and had made many friends. Johnson says: \"Gay was the general favourite of the whole association of wits; but they regarded him as a playfellow rather than as a partner, and treated him with more fondness than respect.\"[4] There is some truth in this view, but of the affection he inspired there is no doubt. To know him was to love him. Wherein exactly lay his charm it is not easy now to say; but his gentle good-nature and his utter helplessness seems to have appealed to those of sterner mould. The extracts already given from Pope's correspondence show the affection with which he was inspired for his brother of the pen. Pope took him so completely under his massive wing that he remarked later, \"they would call him one of my _éleves_.\"[5] Pope accepted the position, and introduced him to his circle. He made him known to Swift, and that great man loved him as he loved no other man; and to Parnell, Arbuthnot, Ford--the \"joyous Ford\" of \"Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece\"--and Bolingbroke, in all of whom he inspired an affection, which endured through life. Parnell and Pope wrote jointly to him, and while in 1714 Pope was still addressing him as \"Dear Mr. Gay,\" Parnell had already thrown aside all formality and greeted him as \"Dear Gay.\" His old schoolfellow, William Fortescue, cleaved to him, and they were in such constant communication that when Pope wanted to see Fortescue, it was to Gay he appealed to arrange a meeting. The terms on which Gay was with the set is shown in Pope's letter to him, written from Binfield, May 4th, 1714: \"Pray give, with the utmost fidelity and esteem, my hearty service to the Dean, Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Ford, and to Mr. Fortescue. Let them also know at Button's that I am mindful of them.\"[6] Erasmus Lewis Gay knew now, and Caryll too, and the rest of the small literary set, who, with gusto, made him welcome among them. Indeed, when the \"Memoirs of Scriblerus\" were in contemplation, and, indeed, begun in 1713, Gay, then comparatively unknown, was invited to take a hand in the composition with the greatest men of the day. \"The design of the Memoirs of Scriblerus was to have ridiculed all the false tastes in learning, under a character of a man of capacity enough, that had dipped into every art and science, but injudiciously in each,\" we have been told. \"It was begun by a club of some of the greatest wits of the age. Lord Oxford, the Bishop of Rochester, Mr. Pope, Congreve, Arbuthnot, Swift, and others. Gay often held the pen; and Addison liked it well enough, and was not disinclined to come in to it.\"[7] It does not transpire whether Gay had at this time met Swift, but that soon after they were in correspondence, appears from a letter from Pope to Swift, June 18th, 1714: \"I shall translate Homer by the by. Mr. Gay has acquainted you with what progress I have made in it. I cannot name Mr. Gay without all the acknowledgments which I shall owe you, on his account.\"[8]   [Footnote 1: Hill: _Works_ (ed. 1754), I, p. 325.]  [Footnote 2: Pope: _Works_ (ed.
