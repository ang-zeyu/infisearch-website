When we have realized the special sensitivity of the orificial regions and the peculiarly close relationships between the breasts and the sexual organs we may easily understand the considerable part which they normally play in the art of love. As one of the chief secondary sexual characters in women, and one of her chief beauties, a woman's breasts offer themselves to the lover's lips with a less intimate attraction than her mouth only because the mouth is better able to respond. On her side, such contact is often instinctively desired. Just as the sexual disturbance of pregnancy is accompanied by a sympathetic disturbance in the breasts, so the sexual excitement produced by the lover's proximity reacts on the breasts; the nipple becomes turgid and erect in sympathy with the clitoris; the woman craves to place her lover in the place of the child, and experiences a sensation in which these two supreme objects of her desire are deliciously mingled.      The powerful effect which stimulation of the nipple produces on     the sexual sphere has led to the breasts playing a prominent part     in the erotic art of those lands in which this art has been most     carefully cultivated. Thus in India, according to Vatsyayana,     many authors are of the opinion that in approaching a woman a     lover should begin by sucking the nipples of her breasts, and in     the songs of the Bayaderes of Southern India sucking the nipple     is mentioned as one of the natural preliminaries of coitus.      In some cases, and more especially in neurotic persons, the     sexual pleasure derived from manipulation of the nipple passes     normal limits and, being preferred even to coitus, becomes a     perversion. In girls' schools, it is said, especially in France,     sucking and titillation of the breasts are not uncommon; in men,     also, titillation of the nipples occasionally produces sexual     sensations (Féré, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 132).     Hildebrandt recorded the case of a young woman whose nipples had     been sucked by her lover; by constantly drawing her breasts she     became able to suck them herself and thus attained extreme sexual     pleasure. A.J. Bloch, of New Orleans, has noted the case of a     woman who complained of swelling of the breasts; the gentlest     manipulation produced an orgasm, and it was found that the     swelling had been intentionally produced for the sake of this     manipulation. Moraglia in Italy knew a very beautiful woman who     was perfectly cold in normal sexual relationships, but madly     excited when her husband pressed or sucked her breasts. Lombroso     (_Archivio di Psichiatria_, 1885, fasc. IV) has described the     somewhat similar case of a woman who had no sexual sensitivity in     the clitoris, vagina, or labia, and no pleasure in coitus except     in very strange positions, but possessed intense sexual feelings     in the right nipple as well as in the upper third of the thigh.      It is remarkable that not only is suckling apt to be accompanied     by sexual pleasure in the mother, but that, in some cases, the     infant also appears to have a somewhat similar experience. This     is, at all events, indicated in a remarkable case recorded by     Féré (_L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 257). A female     infant child of slightly neurotic heredity was weaned at the age     of 14 months, but so great was her affection for her mother's     breasts, though she had already become accustomed to other food,     that this was only accomplished with great difficulty and by     allowing her still to caress the naked breasts several times a     day. This went on for many months, when the mother, becoming     again pregnant, insisted on putting an end to it. So jealous was     the child, however, that it was necessary to conceal from her the     fact that her younger sister was suckled at her mother's breasts,     and once at the age of 3, when she saw her father aiding her     mother to undress, she became violently jealous of him. This     jealousy, as well as the passion for her mother's breasts,     persisted to the age of puberty, though she learned to conceal     it. At the age of 13, when menstruation began, she noticed in     dancing with her favorite girl friends that when her breasts came     in contact with theirs she experienced a very agreeable     sensation, with erection of the nipples; but it was not till the     age of 16 that she observed that the sexual region took part in     this excitement and became moist. From this period she had erotic     dreams about young girls. She never experienced any attraction     for young men, but eventually married; though having much esteem     and affection for her husband, she never felt any but the     slightest sexual enjoyment in his arms, and then only by evoking     feminine images. This case, in which the sensations of an infant     at the breast formed the point of departure of a sexual     perversion which lasted through life, is, so far as I am aware,     unique.   FOOTNOTES:  [17] Jonas Cohn (_Allgemeine Æsthetik_, 1901, p. 11) lays it down that psychology has nothing to do with good or bad taste. \"The distinction between good and bad taste has no meaning for psychology. On this account, the fundamental conceptions of æsthetics cannot arise from psychology.\" It may be a question whether this view can be accepted quite absolutely.  [18] See Appendix A: \"The Origins of the Kiss.\"  [19] See J.B. Hellier, \"On the Nipple Reflex,\" _British Medical Journal_, November 7, 1896.

The Bath--Antagonism of Primitive Christianity to the Cult of the Skin--Its Cult of Personal Filth--The Reasons which Justified this Attitude--The World-wide Tendency to Association between Extreme Cleanliness and Sexual Licentiousness--The Immorality Associated with Public Baths in Europe down to Modern Times.   The hygiene of the skin, as well as its special cult, consists in bathing. The bath, as is well known, attained under the Romans a degree of development which, in Europe at all events, it has never reached before or since, and the modern visitor to Rome carries away with him no more impressive memory than that of the Baths of Caracalla. Since the coming of Christianity the cult of the skin, and even its hygiene, have never again attained the same general and unquestioned exaltation. The Church killed the bath. St. Jerome tells us with approval that when the holy Paula noted that any of her nuns were too careful in this matter she would gravely reprove them, saying that \"the purity of the body and its garments means the impurity of the soul.\"[21] Or, as the modern monk of Mount Athos still declares: \"A man should live in dirt as in a coat of mail, so that his soul may sojourn more securely within.\"      Our knowledge of the bathing arrangements of Roman days is     chiefly derived from Pompeii. Three public baths (two for both     men and women, who were also probably allowed to use the third     occasionally) have so far been excavated in this small town, as     well as at least three private bathing establishments (at least     one of them for women), while about a dozen houses contain     complete baths for private use. Even in a little farm house at     Boscoreale (two miles out of Pompeii) there was an elaborate     series of bathing rooms. It may be added that Pompeii was well     supplied with water. All houses but the poorest had flowing     jets, and some houses had as many as ten jets. (See Man's     _Pompeii_, Chapters XXVI-XXVIII.)      The Church succeeded to the domination of imperial Rome, and     adopted many of the methods of its predecessor. But there could     be no greater contrast than is presented by the attitude of     Paganism and of Christianity toward the bath.      As regards the tendencies of the public baths in imperial Rome,     some of the evidence is brought together in the section on this     subject in Rosenbaum's _Geschichte der Lustseuche im Alterthume_.     As regards the attitude of the earliest Christian ascetics in     this matter I may refer the reader to an interesting passage in     Lecky's _History of European Morals_ (vol. ii, pp. 107-112), in     which are brought together a number of highly instructive     examples of the manner in which many of the most eminent of the     early saints deliberately cultivated personal filth.      In the middle ages, when the extreme excesses of the early     ascetics had died out, and monasticiam became regulated, monks     generally took two baths a year when in health; in illness they     could be taken as often as necessary. The rules of Cluny only     allowed three towels to the community: one for the novices, one     for the professed, and one for the lay brothers. At the end of     the seventeenth century Madame de Mazarin, having retired to a     convent of Visitandines, one day desired to wash her feet, but     the whole establishment was set in an uproar at such an idea, and     she received a direct refusal. In 1760 the Dominican Richard     wrote that in itself the bath is permissible, but it must be     taken solely for necessity, not for pleasure. The Church taught,     and this lesson is still inculcated in convent schools, that it     is wrong to expose the body even to one's own gaze, and it is not     surprising that many holy persons boasted that they had never     even washed their hands. (Most of these facts have been taken     from A. Franklin, _Les Soins de Toilette_, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#0)"],["body","IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX, VOLUME V     Erotic Symbolism    The Mechanism of Detumescence    The Psychic State in Pregnancy  by  HAVELOCK ELLIS  1927        PREFACE.   In this volume the terminal phenomena of the sexual process are discussed, before an attempt is finally made, in the concluding volume, to consider the bearings of the psychology of sex on that part of morals which may be called \"social hygiene.\"  Under \"Erotic Symbolism\" I include practically all the aberrations of the sexual instinct, although some of these have seemed of sufficient importance for separate discussion in previous volumes. It is highly probable that many readers will consider that the name scarcely suffices to cover manifestations so numerous and so varied. The term \"sexual equivalents\" will seem preferable to some. While, however, it may be fully admitted that these perversions are \"sexual equivalents\"--or at all events equivalents of the normal sexual impulse--that term is merely a descriptive label which tells us nothing of the phenomena. \"Sexual Symbolism\" gives us the key to the process, the key that makes all these perversions intelligible. In all of them--very clearly in some, as in shoe-fetichism; more obscurely in others, as in exhibitionism--it has come about by causes congenital, acquired, or both, that some object or class of objects, some act or group of acts, has acquired a dynamic power over the psycho-physical mechanism of the sexual process, deflecting it from its normal adjustment to the whole of a beloved person of the opposite sex. There has been a transmutation of values, and certain objects, certain acts, have acquired an emotional value which for the normal person they do not possess. Such objects and acts are properly, it seems to me, termed symbols, and that term embodies the only justification that in most cases these manifestations can legitimately claim.  \"The Mechanism of Detumescence\" brings us at last to the final climax for which the earlier and more prolonged stage of tumescence, which has occupied us so often in these _Studies_, is the elaborate preliminary. \"The art of love,\" a clever woman novelist has written, \"is the art of preparation.\" That \"preparation\" is, on the physiological side, the production of tumescence, and all courtship is concerned in building up tumescence. But the final conjugation of two individuals in an explosion of detumescence, thus slowly brought about, though it is largely an involuntary act, is still not without its psychological implications and consequences; and it is therefore a matter for regret that so little is yet known about it. The one physiological act in which two individuals are lifted out of all ends that center in self and become the instrument of those higher forces which fashion the species, can never be an act to be slurred over as trivial or unworthy of study.  In the brief study of \"The Psychic State in Pregnancy\" we at last touch the point at which the whole complex process of sex reaches its goal. A woman with a child in her womb is the everlasting miracle which all the romance of love, all the cunning devices of tumescence and detumescence, have been invented to make manifest. The psychic state of the woman who thus occupies the supreme position which life has to offer cannot fail to be of exceeding interest from many points of view, and not least because the maternal instinct is one of the elements even of love between the sexes. But the psychology of pregnancy is full of involved problems, and here again, as so often in the wide field we have traversed, we stand at the threshold of a door it is not yet given us to pass.
