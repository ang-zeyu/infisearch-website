(_joyous at an idea that has seized him_) Eureka!  (_Runs to the table and from below it lifts a bulky manuscript._)  MAR. You've found it?  RUD. Yes. When genius is roused ideas come fast in flashes.  MAR. (_pointing to his picture_) Let's burn up the \"Red Sea.\"  RUD. No: think what a stench 'twould occasion! But my drama, my beautiful drama shall give us warmth.  MAR. (_with comic terror_) Intend you to read it? Twill chill us!  RUD. No. The paper in flame shall be burning, The soul to its heaven returning. (_with tragic emphasis_) Great loss! but the world yet must bear it, When Rome is in peril!  MAR. Great soul!  RUD. (_giving _MARCEL_ a portion of the MS._) Here, take the first act.  MAR. Well?  RUD. Tear it.  MAR. And light it.  (RUDOLPH _strikes a flint on steel, lights a candle, and goes to the stove with_ MARCEL; _together they set fire to a part of the MS. thrown into the fireplace; then both draw up their chairs and sit down, delightedly warming themselves._)  RUD. How joyous the rays!  MAR. How cheerful the blaze!  (_The door at the back opens violently, and_ COLLINE _enters frozen and nipped up, stamping his feet, and throwing angrily on the table a bundle of books tied up in a handkerchief_.)  COL. Surely miracles apocalyptic are dawning! For Christmas eve they honor by allowing no pawning!  (_Checks himself, seeing a fire in the stove._)  See I a fire here?  RUD. (_to_ COLLINE) Gently, it is my drama.  COL. In blazes! I find it very sparkling.  RUD. Brilliant! (_the fire languishes_)  COL. Too short its phrases.  RUD. Brevity's deemed a treasure.  COL. (_taking the chair from_ RUDOLPH) Your chair pray give me, author.  MAR. These foolish entr'actes merely make us shiver. Quickly!  RUD. (_taking another portion of the_ MS.) Here is the next act.  MAR. (_to_ COLLINE) Hush! not a whisper.  (RUDOLPH _tears up the_ MS. _and throws it into the fireplace; the flames revive._ COLLINE _moves his chair nearer and warms his hands._ RUDOLPH _is standing near the two with the rest of the_ MS.)  COL. How deep the thought is!  MAR. Color how true!  RUD. In that blue smoke my drama is dying Full of its love-scenes ardent and new.  COL. A leaf see crackle!  MAR. Those were all the kisses.  RUD. (_throwing the remaining_ MS. _on the fire_) Three acts at once I desire to hear.  COL. Only the daring can dream such visions.  RUD., MAR. and COL. Dreams that in flame soon disappear.  (_Applaud enthusiastically; the flame diminishes._)  MAR. Ye gods! see the leaves well-nigh perished.  COL. How vain is the drama we cherished.  MAR. They crackle! they curl up! they die!  MAR. and COL. The author--down with him, we cry.  (_From the middle door two boys enter, carrying provisions and fuel; the three friends turn, and with a surprised cry, seize the provisions and place them on the table._ COLLINE _carries the wood to the fireplace._)  RUD. Fuel!  MAR. Wine, too!  COL. Cigars!  RUD. Fuel!  MAR. Bordeaux!  RUD., MAR. and COL. The abundance of a feast day We are destined yet to know.  (_Exeunt the two boys_)  (_Enter_ SCHAUNARD.)  SCH. (_triumphantly throwing some coins on the ground_) Such wealth in the balance Outweighs the Bank of France.  COL. (_assisting_ RUDOLPH _and_ MARCEL _to pick up the coins_) Then, take them--then, take them.  MAR. (_incredulously_) Tin medals? Inspect them.  SCH. (_showing one to_ MARCEL) You're deaf then, or blear-eyed? What face do they show?  RUD. (_bowing_) King Louis Philippe: to my monarch I bow.  RUD., MAR., SCH. and COL. Shall King Louis Philippe at our feet thus lie low?  (SCHAUNARD _will go on recounting his good luck, but the others continue to arrange everything on the table._)  SCH. Now I'll explain. This gold has--or rather silver-- Has its own noble story.  MAR. First the stove to replenish.  COL. So much cold has he suffered,  SCH. 'Twas an Englishman, then-- Lord, or mi-lord, as may be-- Desired a musician.  MAR. (_throwing_ COLLINE'S _books from the table_) Off! Let us furnish the table.  SCH. I flew to him.  RUD. Where is the food?  COL. There.  MAR. Here.  SCH. I pay my homage. Accepted, I enquire--  COL. (_preparing the viands on the table while_ RUDOLPH _lights the other candle_) Here's cold roast beef.  MAR. And savory patty.  SCH. When shall we start the lessons? When I seek him, in answer to my question, \"When shall we start the lessons?\" He tells me \"Now--at once. Just look there,\" Showing a parrot on the first floor, hung, then continues: \"You must play until that bird has ceased to live.\" Thus it befell: Three days I play and yell.  RUD. Brilliantly lightens the room into splendor.  MAR. Here are the candles.  COL. What lovely pastry!  SCH. Then on the servant girl Try all the charms wherewith I'm laden; I fascinate the maiden.  MAR. With no tablecloth eat we--  RUD. (taking a paper from his pocket) An idea!  COL. and MAR. The Constitutional.  RUD. (unfolding the paper) Excellent paper! One eats a meal and swallows news at the same time!  SCH. With parsley I approach the bird, His beak Lorito opens; Lorito's wings outspread, Lorito opens his beak, A little piece of parsley gulps-- As Socrates, is dead!  (SCHAUNARD, seeing that no one is paying any attention to him, seizes COLLINE as he passes with a plate.)  COL. Who?  SCH. (pettishly) The devil fly away with you entirely!  (seeing the rest in the act of eating the cold pastry)  What are you doing?  (With solemn gesture, extending his hand over the pastry)  No! dainties of this kind Are but the stored-up fodder Saved for the morrow, Fraught with gloom and sorrow, (clearing the table) To dine at home on the day of Christmas vigil, While the Quartier Latin embellishes Its ways with dainty food and tempting relishes. Meanwhile the smell of savory fritters The old street fills with fragrant odor. There singing joyously, merry maidens hover, Having for echo each a student lover.  (RUDOLPH locks the door; then all go to the table and pour out wine.)  RUD., MAR. and COL. 'Tis the gladsome Christmas Eve.  SCH. A little of religion, comrades, I pray; Within doors drink we, but we dine away.  (Two knocks are heard at the door.)  BEN. (from without) 'Tis I.  MAR. Who is there?  BEN. 'Tis Benoit.  MAR. 'Tis the landlord is knocking!  SCH. Bolt the door quickly!  COL. (calling towards the door) No! There is no one!  SCH. 'Tis fastened!  BEN. Give me a word, pray!  SCH. (opening the door, after consulting with his friends) At once.  BEN. (entering smilingly, showing a paper to MARCEL) The rent!  MAR. (with great cordiality) Hallo! give him a seat, friends!  BEN. Do not trouble, I beg you.  SCH. (with gentle firmness, obliging BENOIT to sit down) Sit down!  MAR. (offering BENOIT a glass of wine) Some Bordeaux?  RUD. Your health!  BEN. Thank you.  COL. Your health!  SCH. Drink up!  RUD. Good health! (all drink)  BEN. (to MARCEL, putting down his glass and showing his paper.) 'Tis the quarter's rent I call for.  MAR. (ingenuously) Glad to hear it.  BEN. And therefore--  SCH. (interrupting) Another tipple? (fills up the glasses)  BEN. Thank you.  RUD. Your health!  COL. Your health!  RUD., MAR., SCH. and COL. (all touching BENOIT'S glass) Drink we all your health, sir! (all drink)  BEN. (resuming, to MARCEL) To you I come, as the quarter now is ended; You have promised,  MAR. To keep it I intended. (Shows BENOIT the money on the table.)  RUD. (aside to MARCEL) Art mad?  SCH. (aside to MARCEL) What do you--  MAR. (to BENOIT, without noticing the two) Hast seen it? Then give your care a respite, And join our friendly circle. Tell me how many years Boast you of, my dear sir?  BEN. My years! Spare me, I pray.  RUD. Our own age, less or more?  BEN. (protesting) Much more, very much more.  (While they make BENOIT talk, they fill up his glass immediately it is empty.)  COL. He says 'tis less or more.  MAR. (mischievously, in a low voice) T'other evening at Mabille I caught him in a passage of love.  BEN. (uneasily) Me!  MAR. At Mabille. T'other evening I caught you. Deny?  BEN. By chance 'twas.  MAR. (in a flattering tone) She was lovely!  BEN. (half drunk, suddenly) Ah! very.  SCH. Old rascal!  RUD. Old rascal!  COL. Vile seducer!  SCH. Old rascal!  MAR. He's an oak tree. He's a cannon.  RUD. He has good taste, then?  BEN. (laughing) Ha, ha!  MAR. Her hair was curly auburn.  COL. Old knave!  MAR. With ardent speed leaped he joyous to her embraces.  BEN. (with increasing exultation) Old am I, but robust yet.  RUD., SCH. and COL. Ardent with joy he sprang to her embraces.  MAR. To him she yields her woman's love and truth.  BEN. (in a very confidential tone) Bashful was I in youth, Now somewhat am I altered. Well, what I like myself ... Must know that my one delight ... Is a merry damsel,--and small, I do not ask a whale, nor a world-map to study, Nor, like a full moon, A face round and ruddy; But leanness, downright leanness, No! No! Lean women's claws oftentimes are scratchy, Their temper somewhat catchy, Full of aches, too, and mourning, As my wife is my warning.  (MARCEL bangs his fist down on the table and rises; the others follow his example, BENOIT looking on in bewilderment.)  MAR. A wife possessing! Yet thoughts impure confessing.  SCH. and COL. Foul shame!  RUD. His vile pollution empoisons our honest abode.  SCH. and COL. Hence!  MAR. With perfume we must fumigate!  COL. Drive him forth, the reprobate!  SCH. Morality offended hence expels you!  (BENOIT staggeringly rises, and tries in vain to speak.)  BEN. But say--I say!  MAR. Be silent!  COL. Be silent!  RUD. Be silent!  (They surround BENOIT and gradually push him to the door.)  BEN. Sirs, I beg you!  MAR., SCH. and COL. Be silent, out, your lordship! Hence away!  RUD., MAR., SCH. and COL. Wish we your lordship a pleasant Christmas Eve. Ah!  (They push BENOIT outside the door.)  MAR. (locking the door) I have paid the last quarter!  SCH. In the Quartier Latin Momus awaits!  MAR.

The first chance I can find, I will make acquaintance with a beard eraser! So guide me to the monstrous outrage of a barber's weapon. Let's go!  SCH. We go!  MAR. and COL. We go!  RUD. I stay here, finish I must the article for my new journal, \"Beaver\"!  MAR. Be quick then!  RUD. Five minutes only, I know well the work!  COL. We'll await you at the porter's lodge!  MAR. Delay, and you'll hear the chorus!  RUD. Five minutes only!  SCH. You must cut short the Beaver's growing tale!

(_standing on the threshold with an extinguished candle and a key_) Pray, would you--  RUD. Pray be seated a moment.  MIMI. No, I thank you.  RUD. I beg you enter.  (MIMI _enters, but is seized with a fit of coughing_.)  RUD. Are you not well?  MIMI. No! Nothing!  RUD. You are quite pale!  MIMI. (coughing) My breath--'tis the staircase--  (Swoons, and RUDOLPH has hardly time to support her and place her on a chair. She lets fall her candlestick and key.)  RUD. What can I do to aid her?  (Fetches some water, and sprinkles her face.)  Ah! this! How very pale her face is! (Mimi revives) Do you feel better?  MIMI. Yes.  RUD. Here 'tis very chilly. Nearer the fire be seated an instant. (conducting her to a chair near the tire) A little wine?  MIMI. Thank you.  RUD. (giving her a glass and pouring out some wine) For you.  MIMI. Not so much, please!  RUD. Like this?  MIMI. Thank you.

Thank you. Now, good evening.  RUD. So, good evening.  (Accompanies her to the door, and then returns quickly to his work.)  MIMI. (re-entering, stops on the threshold) Oh! how stupid! How stupid! The key of my poor chamber, Where can I have left it?  RUD. Come, stand not in the doorway: Your candle is flickering in the wind.  (Mimi's light goes out.)  MIMI. Good gracious! Please light it just once more!  (RUDOLPH runs with his candle, but, as he nears the door, his light, too, is blown out, and the room remains in darkness.)  RUD. Oh, dear! Now there's mine gone out, too!  MIMI. Ah! and the key--where can it be?  (Groping about, she reaches the table and deposits the candlestick.)  RUD. What a nuisance! (He finds himself near the door and fastens it.)  MIMI. I'm so sorry.  RUD. Where can it be?  MIMI. You have an importunate neighbor, Pray, forgive your tiresome little neighbor.  RUD. Nothing, I assure you.  MIMI. Pray, forgive your tiresome neighbor.  RUD. Do not mention it, I pray you.  MIMI. Look for it.  RUD. I'm looking.  (Looks for the key on the floor; sliding over it, he knocks against the table, deposits his candlestick, and searches for the key with his hands on the floor.)  MIMI. Where can it be?  (Finds the key, lets an exclamation escape, then checks himself and puts the key in his pocket.)  RUD. Ah!  MIMI. Have you found it?  RUD. No.  MIMI. I think so.  RUD. In very truth.  MIMI. Found it?  RUD. Not yet.  (Feigns to search, but guided by Mimi'S voice and movements, approaches her; as Mimi is stooping his hand meets hers, which he clasps.)  MIMI. (rising to her feet, surprised) Ah!  RUD. (holding Mimi's hand, with emotion) Your tiny hand is frozen, Let me warm it into life; Our search is useless, In darkness all is hidden, 'Ere long the light of the moon shall aid us, Yes, in the moonlight our search let us resume. One moment, pretty maiden, While I tell you in a trice, Who I am, what I do, And how I live. Shall I?  (Mimi is silent.)  I am, I am a poet! What's my employment? Writing. Is that a living? Hardly. I've wit though wealth be wanting, Ladies of rank and fashion All inspire me with passion; In dreams and fond illusions, Or castles in the air, Richer is none on earth than I.  Bright eyes as yours, believe me, Steal my priceless jewels, In fancy's store-house cherished, Your roguish eyes have robbed me, Of all my dreams bereft me, Dreams that are fair, yet fleeting. Fled are my truant fancies, Regrets I do not cherish, For now life's rosy morn is breaking, Now golden love is waking. Now that I've told my story, Pray tell me yours, too; Tell me frankly, who are you? Say, will you tell?  MIMI. (_after some hesitation_) They call me Mimi But my name is Lucia; My story is a short one-- Fine satin stuffs or silk I deftly embroider; I am content and happy; The rose and lily I make for pastime. These flowers give me pleasure As in magical accents They speak to me of love, Of beauteous springtime. Of fancies and of visions bright they tell me, Such as poets, and only poets, know. Do you hear me?  RUD. Yes!  MIMI. They call me Mimi, But I know not why; All by myself I take my frugal supper, To Mass not oft repairing, Yet oft I pray to God. In my room live I lonely, Up at the top there, in my little chamber Above the house tops so lofty. Yet the glad sun first greets me; After the frost is over Spring's first, sweet, fragrant kiss is mine, Her first bright sunbeam is mine, A rose as her petals are opening Do I tenderly cherish. Ah! what a charm Lies for me in her fragrance! Alas! those flowers I make, The flowers I fashion, alas! they have no perfume! More than just this I cannot find to tell you, I'm a tiresome neighbor that at an awkward moment intrudes upon you.  SCH. (_from below_) Eh! Rudolph!  COL. Rudolph!  MAR. Hallo! you hear not? Don't dawdle!  (_At the shouts of his friends_ RUDOLPH _is annoyed._)  COL. Poetaster, come!  SCH. What has happened, idler?  (_Getting more annoyed_ RUDOLPH _opens the window to answer his friends; the moonlight enters, brightening the room._)  RUD. I have still three lines to finish.  MIMI. (_approaching the window_) Who are they?  RUD. My friends.  SCH. You will know they're yours.  MAR. What do you there, so lonely?  RUD. I'm not lonely. We are two. So to Momus go on. There keep us places; we will follow quickly.  (_Remains still at the window to make sure of his friends going._)  MAR., SCH. and COL. (_gradually departing_) Momus, Momus, Momus! Gently and soft to supper let us go.  MAR. And poetry let flow.  SCH. and COL. Momus, Momus, Momus!  (MIMI _goes nearer the window, so that the moon's rays fall on her while_ RUDOLPH _contemplates her ecstatically._)  RUD. Lovely maid in the moonlight!  MAR. And poetry let flow.  RUD. Your face entrancing. Like radiant seraph from on high appears! The dream that I would ever, ever dream, returns.

Love binds us in his fetters.      |  (_yielding to her lover's (_placing his arm around MIMI_         embrace_) Love now shall rule our hearts     | Sweet to my soul the magic voice  alone,                            | Of love its music chanteth, Life's fairest flower is love!     | Life's fairest flower is love! Life's fairest flower is love!     |   (RUDOLPH _kisses her._)   MIMI. (_disengaging herself_) No, I pray you!  RUD. My sweetheart!  MIMI. Your comrades await you!  RUD. Do you then dismiss me?  MIMI. I should like--no, I dare not!  RUD. Say!  MIMI. (coquettishly) Could I not come with you?  RUD. What, Mimi? It would be much more pleasant here to stay. Outside 'tis chilly!  MIMI. To you I'll be neighbor! I'll be always near you.  RUD. On returning?  MIMI. (archly) Who knows, sir?  RUD. Take my arm, my little maiden!  MIMI. (giving her arm to RUDOLPH) I obey you, my lord!
