They also believe we are here on the same mission and already they have attempted to disable and sink our boat.\"  Frank stopped in alarm. Glancing hurriedly about he grasped Jack's arm and in a trembling tone entreated him to leave the vicinity at his earliest opportunity. Jack's answer was a negative shake of his head. His companions also indicated their disapproval of the course.  \"Well, here's the flounder,\" announced Frank at last picking up a fine specimen of that denizen of the Gulf waters. \"He's a beauty.\"  The boys gathered about the fish admiring and investigating the peculiarities already mentioned by Frank. At last Harry spoke:  \"But he wouldn't be good raw and you had to have a fire. I'm always interested in seeing fire produced from a stick.\"  \"Oh, that's not so difficult,\" Frank answered; \"watch me.\"  Kneeling on the sand he grasped his fire stick in his left hand after placing the bowstring in position. With a shell over the upper end of the stick, he sawed away busily for a moment. A tiny wreath of smoke eddied away from the lower end of the stick.  \"Hurray,\" cried Harry, \"You're fetching it. I can see it coming around the bend. Just look at that, boys. I can see it coming.\"  \"Put up your hands,\" came a coarse voice from the rear.  Startled, the lads with one accord jumped to their feet to see their guest of a short time previous pointing an automatic at them.  \"Drop that gun,\" came an order in Tom's ringing voice.       CHAPTER VII  THEIR PIRATE PRISONER   With an exclamation of surprise and alarm all eyes were turned in Tom's direction. With a steady hand he was leveling an automatic pistol at the head of the outlaw who now dropped his pistol hand to his side without, however, relinquishing his hold upon the weapon. His shifty eyes were closely watching the boy.  \"I'll not tell you again!\" warned Tom. \"Once is plenty.\"  \"Yes, I heard you the first time!\" gritted the outlaw, opening his hand and permitting the weapon to drop to the sand. \"You wait! You Yankees can't come down here and have your own way always.\"  \"We won't argue that point just now,\" was Tom's rejoinder. \"Right now, you'll please put your hands up over your head.\" Then as the outlaw obeyed, Tom added--\"Way up with 'em. Pick me a star or two out of the sky. Keep 'em up there and watch a comet while one of my friends goes through you for souvenirs of the occasion.\"  As Jack stepped forward to search the captive, Frank took a closer look at the dark face and bruised nose, then cried out:  \"Why, Wyckoff, how did you get back here?\"  \"Is this your friend Wyckoff?\" questioned Jack, turning to Frank before continuing his task of searching their involuntary guest.  \"This is the man who warned me back and who marooned me on this lonely island!\" declared Frank with some heat. \"I know him!\"  \"That settles it!\" stated Jack in a determined tone. \"He's going to get all that's coming to him if I have a vote here!\"  \"Here, too!\" chorused the others. \"Here's where he gets his.\"  \"Remember, boys, we're Boy Scouts!\" cautioned Jack. \"No harsh measures will be permitted. Justice may be necessary--no more.\"  A murmur of approval that ran around the little group showed that the boys heartily favored Jack's sentiment in the matter.  Under cover of Tom's leveled automatic Wyckoff, for it was he, remained passive while Jack searched his pockets, producing therefrom the missing flashlight made to imitate an automatic pistol, a watch, a purse with some coins inside, a vile smelling pipe with a pouch of tobacco, a stubby lead pencil and a note book partly filled with figures and memoranda. Apparently there was nothing of value.  \"Aside from the flashlight and the real automatic pistol, I can't find that he's taken anything of our property,\" Jack said when the search was completed. \"I guess we'd better return his own property to him. We don't want his money and wouldn't use his pipe.\"  \"Now let's tie him up!\" Arnold suggested. \"I think it would be wise to sew him down to the sand. He's a slippery fellow.\"  \"Good idea!\" laughed Frank. \"But tying is better all round.\"  \"What shall we tie him with?\" asked Tom. \"I have nothing.\"  \"Why, come to think of it,\" Harry put in, \"how did you get ashore, anyway? Last we knew of you, you were guarding the Fortuna.\"  \"While you lads were up the beach after that horseshoe crab,\" explained Tom, \"I sat on the roof of the cabin with the glasses. I thought I saw a figure stealing along in the shelter of those pines to the eastward of this spot and after a while I made him out. The glasses showed that it was our last visitor on board the Fortuna. So I knew he'd bear watching, as they say, and I went below to get a gun for emergency. When I came out again, he was real close, and I saw what he intended to do. I simply started the engines, slipped the cable and ran the Fortuna high and dry on shore, tumbled over the bow and arrived in time to checkmate his little game. I'm glad, too!\"  \"So are we!\" heartily agreed the boys with one accord.  \"But what are we to do with this chap?\" queried Jack. \"It rather worries me. He's apt to be a white elephant on our hands.\"  \"It would serve him good and right,\" began Arnold, \"and be only justice, too, if we marooned him on this very island where he left Frank. I think that's the best way out of the whole thing.\"  \"Let's set the chap down by the fire,\" Tom suggested, \"while we argue it out. There's still a little raw edge on the wind.\"  Tom was right, and although the fog of the morning had gone, the air was still damp and the wind from the Gulf was heavy with moisture that chilled the boys when not in motion. Accordingly, following the lad's suggestion, they directed their steps toward one of the fires kindled earlier by Frank. There they seated themselves while Tom with one automatic and Jack with another watched Wyckoff.  \"Perhaps the prisoner at the bar may have a suggestion in the premises,\" ventured Frank. \"We want to be square with you, Wyckoff, even if you have treated us exceedingly unkind.\"  \"I want you fellows to take your gear and go back north!\" shouted Wyckoff in an angry tone. \"I'll fix you yet for this!\"  \"We have a right to be here,\" Jack put in, \"so long as we don't harm anyone. We are merely tourists out for a pleasure trip.\"  \"You lie!\" almost screamed Wyckoff. \"You're after the Spanish Chest, but you shall never have it! It belongs to me!\"  In his excitement the prisoner almost forgot himself and shook his fist at Jack threateningly, rising to his feet meanwhile.  \"Sit down!\" Tom's voice, although calm, carried a world of meaning to the excited man whose glance toward Tom took in the unwavering blue muzzle of the Weapon in his captor's hand.  \"Suppose for the sake of argument that we were after this mythical chest of treasure whose value has been without doubt multiplied many times in the retailing of its story,\" Jack argued, \"does that imply that we are committing a crime against you? Have you any more claim on the chest that you mention than we have?\"  \"Yes!\" shouted the angry Wyckoff. \"I am a lineal descendant from the Spaniards who buried it. It is mine because it is in the family. I don't know what word you educated Yankees would use, but it is mine because it belonged to my father's father's father.\"  \"I know,\" spoke up Arnold; \"you mean you have inherited it?\"  \"Yes, that's it,\" agreed Wyckoff. \"Besides that, you will never be able to get the treasure. It is cursed to anyone but a person of Spanish blood. I am part Spaniard and it is mine.\"  \"Well, we might consider going back in the face of such argument,\" said Frank, appearing to agree with Wyckoff, \"but what did you do with my chum? I won't go away and leave him, you know.\"  \"Your partner and your boat are both safe,\" declared Wyckoff. \"When we know that you are ready to leave, we'll bring you all together again, but not before. You'll never see him again otherwise.\"  \"Why, what would happen to him?\" questioned Frank in amazement.  Wyckoff drew his thumb across his throat with a suggestive move.  The boys shuddered as they grasped the significance of his meaning. Their glances, met and instinctively they shrank away from the prisoner, who seemed to enjoy their discomfiture immensely.  \"I've heard great tales about this treasure chest since I came down here,\" stated Frank at last. \"What is this I hear about the one who discovers the chest having to keep very quiet while he's digging? Is there anything at all in that story or not?\"  \"It is said,\" stated Wyckoff, \"that the one for whom the treasure is destined must not utter a word while digging for it. Also, he must come with clean hands. You understand what I mean? That is why you boys are yet alive. My hands have not yet been--\"  \"Well, if they have not,\" interrupted Tom indignantly, \"it is no fault of your own, old chap. You surely tried your level best to put the Fortuna and her crew under the water. Take it from me!\"  \"And yet he raves about his clean hands, the dirty scoundrel!\" cried Harry. \"Why, if we were only afloat, we'd make him walk a plank!\"  \"That reminds me,\" Tom put in. \"The Fortuna lies on the beach unless she's worked herself loose, and it may be some job to get her off.\"  \"Suppose you stay here and mount guard over the prisoner,\" suggested Jack, \"while we go back and look after the vessel. We'll return when we've gotten everything ship shape and Bristol fashion.\"  \"Suits me fine!\" declared Tom. \"And I hope this angelic prisoner tries to escape while you're gone! That would be fine!\"  \"Tom, you're bloodthirsty, I believe!\" laughed Jack indulgently. \"I know the provocation is severe, but remember that you're a Boy Scout.\"  \"You wouldn't leave me on this island, would you?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13859"],["title","Boy Scouts in Southern Waters; Or, Spaniard's Treasure Chest (#8)"],["body","Wyckoff when the boys had departed for the boat. \"That would be cruel.\"  \"But you marooned Frank here, didn't you?\" asked Tom angrily. \"Why would it be any worse for you than for him? Tell me that.\"  \"I told the men to leave him provisions and matches. I have no matches nor provisions. I cannot make a fire with sticks, as he did,\" replied the prisoner in an humble and whining tone intended to placate.  \"Well,\" Tom considered, \"we might leave you some matches and some grub. You could find plenty of wood hereabouts, couldn't you?\"  \"There's plenty of wood here if one could work it up,\" replied Wyckoff. \"The storms have washed ashore thousands of pieces of planks and timbers of all sorts. Why, once I came out to one of the islands and found a fine boat washed ashore by a storm. It was perfectly sound and tight, too. There's plenty of timber here to make one rich if he could only salvage it and get it to market.\"  \"Then if we leave you a box of matches and some canned goods,\" Tom argued, \"you'd be a lot better off than Frank was.\"  A shout from the direction of the Fortuna indicated that something was taking place there. Wyckoff glanced hastily in that direction. Tom's first impulse was to look that way, also, but his training stood him in good stead. By a magnificent effort of will he kept his eyes fastened on the prisoner, who stared intently toward the Fortuna as if fascinated by what he saw. Thus they sat for a moment or two. Then Tom regained his composure. Wyckoff glanced out of the corner of his eye narrowly at his guard. Tom laughed.  \"You didn't want the provisions badly enough to wait for them, did you, you old fox?\" he taunted. \"You wanted me to look away for a minute and then you'd have gone looking for provisions alone.\"  \"You do me an injustice, lad,\" replied Wyckoff meekly.  \"All right; I apologize; but the gun is in working order just the same, and don't you forget it. It's still on the job.\"  Wyckoff's glance was baleful and full of venom as he controlled himself with a visible effort. Hatred seemed to ooze from him as he sat quiet very much against his will.  Another shout from the boat gave with its note of triumph a message that the boys were meeting success in their efforts to get the Fortuna off the beach. Wyckoff looked intently that way.  \"Ha!\" he ejaculated. \"They're fetching it! Good boys!\"  In spite of his resolve to keep his eyes on the prisoner, Tom's gaze wandered for an instant to the sight viewed by Wyckoff.  That instant seemed to be the object of the outlaw's vigil.  The boys on the Fortuna had, by dint of great exertion, managed to work the yacht from her resting place on the beach where Tom had driven her in his mad race to rescue them a short time previously. Because of the short distance traveled, the momentum of the boat had not been sufficient to drive her far up on the beach, so it was not a difficult matter to get her afloat again. The powerful motors tugged and pulled and at last they were again afloat, but minus their anchor.  Frank offered to dive for it, and, divesting himself of his clothing, went overboard in the clear water of the little bight where the anchor and cable could be seen lying on the bottom.  The shout of triumph voiced by the boys when the Fortuna floated free was echoed when Frank came to the surface after having bent on the line he carried to the end of the chain cable. He was nearly breathless when he reached the surface, but willing hands pulled him over the stern of the rowboat in which the boys had searched for the lost anchor. Soon he recovered his wind.  Peace seemed never to reign for long in the Fortuna. Scarcely had the boys shouted in victory over the recovery of the anchor than they heard a shot from the shore. Harry, from his position on the pilot house, gesticulated and pointed inland in a frenzy.       CHAPTER VIII  JACK STRICKEN BY A BULLET   \"What's up now?\" cried Jack from the rowboat.  \"That villain has shot Tom and is running away across the island!\" cried Arnold from his position. \"Tom's lying on the sand!\"  \"Great Double-Barreled Wiggle-Headed Pollywogs!\" ejaculated Harry. \"Excuse my French, but this is too much. If he's killed Tom, I'll resign from the Boy Scouts for a few minutes. I will so!\"  \"Pull for the shore, boys!\" urged Jack. \"Get into your clothes, Frank!\" And then, before either of his orders could be obeyed, he seized the oars and pulled the boat with lusty strokes toward the beach, intent on capturing the outlaw if possible. Great sobs escaped him as he worked manfully at the oars.  Each boy at that moment was mentally blaming himself for the tragedy he was sure would await their arrival at the scene of the campfire. Each one felt that he should have remained to guard the captive outlaw who was so evidently desperate because of his situation.  But Jack's exertions were unnecessary. Before the rowboat reached the sand, a flash of white had appeared over the bows of the Fortuna, a great splash of water gave evidence of a heavy body launched from the deck, and a commotion betokened a swimmer in action.  \"Good old boy!\" cried Frank with a sob in his throat.  \"That never was Arnold!\" cried Harry aghast at the thought of his chum venturing into the water alone on such a quest.  \"Not on your life!\" Jack protested. \"That was our one and only. Old Rowdy is on the job with both feet. He's going ashore for business, too. I believe that dog actually knows things!\"  \"Heaven help that poor wretch if Rowdy gets to him first!\" cried Harry. \"Rowdy has more enthusiasm than caution, and he's apt to get rough. I wouldn't be surprised to find Wyckoff all strung around the island in small pieces when we get there.\"  In a short time the nose of the rowboat grounded on the beach.  The three boys leaped out and raced quickly to their fallen chum. Tom was struggling to rise from his prone position. Far across the sands the fleeing figure of the outlaw was being rapidly overtaken by the enraged bulldog, who sensed the situation and who apparently was determined to overtake and punish the escaped prisoner.  \"Are you hurt, Tom?\" queried Jack in a shaking tone.  \"I guess so,\" Tom replied in a dazed manner. \"No, I don't think I am,\" he corrected himself. \"That is,\" he continued, \"I don't know just what happened. I heard you cry out, and as I turned to look, the explosion took place. What happened, anyway?\"  \"From the look of your jaw, Wyckoff must have landed a sweeping kick just where the knockout nerve is located,\" explained Frank.  \"Try to shut your teeth,\" suggested Harry. \"If you can shut your teeth all right, nothing serious is to be feared.\"  Tom made the effort, but winced with pain. A grimace stole over his countenance and his hand went up to the injured jaw.  \"That hurts, doesn't it?\" solicitously inquired Jack.  \"Not much,\" bravely protested Tom. \"The most trouble is that I can shut the front teeth, but the back ones don't seem to meet by half an inch or more. The jaw must be dislocated.\"  In spite of their sympathy the boys could not restrain a laugh.  \"I guess that if your front teeth come together your back ones meet,\" Jack assured the injured boy. \"Let's look for Wyckoff.\"  \"You mean let's look for Wyckoff's remains!\" Harry tried to put in, but he was stopped by a gesture from Frank.  \"Let's not make it any more horrible than it is. That man is desperate and I'm afraid of him,\" he whispered as they helped Tom to his feet and started away in the direction taken by the outlaw.  \"I can't see him anywhere,\" Harry asserted. \"I'll bet Rowdy has eaten him up body, boots and breeches. Serve him right, too!\"  \"We're the bloodthirsty bunch!\" declared Jack. \"It must be some quality in the atmosphere down here. This is the old region infested by Captain Kidd and his buccaneers. They must have left something in the way of a piratical germ in the atmosphere.\"  \"Maybe so, but I'd like to find that dog just now,\" stoutly declared Harry. \"He's had one big meal even if the quality was poor.\"  \"Follow his tracks,\" suggested Frank. \"That's easy in this sand. See, here they go. My word, but he was taking long jumps.\"  \"He left in such a hurry that he didn't take my automatic,\" declared Tom. \"I guess when he hit me or kicked me I must have closed on the trigger and started the thing going. He left without waiting to take the gun away from me. I'm glad of that, too.\"  \"I see him!\" joyfully shouted Frank, who was slightly in the lead. \"Here he is, and Rowdy is mounting guard. Good old dog.\"  It was even as Frank had said. Rowdy had overtaken the fleeing villain and brought him to earth. Now he was walking about the prostrate form, occasionally stepping in and taking a nip at an arm or a leg. Wyckoff, thoroughly cowed, was begging and whining at a great rate. At the approach of the boys he begged piteously.  \"Let him get up, Rowdy!\" commanded Jack. \"Now, Wyckoff,\" he ordered when the dog had permitted that worthy to regain his feet, \"You 'bout face and back to the campfire on the double quick. It's getting toward evening and we can't lay around here all night waiting on you. We want you for a little while yet.\"  Wyckoff's appeals for mercy were piteous. All the way to the campfire he begged that the boys would show him mercy, but no response was made. Rowdy trotted along beside the outlaw with a satisfied air. Now and again he would look up at Wyckoff's face and then make as if to take a bite of the man's leg. At such times Wyckoff would involuntarily quicken his gait until cautioned by Jack to go more steadily. This was very hard for him to do, for he was frightened.  \"Frank,\" Tom asked when the little party arrived at the fire, \"did you see anything of a boat on shore here during your visit?\"  \"Come to think of it, I certainly did,\" replied Frank. \"It is a dandy, too. I had made up my mind to try to drag it to the water and row to the mainland if no one came soon, but your arrival drove all thoughts of it from me. It is back here just a short"]]]
