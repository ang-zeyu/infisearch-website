Harry shut his eyes, turned his head side-wise and gasped for breath. Reaching out for the jacket he took it from the hand of his friend and tried to push it into the hole through which the water was pouring steadily. His efforts were fruitless.  \"Here, take this,\" urged Arnold. \"This fid will plug a big hole and jam it tight, too. Is it a butt started?\"  Harry took the fid from his chum. Quickly he inserted the pointed end into the hole he had been trying to cover with his hand.  \"Give me a hammer or something to knock with and I'll try to drive this into the hole. It's not a butt, it's an auger hole!\"  \"An auger hole?\" both boys gasped in horror.  \"An auger hole!\" repeated Harry, his lips set and white. \"Just a little more and we'd have been beyond all help. I think this idea of helping unfortunate castaways is getting to be a good thing.\"  \"Why, who on earth could have been so cold-blooded as to have bored a hole in our vessel?\" cried Arnold. \"Surely it wasn't the man whose life we just saved a short time ago!\"  \"I came into this cabin,\" asserted Harry \"and could hear the rush of water. I thought the leak must be here. Of course, I thought at first that we had started a butt in the rolling a while back, when our friend Carlos Sneakodorus Madero boarded us and left us.\"  \"But that seems impossible,\" incredulously offered Tom. \"The Fortuna was built at Manitowoc where they have a reputation of doing first class work and she hasn't had rough handling at all.\"  \"It was impossible!\" cried Harry. \"Just as I knelt to raise the floor board I saw that auger lying there. Then as I raised the board, I saw a handful of white chips float up through the hole.\"  \"And then you saw the stream of water?\" queried Arnold.  \"That's all there is to it, except the fact that the life-belts are pulled from their places on the ceiling,\" answered Harry.  \"Sure enough, they're down in a heap,\" declared Arnold.  \"And if you count them,\" Harry continued, \"I'll wager my next meal that you'll find one missing. I can also guess who is wearing it at this moment if he hasn't thrown it away!\"  \"Do you mean the man we picked up--the man who was knocked off the schooner?\" breathlessly queried the younger boy.  \"That's the man we want!\" announced Harry. \"And maybe I won't do a thing to him when I lay hands on him. Boy Scout or not, I'll put a dent in his dome that'll hold coffee like a saucer!\"  \"Will that fid hold?\" questioned Tom examining the spot.  \"No, I don't think it will,\" was Harry's reply. \"We'd better get a plug of that soft pine in the lazarette, then when it gets soaked it'll swell and hold tight. This fid's made of hard wood. It may hold all right for a while, but it'll work loose just when it should hold. If you'll get the pine, Arnold, I'll make a plug.\"  Arnold hastened to bring the wood while Tom looked to the pumps and examined the cabin for further damage.  \"He got an automatic or two from the locker in the kitchenette,\" he announced returning to the after cabin after his search.  \"If he took those two lying on the lower shelf,\" announced Harry, \"he got only one automatic! That's a joke on him.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" Arnold asked returning with the desired piece of wood. \"If the man took two, he took only one!\"  \"Because\" explained Harry fitting the plug into place, \"the other is a flashlight made in the shape of an automatic.\"  Laughing over the joke unconsciously played upon himself by their late visitor, the boys repaired to the pilot house where the gravity of the situation was repeated to Jack, who had been at the wheel controlling the movements of the Fortuna and keeping a lookout.  \"I was examining the coast a moment ago with the glasses and saw what I took to be a man wading ashore back of our present position,\" explained Jack. \"He looked as if he had on a life belt, but I couldn't be sure because I couldn't hold the glasses steady and handle the boat, too. Suppose one of you take the glasses and see what you can make out along the shore line in both directions.\"  Tom took the binoculars, mounted to the cabin roof, and swept diligently the shore line in both directions.  \"What can you make out?\" inquired Jack from the pilot house.  \"I see a fellow just as you described, only he's not wearing a life belt. He seems to be crossing the strip of beach sand to the fringe of pines a short distance inland. I don't see any automatic flashlight in his hand, though!\" whimsically announced the watching lad. \"Then on the other hand, I can see two smokes that look like a Boy Scout call for help and between the two fires I can see a Boy Scout running back and forth and waving his hat.\"  \"How do you know he's a Boy Scout?\" challenged Harry.  \"Well, if he started Boy Scout signals, he'd be a Boy Scout, wouldn't he?\" replied Tom. Besides, he's red headed like Arnold and homely like Harry and kind hearted like Jack and good like Tom. That's enough for me.\"  \"You're just right, that's enough for you!\" declared Harry. \"You may throw on your shovel--you've got a load.\"  \"Honest, now, Tom,\" put in Jack, \"what's the straight of this? Quit your nonsense! We must be serious.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Tom. \"What I said is all so except the foolishness. I can't see what the boy looks like. I can just make out a figure between the two fires. It looks slight like a boy. That's all I can make out. There are some trees over there just this side of the fires, and it looks as if we could make a landing close up to the fires. There seems to be a little bay there.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Jack in a tone of relief. \"We'll run close in and try to find out what's the matter. Maybe the stranger can help us get our bearings. Lucky the fog lifted when it did or we would have piled up high and dry on this beach!\"  As the Fortuna approached the little bight indicated by Tom, they discovered that there would be plenty of water to enable the Fortuna to run close inshore and permit of their landing easily. Tom and Harry busied themselves with clearing away one of the metal boats carried on the cabin roof and preparing to lower it when the Fortuna should come to rest. Upon completing their task, Tom stood up for another view of the beach which they were approaching.  \"Look, Jack!\" he cried. \"Can you see the boy over there wig-wagging at us? Isn't that the Boy Scout wig-wag?\"  \"Sure enough, it is!\" declared Jack excitedly. \"Take this flag and answer him. You're in a good place up there.\"  He passed the flag up to Tom as he spoke. All four lads watched with intentness the figure on the beach, while Tom prepared to reply to his further signals with his flag grasped in both hands.  \"He's got two flags, I believe,\" announced Tom.  \"He's going to use the Semaphore code, then!\" declared Jack.  \"There it comes!\" cried Harry. \"He's calling us! Answer him.\"  \"All right, Scout!\" assented Tom. \"Here comes the message!\"  \"Right arm at head, left arm down in front--that's 'D,'\" announced Harry who was watching with the glasses. \"Then right and left both down and diagonal to the right--that's 'A.' Next both arms diagonally down away from the body--that's 'N.' Oh, he's telling us his name--Dan! Hurray! He's introducing himself!\"  \"Here comes the rest,\" cried Harry excitedly, \"both arms diagonally downward and to the left--that's 'G.' Now the right down in front and left diagonally up and out from the shoulder--that's 'E.' Next both arms out horizontally from the body--that's 'R.' Why, that spells 'DANGER!' What does that mean?\"  \"Search me!\" declared Tom. \"I'm not a bit surprised, though for we've been in danger ever since we left Mobile. Anything goes here. I'd thank him to tell us some news, though.\"  \"Well, here comes some more!\" announced Jack who had shut off the power, permitting the Fortuna to ride the smooth waters of the little bight without headway.  \"Here's some more!\" cried Arnold, who has again taken the glasses. \"Left arm over head, right arm diagonally down--that's 'K.' I learned that code last fall. Here's another. Left arm up from the shoulder diagonally and right down in front--that's 'E,'and he repeats it. Then right out horizontally and left straight up from head--that's 'P.' Next, right out horizontally and left diagonally up and across the breast--that's 'O.' Now the left is out horizontally, and the right down in front--that's 'F.' He repeats it. Why, that says 'DANGER, KEEP OFF'! What does he mean?\"  \"Maybe he means what he says,\" suggested Jack. \"Answer him, Tom, and tell him we're coming ashore. Arnold and Harry, will you get the boat overboard and we'll go ashore to see what's up. Better take your automatics and see that the boat is properly equipped.\"  \"Right-o, Captain!\" cried Tom. \"I'll do my best.\"  The boat was quickly brought around and Arnold, Harry and Jack prepared to go ashore. As they pulled away from the Fortuna, Harry cautioned Tom to watch the plug in the after cabin and keep dry.  As the boat approached the shore the stranger on the beach frantically made signals indicating that he wished them to return to the Fortuna at once. Putting his fingers to his lips he glanced about as if in alarm and then put out his hand in a gesture of caution.  \"I'll bet there's some monkey business going on somewhere!\" ventured Harry. \"Why should he send up smoke signals for help and then tell us to keep away because of danger. He's kidding us!\"  \"I think I can see someone running toward us through those trees and bushes over there!\" announced Arnold standing and pointing.  A figure broke from the cover of the bushes indicated just as Arnold spoke. It was the figure of a man. He stopped a moment.  Tom from the Fortuna gave a wild cry and waved his arms.  A shot rang out and the strange boy on the beach fell forward.       CHAPTER VI  A MAROONED BOY SCOUT   Rushing ashore in the small boat, the boys paused scarcely long enough to draw their craft to a safe position on the beach before they raced to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13859"],["title","Boy Scouts in Southern Waters; Or, Spaniard's Treasure Chest (#6)"],["body","where the stranger had fallen.  They were abreast as they approached his prostrate form lying face down in the sand. With one accord they stooped to examine him. Jack rolled the body over tenderly searching for the mark of the villain's bullet but found none.  Slowly the prostrate boy opened his eyes staring about in amazement. Jack supported his head while the two chums stood by anxious to be of assistance in rendering aid to the fallen lad.  \"Where are you hurt?\" questioned Jack tenderly.  \"Nowhere!\" replied the lad. \"I heard a shot just as I tripped over something in the sand and then the next thing I knew you had me. What happened, anyway? Who shot and at what?\"  \"I don't know the fellow's name, but he was at one time a passenger on our boat, I believe. He is a villain if ever there was one!\" replied Jack with some warmth.  \"Maybe it's the same fellow I know!\" declared the stranger. \"But may I ask to whom I am indebted for the pleasure of this call?\"  Jack introduced himself, and then his two chums. In turn the stranger gave his name as Frank Evans of the Bob White patrol of St. Louis. The boys now started toward the rowboat, keeping a glance around for foes as they walked.  \"Hadn't we better get your things from on shore if you go with us?\" asked Arnold, as the boys approached the boat.  \"I haven't a thing of my own here!\" declared Frank. \"If we except, of course, my fire stick and the remains of a flounder.\"  \"A fire stick and flounder!\" cried Arnold. \"Where are they?\"  \"Up there by that old bit of wreckage,\" replied Frank. \"You see, I had nothing but my pocket knife when I landed here, and haven't had much chance to import goods since my arrival.\"  \"How long have you been here?\" queried Harry. \"We thought you must be in desperate need from the looks of the fires.\"  \"I think this is the third day,\" replied Frank. \"Yesterday I slept most of the time while the schooner was standing off and on, and the day before that was the day they put me ashore. I've had a rush with the pirates that infest these waters under the guise of honest working fishermen. They're a bad lot, too,\" he added.  \"Pirates?\" gasped the three members of the Fortuna's crew.  \"That's what I'd call them,\" replied Frank. \"You see, my chum and myself came down the Mississippi River in a gasoline launch. She was a beauty--a thirty-footer. She had a trunk cabin over three-quarters of her, and an open cockpit aft. We had her fitted up in pretty good shape, too. We wanted a little pleasure trip, so we made up our minds we'd bring the launch down here and if we got a good chance we'd sell her. My Chum, Charley Burnett, and I are the same age--seventeen last October--and we built the boat last winter. When we got through the Lake Borgne Ship Canal below New Orleans, we ran against a lot of rough fellows who tried to steal our boat. We held them at the point of a gun and ran away from their tubby old boats. Then when we got a little farther along the coast--to Bay St. Louis--we were warned to turn back.  \"Warned to turn back?\" repeated the boys in chorus. \"By whom?\"  \"A black browed chap who gave the name of Wyckoff, and who said that he wouldn't have anyone fooling around the Spanish Chest but those who rightfully should share the treasure. We didn't know what he meant, and told him so, but he wouldn't believe us.\"  \"The Spanish Treasure Chest!\" gasped Jack. \"What about it?\"  \"I don't know anything about it!\" stoutly asserted Frank.  \"We've heard a little about it,\" volunteered Jack, \"but nothing definite. We would like to know more and to know why these fellows should oppose your coming to this vicinity.\"  \"I've told you all I know about that part of the story,\" declared Frank. \"Now you know as much as I do in that line.\"  \"What did this Wyckoff look like?\" asked Harry eagerly.  \"He's black--I don't mean that he's a negro,--but he's one of these fellows with a blue-black beard that never can be shaved clean because it shows black under the skin. Then he's got a shifty eye and a sneaky look about him. Then, too,\" he added with a smile, \"he's got a smashed nose where my fist landed when he put me ashore here. I certainly handed him a beauty that time!\"  \"Good for you,\" cried Harry, clapping Frank on the shoulder.  \"What was the cause of that?\" asked Jack, \"did he hit you?\"  \"Well, to make a long story short,\" Frank continued, \"he and his gang kidnapped Charley and me from the 'Spray' two nights ago. Where they've got Charley I don't know. They put me ashore here without a thing to eat or drink and with nothing to make a fire with. As I was shoved ashore and before the boat got away, I ran up and landed on him. They were on a schooner of which Wyckoff seemed to be captain. I hope they haven't made away with Charley.\"  \"If Charley is as resourceful as you, he's all right,\" consoled Jack. \"I admire your grit and ability. How did you get a fire?\"  \"I made a fire stick as all Boy Scouts can and took a shoe lace for a bow string. I had hard work getting the first tiny blaze, but after that I've kept a bed of coals covered with sand as a reserve. I found a piece of wreckage and used part of it for a shelter. One part had a long spike in it and that I sharpened by scraping it on some of the shells. Then I got a piece of fat pine that had washed ashore and made me a torch. With this sharp spike and the torch I went fishing at night and got three dandy big flounders.\"  \"What's a flounder?\" asked Arnold intensely interested.  \"Well,\" explained Frank, \"a flounder is a queer sort of a flat fish. He's dark on top and white on the bottom. He swims on his side and has his two eyes on the one side of his head unlike any other fish. When the tide comes in he comes close inshore and burrows down into the sand to wait till a minnow floats by. He reaches up and snaps Mr. Minnow and then goes on to another good spot. If you take a bright light you can walk right up to the flounder without alarming him. Then before he knows what is coming, you thrust a spear down through his head and you have him.\"  \"Did you get yours that way?\" eagerly asked Arnold.  \"Not the first one,\" replied Frank with a laugh. \"I just scared the first one. And I'm afraid I forgot for a minute that I was a Boy Scout. I was mighty hungry and that fellow looked so nice and fat I just felt as if I simply had to have him.\"  Jack's arm stole inside Frank's and a pressure of sympathy told the Bob White that a Beaver understood his former trouble.  \"I move we go and get Frank's fire stick and bow,\" Harry suggested, \"and then put out the signal fires and hit the trail for the mainland. It is getting along in the afternoon and I'm hungry and if we make Pascagoula tonight, we'll have to go some.\"  \"Second the motion,\" declared Arnold. \"But where does Pascagoula lie from here? Where is this place, anyway?\"  \"We're on Petit Bois Island, I think,\" replied Frank. \"At least, one of the men suggested that I be put ashore on Petit Bois and the rest agreed, arguing that I would stay here only a short time before some fishermen would visit the island and find me.\"  \"Then in that case,\" Jack stated, \"Pascagoula lies just about northwest of us. If our compass hadn't been disarranged by the horseshoe, we'd have been in the harbor by this time,\" he added.  \"Your compass disarranged by a horseshoe?\" queried Frank.  \"Yes,\" was Jack's laughing rejoinder. \"Did you ever hear such a tale? And it was lucky for you it happened. There's a case of a horseshoe being lucky for you when you've never seen it yet!\"  After Jack had related the tale of the horseshoe and its relation to their present situation, Arnold suggested that they visit Frank's camp and then go aboard the Fortuna. This met the approval of all the boys. A trip to the wreckage disclosed the fact that Frank had made his bed on the hard, smooth sand with a fire in front of him for protection from the chill winds of the night.  \"Here's the fire stick,\" exultantly cried Arnold. \"Gee, won't I have a great story written about this adventure when I get back to little old Chi. Sherman Street won't know me when I arrive.\"  \"Hurray,\" cried Harry who had wandered a short distance from the others. \"Hurray, I've found the horse that belongs to the horseshoe! Here he is buried upside down in the sand.\"  Hastening to the spot indicated the boys saw what looked to be a horse's foot upside down in the sand. So startling was the resemblance that Jack and Arnold were completely deceived for a moment, but Frank's laugh soon indicated that they had been mistaken.  \"What is it?\" asked Arnold eagerly. \"Gee, but I see so many new things here I don't know which to write a story about first.\"  \"Better not write any story about this,\" admonished Frank. \"The wonderful phenomenon you see before you, my friend, is not a horse at all. It is merely a crab shell from which the crab has gone.\"  \"A crab shell?\" repeated Arnold in wonderment. \"A real crab?\"  \"Sure enough,\" declared Frank. \"The underside of the shell has exactly the same outlines as the under side of a horse's foot. This fellow has projecting from the heel a spikey tail that is hard and sharp at the end. The whole thing, as you see, is dried and hardened by exposure to the weather. The crab has been gone a long time.\"  \"I'm going to take it along,\" asserted Arnold. \"I'll put it in my locker and make a collection of things I pick up. I'd like to see a flounder now so as to recognize one the next time I see it.\"  \"I have a fine big fellow at the place I had my fires,\" Frank answered. \"We'll go over there and see how he's getting on. I got him last night. I think he must weigh as much as three or four pounds.\"  \"Tell me some more about this Spanish Treasure Chest,\" Jack said as the boys turned toward the site of Frank's camp. \"I'm anxious to know everything you overheard anywhere that would have a bearing on the matter from any viewpoint. It's interesting.\"  \"I can't tell you any more than I have. I know these fellows objected to our"]]]
