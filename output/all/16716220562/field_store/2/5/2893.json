Gradually your conception of your relations to the world will change. A new realization of power will come upon you. You will learn that you are in a new sense the master of your fate. You will find these books, like the petals of a flower, unfolding one by one until a great and vital truth stands revealed in full-blown beauty.  To derive full benefit from the _Course_ it is necessary that you should do more than merely understand each sentence as you go along. You must grasp the underlying train of thought. You must perceive the continuity of the argument.  It is necessary, therefore, that you do but a limited amount of reading each day, taking ample time to reflect on what you have read. If any book is not entirely clear to you at first, go over it again. Persistence will enable any man to acquire a thorough comprehension of our teachings and a profound mastery of our methods.     TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT     CHAPTER II  TWO LAWS OF SUCCESS-ACHIEVEMENT   [Sidenote: The One-Man Business Corporation]  As a working unit you are a kind of one-man business corporation made up of two departments, the mental and the physical.  Your mind is the executive office of this personal corporation, its directing \"head.\" Your body is the corporation's \"plant.\" Eyes and ears, sight and smell and touch, hands and feet--these are the implements, the equipment.  We have undertaken to teach you how to acquire a perfect mastery of your own powers and meet the practical problems of your life in such a way that success will be swift and certain.  [Sidenote: Business and Bodily Activity]  First of all it is necessary that you should accept and believe two well-settled and fundamental laws.  I. _All human achievement comes about through bodily activity._  II. _All bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the mind._  Give the first of these propositions but a moment's thought. You can conceive of no form of accomplishment which is not the result of some kind of bodily activity. One would say that the master works of poetry, art, philosophy, religion, are products of human effort furthest removed from the material side of life, yet even these would have perished still-born in the minds conceiving them had they not found transmission and expression through some form of bodily activity. You will agree, therefore, that the first of these propositions is so self-evident, so axiomatic, as neither to require nor to admit of formal proof.  The second proposition is not so easily disposed of. It is in fact so difficult of acceptance by some persons that we must make very plain its absolute validity. Furthermore, its elucidation will bring forth many illuminating facts that will give you an entirely new conception of the mind and its scope and influence.  [Sidenote: The Enslaved Brain]  Remember, when we say \"mind,\" we are not thinking of the brain. The brain is but one of the organs of the body, and, by the terms of our proposition as stated, is as much the slave of the mind as is any other organ of the body. To say that the mind controls the body presupposes that mind and body are distinct entities, the one belonging to a spiritual world, the other to a world of matter.  That the mind is master of the body is a settled principle of science. But we realize that its acceptance may require you to lay aside some preconceived prejudices. You may be one of those who believe that the mind is nothing more nor less than brain activity. You may believe that the body is all there is to man and that mind-action is merely one of its functions.  [Sidenote: First Step Toward Self-Realization]  If so, we want you nevertheless to realize that, while as a matter of philosophic speculation you retain these opinions, you may at the same time for practical purposes regard the mind as an independent causal agency and believe that it can and does control and determine and _cause_ any and every kind of bodily activity. We want you to do this because this conclusion is at the basis of a practical system of mental efficiency and because, as we shall at once show you, it is capable of proof by the established methods of physical science.     RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY     CHAPTER III  RELATION OF MIND ACTIVITY TO BODILY ACTIVITY  POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH YOU MUST APPROACH THIS PROBLEM   [Sidenote: Speculation and Practical Science]  The fact is, one's opinion as to whether mind controls body or body makes mind-action depends altogether upon the point of view. And the first step for us to take is to agree upon the point of view we shall assume.  Two points of view are possible. One is _speculative_, the other _practical_.  [Sidenote: Philosophic Riddles and Personal Effectiveness]  The _speculative point of view_ is that of the philosopher and religionist, who ponder the tie that binds \"soul\" and body in an effort to solve the riddle of \"creation\" and pierce the mystery of the \"hereafter.\"  The _practical point of view_ is that of the modern practical scientist, who deals only with actual facts of human experience and seeks only immediate practical results.  The speculative problem is the historical and religious one of the mortality or immortality of the soul. The practical problem is the scientific one that demands to know what the mental forces are and how they can be used most effectively.  [Sidenote: What We Want to Know]  There is no especial need here to trace the historical development of these two problems or enter upon a discussion of religious or philosophical questions.  Our immediate interest in the mind and its relationship to the body is not because we want to be assured of the salvation of our souls after death.  _We want to know all we can about the reality and certainty and character of mental control of bodily functions because of the practical use we can make of such knowledge in this life, here and now._  [Sidenote: Spiritualist, Materialist and Scientist]  The practical scientist has nothing in common with either spiritualists, soul-believers, on the one hand, or materialists on the other. So far as the mortality of the soul is concerned, he may be either a spiritualist or a materialist But spiritualism or materialism is to him only an intellectual pastime. It is not his trade. In his actual work he seeks only practical results, and so confines himself wholly to the actual facts of human experience.  The practical scientist knows that as between two given facts, and _only_ as between these two, one may be the \"cause\" of the other. But he is not interested in the \"creative origin\" of material things. He does not attempt to discover \"first\" causes.  [Sidenote: Science of Cause and Effect]  The practical scientist ascribes all sorts of qualities to electricity and lays down many laws concerning it without having the remotest idea as to what, in the last analysis, electricity may actually be. He is not concerned with ultimate truths. He does his work, and necessarily so, upon the principle that for all practical purposes he is justified in using any given assumption as a working hypothesis if everything happens just as if it were true.  The practical scientist applies the term \"cause\" to any object or event that is the invariable predecessor of some other object or event.  For him a \"cause\" is simply any object or event that may be looked upon as forecasting the action of some other object or the occurrence of some other event.  The point with him is simply this, Does or does not this object or this event in any way affect that object or that event or determine its behavior?  [Sidenote: Causes and \"First\" Causes]  No matter where you look you will find that every fact in Nature is relatively cause and effect according to the point of view. Thus, if a railroad engine backs into a train of cars it transmits a certain amount of motion to the first car. This imparted motion is again passed on to the next car, and so on. The motion of the first car is, on the one hand, the effect of the impact of the engine, and is, on the other hand, the \"cause\" of the motion of the second car. And, in general, what is an \"effect\" in the first car becomes a \"cause\" when looked at in relation to the second, and what is an \"effect\" in the second becomes a \"cause\" in relation to the third. So that even the materialist will agree that \"cause\" and \"effect\" are relative terms in dealing with any series of facts in Nature.  [Sidenote: A Common Platform for All]  A man may be either a spiritualist, believing that the mind is a manifestation of the super-soul, or he may be a materialist, and in either case he may at the same time and with perfect consistency believe, as a practical scientist, that the mind is a \"cause\" and has bodily action as its \"effect.\"  Naturally this point of view offers no difficulties whatever to the spiritualist. He already looks upon the mind or soul as the \"originating cause\" of everything.  [Sidenote: Thoughts Treated as Causes]  But the materialist, too, may in accordance with his speculative theory continue to insist that _brain-action_ is the \"originating cause\" of mental life; yet if the facts show that certain thoughts are invariably followed by certain bodily activities, the materialist may without violence to his theories agree to the great practical value of _treating these thoughts as immediate causes_, no matter what the history of creation may have been.  Whatever the brand of your materialism or your religious belief, you can join us in accepting this practical-science point of view as a common platform upon which to approach our second fundamental proposition, that \"all bodily activity is caused, controlled and directed by the mind.\"  [Sidenote: Scientific Method with Practical Problems]  Ignoring all religious and metaphysical questions, we have, then, to ask ourselves merely: _Can the mind be relied upon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13791"],["title","Psychology and Achievement (#3)"],["body"," bring about or stop or in any manner influence bodily action? And if it can, what is the extent of the mind's influence?_  In answering these questions we shall follow the method of the practical scientist, whose method is invariably the same whatever the problem he is investigating.  This method involves two steps: first, the collection and classification of facts; second, the deduction from those facts of general principles.  [Sidenote: Uses of Scientific Laws]  The scientist first gathers together the greatest possible array of experiential facts and classifies these facts into sequences--that is to say, he gathers together as many instances as he can find in which one given fact follows directly upon the happening of another given fact.  Having done this, he next formulates in broad general terms the common principle that he finds embodied in these many similar sequences.  Such a formula, if there are facts enough to establish it, is what is known as a scientific law. Its value to the world lies in this, that whenever the given fact shall again occur our knowledge of the scientific law will enable us to predict with certainty just what events will follow the occurrence of that fact.  First, then, let us marshal our facts tending to prove that bodily activities are caused by the mind.     INTROSPECTIVE EVIDENCE OF MENTAL MASTERY     CHAPTER IV  INTROSPECTIVE EVIDENCE OF MENTAL MASTERY   [Sidenote: Doing the Thing You Want to Do]  The first and most conspicuous evidential fact is voluntary bodily action; that is to say, bodily action resulting from the exercise of the conscious will.  [Sidenote: Source of Power of Will]  If you will a bodily movement and that movement immediately follows, you are certainly justified in concluding that your mind has caused the bodily movement. Every conscious, voluntary movement that you make, and you are making thousands of them every hour, is a distinct example of mind activity causing bodily action. In fact, the very will to make any bodily movement is itself nothing more nor less than a mental state.  _The will to do a thing is simply the belief, the conviction, that the appropriate bodily movement is about to occur._ The whole scientific world is agreed on this.  For example, in order to bend your forefinger do you first think it over, then deliberately put forth some special form of energy? Not at all: The very thought of bending the finger, if unhindered by conflicting ideas, is enough to bend it.  [Sidenote: Impellent Energy of Thought]  Note this general law: _The idea of any bodily action tends to produce the action._  This conception of thought as impellent--that is to say, as impelling bodily activity--is of absolutely fundamental importance. The following simple experiments will illustrate its working.  Ask a number of persons to think successively of the letters \"B,\" \"O,\" and \"Q.\" They are not to pronounce the letters, but simply to think hard about the sound of each letter.  [Sidenote: Bodily effects of Mental States]  Now, as they think of these letters, one after the other, watch closely and you will see their lips move in readiness to pronounce them. There may be some whose lip-movements you will be unable to detect. If so, it will be because your eye is not quick enough or keen enough to follow them in every case.  Have a friend blindfold you and then stand behind you with his hands on your shoulders. While in this position ask him to concentrate his mind upon some object in another part of the house. Yield yourself to the slightest pressure of his hands or arms and you will soon come to the object of which he has been thinking. If he is unfamiliar with the impelling energy of thought, he will charge the result to mind-reading.  [Sidenote: Illustrative Experiments]  The same law is illustrated by a familiar catch. Ask a friend to define the word \"spiral.\" He will find it difficult to express the meaning in words. And nine persons out of ten while groping for appropriate words will unconsciously describe a spiral in the air with the forefinger.  Swing a locket in front of you, holding the end of the chain with both hands. You will soon see that it will swing in harmony with your thoughts. If you think of a circle, it will swing around in a circle. If you think of the movement of a pendulum, the locket will swing back and forth.  These experiments not only illustrate the impelling energy of thought and its power to induce bodily action, but they indicate also that the bodily effects of mental action are not limited to bodily movements that are conscious and voluntary.  [Sidenote: Scope of Mind Power]  _The fact is, every mental state whether you consider it as involving an act of the will or not, is followed some kind of bodily effect, and every bodily action is preceded by some distinct kind of mental activity. From the practical science point of view every thought causes its particular bodily effects._  This is true of simple sensations. It is true of impulses, ideas and emotions. It is true of pleasures and pains. It is true of conscious mental activity. It is true of unconscious mental activity. It is true of the whole range of mental life.  Since the mental conditions that produce bodily effects are not limited to those mental conditions in which there is a conscious exercise of the will, it follows that _the bodily effects produced by mental action are not limited to movements of what are known as the voluntary muscles._  On the contrary, they include changes and movements in all of the so-called involuntary muscles, and in every kind of bodily structure. They include changes and movements in every part of the physical organism, from changes in the action of heart, lungs, stomach, liver and other viscera, to changes in the secretions of glands and in the caliber of the tiniest blood-vessels. A few instances such as are familiar to the introspective experience of everyone will illustrate the scope of the mind's control over the body.  [Sidenote: Bodily Effects of Emotion]  Emotion always causes numerous and intense bodily effects. Furious anger may cause frowning brows, grinding teeth, contracted jaws, clenched fists, panting breath, growling cries, bright redness of the face or sudden paleness. None of these effects is voluntary; we may not even be conscious of them.  Fright may produce a wild beating of the heart, a death-like pallor, a gasping motion of the lips, an uncovering or protruding of the eye-balls, a sudden rigidity of the body as if \"rooted\" to the spot.  Grief may cause profuse secretion of tears, swollen, reddened face, red eyes and other familiar symptoms.  Shame may cause that sudden dilation of the capillary blood-vessels of the face known as \"blushing.\"  [Sidenote: Bodily Effects of Perception]  The sight of others laughing or yawning makes us laugh or yawn. The sound of one man coughing will become epidemic in an audience. The thought of a sizzling porter-house steak with mushrooms, baked potatoes and rich _gravy_ makes the mouth of a hungry man \"water.\"  Suppose I show you a lemon cut in half and tell you with a wry face and puckered mouth that I am going to suck the juice of this exceedingly sour lemon. As you merely read these lines you may observe that the glands in your mouth have begun to secrete saliva. There is a story of a man who wagered with a friend that he could stop a band that was playing in front of his office. He got three lemons and gave half of a lemon to each of a number of street urchins. He then had these boys walk round and round the band, sucking the lemons and making puckered faces at the musicians. That soon ended the music.  [Sidenote: Experiments of Pavlov]  A distinguished German scientist, named Pavlov, has recently demonstrated in a series of experiments with dogs that the sight of the plate that ordinarily bears their food, or the sight of the chair upon which the plate ordinarily stands, or even the sight of the person who commonly brings the plate, may cause the saliva to flow from their salivary glands just as effectively as the food itself would do if placed in their mouths.  [Sidenote: Taste and digestion]  There was a time, and that not long ago, when the contact of food with the lining of the stomach was supposed to be the immediate cause of the secretion of the digestive fluids. Yet recent observation of the interior of the stomach through an incision in the body, has shown that just as soon as the food is _tasted_ in the mouth, a purely mental process, the stomach begins to well forth those fluids that are suitable for digestion.  [Sidenote: Bodily Effects of Sensations]  The press recently contained an account of a motorcycle race in Newark, New Jersey. The scene was a great bowl-shaped motor-drome. In the midst of cheering thousands, when riding at the blinding speed of ninety-two miles an hour, the motorcycle of one of the contestants went wrong. It climbed the twenty-eight-foot incline, hurled its rider to instant death and crashed into the packed grandstand. Before the whirling mass of steel was halted by a deep-set iron pillar four men lay dead and twenty-two others unconscious and severely injured. Then the twisted engine of death rebounded from the post and rolled down the saucer-rim of the track.  Around the circular path, his speed scarcely less than that of his ill-fated rival, knowing nothing of the tragedy, hearing nothing of the screams of warning from the crowd, came another racer. The frightened throng saw the coming of a second tragedy. The sound that came from the crowd was a low moaning, a sighing, impotent, unconscious prayer of the thousands for the mercy that could not come. The second motorcycle struck the wreck, leaped into the air, and the body of its rider shot fifty feet over the handlebars and fell at the bottom of the track unconscious. Two hours later he was dead.  What was the effect of this dreadful spectacle upon the onlookers? Confusion, cries of fright and "]]]
