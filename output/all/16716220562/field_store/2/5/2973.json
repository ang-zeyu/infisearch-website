[Sidenote: Constructive Captors.]  He says       \"the Act of Parliament (meaning the Prize Act), and the      proclamation, give the benefit of prize to the takers, by      which term, are naturally to be understood those who      _actually take possession_, or those affording an actual      contribution of endeavour to that event; either of these      persons are naturally included under the name of takers, but      the Courts of Law have gone further, and have extended the      term 'takers' to those who, not having contributed actual      service, are supposed to have rendered a constructive      assistance, either by conveying encouragement to the captor,      or intimidation to the enemy. * * * It has been contended      that where ships are associated in a _common enterprize_,      that circumstance is sufficient to entitle them to share      equally and alike in the prizes that are made; but many      cases might be stated when ships so associated would _not_      share. I must ever hold that the principle of mere common      enterprise is not sufficient--it is not sufficiently      specific--it must be more limited. What is the real and true      criterion? She being in sight, or seeing the enemy's fleet      accidentally, a day or two before, will not be sufficient;      it must be at the commencement of the engagement, either in      the act of chasing, or in preparations for chase, or      afterwards during its continuance. If a ship was detached in      sight of the enemy, and under preparation for chase, I      should have no hesitation in saying that she ought to share;      but if she was sent away after the enemy had been descried,      but before any preparations for chase, or any hostile      movements had taken place, I think it would be otherwise;      there must be _some actual contribution of endeavour as well      as a general intention_.\"[93]  [Sidenote: Efforts to suppress Privateering.]  Powerful efforts have been made by humane and enlightened individuals to suppress Privateering, as inconsistent with the liberal spirit of the age. In the language of Chancellor Kent,       \"the object is not honour, or chivalric fame, but plunder      and profit. The discipline of the crews is not apt to be of      the highest order, and privateers are often guilty of      enormous excesses, and become the scourge of neutral      commerce.\"  They are sometimes manned and officered by foreigners, having no permanent connection with the country, or interest in the cause. This was a complaint made by the United States in 1819, in relation to irregularities and atrocities committed by private armed vessels, sailing under the flag of Buenos Ayres. Under the best regulations the business tends strongly to blunt the sense of private right, and to nourish a lawless and fierce spirit of rapacity.  Its abolition has generally been attempted by treaty. In the treaty of Prussia and the United States, in 1785, stipulations against private armed vessels were included. In 1675, a similar agreement was made between Sweden and Holland, but the agreement was not performed. France, soon after the breaking out of the war with Austria, in 1792, passed a decree for the total suppression of privateering, but that was a transitory act, and was soon swept away in the tempest of the Revolution.  [Sidenote: Piratical Privateering.]  On these considerations naturally follows that of the classes of Privateers that can be considered Pirates.  A Privateer differs from a Pirate, in that--first, the former is provided with a Commission, or with Letters of Marque from a Sovran, of which the Pirate is destitute. Secondly, the Privateer supposes a state of war (or at least that of reprisals); the Pirate plunders in the midst of peace, as well as in war. Thirdly, the Privateer is obliged to observe the rules and instructions that have been given him, and to attack by virtue of them only the enemy's ships, or those neutral vessels which carry on an illicit commerce; the Pirate plunders indiscriminately the ships of all nations, without observing even the laws of war. But in this last point Privateers may become Pirates when they transgress the limits prescribed to them; and this is one of the reasons why we often see the former confounded with the latter.[94]  Under these general definitions, we see that it is quite open to any citizen of the world to become a privateer under a foreign Sovran; and Martens goes on to say, that       \"there is nothing that prevents the granting of Letters of      Marque, even to the subjects of neutral or allied powers who      are able to solicit them; but since it is contrary to      neutrality to suffer subjects to contribute by this means to      the reinforcement of one of the belligerent powers, and to      the annoyance of the other, states generally prohibit their      subjects from taking Letters of Marque from a power, without      the permission of their Sovereigns, and many treaties oblige      them also to prohibit their subjects from doing it, as well      as to forbid every species of armaments on the enemy's      account, in their ports. However, the enemy is not justified      in _punishing them as pirates_, when they have letters      patent from one of the powers with whom it is at war,      although their ship may be confiscated.\"[95]  The laws of the United States have made ample provision on this subject, and they may be considered as an expression of the general wish of civilized nations; and they prescribed specific punishment for acts which were before unlawful.  American citizens are prohibited from being concerned, beyond the limits of the United States, in fitting out or otherwise assisting any private vessel of war, to cruize against the subjects of friendly powers.[96]  In the various treaties between the powers of Europe, in the two last centuries, and in the several treaties between the United States and France, Holland, Sweden, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, Colombia, Chili, &c., it is declared, that no subject or citizen of either nation shall accept a commission or letter of marque, to assist an enemy in hostilities against the other, under penalty of being treated as an enemy.[97]  The Title to Property taken in War may, upon general Title to principles, be considered as immediately divested from the original owner, and transferred to the captor. As to personal property, the title is considered as lost to the former proprietor, as soon as the enemy has acquired a firm possession, which, as a general rule, is considered as taking place after the lapse of twenty-four hours.[98]  Ships and goods captured _at sea_, are excepted from the operation of this rule. The right to all captures rests primarily in the Sovran, and no individual can have any interest in a prize, whether made by a crown or private armed vessel, but what he receives under the grant of the state.  When a prize is taken at sea, it must be brought with due care into some port, for adjudication by a competent court. The condemnation must be pronounced by a prize court of the Government of the captor, sitting either in the country of the captor, or of his ally. The prize court of an ally cannot condemn.[99]  [Sidenote: Proceedings Preliminary to Condemnation.]  The Proceedings Preliminary to Condemnation may be roughly described as follows:--  The _captor_, immediately on bringing his prize into port, sends up and delivers upon oath to the registry of the Court of Admiralty, all papers found on board the prize. The preparatory examinations of the captain and some of the crew of the _captured ship_ are then taken, upon a set of standing interrogatories, before the commissioners of the port to which the prize is brought. These also are forwarded to the registry of the Court of Admiralty. A written _notice_, called a _monition_, is extracted by the captor from the registry, and served upon the Royal Exchange, notifying the capture, and calling upon all persons interested, to appear and show cause why the ship and goods should not be condemned. At the expiration of twenty days, the monition is returned into the registry, with a certificate of its service; and if any claim has been given, the cause is then ready for hearing, upon evidence arising out of the ship's papers and preparatory examinations.  The _neutral master or proprietor of the cargo_ takes measures as follows:--Upon being brought into port, the master usually makes a protest, which he forwards to London as instructions, (or with such further directions as he thinks proper) either to the correspondent of his owners, or to the consul of his nation, in order to claim the ship or such parts of the cargo as belong to his owners, or with which he was particularly entrusted; or the master himself goes to London to take the necessary steps, as soon as he has undergone his examination.  The master, correspondent, or consul, applies to a proctor, who prepares a claim supported by the affidavit of the claimant, stating briefly to whom, as he believes, the ship and goods claimed belong; and that no enemy has any right or interest therein; security must be given to the amount of sixty pounds, to answer costs, if the case should appear so grossly fraudulent on the part of the claimant as to subject him to be condemned therein. If the captor has neglected in the mean time to take the usual steps, (but which seldom happens, as he is strictly enjoined both by his instructions and by the Prize Act to proceed immediately to adjudication,) a process issues against him, on the application of the claimant's proctor, to bring in the ship's papers and preparatory examinations, and to proceed in the usual way.  As soon as the claim is given, copies of the ship's papers and examinations are procured from the registry, and upon "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13859"],["title","Boy Scouts in Southern Waters; Or, Spaniard's Treasure Chest (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders    BOY SCOUTS IN SOUTHERN WATERS  Or, Spaniard's Treasure Chest  by  G.

W 117, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS       BOY SCOUTS IN SOUTHERN WATERS OR THE SPANIARD'S TREASURE CHEST     CHAPTER I  A COLLISION IN THE FOG   \"Wow! Look at that one! That's a monster!\"  \"That must be the ninth wave.\"  \"What do you mean by the ninth wave, Jack?\"  \"Why, Arnold, don't you know that every third wave is bigger than the two preceding it and that every ninth wave is bigger than the preceding eight?\" queried Jack Stanley.  \"No, can't say that I ever knew that,\" replied Arnold Poysor leaning out of the pilot house of a sturdy motor boat plowing her way through the waters of that part of the Gulf of Mexico known as Mississippi Sound. \"But I do know,\" he continued, \"that if the Fortuna takes many more green ones over her bow, we'll have to get something other than oilskins to keep us dry!\"  \"Gee, I wish this fog would lift and let us find out where we are!\" put in a third member of the part. \"This is fierce!\"  \"It's thicker than the mush we used to get in that South Water Street restaurant when we were fitting out in Chicago!\" declared the first speaker. \"That was a bum place to eat!\"  \"Never mind the eats!\" replied the one addressed as \"Jack.\" \"Just you keep that Klaxon going. You know we're on government waters here and the pilot rules require us to keep a fog signal sounding once every minute. We had hard enough work to convince the United States Inspectors that the Klaxon would make a perfectly good fog signal. Let's not fall down now on the job of keeping it going.\"  \"I'd hate like everything to have a collision!\"  \"So would we all!\" declared the first speaker.  Four boys were standing in the pilot house of a sturdily built and splendidly equipped motor boat that was being rolled and tossed by the, waves driven from the Gulf of Mexico before a southerly wind. Great banks of fog were rolling inland before the wind--fog so thick it was scarcely possible to see a boat's length ahead.  The boys were all dressed in suits of oil skins under which might have been seen neat khaki Boy Scout Uniforms. If their jackets had been exposed one might have distinguished medals that betokened membership in the Beaver Patrol, Boy Scouts of America. Other insignia indicated to the initiated that the boys had won distinction and were entitled to the honors in Seamanship, Life Saving, Stalking and Signaling. On the jacket of the one addressed as \"Jack\" were insignia that betokened his rank as Scout Master and also as Star Scout. These had been won by sheer merit.  All four were manly young fellows of about seventeen and, though young, their faces gave evidence of alert natures thoroughly reliable and ready for any emergency.  Their vessel, the Fortuna, appeared fully equal to any task that might be expected of her. Trimly built and graceful, yet solidly and staunchly constructed, she rode the waves like a thing of life. Her engines, which by common consent had been reduced to half speed in deference to the law, worked perfectly, driving the powerful hull through the water easily. Just now she met the oncoming waves, driving into them with a good deal of spray about the bows.  Jack Stanley, Scout Master of the Beaver Patrol of Chicago, Boy Scouts of America, was Captain of the Fortuna. His father was president of a bank in Chicago and had requested Jack and his chums to take the Fortuna from Chicago to Southern waters where they would later on be joined by the banker for a cruise among the islands and points of interest in that vicinity. Jack was a fine, manly lad who well deserved the honors bestowed upon him. His companions were equally clean and worthy young boys who were members of the Beaver Patrol and who all were devoted to Jack.  Harry Harvey, an orphan, worked as messenger for one of the large telegraph companies. He had seen a great deal of life and was far older than his years. Tom Blackwood worked as an inspector in one of the great department stores of State Street while Arnold Poysor was an apprentice in a printing establishment and was possessed of an ambition to become a great journalist.  Without doubt it would have been difficult to find four more congenial lads than the crew of the Fortuna. Widely different in their appearance they still gave one the impression that they all belonged to each other. There was the same fearless, honest look in their sparkling eyes, the same erectness of carriage, the same confident walk that bespoke clean, ambitious, well-trained lives.  Just now they were all anxiously gathered in the pilot house eagerly on the lookout for any possible danger that might be threatening them from out the dense fog being swept inland by the wind. Harry was at the wheel while Jack stood with his hand close to the switchboard that governed the engines pulsating below. Tom and Arnold were leaning half way out of the open windows heedless of the fog and the spray that now and again fell in sheets over the pilot house as the Fortuna thrust her nose into a large wave.  \"Great fishes!\" ejaculated Tom. \"I'd like to have a collision with some eats right soon. I'm nearly starved and drowned and several other things! I haven't eaten since we left Mobile!\"  \"Score one for Tom!\" cried Harry. \"He washes the dishes next time! Remember our bargain, old Scout,\" he continued. \"Do you remember what we agreed to do when we left Chicago?\"  \"Could I forget it with your melodious Klaxon working overtime?\" queried Tom. \"Great Fishes isn't slang, though! Ask Jack.\"  \"How about it, Jack?\" asked Harry. \"Does he wash or not wash, that's the question. Fair play here--let the umpire decide!\"  Before he spoke, Jack pressed the button that actuated the Klaxon. When the raucous noise of the fog horn had died away he turned to the two disputants with a quizzical look and said:  \"You'd be more careful of your language if your mother were here, wouldn't you, Tom?\" and then, as a look of triumph on the face of exultant Harry was about to be followed by a shout of rejoicing, he continued. \"And I'm sure that when Harry makes a mistake we'll all be as considerate of his feelings as we are able. But Tom washes the dishes as a penalty for using slang!\" he announced in a tone of pleasant finality that was unmistakable.  \"Who's going to be cook this next watch?\" asked Arnold.  \"It's my work, by the schedule,\" replied Jack, \"but if you lads will excuse me now, I'll do double duty later on. I hate to leave the deck even for a few minutes. I don't feel at all easy!\"  \"Why, what can make you uneasy?\" put in Harry.  \"I don't know,\" Jack answered. \"I suppose it's only a notion due to indigestion after eating some of Tom's cookery, but I have a sort of uneasy feeling that something is going to happen and I want to be on deck when it comes. That's all!\"  \"Well, I'm about starved and so if this portentous calamity will please postpone its arrival until I get my lunch, I'll be much obliged!\" remarked Arnold. \"I'll go get dinner. I follow Jack on the cooking schedule. What'll it be, gentlemen?\"  \"More of that fine Red Snapper!\" quickly answered Harry.  \"If you boys can wait long enough, I'd like some of those famous biscuits Arnold knows so well how to make,\" added Tom.  \"And I,\" said Jack, \"would like a double portion of both of those and a cup of that excellent coffee we bought at Mobile.\"  \"Wee, Mong Sewers! Zee Chef departs!\" announced Arnold disappearing down the stairs leading to the cabin from whence in a short time the aroma of delicious coffee was wafted up to the three boys in the pilot house, each striving to peer farther into the fog which seemed to be getting thicker each passing moment.  \"Seems to me I hear the booming of the surf on a jagged and rock bound coast,\""]]]
