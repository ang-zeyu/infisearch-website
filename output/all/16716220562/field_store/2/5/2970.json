The subjects of one country are all, and every one of them, the foes of every subject of the other, and from this principle flow many important consequences.[8]  [Sidenote: Property of Subjects of Belligerent States in the Enemy's Country.]  On the commencement of hostilities a natural expectation will arise that the Property, (if not the Persons) of the Belligerent State, found in the Enemy's Territory, will become liable to seizure and confiscation, especially as no declaration or notice of war is now necessary to legalize hostilities. According to strict authority, the Persons and Property of Subjects of the Enemy found in the belligerent state are liable to detention and confiscation; but even on this point diversity of opinion has arisen among institutional writers; and modern usage seems to exempt the Persons and Property of the Enemy found in either territory at the outbreak of the war, from its operations.  Without entering on the long arguments that have been produced on this subject, and which it is not the intention of this treatise to reproduce, the rule may be stated very nearly as follows.[9]  That though, on principle, the property of the enemy is liable to seizure and confiscation, yet it is now an established international usage that such property found within the territory of the belligerent state, or debts due to its subjects by the government or individuals, _at the commencement_ of hostilities, are not liable to be seized and confiscated as prize of war.  This rule is often enforced by treaty, but unless thus enforced it cannot be considered as an inflexible, though established, rule. This rule is a guide which the Sovran of the belligerent state follows or abandons at will, and although it cannot be disregarded by him without obloquy, yet it may be disregarded. It is not an immutable rule, but depends on considerations which continually vary.[10]  [Sidenote: Rule with respect to Immoveable Property.]  The rule is different with respect to Immoveable Things, such as Landed Estates. He who declares war does not confiscate the Immoveable Estate possessed in his country by the enemy, but the Income may be sequestrated, to prevent its being remitted to the enemy.[11]  [Sidenote: Public Funds.]  Public Funds, or in other words, debts due from the Sovran of the hostile state to Private Persons, are always held protected from confiscation, and there is only one instance in modern times where this rule has been broken. It is a matter of public faith; and even during war, no enquiry ought to be made whether any part of the public debt is due to the subjects of the enemy.[12]  [Sidenote: Rule of Reciprocity.]  All these rules are, however, subject to the Rule of Reciprocity. This is thus laid down by Sir William Scott, in the case of the Santa Cruz,       \"that at the commencement of a war, it is the constant      practice of this country to condemn property seized before      the war, if the enemy condemns, and to restore if the enemy      restores. It is a principle sanctioned by that great      foundation of the Law of England, _Magna Charta_ itself,      which prescribes, that at the commencement of a war the      enemy's merchants shall be kept and treated as our own      merchants are treated in their country.\"[13]  [Sidenote: Droits of Admiralty.]  [14]In England, at present, however, these liberal principles are modified by Rights of Admiralty, the foregoing rules being applied rather to property _upon the land_ than _within the territory_; for although, when captures are made in ports, havens, or rivers, within the body of the country of the realm, the Admiralty is in reality excluded, yet Prize Courts have uniformly, without objection, tried all such captures in ports and havens within the realm; as in the case of ships not knowing hostilities, coming in by mistake, before the declaration of war or hostilities; all the ships of the enemy are detained in our ports, to be confiscated as the property of the enemy, if no reciprocal agreement is made.[15]  [Sidenote: Hostile Embargo.]  This species of reprisal is termed a Hostile Embargo. It cannot well be distinguished from the practice of seizing property found within the territory upon the declaration of war. It is undoubtedly against the spirit of modern liberality, and has been but too justly reprobated as destroying that protection to property which the rule of faith and justice gives it, when brought into the country in the course of trade, and in the confidence of peace.  It is not, however, as Wheaton states, peculiar to England, but common to modern Europe, except that England does not, in practice, appear to be influenced by the corresponding conduct of the enemy in that respect.[16]  [Sidenote: Debts Due to and from an Enemy.]  But with relation to Debts Due to an Enemy, previous to hostilities, English law follows a wiser principle.  On the outbreak of war between Denmark and this country in 1807, the Danish Government, as a measure of retaliation for the seizure of their ships in our ports, issued an ordinance sequestrating all debts due from Danish to British subjects, causing them to be paid into the Danish Royal Treasury.  The Court of King's Bench decided that this was not a legal defence to a suit in England for the debt, and that the ordinance was not conformable to the Law to Nations.[17] It was observed by the Court, that the right of confiscating debts (contended for on the authority of Vattel,)[18] was not recognised by Grotius,[19] and was impugned by Puffendorf and others; and that no instance had occurred of the exercise of the right, (except the ordinance in question,) for upwards of a century. This is undoubtedly the law in England, although it may be doubted if this rule still holds so strongly in the United States.  [Sidenote: Interruption of Intercourse; Trading with the Enemy unlawful.]  One of the most immediate consequences of the outbreak of hostilities is the complete interruption of Commercial Intercourse between the subjects of the countries at war, even to the extent of holding it unlawful, after war has begun, except under special licence of the government, to send a vessel to the enemy's country to bring home, with _their permission_, one's own property, when war has broken out.  There cannot exist at the same time a war for arms and a peace for commerce; from the very nature of war all commercial intercourse ceases between enemies. This interdiction of intercourse is the result of the mere operation of war; for declarations of war generally enjoin on every subject the duty of attack on the subjects of the hostile state, of seizing their goods, and doing them every harm in their power.[20]  From the very nature of war itself, all commercial intercourse ceases between enemies. The utility, however, of merchants, and the mutual wants of nations, have almost got the better of the law of war as to commerce. Hence, commerce is alternately permitted and forbidden in time of war, as princes think it most for the interest of their subjects. A commercial nation is anxious to trade, and accommodate the laws of war to the greater or lesser want that it may have for the goods of the other. Thus sometimes a mutual commerce is permitted generally; sometimes as to certain merchandizes only, while others are prohibited; and sometimes it is prohibited altogether. In this manner there is partly peace and partly war, between subjects of both countries.[21]  In the case of the Hoop,[22] Sir Wm. Scott says,       \"By the law and constitution of Great Britain, the Sovereign      alone has the power of declaring War and Peace. He alone,      therefore, who has the power of entirely removing the state      of war, has the power of removing it in part, by permitting,      when he sees proper, that commercial intercourse, which is a      partial suspension of the war. There may be occasions on      which such an intercourse may be highly expedient; but it is      not for individuals to determine on the expediency of such      occasions, on their own notions of commerce only, and      possibly on grounds of private advantage not very      reconcilable with the general interests of the state. It is      for the state alone, on more enlarged views of policy, and      of all circumstances that may be connected with such an      intercourse, to determine when it shall be permitted, and      under what regulations. No principle ought to be held more      sacred than that this intercourse cannot subsist on any      other footing than that of the direct permission of the      state. Who can be insensible to the consequences that might      follow, if every person in time of war had a right to carry      on a commercial intercourse with the enemy; and under colour      of that, had the means of carrying on any other species of      intercourse he might think fit? The inconvenience to the      public might be extreme; and where is the inconvenience on      the other side, that the merchants should be compelled, in      such a situation of the two countries, to carry on his trade      between them, (if necessary,) under the eye and control of      the Government charged with the care of public safety?\"  [Sidenote: Alien Enemy cannot sue in this country.]  Sir William then goes on to say,       \"another principle of law, of a less politic nature, but      equally general in its reception and direct in its      application, forbids this sort of communication as      fundamentally inconsistent with the relation at the time      existing between the two countries, and that is the total      inability to sustain any contract by an appeal to the      tribunals of the one country, on the part of the subjects of      the other. In the law of almost every country, the character      of an Alien Enemy carries with it a disability to sue, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],["title","The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#3)"],["body","      sustain, in the language of the civilians, a _persona standi      in judicio_. The peculiar law of our own country applies      this principle with great rigour--the same principle is      received in our Courts of the Law of nations; they are so      far _British_ courts, that no man can sue therein who is a      subject of the Enemy, unless under particular circumstances      that _pro hac vice_ discharge him from the character of an      Enemy, such as his coming under a flag of truce, a cartel,      or a pass, or some other act of public authority that puts      him in the Queen's peace _pro hac vice_. But otherwise he is      totally _Ex lex_! Even in the case of ransom bills which      were contracts, but contracts arising out of _the laws of      war_, and tolerated as such, the Enemy was not permitted to      sue _in his own person_, for the payment of the ransom bill;      the payment was enforced by an action brought by the      imprisoned hostage in the courts of his own country, for the      recovery of his freedom. A state in which contracts cannot      be enforced is not a state of legal commerce.\"  [Sidenote: No Trade permitted except under Royal licence.]       \"Upon these and similar grounds, it has been the established      rule of this court, confirmed by the judgment of the supreme      court, that a trading with the enemy, except under a Royal      Licence, subjects the property to confiscation.       \"Where the Government has authorised, under sanction of an      Act of Parliament, a _homeward trade_ from the enemy's      possessions, but has not specifically protected an _outward_      _trade_ to the same, though intimately connected with that      homeward trade, and almost necessary to its existence, the      rule has been enforced, where strong claim not merely of      convenience, but almost of necessity, excused it on behalf      of the individual.       \"It has been enforced, where cargoes have been laden before      the war, but where the parties have not used all possible      diligence to countermand the voyage after the first notice      of hostilities.[23]       \"In the last war between England and America, a case      occurred in which an American citizen had purchased a      quantity of goods within the British territory, a long time      previous to the war, and had deposited them upon an island      near the frontier; upon the breaking out of hostilities, his      agents had hired a vessel to proceed to the spot, to bring      away the goods; on her return she was captured, and with the      cargo, condemned as prize of war.\"[24]  So also, where goods were purchased, some time before the war, by the agent of an American citizen in Great Britain, but not shipped until nearly a year after the declaration of hostilities, they were pronounced liable to confiscation.[25]  Where property is to be withdrawn from the country of the enemy, it is the more satisfactory and guarded proceeding on the part of the _British_ merchant to apply to his own Government for the special importation of the article; it is indeed the only safe way in which parties can proceed.[26]  [Sidenote: Subjects of an Ally may not trade with the Enemy.]  During a Conjoint War no Subject of an Ally can trade with the common enemy without liability to forfeiture in the prize courts of the Ally, of all his property engaged in such trade. As the former rule can be relaxed only by permission of the Sovran power of the state, so this can be relaxed only by the permission of the allied nations, according to their mutual consent.[27]  [Sidenote: Contracts void.]  On similar principles, all Contracts made with the Enemy _during War_ are utterly _void_. This applies to Insurances on the enemy's property and trade; to the drawing and negociation of Bills of Exchange, whether the subject of this country or of the alien enemy be the acceptor; to the sending of Money or Bills to the enemy's country; to Commercial Partnerships. All endeavours to trade by third persons are equally illegal.[28]  Thus also all Contracts made in contemplation of War, and which never could have existed at all, but as an insurance against the pressure of war, and with a view to evade the rights that arise out of war, and in fraud of the belligerent, are illegal, even though made by neutrals.[29]  [Sidenote: Insurances.]  The municipal or common law of every state declares all Insurances to be void, by which ships or merchandize of the enemy are sought to be protected. Also all Insurances by or on behalf of _alien_ enemies are wholly illegal and void, although effected before the breaking out of hostilities; but if both the policy had been effected and the loss accrued before the war, the remedy is only suspended during the war.  The general principle is that the contract of assurance is vacated and annulled _ab initio_; wherever an insurance is made on a voyage expressly prohibited by the common, statute, or maritime law of the country; the policy is of no effect.[30]  Thus, if a ship, though neutral, be insured on a voyage prohibited by an embargo laid on in time of war, by the prince of the country in whose ports the ships happen to be, such an insurance is void.[31]  Similarly, all Insurances to protect the interests of British subjects trading without licence with the enemy are absolutely void.[32]  So also, if a Licence is not strictly pursued, so that the voyage becomes illegal, the insurance is void.[33]  I have said that all Insurances will be void which are designed to protect voyages or trading to hostile ports. But, for this purpose, it must be clearly made out, not only that the port into which the ship sails is hostile, but also, that she was bound with a distinct hostile destination at the time of loss. Thus a policy to \"ports in the Baltic,\" is legal, as some may be hostile, and some not, and it is not certain that she was sailing to a hostile port.  The general principle by which the validity of a policy is to be tested, is by the voyage, that it is a voyage prohibited by law, on some ground of public policy. The will, therefore, of the parties is of no account, as the prohibition is for public, and not private benefit. So that if the underwriter is told that the voyage is illicit he is not more bound than if he were not told so.[34]  It is Insurances upon voyages generally prohibited by law, such as to an enemy's garrison, or upon a voyage directly contrary to an express act of parliament, or to royal proclamation in time of War, that are absolutely void and null;--therefore, on neutral vessels, or the vessels of British subjects possessing neutral rights and sailing from neutral ports to enemies ports are not void.[35]  Similarly, with respect to Insurances on neutral vessels carrying _contraband goods_, for it is not the voyage, but the cargo, that is illegal in that case.[36]  Insurances are good on Neutral Vessels engaged in the Colonial Trade of the Enemy, and which was closed to the Neutral in time of peace,[37] It must be observed, that if a voyage is illegal, and voids the policy for that voyage, it does not follow that it voids the voyage in the opposite direction, and even the goods purchased by the proceeds of a former illegal voyage, may be the subject of Insurance.[38]  [Sidenote: Bills of Exchange drawn during War.]  It has been stated above that all Bills drawn or negociated with the enemy, whether a British subject or the alien enemy be the acceptor, are null and void; during the last war, however, attempts were often made to draw and negociate bills that should pass muster in our courts of law, as for example:--  An alien enemy, during war, drew upon a British subject resident in England, and who had funds of the alien in his hands; the drawer then indorsed the bill to an English-born subject, resident in the hostile country; such a bill cannot be enforced even after the restoration of peace, for otherwise it would enable alien enemies to take the benefit of all their property in this country, by allowing them to pay debts out of such funds, by the instrumentality of bills.[39]  The principle seems to be,--that it is not every bill that bears the name of an alien enemy upon it that is void, but such bills only that are instrumental in assisting in communication with an alien enemy;--and a liberal application of this principle has been made use of to open a way for English prisoners to make use of their property at home for their support in the country of their captivity. Thus, where one of two Englishmen, detained in France on the breaking out of hostilities, drew in favour of the other, upon a subject here, it was held that he might legally draw such a bill for his _subsistence_, and that he might indorse it to an alien enemy, an inhabitant of the hostile country; for he could not avail himself of the bill except by negociation; and to whom could he negociate it, except to the inhabitants of the country in which he resided?[40]  Bills, like other contracts, are only void by the policy of war; but the law still recognizes some extent of obligation between the parties, so that bills void in their concoction (as instruments of trade with the enemy,) are not so far void that they may not constitute the basis of a promise by which a party may bind himself on the return of peace.[41]  [Sidenote: Contracts made before the War.]  On the very important question of the effect of a declaration on Contracts with the subjects or the enemy, _entered into previous to the War_, the rule is, that if the performance of the contract be rendered unlawful by the Government of the country, the contract is dissolved on both sides.[42]  Thus the contract of Affreightment is dissolved when the voyage becomes unlawful, by the commencement of war, or the interdiction of commerce;[43] and this whether the interdiction is complete as to the ship, or partial as to the receiving of goods.  Similarly, if the voyage be broken up by"]]]
