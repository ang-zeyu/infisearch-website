The women     were not impregnable; but the terms and manner of compliance were     as decent as those in marriage among us, and according to their     notions, the agreement was as innocent. When any of our people     made an overture to any of their young women, he was given to     understand that the consent of her friends was necessary, and by     the influence of a proper present it was generally obtained; but     when these preliminaries were settled, it was also necessary to     treat the wife for a night with the same delicacy that is here     required by the wife for life, and the lover who presumed to take     any liberties by which this was violated, was sure to be     disappointed.\" (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 254.)      Cook found that the people of New Zealand \"bring the prepuce over     the gland, and to prevent it from being drawn back by contraction     of the part, they tie the string which hangs from the girdle     round the end of it. The glans, indeed, seemed to be the only     part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal, for     they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and     string, with the most careless indifference, but showed manifest     signs of confusion when, to gratify our curiosity, they were     requested to untie the string, and never consented but with the     utmost reluctance and shame.... The women's lower garment was     always bound fast round them, except when they went into the     water to catch lobsters, and then they took great care not to be     seen by the men. We surprised several of them at this employment,     and the chaste Diana, with her nymphs, could not have discovered     more confusion and distress at the sight of Actæon, than these     women expressed upon our approach. Some of them hid themselves     among the rocks, and the rest crouched down in the sea till they     had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they     could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could     see that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence.\"     (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 257-258.)      In Rotuma, in Polynesia, where the women enjoy much freedom, but     where, at all events in old days, married people were, as a rule,     faithful to each other, \"the language is not chaste according to     our ideas, and there is a great deal of freedom in speaking of     immoral vices. In this connection a man and his wife will speak     freely to one another before their friends. I am informed,     though, by European traders well conversant with the language,     that there are grades of language, and that certain coarse     phrases would never be used to any decent woman; so that     probably, in their way, they have much modesty, only we cannot     appreciate it.\" (J. Stanley Gardiner, \"The Natives of Rotuma,\"     _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, May, 1898, p. 481.)      The men of Rotuma, says the same writer, are very clean, the     women also, bathing twice a day in the sea; but \"bathing in     public without the _kukuluga_, or _sulu_ [loin-cloth, which is     the ordinary dress], around the waist is absolutely unheard of,     and would be much looked down upon.\" (_Journal of the     Anthropological Institute_, 1898, p. 410.)      In ancient Samoa the only necessary garment for either man or     woman was an apron of leaves, but they possessed so \"delicate a     sense of propriety\" that even \"while bathing they have a girdle     of leaves or some other covering around the waist.\" (Turner,     _Samoa a Hundred Years Ago_, p. 121.)      After babyhood the Indians of Guiana are never seen naked. When     they change their single garment they retire. The women wear a     little apron, now generally made of European beads, but the     Warraus still make it of the inner bark of a tree, and some of     seeds. (Everard im Thurn, _Among the Indians of Guiana_, 1883.)      The Mandurucu women of Brazil, according to Tocantins (quoted by     Mantegazza), are completely naked, but they are careful to avoid     any postures which might be considered indecorous, and they do     this so skilfully that it is impossible to tell when they have     their menstrual periods. (Mantegazza, _Fisiologia della Donna_,     cap 9.)      The Indians of Central Brazil have no \"private parts.\" In men the     little girdle, or string, surrounding the lower part of the     abdomen, hides nothing; it is worn after puberty, the penis being     often raised and placed beneath it to lengthen the prepuce. The     women also use a little strip of bast that goes down the groin     and passes between the thighs. Among some tribes (Karibs, Tupis,     Nu-Arwaks) a little, triangular, coquettishly-made piece of     bark-bast comes just below the mons veneris; it is only a few     centimetres in width, and is called the _uluri. In both sexes     concealment of the sexual mucous membrane is attained_. These     articles cannot be called clothing. \"The red thread of the     Trumai, the elegant _uluri_, and the variegated flag of the     Bororó attract attention, like ornaments, instead of drawing     attention away.\" Von den Steinen thinks this proceeding a     necessary protection against the attacks of insects, which are     often serious in Brazil. He does think, however, that there is     more than this, and that the people are ashamed to show the     glans penis. (Karl von den Steinen, _Unter den Naturvölkern     Zentral-Brasiliens_, 1894, pp. 190 et seq.)      Other travelers mention that on the Amazon among some tribes the     women are clothed and the men naked; among others the women     naked, and the men clothed. Thus, among the Guaycurus the men are     quite naked, while the women wear a short petticoat; among the     Uaupás the men always wear a loin-cloth, while the women are     quite naked.      \"The feeling of modesty is very developed among the Fuegians, who     are accustomed to live naked. They manifest it in their bearing     and in the ease with which they show themselves in a state of     nudity, compared with the awkwardness, blushing, and shame which     both men and women exhibit if one gazes at certain parts of their     bodies. Among themselves this is never done even between husband     and wife. There is no Fuegian word for modesty, perhaps because     the feeling is universal among them.\" The women wear a minute     triangular garment of skin suspended between the thighs and never     removed, being merely raised during conjugal relations. (Hyades     and Deniker, _Mission Scientifique du Cap Horn_, vol. vii, pp.     239, 307, and 347.)      Among the Crow Indians of Montana, writes Dr. Holder, who has     lived with them for several years, \"a sense of modesty forbids     the attendance upon the female in labor of any male, white man or     Indian, physician or layman. This antipathy to receiving     assistance at the hands of the physician is overcome as the     tribes progress toward civilization, and it is especially     noticeable that half-breeds almost constantly seek the     physician's aid.\" Dr. Holder mentions the case of a young woman     who, although brought near the verge of death in a very difficult     first confinement, repeatedly refused to allow him to examine     her; at last she consented; \"her modest preparation was to take     bits of quilt and cover thighs and lips of vulva, leaving only     the aperture exposed.... Their modesty would not be so striking     were it not that, almost to a woman, the females of this tribe     are prostitutes, and for a consideration will admit the     connection of any man.\" (A.B. Holder, _American Journal of     Obstetrics_, vol. xxv, No. 6, 1892.)      \"In every North American tribe, from the most northern to the     most southern, the skirt of the woman is longer than that of the     men. In Esquimau land the _parka_ of deerskin and sealskin     reaches to the knees. Throughout Central North America the     buckskin dress of the women reached quite to the ankles. The     West-Coast women, from Oregon to the Gulf of California, wore a     petticoat of shredded bark, of plaited grass, or of strings, upon     which were strung hundreds of seeds. Even in the most tropical     areas the rule was universal, as anyone can see from the codices     or in pictures of the natives.\" (Otis T. Mason, _Woman's Share in     Primitive Culture_, p. 237.)      Describing the loin-cloth worn by Nicobarese men, Man says: \"From     the clumsy mode in which this garment is worn by the Shom     Pen--necessitating frequent readjustment of the folds--one is led     to infer that its use is not _de rigueur_, but reserved for     special occasions, as when receiving or visiting strangers.\"     (E.H. Man, _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1886, p.     442.)      The semi-nude natives of the island of Nias in the Indian Ocean     are \"modest by nature,\" paying no attention to their own nudity     or that of others, and much scandalized by any attempt to go     beyond the limits ordained by custom. When they pass near places     where women are bathing they raise their voices in order to warn     them of their presence, and even although any bold youth     addressed the women, and the latter replied, no attempt would be     made to approach them; any such attempt would be severely     punished by the head man of the village. (Modigliani, _Un Viaggio     a Nias_, p. 460.)      Man says that the Andamanese in modesty and self-respect compare     favorably with many classes among civilized peoples. \"Women are     so modest that they will not renew their leaf-aprons in the     presence of one another, but retire to a secluded spot for this     purpose; even when parting with one of their _bod_ appendages     [tails of leaves suspended from back of girdle] to a female     friend, the delicacy they manifest for the feelings of the     bystanders in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","mode of removing it amounts to prudishness;     yet they wear no clothing in the ordinary sense.\" (_Journal of     the Anthropological Institute_, 1883, pp. 94 and 331.)      Of the Garo women of Bengal Dalton says: \"Their sole garment is a     piece of cloth less than a foot in width that just meets around     the loins, and in order that it may not restrain the limbs it is     only fastened where it meets under the hip at the upper corners.     The girls are thus greatly restricted in the positions they may     modestly assume, but decorum is, in their opinion, sufficiently     preserved if they only keep their legs well together when they     sit or kneel.\" (E.T. Dalton, _Ethnology of Bengal_, 1872, p. 66.)      Of the Naga women of Assam it is said: \"Of clothing there was not     much to see; but in spite of this I doubt whether we could excel     them in true decency and modesty. Ibn Muhammed Wali had already     remarked in his history of the conquest of Assam (1662-63), that     the Naga women only cover their breasts. They declare that it is     absurd to cover those parts of the body which everyone has been     able to see from their births, but that it is different with the     breasts, which appeared later, and are, therefore, to be covered.     Dalton (_Journal of the Asiatic Society_, Bengal, 41, 1, 84) adds     that in the presence of strangers Naga women simply cross their     arms over their breasts, without caring much what other charms     they may reveal to the observer. As regards some clans of the     naked Nagas, to whom the Banpara belong, this may still hold     good.\" (K. Klemm, \"Peal's Ausflug nach Banpara,\" _Zeitschrift für     Ethnologie_, 1898, Heft 5, p. 334.)      \"In Ceylon, a woman always bathes in public streams, but she     never removes all her clothes. She washes under the cloth, bit by     bit, and then slips on the dry, new cloth, and pulls out the wet     one from underneath (much in the same sliding way as servant     girls and young women in England). This is the common custom in     India and the Malay States. The breasts are always bare in their     own houses, but in the public roads are covered whenever a     European passes. The vulva is never exposed. They say that a     devil, imagined as a white and hairy being, might have     intercourse with them.\" (Private communication.)      In Borneo, \"the _sirat_, called _chawal_ by the Malays, is a     strip of cloth a yard wide, worn round the loins and in between     the thighs, so as to cover the pudenda and perinæum; it is     generally six yards or so in length, but the younger men of the     present generation use as much as twelve or fourteen yards     (sometimes even more), which they twist and coil with great     precision round and round their body, until the waist and stomach     are fully enveloped in its folds.\" (H. Ling Roth, \"Low's Natives     of Borneo,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1892, p.     36.)      \"In their own houses in the depths of the forest the Dwarfs are     said to neglect coverings for decency in the men as in the women,     but certainly when they emerge from the forest into the villages     of the agricultural Negroes, they are always observed to be     wearing some small piece of bark-cloth or skin, or a bunch of     leaves over the pudenda. Elsewhere in all the regions of Africa     visited by the writer, or described by other observers, a neglect     of decency in the male has only been recorded among the Efik     people of Old Calabar. The nudity of women is another question.     In parts of West Africa, between the Niger and the Gaboon     (especially on the Cameroon River, at Old Calabar, and in the     Niger Delta), it is, or was, customary for young women to go     about completely nude before they were married. In Swaziland,     until quite recently, unmarried women and very often matrons went     stark naked. Even amongst the prudish Baganda, who made it a     punishable offense for a man to expose any part of his leg above     the knee, the wives of the King would attend at his Court     perfectly naked. Among the Kavirondo, all unmarried girls are     completely nude, and although women who have become mothers are     supposed to wear a tiny covering before and behind, they very     often completely neglect to do so when in their own villages.     Yet, as a general rule, among the Nile Negroes, and still more     markedly among the Hamites and people of Masai stock, the women     are particular about concealing the pudenda, whereas the men are     ostentatiously naked. The Baganda hold nudity in the male to be     such an abhorrent thing that for centuries they have referred     with scorn and disgust to the Nile Negroes as the 'naked people.'     Male nudity extends northwest to within some 200 miles of     Khartum, or, in fact, wherever the Nile Negroes of the     Dinka-Acholi stock inhabit the country.\" (Sir H.H. Johnston,     _Uganda Protectorate_, vol. ii, pp. 669-672.)      Among the Nilotic Ja-luo, Johnston states that \"unmarried men go     naked. Married men who have children wear a small piece of goat     skin, which, though quite inadequate for purposes of decency, is,     nevertheless, a very important thing in etiquette, for a married     man with a child must on no account call on his mother-in-law     without wearing this piece of goat's skin. To call on her in a     state of absolute nudity would be regarded as a serious insult,     only to be atoned for by the payment of goats. Even if under the     new dispensation he wears European trousers, he must have a piece     of goat's skin underneath. Married women wear a tail of strings     behind.\" It is very bad manners for a woman to serve food to her     husband without putting on this tail. (Sir H.H. Johnston, _Uganda     Protectorate_, vol. ii, p. 781.)      Mrs. French-Sheldon remarks that the Masai and other East African     tribes, with regard to menstruation, \"observe the greatest     delicacy, and are more than modest.\" (_Journal of the     Anthropological Institute_, 1894, p. 383.)      At the same time the Masai, among whom the penis is of enormous     size, consider it disreputable to conceal that member, and in the     highest degree reputable to display it, even ostentatiously. (Sir     H.H. Johnston, _Kilima-njaro Expedition_, p. 413.)      Among the African Dinka, who are scrupulously clean and delicate     (smearing themselves with burnt cows' dung, and washing     themselves daily with cows' urine), and are exquisite cooks,     reaching in many respects a higher stage of civilization, in     Schweinfurth's opinion, than is elsewhere attained in Africa,     only the women wear aprons. The neighboring tribes of the red     soil--Bongo, Mittoo, Niam-Niam, etc.--are called \"women\" by the     Dinka, because among these tribes the men wear an apron, while     the women obstinately refuse to wear any clothes whatsoever of     skin or stuff, going into the woods every day, however, to get a     supple bough for a girdle, with, perhaps, a bundle of fine grass.     (Schweinfurth, _Heart of Africa_, vol. i, pp. 152, etc.)      Lombroso and Carrara, examining some Dinka negroes brought from     the White Nile, remark: \"As to their psychology, what struck us     first was the exaggeration of their modesty; not in a single case     would the men allow us to examine their genital organs or the     women their breasts; we examined the tattoo-marks on the chest of     one of the women, and she remained sad and irritable for two days     afterward.\" They add that in sexual and all other respects these     people are highly moral. (Lombroso and Carrara, _Archivio di     Psichiatria_, 1896, vol. xvii, fasc. 4.)      \"The negro is very rarely knowingly indecent or addicted to     lubricity,\" says Sir H.H. Johnston. \"In this land of nudity,     which I have known for seven years, I do not remember once having     seen an indecent gesture on the part of either man or woman, and     only very rarely (and that not among unspoiled savages) in the     case of that most shameless member of the community--the little     boy.\" He adds that the native dances are only an apparent     exception, being serious in character, though indecent to our     eyes, almost constituting a religious ceremony. The only really     indecent dance indigenous to Central Africa \"is one which     originally represented the act of coition, but it is so altered     to a stereotyped formula that its exact purport is not obvious     until explained somewhat shyly by the natives.... It may safely     be asserted that the negro race in Central Africa is much more     truly modest, is much more free from real vice, than are most     European nations. Neither boys nor girls wear clothing (unless     they are the children of chiefs) until nearing the age of     puberty. Among the Wankonda, practically no covering is worn by     the men except a ring of brass wire around the stomach. The     Wankonda women are likewise almost entirely naked, but generally     cover the pudenda with a tiny bead-work apron, often a piece of     very beautiful workmanship, and exactly resembling the same     article worn by Kaffir women. A like degree of nudity prevails     among many of the Awemba, among the A-lungu, the Batumbuka, and     the Angoni. Most of the Angoni men, however, adopt the Zulu     fashion of covering the glans penis with a small wooden case or     the outer shell of a fruit. The Wa-Yao have a strong sense of     decency in matters of this kind, which is the more curious since     they are more given to obscenity in their rites, ceremonies, and     dances than any other tribe. Not only is it extremely rare to see     any Yao uncovered, but both men and women have the strongest     dislike to exposing their persons even to the inspection of a     doctor. The Atonga and many of the A-nyanga people, and all the     tribes west of Nyassa (w"]]]
