It thus happens that tumescence, or even in extreme cases detumescence, may be provoked by the contemplation of acts or objects which are away from the end of sexual conjugation.[1]  In considering the phenomena of sexual selection in a previous volume,[2] it was found that there are four or five main factors in the constitution of beauty in so far as beauty determines sexual selection. Erotic symbolism is founded on the factor of individual taste in beauty; it arises as a specialized development of that factor, but it is, nevertheless, incorrect to merge it in sexual selection. The attractive characteristics of a beloved woman or man, from the point of view of sexual selection, are a complex but harmonious whole leading up to a desire for the complete possession of the person who displays them. There is no tendency to isolate and dissociate any single character from the individual and to concentrate attention upon that character at the expense of the attention bestowed upon the individual generally. As soon as such a tendency begins to show itself, even though only in a slight or temporary form, we may say that there is erotic symbolism.  Erotic symbolism is, however, by no means confined to the individualizing tendency to concentrate amorous attention upon some single characteristic of the adult woman or man who is normally the object of sexual love. The adult human being may not be concerned at all, the attractive object or act may not even be human, not even animal, and we may still be concerned with a symbol which has parasitically rooted itself on the fruitful site of sexual emotion and absorbed to itself the energy which normally goes into the channels of healthy human love having for its final end the procreation of the species. Thus understood in its widest sense, it may be said that every sexual perversion, even homosexuality, is a form of erotic symbolism, for we shall find that in every case some object or act that for the normal human being has little or no erotic value, has assumed such value in a supreme degree; that is to say, it has become a symbol of the normal object of love. Certain perversions are, however, of such great importance on account of their wide relationships, that they cannot be adequately discussed merely as forms of erotic symbolism. This is notably the case as regards homosexuality, auto-erotism, and algolagnia, all of which phenomena have therefore been separately discussed in previous studies. We are now mainly concerned with manifestations which are more narrowly and exclusively symbolical.  A portion of the field of erotic symbolism is covered by what Binet (followed by Lombroso, Krafft-Ebing, and others) has termed \"erotic fetichism,\" or the tendency whereby sexual attraction is unduly exerted by some special part or peculiarity of the body, or by some inanimate object which has become associated with it. Such erotic symbolism of object cannot, however, be dissociated from the even more important erotic symbolism of process, and the two are so closely bound together that we cannot attain a truly scientific view of them until we regard them broadly as related parts of a common psychic tendency. If, as Groos asserts,[3] a symbol has two chief meanings, one in which it indicates a physical process which stands for a psychic process, and another in which it indicates a part which represents the whole, erotic symbolism of act corresponds to the first of these chief meanings, and erotic symbolism of object to the other.  Although it is not impossible to find some germs of erotic symbolism in animals, in its more pronounced manifestations it is only found in the human species. It could not be otherwise, for such symbolism involves not only the play of fancy and imagination, the idealizing aptitude, but also a certain amount of power of concentrating the attention on a point outside the natural path of instinct and the ability to form new mental constructions around that point. There are, indeed, as we shall see, elementary forms of erotic symbolism which are not uncommonly associated with feeble-mindedness, but even these are still peculiarly human, and in its less crude manifestations erotic symbolism easily lends itself to every degree of human refinement and intelligence.      \"It depends primarily upon an increase of the psychological     process of representation,\" Colin Scott remarks of sexual     symbolism generally, \"involving greater powers of comparison and     analysis as compared with the lower animals. The outer     impressions come to be clearly distinguished as such, but at the     same time are often treated as symbols of inner experiences, and     a meaning read into them which they would not otherwise possess.     Symbolism or fetichism is, indeed, just the capacity to see     meaning, to emphasize something for the sake of other things     which do not appear. In brain terms it indicates an activity of     the higher centers, a sort of side-tracking or long-circuiting of     the primitive energy; ... Rosetti's poem, 'The Woodspurge,'     gives a concrete example of the formation of such a symbol. Here     the otherwise insignificant presentation of the three-cupped     woodspurge, representing originally a mere side-current of the     stream of consciousness, becomes the intellectual symbol or     fetich of the whole psychosis forever after. It seems, indeed, as     if the stronger the emotion the more likely will become the     formation of an overlying symbolism, which serves to focus and     stand in the place of something greater than itself; nowhere at     least is symbolism a more characteristic feature than as an     expression of the sexual instinct. The passion of sex, with its     immense hereditary background, in early man became centered often     upon the most trivial and unimportant features.... This     symbolism, now become fetichistic, or symbolic in a bad sense, is     at least an exercise of the increasing representative power of     man, upon which so much of his advancement has depended, while it     also served to express and help to purify his most perennial     emotion.\" (Colin Scott, \"Sex and Art,\" _American Journal of     Psychology_, vol. vii, No. 2, p. 189.)  In the study of \"Love and Pain\" in a previous volume, the analysis of the large and complex mass of sexual phenomena which are associated with pain, gradually resolved them to a considerable extent into a special case of erotic symbolism; pain or restraint, whether inflicted on or by the loved person, becomes, by a psychic process that is usually unconscious, the symbol of the sexual mechanism, and hence arouses the same emotions as that mechanism normally arouses. We may now attempt to deal more broadly and comprehensively with the normal and abnormal aspects of erotic symbolism in some of their most typical and least mixed forms.  \"When our human imagination seeks to animate artificial things,\" Huysmans writes in _Là-bas_, \"it is compelled to reproduce the movements of animals in the act of propagation. Look at machines, at the play of pistons in the cylinders; they are Romeos of steel in Juliets of cast-iron.\" And not only in the work of man's hands but throughout Nature we find sexual symbols which are the less deniable since, for the most part, they make not the slightest appeal to even the most morbid human imagination. Language is full of metaphorical symbols of sex which constantly tend to lose their poetic symbolism and to become commonplace. Semen is but seed, and for the Latins especially the whole process of human sex, as well as the male and female organs, constantly presented itself in symbols derived from agricultural and horticultural life. The testicles were beans (_fabæ_) and fruit or apples (_poma_ and _mala_); the penis was a tree (_arbor_), or a stalk (_thyrsus_), or a root (_radix_), or a sickle (_falx_), or a ploughshare (_vomer_). The semen, again, was dew (_ros_). The labia majora or minora were wings (_alæ_); the vulva and vagina were a field (_ager_ and _campus_), or a ploughed furrow (_sulcus_), or a vineyard (_vinea_), or a fountain (_fons_), while the pudendal hair was herbage (_plantaria_).[4] In other languages it is not difficult to trace similar and even identical imagery applied to sexual organs and sexual acts. Thus it is noteworthy that Shakespeare more than once applies the term \"ploughed\" to a woman who has had sexual intercourse. The Talmud calls the labia minora the doors, the labia majora hinges, and the clitoris the key. The Greeks appear not only to have found in the myrtle-berry, the fruit of a plant sacred to Venus, the image of the clitoris, but also in the rose an image of the feminine labia; in the poetic literature of many countries, indeed, this imagery of the rose may be traced in a more or less veiled manner.[5]  The widespread symbolism of sex arose in the theories and conceptions of primitive peoples concerning the function of generation and its nearest analogies in Nature; it was continued for the sake of the vigorous and expressive terminology which it furnished both for daily life and for literature; its final survivals were cultivated because they furnished a delicately æsthetic method of approaching matters which a growing refinement of sentiment made it difficult for lovers and poets to approach in a more crude and direct manner. Its existence is of interest to us now because it shows the objective validity of the basis on which erotic symbolism, as we have here to understand it, develops. But from first to last it is a distinct phenomenon, having a more or less reasoned and intellectual basis, and it scarcely serves in any degree to feed the sexual impulse. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#2)"],["body","symbolism is not intellectual but emotional in its origin; it starts into being, obscurely, with but a dim consciousness or for the most part none at all, either suddenly from the shock of some usually youthful experience, or more gradually through an instinctive brooding on those things which are most intimately associated with a sexually desirable person.      The kind of soil on which the germs of erotic symbolism may     develop is well seen in cases of sexual hyperæsthesia. In such     cases all the emotionally sexual analogies and resemblances,     which in erotic symbolism are fixed and organized, may be traced     in vague and passing forms, a single hyperæsthetic individual     perhaps presenting a great variety of germinal symbolisms.      Thus it has been recorded of an Italian nun (whose sister became     a prostitute) that from the age of 8 she had desire for coitus,     from the age of 10 masturbated, and later had homosexual     feelings, that the same feelings and practices continued after     she had taken the veil, though from time to time they assumed     religious equivalents. The mere contact, indeed, of a priest's     hand, the news of the presentation of an ecclesiastic she had     known to a bishopric, the sight of an ape, the contemplation of     the crucified Christ, the figure of a toy, the picture of a     demon, the act of defecation in the children entrusted to her     care (whom, on this account, and against the regulations, she     would accompany to the closets), especially the sight and the     mere recollection of flies in sexual connection--all these things     sufficed to produce in her a powerful orgasm. (_Archivio di     Psichiatria_, 1902, fasc. II-III, p. 338.)      A boy of 15 (given to masturbation), studied by Macdonald in     America, was similarly hyperæsthetic to the symbols of sexual     emotion. \"I like amusing myself with my comrades,\" he told     Macdonald, \"rolling ourselves into a ball, which gives one a     funny kind of warmth. I have a special pleasure in talking about     some things. It is the same when the governess kisses me on     saying good night or when I lean against her breast. I have that     sensation, too, when I see some of the pictures in the comic     papers, but only in those representing a woman, as when a young     man skating trips up a girl so that her clothes are raised a     little. When I read how a man saved a young girl from drowning,     so that they swam together, I had the same sensation. Looking at     the statues of women in the museum produces the same effect, or     when I see naked babies, or when a mother suckles a child. I     have often had that sensation when reading novels I ought not to     read, or when looking at a new-born calf, or seeing dogs and cows     and horses mounting on each other. When I see a girl flirting     with a boy, or leaning on his shoulder or with his arm round her     waist, I have an erection. It is the same when I see women and     little girls in bathing costume, or when boys talk of what their     fathers and mothers do together. In the Natural History Museum I     often see things which give me that sensation. One day when I     read how a man killed a young girl and carried her into a wood     and undressed her I had a feeling of enjoyment. When I read of     men who were bastards the idea of a woman having a child in that     way gives me this sensation. Some dances, and seeing young girls     astride a horse, excited me, too, and so in a circus when a woman     was shot out of a cannon and her skirts flew in the air. It has     no effect on me when I see men naked. Sometimes I enjoy seeing     women's underclothes in a shop, or when I see a lady or a girl     buying them, especially if they are drawers. When I saw a lady in     a dress which buttoned from top to bottom it had more effect on     me than seeing underclothes. Seeing dogs coupling gives me more     pleasure than looking at pretty women, but less than looking at     pretty little girls.\" In order of increasing intensity he placed     the phenomena that affected him thus: The coupling of flies, then     of horses, then the sight of women's undergarments, then a boy     and a girl flirting, then cows mounting on each other, the     statues of women with naked breasts, then contact with the     governess's body and breasts, finally coitus. (Arthur Macdonald,     _Le Criminel-Type_, pp. 126 et seq.)      It is worthy of remark that the instinct of nutrition, when     restrained, may exhibit something of an analogous symbolism,     though in a minor degree, to that of sex. The ways in which a     hyperæsthetic hunger may seek its symbols are illustrated in the     case of a young woman called Nadia, who during several years was     carefully studied by Janet. It is a case of obsession (\"maladie     du scrupule\"), simulating hysterical anorexia, in which the     patient, for fear of getting fat, reduced her nourishment to the     smallest possible amount. \"Nadia is generally hungry, even very     hungry. One can tell this by her actions; from time to time she     forgets herself to such an extent as to devour greedily anything     she can put her hands on. At other times, when she cannot resist     the desire to eat, she secretly takes a biscuit. She feels     horrible remorse for the action, but, all the same, she does it     again. Her confidences are very curious. She recognizes that a     great effort is needed to avoid eating, and considers she is a     heroine to resist so long. 'Sometimes I spent whole hours in     thinking about food, I was so hungry; I swallowed my saliva, I     bit my handkerchief, I rolled on the floor, I wanted to eat so     badly. I would look in books for descriptions of meals and     feasts, and tried to deceive my hunger by imagining that I was     sharing all these good things,'\" (P. Janet, \"La Maladie du     Scrupule,\" _Revue Philosophique_, May, 1901, p. 502.) The     deviations of the instinct of nutrition are, however, confined     within narrow limits, and, in the nature of things, hunger,     unlike sexual desire, cannot easily accept a fetich.  \"There is almost no feature, article of dress, attitude, act,\" Stanley Hall declares, \"or even animal or perhaps object in nature, that may not have to some morbid soul specialized erogenic and erethic power.\"[6] Even a mere shadow may become a fetich. Goron tells of a merchant in Paris--a man with a reputation for ability, happily married and the father of a family, altogether irreproachable in his private life--who was returning home one evening after a game of billiards with a friend, when, on chancing to raise his eyes, he saw against a lighted window the shadow of a woman changing her chemise. He fell in love with that shadow and returned to the spot every evening for many months to gaze at the window. Yet--and herein lies the fetichism--he made no attempt to see the woman or to find out who she was; the shadow sufficed; he had no need of the realty.[7] It is even possible to have a negative fetich, the absence of some character being alone demanded, and the case has been recorded in Chicago of an American gentleman of average intelligence, education, and good habits who, having as a boy cherished a pure affection for a girl whose leg had been amputated, throughout life was relatively impotent with normal women, but experienced passion and affection for women who had lost a leg; he was found by his wife to be in extensive correspondence with one-legged women all over the country, expending no little money on the purchase of artificial legs for his various protegées.[8]  It is important to remember, however, that while erotic symbolism becomes fantastic and abnormal in its extreme manifestations, it is in its essence absolutely normal. It is only in the very grossest forms of sexual desire that it is altogether absent. Stendhal described the mental side of the process of tumescence as a crystallization, a process whereby certain features of the beloved person present points around which the emotions held in solution in the lover's mind may concentrate and deposit themselves in dazzling brilliance. This process inevitably tends to take place around all those features and objects associated with the beloved person which have most deeply impressed the lover's mind, and the more sensitive and imaginative and emotional he is the more certainly will such features and objects crystallize into erotic symbols. \"Devotion and love,\" wrote Mary Wollstonecraft, \"may be allowed to hallow the garments as well as the person, for the lover must want fancy who has not a sort of sacred respect for the glove or slipper of his mistress. He would not confound them with vulgar things of the same kind.\" And nearly two centuries earlier Burton, who had gathered together so much of the ancient lore of love, clearly asserted the entirely normal character of erotic symbolism. \"Not one of a thousand falls in love,\" he declares, \"but there is some peculiar part or other which pleaseth most, and inflames him above the rest.... If he gets any remnant of hers, a busk-point, a feather of her fan, a shoe-tie, a lace, a ring, a bracelet of hair, he wears it for a favor on his arm, in his hat, finger, or next his heart; as Laodamia did by Protesilaus, when he went to war, sit at home with his picture before her: a garter or a bracelet of hers is more precious than any Saint's Relique, he lays it up in his casket (O blessed Relique) and every day will kiss it: if in her presence his eye is never off her, and drink he will where she drank, if it be possible, in that very place,\" etc.[9]      Burton's accuracy in describing the ways of lovers in his century     is shown by a passage in Hamilton's _Mémoires de Gramont_. Miss     Price, one of the beauties of Charles II's court, and Dongan were     tenderly attached to each other; when the latter died he left     behind a"]]]
