The reddish-yellow tracts are doubtless continents of an ochrey soil; and not, as some think, of a ruddy vegetation. The greenish-grey patches are probably seas and lakes. The land and water are better mixed on Mars than on the earth--a fact which tends to equalise the climate. There is a belt of continents round the equator: 'Copernicus,' 'Galileo,' 'Dawes,' and others, having long winding lakes and inlets. These are separated by narrow seas from other islands on the north or south, such as: 'Haze Land, 'Storm Land,' and so forth, which occupy what we should call the temperate zones, beneath the poles; but I suspect they are frigid enough. If you look closely you will see some narrow streaks crossing the continents like fractures. These are the famous 'Canals' of Schiaparelli, who discovered (and I wish I had his eyes) that many of them were 'doubled,' that is, had another canal alongside. Some of these are nearly 2,000 miles long, by fifty miles broad, and 300 miles apart.\"  \"That beats the Suez Canal.\"  \"I am afraid they are not artificial. The doubling is chiefly observed at the vernal equinox, our month of May, and is perhaps due to spring floods, or vegetation in valleys of the like trend, as we find in Siberia. The massing of clouds or mists will account for the peculiar whiteness at the edge of the limb, and an occasional veiling of the landscape.\"  While he spoke, my attention was suddenly arrested by a vivid point of light which appeared on the dark side of the terminator, and south of the equator.  \"Hallo!\" I exclaimed, involuntarily. \"There's a light!\"  \"Really!\" responded Gazen, in a tone of surprise, not unmingled with doubt. \"Are you sure?\"  \"Quite. There is a distinct light on one of the continents.\"  \"Let me see it, will you?\" he rejoined, hastily; and I yielded up my place to him.  \"Why, so there is,\" he declared, after a pause. \"I suspect it has been hidden under a cloud till now.\"  We turned and looked at each other in silence.  \"It can't be the light Javelle saw,\" ejaculated Gazen at length. \"That was on Hellas Land.\"  \"Should the Martians be signalling they would probably use a system of lights. I daresay they possess an electric telegraph to work it.\"  The professor put his eye to the glass again, and I awaited the result of his observation with eager interest.  \"It's as steady as possible,\" said he.  \"The steadiness puzzles me,\" I replied. \"If it would only flash I should call it a signal.\"  \"Not necessarily to us,\" said Gazen, with mock gravity. \"You see, it might be a lighthouse flashing on the Kaiser Sea, or a night message in the autumn manoeuvres of the Martians, who are, no doubt, very warlike; or even the advertisement of a new soap.\"  \"Seriously, what do you think of it?\" I asked.  \"I confess it's a mystery to me,\" he answered, pondering deeply; and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he added: \"I wonder if it's any good trying the spectroscope on it?\"  So saying, he attached to the telescope a magnificent spectroscope, which he employed in his researches on the nebulæ, and renewed his observation.  \"Well, that's the most remarkable thing in all my professional experience,\" he exclaimed, resigning his place at the instrument to me.  \"What is?\" I demanded, looking into the spectroscope, where I could distinguish several faint streaks of coloured light on a darker background.  \"You know that we can tell the nature of a substance that is burning by splitting up the light which comes from it in the prism of a spectroscope. Well, these bright lines of different colours are the spectrum of a luminous gas.\"  \"Indeed! Have you any idea as to the origin of the blaze?\"  \"It may be electrical--for instance, an aurora. It may be a volcanic eruption, or a lake of fire such as the crater of Kilauea. Really, I can't say. Let me see if I can identify the bright lines of the spectrum.\"  I yielded the spectroscope to him, and scarcely had he looked into it ere he cried out--  \"By all that's wonderful, the spectrum has changed. Eureka! It's thallium now. I should know that splendid green line amongst a thousand.\"  \"Thallium!\" I exclaimed, astonished in my turn.  \"Yes,\" responded Gazen, hurriedly. \"Make a note of the observation, and also of the time. You will find a book for the purpose lying on the desk.\"  I did as directed, and awaited further orders. The silence was so great that I could plainly hear the ticking of my watch laid on the desk before me. At the end of several minutes the professor cried--  \"It has changed again: make another note.\"  \"What is it now?\"  \"Sodium. The yellow bands are unmistakable.\"  A deep stillness reigned as before.  \"There she goes again,\" exclaimed the professor, much excited. \"Now I can see a couple of blue lines. What can that be? I believe it's indium.\"  Another long pause ensued.  \"Now they are gone,\" ejaculated Gazen once more. \"A red and a yellow line have taken their place. That should be lithium. Hey, presto!--and all was dark.\"  \"What's the matter?\"  \"It's all over.\" With these words he removed the spectroscope from the telescope, and gazed anxiously at the planet \"The light is gone,\" he continued, after a minute. \"Perhaps another cloud is passing over it. Well, we must wait. In the meantime let us consider the situation. It seems to me that we have every reason to be satisfied with our night's work. What do you think?\"  There was a glow of triumph on his countenance as he came and stood before me.  \"I believe it's a signal,\" said I, with an air of conviction.  \"But how?\"  \"Why should it change so regularly? I've timed each spectrum, and found it to last about five minutes before another took its place.\"  The professor remained thoughtful and silent.  \"Is it not by the light which comes from them that we have gained all our knowledge of the constitution of the heavenly bodies?\" I continued. \"A ray from the remotest star brings in its heart a secret message to him who can read it. Now, the Martians would naturally resort to the same medium of communication as the most obvious, simple, and practicable. By producing a powerful light they might hope to attract our attention, and by imbuing it with characteristic spectra, easily recognised and changed at intervals, they would distinguish the light from every other, and show us that it must have had an intelligent origin.\"  \"What then?\"  \"We should know that the Martians had a civilisation at least as high as our own. To my mind, that would be a great discovery--the greatest since the world began.\"  \"But of little use to either party.\"  \"As for that, a good many of our discoveries, especially in astronomy, are not of much use. Suppose you find out the chemical composition of the nebulæ you are studying, will that lower the price of bread? No; but it will interest and enlighten us. If the Martians can tell us what Mars is made of, and we can return the compliment as regards the earth, that will be a service.\"  \"But the correspondence must then cease, as the editors say.\"  \"I'm not so sure of that.\"  \"My dear fellow! How on earth are we to understand what the Martians say, and how on Mars are they to understand what we say? We have no common code.\"  \"True; but the chemical bodies have certain well-defined properties, have they not?\"  \"Yes. Each has a peculiarity marking it from all the rest. For example, two or more may resemble each other in colour or hardness, but not in weight.\"  \"Precisely. Now, by comparing their spectra can we not be led to distinguish a particular quality, and grasp the idea of it? In short, can the Martians not impress that idea on us by their spectro-telegraph?\"  \"I see what you mean,\" said Professor Gazen; \"and, now I think of it, all the spectra we have seen belong to the group called 'metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths,' which, of course, have distinctive properties.\"  \"At first, I should think the Martians would only try to attract our notice by striking spectra.\"  \"Lithium is the lightest metal known to us.\"  \"Well, we might get the idea of 'lightness' from that.\"  \"Sodium,\" continued the professor, \"sodium is a very soft metal, with so strong an affinity for oxygen that it burns in water. Manganese, which belongs to the 'iron group,' is hard enough to scratch glass; and, like iron, is decidedly magnetic. Copper is red--\"  \"The signals for colour we might get from the spectra direct.\"  \"Mercury or quicksilver is fluid at ordinary temperatures, and that might lead us to the idea of movement--animation--life itself.\"  \"Having got certain fundamental ideas,\" I went on, \"by combining these we might arrive at other distinct conceptions. We might build up an ideographic or glyphic language of signs--the signs being spectra. The numerals might be telegraphed by simple occultations of the light. Then from spectra we might pass by an easy step to equivalent signals of long and short flashes in various combinations, also made by occulting the light. With such a code, our correspondence might go on at great length, and present no difficulty; but, of course, we must be able to reply.\"  \"If the Martians are as clever as you are pleased to imagine, we ought to learn a good deal from them.\"  \"I hope we may, and I'm sure the world will be all the better for a little superior enlightenment on some points.\"  \"Well, we must follow the matter up, at all events,\" said the professor, taking another peep through the telescope. \"For the present the Martian philosophers appear to have shut up shop; and, as my nebula has now risen, I should like to do a little work on it before daybreak. Look here, if it's a fine night, can you join me to-morrow? We shall then continue our "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13716"],["title","A Trip to Venus: A Novel (#2)"],["body","observations; but, in the meanwhile, you had better say nothing about them.\"  On my way home I looked for the ruddy planet as I had done in the earlier part of the night, but with very different feelings in my heart. The ice of distance and isolation separating me from it seemed to have broken down since then, and instead of a cold and alien star, I saw a friendly and familiar world--a companion to our own in the eternal solitude of the universe.     CHAPTER II.  HOW CAN WE GET TO THE OTHER PLANETS?   The next evening promised well, and I kept my appointment, but unfortunately a slight haze gathered in the sky and prevented us from making further observations. While hoping in vain for it to clear away, Professor Gazen and I talked over the possibility of journeying to other worlds. The gist of our argument was afterwards published in a conversation, entitled \"Can we reach the other planets?\" which appeared in _The Day after To-morrow_. It ran as follows:  _I_. (_the writer_). \"Do you think we shall ever be able to leave the earth and travel through space to Mars or Venus, and the other members of the Solar System?\"  _G_. (_Checking an impulse to smile and shaking his head_), \"Oh, no! Never.\"  _I_. \"Yet science is working miracles, or what would have been accounted miracles in ancient times.\"  _G_. \"No doubt, and hence people are apt to suppose that science can do everything; but after all Nature has set bounds to her achievements.\"  _I_. \"Still, we don't know what we can and what we cannot do until we try.\"  _G_. \"Not always; but in this case I think we know. The celestial bodies are evidently isolated in space, and the tenants of one cannot pass to another. We are confined to our own planet.\"  _I_. \"A similar objection might have been urged against the plan of Columbus.\"  _G_. \"That was different. Columbus only sailed through unknown seas to a distant continent. We are free to explore every nook and cranny of the earth, but how shall we cross the immense void which parts us from another world, except on the wings of the imagination?\"  _I_. \"Great discoveries and inventions are born of dreams. There are minds which can foresee what lies before us, and the march of science brings it within our reach. All or nearly all our great scientific victories have been foretold, and they have generally been achieved by more than one person when the time came. The telescope was a dream for ages, so was the telephone, steam and electric locomotion, aerial navigation. Why should we scout the dream of visiting other worlds, which is at least as old as Lucian? Ere long, and perhaps before the century is out, we shall be flying through the air to the various countries of the globe. In succeeding centuries what is to hinder us from travelling through space to different planets?\"  _G_. \"Quite impossible. Consider the tremendous distance--the lifeless vacuum--that separates us even from the moon. Two hundred and forty thousand miles of empty space.\"  _I_. \"Some ten times round the world. Well, is that tremendous vacuum absolutely impassable?\"  _G_. \"To any but Jules Verne and his hero, the illustrious Barbicane, president of the Gun Club.\"[1]      [Footnote 1: _The Voyage à la Lune_, by Jules Verne.]  _I_. \"Jules Verne has an original mind, and his ideas, though extravagant, are not without value. Some of them have been realised, and it may be worth while to examine his notion of firing a shot from the earth to the moon. The projectile, if I remember, was an aluminium shell in the shape of a conical bullet, and contained three men, a dog or two, and several fowls, together with provisions and instruments. It was air tight, warmed and illuminated with coal gas, and the oxygen for breathing was got from chlorate of potash, while the carbonic acid produced by the lungs and gas-burners was absorbed with caustic potash to keep the air pure. This bullet-car was fired from a colossal cast-iron gun founded in the sand. It was aimed at a point in the sky, the zenith, in fact, where it would strike the moon four days later, that is, after it had crossed the intervening space. The charge of gun-cotton was calculated to give the projectile a velocity sufficient to carry it past the 'dead-point,' where the gravity of the earth upon it was just balanced by that of the moon, and enable it to fall towards the moon for the rest of the way. The sudden shock of the discharge on the car and its occupants was broken by means of spring buffers and water pressure.\"  _G_. \"The last arrangement was altogether inadequate.\"  _I_. \"It was certainly a defect in the scheme.\"  _G_. \"Besides, the initial velocity of the bullet to carry it beyond the 'dead-point,' was, I think, 12,000 yards a second, or something like seven miles a second.\"  _I_. \"His estimate was too high. An initial velocity of 9,000 yards, or five miles a second, would carry a projectile beyond the sensible attraction of the earth towards the moon, the planets, or anywhere; in short, to an infinite distance. Indeed, a slightly lower velocity would suffice in the case of the moon, owing to her attraction.\"  _G_. \"But how are we to give the bullet that velocity? I believe the highest velocity obtained from a single discharge of cordite, one of our best explosives, was rather less than 4,000 feet, or only about three-quarters of a mile per second. With such a velocity, the projectile would simply rise to a great height and then fall back to the ground.\"  _I_. \"Both of these drawbacks can be overcome. We are not limited to a single discharge. Dr. S. Tolver Preston, the well-known writer on molecular science, has pointed out that a very high velocity can be got by the use of a compound gun, or, in other words, a gun which fires another gun as a projectile.[2] Imagine a first gun of enormous dimensions loaded with a smaller gun, which in turn is loaded with the bullet. The discharge of the first gun shoots the second gun into the air, with a certain velocity. If, now, the second gun, at the instant it leaves the muzzle of the first, is fired automatically, say by utilising the first discharge to press a spring which can react on a hammer or needle, the bullet will acquire a velocity due to both discharges, and equivalent to the velocity of the second gun at the time it was fired plus the velocity produced by the explosion of its own charge. In this way, by employing a series of guns, fired from each other in succession, we can graduate the starting shock, and give the bullet a final velocity sufficient to raise it against gravity, and the resistance of the atmosphere, which grows less as it advances, and send it away to the moon or some other distant orb.\"      [Footnote 2: _Engineering_, January 13th, 1893.]  _G_. \"Your spit-fire mode of progression is well enough in theory, but it strikes me as just a little complicated and risky. I, for one, shouldn't care to emulate Elijah and shoot up to Heaven in that style.\"  _I_. \"If it be all right in theory, it will be all right in practice. However, instead of explosives we might employ compressed air to get the required velocity. In the air-gun or cannon, as you probably know, a quantity of air, compressed within a chamber of the breech, is allowed suddenly to expand behind the bullet and eject it from the barrel. Now, one might manage with a simple gun of this sort, provided it had a very long barrel, and a series of air chambers at intervals from the breech to the muzzle. Each of these chambers, beginning at the breech, could be opened in turn as the bullet passed along the barrel, so that every escaping jet of gas would give it an additional impulse.\"  _G._ (_with growing interest_). \"That sounds neater. You might work the chambers by electricity.\"  _I_. \"We could even have an electric gun. Conceive a bobbin wound with insulated wire in lieu of thread, and having the usual hole through the axis of the frame. If a current of electricity be sent through the wire, the bobbin will become a hollow magnet or 'solenoid,' and a plug of soft iron placed at one end will be sucked into the hole. In this experiment we have the germ of a solenoid cannon. The bobbin stands for the gun-barrel, the plug for the bullet-car, and the magnetism for the ejecting force. We can arrange the wire and current so as to draw the plug or car right through the hole or barrel, and if we have a series of solenoids end to end in one straight line, we can switch the current through each in succession, and send the projectile with gathering velocity through the interior of them all. In practice the barrel would consist of a long straight tube, wide and strong enough to contain the bullet-car without flexure, and begirt with giant solenoids at intervals. Each of the solenoids would be excited by a powerful current, one after the other, so as to urge the projectile with accelerating speed along the tube, and launch it into the vast.\"  _G_. \"That looks still better than the pneumatic gun.\"  _I_. \"A magnetic gun would have several advantages. For instance, the currents can be sent through the solenoids in turn as quickly as we desire by means of a commutator in a convenient spot, for instance, at the butt end of the gun, so as to follow up the bullet with ease, and give it a planetary flight. By a proper adjustment of the solenoids and currents, this could be done so gradually as to prevent a starting shock to the occupants of the car. The velocity attained by the car would, of course, depend on the number and power of the solenoids. If, for example, each solenoid communicated to the car a velocity of nine yards per second, a thousand solenoids, each magnetically stronger than another in going from breech to muzzle, would be required to give a final velocity of five miles a second. In such a case, the length of the barrel would be at least 1,000 yards. Economy and safety would determine the best proportions for the gun, but we are now considering the feasibility of the project, not its"]]]
