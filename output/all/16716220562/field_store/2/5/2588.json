She brought up the rear of the train of servants gathering in the hall to welcome their master and mistress.  A glad welcome it was; for both Lester and Elsie were greatly beloved by their dependents; and Evelyn, too, came in for a share of the hand-shakings, the \"God bless yous,\" and was assured again and again that she was welcome to Fairview.  \"Well, Aunt Kitty, I suppose you have one of your excellent suppers ready for us hungry travelers?\" remarked Mr. Leland interrogatively, as he divested himself of his duster.  \"I'se done de wery bes' I knows, sah,\" she answered, dropping a courtesy and smiling all over her face. \"Eberyting am done to a turn, an' I hopes you, sah, and de ladies mos' ready to eat afo' de tings get spoiled.\"  \"We won't keep your supper waiting many minutes, Aunt Kitty,\" said her mistress pleasantly.  \"Myra take the baby to the nursery. Evelyn, my dear, we will go up stairs and I will show you your room.\"  Reaching the second floor, Elsie led the way into a spacious, luxuriously-furnished apartment.  \"This is your room, Eva,\" she said.  \"It is just across the hall from your uncle's and mine; so I hope you will not feel lonely or timid. But if anything should alarm you at any time, come to our door and call to us.\"  \"Thank you, dear Aunt Elsie. Such a beautiful room as it is!\" exclaimed Evelyn. \"How very kind you and Uncle Lester are to me!\"  There was a little tremble of emotion in the child's voice as she spoke.  Elsie put her arms lovingly about her. \"Dear child,\" she said, \"how could we be otherwise? We want you to feel that this is truly your own home, and to be very happy in it.\"  \"I could not be so happy with any one else as with you and uncle,\" returned the little girl, with a sigh to the memory of the father she had loved so well.  \"And to-morrow you shall see what a sweet home this is,\" Elsie said, releasing her with a kiss.  \"Now we must hasten to make ourselves ready for supper. A change of dress will not be necessary. There will be no company tonight, and your uncle would prefer seeing us in our traveling dresses to having his meal spoiled by waiting.\"  Evelyn went to sleep that night to the music of the dashing of the rain upon the windows, but woke next morning to find the sun shining brightly in a deep blue sky wherein soft, fleecy white clouds were floating.  She drew aside the window curtain to take a peep at the surroundings of her new home. Lawn, shrubbery, flower garden, while larger than those at Crag Cottage, were quite as well kept; neatness and order, beauty and fragrance made them so attractive that Evelyn was tempted to a stroll while waiting for the call to breakfast.  She stole softly down the stairs, thinking her aunt and uncle might be still sleeping, but found the latter on the veranda, pacing to and fro with meditative air.  \"Ah, good morning, little maid!\" he said in a kindly tone. \"I hope you slept well and feel refreshed?\"  \"Yes, uncle, thank you,\" she returned. \"Don't you enjoy being at home again after your long absence?\"  \"I do, indeed!\" he answered; \"there is no place like home, is there? This is your home, too, now, Eva.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" a little sadly. \"You and Aunt Elsie are home to me now, almost as papa used to be in the dear old days; and perhaps I shall learn to love Fairview as well as I do Crag Cottage. May I go into the garden, uncle?\"  \"Yes, I will take you with pleasure. Your shoes are thick I see,\" glancing down at them, \"and that is well; for the walks may be a little damp.\"  He led her about, calling her attention to one and another rare plant or flower in garden and green-house, and gathering a bouquet of beautiful and fragrant blossoms for her, then one for his wife.  Elsie joined them on the veranda as they came in at the summons to breakfast, and Lester presented his flowers, claiming a kiss in return.  \"Help yourself,\" she said laughingly; \"and many thanks for your flowers. And now shall we go in to breakfast? we are a little late this morning.\"  \"Ah, our mail is already here, I see,\" Lester remarked, as they entered the breakfast-room. \"I will open the bag while you pour the coffee, my dear, hoping to find a letter for each of us.\"  \"I think there should be one for me,\" remarked Evelyn, watching her uncle with wistful, longing eyes as he took out the letters and glanced over the addresses; \"for I have heard but once from mamma since she went away.\"  \"Twice now,\" her uncle said with a pleased smile, as he handed her the longed-for missive.  \"You, too, hear from your mother this morning, my dear; and from several other friends. Here, Jane,\" to the servant girl in waiting, \"hand these to your mistress.\"  \"And here is a cup of coffee to reward you; mamma's letter alone is worth it,\" responded Elsie gaily, lifting the letters from the silver waiter on which they lay, and setting there, in their stead, a delicate china cup from whose steaming contents a delicious aroma greeted the nostrils.  \"I must just peep into mamma's to see when we may expect them home,\" she added, breaking open its envelope; \"the rest will keep till after breakfast.\"  \"When was Aunt Wealthy's birthday?\" queried her husband.  \"Yesterday,\" she answered with her eyes on the letter. \"Ah! Ned and Zoe start this morning for home. The rest will stay a week or so longer, and our cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Keith, and their daughter, Annis, will soon follow with the expectation of spending the winter as mamma's guests.\"  \"Will you excuse me, Aunt Elsie, if I open my letter now just for a peep?\" asked Evelyn with a slight shy smile.  \"No, my dear, certainly not; as I never do the like myself, but always wait patiently till the meal is over,\" returned the young aunt with playful irony.  \"Then I'll have to ask uncle or do it without permission,\" said Evelyn, blushing and laughing.  \"Hark to the answer coming from the chicken yard,\" said her uncle facetiously, as the loud crow of a cock broke in upon their talk.  \"I fail to catch your meaning, uncle,\" said Evelyn, with another blush and smile.  \"Listen!\" he answered, \"he will speak again presently, and tell me if he doesn't say, 'Mistress rules here.' Some one has so interpreted it, and, I think, correctly.  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Evelyn, laughing; \"then, of course, it is of no use to appeal from auntie's decisions.\"  \"No, even I generally do as I am bid,\" he remarked gravely.  \"And I almost always,\" said Elsie. \"Eva, would you like to drive over to Ion with me this morning?\"  \"Very much indeed, Aunt Elsie,\" was the prompt and pleased reply.  \"Mamma wishes me to carry the news of the expected arrival of my brother and his wife, and to see that all is in order for their reception,\" Elsie went on.  \"And am I to be entirely neglected in your invitation?\" asked her husband, in a tone of deep pretended disappointment and chagrin.  \"Your company will be most acceptable, Mr. Leland, if you will favor us with it,\" was the gay rejoinder. \"Baby shall go, too; an airing will do him good; and beside, mammy will want to see him.\"  \"Of course; for she looks upon him as a sort of great-grand child, does she not?\" said Lester.  \"Either that or great-great,\" returned Elsie lightly.  \"Who is mammy?\" asked Evelyn.  \"Mamma's old nurse, who had the care of her from her birth--indeed, and of her mother also--and has nursed each one of us in turn. Of course, we are all devotedly attached to her and she to us. Aunt Chloe is what she is called by those who are not her nurslings.\"  \"She must be very, very old, I should think,\" observed Evelyn.  \"She is,\" said Elsie, and very infirm. No one knows her exact age, but she cannot be much, if any younger than Aunt Wealthy, who has just passed her hundredth birthday; and I believe her to be, in fact, somewhat older.\"  \"How I should like to see her!\" exclaimed Evelyn.  \"I hope to give you that pleasure to-day,\" responded Elsie. \"Until very recently she always accompanied mamma--no, I mistake; she staid behind once; it was when Lilly was taken North as a last hope of saving her dear life. Papa and mamma thought best to take me and the baby along, and to leave mammy behind in charge of the other children.  \"This summer she was too feeble to leave Ion; so we shall find her there. In deep sorrow too, no doubt; for her old husband, Uncle Joe, died a few weeks since.\"  \"Eva must hear their story one of these days,\" remarked Mr. Leland; \"it is very interesting.\"  \"Yes; and some of it very sad; that which occurred before mamma's visit to Viamede, after she had attained her majority. That visit was the dawn of brighter days to them. I will tell you the whole story, Eva, some time when we are sitting quietly together at our needlework, if you will remind me.\"  \"For what hour will you have the carriage ordered, my dear?\" Lester asked, as they left the table. \"Ten, if you please,\" she answered. \"I hope you will go with us?\"  \"I shall do so with pleasure,\" he said. \"It is a lovely morning for a drive; the rain has laid the dust and the air is just cool enough to be bracing.\"  Evelyn was on the veranda, gazing about her with a thoughtful air.  \"Well, lassie, what think you of Fairview?\" asked her uncle, coming to her side.  \"I like it,\" she answered emphatically. \"Didn't something happen here, uncle, in the time of the Ku-Klux raids? I seem to have heard there did.\"  \"Yes; a coffin, with a threatening notice attached, was laid at the gate yonder one night. My uncle owned, and lived on, the place at that time, and by reason of his northern birth and Republican sentiments, was obnoxious to the members of the klan.\"  \"And it was he they were threatening?\"  \"Yes. They afterward attacked the place, wounded and drove him into the woods, but were held at bay and finally driven off by the gallant defence of her home made by my aunt, assisted by her son, then quite a young boy.  \"But get Elsie to tell you the story; she can do it far better than I; especially as she was living at Ion at that time, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13388"],["title","The Religious Spirit of the Slavs (#0)"],["body","Europe.

FATHER NICOLAI VELIMIROVIC  _Priest of the Serbian Church, and Professor of Theology in the University of Belgrade_  I. SLAV ORTHODOXY II. SLAV REVOLUTIONARY CATHOLICISM III. THE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT OF THE SLAVS   1916       I  SLAV ORTHODOXY  The Holy Synod and Tolstoi.   When Count Tolstoi was excommunicated by the Holy Synod of Russia because \"he preached the teachings which are contrary to the Christian faith,\" the world was divided in opinion and sympathy into two parts. The partisans of Tolstoi were in the majority in the Western world; those of the Holy Synod in Russia and the Orthodox East. Yet Holy Russia rejected Tolstoi with much more compassion than Western Europe approved of him. It was a human tragedy which is not often repeated in history and was understood only by Russia. The conflict was more stern than appeared on the surface. The problems in question meant not less than the dilemma: either the Christian world was to continue or it must return to the starting point of human history and begin all anew. A little blade of grass in the field said to its green neighbours: \"Why do we grow up? It is nonsense and pain. In growing up we grow in complications, which enhance the darkness and pain of our lives. I propose, therefore, to go back into seeds, from which we have grown big and unhappy.\"  So spoke one blade of grass to the field. And the field replied: \"Although perhaps we are growing in nonsense and pain, still we cannot return, we must grow and go our way in the belief that we are not mistaken.\"  That is the simile of Tolstoi and the Holy Synod.   A Circle or a Drama.  Tolstoi perceived life as a circle, with the beginning everywhere and with the end everywhere. The Holy Synod, representing Slav Orthodoxy, perceived life as a drama with a beginning and an end in space and time. From his point of view, Tolstoi thought it possible for mankind to stop a mistaken course of things and to begin anew, to cast away all the burdens of culture, of State, Church, militarism, worldly ambitions, the vanities of towns, to draw the curtain on the past and to come back to the field and forest, to plough and sow, to listen to the life of Nature and to live with Nature and God in unison.  The Holy Synod, from their point of view, thought that the past is the very foundation of the present and future, and that in separating us from the past we were as an uprooted plant, condemned to inevitable death, while in continuing the world-drama we are going the only possible way. The beginning of sin in this drama is in Adam, the beginning of salvation is in Christ. We cannot live without taking notice even of the life of Adam and without connecting our life with Christ's. And all the other millions of human beings between those two milestones, between Adam and Christ, and Christ and us, are greater or smaller foundations, or conditions, or even disturbances of our own life.  \"My understanding is against your traditions,\" said Tolstoi.  \"Our traditions are against your understandings,\" replied the Holy Synod.  But that was not all.  The difference existed also in views on    HAPPINESS AND ATONEMENT.   Tolstoi was much troubled by the suffering of men. He himself saw, felt and described an immense amount of this suffering in various forms. The problem of happiness was his most cherished problem. He believed that men can be made happy in this life, and even more--that they are created in order to be happy. He refused quite definitely the idea of atonement as inconceivable and contrary to the idea of God. Human life has been normal and happy as long as men lived their simple life without towns and without all urban complications. Life can again be made a normal and happy one as God wills, if we only return to the primitive simplicity of the peasants.  The Holy Synod was not opposed to the happiness of men, but they did not believe either that happiness is attainable in this world or that it is the aim of our life on earth. Did it not occur quite in the beginning of the world's history that there lived on earth two brothers, Cain and Abel, two farmers, without any burden of culture, and with all the Tolstoian simplicity of life? Yet is it not reported that one killed the other?  Life is a drama, a tragic drama even, and not at all a metaphysical immobility or a quasi-mobility, or even an eternal _circulus viciosus_. There are three stages of human life: the first stage before the sin, in God-like _naïveté_, the second in sin, and the third after the atonement, life in perfection, when there will be \"a new earth and a new heaven.\" We are in the middle stage, where life means sin and atonement, therefore in the most tragic stage. Life in the first and third stages may consist entirely in contemplation, but the life which we are actually living consists of deeds, of sins and virtues, _i.e._, of the struggle between good and evil, of suffering and purification, of a tragic heroism, of atonement.    DREAMS ABOUT THE REALITY.   It was not until the decline of the glorious Byzantine Empire that the Slavs embraced Christianity. For nine hundred years the Greeks were the principal representatives, protectors, elaborators and explorers of Christianity. When the Greeks visited the Slav country with their divine message, the Slavs were heathens. Their heathenism was like a confusing dream. Nature stood before them with its contradictory forces. The primitive Slavs regarded all the forces of Nature encircling a human creature as being alive and stronger than this creature. All the forces, whether friendly or unfriendly to man, are man like, anthropomorphic, and none of them are indifferent to human life and doings. The practical conclusion come to was: men must give sacrifices to both of them, to the good and to the evil; to the good in order to encourage them to be more good, to the evil in order to induce them to be less evil. It was necessary to pray equally to the good as to the evil gods. The best worship was the best balance between the good and bad spirits; not to offend any of them, but to be reconciled with all of them! Skilful diplomacy was indeed needed in worshipping all the terrible, invisible representatives of the forces of Nature seemingly fighting around man and because of man. And men are too weak to take their part decisively in one or other fighting camp. Everything useful or beautiful for men was regarded as being possessed by a good god or spirit. Everything dangerous and unfriendly was considered to be possessed by an evil god or spirit. The supreme god Perun, supreme because the strongest, was considered as acting equally for good and for evil. The curious fact is that the supreme divinity in every pagan theology was imagined to be acting equally strongly for good and for evil, as Zeus Jupiter, Wothan. You cannot call Zeus or Jupiter or Wothan or Perun a _good_ god, but only a _mighty_ god. With Christianity came into the world, including the Slav world, decisiveness, and every confusion disappeared. The Slavs learned to know that they could not serve two masters, but only one, and that they had not to balance between good and evil but to go straightway on the side of _good_.     Reality as a Dream.   The Byzantine Emperors promised to the Serbs peace and land in their Empire in the Balkans if they accepted the Christian faith. And the Serbs accepted the Christian faith. The Emperors Basil and Constantine agreed to give their sister in marriage to Vladimir, King of Kieff, if he would embrace the Christian faith. And King Vladimir embraced the Christian faith. These may be considered very petty motives! Yet this was not the price to tie the mighty idol Perun on a horse's tail and to carry him into the water of Dnieper. The principal motive was the striking reality of the Christian foundation. The Christian message was like a dream (\"We have been in Heaven,\" reported the Russian delegates, returning from Saint Sophia)--the Slavs loved dreams and poetry very much; but the Christian faith was stated to be a reality, and the Slavs, as men the world over, considered reality as more solid than any dream. Instead of a nightmare of youthful dreams, as the Slav pagan theology was, came now a bright poetry warranted both as a _past_ and _present_ reality.  It will remain as the greatest wonder in history how a poor Man, who preached in Palestine for about two years, who scarcely had a hundred followers at the end of His mission, who was crucified and died a shameful death, whose cause seemed a quite desperate episode, scornfully rejected or fearfully abandoned by all those who knew it--how this poor Man replaced successively the mightiest gods the human imagination ever invented: Zeus in Olympus, Jupiter in the Capitol, Wothan in the North, and at last also Perun in Kieff. The secret lies, I think, in the reality of His human life, in the mystery of His resurrection, and in the amazing enthusiasm with which thousands of His followers afterwards suffered death for Him and His cause.  However, Christ entered the Slav world in an epoch when, not only one man after another bowed before Him, but nation after nation. He came to our ancestors no more as a humble preacher, but as a Lord, under whose feet lay already conquered Zeus, Jupiter and Wothan. He came to us, not from a poor Bethlehem cottage, but from the most brilliant temple upon earth, from the Saint Sophia in Constantinople. He came with a wonderful three-fold mission, to serve, to fight, to reigning one word, to be \"all in all.\" He entered the Roman world as a humble servant. I am afraid He remained in this world for ever only as a servant. But He entered the Slav world as a Lord, and until to-d"]]]
