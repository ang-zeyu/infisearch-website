No after-influence can ever compensate for mistakes made at this time.[9]  What is true of alcohol is equally true of other potent drugs and poisons, which should all be avoided so far as possible during pregnancy because of the harmful influence they may directly exert on the embryo. Hygiene is better than drugs, and care should be exercised in diet, which should by no means be excessive. It is a mistake to suppose that the pregnant woman needs considerably more food than usual, and there is much reason to believe not only that a rich meat diet tends to cause sterility but that it is also unfavorable to the development of the child in the womb.[10]  How far, if at all, it is often asked, should sexual intercourse be continued after fecundation has been clearly ascertained? This has not always been found an easy question to answer, for in the human couple many considerations combine to complicate the answer. Even the Catholic theologians have not been entirely in agreement on this point. Clement of Alexandria said that when the seed had been sown the field must be left till harvest. But it may be concluded that, as a rule, the Church was inclined to regard intercourse during pregnancy as at most a venial sin, provided there was no danger of abortion. Augustine, Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Dens, for instance, seem to be of this mind; for a few, indeed, it is no sin at all.[11] Among animals the rule is simple and uniform; as soon as the female is impregnated at the period of oestrus she absolutely rejects all advance of the male until, after birth and lactation are over, another period of oestrus occurs. Among savages the tendency is less uniform, and sexual abstinence, when it occurs during pregnancy, tends to become less a natural instinct than a ritual observance, or a custom now chiefly supported by superstitions. Among many primitive peoples abstinence during the whole of pregnancy is enjoined because it is believed that the semen would kill the foetus.[12]      The Talmud is unfavorable to coitus during pregnancy, and the     Koran prohibits it during the whole of the period, as well as     during suckling. Among the Hindus, on the other hand, intercourse     is continued up to the last fortnight of pregnancy, and it is     even believed that the injected semen helps to nourish the embryo     (W.D. Sutherland, \"Ueber das Alltagsleben und die Volksmedizin     unter den Bauern Britischostindiens,\" _Münchener Medizinische     Wochenschrift_, Nos. 12 and 13, 1906). The great Indian physician     Susruta, however, was opposed to coitus during pregnancy, and the     Chinese are emphatically on the same side.  As men have emerged from barbarism in the direction of civilization, the animal instinct of refusal after impregnation has been completely lost in women, while at the same time both sexes tend to become indifferent to those ritual restraints which at an earlier period were almost as binding as instinct. Sexual intercourse thus came to be practiced after impregnation, much the same as before, as part of ordinary \"marital rights,\" though sometimes there has remained a faint suspicion, reflected in the hesitating attitude of the Catholic Church already alluded to, that such intercourse may be a sinful indulgence. Morality is, however, called in to fortify this indulgence. If the husband is shut out from marital intercourse at this time, it is argued, he will seek extra-marital intercourse, as indeed in some parts of the world it is recognized that he legitimately may; therefore the interests of the wife, anxious to retain her husband's fidelity, and the interests of Christian morality, anxious to uphold the institution of monogamy, combine to permit the continuation of coitus during pregnancy. The custom has been furthered by the fact that, in civilized women at all events, coitus during pregnancy is usually not less agreeable than at other times and by some women is felt indeed to be even more agreeable.[13] There is also the further consideration, for those couples who have sought to prevent conception, that now intercourse may be enjoyed with impunity. From a higher point of view such intercourse may also be justified, for if, as all the finer moralists of the sexual impulse now believe, love has its value not only in so far as it induces procreation but also in so far as it aids individual development and the mutual good and harmony of the united couple, it becomes morally right during pregnancy.  From an early period, however, great authorities have declared themselves in opposition to the custom of practicing coitus during pregnancy. At the end of the first century, Soranus, the first of great gynæcologists, stated, in his treatise on the diseases of women, that sexual intercourse is injurious throughout pregnancy, because of the movement imparted to the uterus, and especially injurious during the latter months. For more than sixteen hundred years the question, having fallen into the hands of the theologians, seems to have been neglected on the medical side until in 1721 a distinguished French obstetrician, Mauriceau, stated that no pregnant woman should have intercourse during the last two months and that no woman subject to miscarriage should have intercourse at all during pregnancy. For more than a century, however, Mauriceau remained a pioneer with few or no followers. It would be inconvenient, the opinion went, even if it were necessary, to forbid intercourse during pregnancy.[14]  During recent years, nevertheless, there has been an increasingly strong tendency among obstetricians to speak decisively concerning intercourse during pregnancy, either by condemning it altogether or by enjoining great prudence. It is highly probable that, in accordance with the classical experiments of Dareste on chicken embryos, shocks and disturbances to the human embryo may also produce injurious effects on growth. The disturbance due to coitus in the early stages of pregnancy may thus tend to produce malformation. When such conditions are found in the children of perfectly healthy, vigorous, and generally temperate parents who have indulged recklessly in coitus during the early stages of pregnancy it is possible that such coitus has acted on the embryo in the same way as shocks and intoxications are known to act on the embryo of lower organisms. However this may be, it is quite certain that in predisposed women, coitus during pregnancy causes premature birth; it sometimes happens that labor pains begin a few minutes after the act.[15] The natural instinct of animals refuses to allow intercourse during pregnancy; the ritual observance of primitive peoples very frequently points in the same direction; the voice of medical science, so far as it speaks at all, is beginning to utter the same warning, and before long will probably be in a position to do so on the basis of more solid and coherent evidence.      Pinard, the greatest of authorities on puericulture, asserts that     there must be complete cessation of sexual intercourse during the     whole of pregnancy, and in his consulting room at the Clinique     Baudelocque he has placed a large placard with an \"Important     Notice\" to this effect. Féré was strongly of opinion that sexual     relations during pregnancy, especially when recklessly carried     out, play an important part in the causation of nervous troubles     in children who are of sound heredity and otherwise free from all     morbid infection during gestation and development; he recorded in     detail a case which he considered conclusive (\"L'Influence de     l'Incontinence Sexuelle pendant la Gestation sur la Descendance,\"     _Archives de Neurologie_, April, 1905). Bouchacourt discusses the     subject fully (_La Grossesse_, pp. 177-214), and thinks that     sexual intercourse during pregnancy should be avoided as much as     possible. Fürbringer (Senator and Kaminer, _Health and Disease in     Relation to Marriage_, vol. i, p. 226) recommends abstinence from     the sixth or seventh month, and throughout the whole of pregnancy     where there is any tendency to miscarriage, while in all cases     much care and gentleness should be exercised.      The whole subject has been investigated in a Paris Thesis by H.     Brénot (_De L'Influence de la Copulation pendant la Grossesse_,     1903); he concludes that sexual relations are dangerous     throughout pregnancy, frequently provoking premature confinement     or abortion, and that they are more dangerous in primiparæ than     in multiparæ.  Nearly everything that has been said of the hygiene of pregnancy, and the need for rest, applies also to the period immediately following the birth of the child. Rest and hygiene on the mother's part continue to be necessary alike in her own interests and in the child's. This need has indeed been more generally and more practically recognized than the need for rest during pregnancy. The laws of several countries make compulsory a period of rest from employment after confinement, and in some countries they seek to provide for the remuneration of the mother during this enforced rest. In no country, indeed, is the principle carried out so thoroughly and for so long a period as is desirable. But it is the right principle, and embodies the germ which, in the future, will be developed. There can be little doubt that whatever are the matters, and they are certainly many, which may be safely left to the discretion of the individual, the care of the mother and her child is not among them. That is a matter which, more than any other, concerns the community as a whole, and the community cannot afford to be slack in asserting its authority over it. The State needs healthy men and women, and by any negligence in attending to this need it inflicts serious charges of all sorts upon itself, and at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#7)"],["body","same time dangerously impairs its efficiency in the world. Nations have begun to recognize the desirability of education, but they have scarcely yet begun to realize that the nationalization of health is even more important than the nationalization of education. If it were necessary to choose between the task of getting children educated and the task of getting them well-born and healthy it would be better to abandon education. There have been many great peoples who never dreamed of national systems of education; there has been no great people without the art of producing healthy and vigorous children.  This matter becomes of peculiar importance in great industrial states like England, the United States, and Germany, because in such states a tacit conspiracy tends to grow up to subordinate national ends to individual ends, and practically to work for the deterioration of the race. In England, for instance, this tendency has become peculiarly well marked with disastrous results. The interest of the employed woman tends to become one with that of her employer; between them they combine to crush the interests of the child who represents the race, and to defeat the laws made in the interests of the race which are those of the community as a whole. The employed woman wishes to earn as much wages as she can and with as little interruption as she can; in gratifying that wish she is, at the same time, acting in the interests of the employer, who carefully avoids thwarting her.  This impulse on the employed woman's part is by no means always and entirely the result of poverty, and would not, therefore, be removed by raising her wages. Long before marriage, when little more than a child, she has usually gone out to work, and work has become a second nature. She has mastered her work, she enjoys a certain position and what to her are high wages; she is among her friends and companions; the noise and bustle and excitement of the work-room or the factory have become an agreeable stimulant which she can no longer do without. On the other hand, her home means nothing to her; she only returns there to sleep, leaving it next morning at day-break or earlier; she is ignorant even of the simplest domestic arts; she moves about in her own home like a strange and awkward child. The mere act of marriage cannot change this state of things; however willing she may be at marriage to become a domesticated wife, she is destitute alike of the inclination or the skill for domesticity. Even in spite of herself she is driven back to the work-shop, to the one place where she feels really at home.      In Germany women are not allowed to work for four weeks after     confinement, nor during the following two weeks except by medical     certificate. The obligatory insurance against disease which     covers women at confinement assures them an indemnity at this     time equivalent to a large part of their wages. Married and     unmarried mothers benefit alike. The Austrian law is founded on     the same model. This measure has led to a very great decrease in     infantile mortality, and, therefore, a great increase in health     among those who survive. It is, however, regarded as very     inadequate, and there is a movement in Germany for extending the     time, for applying the system to a larger number of women, and     for making it still more definitely compulsory.      In Switzerland it has been illegal since 1877 for any woman to be     received into a factory after confinement, unless she has rested     in all for eight weeks, six weeks at least of this period being     after confinement. Since 1898 Swiss working women have been     protected by law from exercising hard work during pregnancy, and     from various other influences likely to be injurious. But this     law is evaded in practice, because it provides no compensatory     indemnity for the woman. An attempt, in 1899, to amend the law by     providing for such indemnity was rejected by the people.      In Belgium and Holland there are laws against women working     immediately after confinement, but no indemnity is provided, so     that employers and employed combine to evade the law. In France     there is no such law, although its necessity has often been     emphatically asserted (see, e.g., Salvat, _La Dépopulation de la     France_, Thèse de Lyon, 1903).      In England it is illegal to employ a woman \"knowingly\" in a     work-shop within four weeks of the birth of her child, but no     provision is made by the law for the compensation of the woman     who is thus required to sacrifice herself to the interests of the     State. The woman evades the law in tacit collusion with her     employers, who can always avoid \"knowing\" that a birth has taken     place, and so escape all responsibility for the mother's     employment. Thus the factory inspectors are unable to take     action, and the law becomes a dead letter; in 1906 only one     prosecution for this offense could be brought into court. By the     insertion of this \"knowingly\" a premium is placed on ignorance.     The unwisdom of thus beforehand placing a premium on ignorance     has always been more or less clearly recognized by the framers of     legal codes even as far back as the days of the Ten Commandments     and the laws of Hamurabi. It is the business of the Court, of     those who administer the law, to make allowance for ignorance     where such allowance is fairly called for; it is not for the     law-maker to make smooth the path of the law-breaker. There are     evidently law-makers nowadays so scrupulous, or so simple-minded,     that they would be prepared to exact that no pickpocket should be     prosecuted if he was able to declare on oath that he had no     \"knowledge\" that the purse he had taken belonged to the person he     extracted it from.      The annual reports of the English factory inspectors serve to     bring ridicule on this law, which looks so wisely humane and yet     means nothing, but have so far been powerless to effect any     change. These reports show, moreover, that the difficulty is     increasing in magnitude. Thus Miss Martindale, a factory     inspector, states that in all the towns she visits, from a quiet     cathedral city to a large manufacturing town, the employment of     married women is rapidly increasing; they have worked in mills or     factories all their lives and are quite unaccustomed to cooking,     housework and the rearing of children, so that after marriage,     even when not compelled by poverty, they prefer to go on working     as before. Miss Vines, another factory inspector, repeats the     remark of a woman worker in a factory. \"I do not need to work,     but I do not like staying at home,\" while another woman said, \"I     would rather be at work a hundred times than at home. I get lost     at home\" (_Annual Report Chief Inspector of Factories and     Workshops for 1906_, pp. 325, etc.).      It may be added that not only is the English law enjoining four     weeks' rest on the mother after childbirth practically     inoperative, but the period itself is absurdly inadequate. As a     rest for the mother it is indeed sufficient, but the State is     still more interested in the child than in its mother, and the     child needs the mother's chief care for a much longer period than     four weeks. Helme advocates the State prohibition of women's work     for at least six months after confinement. Where nurseries are     attached to factories, enabling the mother to suckle her infant     in intervals of work, the period may doubtless be shortened.      It is important to remember that it is by no means only the women     in factories who are induced to work as usual during the whole     period of pregnancy, and to return to work immediately after the     brief rest of confinement. The Research Committee of the     Christian Social Union (London Branch) undertook, in 1905, an     inquiry into the employment of women after childbirth. Women in     factories and workshops were excluded from the inquiry which only     had reference to women engaged in household duties, in home     industries, and in casual work. It was found that the majority     carry on their employment right up to the time of confinement and     resume it from ten to fourteen days later. The infantile death     rate for the children of women engaged only in household duties     was greatly lower than that for the children of the other women,     while, as ever, the hand-fed infants had a vastly higher death     rate than the breast-fed infants (_British Medical Journal_, Oct.     24, 1908, p. 1297).      In the great French gun and armour-plate works at Creuzot (Saône     et Loire) the salaries of expectant mothers among the employees     are raised; arrangements are made for giving them proper advice     and medical attendance; they are not allowed to work after the     middle of pregnancy or to return to work after confinement     without a medical certificate of fitness. The results are said to     be excellent, not only on the health of the mothers, but in the     diminution of premature births, the decrease of infantile deaths,     and the general prevalence of breast-feeding. It would probably     be hopeless to expect many employers in Anglo-Saxon lands to     adopt this policy. They are too \"practical,\" they know how small     is the money-value of human lives. With us it is necessary for     the State to intervene.      There can be no doubt that, on the whole, modern civilized     communities are beginning to realize that under the social and     economic conditions now tending more and more to prevail, they     must in their own interests insure that the mother's best energy     and vitality are devoted to the child, both before and after its     birth. They are also realizing that they cannot carry out their     duty in this respect unless they make adequate provision for"]]]
