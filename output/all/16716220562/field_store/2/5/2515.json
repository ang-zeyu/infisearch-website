And you mustn’t be frightened at the distance. We think nothing of long distances here—we have so much to think about and feel. Time goes all too quickly.”  During their conversation they had drawn near the base of the hills, which sloped gently, and were not above fifty feet in height. Maskull now began to see strange specimens of vegetable life. What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was moving across the sand in their direction. When it came near enough he perceived that it was not grass; there were no blades, but only purple roots. The roots were revolving, for each small plant in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless wheel. They were alternately plunged in the sand, and withdrawn from it, and by this means the plant proceeded forward. Some uncanny, semi-intelligent instinct was keeping all the plants together, moving at one pace, in one direction, like a flock of migrating birds in flight.  Another remarkable plant was a large, feathery ball, resembling a dandelion fruit, which they encountered sailing through the air. Joiwind caught it with an exceedingly graceful movement of her arm, and showed it to Maskull. It had roots and presumably lived in the air and fed on the chemical constituents of the atmosphere. But what was peculiar about it was its colour. It was an entirely new colour—not a new shade or combination, but a new primary colour, as vivid as blue, red, or yellow, but quite different. When he inquired, she told him that it was known as “ulfire.” Presently he met with a second new colour. This she designated “jale.” The sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy. Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.  The hills were composed of a rich, dark mould. Small trees, of weird shapes, all differing from each other, but all purple-coloured, covered the slopes and top. Maskull and Joiwind climbed up and through. Some hard fruit, bright blue in colour, of the size of a large apple, and shaped like an egg, was lying in profusion underneath the trees.  “Is the fruit here poisonous, or why don’t you eat it?” asked Maskull.  She looked at him tranquilly. “We don’t eat living things. The thought is horrible to us.”  “I have nothing to say against that, theoretically. But do you really sustain your bodies on water?”  “Supposing you could find nothing else to live on, Maskull—would you eat other men?”  “I would not.”  “Neither will we eat plants and animals, which are our fellow creatures. So nothing is left to us but water, and as one can really live on anything, water does very well.”  Maskull picked up one of the fruits and handled it curiously. As he did so another of his newly acquired sense organs came into action. He found that the fleshy knobs beneath his ears were in some novel fashion acquainting him with the inward properties of the fruit. He could not only see, feel, and smell it, but could detect its intrinsic nature. This nature was hard, persistent and melancholy.  Joiwind answered the questions he had not asked.  “Those organs are called ‘poigns.’ Their use is to enable us to understand and sympathise with all living creatures.”  “What advantage do you derive from that, Joiwind?”  “The advantage of not being cruel and selfish, dear Maskull.”  He threw the fruit away and flushed again.  Joiwind looked into his swarthy, bearded face without embarrassment and slowly smiled. “Have I said too much? Have I been too familiar? Do you know why you think so? It’s because you are still impure. By and by you will listen to all language without shame.”  Before he realised what she was about to do, she threw her tentacle round his neck, like another arm. He offered no resistance to its cool pressure. The contact of her soft flesh with his own was so moist and sensitive that it resembled another kind of kiss. He saw who it was that embraced him—a pale, beautiful girl. Yet, oddly enough, he experienced neither voluptuousness nor sexual pride. The love expressed by the caress was rich, glowing, and personal, but there was not the least trace of sex in it—and so he received it.  She removed her tentacle, placed her two arms on his shoulders and penetrated with her eyes right into his very soul.  “Yes, I wish to be pure,” he muttered. “Without that what can I ever be but a weak, squirming devil?”  Joiwind released him. “This we call the ‘magn,’” she said, indicating her tentacle. “By means of it what we love already we love more, and what we don’t love at all we begin to love.”  “A godlike organ!”  “It is the one we guard most jealously,” said Joiwind.  The shade of the trees afforded a timely screen from the now almost insufferable rays of Branchspell, which was climbing steadily upward to the zenith. On descending the other side of the little hills, Maskull looked anxiously for traces of Nightspore and Krag, but without result. After staring about him for a few minutes he shrugged his shoulders; but suspicions had already begun to gather in his mind.  A small, natural amphitheatre lay at their feet, completely circled by the tree-clad heights. The centre was of red sand. In the very middle shot up a tall, stately tree, with a black trunk and branches, and transparent, crystal leaves. At the foot of this tree was a natural, circular well, containing dark green water.  When they had reached the bottom, Joiwind took him straight over to the well.  Maskull gazed at it intently. “Is this the shrine you talked about?”  “Yes. It is called Shaping’s Well. The man or woman who wishes to invoke Shaping must take up some of the gnawl water, and drink it.”  “Pray for me,” said Maskull. “Your unspotted prayer will carry more weight.”  “What do you wish for?”  “For purity,” answered Maskull, in a troubled voice.  Joiwind made a cup of her hand, and drank a little of the water. She held it up to Maskull’s mouth. “You must drink too.” He obeyed. She then stood erect, closed her eyes, and, in a voice like the soft murmurings of spring, prayed aloud.  “Shaping, my father, I am hoping you can hear me. A strange man has come to us weighed down with heavy blood. He wishes to be pure. Let him know the meaning of love, let him live for others. Don’t spare him pain, dear Shaping, but let him seek his own pain. Breathe into him a noble soul.”  Maskull listened with tears in his heart.  As Joiwind finished speaking, a blurred mist came over his eyes, and, half buried in the scarlet sand, appeared a large circle of dazzlingly white pillars. For some minutes they flickered to and fro between distinctness and indistinctness, like an object being focused. Then they faded out of sight again.  “Is that a sign from Shaping?” asked Maskull, in a low, awed tone.  “Perhaps it is. It is a time mirage.”  “What can that be, Joiwind?”  “You see, dear Maskull, the temple does not yet exist but it will do so, because it must. What you and I are now doing in simplicity, wise men will do hereafter in full knowledge.”  “It is right for man to pray,” said Maskull. “Good and evil in the world don’t originate from nothing. God and Devil must exist. And we should pray to the one, and fight the other.”  “Yes, we must fight Krag.”  “What name did you say?” asked Maskull in amazement.  “Krag—the author of evil and misery—whom you call Devil.”  He immediately concealed his thoughts. To prevent Joiwind from learning his relationship to this being, he made his mind a blank.  “Why do you hide your mind from me?” she demanded, looking at him strangely and changing colour.  “In this bright, pure, radiant world, evil seems so remote, one can scarcely grasp its meaning.” But he lied.  Joiwind continued gazing at him, straight out of her clean soul. “The world is good and pure, but many men are corrupt. Panawe, my husband, has travelled, and he has told me things I would almost rather have not heard. One person he met believed the universe to be, from top to bottom, a conjurer’s cave.”  “I should like to meet your husband.”  “Well, we are going home now.”  Maskull was on the point of inquiring whether she had any children, but was afraid of offending her, and checked himself.  She read the mental question. “What need is there? Is not the whole world full of lovely children? Why should I want selfish possessions?”  An extraordinary creature flew past, uttering a plaintive cry of five distinct notes. It was not a bird, but had a balloon-shaped body, paddled by five webbed feet. It disappeared among the trees.  Joiwind pointed to it, as it went by. “I love that beast, grotesque as it is—perhaps all the more for its grotesqueness. But if I had children of my own, would I still love it? Which is best—to love two or three, or to love all?”  “Every woman can’t be like you, Joiwind, but it is good to have a few like you. Wouldn’t it be as well,” he went on, “since we’ve got to walk through that sun-baked wilderness, to make turbans for our heads out of some of those long leaves?”  She smiled rather pathetically. “You will think me foolish, but every tearing off of a leaf would be a wound in my heart. We have only to throw our robes over our heads.”  “No doubt that will answer the same purpose, but tell me—weren’t these very robes once part of a living creature?”  “Oh, no—no, they are the webs of a certain animal, but they have never been in themselves alive.”  “You reduce life to extreme simplicity,” remarked Maskull meditatively, “but it is very beautiful.”  Climbing back over the hills, they now without further ceremony began their march across the desert.  They walked side by side. Joiwind directed their course straight toward Poolingdred. From the position of the sun, Maskull judged their way to lie due north. The sand was soft and powdery, very tiring to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13290"],["title","Martin Rattler (#0)"],["body","Team.                                    MARTIN RATTLER                              BY R M BALLANTYNE                                    1858     EDITOR'S NOTE   \"MARTIN RATTLER\" was one of, Robert Michael Ballantyne's early books. Born at Edinburgh in 1825,[1] he was sent to Rupert's Land as a trading-clerk in the Hudson Bay Fur Company's service when he left school, a boy of sixteen. There, to relieve his home-sickness, he first practised his pen in long letters home to his mother. Soon after his return to Scotland in 1848 he published a first book on Hudson's Bay. Then he passed some years in a Scottish publisher's office; and in 1855 a chance suggestion from another publisher led to his writing his first book for boys--\"Snowflakes and Sunbeams, or The Young Fur Traders.\" That story showed he had found his vocation, and he poured forth its successors to the tune in all of some fourscore volumes. \"Martin Rattler\" appeared in 1858. In his \"Personal Reminiscences\" Ballantyne wrote: \"How many thousands of lads have an intense liking for the idea of a sailor's life!\" and he pointed out there the other side of the romantic picture: the long watches \"in dirty unromantic weather,\" and the hard work of holystoning the decks, scraping down the masts and cleaning out the coal-hole. But though his books show something of this reverse side too, there is no doubt they have helped to set many boys dreaming of  \"Wrecks, buccaneers, black flags, and desert lands On which, alone, the second Crusoe stands.\"  [Footnote 1: See Note to \"The Coral Island\" in this series.]  Among these persuasions to the life of adventure \"Martin Rattler\" is still one of the favourite among all his books. Ballantyne himself was fated to die on foreign soil in 1894, at Rome, where he lies buried in the English Protestant cemetery.  The following is a list of Ballantyne's chief romances, tales of adventure, and descriptive works:--  \"Hudson's Bay, or Every-day Life in the Wilds of North America,\" etc., 1848; \"Snowflakes and Sunbeams, or the Young Fur Traders,\" 1856.

Ballantyne's Miscellany was started in 1863.     MY DEAR YOUNG READERS,  In presenting this book to you I have only to repeat what I have said in the prefaces of my former works,--namely, that all the important points and anecdotes are true; only the minor and unimportant ones being mingled with fiction. With this single remark I commit my work to your hands, and wish you a pleasant ramble, in spirit, through the romantic forests of Brazil.  Yours affectionately,  R.M. BALLANTYNE.  [October, 1858.]     MARTIN RATTLER     CHAPTER I  THE HERO AND HIS ONLY RELATIVE   Martin Rattler was a very bad boy. At least his aunt, Mrs. Dorothy Grumbit, said so; and certainly she ought to have known, if anybody should, for Martin lived with her, and was, as she herself expressed it, \"the bane of her existence,--the very torment of her life.\" No doubt of it whatever, according to Aunt Dorothy Grumbit's showing, Martin Rattler was \"a remarkably bad boy.\"  It is a curious fact, however, that, although most of the people in the village of Ashford seemed to agree with Mrs. Grumbit in her opinion of Martin, there were very few of them who did not smile cheerfully on the child when they met him, and say, \"Good day, lad!\" as heartily as if they thought him the best boy in the place. No one seemed to bear Martin Rattler ill-will, notwithstanding his alleged badness. Men laughed when they said he was a bad boy, as if they did not quite believe their own assertion. The vicar, an old whiteheaded man, with a kind, hearty countenance, said that the child was full of mischief, full of mischief; but he would improve as he grew older, he was quite certain of that. And the vicar was a good judge, for he had five boys of his own, besides three other boys, the sons of a distant relative, who boarded with him; and he had lived forty years in a parish overflowing with boys, and he was particularly fond of boys in general. Not so the doctor, a pursy little man with a terrific frown, who hated boys, especially little ones, with a very powerful hatred. The doctor said that Martin was a scamp.  And yet Martin had not the appearance of a scamp. He had fat rosy cheeks, a round rosy mouth, a straight delicately-formed nose, a firm massive chin, and a broad forehead. But the latter was seldom visible, owing to the thickly-clustering fair curls that overhung it. When asleep Martin's face was the perfection of gentle innocence. But the instant he opened his dark-brown eyes, a thousand dimples and wrinkles played over his visage, chiefly at the corners of his mouth and round his eyes; as if the spirit of fun and the spirit of mischief had got entire possession of the boy, and were determined to make the most of him. When deeply interested in anything, Martin was as grave and serious as a philosopher.  Aunt Dorothy Grumbit had a turned-up nose,--a very much turned-up nose; so much so, indeed, that it presented a front view of the nostrils! It was an aggravating nose, too for the old lady's spectacles refused to rest on any part of it except the extreme point. Mrs. Grumbit invariably placed them on the right part of her nose, and they as invariably slid down the curved slope until they were brought up by the little"]]]
