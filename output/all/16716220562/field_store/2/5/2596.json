This exercise may be performed without the use of a stick or cane, by grasping an imaginary cane, using the will to exert the pressure. The exercise is a favorite Yogi plan of stimulating the circulation by driving the arterial blood to the extremities, and drawing back the venous blood to the heart and lungs that it may take up the oxygen which has been inhaled with the air. In cases of poor circulation there is not enough blood in the lungs to absorb the increased amount of oxygen inhaled, and the system does not get the full benefit of the improved breathing.  In such cases, particularly, It Is well to practice this exercise, occasionally with the regular Complete Breathing exercise.     CHAPTER XII.   SEVEN MINOR YOGI EXERCISES.  This chapter is composed of seven minor Yogi Breathing Exercises, bearing no special names, but each distinct and separate from the others and having a different purpose in view. Each student will find several of these exercises best adapted to the special requirements of his particular case. Although we have styled these exercises \"minor exercises,\" they are quite valuable and useful, or they would not appear in this book. They give one a condensed course in \"Physical Culture\" and \"Lung Development,\" and might readily be \"padded out\" and elaborated into a small book on these subjects. They have, of course, an additional value, as Yogi Breathing forms a part of each exercise. Do not pass them by because they are marked \"minor.\" Some one or more of these exercises may be just what you need. Try them and decide for yourself.  EXERCISE I.       (1) Stand erect with hands at sides.       (2) Inhale Complete Breath.       (3) Raise the arms slowly, keeping them rigid until the      hands touch over head.       (4) Retain the breath a few minutes with hands over head.       (5) Lower hands slowly to sides, exhaling slowly at same time.       (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE II.       (1) Stand erect, with arms straight In front of you.       (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.       (3) Swing arms back as far as they will go; then back to      first position; then repeat several times, returning the      breath all the while.       (4) Exhale vigorously through mouth.       (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE III.       (1) Stand erect with arms straight In front of you,       (2) Inhale Complete Breath.       (3) Swing arms around in a circle, backward, a few times.      Then reverse a few times, retaining the breath all the      while. You may vary this by rotating them alternately like      the sails of a windmill.       (4) Exhale the breath vigorously through the mouth.       (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE IV.       (1) Lie on the floor with your face downward and palms of      hands flat upon the floor by your sides.       (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.       (3) Stiffen the body and raise yourself up by the strength      of your arms until you rest on your hands and toes       (4) Then lower yourself to original position. Repeat several      times.       (5) Exhale vigorously through your mouth.       (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE V.       (1) Stand erect with your palms against the wall.       (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.       (3) Lower the chest to the wall, resting your weight on your      hands.       (4) Then raise yourself back with the arm muscles alone,      keeping the body stiff.       (5) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.       (6) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE VI.       (1) Stand erect with arms \"akimbo,\" that is, with hands      resting around the waist and elbows standing out.       (2) Inhale Complete Breath and retain.       (3) Keep legs and hips stiff and bend well forward, as If      bowing, at the same time exhaling slowly.       (4) Return to first position and take another Complete Breath.       (5) Then bend backward, exhaling slowly.       (6) Return to first position and take a Complete Breath.       (7) Then bend sideways, exhaling slowly. (Vary by bending to      right and then to left.)       (8) Practice Cleansing Breath.  EXERCISE VII.       (1) Stand erect, or sit erect, with straight spinal column.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, but instead of inhaling in a      continuous steady stream, take a series of short, quick      \"sniffs,\" as if you were smelling aromatic salts or ammonia      and did not wish to get too strong a \"whiff.\" Do not exhale      any of these little breaths, but add one to the other until      the entire lung space Is filled.       (3) Retain for a few seconds.       (4) Exhale through the nostrils in a long, restful, sighing      breath.       (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.     CHAPTER XIII.   VIBRATION AND YOGI RHYTHMIC BREATHING  All is in vibration. From the tiniest atom to the greatest sun, everything is in a state of vibration. There is nothing in absolute rest in nature. A single atom deprived of vibration would wreck the universe. In incessant vibration the universal work is performed. Matter is being constantly played upon by energy and countless forms and numberless varieties result, and yet even the forms and varieties are not permanent. They begin to change the moment they are created, and from them are born innumerable forms, which in turn change and give rise to newer forms, and so on and on, in infinite succession. Nothing is permanent in the world of forms, and yet the great Reality is unchangeable. Forms are but appearances--they come, they go, but the Reality is eternal and unchangeable.  The atoms of the human body are in constant vibration. Unceasing changes are occurring. In a few months there is almost a complete change in the matter composing the body, and scarcely a single atom now composing your body will be found in It a few months hence. Vibration, constant vibration. Change, constant change.  In all vibration is to be found a certain rhythm. Rhythm pervades the universe. The swing of the planets around the sun; the rise and fall of the sea; the beating of the heart; the ebb and flow of the tide; all follow rhythmics laws. The rays of the sun reach us; the rain descends upon us, in obedience to the same law. All growth is but an exhibition of this law. All motion is a manifestation of the law of rhythm.  Our bodies are as much subject to rhythmic laws as is the planet in its revolution around the sun. Much of the esoteric side of the Yogi Science of Breath is based upon this known principle of nature. By falling in with the rhythm of the body, the Yogi manages to absorb a great amount of Prana, which he disposes of to bring about results desired by him. We will speak of this at greater length later on.  The body which you occupy is like a small inlet running in to the land from the sea. Although apparently subject only to its own laws, it is really subject to the ebb and flow of the tides of the ocean. The great sea of life is swelling and receding, rising and falling, and we are responding to its vibrations and rhythm. In a normal condition we receive the vibration and rhythm of the great ocean of life, and respond to it, but at times the mouth of the inlet seems choked up with debris, and we fail to receive the impulse from Mother Ocean, and inharmony manifests within us.  You have heard how a note on a violin, if sounded repeatedly and in rhythm, will start into motion vibrations which will in time destroy a bridge. The same result is true when a regiment of soldiers crosses a bridge, the order being always given to \"break step\" on such an occasion, lest the vibration bring down both bridge and regiment. These manifestations of the effect of rhythmic motion will give you an idea of the effect on the body of rhythmic breathing. The whole system catches the vibration and becomes in harmony with the will, which causes the rhythmic motion of the lungs, and while in such complete harmony will respond readily to orders from the will. With the body thus attuned, the Yogi finds no difficulty in increasing the circulation in any part of the body by an order from the will, and in the same way he can direct an increased current of nerve force to any part or organ, strengthening and stimulating it.  In the same way the Yogi by rhythmic breathing \"catches the swing,\" as it were, and is able to absorb and control a greatly increased amount of prana, which is then at the disposal of his will. He can and does use it as a vehicle for sending forth thoughts to others and for attracting to him all those whose thoughts are keyed in the same vibration. The phenomena of telepathy, thought transference, mental healing, mesmerism, etc., which subjects are creating such an interest in the Western world at the present time, but which have been known to the Yogis for centuries, can be greatly increased and augmented If the person sending forth the thoughts will do so after rhythmic breathing. Rhythmic breathing will increase the value of mental healing, magnetic healing, etc., several hundred per cent.  In rhythmic breathing the main thing to be acquired is the mental idea of rhythm. To those who know anything of music, the idea of measured counting is familiar. To others, the rhythmic step of the soldier: \"Left, right; left, right; left, right; one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four,\" will convey the idea.  The Yogi bases his rhythmic time upon a unit corresponding with the beat of his heart. The heart beat varies in different persons, but the heart beat unit of each person is the proper rhythmic standard for that particular individual in his rhythmic breathing. Ascertain your normal heart beat by placing your fingers over your pulse, and then count: \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\" etc., until the rhythm becomes firmly fixed in your mind. A little practice will fix the rhythm, so that you will be able to easily reproduce it.

ON THE KING'S HIGHWAY.    CHAPTER XIV. THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.    CHAPTER XV. AWAY TO THE FOREST.    CHAPTER I. AN ONLY SON.   Good Squire Tufton of Gablehurst lay dying. He had been ailing for many months, knowing his end to be near; and yet, as is so often the case in lingering declines, death was long in coming, so that those about him had grown used to the sight of the strong figure wasted to a shadow, and the face shadowed by the wings of the hovering messenger.  Some members of the household, indeed, had begun to cherish the hope that the master might yet recover, and be seen amongst them once more; but that hope was not shared by the patient himself, nor by the two devoted women who nursed him with tender love.  His wife and daughter were always with him, relieving each other in turn, and occasionally both yielding place to one of the many faithful servants, who were all eager to do what they could for the master they loved; but in his waking hours the squire seldom missed the best-loved faces about him. Rachel and her mother seemed to live their lives about his sick bed, soothing his weariness and pain, and striving with patient resignation to school themselves to submission to the will of God, who was about to take their loved one from them.  And yet they had kept him with them longer than once seemed possible. The bright days of summer were doubtless favourable to the patient. When he could lie with open windows, breathing the pure soft air from woodland and field, he seemed able to make a stand against the grim enemy of human nature. But the summer was now upon the wane; the golden sunshine was obscured by the first driving rains of the approaching equinox; and it seemed to those who watched at the sufferer's bedside that his life was ebbing away as slowly and as steadily as the hours of sunshine in the shortening day.  Today there was a look upon his face which caused Rachel many times to turn anxious and beseeching eyes upon her mother, and yet what she read in the expression of that worn and gentle countenance only confirmed her own impressions.  The Squire lay very still and quiet, dozing as it seemed, whilst the fire crackled cheerfully up the wide chimney, and the rain dashed ceaselessly against the windows. He had not spoken for many hours. There had come into Rachel's heart a terrible fear lest he should never speak again. The shadow on his face looked so gray; the features had taken so strange and pinched a look.  Rachel had seen death before in many humble homes, although it had, so far, not touched any of her own nearest and dearest. She had watched that creeping shadow before now, for her heart always went out to the sick and the suffering, and her feet led her to the homes of those who stood in need of tender sympathy and womanly aid. But when the shadow gathered upon the face of her own loved father, the pressure upon her heart seemed almost more than she could bear. The tears stole down her cheeks, and her eyes sought those of her mother with a glance of almost pitiful appeal.  The leech had stolen into the room, had stood beside the patient, had shaken his head, and stolen away. He knew that his skill, such as it was, could avail nothing now; it was but the question of a few hours.  All day that stupor had continued. Rachel had feared they would never hear his voice, or see the loving glance of his eyes again. She had passed the time between a study of that wasted face, and an eager and restless looking forth from the casement, as though in search of something or somebody who came not.  Often she saw servants and messengers hastening this way and that, exchanging words with each other, and starting off afresh; but the one stalwart figure, for which she gazed with aching eyes, appeared not, and often a sigh would break from her lips, whilst from time to time a tear forced its way to her eyes.  Dusk was falling now. She could no longer see across the expanse of park land which surrounded Gablehurst. She drew the curtains at last with gentle hands, and piled up the logs upon the hearth. There was a glint of something in her eyes not altogether accounted for by the tears in them. It was a sparkle which bespoke wounded sensibility--something approaching to anger.  \"O brother, brother,\" she whispered, with dry lips, \"how can you treat him so? Have you a heart? How terrible a judgment you seem to be seeking to draw down upon yourself! What will the end be like, if this is the beginning?\"  The flames leapt up with a sudden ruddy glow. The room had been dark before; now it was suddenly flooded with a brilliant palpitating light. As Rachel turned back to the bed, she saw that her father's eyes had opened. The mists of weakness no longer seemed to cloud his sight. He was looking round him with comprehension and observation.  \"Where is Tom?\"  It was the question they had been expecting all day. It was in anticipation of this that messengers had been scouring the neighbourhood in search of that young ne'er-do-well, Tom Tufton, the good Squire's unworthy son.  And yet, unworthy as he was--idle, reckless, dissipated, a source of pain and anxiety to father, mother, and sister--young Tom was beloved by the people in and about his home, albeit they all shook their heads over his follies and wildness, and wondered with bated breath what would befall Gablehurst when the young master should be lord of all.  \"Where is Tom?\" asked the Squire, in a firmer voice than they had thought to hear again.  \"Dear father, we have sent for him,\" answered Rachel soothingly; \"he will be here anon.\"  \"I would speak with Tom,\" said the Squire. \"There are things I needs must say to him ere I close my eyes for ever. Perchance I have already delayed too long. Yet I have waited and waited, hoping for signs of seriousness in one so soon to lose a parent. But seriousness and Tom have no dealings together, it would seem. God forgive us if it be any lack on our part that has made our son the wild young blade that he seems like to be!\"  A little sob broke from the mother's lips. It was the bitterest thought of all to the parents; and yet they could not see wherein they had erred. They had striven to bring up the boy well. He had had the same training as his father before him. There had been no lack of firmness, and no lack of love, but the result, as at present seen, was terrible to the father and mother.  The squire heard the stifled sound of grief, and put out his hand to clasp that of his wife.  \"Remember he is the child of many prayers,\" he said. \"We must believe that those prayers will be answered. We must have faith in God.\"  \"I will try--I will try,\" answered the poor mother; \"but oh, my husband, how shall I hope to cope with that wild spirit when you are gone?\"  It was a hard question to answer, for the Squire himself had found his son more than a match for him many a time. It was true that he had done all that man can do to protect wife and daughter from the reckless extravagance of an ungoverned nature; but he knew well that Tom was not one to see himself tamely set aside. There were difficulties ahead for these two women, and the future of his son lay like a load upon his spirit.  \"I would speak with Tom,\" he said, after a brief pause, during which Rachel administered a draught of the cordial which did most to support the failing strength of the dying man. Just at this moment the lamp of life seemed to be glowing with fresh strength. It was but the last flicker before extinction, and the wife knew it, but Rachel experienced a glow of hope that perhaps it might mean a temporary improvement.  \"I will go and see if he has come,\" she said. \"Perchance they have found and brought him by now.\"  She glided from the room, just giving one backward glance in so doing, when the expression on her mother's face brought a quick spasm of pain to her heart. There was a strange conflict of feeling going on within her, as she trod the corridor with swift steps, and passed rapidly down into the hall beneath.  This hall was a great square place, with a glowing fire illuminating it, the dancing shadows falling grotesquely upon the pictured Tuftons that lined the walls, and upon the weapons which hung, together with trophies of game, between them. In the centre of the hall was an oak table, heavily carved about the legs, and at this table stood a tall, broad-shouldered young man, clad in the stout leathern breeches and full coat of the period, tossing off a steaming tankard of some spirituous liquor, although the flush on his face, and the slightly unsteady way in which he held the vessel, seemed to indicate that he stood in no further need of strong drink.  Rachel came swiftly down the staircase, her footfall making scarcely any sound upon the shallow polished steps.  \"Tom!\" she exclaimed, in a voice full of repressed feeling, \"how can you delay drinking here, when your father upstairs is dying, and is asking for you?\"  \"Dying, quotha!\" returned the young man, with a foolish laugh; \"methinks I have heard that tale somewhat too often to be scared by it now, sweet sister!\" and he patted her shoulder with a gesture from which she instinctively recoiled.  \"Tom, have you no heart? He will not last the night through. Got you not our messages, sent hours ago? How can you show yourself so careless--so cruel? But tarry no longer now you are here. He has asked for you twice. Take care lest you dally too long!\"  Something in Rachel's face and in her manner of speaking seemed to make an impression upon"]]]
