What ho, there! What ho, there! Admit us! Make haste and let us pass, The sweepers are we. (_stamping their feet_) Look how it's snowing! What ho, there! We are frozen!  AN OFFICIAL. (_yawning and stretching himself_) All right!  (_Goes to open the gate; the scavengers pass through to the Rue d'Enfer. The official closes the gate again._)  CHORUS. (_from the tavern; the clink of glasses forms an accompaniment to the song_) Pass the glass, Let each toast his lass; Pass the glass, Let each lad toast his lass; Ha! Ha! Each one as he sips, As he sips his wine, Shall dream of lips Made for love divine!  MUS. (_from the tavern_) Ah! As the toper loves his glass, So the gallant loves his lass.  CHORUS. (_all bursting into laughter_) Noah and Eve!  MILK WOMEN. (_from within_) Houp-la! Houp-la!  (_A sergeant comes out of the guard-house and orders the toll-gate to be opened._)  CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICIAL. Here come the women with their milk.  (_A tinkling of cart-bells is heard._)  CARTERS. (_from within_) Houp-la!  (_Carts pass along the outer boulevard, lighted by large lanterns._)  MILK WOMEN. (_quite close_) Houp-la!  (_The gloom gradually gives way to daylight._)  MILK WOMEN. (_to the officials who admit them to the toll-gate_) Good-morrow!  PEASANT WOMEN. (_who enter carrying baskets_) Butter! Cheese! Chickens and eggs!  SOME. Which way, then, are you going?  OTHERS. Up to Saint Michael's.  SOME. Well, shall we see you later?  OTHERS. At twelve o'clock.  (_They go off in various directions, and the officials remove the bench and brazier._)  (_Enter _MIMI_ from the Rue d'Enfer; she looks about her as if anxious to make sure of her whereabouts. On reaching the first plane-tree she is seized by a violent fit of coughing. Then recovering herself, she sees the sergeant, whom she approaches._)  MIMI. Oh! Please, sir, tell me the name of that tavern Where now a painter's working?  SERGEANT. (_pointing to the tavern_) There it is.  MIMI. Thank you. (_A serving woman comes out of the tavern; _MIMI_ goes to her._) Oh! my good woman, pray do me this favor! Can you find me the painter, Marcel? I fain would see him; the matter's urgent; Just tell him softly that Mimi awaits him.  SERGEANT. (_to a passer-by_) Ho! there! What's in the basket?  OFFICIAL. (_after searching the basket_) Empty.  SERGEANT. Pass, there!  (_Other folk now pass through the toll-gate and move off in different directions. The bell of the Hospice Ste. Therese rings for matins._)  MAR. (_coming out of the inn_) Mimi!  MIMI. I hoped that I should find you here.  MAR. Aye, here we've been for a month: So to pay for our footing, Musetta teaches singing To those who come here. And I, well--I paint warriors-- There, on the house front!  MIMI. Where is Rudolph?  MAR. Here. 'Tis bitter, pray enter!  MIMI. (_bursting into tears_)  Enter I cannot, no!  MAR. Why not?  MIMI. Oh! good Marcel! oh! help me!  MAR. Say, what has happened?  MIMI. Rudolph is madly jealous! He loves and yet avoids me! A glance, a touch, a token, Suffice to make him jealous, And start his senseless fury! And oft at night, When feigning to be sleeping, I felt his eyes were watching to spy upon my slumbers! How oft he would reproach me! \"You are not mine, Mimi! You love another gallant!\" Alas! 'tis jealousy that prompts him. Yet how may I reply?  MAR. Two that live thus, I reckon, Would be surely better parted.  MIMI. You are right, you speak truly: 'Twere best we were parted. Will you aid us, then, Will you aid us to part? Oft to do this we have striven, but in vain. Ah! 'tis true, to part were the best.  MAR. I'm happy with Musetta, And she's happy with me. Because 'tis mirth that binds us together. Laughter, music and song, Ever our love prolong.  MIMI. Ah! then, aid us, I pray you!  MAR. 'Tis well, 'tis well! Now will I wake him.  MIMI. Wake him?  MAR. Overcome with fatigue, Just as dawn was approaching, On the bench fast lie slumbers,  (_Motions MIMI to look through the tavern window_)  Behold him! (_MIMI coughs persistently_)  What coughing!  MIMI. Unceasingly it shakes me, And Rudolph now forsakes me. And says to me, \"It is over!\" At daybreak swift escaping, I hurried here to find him.  MAR. (_watching RUDOLPH inside the tavern_) He's moving, waking, and wants me. Come, then.  MIMI. He must not see me.  MAR. Well, hide yourself out there.  (_Points to the plane-trees. MIMI hides behind the trees._)  RUD. (_coming out of the inn, hastens towards MARCEL_) Marcel! at last I've found you, Where none can hear us. I want a separation from Mimi.  MAR. Is that your latest whim?  RUD. Love in my heart was dying, almost was dead, But her blue eyes new glory on me shed. Love, swift revived, all me; what woe is mine!  MAR. Ah! would you now such bitter pain recall?  (_MIMI warily approaches to listen_)  RUD. Yes, always.  MAR. Nay, be prudent! Love is not worth the keeping, That only ends in weeping. Love must thrive in mirth and gladness, Or else it is but madness. 'Tis that you're jealous!  RUD. Aye, somewhat; And choleric, and lunatic, And a victim of vile suspicion, Unhappy, and stubborn!  MIMI. (_aside_) He's getting in a rage; Poor little Mimi!  RUD. Mimi's a heartless maiden, Prone to flirting with all. A scented dandy, some lordling, Now striveth to win her caresses. With bosom swaying, One foot displaying, Doth she lure him on With the magic of her smile.  MAR. Shall I be frank? I think 'tis hardly true.  RUD. No, 'tis not true. In vain, in vain I smother All the torture that racks me. I love Mimi, she is my only treasure! I love her, but, oh! I fear it!  (_Mimi surprised, comes closer and closer, under cover of the trees_)  Mimi's so sickly, so ailing, Every day she grows weaker, The poor girl, as I think, is dying.  MAR. (_fearing MIMI may overhear them, tries to keep RUDOLPH further off_) Oh! Rudolph!  MIMI. What's he saying?  RUD. By fierce, incessant coughing Her fragile frame is shaken, While in her cheeks so pallid The fires of fever waken.  MAR. (_agitated, perceiving that Mimi is listening_) Softly!  MIMI. (_weeping_) Woe is me! I'm dying!  RUD. And my room's but a squalid hovel, No fire there burneth, Only the cruel night wind Waileth, waileth there ever. Yet she's merry and smiling, While, remorseful, despairing, I feel that 'tis I that am guilty.  MAR. (_eager to draw RUDOLPH aside_) List but a moment!  MIMI. (_disconsolately_) Ah! I'm dying!  RUD. Mimi's a hot-house flower!  MAR. Nay, but listen!  MIMI. Ah me! ah me! All is over, life and loving, All are ended! Mimi must die!  MAR. Softly!  RUD. Want has wasted her beauty, And to bring her back to life Would need far more than love.  MAR. Nay, Rudolph, but listen!  (_Mimi's violent coughing and sobbing reveal her presence._)  RUD. Ha! Mimi! You here! You heard, you heard me? Swayed by each light suspicion, A trifle yet alarms me; Come, come inside here!  (_Seeks to take her into the tavern_)  MIMI. No, that odor is stifling me!  RUD. (_affectionately embracing her_) Ah, Mimi!  (_From the tavern Musetta's brazen laugh is heard._)  MAR. (_running to look through the window._) Tis Musetta that's laughing! Laughing, flirting! Ah! what a hussy! I'll not allow it. (_enters the tavern impetuously_)  MIMI. (_disengaging herself from_ RUDOLPH'S _embrace._) Farewell!  RUD. (_surprised_) What! Going?  MIMI. To the home that she left At the voice of her lover. Sad, forsaken Mimi Must turn back, heavy-hearted. For love and her lover Are gone, and she must die, Farewell, then! I wish you well! Nay, listen! listen! those things, Those few old things I've left behind me, Within my trunk safely arc stored. That bracelet of gold, The prayer-book you gave me, Pray wrap them up together in my little apron, And I will send to fetch them. Yet stay! Beneath the pillow You'll find my little bonnet-- Who knows? Maybe you'd like to keep it To remind you of our love! Farewell! Good-bye! I wish you well!  RUD. Then, you are going to leave me? Yes, you are going, my little Mimi? Ah! farewell, sweet dream of love!  MIMI. Farewell! farewell! Glad awakenings in the morning!  RUD. Farewell, our sweet love that vanished, Yet that your smile reviveth!  MIMI. (_playfully_) Farewell to jealousy and fury! Farewell suspicion, and its bitter anguish!  RUD. Kisses sweet that, as poet, I bought back with caresses!  MIMI and RUD. Lonely in winter, With Death as sole companion! But in glad springtime There's the sun, the glorious sun!  (_From the tavern the sound of breaking plates and glasses is heard_)  MUS. (_from within_) What d'ye mean? What d'ye mean? (_running out_)  MAR. (_from within_) You were laughing, you were flirting By the fireside with that stranger!  (_stopping on the threshold of the inn and confronting _MUSETTA)  And how you colored When I caught you in the corner!  MUS. (_defiantly_) Stuff and nonsense! all he said was: \"Are you very fond of dancing?\" And, half blushing, I made answer: \"I'd be dancing all day long, sir.\"  MAR. This is talk that only leads to things dishonest.  MUS. My own way I mean to have!  MAR. (_half menacing _MUSETTA) I will teach you better manners; Now if I catch you once more flirting--  MUS. What a bother! Why this anger? Why this fury? We're not married yet, thank goodness!  MAR. You shall not do as you like, miss! I will stop your little game!  MUS. I abhor that sort of lover Who pretends he is your husband!  MAR. I'm not going to be your blockhead, Just because you're fond of flirting!  MUS. I shall flirt just when it suits me!  MAR. You're most frivolous, Musetta!  MUS. Yes, I shall! yes, I shall! I shall flirt just when it suits me!  MAR. You can go, and God be with you!  MUS. Musetta's going away; Yes, going away!  MAR. And for me 'tis a good riddance!  MUS. Fare you well, sir!  MAR. Fare you well, ma'am!  MUS. I say farewell with all my heart!  MAR. Farewell, ma'am, pray begone!

RUD. _and_ MIMI. Our time for parting's when the roses blow!     ACT IV  \"At that period, indeed, for some time past, the friends had led lonely lives.  \"Musetta had once more become a sort of semi-official personage; for three or four months Marcel had never met her.  \"And Mimi, too, no word of her had Rudolph ever heard except when he talked about her to himself when he was alone.  \"One day, as Marcel furtively kissed a bunch of ribbons that Musetta had left behind, he saw Rudolph hiding away a bonnet, that same pink bonnet which Mimi had forgotten.  \"'Good!' muttered Marcel, 'he's as craven-hearted as I am.'\"         *        *        *        *        *  \"A gay life, yet a terrible one.\"     ACT IV   IN THE ATTIC   (_As in Act I_)  (MARCEL,_as before, stands in front of his easel, while _RUDOLPH_ sits at his writing table; each trying to make the other believe that he is working indefatigably, whereas they are really only gossiping.)_  MAR. (_resuming his talk_) In a coupé?  RUD. Yes, in carriage and pair did she merrily hail me. \"Well, Musetta,\" I questioned: \"How's your heart?\" \"It beats not--or I don't feel it--Thanks to this velvet I'm wearing!\"  MAR. (_endeavoring to laugh_) I'm glad, very glad!  RUD. (_aside_) You humbug, you! You're fretting and fuming!  MAR. It beats not! Bravo! (_commences to paint with great vigor_) Then I saw, too--  RUD. Musetta?  MAR. Mimi.  RUD. You saw her? How strange! (stops painting)  MAR. Rode in her carriage in grand apparel. Just like a duchess.  RUD. Delightful! I'm glad to hear it.  MAR. (_aside_) You liar! you're pining with love.  RUD. and MAR. Now to work! (_they go on working_)  RUD. (_throwing down his pen_) This pen's too awful! (_remains seated, apparently lost in thought_)  MAR. (_flinging away his brush_) This infamous paint-brush! (_Stares at his canvas, and then without RUDOLPH observing it, he takes from his pocket a bunch of ribbons and kisses it._)  RUD. Ah! Mimi! false, fickle-hearted! Ah! beauteous days departed! Those hands so dainty! Oh! fragrant, shining tresses! Ah! snow-white bosom! Ah! Mimi! those brief, glad, golden days!  MAR. (_putting away his ribbons and staring anew at his canvas_) How is it that my brush With speed mechanical keeps moving, And plasters on the colors Quite against my will? And though I would be painting landscapes, Meadows, woodlands fair in Spring-tide, My brush refuses to perform its office; But paints dark eyes, and two red, smiling lips; The features of Musetta haunt me still!  RUD. (_taking_ Mimi's _old bonnet from the table drawer_) And thou, O! rose-pink bonnet, That 'neath her pillow lay, That in her hour of parting she forgot--Thou wert the witness of our joy! Come to my heart, ah! come! Lie close against my heart, since my love is dead! (_clasps the bonnet to his heart_)  MAR. Ah! frivolous Musetta! thee can I ne'er forget! My grief affords her pleasure, And yet my weak heart is fain To call her to my fond arms again.  RUD. (_endeavoring to conceal his emotion from_ Marcel, _carelessly questions him_) What time is it now?  MAR. (_roused from his reverie, gaily replies_) Time for our yesterday's dinner.  RUD. But Schaunard's not back yet. (_Enter Schaunard_ _and_ Colline; _the former carries four rolls, and the latter a paper bag._)  SCH. Here we are!  RUD. How now?  MAR. How now?  (SCHAUNARD _places the rolls on the table._)  MAR. (_disdainfully_) Some bread!  COL. (_taking a herring out of the bag, and putting it on the table_) A dish that's worthy of Demosthenes: 'Tis a herring!  SCH. 'Tis salted!  COL. 'Our dinner is ready! (_Seating themselves at the table, they pretend to be having a sumptuous meal._)  MAR. This is a food that the gods might envy.  SCH. (_placing Colline's hat on the table, and thrusting a bottle of water into it_) Now the champagne in the ice must go.  RUD. (_to_ MARCEL, _offering him some bread_) Choose, my lord marquis--salmon or turbot? (_His offer is accepted, when, turning to _SCHAUNARD, _he proffers another crust of bread._) Now, duke, here's a choice vol-au-vent with mushrooms. (_He politely declines, and pours out a glass of water, which he hands to_ Marcel.)  SCH. Thank you, I dare not, this evening I'm dancing! (_The one and only tumbler is handed about._ Colline, _after voraciously devouring his roll, rises._)  RUD. (_to_ Colline) What? sated?  COL. (_with an air of great importance_) To business! The king awaits me.  MAR. (_eagerly_) What plot is brewing?  RUD. What's in the wind?  SCH. (_rises and approaches_ Colline, _observing with droll inquisitiveness_) What's in the wind?  MAR. What's in the wind?  (COLLINE _struts up and down, full of self-importance._)  COL. The king requires my services.  (_The others surround_ COLLINE, _bowing low to him._)  SCH. Bravo!  MAR. Bravo!  RUD. Bravo!  COL. (_with a patronizing air_) And then I've got to see Guizot!  SCH. Give me a goblet.  MAR. (_giving him the only glass_) Aye, quaff now a bumper!  SCH. (_solemnly gets on to a chair and raises his glass_) Have I permission, oh! my most noble courtier?  RUD. and COL. (_interrupting_) Stop that.  COL. No more fooling.  MAR. Stop that. No more nonsense.  COL. Give me that tumbler. (_taking the glass from_ SCHAUNARD)  SCH. (_motioning his friends to let him speak_) With ardor irresistible Poetry fills my spirit.  COL. and MAR. (_yelling_) No.  SCH. (_complacently_) Then something choreographic may suit you!  RUD., MAR. and COL. Yes, yes! (_Amid applause they surround_ Schaunard _and make him get off the chair._)  SCH. Some dancing, accompanied by singing?  COL. Well, clear the stage for action. (_Moving chairs and tables aside, they prepare for a dance; they suggest various dances._)  COL. Gavotte.  MAR. Minuet.  RUD. Pavanella.  SCH. (_imitating a Spanish measure_) Fandango.  COL. I vote we dance quadrilles first. (_the others approve_)  RUD. Now take your partners.  COL. I'll lead it. (_pretends to be very busy arranging a quadrille_)  SCH. (_improvising, beats time with comic pomposity of manner_) La-lera, la-lera, la-lera!  RUD. (_approaching_ MARCEL_, and bowing very low, offers him his hand as he gallantly says_) Oh! maiden fair and gentle!  MAR. (_with coy bashfulness of manner, counterfeiting a woman's voice_) My modesty respect, sir, I beg you.  SCH. Lal-lera, lal-lera, lal-lera, la!  COL. (_giving directions as to the figures, while_ RUDOLPH _and_ MARCEL _dance the quadrille_) Balancez!  MAR. (_in his ordinary voice_) Lal-lera, lal-lera, lal-lera!  SCH. (_teasingly_) First there's the Rond.  COL. No, stupid!  SCH. (_with exaggerated contempt_) You've manners like a clown!  COL. (_offended_) As I take it, you're insulting! Draw your sword, sir!  (_rushes to the fireplace and seizes the tongs_)  SCH. (_taking up the poker_) Ready! Have at you! (_preparing to receive his adversary's attack_) Thy hot blood would I drink!  COL. (_doing likewise_) One of us shall now be gutted! (Rudolph _and_ Marcel _stop dancing and burst out laughing._)  SCH. Now get a stretcher ready.  COL. And get a grave-yard, too.  (SCHAUNARD _and_ COLLINE _fight._)  RUD. and MAR. (_gaily_) While they beat each other's brains out, Our fandango we will finish. (_They dance round the combatants, whose blows fall faster. The door opens and_ Musetta _enters in a state of great agitation._)  MAR. (_amazed_) Musetta! (_All anxiously cluster round_ Musetta)  MUS. (_hoarsely_) 'Tis Mimi--'tis Mimi who is with me--And is ailing!  RUD. Mimi!  MUS. She has not strength to climb the staircase. (_Through the open door _RUDOLPH_ spies _MIMI_, seated on the topmost stair; he rushes to her, followed by _MARCEL.)  SCH. (_to _COLLINE) Here's the bed: we'll put her on it. (_they drag the bed forward_)  RUD. (_supporting _MIMI_ and leading her towards the bed, aided by _MARCEL) There! some water!  (_MUSETTA_ brings a glass of water and makes _MIMI_ sip it.)  MIMI. (_passionately_) Oh, Rudolph!  RUD. Gently, lie down there. (_gently lowers her on the bed_)  MIMI. (_embracing RUDOLPH_) My darling Rudolph! Ah! let me stay with you!  RUD. Darling Mimi! stay here ever! (_He induces _Mimi_ to lie down at full length on the bed, and draws the coverlet over her; he then carefully adjusts the pillow be neath her head._)  MUS. (_taking the others aside and whispering to them_) I heard them saying that Mimi Had left the rich old viscount; And now was almost dying. Ah! but where? After searching, I met her alone just now, Almost dead with exhaustion. She murmured: \"I'm dying! dying! But listen; I want to die near him. Maybe he's waiting! Take me thither, Musetta!\"  MAR. Hush! (_MUSETTA moves farther away from MIMI._)  MIMI. I feel so much better. All here seems just the same as ever. (_with a sweet smile_) Ah! It is all so pleasant here! Saved from sadness, All is gladness; Once again new life is mine!  RUD. Lips delightful, speak again to me! Once more enchant me!  MIMI. Ah! beloved! Ah! leave me not!  MUS. (_aside to the others_) What is there to give her?  MAR. _and_ COL. Nothing!  MUS. No coffee? no wine?  MAR. (_in great dejection_) Nothing; the larder's empty.  SCH. (_looking closely at Mimi_) In an hour she'll be dead!  MIMI. I feel so cold! If I had but my muff here! My poor hands are simply frozen! How shall I get them warm?
