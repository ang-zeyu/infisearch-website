We here reach a     point at which Individualism is at one with Socialism. The     individualist cannot fail to see that it is at all cost necessary     to remove social conditions which crush out all individuality;     the Socialist cannot fail to see that a society which neglects to     introduce order at this central and vital point, the production     of the individual, must speedily perish.  It is involved in the proper fulfilment of a mother's relationship to her infant child that, provided she is healthy, she should suckle it. Of recent years this question has become a matter of serious gravity. In the middle of the eighteenth century, when the upper-class women of France had grown disinclined to suckle their own children, Rousseau raised so loud and eloquent a protest that it became once more the fashion for a woman to fulfil her natural duties. At the present time, when the same evil is found once more, and in a far more serious form, for now it is not the small upper-class but the great lower-class that is concerned, the eloquence of a Rousseau would be powerless, for it is not fashion so much as convenience, and especially an intractable economic factor, that is chiefly concerned. Not the least urgent reason for putting women, and especially mothers, upon a sounder economic basis, is the necessity of enabling them to suckle their children.      No woman is sound, healthy, and complete unless she possesses     breasts that are beautiful enough to hold the promise of being     functional when the time for their exercise arrives, and nipples     that can give suck. The gravity of this question to-day is shown     by the frequency with which women are lacking in this essential     element of womanhood, and the young man of to-day, it has been     said, often in taking a wife, \"actually marries but part of a     woman, the other part being exhibited in the chemist's shop     window, in the shape of a glass feeding-bottle.\" Blacker found     among a thousand patients from the maternity department of     University College Hospital that thirty-nine had never suckled at     all, seven hundred and forty-seven had suckled all their     children, and two hundred and fourteen had suckled only some.     The chief reason given for not suckling was absence or     insufficiency of milk; other reasons being inability or     disinclination to suckle, and refusal of the child to take the     breast (Blacker, _Medical Chronicle_, Feb., 1900). These results     among the London poor are certainly very much better than could     be found in many manufacturing towns where women work after     marriage. In the other large countries of Europe equally     unsatisfactory results are found. In Paris Madame Dluska has     shown that of 209 women who came for their confinement to the     Clinique Baudelocque, only 74 suckled their children; of the 135     who did not suckle, 35 were prevented by pathological causes or     absence of milk, 100 by the necessities of their work. Even those     who suckled could seldom continue more than seven months on     account of the physiological strain of work (Dluska,     _Contribution à l'Etude de l'Allaitement Maternel_, Thèse de     Paris, 1894). Many statistics have been gathered in the German     countries. Thus Wiedow (_Centralblatt für Gynäkologie_, No. 29,     1895) found that of 525 women at the Freiburg Maternity only half     could suckle thoroughly during the first two weeks; imperfect     nipples were noted in 49 cases, and it was found that the     development of the nipple bore a direct relation to the value of     the breast as a secretory organ. At Munich Escherich and Büller     found that nearly 60 per cent. of women of the lower class were     unable to suckle their children, and at Stuttgart three-quarters     of the child-bearing women were in this condition.  The reasons why children should be suckled at their mothers' breasts are larger than some may be inclined to believe. In the first place the psychological reason is one of no mean importance. The breast with its exquisitely sensitive nipple, vibrating in harmony with the sexual organs, furnishes the normal mechanism by which maternal love is developed. No doubt the woman who never suckles her child may love it, but such love is liable to remain defective on the fundamental and instinctive side. In some women, indeed, whom we may hesitate to call abnormal, maternal love fails to awaken at all until brought into action through this mechanism by the act of suckling.  A more generally recognized and certainly fundamental reason for suckling the child is that the milk of the mother, provided she is reasonably healthy, is the infant's only ideally fit food. There are some people whose confidence in science leads them to believe that it is possible to manufacture foods that are as good or better than mother's milk; they fancy that the milk which is best for the calf is equally best for so different an animal as the baby. These are delusions. The infant's best food is that elaborated in his own mother's body. All other foods are more or less possible substitutes, which require trouble to prepare properly and are, moreover, exposed to various risks from which the mother's milk is free.  A further reason, especially among the poor, against the use of any artificial foods is that it accustoms those around the child to try experiments with its feeding and to fancy that any kind of food they eat themselves may be good for the infant. It thus happens that bread and potatoes, brandy and gin, are thrust into infants' mouths. With the infant that is given the breast it is easier to make plain that, except by the doctor's orders, nothing else must be given.  An additional reason why the mother should suckle her child is the close and frequent association with the child thus involved. Not only is the child better cared for in all respects, but the mother is not deprived of the discipline of such care, and is also enabled from the outset to learn and to understand the child's nature.      The inability to suckle acquires great significance if we realize     that it is associated, probably in a large measure as a direct     cause, with infantile mortality. The mortality of     artificially-fed infants during the first year of life is seldom     less than double that of the breast-fed, sometimes it is as much     as three times that of the breast-fed, or even more; thus at     Derby 51.7 per cent. of hand-fed infants die under the age of     twelve months, but only 8.6 per cent. of breast-fed infants.     Those who survive are by no means free from suffering. At the end     of the first year they are found to weigh about 25 per cent. less     than the breast-fed, and to be much shorter; they are more liable     to tuberculosis and rickets, with all the evil results that flow     from these diseases; and there is some reason to believe that the     development of their teeth is injuriously affected. The     degenerate character of the artificially-fed is well indicated by     the fact that of 40,000 children who were brought for treatment     to the Children's Hospital in Munich, 86 per cent. had been     brought up by hand, and the few who had been suckled had usually     only had the breast for a short time. The evil influence persists     even up to adult life. In some parts of France where the     wet-nurse industry flourishes so greatly that nearly all the     children are brought up by hand, it has been found that the     percentage of rejected conscripts is nearly double that for     France generally. Corresponding results have been found by     Friedjung in a large German athletic association. Among 155     members, 65 per cent. were found on inquiry to have been     breast-fed as infants (for an average of six months); but among     the best athletes the percentage of breast-fed rose to 72 per     cent. (for an average period of nine or ten months), while for     the group of 56 who stood lowest in athletic power the percentage     of breast-fed fell to 57 (for an average of only three months).      The advantages for an infant of being suckled by its mother are     greater than can be accounted for by the mere fact of being     suckled rather than hand-fed. This has been shown by Vitrey (_De     la Mortalité Infantile_, Thèse de Lyon, 1907), who found from the     statistics of the Hôtel-Dieu at Lyons, that infants suckled by     their mothers have a mortality of only 12 per cent., but if     suckled by strangers, the mortality rises to 33 per cent. It may     be added that, while suckling is essential to the complete     well-being of the child, it is highly desirable for the sake of     the mother's health also. (Some important statistics are     summarized in a paper on \"Infantile Mortality\" in _British     Medical Journal_, Nov. 2, 1907), while the various aspects of     suckling have been thoroughly discussed by Bollinger, \"Ueber     Säuglings-Sterblichkeit und die Erbliche functionelle Atrophie     der menschlichen Milchdrüse\" (_Correspondenzblatt Deutschen     Gesellschaft Anthropologie_, Oct., 1899).      It appears that in Sweden, in the middle of the eighteenth     century, it was a punishable offense for a woman to give her baby     the bottle when she was able to suckle it. In recent years Prof.     Anton von Menger, of Vienna, has argued (in his _Burgerliche     Recht und die Besitzlosen Klassen_) that the future generation     has the right to make this claim, and he proposes that every     mother shall be legally bound to suckle her child unless her     inability to do so has been certified by a physician. E.A.     Schroeder (_Das Recht in der Geschlechtlichen Ordnung_, 1893, p.     346) also argued that a mother should be legally bound to suckle     her infant for at least nine months, unless"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],["title","The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Peterborough Cathedral, From The South-east.]       THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF            PETERBOROUGH      A DESCRIPTION OF ITS FABRIC      AND A BRIEF HISTORY OF         THE EPISCOPAL SEE                  BY     THE REV.

PREFACE.   The chief authorities consulted in the preparation of this book are named in the text. Besides the well-known works of reference on the English Cathedrals, and the \"Monastic Chronicles,\" there are several that deal with Peterborough alone, of which the most important and valuable are \"Gunton's History\" with Dean Patrick's Supplement, \"Craddock's History,\" the monographs by Professor Paley and Mr Poole, and the Guide of Canon Davys. If I have ventured to differ from some of these writers on various points, I must appeal, in justification, to a careful and painstaking study of the Cathedral and its history, during a residence at Peterborough of more than twenty years.  My best thanks are due to Mr Caster of Peterborough, for permission to incorporate with this account the substance of a Guide, which I prepared for him, published in 1893; and to Mr Robert Davison of London, for his description of the Mosaic Pavement, executed by him for the Choir. I desire also to express my thanks for the drawings supplied by Mr W.H. Lord, Mr H.P. Clifford, and Mr O.R. Allbrow; and to acknowledge my indebtedness to the Photochrom Company, Ld., and to Messrs S.B. Bolas & Co., for their excellent photographs.  W.D. SWEETING.

CHAPTER I.  HISTORY OF THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF S. PETER.   Until the middle of the nineteenth century, Peterborough remained one of the most unchanged examples in the kingdom of the monastic borough. The place was called into existence by the monastery and was entirely dependent on it. The Abbot was supreme lord, and had his own gaol. He possessed great power over the whole hundred. And even after the See of Peterborough was constituted, and the Abbey Church became a cathedral, many of the ancient privileges were retained by the newly formed Dean and Chapter. They still retained the proclamation and control of the fairs; their officer, the high bailiff, was the returning officer at elections for parliament; they regulated the markets; they appointed the coroner. Professor Freeman contrasts an Abbot's town with a Bishop's town, when speaking about the city of Wells.[1] \"An Abbot's borough might arise anywhere; no better instance can be found than the borough of S. Peter itself, that Golden Borough which often came to be called distinctively the Borough without further epithet.\" And again, \"the settlement which arose around the great fenland monastery of S. Peter, the holy house of Medeshampstead, grew by degrees into a borough, and by later ecclesiastical arrangements, into a city, a city and borough to which the changes of our own day have given a growth such as it never knew before.\"  Situated on the edge of the Fens, some miles to the east of the great north road, without any special trade, and without any neighbouring territorial magnates, it is hardly surprising that the place seemed incapable of progress, and remained long eminently respectable and stagnant. In one of his caustic epigrams Dean Duport does indeed speak of the wool-combers as if there were a recognised calling that employed some numbers of men; but he is not complimentary to those employed, for he says that the men that comb the wool, and the sheep that bear it, are on a par as regards intelligence:      \"At vos simplicitate pares et moribus estis,     Lanificique homines, lanigerique greges.\"  In another epigram he derides the city itself, calling it contemptuously \"Urbicula\"; and he suggests, with a humour that to modern ideas savours of irreverence, that this little city of S. Peter's, \"Petropolis,\" unless S. Peter had the keys, would run away through its own gates.  The great development of the last half of the nineteenth century is due to the railway works at New England, and to the Great Northern Line making Peterborough an important railway centre. In 1807 the entire population of the city and hamlets was under 3,500. In 1843 it was just over 5,500, and when the railway was laid it was not much more than 6,000. It has since gone up by leaps and bounds. In 1861 the population exceeded 11,000. By 1911 it had grown by steady increments to 33,578. The private diary of a resident of about 1850 would read like an old world record. The"]]]
