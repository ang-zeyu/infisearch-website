Johnston, _British     Central Africa_, 1897, pp. 408-419.)      In Azimba land, Central Africa, H. Crawford Angus, who has spent     many years in this part of Africa, writes: \"It has been my     experience that the more naked the people, and the more to us     obscene and shameless their manners and customs, the more moral     and strict they are in the matter of sexual intercourse.\" He     proceeds to give a description of the _chensamwali_, or     initiation ceremony of girls at puberty, a season of rejoicing     when the girl is initiated into all the secrets of marriage, amid     songs and dances referring to the act of coition. \"The whole     matter is looked upon as a matter of course, and not as a thing     to be ashamed of or to hide, and, being thus openly treated of     and no secrecy made about it, you find in this tribe that the     women are very virtuous. They know from the first all that is to     be known, and cannot see any reason for secrecy concerning     natural laws or the powers and senses that have been given them     from birth.\" (_Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1898, Heft 6, p.     479.)      Of the Monbuttu of Central Africa, another observer says: \"It is     surprising how a Monbuttu woman of birth can, without the aid of     dress, impress others with her dignity and modesty.\" (_British     Medical Journal_. June 14, 1890.)      \"The women at Upoto wear no clothes whatever, and came up to us     in the most unreserved manner. An interesting gradation in the     arrangement of the female costume has been observed by us: as we     ascended the Congo, the higher up the river we found ourselves,     the higher the dress reached, till it has now, at last,     culminated in absolute nudity.\" (T.H. Parke, _My Personal     Experiences in Equatorial Africa_, 1891, p. 61.)      \"There exists throughout the Congo population a marked     appreciation of the sentiment of decency and shame as applied to     private actions,\" says Mr. Herbert Ward. In explanation of the     nudity of the women at Upoto, a chief remarked to Ward that     \"concealment is food for the inquisitive.\" (_Journal of the     Anthropological Institute_, 1895, p. 293.)      In the Gold Coast and surrounding countries complete nudity is     extremely rare, except when circumstances make it desirable; on     occasion clothing is abandoned with unconcern. \"I have on several     occasions,\" says Dr. Freeman, \"seen women at Accra walk from the     beach, where they have been bathing, across the road to their     houses, where they would proceed to dry themselves, and resume     their garments; and women may not infrequently be seen bathing in     pools by the wayside, conversing quite unconstrainedly with their     male acquaintances, who are seated on the bank. The mere     unclothed body conveys to their minds no idea of indecency.     Immodesty and indelicacy of manner are practically unknown.\" He     adds that the excessive zeal of missionaries in urging their     converts to adopt European dress--which they are only too ready     to do--is much to be regretted, since the close-fitting, thin     garments are really less modest than the loose clothes they     replace, besides being much less cleanly. (R.A. Freeman, _Travels     and Life in Ashanti and Jaman_, 1898, p. 379.)      At Loango, says Pechuel-Loesche, \"the well-bred negress likes to     cover her bosom, and is sensitive to critical male eyes; if she     meets a European when without her overgarment, she instinctively,     though not without coquetry, takes the attitude of the Medicean     Venus.\" Men and women bathe separately, and hide themselves from     each other when naked. The women also exhibit shame when     discovered suckling their babies. (_Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_,     1878, pp. 27-31.)      The Koran (Sura XXIV) forbids showing the pudenda, as well as the     face, yet a veiled Mohammedan woman, Stern remarks, even in the     streets of Constantinople, will stand still and pull up her     clothes to scratch her private parts, and in Beyrout, he saw     Turkish prostitutes, still veiled, place themselves in the     position for coitus. (B. Stern, _Medizin, etc., in der Türkei_,     vol. ii, p. 162.)      \"An Englishman surprised a woman while bathing in the Euphrates;     she held her hands over her face, without troubling as to what     else the stranger might see. In Egypt, I have myself seen quite     naked young peasant girls, who hastened to see us, after covering     their faces.\" (C. Niebuhr, _Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien_,     1774, vol. i, p. 165.)      When Helfer was taken to visit the ladies in the palace of the     Imam of Muskat, at Buscheir, he found that their faces were     covered with black masks, though the rest of the body might be     clothed in a transparent sort of crape; to look at a naked face     was very painful to the ladies themselves; even a mother never     lifts the mask from the face of her daughter after the age of     twelve; that is reserved for her lord and husband. \"I observed     that the ladies looked at me with a certain confusion, and after     they had glanced into my face, lowered their eyes, ashamed. On     making inquiries, I found that my uncovered face was indecent, as     a naked person would be to us. They begged me to assume a mask,     and when a waiting-woman had bound a splendidly decorated one     round my head, they all exclaimed: 'Tahip! tahip!'--beautiful,     beautiful.\" (J.W. Helfer, _Reisen in Vorderasian und Indien_,     vol. ii, p. 12.)      In Algeria--in the provinces of Constantine, in Biskra, even     Aures,--\"among the women especially, not one is restrained by any     modesty in unfastening her girdle to any comer\" (when a search     was being made for tattoo-marks on the lower extremities). \"In     spite of the great licentiousness of the manners,\" the same     writer continues, \"the Arab and the Kabyle possess great personal     modesty, and with difficulty are persuaded to exhibit the body     nude; is it the result of real modesty, or of their inveterate     habits of active pederasty? Whatever the cause, they always hide     the sexual organs with their hands or their handkerchiefs, and     are disagreeably affected even by the slightest touch of the     doctor.\" (Batut, _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, January     15, 1893.)      \"Moslem modesty,\" remarks Wellhausen, \"was carried to great     lengths, insufficient clothing being forbidden. It was marked     even among the heathen Arabs, as among Semites and old     civilizations generally; we must not be deceived by the     occasional examples of immodesty in individual cases. The Sunna     prescribes that a man shall not uncover himself even to himself,     and shall not wash naked--from fear of God and of spirits; Job     did so, and atoned for it heavily. When in Arab antiquity     grown-up persons showed themselves naked, it was only under     extraordinary circumstances, and to attain unusual ends.... Women     when mourning uncovered not only the face and bosom, but also     tore all their garments. The messenger who brought bad news tore     his garments. A mother desiring to bring pressure to bear on her     son took off her clothes. A man to whom vengeance is forbidden     showed his despair and disapproval by uncovering his posterior     and strewing earth on his head, or by raising his garment behind     and covering his head with it. This was done also in fulfilling     natural necessities.\" (Wellhausen, _Reste Arabischen Heidentums_,     1897, pp. 173, 195-196.)      Mantegazza mentions that a Lapland woman refused even for the sum     of 150 francs to allow him to photograph her naked, though the     men placed themselves before the camera in the costume of Adam     for a much smaller sum. In the same book Mantegazza remarks that     in the eighteenth century, travelers found it extremely difficult     to persuade Samoyed women to show themselves naked. Among the     same people, he says, the newly-married wife must conceal her     face from her husband for two months after marriage, and only     then yield to his embraces. (Mantegazza, _La Donna_, cap. IV.)      \"The beauty of a Chinese woman,\" says Dr. Matignon, \"resides     largely in her foot. 'A foot which is not deformed is a     dishonor,' says a poet. For the husband the foot is more     interesting than the face. Only the husband may see his wife's     foot naked. A Chinese woman is as reticent in showing her feet to     a man as a European woman her breasts. I have often had to treat     Chinese women with ridiculously small feet for wounds and     excoriations, the result of tight-bandaging. They exhibited the     prudishness of school-girls, blushed, turned their backs to     unfasten the bandages, and then concealed the foot in a cloth,     leaving only the affected part uncovered. Modesty is a question     of convention; Chinese have it for their feet,\" (J. Matignon, \"A     propos d'un Pied de Chinoise,\" _Archives d'Anthropologie     Criminelle_, 1898, p. 445.)      Among the Yakuts of Northeast Siberia, \"there was a well-known     custom according to which a bride should avoid showing herself or     her uncovered body to her father-in-law. In ancient times, they     say, a bride concealed herself for seven years from her     father-in-law, and from the brothers and other masculine     relations of her husband.... The men also tried not to meet her,     saying, 'The poor child will be ashamed.' If a meeting could not     be avoided the young woman put a mask on her face.... Nowadays,     the young "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#8)"],["body","only avoid showing to their male relatives-in-law     the uncovered body. Amongst the rich they avoid going about in     the presence of these in the chemise alone. In some places, they     lay especial emphasis on the fact that it is a shame for young     wives to show their uncovered hair and feet to the male relatives     of their husbands. On the other side, the male relatives of the     husband ought to avoid showing to the young wife the body     uncovered above the elbow or the sole of the foot, and they ought     to avoid indecent expressions and vulgar vituperations in her     presence.... That these observances are not the result of a     specially delicate modesty, is proved by the fact that even young     girls constantly twist thread upon the naked thigh, unembarrassed     by the presence of men who do not belong to the household; nor do     they show any embarrassment if a strange man comes upon them when     uncovered to the waist. The one thing which they do not like, and     at which they show anger, is that such persons look carefully at     their uncovered feet.... The former simplicity, with lack of     shame in uncovering the body, is disappearing.\" (Sieroshevski,     \"The Yakuts,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_,     Jan.-June, 1901, p. 93.)      \"In Japan (Captain ---- tells me), the bathing-place of the women     was perfectly open (the shampooing, indeed, was done by a man),     and Englishmen were offered no obstacle, nor excited the least     repugnance; indeed, girls after their bath would freely pass,     sometimes as if holding out their hair for innocent admiration,     and this continued until countrymen of ours, by vile laughter and     jests, made them guard themselves from insult by secrecy. So     corruption spreads, and heathenism is blacker by our contact.\"     (Private communication.)      \"Speaking once with a Japanese gentleman, I observed that we     considered it an act of indecency for men and women to wash     together. He shrugged his shoulders as he answered: 'But these     Westerns have such prurient minds!'\" (Mitford, _Tales of Old     Japan_, 1871.)      Dr. Carl Davidsohn, who remarks that he had ample opportunity of     noting the great beauty of the Japanese women in a national     dance, performed naked, points out that the Japanese have no     æsthetic sense for the nude. \"This was shown at the Jubilee     Exposition at Kyoto. Here, among many rooms full of art objects,     one was devoted to oil pictures in the European manner. Among     these only one represented a nude figure, a Psyche, or Truth. It     was the first time such a picture had been seen. Men and women     crowded around it. After they had gazed at it for a time, most     began to giggle and laugh; some by their air and gestures clearly     showed their disgust; all found that it was not æsthetic to paint     a naked woman, though in Nature, nakedness was in no way     offensive to them. In the middle of the same city, at a fountain     reputed to possess special virtues, men and women will stand     together naked and let the water run over them.\" (Carl     Davidsohn, \"Das Nackte bei den Japanern,\" _Globus_, 1896, No.     16.)      \"It is very difficult to investigate the hairiness of Ainu     women,\" Baelz remarks, \"for they possess a really incredible     degree of modesty. Even when in summer they bathe--which happens     but seldom--they keep their clothes on.\" He records that he was     once asked to examine a girl at the Mission School, in order to     advise as regards the treatment of a diseased spine; although she     had been at the school for seven years, she declared that \"she     would rather die than show her back to a man, even though a     doctor.\" (Baelz, \"Die Aino,\" _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1901,     Heft 2, p. 178.)      The Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, appear to have been accustomed     to cover the foreskin with the _kynodesme_ (a band), or the     _fibula_ (a ring), for custom and modesty demanded that the glans     should be concealed. Such covering is represented in persons who     were compelled to be naked, and is referred to by Celsus as     \"decori causâ.\" (L. Stieda, \"Anatomisch-archäologische Studien,\"     _Anatomische Hefte_, Bd. XIX, Heft 2, 1902.)      \"Among the Lydians, and, indeed, among the barbarians generally,     it is considered a deep disgrace, even for a man, to be seen     naked.\" (Herodotus, Book I, Chapter X.)      \"The simple dress which is now common was first worn in Sparta,     and there, more than anywhere else, the life of the rich was     assimilated to that of the people. The Lacedæmonians, too, were     the first who, in their athletic exercises, stripped naked and     rubbed themselves over with oil. This was not the ancient custom;     athletes formerly, even when they were contending at Olympia,     wore girdles about their loins [earlier still, the Mycenæans had     always worn a loin-cloth], a practice which lasted until quite     lately, and still persists among barbarians, especially those of     Asia, where the combatants at boxing and wrestling matches wear     girdles.\" (Thucydides, _History_, Book I, Chapter VI.)      \"The notion of the women exercising naked in the schools with the     men ... at the present day would appear truly ridiculous.... Not     long since it was thought discreditable and ridiculous among the     Greeks, as it is now among most barbarous nations, for men to be     seen naked. And when the Cretans first, and after them the     Lacedæmonians, began the practice of gymnastic exercises, the     wits of the time had it in their power to make sport of those     novelties.... As for the man who laughs at the idea of undressed     women going through gymnastic exercises, as a means of revealing     what is most perfect, his ridicule is but 'unripe fruit plucked     from the tree of wisdom.'\" (Plato, _Republic_, Book V.)      According to Plutarch, however, among the Spartans, at all     events, nakedness in women was not ridiculous, since the     institutes of Lycurgus ordained that at solemn feasts and     sacrifices the young women should dance naked and sing, the young     men standing around in a circle to see and hear them. Aristotle     says that in his time Spartan girls only wore a very slight     garment. As described by Pausanias, and as shown by a statue in     the Vatican, the ordinary tunic, which was the sole garment worn     by women when running, left bare the right shoulder and breast,     and only reached to the upper third of the thighs. (M.M. Evans,     _Chapters on Greek Dress_, p. 34.)      Among the Greeks who were inclined to accept the doctrines of     Cynicism, it was held that, while shame is not unreasonable, what     is good may be done and discussed before all men. There are a     number of authorities who say that Crates and Hipparchia     consummated their marriage in the presence of many spectators.     Lactantius (_Inst._ iii, 15) says that the practice was common,     but this Zeller is inclined to doubt. (Zeller, _Socrates and the     Socratic Schools_, translated from the Third German Edition,     1897.)      \"Among the Tyrrhenians, who carry their luxury to an     extraordinary pitch, Timæus, in his first book, relates that the     female servants wait on the men in a state of nudity. And     Theopompus, in the forty-third book of his _History_, states that     it is a law among the Tyrrhenians that all their women should be     in common; and that the women pay the greatest attention to their     persons, and often practice gymnastic exercises, naked, among the     men, and sometimes with one another; for that it is not accounted     shameful for them to be seen naked.... Nor is it reckoned among     the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do or suffer     anything in the open air, or to be seen while it is going on; for     it is quite the custom of their country, and they are so far from     thinking it disgraceful that they even say, when the master of     the house is indulging his appetite, and anyone asks for him,     that he is doing so and so, using the coarsest possible words....     And they are very beautiful, as is natural for people to be who     live delicately, and who take care of their persons.\" (Athenæus,     _Deipnosophists_, Yonge's translation, vol. iii, p. 829.)      Dennis throws doubt on the foregoing statement of Athenæus     regarding the Tyrrhenians or Etruscans, and points out that the     representations of women in Etruscan tombs shows them as clothed,     even the breast being rarely uncovered. Nudity, he remarks, was a     Greek, not an Etruscan, characteristic. \"To the nudity of the     Spartan women I need but refer; the Thessalian women are     described by Persæus dancing at banquets naked, or with a very     scanty covering (_apud_ Athenæus, xiii, c. 86). The maidens of     Chios wrestled naked with the youths in the gymnasium, which     Athenæus (xiii, 20) pronounces to be 'a beautiful sight.' And at     the marriage feast of Caranus, the Macedonian women tumblers     performed naked before the guests (Athenæus, iv, 3).\" (G. Dennis,     _Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria_, 1883, vol. i, p. 321.)      In Rome, \"when there was at first much less freedom in this     matter than in Greece, the bath became common to both sexes, and     though each had its basin and hot room apart, they could see each     other, meet, speak, form intrigues, arrange meetings, and     multiply adulteries. At first, the baths were so dark that men     and women could wash side by side, without recognizing each other     except by the voice; but soon the light of day was allowed to     enter from every side. 'In the bath of Scipio,' said Seneca,     'there were narrow ventholes, rather than windows, hardly     admitting enough light to outrage modesty; but nowadays, baths     are called caves if they do not receive the sun's"]]]
