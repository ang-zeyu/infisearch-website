By using the mind, you will be able to separate it into its parts, and force it to give you its own answer to the questions touching itself.  In the second and third lessons of our \"_Fourteen Lessons_,\" we pointed out to you the fact that man had three Mental Principles, or subdivisions of mind, all of which were below the plane of Spirit. The \"I\" is Spirit, but its mental principles are of a lower order. Without wishing to unduly repeat ourselves, we think it better to run hastily over these three Principles in the mind of Man.  First, there is what is known as the Instinctive Mind, which man shares in common with the lower animals. It is the first principle of mind that appears in the scale of evolution. In its lowest phases, consciousness is but barely perceptible, and mere sensation is apparent. In its higher stages it almost reaches the plane of Reason or Intellect, in fact, they overlap each other, or, rather, blend into each other. The Instinctive Mind does valuable work in the direction of maintaining animal life in our bodies, it having charge of this part of our being. It attends to the constant work of repair; replacement; change; digestion; assimilation; elimination, etc., all of which work is performed below the plane of consciousness.  But this is but a small part of the work of the Instinctive Mind. For this part of the mind has stored up all the experiences of ourselves and ancestors in our evolution from the lower forms of animal life into the present stage of evolution. All of the old animal instincts (which were all right in their place, and quite necessary for the well-being of the lower forms of life) have left traces in this part of the mind, which traces are apt to come to the front under pressure of unusual circumstances, even long after we think we have outgrown them. In this part of the mind are to be found traces of the old fighting instinct of the animal; all the animal passions; all the hate, envy, jealousy, and the rest of it, which are our inheritances from the past. The Instinctive Mind is also the \"habit mind\" in which is stored up all the little, and great, habits of many lives, or rather such as have not been entirely effaced by subsequent habits of a stronger nature. The Instinctive Mind is a queer storehouse, containing quite a variety of objects, many of them very good in their way, but others of which are the worst kind of old junk and rubbish.  This part of the mind also is the seat of the appetites; passions; desires; instincts; sensations; feelings and emotions of the lower order, manifested in the lower animals; primitive man; the barbarian; and the man of today, the difference being only in the degree of control over them that has been gained by the higher parts of the mind. There are higher desires, aspirations, etc., belonging to a higher part of the mind, which we will describe in a few minutes, but the \"animal nature\" belongs to the Instinctive Mind. To it also belong the \"feelings\" belonging to our emotional and passional nature. All animal desires, such as hunger and thirst; sexual desires (on the physical plane); all passions, such as physical love; hatred; envy; malice; jealousy; revenge, etc., are part of this part of the mind. The desire for the physical (unless a means of reaching higher things) and the longing for the material, belong to this region of the mind. The \"lust of the flesh; the lust of the eyes; the pride of life,\" belong to the Instinctive Mind.  Take note, however, that we are not condemning the things belonging to this plane of the mind. All of them have their place--many were necessary in the past, and many are still necessary for the continuance of physical life. All are right in their place, and to those in the particular plane of development to which they belong, and are wrong only when one is mastered by them, or when he returns to pick up an unworthy thing that has been cast off in the unfoldment of the individual. This lesson has nothing to do with the right and wrong of these things (we have treated of that elsewhere) and we mention this part of the mind that you may understand that you have such a thing in your mental make-up, and that you may understand the thought, etc., coming from it, when we start in to analyze the mind in the latter part of this lesson. All we will ask you to do at this stage of the lesson is to realize that this part of the mind, while _belonging_ to you, is _not_ You, yourself. It is _not_ the \"I\" part of you.  Next in order, above the Instinctive Mind, is what we have called the Intellect, that part of the mind that does our reasoning, analyzing; \"thinking,\" etc. You are using it in the consideration of this lesson. But note this: You are _using_ it, but it is _not_ You, any more than was the Instinctive Mind that you considered a moment ago. You will begin to make the separation, if you will think but a moment. We will not take up your time with a consideration of Intellect or Reason. You will find a good description of this part of the mind in any good elementary work on Psychology. Our only idea in mentioning it is that you may make the classification, and that we may afterward show you that the Intellect is but a tool of the Ego, instead of being the real \"I\" itself, as so many seem to imagine.  The third, and highest, Mental Principle is what is called the Spiritual Mind, that part of the mind which is almost unknown to many of the race, but which has developed into consciousness with nearly all who read this lesson, for the fact that the subject of this lesson attracts you is a proof that this part of your mental nature is unfolding into consciousness. This region of the mind is the source of that which we call \"genius,\" \"inspiration,\" \"spirituality,\" and all that we consider the \"highest\" in our mental make-up. All the great thoughts and ideas float into the field of consciousness from this part of the mind. All the great unfoldment of the race comes from there. All the higher mental ideas that have come to Man in his upward evolutionary journey, that tend in the direction of nobility; true religious feeling; kindness; humanity; justice; unselfish love; mercy; sympathy, etc., have come to him through his slowly unfolding Spiritual Mind. His love of God and of his fellow man have come in this way. His knowledge of the great occult truths reach him through this channel. The mental realization of the \"I,\" which we are endeavoring to teach in these lessons, must come to him by way of the Spiritual Mind unfolding its ideas into his field of consciousness.  But even this great and wonderful part of the mind is but a tool--a highly finished one, it is true, but still a tool--to the Ego, or \"I.\"  We propose to give you a little mental drill work, toward the end that you may be able more readily to distinguish the \"I\" from the mind, or mental states. In this connection we would say that every part, plane, and function of the mind is good, and necessary, and the student must not fall into the error of supposing that because we tell him to set aside first this part of the mind and then that part, that we are undervaluing the mind, or that we regard it as an encumbrance or hindrance. Far from this, we realize that it is _by the use of_ the mind that Man is enabled to arrive at a knowledge of his true nature and Self, and that his progress through many stages yet will depend upon the unfolding of his mental faculties.  Man is now using but the lower and inferior parts of his mind, and he has within his mental world great unexplored regions that far surpass anything of which the human mind has dreamed. In fact, it is part of the business of \"Raja Yoga\" to aid in unfolding these higher faculties and mental regions. And so far from decrying the Mind, the \"Raja Yoga\" teachers are chiefly concerned in recognizing the Mind's power and possibilities, and directing the student to avail himself of the latent powers that are inherent in his soul.  It is only by the mind that the teachings we are now giving you may be grasped and understood, and used to your advantage and benefit. We are talking direct to your mind now, and are making appeals to it, that it may be interested and may open itself to what is ready to come into it from its own higher regions. We are appealing to the Intellect to direct its attention to this great matter, that it may interpose less resistance to the truths that are waiting to be projected from the Spiritual Mind, which knows the Truth.   MENTAL DRILL.  Place yourself in a calm, restful condition, that you may be able to meditate upon the matters that we shall place before you for consideration. Allow the matters presented to meet with a hospitable reception from you, and hold a mental attitude of willingness to receive what may be waiting for you in the higher regions of your mind.  We wish to call your attention to several mental impressions or conditions, one after another, in order that you may realize that they are merely something _incident_ to you, and _not_ YOU yourself--that you may set them aside and consider them, just as you might anything that you have been using. You cannot set the \"I\" aside and so consider it, but the various forms of the \"not I\" may be so set aside and considered.  In the First Lesson you gained the perception of the \"I\" as independent from the body, the latter merely being an instrument for use. You have now arrived at the stage when the \"I\" appears to you to be a mental creature--a bundle of thoughts, feelings, moods, etc. But you must go farther. You must be able to distinguish the \"I\" from these mental conditions, which are as much tools as is the body and its parts.  Let us begin by considering the thoughts more closely connected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],["title","A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#5)"],["body","the body, and then work up to the higher mental states.  The sensations of the body, such as hunger; thirst; pain; pleasurable sensations; physical desires, etc., etc., are not apt to be mistaken for essential qualities of the \"I\" by many of the Candidates, for they have passed beyond this stage, and have learned to set aside these sensations, to a greater or lesser extent, by an effort of the Will, and are no longer slaves to them. Not that they do not experience these sensations, but they have grown to regard them as incidents of the physical life--good in their place--but useful to the advanced man only when he has mastered them to the extent that he no longer regards them as close to the \"I.\" And yet, to some people, these sensations are so closely identified with their conception of the \"I\" that when they think of themselves they think merely of a bundle of these sensations. They are not able to set them aside and consider them as things apart, to be used when necessary and proper, but as things not fastened to the \"I.\" The more advanced a man becomes the farther off seem these sensations. Not that he does not feel hungry, for instance. Not at all, for he recognizes hunger, and satisfies it within reason, knowing that his physical body is making demands for attention, and that these demands should be heeded. But--mark the difference--instead of feeling that the \"_I_\" is hungry the man feels that \"_my body_\" is hungry, just as he might become conscious that his horse or dog was crying for food insistently. Do you see what we mean? It is that the man no longer identifies himself--the \"I\"--with the body, consequently the thoughts which are most closely allied to the physical life seem comparatively \"separate\" from his \"I\" conception. Such a man thinks \"my stomach, this,\" or \"my leg, that,\" or \"my body, thus,\" instead of \"'I,' this,\" or \"'I' that.\" He is able, almost automatically, to think of the body and its sensations as things _of_ him, and _belonging to_ him, which require attention and care, rather than as real parts of the \"I.\" He is able to form a conception of the \"I\" as existing without any of these things--without the body and its sensations--and so he has taken the first step in the realization of the \"I.\"  Before going on, we ask the students to stop a few moments, and mentally run over these sensations of the body. Form a mental image of them, and realize that they are merely incidents to the present stage of growth and experience of the \"I,\" and that they form no real part of it. They may, and will be, left behind in the Ego's higher planes of advancement. You may have attained this mental conception perfectly, long since, but we ask that to give yourself the mental drill at this time, in order to fasten upon your mind this first step.  In realizing that you are able to set aside, mentally, these sensations--that you are able to hold them out at arm's length and \"consider\" them as an \"outside\" thing, you mentally determine that they are \"not I\" things, and you set them down in the \"not I\" collection--the first to be placed there. Let us try to make this still plainer, even at the risk of wearying you by repetitions (for you must get this idea firmly fixed in your mind). To be able to say that a thing is \"not I,\" you must realize that there are two things in question (1) the \"not I\" thing, and (2) the \"I\" who is regarding the \"not I\" thing just as the \"I\" regards a lump of sugar, or a mountain. Do you see what we mean? Keep at it until you do.  Next, consider some of the emotions, such as anger; hate; love, in its ordinary forms; jealousy; ambition; and the hundred and one other emotions that sweep through our brains. You will find that you are able to set each one of these emotions or feelings aside and study it; dissect it; analyze it; consider it. You will be able to understand the rise, progress and end of each of these feelings, as they have come to you, and as you recall them in your memory or imagination, just as readily as you would were you observing their occurrence in the mind of a friend. You will find them all stored away in some parts of your mental make-up, and you may (to use a modern American slang phrase) \"make them trot before you, and show their paces.\" Don't you see that they are not \"You\"--that they are merely something that you carry around with you in a mental bag. You can imagine yourself as living without them, and still being \"I,\" can you not?  And the very fact that you are able to set them aside and examine and consider them is a proof that they are \"not I\" things--for there are two things in the matter (1) _You_ who are examining and considering them, and (2) the thing itself which is the _object_ of the examination and consideration at mental arm's length. So into the \"not I\" collection go these emotions, desirable and undesirable. The collection is steadily growing, and will attain quite formidable proportions after a while.  Now, do not imagine that this is a lesson designed to teach you how to discard these emotions, although if it enables you to get rid of the undesirable ones, so much the better. This is not our object, for we bid you place the desirable (at this time) ones in with the opposite kind, the idea being to bring you to a realization that the \"I\" is higher, above and independent of these mental somethings, and then when you have realized the nature of the \"I,\" you may return and use (as a Master) the things that have been using you as a slave. So do not be afraid to throw these emotions (good and bad) into the \"not I\" collection. You may go back to them, and use the good ones, after the Mental Drill is over. No matter how much you may think that you are bound by any of these emotions, you will realize, by careful analysis, that it is of the \"not I\" kind, for the \"I\" existed before the emotion came into active play, and it will live long after the emotion has faded away. The principal proof is that you are able to hold it out at arm's length and examine it--a proof that it is \"not I.\"  Run through the entire list of your feelings; emotions; moods; and what not, just as you would those of a well-known friend or relative, and you will see that each one--every one--is a \"not I\" thing, and you will lay it aside for the time, for the purpose of the scientific experiment, at least.  Then passing on to the Intellect, you will be able to hold out for examination each mental process and principle. You don't believe it, you may say. Then read and study some good work on Psychology, and you will learn to dissect and analyze every intellectual process--and to classify it and place it in the proper pigeon-hole. Study Psychology by means of some good text-book, and you will find that one by one every intellectual process is classified, and talked about and labeled, just as you would a collection of flowers. If that does not satisfy you, turn the leaves of some work on Logic, and you will admit that you may hold these intellectual processes at arm's length and examine them, and talk about them to others. So that these wonderful tools of Man--the Intellectual powers may be placed in the \"not I\" collection, for the \"I\" is capable of standing aside and viewing them--it is able to detach them from itself. The most remarkable thing about this is that in admitting this fact, you realize that the \"I\" is using these very intellectual faculties to pass upon themselves. Who is the Master that compels these faculties to do this to themselves? The Master of the Mind--The \"I.\"  And reaching the higher regions of the mind--even the Spiritual Mind, you will be compelled to admit that the things that have come into consciousness from that region may be considered and studied, just as may be any other mental thing, and so even these high things must be placed in the \"not I\" collection. You may object that this does not prove that all the things in the Spiritual Mind may be so treated--that there may be \"I\" things there that can not be so treated. We will not discuss this question, for you know nothing about the Spiritual Mind except as it has revealed itself to you, and the higher regions of that mind are like the mind of a God, when compared to what _you_ call mind. But the evidence of the Illumined--those in whom the Spiritual Mind has wonderfully unfolded tell us that even in the highest forms of development, the Initiates, yea, even the Masters, realize that above even their highest mental states there is always that eternal \"I\" brooding over them, as the Sun over the lake; and that the highest conception of the \"I\" known even to advanced souls, is but a faint reflection of the \"I\" filtering through the Spiritual Mind, although that Spiritual Mind is as clear as the clearest crystal when compared with our comparatively opaque mental states. And the highest mental state is but a tool or instrument of the \"I,\" and is not the \"I\" itself.  And yet the \"I\" is to be found in the faintest forms of consciousness, and animates even the unconscious life. The \"I\" is always the same, but its apparent growth is the result of the mental unfoldment of the individual. As we described it in one of the lessons of the \"_Advanced Course_\" it is like an electric lamp that is encased in many wrappings of cloth. As cloth after cloth is removed, the light seems to grow brighter and stronger, and yet it has changed not, the change being in the removal of the confining and bedimming coverings. We do not expect to make you realize the \"I\" in all its fullness--that is far beyond the highest known to man of to-day--but we do hope to bring you to a realization of the highest conception of the \"I,\" possible to each of you in your present stage of unfoldment, and in the process we expect to cause to drop from you some of the confining sheaths that you have about outgrown. The sheaths are ready for dropping, and all that is required is the touch of a friendly hand to cause them to fall fluttering from you."]]]
