The ideals he held up were not new or strange, but old, well-tried, one might almost say conventional. They represent the ideals which, in the friction and turmoil of ages, have emerged as definite, clear, final. They are not disputed or dubious notions, but accepted truisms forgotten and neglected, waiting for the day when men shall live by them.  Furthermore, Watts was not in any sense a mystic--neither personally or as an artist. \"The Dweller in the Innermost\" is not the transcendental self known to a few rare souls, but is merely conscience, known to all. The biblical paintings have no secret meaning assigned to them. The inhabitants of Eden, the hero of the Deluge, the Hebrew patriarchs, Samson and Satan--all these are the familiar figures of the evangelical's Bible. \"Eve Repentant\" is the woman Eve, the mother of the race; \"Jacob and Esau\" are the brothers come to reconciliation; \"Jonah\" is the prophet denouncing the Nineveh of his day and the Babylon of this. The teaching--and there is teaching in every one of them--is plain and ethical. So also, with the Greek myths; they teach plainly--they hold no esoteric interpretations. Watts is no Neo-Platonist weaving mystical doctrines from the ancient hero tales; he is rather a stoic, a moralist, a teacher of earthly things.  But we must be careful to guard against the impression of Watts as a lofty philosopher consciously issuing proclamations by means of his art. Really he was not aware of being a philosopher at all; he was simply an artist, an exquisitely delicate and sensitive medium, who, when once before his canvas, suddenly filled with his idea, was compelled to say his word. If there be any synthesis about his finished work--and no one can deny this--it was not because Watts gave days and nights and years to \"thinking things out.\" His paintings are, as he used to call them, \"anthems,\" brought forth by the intuitive man, the musician. This was the fundamental Watts. Whatever unity there be, is due rather to unity of inspiration than to strength or definiteness of character and accomplishment, and this was sometimes referred to by Watts as a golden thread passing through his life--a thread of good intention--which he felt would guide him through the labyrinth of distractions, mistakes, irritations, ill health, and failures.  One of the striking incidents in the life of Watts was his offer to decorate Euston Railway Station with frescoes entitled \"The Progress of Cosmos.\" \"Chaos\" we have in the Tate Gallery, full of suggestiveness and interest. We see a deep blue sky above the distant mountains, gloriously calm and everlasting; in the middle distance to the left is a nebulous haze of light, while in the foreground the rocks are bursting open and the flames rush through. Figures of men, possessed by the energy and agony of creation, are seen wrestling with the elements of fire and earth. One of these figures, having done his work, floats away from the glow of the fire across the transparent water, while others of his creative family have quite passed the struggling stage of movement and are reclining permanent and gigantic to the right of the picture. The same idea is repeated in the chain of draped women who are emerging from the watery deep; at first they are swept along in isolation, then they fly in closer company, next they dance and finally walk in orderly procession. But Chaos, for all this, is a unity; of all material forms it is the most ancient form; Cosmos however is the long-drawn tale beginning with the day when \"The Spirit of God brooded on the face of the waters.\" Cosmos might have been Watts' synthetic pictorial philosophy; Herbert Spencer with his pen, and he with his brush, as it were, should labour side by side. But this was not to be; the Directors of the North-Western Railway declined the artist's generous offer, and he had to get his \"Cosmos\" painted by degrees. On the whole, perhaps, we should be thankful that the railway company liberated Watts from this self-imposed task. We remember that Dante in his exile set out to write \"Il Convivio,\" a Banquet of so many courses that one might tremble at the prospect of sitting down to it; the four treatises we have are interesting, though dry as dust; but if Dante had finished his Banquet, he might never have had time for his \"Divine Comedy\"; so perhaps, after all, we shall be well content to be without Watts' \"Cosmos,\" remembering what we have gained thereby. Besides, the continuous and spontaneous self-revelation of an artist or a poet is sometimes truer than a rigid predetermined plan.  [Illustration: PLATE IV.--THOMAS CARLYLE  (At the South Kensington Museum)       This canvas was painted in 1868, and is the earlier of the two      portraits of the famous historian painted by Watts. It formed      part of the Foster Bequest. It is interesting to compare this      with the painting in the National Portrait Gallery.]  A few words from the pen of the artist, appearing by way of preface to a book, \"A Plain Handicraft,\" may here be quoted to indicate the strong views Watts took on the \"Condition-of-England Question.\" His interest in art was not centred in painting, or sculpture, or himself, or his fellow artists. He believed in the sacred mission of art as applied to profane things. We see how closely he adheres to the point of view made so famous by Ruskin. Both Watts and Ruskin, one feels, belong rather to the days of Pericles, when everything was best in the state because the citizens gave themselves up to it and to each other. Writing of the necessity and utility of reviving Plain Handicrafts among the mass of the people, the painter of \"Mammon\" says:       \"... When the object is to vitalise and develop faculties--the      especial inheritance of the human race, but strangely dormant      in our time among the largest section of the community--the      claim becomes one that cannot be ignored. Looking at the      subject from a point of view commanding a wide horizon, it      seems to be nothing less than a social demand, rising into a      religious duty, to make every endeavour in the direction of      supplying all possible compensating consolation for the      routine of daily work, become so mechanical and dreary. When      home is without charm, and country without attaching bonds,      the existence of a nation is rudely shaken; dull discontent      leading to sullen discontent, may readily become active      animosity. There will not be men interested in the maintenance      of law and order, who feel that law and order bring them no      perceptible formal advantage. In the race for wealth, it has      been forgotten that wealth alone can offer neither dignity nor      permanent safety; no dignity, if the man of the population is      degraded by dull toil and disgraceful competition; no safety,      if large numbers drag on a discontented existence, while the      more active and intelligent leave our shores.       \"Whether or not our material wealth is to be increased or      diminished, it is certain that a more general well-being and      contentment must be striven for. A happy nation will be a      wealthy nation, wealthy in the best sense, in the assurance      that its children can be depended upon in case of need, wealth      above the fortune of war, and safety above the reach of      fortune. The rush of interest in the direction of what are      understood as worldly advantages, has trampled out the sense      of pleasure in the beautiful, and the need of its presence as      an element essential to the satisfaction of daily life, which      must have been unconsciously felt in ages less absorbed in      acquiring wealth for itself alone. In olden times our art      congresses would have been as needless as congresses to      impress on the general mind the advantages of money-making      would be in these.\" (_Plain Handicraft_, 1892.)  In G.F. Watts, however, we have an instance of a man who, although he sees and is attracted by abstract principles of ethics, does not perceive the manner of their final application; he is not really scientific. It might be thought that the painter of \"Greed and Toil,\" \"The Sempstress,\" \"Mammon,\" \"The Dweller of the Innermost,\" and \"Love Triumphant,\" would be able to indicate, in that sphere of social activity called \"practical politics,\" how these principles could find their expression and realisation. It is interesting, however, to know, and to have it authoritatively from his own pen, that Watts at least could not discern either the time or the application of these ethical principles to the affairs of the great world; for in 1901 there appeared from his hand a quasi-philosophical defence of the South African War, entitled \"Our Race as Pioneers.\" He said:       \"Inevitable social and political measures claim obedience,      which may be at variance with the spiritual and ethical      conscience; but there comes in the question of necessity,      apparent laws that contest with pure right and wrong; ... and      as we must live, nothing remains but commerce; and commerce      cannot be carried on without competition, and pushing the      limits of our interests. The result of competition can only be      conflict--war, unless some other outlet can be found. Commerce      will not supply this; its very activity, which is its health      and life, will produce the ambition, envy, and jarring      interests that will be fatal to peace.... The principle,      _Movement_, must have its outlet, its safety valve. This has      always been war.... The goddess Trade, the modern Pandora, has      in her box all the evils that afflict mankind.... How can      Commerce, as understood by the principles of trade, abolish      war?\"       \"The simple principles of right and wrong are easily      defined,\" and perhaps easily painted; \"but the complexity of      human affairs and legitimate interests, conducing to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13477"],["title","Watts (1817-1904) (#3)"],["body","demanded by the great law, _Movement_, makes some      elasticity necessary, even where there is the most honest      desire to be just.\"  Thus, from his own words, we see how the painter transcends the politician; he is a stimulator, he gives hints, not instructions; he is commanding, imperative, but he does not show how, nor stay to devise ways and means. He even perceives, as he thinks, that though the commands of his pictures, \"Faith,\" \"Conscience,\" and \"Love Triumphant,\" be given, yet they cannot be obeyed fully because of \"Evolution\" and \"Destiny,\" or as he calls it \"Movement.\"  To his intimate friends Watts, who was so introspective, often complained of \"the duality of my nature.\" In the midst of affairs, financial or worldly, on questions of criticism, personal conduct and the like, the great artist was variable and uncertain. Though humble and self-deprecatory to an extreme degree, he made mistakes from which he could escape only with great difficulty; and he suffered much from depression and melancholy. This man, however, never appears in the pictures; when once in his studio, alone facing his canvas, Watts is final, absolute, an undisturbed and undistracted unity, conscious of that overwhelming \"rightness\" known to a Hebrew prophet. Whatever Time or Death may have in store for him or any man, there riding swiftly above them is Judgment the Absolute One; whatever theories may be spun from the perplexed mind of the magazine writer about Expansion and Necessity, there sits the terrible \"Mammon\" pilloried for all time. Indeed, he said his pictures were \"for all time\"; they were from the mind and hand of the seer, who, rising from his personality, transcended it; and as the personality of dual nature gradually fades away into the forgotten past, the Messenger emerges ever more and more clearly, leaving his graphic testimonies spread out upon a hundred canvases. It might be said as a final estimate that the value and sincerity of Watts' work becomes intensified a hundred-fold when we remember that its grandeur and dignity, its unity and its calm, was the work of a man who seldom, if ever, attained internal peace. Like some who speak wiser than they know, so Watts gave himself as an instrument to inspirations of which he was not able, through adverse circumstances, to make full use. Thus was the Man divided from the Messenger.  [Illustration: PLATE V.--LOVE AND LIFE  (At the Tate Gallery)       Love, strong in his immortal youth, leads Life, a slight      female figure, along the steep uphill path; with his broad      wings he shelters her, that the winds of heaven may not visit      her too roughly. Violets spring where Love has trod, and as      they ascend to the mountain top the air becomes more and more      golden. The implication is that, without the aid of Divine      Love, fragile Human Life could not have power to ascend the      steep path upward. First exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in      1885. Companion picture to \"Love and Death,\" and \"Love      Triumphant.\"]     III  A REVIEW OF WATTS' WORK   Failing the \"Progress of the Cosmos,\" we have from the mind and brush of Watts a great number of paintings, which may be grouped according to their character. Such divisions must not be regarded as rigid or official, for often enough a picture may belong to several groups at the same time. For the purpose of our survey, however, we divide them as follows:       1. Monumental or Historical Paintings and Frescoes.      2. Humanitarian or Social Paintings.      3. Portraits, private and public.      4. Biblical Paintings.      5. Mythical Paintings.      6. \"Pessimistic\" Paintings.      7. The Great Realities.      8. The Love Series.      9. The Death Series.      10. Landscapes.      11. Unclassified Paintings.      12. Paintings of Warriors.  \"Caractacus\" was the first of the monumental paintings; by them Watts appears as a citizen and a patriot, whose insular enthusiasm extends backward to the time when the British chief Caractacus fought and was subdued by the Romans. He enters also into the spirit of the resistance offered to the Danes by King Alfred. George and the Dragon are included by him in the historical though mythical events of our race. Undoubtedly the most remarkable of Watts' monumental paintings is the fresco entitled \"Justice; a Hemicycle of Lawgivers,\" painted for the Benchers' Hall in Lincoln's Inn. It is 45 x 40 feet. Here Watts, taking the conventional and theoretical attitude, identifies law-making with justice, and in his fresco we see thirty-three figures, representing Moses, Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Confucius, Lycurgus and his fellow-Greeks, Numa Pompilius and other Romans. Here figures also Justinian, the maker of the great Code; Mahomet, King Alfred, and even Attila the Hun. The painting represents the close of this phase of Watts' work; he received a gift of £500 and a gold cup in memory of its achievement. In England, at least, no one has ever attempted or accomplished anything in fresco of so great dimensions. Watts' monumental genius drove him to sculpture on the grand scale also. \"Hugh Lupus\" for the Duke of Westminster, and \"Physical Energy,\" upon which he laboured at intervals during twenty-five years of his life, are his great triumphs in this direction. It is not the first time that an artist deficient in health and strength has made physical energy into a demigod. Men often, perhaps always, idealise what they have not. It was the wish of the sculptor to place a cast of \"Physical Energy\" on the grave of Cecil Rhodes on the Matoppo Hills in South Africa, indicating how Watts found it possible (by idealising what he wished to idealise), to include within the scope and patronage of his art, the activities, aims, and interests of modern Colonial Enterprise.  _Humanitarian Paintings_.--The earliest of these, \"The Wounded Heron,\" asks our pity for the injured bird, and forbids us to join in the enthusiasm of the huntsman who hurries for his suffering prize. The same thought is expressed in the beautiful \"Shuddering Angel,\" who is covering his face with his hands at the sight of the mangled plumage scattered on the altar of fashion. In the large canvases, \"A Patient Life of Unrequited Toil,\" and \"Midday Rest,\" we have paintings of horses, both of them designed to teach us consideration for the \"friend of man.\" \"The Sempstress\" sings us Tom Hood's \"Song of the Shirt.\"  \"The Good Samaritan\" (see Plate VII.) properly belongs to this series. It was presented by the artist to the citizens of Manchester, as an expression of his admiration of Thomas Wright, the prison philanthropist, whose work was at that time (1852) creating a sensation in the north of England. If we compare this painting with other Biblical subjects executed at a later date, we see how much Watts' work has gained since then. The almost smooth texture and the dark shadows of the Manchester picture have given way to ruggedness and transparency. Still, \"The Good Samaritan\" is simple and excellent in purpose and composition.  A little known painting entitled \"Cruel Vengeance,\" seems to be a forecast of \"Mammon\"; a creature with human form and vulture's head presses under his hand a figure like the maiden whose head rests on Mammon's knee. In \"Greed and Labour\" the seer's eye pierces through the relations between the worker and his master; Labour is a fine strong figure loaded with the implements of his toil, with no feeling of subjection in his manly face; on the other hand, the miser creeping behind him, clutching the money bags, represents that Greed who, as Mammon, is seen sitting on his throne of death. \"Mammon\" is, however, the greatest of the three, containing in itself the ideas and forms of the other two. It is a terrible picture of the god to whom many bow the knee--\"dedicated to his worshippers.\" His leaden face shows a consciousness of power, but not happiness arising from power; his dull eyes see nothing, though his mind's eye sees one thing clearly--the money bags on his lap. The two frail creatures of youth and maiden, \"types of humanity\" as Watts said, are crushed by his heavy limbs, while behind a fire burns continuously, perhaps also within his massive breast.  _Portraits_.--In portraiture, as in other forms of art, Watts had distinct and peculiar views. He gradually came to the opinion, which he adopted as his first rule in portraiture, that it was his duty, not merely to copy the external features of the sitter, but to give what might be called an intellectual copy. He declared it to be possible and necessary for the sitter and painter to attain a unity of feeling and a sympathy, by which he (the painter) was inspired. Watts' earlier portraits, while being far from characterless, are not instances of the application of this principle. There is in them a slight tendency to eighteenth-century ideal portraiture, which so often took the sitter (and the observer too) back to times and attitudes, backgrounds and thunderstorms, that never were and never will be.  Watts, however, was slightly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite school. He might, had he wished, have been their portrait painter--and indeed, the picture of the comely Mrs. Hughes, a kind, motherly creature, with a background of distant fields, minutely painted, is quite on the lines of Pre-Raphaelite realism.  [Illustration: PLATE VI.--LOVE TRIUMPHANT  (At the Tate Gallery)       Time and Death having travelled together through the ages,      have run their course and are at length overthrown. Love alone      arises on immortal wings, triumphantly, with outspread arms to      the eternal skies.       Given to the nation in 1900.]  Somewhat of the same character is the portrait of Mrs. Nassau Senior, who, with one knee on a sofa, is shown tending flowers, her rippling golden hair falling over her shoulders. A full-length portrait of Miss Mary Kirkpatrick Brunton, dated 1842, also belongs to the old style. Watts had a passion for human"]]]
