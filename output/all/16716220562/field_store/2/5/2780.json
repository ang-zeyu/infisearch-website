When the clarion's music thrills     To the hearts of these lone hills,     When the spear in conflict shakes,     And the strong lance shivering breaks.     \"Take thy banner! and, beneath     The battle-cloud's encircling wreath,     Guard it, till our homes are free!     Guard it!  God will prosper thee!     In the dark and trying hour,     In the breaking forth of power,     In the rush of steeds and men,     His right hand will shield thee then.      \"Take thy banner!  But when night      Closes round the ghastly fight,      If the vanquished warrior bow,      Spare him!  By our holy vow,      By our prayers and many tears,      By the mercy that endears,      Spare him! he our love hath shared!      Spare him! as thou wouldst be spared!      \"Take thy banner! and if e'er      Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,      And the muffled drum should beat      To the tread of mournful feet,      Then this crimson flag shall be      Martial cloak and shroud for thee.\"  The warrior took that banner proud, And it was his martial cloak and shroud!    SUNRISE ON THE HILLS    I stood upon the hills, when heaven's wide arch Was glorious with the sun's returning march, And woods were brightened, and soft gales Went forth to kiss the sun-clad vales. The clouds were far beneath me; bathed in light, They gathered mid-way round the wooded height, And, in their fading glory, shone Like hosts in battle overthrown. As many a pinnacle, with shifting glance. Through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance, And rocking on the cliff was left The dark pine blasted, bare, and cleft. The veil of cloud was lifted, and below Glowed the rich valley, and the river's flow Was darkened by the forest's shade, Or glistened in the white cascade; Where upward, in the mellow blush of day, The noisy bittern wheeled his spiral way.    I heard the distant waters dash, I saw the current whirl and flash, And richly, by the blue lake's silver beach, The woods were bending with a silent reach. Then o'er the vale, with gentle swell, The music of the village bell Came sweetly to the echo-giving hills; And the wild horn, whose voice the woodland fills, Was ringing to the merry shout, That faint and far the glen sent out, Where, answering to the sudden shot, thin smoke, Through thick-leaved branches, from the dingle broke.    If thou art worn and hard beset With sorrows, that thou wouldst forget, If thou wouldst read a lesson, that will keep Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep, Go to the woods and hills!  No tears Dim the sweet look that Nature wears.    THE SPIRIT OF POETRY  There is a quiet spirit in these woods, That dwells where'er the gentle south-wind blows; Where, underneath the white-thorn, in the glade, The wild flowers bloom, or, kissing the soft air, The leaves above their sunny palms outspread. With what a tender and impassioned voice It fills the nice and delicate ear of thought, When the fast ushering star of morning comes O'er-riding the gray hills with golden scarf; Or when the cowled and dusky-sandaled Eve, In mourning weeds, from out the western gate, Departs with silent pace!  That spirit moves In the green valley, where the silver brook, From its full laver, pours the white cascade; And, babbling low amid the tangled woods, Slips down through moss-grown stones with endless laughter. And frequent, on the everlasting hills, Its feet go forth, when it doth wrap itself In all the dark embroidery of the storm, And shouts the stern, strong wind.  And here, amid The silent majesty of these deep woods, Its presence shall uplift thy thoughts from earth, As to the sunshine and the pure, bright air Their tops the green trees lift.  Hence gifted bards Have ever loved the calm and quiet shades. For them there was an eloquent voice in all The sylvan pomp of woods, the golden sun, The flowers, the leaves, the river on its way, Blue skies, and silver clouds, and gentle winds, The swelling upland, where the sidelong sun Aslant the wooded slope, at evening, goes, Groves, through whose broken roof the sky looks in, Mountain, and shattered cliff, and sunny vale, The distant lake, fountains, and mighty trees, In many a lazy syllable, repeating Their old poetic legends to the wind.     And this is the sweet spirit, that doth fill The world; and, in these wayward days of youth, My busy fancy oft embodies it, As a bright image of the light and beauty That dwell in nature; of the heavenly forms We worship in our dreams, and the soft hues That stain the wild bird's wing, and flush the clouds When the sun sets.  Within her tender eye The heaven of April, with its changing light, And when it wears the blue of May, is hung, And on her lip the rich, red rose.  Her hair Is like the summer tresses of the trees, When twilight makes them brown, and on her cheek Blushes the richness of an autumn sky, With ever-shifting beauty.  Then her breath, It is so like the gentle air of Spring, As, front the morning's dewy flowers, it comes Full of their fragrance, that it is a joy To have it round us, and her silver voice Is the rich music of a summer bird, Heard in the still night, with its passionate cadence.    BURIAL OF THE MINNISINK  On sunny slope and beechen swell, The shadowed light of evening fell; And, where the maple's leaf was brown, With soft and silent lapse came down, The glory, that the wood receives, At sunset, in its golden leaves.  Far upward in the mellow light Rose the blue hills.  One cloud of white, Around a far uplifted cone, In the warm blush of evening shone; An image of the silver lakes, By which the Indian's soul awakes.  But soon a funeral hymn was heard Where the soft breath of evening stirred The tall, gray forest; and a band Of stern in heart, and strong in hand, Came winding down beside the wave, To lay the red chief in his grave.  They sang, that by his native bowers He stood, in the last moon of flowers, And thirty snows had not yet shed Their glory on the warrior's head; But, as the summer fruit decays, So died he in those naked days.  A dark cloak of the roebuck's skin Covered the warrior, and within Its heavy folds the weapons, made For the hard toils of war, were laid; The cuirass, woven of plaited reeds, And the broad belt of shells and beads.  Before, a dark-haired virgin train Chanted the death dirge of the slain; Behind, the long procession came Of hoary men and chiefs of fame, With heavy hearts, and eyes of grief, Leading the war-horse of their chief.  Stripped of his proud and martial dress, Uncurbed, unreined, and riderless, With darting eye, and nostril spread, And heavy and impatient tread, He came; and oft that eye so proud Asked for his rider in the crowd.  They buried the dark chief; they freed Beside the grave his battle steed; And swift an arrow cleaved its way To his stern heart!  One piercing neigh Arose, and, on the dead man's plain, The rider grasps his steed again.    L' ENVOI  Ye voices, that arose After the Evening's close, And whispered to my restless heart repose!  Go, breathe it in the ear Of all who doubt and fear, And say to them, \"Be of good cheer!\"  Ye sounds, so low and calm, That in the groves of balm Seemed to me like an angel's psalm!  Go, mingle yet once more With the perpetual roar Of the pine forest dark and hoar!  Tongues of the dead, not lost But speaking from deaths frost, Like fiery tongues at Pentecost!  Glimmer, as funeral lamps, Amid the chills and damps Of the vast plain where Death encamps!  ****************  BALLADS AND OTHER POEMS  THE SKELETON IN ARMOR  \"Speak! speak I thou fearful guest  Who, with thy hollow breast  Still in rude armor drest,    Comest to daunt me!  Wrapt not in Eastern balms,  Bat with thy fleshless palms  Stretched, as if asking alms,    Why dost thou haunt me?\"  Then, from those cavernous eyes Pale flashes seemed to rise, As when the Northern skies    Gleam in December; And, like the water's flow Under December's snow, Came a dull voice of woe    From the heart's chamber.  \"I was a Viking old! My deeds, though manifold, No Skald in song has told,    No Saga taught thee! Take heed, that in thy verse Thou dost the tale rehearse, Else dread a dead man's curse;    For this I sought thee.  \"Far in the Northern Land, By the wild Baltic's strand, I, with my childish hand,    Tamed the gerfalcon; And, with my skates fast-bound, Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,    That the poor whimpering hound Trembled to walk on.  \"Oft to his frozen lair Tracked I the grisly bear, While from my path the hare    Fled like a shadow; Oft through the forest dark Followed the were-wolf's bark, Until the soaring lark   Sang from the meadow.  \"But when I older grew, Joining a corsair's crew, O'er the dark sea I flew    With the marauders. Wild was the life we led; Many the souls that sped, Many the hearts that bled,   By our stern orders.  \"Many a wassail-bout Wore the long Winter out; Often our midnight shout   Set the cocks crowing, As we the Berserk's tale Measured in cups of ale, Draining the oaken pail,   Filled to o'erflowing.  \"Once as I told in glee Tales of the stormy sea, Soft eyes did gaze on me,   Burning yet tender; And as the white stars shine On the dark Norway pine, On that dark heart of mine   Fell their soft splendor.  \"I wooed the blue-eyed maid, Yielding, yet half afraid, And in the forest's shade   Our vows were plighted. Under its loosened vest Fluttered her little breast Like birds within their nest   By the hawk frighted.  \"Bright in her father's hall Shields gleamed upon the wall, Loud sang the minstrels all,   Chanting his glory; When of old Hildebrand I asked his daughter's hand, Mute did the minstrels stand   To hear my story.  \"While the brown ale he quaffed, Loud then the champion laughed, And as the wind-gusts waft   The sea-foam brightly, So the loud laugh of scorn, Out of those lips unshorn, From the deep drinking-horn   Blew the foam lightly.  \"She was a Prince's child, I but a Viking wild, And though she blushed and smiled,   I was discarded!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1365"],["title","The Complete Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (#5)"],["body"," Should not the dove so white Follow the sea-mew's flight, Why did they leave that night   Her nest unguarded?  \"Scarce had I put to sea, Bearing the maid with me, Fairest of all was she   Among the Norsemen! When on the white sea-strand, Waving his armed hand, Saw we old Hildebrand,   With twenty horsemen.  \"Then launched they to the blast, Bent like a reed each mast, Yet we were gaining fast,   When the wind failed us; And with a sudden flaw Came round the gusty Skaw, So that our foe we saw   Laugh as he hailed us.  \"And as to catch the gale Round veered the flapping sail, Death I was the helmsman's hail,   Death without quarter! Mid-ships with iron keel Struck we her ribs of steel Down her black hulk did reel   Through the black water!  \"As with his wings aslant, Sails the fierce cormorant, Seeking some rocky haunt   With his prey laden, So toward the open main, Beating to sea again, Through the wild hurricane,   Bore I the maiden.  \"Three weeks we westward bore, And when the storm was o'er, Cloud-like we saw the shore   Stretching to leeward; There for my lady's bower Built I the lofty tower, Which, to this very hour,   Stands looking seaward.  \"There lived we many years; Time dried the maiden's tears She had forgot her fears,   She was a mother. Death closed her mild blue eyes, Under that tower she lies; Ne'er shall the sun arise   On such another!  \"Still grew my bosom then. Still as a stagnant fen! Hateful to me were men,   The sunlight hateful! In the vast forest here, Clad in my warlike gear, Fell I upon my spear,   O, death was grateful!  \"Thus, seamed with many scars, Bursting these prison bars, Up to its native stars   My soul ascended! There from the flowing bowl Deep drinks the warrior's soul, Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!\"   Thus the tale ended.    THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS  It was the schooner Hesperus,    That sailed the wintry sea; And the skipper had taken his little daughter,    To bear him company.  Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,    Her cheeks like the dawn of day, And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,    That ope in the month of May.  The skipper he stood beside the helm,    His pipe was in his month, And he watched how the veering flaw did blow    The smoke now West, now South.  Then up and spake an old Sailor,    Had sailed to the Spanish Main, \"I pray thee, put into yonder port,    For I fear a hurricane.  \"Last night, the moon had a golden ring,    And to-night no moon we see!\" The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,    And a scornful laugh laughed he.  Colder and louder blew the wind,    A gale from the Northeast. The snow fell hissing in the brine,    And the billows frothed like yeast.  Down came the storm, and smote amain    The vessel in its strength; She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,    Then leaped her cable's length.  \"Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,    And do not tremble so; For  I can weather the roughest gale    That ever wind did blow.\"   He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat    Against the stinging blast; He cut a rope from a broken spar,    And bound her to the mast.  \"O father! I hear the church-bells ring,    O say, what may it be?\"  \"'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!\"--    And he steered for the open sea.  \"O father! I hear the sound of guns,    O say, what may it be?\" \"Some ship in distress, that cannot live    In such an angry sea!\"  \"O father! I see a gleaming light    O say, what may it be?\" But the father answered never a word,    A frozen corpse was he.  Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,    With his face turned to the skies, The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow    On his fixed and glassy eyes.  Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed    That saved she might be; And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,    On the Lake of Galilee.  And fast through the midnight dark and drear,    Through the whistling sleet and snow, Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept    Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe.  And ever the fitful gusts between    A sound came from the land; It was the sound of the trampling surf    On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.  The breakers were right beneath her bows,    She drifted a dreary wreck, And a whooping billow swept the crew    Like icicles from her deck.  She struck where the white and fleecy waves    Looked soft as carded wool, But the cruel rocks, they gored her side    Like the horns of an angry bull.  Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,    With the masts went by the board; Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,    Ho! ho! the breakers roared!  At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,    A fisherman stood aghast, To see the form of a maiden fair,    Lashed close to a drifting mast.  The salt sea was frozen on her breast,    The salt tears in her eyes; And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,    On the billows fall and rise.  Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,    In the midnight and the snow! Christ save us all from a death like this,    On the reef of Norman's Woe!    THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH  Under a spreading chestnut-tree   The village smithy stands; The smith, a mighty man is he,   With large and sinewy hands; And the muscles of his brawny arms   Are strong as iron bands.  His hair is crisp, and black, and long,   His face is like the tan; His brow is wet with honest sweat,   He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face,   For he owes not any man.  Week in, week out, from morn till night,   You can hear his bellows blow; You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,   With measured beat and slow, Like a sexton ringing the village bell,   When the evening sun is low.  And children coming home from school   Look in at the open door; They love to see the flaming forge,   And bear the bellows roar, And catch the burning sparks that fly   Like chaff from a threshing-floor.  He goes on Sunday to the church,   And sits among his boys; He hears the parson pray and preach,   He hears his daughter's voice, Singing in the village choir,   And it makes his heart rejoice.  It sounds to him like her mother's voice,   Singing in Paradise! He needs must think of her once more,   How in the grave she lies; And with his hard, rough hand he wipes   A tear out of his eyes.  Toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing,   Onward through life he goes; Each morning sees some task begin,   Each evening sees it close Something attempted, something done,   Has earned a night's repose.  Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus at the flaming forge of life   Our fortunes must be wrought; Thus on its sounding anvil shaped   Each burning deed and thought.    ENDYMION  The rising moon has hid the stars; Her level rays, like golden bars,    Lie on the landscape green,    With shadows brown between.  And silver white the river gleams, As if Diana, in her dreams,    Had dropt her silver bow    Upon the meadows low.  On such a tranquil night as this, She woke Endymion with a kiss,    When, sleeping in the grove,    He dreamed not of her love.  Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought, Love gives itself, but is not bought;    Nor voice, nor sound betrays    Its deep, impassioned gaze.  It comes,--the beautiful, the free, The crown of all humanity,--    In silence and alone    To seek the elected one.  It lifts the boughs, whose shadows deep Are Life's oblivion, the soul's sleep,    And kisses the closed eyes    Of him, who slumbering lies.  O weary hearts! O slumbering eyes! O drooping souls, whose destinies    Are fraught with fear and pain,    Ye shall be loved again!  No one is so accursed by fate, No one so utterly desolate,    But some heart, though unknown,    Responds unto his own.  Responds,--as if with unseen wings, An angel touched its quivering strings;    And whispers, in its song,    \"'Where hast thou stayed so long?\"    IT IS NOT ALWAYS MAY  No hay pajaros en los nidos de antano.                 Spanish Proverb  The sun is bright,--the air is clear,   The darting swallows soar and sing. And from the stately elms I hear   The bluebird prophesying Spring.  So blue you winding river flows,   It seems an outlet from the sky, Where waiting till the west-wind blows,   The freighted clouds at anchor lie.  All things are new;--the buds, the leaves,   That gild the elm-tree's nodding crest,  And even the nest beneath the eaves;--    There are no birds in last year's nest!  All things rejoice in youth and love,    The fulness of their first delight!  And learn from the soft heavens above    The melting tenderness of night.  Maiden, that read'st this simple rhyme,    Enjoy thy youth, it will not stay; Enjoy the fragrance of thy prime,    For oh, it is not always May!  Enjoy the Spring of Love and Youth,    To some good angel leave the rest; For Time will teach thee soon the truth,   There are no birds in last year's nest!    THE RAINY DAY  The day is cold, and dark, and dreary It rains, and the wind is never weary; The vine still clings to the mouldering wall, But at every gust the dead leaves fall,     And the day is dark and dreary.  My life is cold, and dark, and dreary; It rains, and the wind is never weary; My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past, But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,     And the days are dark and dreary.  Be still, sad heart! and cease repining; Behind the clouds is the sun still shining; Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall,     Some days must be dark and dreary.    GOD'S-ACRE.  I like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls   The burial-ground God's-Acre! It is just; It consecrates each grave within its walls,   And breathes a benison o'er the sleeping dust.  God's-Acre! Yes, that blessed name imparts   Comfort to those, who in the grave have sown The seed that they had garnered in their hearts,   Their bread of life, alas! no more their own.  Into its furrows shall we all be cast,  In the sure faith, that we shall rise again At the great harvest, when the archangel's"]]]
