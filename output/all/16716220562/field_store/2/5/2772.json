The four children then entered into conversation with the Blue-Bottle-Flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.  \"Why,\" said Violet, \"would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?\"  To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, \"We found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great- great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. And, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.\"  \"Of course it could not,\" said Slingsby. \"But, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?\"  \"Mainly on oyster-patties,\" said the Blue-Bottle-Fly; \"and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather boiled down to a jelly.\"  \"How delicious!\" said Guy.  To which Lionel added, \"Huzz!\" And all the Blue-Bottle-Flies said, \"Buzz!\"  At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Blue-Bottle-Flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. The Moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.  In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the Quangle-Wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the Pussy-Cat stationed at the helm--the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies, who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.  [Illustration]  As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the Blue-Bottle-Flies; while Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and Epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.  Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies.  Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of Crabs and Crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.  \"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?\" said the four children.  \"Thank you kindly,\" said the Crabs consecutively. \"We are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.\"  On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the Crabs, \"Do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?\"  \"They are all made to unscrew,\" said the Crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which Violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.  After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. \"It does not quite look like a human being,\" said Violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the Quangle-Wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, \"It is the co-operative Cauliflower!\"  [Illustration]  And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.  Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential Cucumbers, and a large number of Waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.  [Illustration]  So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.  [Illustration]  But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.  Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed Apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. Only one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.  What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! In a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.  The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back,--the Quangle-Wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the Pussy-Cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.  [Illustration]  They were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the Rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the Rhinoceros's back. A crowd of Kangaroos and gigantic Cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.  Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],["title","Nonsense Songs (#4)"],["body","t, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.  As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.  [Illustration]     THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES OF THE LAKE PIPPLE-POPPLE.   CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTORY.  In former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the Land of Gramble-Blamble seven families. They lived by the side of the great Lake Pipple-Popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived _in_ the lake), and on the outskirts of the city of Tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see plainly. The names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.  Now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great Lake Pipple-Popple were as follows in the next chapter.   CHAPTER II.  THE SEVEN FAMILIES.  There was a family of two old Parrots and seven young Parrots.  [Illustration]  There was a family of two old Storks and seven young Storks.  [Illustration]  There was a family of two old Geese and seven young Geese.  [Illustration]  There was a family of two old Owls and seven young Owls.  [Illustration]  There was a family of two old Guinea Pigs and seven young Guinea Pigs.  [Illustration]  There was a family of two old Cats and seven young Cats.  [Illustration]  And there was a family of two old Fishes and seven young Fishes.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER III.  THE HABITS OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES.  The Parrots lived upon the Soffsky-Poffsky trees, which were beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.  The Storks walked in and out of the Lake Pipple-Popple, and ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about continually.  The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.  The Owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into sago-puddings.  The Guinea Pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and Cheshire cheese.  The Cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.  The Fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.  And all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.   CHAPTER IV.  THE CHILDREN OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES ARE SENT AWAY.  One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.  So they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.  They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.  \"If,\" said the old Parrots, \"you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.\"  \"And,\" said the old Storks, \"if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.\"  And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, \"Whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.\"  And the old Owls said, \"If you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.\"  And the old Guinea Pigs said, \"Have a care that you eat your lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.\"  And the old Cats said, \"Be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one.\"  And the old Fishes said, \"Above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.\"  So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.    CHAPTER V.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG PARROTS.  The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest Parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. On which all the seven began to fight; and they scuffled,      and huffled,        and ruffled,          and shuffled,            and puffled,              and muffled,                and buffled,                  and duffled,                    and fluffled,                      and guffled,                        and bruffled,                          and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed, and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped, and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident except the cherry and seven small green feathers.  And that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young Parrots.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER VI.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG STORKS.  When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.  About the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.  So, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs should be taken off first. One said this, and another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. And when they saw that he was gone, they began to   chatter-clatter,       blatter-platter,           patter-blatter,               matter-clatter,                   flatter-quatter, more violently than ever; and after they had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.  And that was the end of the seven young Storks.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER VII.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GEESE.  When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.  So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.  Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.  So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each other, \"Beyond all doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding Flea!\"  On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,         \"Plum-pudding Flea,         Plum-pudding Flea,         Wherever you be,         Oh! come to our tree,     And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!\"  And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding Flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.  On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.  So that was the end of the seven young Geese.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER VIII.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG OWLS.  When the seven young Owls set out, they sate every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.  And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.  So they called out, \"Is that a mouse?\"  On which a mouse answered, \"Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!\"  And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.  So that was the end of the seven young Owls.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER IX.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GUINEA PIGS.  The seven young Guinea Pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. When they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. At which they all exclaimed,--     \"Lettuce! O lettuce     Let us, O let us,     O lettuce-leaves,     O let us leave this tree, and eat     Lettuce, O let us, lettuce-leaves!\"  And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.  And that was the end of the seven young Guinea Pigs.  [Illustration]   CHAPTER X.  THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG CATS.  The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more properly written, Clangel-"]]]
