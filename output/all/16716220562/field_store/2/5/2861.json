He went to the extreme point, where from behind the closed railing he could stand as a look-out into the eastern sea. Gently and slowly the vessel rose and fell as it plowed through the long, gleaming undulations.  \"What am I coming to,\" said Chester half-aloud as if the sea might hear and answer him. \"Here I am running away from one heart entanglement only to go plump into another. She is not Julia, of course, but she has Julia's twin soul. A perfect stranger, an acquaintance of two days! The daughter of a minister, a minister of the world!\" What was he thinking of? Who were they? He did not even know her name. She was not a well girl, that he could see. The roses in her cheeks were not altogether natural and her face was pale; but those red lips, and that smile when turned to him! Well, the voyage was half over. Another four or five days and they would be in Liverpool, where they would go their different ways forever. He must keep away from her that long, seeing there was danger. No more playing with the fire that burns so deep. And all this which he seemed to feel and fear, might be undreamed of by her and very likely was. A girl like that would not take seriously a \"steamer friendship.\" She was only doing what all young people do on such trips, making pleasant acquaintances with whom to pass away the monotonous days. \"Sure, sure,\" said he, as if to clinch the argument, but nevertheless, deep within his soul there was an undercurrent of protest against such final conclusions.  Chester tried to seek refuge in Elder Malby, but as he was not to be found, he opened up a conversation with the missionary for Scandinavia. The missionary was but a boy, it seemed to Chester. The going from home and the sea-sickness had had their effects, and the young fellow was glad to have some one to talk to. He came from Arizona, he told Chester; had lived on a ranch all his life; had never been twenty miles away from home before,--and now all this at once! It was \"tough.\"  \"But I'm feeling fine now,\" he said. \"Do you know, I've had a peculiar experience. All the way across the United States from home, something seemed to say to me, 'You can't stand this. You'll go crazy. You'd better go back home.' Of course, I was terribly homesick, and I guess that was the trouble. The cowardly part of me was trying to scare the better part. But all the time I seemed to hear 'You'll go crazy' until once or twice I thought I would.  \"Well, it was the same in New York, and the same when we came aboard. I didn't care much one way or other while sea-sick, but when I got over it, there was the same taunting voice. At last I got downright angry and said, 'All right, I'm going right on and fill my mission, _and go crazy!_' From that moment I have ceased to be bothered, and am now feeling fine.\"  \"Good for you,\" said Chester. \"You'll win out. I wish I was sure about myself.\" He went no further in explanation, however.  Ship board etiquette does not require formal introductions before extended conversations may be carried on. The New England school ma'am and the German professor were in a deep discussion ten minutes after they had met for the first time. Many on the ship were going especially \"to do Europe,\" so there were themes for conversation in common.  As it happened, Chester was alone again that afternoon and he met the minister and his daughter on the promenade deck. They were taking their exercise moderately, pausing frequently to look at any trifling diversion. Chester tipped his cap at them as they passed. At the next meeting in the walk, the minister stopped and greeted the young man.  \"I wish to thank you for your act of kindness to my daughter,\" he said. \"She has told me about it.\"  \"It was nothing, I assure you, sir,\" replied Chester. \"I don't think the fellow will annoy her again.\"  \"I hope not. On these ocean voyages one is thrown so closely into all kinds of company. We, of course, must suppose all our fellow-passengers are respectable people, until we find out otherwise--but let us sit down. Where are our chairs, Lucy?\"  \"They're on the other side, I believe, where we left them this morning.\"  \"It's a little too windy there.\"  \"I'll bring them around to you,\" said Chester. Lucy followed him, pointing out which of the chairs belonged to them.  \"May I not carry one?\" she asked.  \"You do not appear strong enough to lift one.\"  Chester carried the two chairs around to the side of the sheltered deck, then found a vacant chair for himself which he placed with the other two.  \"Thank you very much,\" said the minister, as they seated themselves. \"The day is really fine, isn't it? After the sea-sickness, there is something glorious in a pleasant sea voyage. This is my third time across, but I don't remember just such a fine day as this. Are you a good sailor?\" this to Chester.  \"I've not missed a meal yet, if that's any indication.\"  \"I envy you. I have often wished I could be on deck in a bit of real bad weather. We had a little blow the other day, I understand, when that poor fellow lost his life.\"  \"Yes; I saw the accident,\" replied Chester; whereupon he had to relate the details to them.  \"Well, such is life--and death,\" was the minister's only comment on the story.  The minister did most of the talking. Perhaps that was because he was used to it, having, as he told Chester, been a preacher for twenty-five years. The daughter commented briefly now and then, prompting his memory where it seemed to be weak. Chester listened with great interest to the man's account of former trips to Europe and his description of famous places. The speaker's voice was pleasant and well-modulated. His clean-cut face lighted up under the inspiration of some vivid description. Chester found himself drawn to the man nearly as much as he had been to the daughter.  \"You're an American,\" announced the minister, turning to Chester.  \"Yes.\"  \"A western American, too.\"  \"Right again; how can you tell?\"  \"Easily enough. How far west?\"  \"My home is in Chicago.\"  \"Well, Lucy and I can beat you. We came from Kansas City. Ever been there?\"  \"I've passed through twice.\"  \"Through the Union Depot only?\" asked Lucy.  \"You must have received a very unpleasant impression of our city.\"  \"Well, happily I did get away from that depot. I took a ride on the cars out to Independence, and I saw a good part of the city besides. It's beautiful out towards Swope Park--\"  \"There's where we live,\" exclaimed the girl. \"I think the park's just grand. I live in it nearly all summer.\"  At this point of the conversation, a party to windward, among whom were the two Catholic Fathers, lighted their pipes, and the smoke streamed like from so many chimneys into the faces of those sitting near. The minister looked sharply towards the puffing men, while Lucy tried to push the denser clouds away with her hands; but no notice was taken of such gentle remonstrances.  \"I'll speak to them,\" suggested Chester.  \"No; don't. It would only offend them,\" said the minister. \"They think they are strictly within their rights, and it does not dawn on their nicotine poisoned wits that they are taking away other peoples' rights,--that of breathing the uncontaminated air. We'll just move our chairs a bit,\" which they did.  \"You don't smoke, I take it,\" continued the clergyman, addressing Chester.  \"No; I quit two years ago.\"  \"Good for you. It's a vile habit, and I sometimes think the worst effect smoking has on people is that it dulls the nice gentlemanlyness of a man's character. Now, those men over there, even the Catholic Fathers, are, no doubt gentlemen in all respects but one; it's a pity that the tobacco habit should make the one exception.\"  Chester agreed in words, Lucy in looks.  \"You say you have passed through Kansas City,\" continued the father. \"How far west have you been?\"  \"To the Pacific Coast.\"  \"Lucy and I should have made this trip westward, but the doctor said we must not cross the mountains, because of her heart. So an ocean voyage was advised.\"  \"And I did want so much to see the Rockies,\" added the young woman. \"I have always had a longing to see our own mountains as well as those of Switzerland. Next summer we'll take that western trip.\"  \"I hope so, daughter.\"  \"I assure you they are worth seeing,\" said Chester.  \"No doubt about it. Lucy and I have planned it all for some day. Were you ever in Utah?\"  \"I lived for some time in Salt Lake City. Be sure to see that town on your trip.\"  The minister looked somewhat queerly at Chester for a moment. Then his gaze swept out to the water again as if a momentary disturbing thought was gotten rid of. Lucy was interested.  \"Tell us about Salt Lake City, and, and the Mormons,'\" pleaded she.  \"Never mind the 'Mormons,' Lucy,\" admonished her father.  \"It's difficult to speak of Utah and Salt Lake without mentioning the 'Mormons,'\" added Chester.  \"Then let's talk of something else, something more pleasant.\"  Evidently this minister was like all others, Chester concluded; sane and intelligent on all subjects but one,--the \"Mormons.\" Well, he would set himself right before these two people, and do it now.  \"I can say,\" said Chester, \"that my experience among the 'Mormon' people has been among the most pleasant of my life. In fact, I don't know where I can go to find a more honest, God-fearing, virtuous people. I--\"  \"Young man,\" interrupted the clergyman, looking keenly at him, \"are you a 'Mormon'?\"  \"Yes, sir; I have that honor.\"  Lucy gave a cry, whether of alarm or gladness, the young man could not then tell. The minister arose slowly. \"Lucy,\" he said, \"let us walk a little more,\" and without another word the two resumed their promenade.  But in Lucy's face there appeared concern. The tears, glittering in her eyes did not altogether hide the reassuring glance which she turned about to give Chester as he sat alone by the vacated chairs.     CHAPTER IV.   The next day was Sunday. Even on ship-board"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13756"],["title","Story of Chester Lawrence (#5)"],["body","are some indications that the seventh day is different from the rest. There is always a little extra to the menu for dinner, and then religious services are also held; and are not these two things frequently all that distinguish the Sabbath on the land?  That morning neither Lucy nor her father was at breakfast. Immediately after, Chester sought out the chief steward, and by insistency and the help of a small tip, he got his seat changed to the table occupied by Elder Malby and the two other missionaries. \"No one shall be annoyed by my near presence, if I can help it,\" Chester said.  At the noon meal, the minister and his daughter appeared as usual. Chester watched them unobserved from his changed position. They looked at the vacant place opposite, but as far as Chester could determine, his absence was not discussed.  That afternoon services were held in three parts of the vessel at the same time. On the steerage deck a large company of Irish Catholics surrounded the two Fathers. One of the priests stood in the center of the group while the people kneeled on the deck. The priest read something in Latin, the others repeating after him. Then a glass of \"holy water\" was passed among them, the worshipers dipping their fingers in and devoutly crossing themselves. Chester watched the proceedings for a time, then he went to the second class deck where a revival meeting was in progress. The preacher was delivering the usual exhortation to \"come to Jesus,\" while yet there was time. Presently, there came from the depths of the ship the sound of the dinner gong being slowly and solemnly beaten, no doubt to imitate, as nearly as possible, the peal of church bells. The steward who acted as bell ringer did his duty well, going into the halls and on to the decks, then disappearing again into the saloon. This was the official announcement to service. Chester and his friends followed. Quite a congregation had gathered. Two large pillows had been covered with a Union Jack to serve as a pulpit. A ship's officer then read the form prescribed for services on ship-board from the Church of England prayer book. It was all very dry and uninteresting, \"Verily a form of godliness\" and a lot of \"vain repetition,\" said Elder Malby.  Then the minister--Chester's minister--arose. He had been asked, he said, to add a few words to the regular service, and he was pleased to do so. He called attention to the accident which had happened on their voyage, and felt to say something on the providence of God, and His watch-care over His children. The preacher's voice was pleasant, the ministerial tone not being so pronounced as to make his speech unnatural. Chester listened attentively, as also did Lucy who, Chester observed, was sitting well up towards the front.  \"God is the source of the being of all men,\" said the preacher. \"He has brought us all into existence, and made us in His own likeness, and is a Father to us in fact and in feeling. He owns us and owns His responsibility for us. He cares for us and overrules all things for our good. He is worthy of our love and confidence. Since we are His children, God desires us to be such in very deed--in fellowship and character, and is satisfied with us only as we are giving ourselves to the filial life. This relationship which we bear to God cannot be fully explained. There is a mystery in it beyond the understanding of finite minds; but of this we are sure that the God of Creation has brought us all forth into being, and He will take care of us if we will let Him. We cannot reasonably and reverently think otherwise of Him.  \"Is it not a comfort to think that we cannot get away from the ever-present watchfulness of God? As the Psalmist puts it: 'Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.' Yes, yes, my friends, 'God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear--'\"  Somehow, what the minister said after that came very indistinctly to Chester Lawrence. He heard the words, but was aware only of a peculiar feeling, a dim perception of where he was and what he was hearing. There seemed to him to be a genuine feeling in the voice that uttered those beautiful words of scripture. They clung to his heart, and the minister himself became transfigured for an instant into some other being,--stern of countenance, yet loveliness in the depths of his soul, spiritually far away, yet heart yearning with nearness of love. Chester came fully to himself only when Elder Malby took his arm and together they paced a few turns around the deck.  That same Sunday evening as Chester stood alone on the promenade deck watching the moonlight lay as a golden coverlet on the placid sea, his attention was attracted to the figure of a girl mounting the steps leading to the deck where he stood. She paused half way as if to rest, then came slowly up to where he was standing. Her breath came heavily, and she looked around to find a place to rest. Chester instinctively took her arm and led her to a deck chair.  \"O thank you,\" said Lucy, \"I--my heart bothered me pretty badly that time. I am forbidden to climb stairs, but I couldn't find you on the lower deck.\"  \"Did you wish to see me?\" asked Chester.  \"Yes; I--you'll not think me over bold, will you, but I had to find you--won't you sit down here--I can't talk very loudly tonight.\"  Chester drew a chair close to hers. A light wrap clung about her and the moonlight streamed on head and face. The young man, in the most matter-of-course-way adjusted the wrap to the girl's shoulders as he said:  \"You are not well, tonight.\"  \"Oh, I'm as well as usual--thank you.\" She smiled faintly. \"Will you forgive us?\"  He was about to reply, \"Forgive you for what?\" but he checked himself. Somehow, he could not feign ignorance as to what she meant, neither could he use meaningless words to her.  \"We were very rude to you yesterday, both father and I; and I wanted to make some explanations to you, so you would understand. I am so sorry.\"  \"You and your father are already forgiven. If there were a grain of ill-feeling against him this afternoon, it all completely vanished when I heard him talk at the services.\"  \"You were there?\"  \"Yes. Now don't you worry.\" He was nearly to say \"Little Sister;\" but again he checked himself. \"I am a 'Mormon,'\" he continued. \"I am not ashamed of it, because I know what it means. Only those who don't know despise the word.\"  \"Neither am I ashamed of it,\" she said as she looked him fairly in the face. \"I know a little--a very little--about the 'Mormons,' but that which I know is good.\"  \"What do you know?\"  \"I'll tell you. One evening, in Kansas City I stopped to listen to two young men preaching on the street. They were just boys, and they did not have the appearance of preachers. You must know that I have always been interested in religion, and religious problems. Perhaps that is natural, seeing my father is a minister. I read his books, and many are the discussions I have had with him over points of doctrine,--and we don't always agree, either. He, however, usually took my little objections good naturedly until one day he asked me where I had obtained a certain notion regarding baptism. In reply I handed him the booklet I had received at the 'Mormon' street meeting. He looked at it curiously for a moment, wanted to know where I had obtained it, then locked it up in his desk. He was really angry; as that was something he had never been before over any religious question, I was surprised and impressed. I had, however, read carefully the booklet. Not only that, but I had been secretly to one of the 'Mormon' services. I there learned that an acquaintance of mine belonged to the 'Mormon' Church, and depend upon it, I had her tell me what she knew.\"  \"And your father?\"  \"He objected, of course. At first, I told him everything. He had always let me go to any and all religious gatherings without objection. He even laughingly told me I could don the Salvation lassie's bonnet and beat a drum in the street, if I wanted to; but when it came to the 'Mormons,' O, he was angry, and forbade me from ever going to their meetings or reading their literature. I thought it strange.\"  \"It's not strange at all,--when you understand,\" remarked Chester, who was intensely interested in her story. \"I suppose you obeyed your father.\"  \"Well, now, you want me to tell you the truth, of course--I--I wasn't curious--\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"You're laughing at me. But I wasn't, I tell you. I was interested. There is something in 'Mormonism' that draws me to it. I don't know much about it, to be sure, for it seems that the subject always widens out to such immensity. I want you to tell me more about Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon and the new revelations.\"  \"But your father will object. What would he say if he knew you were sitting here in this beautiful moonlight talking to a 'Mormon'?\"  \"I'm of age, I guess. I'm doing nothing wrong, I hope.\"  \"I hope not. Far be it for me to harm you--or any living soul. But I don't know much about the gospel as we call it--for you must know it is the simple gospel of Jesus Christ revealed anew. There are three other 'Mormons' on board, missionaries going to Europe. One of them at least could tell you much.\"  \"But I'd be pleased to hear you tell me--is, is that father? I wonder if he is looking for me.\"  Chester looked in the direction indicated. A man came up, then passed on; it was not the minister. The girl crouched into the shadow, and as she"]]]
