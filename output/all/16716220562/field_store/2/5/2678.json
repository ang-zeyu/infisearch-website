Patsy himself was dirtier than ever, and much more sullen and gloomy. The traces of tears on his cheeks made my heart leap into my throat. \"Oh, Patsy,\" I exclaimed, \"I am so glad to find you! We expected you all day, and were afraid you weren't well.\"  Not a word of response.  \"We have a chair all ready for you; it is standing right under one of the plant-shelves, and there are three roses in bloom to-day!\"  Still not a word.  \"And I had to tell the dog story without you!\"  The effect of this simple statement was very different from what I had anticipated. I thought I knew what a child was likely to do under every conceivable set of circumstances, but Patsy was destined to be more than once a revelation to me.  He dashed a book of colored advertisements that he held into the farthest corner of the room, threw himself on the floor at full length and beat it with his hands, while he burst into a passion of tears. \"There! there!\" he cried between his sobs, \"I told 'em you'd tell it! I told 'em you'd tell it! I told 'em you'd--but oh, I thought maybe you wouldn't!\" His wails brought Mrs. Kennett from a back piazza where she was washing.  \"Are you the teacher o' the _Kids Guards_, 'm?\"  \"Yes.\" It did not strike me at the time, in my anxiety, what a sympathetic rendering of the German word this was; but we afterwards found that \"Kindergarten\" was thus translated in Anna Street.  \"Patsy couldn't go to-day, 'm, on account of him hevin' no good boots, 'm, Jim not bein' paid off till Wednesday, 'n me hevin' no notice he hed no clean shirt, 'm, this not bein' his clean-shirt week, 'm. He takes it awful hard about that there story, 'm. I told him as how you'd be after tellin' another one next week, but it seems nothin' will comfort him.\"  \"Ev'rybuddy's allers lyin' to me,\" he moaned; \"there warn't another dog picture like that in the hull room!\"  \"Don't take no notice of him, 'm, an' he'll git over it; he's subjick to these spells of takin' on like. Set up, Pat, an' act decent! Tell the lady you'll come when you git your boots.\"  \"Patsy, boy, stop crying a minute and listen to me,\" I said. \"If Mrs. Kennett is willing, I have some things that will fit you; you shall come right back with me now,--all the children have gone,--and you and I will be alone with the sunshine and the birds and the fishes, as we were the other day, and I will tell you the dog story just as I told it to the other children this morning.\"  He got up slowly, rubbed his tattered sleeve across his wet cheek, and looked at me searchingly to see if I might be trusted; then he limped to the sink, treated his face and hands to a hasty but energetic scrub, seized his fragment of a hat, gave his brief trousers a hitch which had the air of being the last exquisite touch to a faultless toilet, and sat down on the landing to mend his twine shoe-lace.  \"Who is your neighbor in Number 32, Mrs. Kennett?\" I asked as I rose to go. \"I went there to find you.\"  \"Did you indeed, 'm? Well, I hope she treated you civil, 'm, though it don't be much in her line. She's a Mis' Mooney, 'm. I know _her_, but she don't know _me_ anny more sence she's riz in the wurrld. She moved out of this house whin I moved into it, but none of us ladies here is good enough for her to 'sociate with _now_, 'm! You see her husband was in the rag, sack, and bottle business, 'm, 'n a wealthy gintleman friend set him up in a fish-cart, an' it's kind of onsettled her, 'm! Some folks can't stan' prosperity. If 't bed bin grad_joo_al like, she might have took it more natcheral; but it come all of a suddent, an' she's that purse-proud now, 'm, that she'll be movin' up on Nob Hill ef she don't hev no stroke o' bad luck to show 'er her place! Good day, 'm!\"  I carved my way through the tin cans and bottles again under the haughty eye of my Duchess of the fish-cart, and in a few minutes Patsy and I were again in Silver Street.  When we entered the room he looked about with an expression of entire content. \"It's all here!\" he said with a sigh, as if he had feared to find it a dream.  The chair with its red cushion pleased him greatly; then, after a few moments' talk to make him feel a little at home, we drew up to the picture, and I took his cleanest hand in mine, and told him the story of Victor, the brave St. Bernard dog.  It was an experience never to be repeated and never to be forgotten!  [Illustration: \"THE STORY OF VICTOR.\"]         *       *       *       *       *  As you sit at twilight in the \"sweet safe corner of the household fire,\" the sound of the raindrops on the window-pane mingling with the laughing treble of childish voices in some distant room, you see certain pictures in the dying flame,--pictures unspeakably precious to every one who has lived, or loved, or suffered.  I have my memory-pictures, too; and from the fairest frame of all shines Patsy's radiant face as it looked into mine long ago when I told him the story of Victor.     CHAPTER VI.  A LITTLE \"HOODLUM'S\" VIRTUE KINDLES AT THE TOUCH OF JOY.       \"If you make children happy now, you will make them happy twenty      years hence by the memory of it.\"   The next morning when I reached the little tin shop on the corner,--a blessed trysting-place, forever sacred, where the children waited for me in sunshine, rain, wind, and storm, unless forbidden,--there on the step sat faithful Patsy, with a clean and shining morning face, all glowing with anticipation. How well I remember my poor lad's first day! Where should I seat him? There was an empty space beside little Mike Higgins, but Mike's character, obtained from a fond and candid parent, had been to the effect \"that he was in heaven any time if he could jest lay a boy out flat\"! And there was a place by Moses, but he was very much of a fop just then, owing to a new \"second-hand\" coat, and might make scathing allusions to Patsy's abbreviated swallow-tail.  But a pull at my skirt and a whisper from the boy decided me.  \"Please can't I set aside o' you, Miss Kate?\"  \"But, Patsy, the fun of it is I never do sit.\"  \"Why, I thought teachers never done nothin' but set!\"  \"You don't know much about little boys and girls, that's sure! Well, suppose you put your chair in front and close to me. Here is Maggie Bruce on one side. She is a real little Kindergarten mother, and will show you just how to do everything. Won't you, Maggie?\"  We had our morning hymn and our familiar talk, in which we always \"outlined the policy\" of the new day; for the children were apt to be angelic and receptive at nine o'clock in the morning, the unwillingness of the spirit and weakness of the flesh seldom overtaking them till an hour or so later. It chanced to be a beautiful day, for Helen and I were both happy and well, our volunteer helpers were daily growing more zealous and efficient, and there was no tragedy in the immediate foreground.  In one of the morning songs, when Paulina went into the circle and threw good-morning kisses to the rest, she wafted a dozen of them to the ceiling, a proceeding I could not understand.  \"Why did you throw so many of your kisses up in the air, dear?\" I asked, as she ran back to my side.  \"Them was good-mornings to Johnny Cass, so 't he wouldn't feel lonesome,\" she explained; and the tender bit of remembrance was followed out by the children for days afterward. Was it not enough to put us in a gentle humor?  Patsy was not equal to the marching when, later on, the Lilliputian army formed itself in line and kept step to the music of a lively tune, and he was far too shy on the first day to join in the play, though he watched the game of the Butterfly with intense interest from his nook by the piano.  After the tiny worm had wriggled itself realistically into a cocoon it went to sleep; and after a moment of dramatic silence, the little one chosen for the butterfly would separate herself from the still cocoon and fly about the circle, sipping mimic honey from the child-flowers.  To see Carlotty Griggs \"being a butterfly,\" with utter intensity of joy and singleness of purpose, was a sight to be remembered. For Carlotty was a pickaninny four years old, and blacker than the Ace of Spades! Her purple calico dress, pink apron, and twenty little woolly braids tied with bits of yellow ribbon made her the most tropical of butterflies; and the children, having a strong sense of color and hardly any sense of humor, were always entirely carried away by her antics.  [Illustration: CARLOTTY GRIGGS \"BEING A BUTTERFLY.\"]  Carlotty had huge feet,--indeed, Carlotty \"toed in,\" for that matter; but her face shone with delight; her eyes glistened, and so did her teeth; and when she waved her ebony hands and flitted among the children, she did it as airily as any real butterfly that ever danced over a field of clover blossoms.  And if Patsy's joy was great in the play, it was greater still in the work that came afterward. When Helen gave him a scarlet and gold mat to weave, his fingers trembled with eagerness; and the expression of his face caused that impulsive young person to fly to my side and whisper, \"Oh, why should one ever 'want to be an angel' when one can be a Kindergartner!\"         *       *       *       *       *  From this time on, Patsy was the first to come in the morning and the last to leave at night. He took the whole institution under his guardianship, and had a watchful eye for everybody and everything belonging to it.  He soon learned the family history of every child in the school, and those family histories, I assure you, were of an exciting nature; but so great were Patsy's prudence and his idea of the proprieties that he never divulged his knowledge till we were alone. Then his tongue would be loosed, and he would break into his half-childlike, half-ancient and reflective conversation.  He had a stormy temper, which, however, he was fast learning to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13506"],["title","The Story of Patsy (#5)"],["body","ol, and he was not always kind and gentle with his little playfellows; for he had been raised in a hard school, and the giving and taking of blows was a natural matter, to him the only feasible manner of settling a misunderstanding.  His conduct to me, however, was touching in its devotion and perfect obedience; and from the first hour he was my poor little knight _sans peur et sans reproche_.  Meanwhile, though not perfect, he was greatly changed for the better. We had given him a neat little coat and trousers, his hair was short and smooth, and his great dark eyes shone with unutterable content. He was never joyous; born under a cloud, he had lived in its shadow, and sorrow too early borne had left its indelible impress, to be removed only by that \"undisturbed vision of the Father's face, which is joy unutterable;\" but for the first time in his life he was at peace.  The Duchess of Anna Street had moved into a house a trifle better suited to her exalted station in life; one where the view was better, and the society worthy of a fish-peddler's family. Accordingly we transferred the Kennetts into Number 32, an honor which they took calmly at first, on account of the odor of fish that pervaded the apartments. The three and four year old Kennetts were now members of our flock, the dull baby was cared for daily by the Infant Shelter, and Mrs. Kennett went out washing; while her spouse upheld the cause of labor by attending sand-lot meetings in the afternoon and marching in the evening.  So, in the rainy winter afternoons, when the other children had gone, Patsy and I stayed together and arranged the next day's occupations. Slang was being gradually eliminated from his conversation; but it is no small task to correct nine years of bad grammar, and I never succeeded in doing it. Alas! the time was all too short.  It was Patsy who sorted the wools and threaded the needles, and set right the sewing-cards of the babies; and only the initiated can comprehend the labyrinthine maze into which an energetic three-year-old can transform a bit of sewing. It was he who fished the needles from the cracks in the floor, rubbed the blackboards, and scrubbed the slates, talking busily the while.  \"Jiminy! (I take that back.) Miss Kate, we can't let Jimmy Buck have no more needles; he sows 'em thick as seed round his chair. Now, now jis' look yere! Ef that Battles chap hain't scratched the hull top of this table with a buzzer! I'd lam him good ef I was you, I would.\"  \"Do you think our Kindergarten would be the pleasant place it is if I whipped little boys every day?\"  \"No-o-o! But there is times\"--  \"Yes, I know, Patsy, but I have never found them.\"  \"Jim's stayin' out nights, this week,\" said he one day, \"'nd I hez to stay along o' Mis' Kennett till nine o'clock.\"  \"Why, I thought Jim always stayed at home in the evening.\"  \"Yes, he allers used ter; but he's busy now lookin' up a girl, don't yer know.\"  \"Looking up a girl! What do you mean, Patsy?\"  Patsy scratched his head with the \"ten-toothed comb of Nature,\"--a habit which prevailed with terrible and suggestive frequency when I first came \"into my kingdom,\"--and answered:--  \"Lookin' up a girl! Why, I s'posed yer knew that. I dunno 'zackly. Jim says all the fellers does. He says he hates to git the feed an' wash the dishes orfly, 'nd girls likes ter do it best of anything.\"  \"Oh!\" cried I, light bursting in upon my darkened intellect when dish-washing was mentioned; \"he wants to get married!\"  \"Well, he has ter look up a girl first, don't yer s'pose?\"  \"Yes, of course; but I don't see how Jim can get money enough to take care of a wife. He only has thirty dollars a month.\"  \"Well, he's goin' ter get a girl what'll 'go halveys,' don't yer know, and pay for her keep. He'd ruther have a 'millingnary' girl--they're the nicest; but if he can't, he's goin' to try for one out of the box factory.\"  \"Oh, Patsy! I wish\"--  \"Why, didn't I ought ter say that?\"  \"I wish you had a mother, dear.\"  \"If I had, I'd know more 'n I do now,\" and a great sigh heaved itself upward from beneath the blue jacket.  \"No, you wouldn't know so much, Patsy, or at least you would get the right end first. Never mind, dear boy, you can't understand.\"  \"Jim says Mis' Kennett 'nd I needn't set such store by you, 'cause the fust chance you gits you'll git married.\" (I always did have an elective antipathy for Jim.) \"Shall yer, Miss Kate?\"  \"Why, dear, I think we are very happy as we are, don't you?\"  \"Yes, ef I could only stay f'rever, 'nd not go ter the reel school. Jim says I ought ter be gittin' book learnin' pretty soon.\"  \"Did you tell him that Miss Helen was teaching you to read and write a little while every afternoon?\"  \"Yes, I told him. He liked it fust rate. Mis' Kennett said she'd let her childern stay f'rever with yer, ef they never larned a thing, 'nd so would I, dear, dear Miss Kate! Oh, I bet God would like to see you in that pretty blue dress!\" and he hung over me with a speechless caress; his first, and last indeed, for he was shy and reticent in emotion, and never once showed his affection in the presence of the other children.  [Illustration: PAULINA'S \"GOOD-MORNINGS TO JOHNNY CASS.\"]     CHAPTER VII.  PATSY FINDS HIS THREE LOST YEARS.      \"Now God be thanked for years enwrought      With love which softens yet.      Now God he thanked for every thought      Which is so tender it has caught      Earth's guerdon of regret.\"   Well, Jim did not succeed in finding his girl, although he \"looked\" industriously. Either the \"millingnaries\" did not smile upon him and his slender bank account, or they were not willing to wash the dishes and halve the financial responsibilities besides; but as the winter days slipped by, we could not help seeing that Patsy's pale face grew paler and his soft dark eyes larger and more pathetic. In spite of better care than he had ever had before, he was often kept at home by suffering all too intense for a child to bear. It was almost as if a sixth sense came to him in those days, so full was he of strange thoughts and intuitions. His eyes followed me wistfully as I passed from one child to another, and when my glance fell upon him, his loving gaze seemed always waiting for mine.  When we were alone, as he pored over picture-books, or sat silently by the window, watching the drops chase each other down the pane, his talk was often of heaven and the angels.  [Illustration: \"HE SAT SILENTLY BY THE WINDOW.\"]  Daga Ohlsen had left us. Her baby eyes had opened under Norway skies, but her tongue had learned the trick of our language when her father and mother could not speak nor understand a word, and so she became a childish interpreter of manners and customs in general. But we knew that mothers' hearts are the same the world over, and, lacking the power to put our sympathy in words, we sent Daga's last bit of sewing to her mother. Sure enough, no word was needed; the message explained itself; and when we went to take a last look at the dear child, the scrap of cardboard lay in the still hand, the needle threaded with yellow wool, the childish knot, soiled and cumbersome, hanging below the pattern just as she had left it. It was her only funeral offering, her only funeral service, and was it not something of a sermon? It told the history of her industry, her sudden call from earthly things, and her mother's tender thought. It chanced to be a symbol, too, as things do chance sometimes, for it was a butterfly dropping its cocoon behind it, and spreading its wings for flight.  Patsy had been our messenger during Daga's illness, and his mind was evidently on that mystery which has puzzled souls since the beginning of time; for no anxious, weary, waiting heart has ever ceased to beat without its passionate desire to look into the beyond.  \"Nixy Jones's mother died yesterday, Miss Kate. They had an orful nice funeral.\"  \"Yes, I'm sorry for the poor little children; they will miss their mamma.\"  \"Not 'nuff to hurt 'em! Them Joneses never cared nuthin' for nobody; they was playing on tin oyster cans the hull blessed ev'nin', till Jim went 'nd stop't 'em, 'nd told 'em it warn't perlite. Say how dretful it must be to go down into the cold, dark ground, and be shut up in a tight box, 'nd want to git out--git out--'nd keep hollerin' 'nd a-hollerin', and nobody come to fetch yer, cause yer's dead!\"  \"Oh, Patsy, child, stop such fearful thoughts! I hope people are glad and willing to stay when they are dead. The part of them that wonders and thinks and feels and loves and is happy or sad--you know what I mean, don't you?\"  \"Yes,\" he said slowly, leaning his head on his hand.  \"God takes care of that part; it is His own, and He makes it all right. And as for our bodies, Patsy, you don't care about keeping your poor little aching back, do you? You talk about the cold, dark earth. Why, I think of it as the tender, warm earth, that holds the little brown acorn until it begins to grow into a spreading oak-tree, and nurses the little seeds till they grow into lovely blossoming flowers. Now we must trot home, Patsy. Wrap this shawl over your shoulders, and come under my umbrella.\"  \"Oh, I don't need any shawl, please. I'm so orful hot!\"  \"That's just the reason,\" I replied, as I looked with anxious eyes at his flushed cheeks.  I left him at the little door on Anna Street, and persuaded Mrs. Kennett to give him some hot soup at dinner-time.  The next morning I was startled from a profound sleep by a tremendous peal of the door-bell. Though only half awakened, my forebodings seemed realized; and the bell rang \"Patsy\" in my ears.  I hastily slipped on my dress, and, going to the door, saw just whom I expected,--Jim.  \"What's the matter with Patsy?\"  \"He's turrible bad, miss; he got took with one o' them fits the worst kind in the night, and liked ter died. Yer could a heerd him screech a block off.\"  \"Oh, my poor boy! Have you had a doctor? What did he say?\"  \"Well, he said he guessed it was the"]]]
