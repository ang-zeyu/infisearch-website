All other crimes appear less atrocious than this scorn of a Saviour's love--this _trampling under foot the blood of the covenant_. While no finite mind could have conceived it possible, that Almighty love should be so slighted, yet the Spirit of prophecy announced this impious ingratitude, long before the incarnation. When Isaiah _saw the glory of Christ, and spake of him_, he also saw that he would be _despised and rejected of men_. And by all their hostility to the doctrines of grace, sinners are only verifying the description, which inspiration gave long ago, of their blindness and perverseness. By all their vain reasonings and presumptuous objections, they just corroborate revealed truth, and evince the desperate wickedness of the natural heart.  As in the days of the apostles, so in this period of increased light, _the preaching of the cross_ is esteemed _foolishness_. The message of redeeming mercy is often received with utter listlessness--often with an evident disgust--and sometimes with an openly avowed hostility. In the apostolic age, it might be supposed that the resistance, with which the Gospel had to contend, arose from the prejudices of a Heathen or Jewish education, and from a very imperfect knowledge of Christianity. But, at the present period, the undiminished hostility, which is displayed against the pure doctrines of redemption, can be attributed to nothing, but that hatred to the ways of God, which the Scriptures represent as rankling in the natural heart, and for which they contain the only remedy.  It requires but a transient view of the religious state, even of enlightened and refined society, to see that to very many, now, _the preaching of the cross is foolishness_. While any temporal interest excites feeling, this theme is listened to with apathy. O, how often are those statements, which fill heaven with ecstasy, rehearsed to vacant, listless hearers! How many weep at fictitious woes, who contemplate the bloody scene of Calvary without a tear! How many hearts glow in admiration of the benevolence or heroism of a fellow worm, while entirely unaffected alike by the sacrifice or the triumph of the Son of God! How often do men express sentiments of the most fervent gratitude towards earthly benefactors, who would be ashamed of uttering one emotion of thanks to Him who _gave himself to die_ for them! And is not this treating the Gospel as _foolishness_? But this heartless unconcern, criminal as it undoubtedly is, in the sight of God, is not so fearfully impious--affords not so appalling a disclosure of depravity, as the absolute disgust and contempt, with which the doctrines of the cross are sometimes received. In almost every community, there are those who utterly despise the whole system--who do not disguise their abhorrence--and who evidently hate the very mention of the subject. How indignant are such at any effort, in private conversation, to urge upon their attention themes connected with the dying love of Christ! How chilling is the effect, when such discourse is attempted, in many circles of refinement and elegance? And what a brand of infamy is affixed to the human character, by the fact, that from most such circles all these topics are absolutely excluded! Let a man confine his conversation to such subjects as engaged the attention of Christ and his apostles--such subjects as now employ the hosts of heaven,--let him be accustomed in company, to bring forward the holy mysteries of redemption,--and by how many would he be shunned like a pestilence? And with what scornful hatred are those churches avoided by many, where nothing is heard but _Jesus Christ and him crucified_? Such are the open, unequivocal expressions of contempt and disgust, with which many treat the doctrines of the cross. Do not _they_ esteem them _foolishness_?  But there is a class of the contemners of evangelical truth, characterized by more active zeal and decided measures. Far from the giddy thoughtlessness of those who hardly reflect upon the subject at all, and from the strange inconsistency of such, as profess to respect what they really despise and hate,--these feel and express a deep interest in religious opinions; devote time and attention to theological studies; and, as the result of their investigations, avow their utter disbelief of the peculiar doctrines of the cross; and undertake to demonstrate their falsehood and absurdity. They tell you, they have maturely examined the whole subject--that they have brought to the investigation all the aid that extensive reading and critical research can furnish--that they have carried the lights of science and philosophy into the dark regions of fanaticism--and have become perfectly convinced, that the whole system is an assemblage of the grossest errors. When, however, the array of argument is produced, its force seems to consist in the unwelcome impressions which the pure Gospel itself makes upon their minds. They can see no wisdom or fitness in such an atonement. They see nothing so very terrible in sin, as to require such an expiation. Pardoning mercy, say they, is one of the natural attributes of Deity; and the doctrine of eternal punishment seems to them too horribly inconsistent with divine justice to bear reflection. As for the substitution of the innocent for the guilty, and satisfying the claims of law by the blood of a sinless victim, they are amazed that any rational man can credit such absurd notions. Tell them of the maladies and wounds of the soul, which can only be healed by the Physician of Calvary--they can hardly conceal their contempt. Tell them plainly, as the Bible does, that they are lost, perishing sinners--that the wrath of God is revealed against them--that the avenging sword is uplifted, and that, unless they fly to the cross and embrace it by a living faith, they must sink to perdition--and you will witness the smile of derision or the frown of indignation. They esteem the doctrine of the Trinity as a monument of human credulity and folly. Their feelings are shocked beyond measure, at the incarnation of Deity, in the person of Jesus Christ. The personality and direct influences of the Holy Spirit appear useless and incredible; and the necessity of a change of heart excites their utter scorn. They cannot endure it. Their disgust is inexpressible.  Instead, therefore, of these offensive principles, they substitute a system, not modelled from the Bible, but from what they consider reason and propriety. This they adorn with all that is beautiful and attractive to the carnal eye. Before this fair and flattering idol, of their own workmanship, they bow down in delighted homage. This is a religion they can love, for it flatters, exalts, and dignifies human nature! But as for human depravity, and other hated doctrines of the orthodox creed, they want words to express their aversion. The simple account of the matter is, that _the preaching of the cross_, in their estimation, _is foolishness_.  Such are the various grades of hostility to the vital principles of the Gospel, from contemptuous indifference, to malignant and rancorous opposition.  We now proceed to enumerate some of the causes, of this deplorable state of feeling towards the _truth as it is in Jesus_.  The depravity--the unholiness--of human nature, may be considered the grand cause of all the enmity which has appeared against the doctrines of grace. It is true, nevertheless, that the various degrees and forms, in which this enmity is manifested, depend upon the peculiarities of individual character and situation.  Destitution of early religious instruction, generally leads to an entire indifference to the whole subject. Persons who are brought up in prayerless, worldly families--whose young minds are not moulded by a pious influence--are usually found very insusceptible of religious impressions. In such hearts the power of ungodliness reigns uncontrolled. Uncultivated and waste, they produce nothing but _thorns and briers_. Nor is it surprising, that this numerous class of the hearers of the Gospel should exhibit an utter disregard and contempt of its authority. _The preaching of the cross is foolishness_ to them, because they do not understand it, and will not take the trouble to examine it.  A similar apathy is frequently observed in persons who have been well instructed, when their whole souls have become engrossed in some worldly pursuit. Their heads and hands are so entirely occupied, that serious reflection is absolutely excluded.  Contempt of evangelical religion is sure to be exhibited in places where its professors are asleep or dead. In communities where real religion flourishes, where its power is felt, and its votaries are consistent and decided; whatever hatred may rankle in the breasts of opposers, they are not apt to indulge in contemptuous derision. But where formality and worldliness prevail, and no conspicuous standard of Christian character is visible--the hearts of sinners will be manifested. They will, without hesitation, avow, in how low and degrading a light they regard the doctrines of the cross. Their contempt and loathing are wholly irrepressible.  In many instances, the pride of rank and intellect is the cause why _the preaching of the cross is_ utterly despised and accounted _foolishness_. The lofty speculations of an aspiring intellect can with difficulty come down to the simplicity of the Gospel. The command, to come to the Saviour's feet with the humility of a little child, fills the proud heart of those _who are wise in their own eyes_, with indignation. They cannot endure doctrines, which level all vain distinctions, and require the noble, the affluent, and the learned, to assume the same station of penitence and contrition, with the lowliest peasant. They cannot consent to lay their honours in the dust, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13824"],["title","The National Preacher, Vol. 2 No. 7 Dec. 1827 (#3)"],["body"," themselves only to sovereign mercies. It is beyond endurance, that the messages of grace should come _to them_, as condemned, guilty, and perishing sinners; and that as such they should be invited to the cross. Hence the scornful air, the undissembled disgust, with which so many, in high life, turn their backs upon _the preaching of the cross_. And hence, encouraged by their example, multitudes cluster round the standard of a haughty and malignant opposition to the Gospel.  While thus so many regard _the preaching of the cross as foolishness_, and earnestly wish it were utterly false; it is not wonderful, that efforts should be made to prove that it actually is so. Probably some, engaged in this opposition, are perfectly sincere, and actually suppose, as Saul of Tarsus did, that they are _doing God service_, by combating the doctrines of the cross. But whoever obeys the natural dictates of his own heart, and submits himself to the guidance of his own perverted, blinded reason, refusing to supplicate the illuminations of divine grace, will be likely to come under the power of _strong delusion to believe a lie_.  One other cause of opposition to the Gospel is found in the absolute contrariety of its requisitions, to the habits of life, which men have contracted, and which they are resolved not to abandon. While _the preaching of the cross_ prescribes, as indispensable to salvation, conditions with which many, who have no doubt of being saved, wholly refuse to comply; and while it declares that eternal perdition will be the result of a course, which they are determined to pursue; it must be the object of their settled detestation. Hence the love of sinful pursuits and gratifications, and an invincible repugnance to a life of devotion, are the true reasons why many esteem _the preaching of the cross foolishness_.  It ought, however, to be kept in mind, while these causes are recounted, that the operation of each of them is rendered more efficacious, by the agency of that spirit of darkness, _that worketh in the children of disobedience_. To increase disgust against the plan of redemption, to exasperate the natural enmity of the carnal heart, to give a specious appearance to objections, and to enforce, with seductive arguments, the cause of unbelief, is the untiring employment of the grand foe of God and man. It is indeed the darling achievement of infernal skill, to inflate a poor worm with pride of talent, and fill his heart with hatred to the Gospel, and then persuade him that his hatred arises from its falsehood and absurdity. No event can afford the tempter greater joy, than success in persuading perishing sinners to reject the only possible way of escape from eternal death, and to contemn, as foolishness, that doctrine which is the _wisdom of God and the power of God to salvation to every one that believeth_.  It only remains, that we briefly describe the fearful condition and prospects of all to whom _the preaching of the cross is foolishness_.  And here we have only to repeat the decision of the Searcher of hearts--the Judge of the quick and dead. His infallible Spirit has, in our text, divulged the tremendous fact, that the indifference, contempt, and disgust, which have now been described, are characteristics of THEM THAT PERISH. This authority, as well as the nature of the case, renders it certain, that all, who indulge such feelings, are _in the gall of bitterness and under the bond of iniquity_--_dead in trespasses and sins_--_treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath_. Nothing short of utter blindness of mind can be insensible to the glory of the Gospel--nothing but entire depravity of heart can render its doctrines offensive--and nothing but the most obdurate impenitency can resist the melting influence of a Saviour's dying love. It is utterly impossible, that a scornful neglect or disregard of the preaching of the cross should exist, without fearful guilt and imminent danger. All those, among the hearers of the gospel, who will finally be children of wrath, are now characterized by such guilt. And all the lost spirits in the world of wo, who once enjoyed the offers of mercy, cherished the same fatal feelings towards the plan of redemption. It was _foolishness_ to them. Many, even in this land of light, seem to be ripening for the same tremendous doom. Whether in the ranks of open opposition, or under the false colours of pretended regard, the deadly symptom is upon them--a settled disgust and aversion to the _preaching of the cross._  Say not, 'It is no matter what a man believes, provided he is sincere.' God has settled this question.--\"_Because they received not the love of the truth_, _that they might be saved_; _God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie_; _that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth_, _but had pleasure in unrighteousness_.\" Is there not then, appalling evidence, that those, who hold such preaching in contempt, occupy very perilous ground, and exhibit fearful tokens of the divine abandonment? And especially might not the angels in heaven tremble for those, who have enjoyed great light and privileges--have witnessed rich displays of divine grace--and have once felt a deep solicitude for their own souls--but who now despise and hate those truths, and that cause, which they were once _almost persuaded_ to embrace?  How clearly and terribly, my hearers, does this subject discover the ungodliness of the unrenewed heart. Those feelings of contempt and hostility, towards what is most precious and glorious in the view of God, constitute the summit of human guilt. That feeble worms of the dust should thus dare to sit in judgment on the divine administration, and pronounce that needless which God has declared indispensable, and call that folly which God esteems the highest wisdom, is not merely presumptuous;--it is inexpressibly _impious_.  How resistless is the evidence, hence arising, of the necessity of an entire change of heart--an entire change of feeling--to prepare men to dwell with God. No wonder then, that our Lord should declare with such emphasis, _Ye must be born again_, or ye _cannot see the kingdom of God_.  I beseech you, fellow sinners, lay these things seriously to heart. Do any of you habitually hear the preaching of the cross with heartless indifference--with a light and trifling temper? Beware, lest your heart become fatally hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  Are any of you conscious of disgust and aversion, produced by such doctrines? O, beware, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets, Behold, ye dispisers, and wonder, and perish: Beware lest you convert the bread of life into the poison of death!  Have any of you already attained such a degree of blindness and perversity, as to persuade yourselves that the doctrines of the cross are really irrational and absurd, and that you are doing right in opposing and deriding them? Recollect, I pray you, with whose word you are contending;--whose wisdom you are despising! Let the chaff contend with the tempest, and the stubble with the devouring flame; let the glow-worm despise all the lamps of heaven;--but Oh, let not a worm contend with Omnipotence; let not dim reason reject all the splendours of the Sun of righteousness. _The redemption of the soul is precious_--Its rescue from perdition, and elevation to God's right hand, are objects too momentous, to be sacrificed to the pride of intellect, or to the fashion of a world which passeth away. _Receive_, then, _with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves_.     SERMON XXVII.  BY ELIHU W. BALDWIN, A.M.  NEW-YORK.  THE FINAL JUDGMENT.  HEBREWS, IX. 29.--_After this the Judgment_.   Whilst another year is ending, and time itself, as it respects us, is fast hastening to its close, the question very naturally arises, _What shall come after death_? The voice of inspiration replies, _After this the Judgment_. There is no need of entering upon a laboured proof of the doctrine so plainly declared, _That there will be a day of Judgment for mankind_. It is what seems written by the finger of God himself upon the consciences of men. The impression is nearly universal, with Pagans and Mahomedans, as well as Jews and Christians, that _every one of us shall give account of himself to God_. This impression is strengthened by a view of the very unequal and indiscriminate allotments of the present life. Here the virtuous are often the objects of hatred and relentless persecution. Here the man of ambition and dark intrigue, circumvents and treads down his more honest rivals. Here Providence often afflicts even the most pious; while the licentious, and proud, and oppressive, are, perhaps, suffered to enjoy uninterrupted prosperity. Now we believe, assuredly, that \"God is just;\" and we infer, that he will so exhibit himself by another and more equal distribution of his favours and frowns. We conclude with the wise man, \"that God shall judge both the righteous and the wicked.\" Conscience and reason, then, unite with revelation, in saying, that \"God hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness.\" No language can be plainer, and no event more reasonably anticipated.  With this absolute certainty before us, then, of a judgment for all mankind, it would be unnatural--it would betray awful insensibility to eternal concerns, not to inquire with all seriousness--When will this universal judgment take place? What objects is it designed to accomplish? What connexion will it have with our future and eternal condition? We inquire then,   I. _When will the universal Judgment take place?_  The precise time, God has wisely concealed from every intelligent creature. \"Of that day and that hour knoweth no man. No; not the angels that are in heaven.\" But the text speaks of it, in general terms, as that which is to take place "]]]
