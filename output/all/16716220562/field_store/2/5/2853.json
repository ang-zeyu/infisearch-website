Now in June the king had gone to Framlingham, and in August came back to Thetford. Then he sent for my father, begging him to bring Lodbrok with him, that together they might hunt over the great heaths that stretch for many a mile north and west and south of the town. No better sport is there for hawk and hound than on Brandon and Croxton heaths, and the wilds to which our Saxon Icklings and Lakings have given their names, for they stretch from forest to fen, and there is no game in all England that one may not find there, from red deer to coney, wolf to badger, bustard to snipe, while there are otter and beaver in the streams.  So they would go, for the wish of a king is, as it were, a command, even had not both my father and Lodbrok loved to be with him, whether in hall or field. And I thought that I should surely go also.  However, my father had other plans for me, and they were none other than that I should take the ship round to London with some goods we had, and with some of the new barley, just harvested, which would ever find ready sale in London, seeing that no land grows better for ale brewing than ours of East Anglia.  Now that was the first time I had been trusted to command the ship unaided by my father's presence, though of late he would say that he was owner, not captain, and but a passenger of mine; so, though I was sorry not to go to Thetford, I was more proud of myself than I would show; and maybe I would rather have taken to the sea had there been choice.  I was to go to my godfather, Ingild the merchant, who would, as ever, see to business for me; and then, because the season was late, and wind and weather might keep me long in the river, my father bade me stay with him, if I would, and if need were lay up the ship in Thames for the winter, coming home by the great Roman street that runs through Colchester town to our shores; or if Ingild would keep me, staying in London with him even till spring came again.  \"If I must leave the ship,\" I said, \"I shall surely come back to hunt with the jarl and you.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" answered my father, smiling, \"Ingild will have many a brave show for you in town. Wait till you get to London, for the court of Ethelred himself will very likely be there, and there will be much to see. And maybe you will find some Danish ship in the river, and will send her captain here to take the jarl home with him; for we may not hold him as a prisoner with us.\"  Then Lodbrok added that, in any case, I might find means to send messages to his home by some ship sailing to ports that he named; and that I promised I would do. Thereon he gave me a broad silver ring, rune graven, to show as a token to any of his countrymen whom I might meet, for the ring was known.  \"Do not part with it, Wulfric,\" he said, as I thanked him; \"for it may be of use to you some day, if not on this voyage. Jarl Lodbrok is well known on the high seas, and he gives not rings for naught.\"  Now I would not take the falcon with me, but begged the jarl to use her; and I asked him also to train for himself a greyhound that I had bred, and of which he thought highly.  \"Why,\" said he, \"I shall have the best hawk and dog in all Thetford town, and Beorn the falconer will have naught to say to me.\"  Thereat we laughed, for Beorn's jealousy was a sport to us when we thought of it, which was seldom enough.  So these two went to Thetford, and in the last week of August I sailed for London, with a fair breeze over the quarter, from our haven.    CHAPTER III. WHAT CAME IN A NORTH SEA FOG.   Night saw our ship off Orfordness, and there the breeze failed us, and a thick fog, hiding the land and its lights, crept up from seaward and wrapped us round. But before it came, on Orfordness a fire burnt redly, though what it was, unless it might be some fisher's beacon, we could not tell.  The fog lifted as we drifted past the wide mouth of Stour and Orwell rivers with a little breeze, and the early daylight showed us the smoke of a fire that burnt on the higher land that shuts in the haven's mouth on its southern shores. But even as we saw it, the fog closed round us again and the wind died away, so that we lowered the sail, and the men got out the oars, and slowly, while Kenulf swung the lead line constantly, we crept on among the sand banks down the coast.  Presently the tide turned against us, and Kenulf thought well that we should drop anchor and wait for its turning again. The men gladly laid in the oars, and the anchor rattled out and held. The ship swung to her cable, and then there seemed deep silence after the even roll and creak of the great sweeps in their rowlocks. The fog was very dense, and beyond our stem head I could see nothing.  Then to break the silence came to us, over no great stretch of water as it seemed, the sound of a creaking block, the fall of a yard on deck, and a voice raised in some sharp order. Then I thought I heard an anchor plunge, and there was silence. Very ghostly it seemed to hear these familiar sounds and to see naught, and it was the more so that we might by no means judge from which side of us, or fore or aft, the noises came, for fog will confuse all things, and save a driving snowstorm, I dread nothing more at sea.  Now the men began to speak in whispers, for the silence and weirdness of the fog quieted us all. And, moreover, when the fog lifted we had seen no ship, though there must be one close to us now, and we wondered.  But Kenulf came to me presently with a scared face, and waiting till the men had gone forward to find their food, he asked me if I heard the voice that spoke.  \"Aye, surely,\" I answered. \"What of it?\"  \"Master,\" he said, \"the voice was a Danish voice, as I think. And I mind me of the fires we saw.\"  \"What then?\" said I carelessly, though indeed I could see well what fear was in the old man's mind. Yet I would have him put the thing into words, being ready to look the worst in the face at any time.  \"The vikings, master,\" he answered; \"surely they were in Orwell mouth and saw us, and have given chase.\"  \"We should have seen them also,\" I said.  \"Not so, master, for the fog hung inland, and if a Dane lies in such a place he has ever men watching the sea--and they will sail two ship's lengths to our one.\"  \"Supposing the ship is a viking, what should we do now?\" I asked, for I knew of naught to do but bide where we were.  \"Go back with tide and slip past them even now,\" said Kenulf, though I think he knew that this was hopeless, for if we rowed, the sound of our oars would betray us, and if not we should be on a shoal before long, whence any escape would be impossible.  \"Hark!\" I said in another moment, and we listened.  There was little noise beyond the lapping of the swift tide against our sides. The men forward were silent, and I had thought that I heard the distant sound of voices and oars.  It came again in the stillness; a measured beat that one could not well mistake, as of a ship's boat leisurely pulled.  Then one of our men began to sing in an undertone, and Kenulf smote his hands together in terror, for the sound would betray us, and he was going forward to stop the song.  \"No matter,\" said I, \"they know we are not far off, for I think they must have anchored when they heard us do so, as we heard them. If they seek us they will soon find us.\"  \"They are coming nearer,\" said Kenulf, and I heard the oars more plainly yet.  Now the thought of calling my men to arms came over me, but I remembered how Lodbrok had told me that resistance to vikings, unless it were successful, meant surely death, but that seldom would the unresisting be harmed, even if the ship were wantonly burnt after plunder, and the crew set adrift in their boat.  Still the oars drew nearer, and I thought of the words that Lodbrok had spoken--how that shipmen would be glad of his presence--and I wished that he were indeed with me, for now I knew what he meant.  Now, too, I knew his gift of the ring to be our safety, and surely he had given it to me for this. So I grew confident, and even longed to see the sharp bow of the boat cleave the mist, if only her crew knew of our friend by name at least. Yet they might be Norse--not Danish.  But the sound of oars crossed our bows and died away again, and then a voice hailed from the ship, as I thought, and there was silence.  Kenulf and I breathed more freely then, and we too went forward and ate and drank, and afterwards spoke of the chance of slipping away when the tide turned, though I was sure that, if the ship were what we thought, she would up anchor and drift with us.  So the hours of flood tide passed, and then the ship began to swing idly as the slack came. Then with the turn of tide came little flaws of wind, and we hoisted the sail, and Kenulf hove the anchor short. Yet we heard no more sounds from the other ship.  Then all in a minute the fog thinned, lifted, and cleared away, and I saw the most beautiful sight my eyes had ever lighted on, and the most terrible.  For, not half a mile from us, lay a great viking snekr {vii}, with the sunlight full on her and flashing from the towering green and gold and crimson dragon's head that formed her stem, and from the gay line of crimson and yellow shields that hung along her rail from end to end of the long curve of her sides. Her mast was lowered, and rested, with the furled blue and white striped sail, on the stanchions and crossbars that upheld it, to leave the deck clear for swing of sword and axe; and over the curving dragon tail of the stern post floated a forked black and golden flag. And wondrously light and graceful were the lines on which she was built, so that beside her our stout cargo ship"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13752"],["title","Wulfric the Weapon Thane: A Story of the Danish Conquest of East Anglia (#7)"],["body","shapeless and heavy, as did our log canoes beside Lodbrok's boat. As soon should our kitchen turnspit dog fly the greyhound that I had given Lodbrok, as such a ship as ours from this swift viking's craft.  But her beauty was not that which drew the eyes of my men. Little they thought of wonder or pleasure in gazing on the ship herself. All her decks were crowded with scarlet-cloaked men, and the sunlight which made the ship so bright flashed also from helm and spear and mail coat from stem to stern. And at that sight every tale of viking cruelty they had heard came into their minds, and they were overcome with terror, so that I thought that several would have cast themselves into the sea, away from the terrible ship, choosing rather death by water than by the sword. But I saw some half dozen whose faces set hard with other thoughts than these, and they turned to seek their weapons from under the fore deck.  Then I spoke to them, for it was time; and I would have neither fear nor defiance shown, for I knew that we should be boarded.  \"Yonder ship belongs, as I think, to the people of our guest, Lodbrok the Dane. So it seems to me that they will gladly hear news of him from us, as he is a great man in Denmark. And surely we have deserved well of his folk in every way, and we of East Anglia are at peace with the Danish host. Therefore, let us wait till they board us, and then let no man stir from his place or speak a word, that I may talk with them in peace.\"  Those words were listened to eagerly, and they wrought on the minds of my poor fellows as I wished. Moreover, to put our one chance of safety into form thus heartened me also, for I will not say that I feared nothing from these vikings, who might know and care naught concerning our sea-borne guest, even were they Danes.  Yet it seemed that none saw my fears, for in a little the men asked if they might take their weapons. And though it seemed hard to me and them alike to bide unarmed, I knew it was safer, and so bade them meet the Danes in all peaceful seeming.  Now we saw a boat lowered from the longship's side, and one by one armed men entered her, and she sank deeply in the water. Ten I counted, and at last one more, who, I supposed, was the leader.  So deep was she that, as she left the ship, I thought how that one sack of our grain, hove into her as she came alongside, would sink her and leave her crew to drown in our sight. But then the ship herself would close on us, and not one of us but would pay for that deed with his life.  So she came slowly over the glassy water of the slack tide, and my men watched her, saying nothing.  Soon she came alongside, and at a sign from me Kenulf threw a line which the bowman caught, and I thought that a word or two of wonder passed among her crew. They dropped to where the curve of our deck was lowest, and instantly the leader leapt on board and all but one of his men followed, axe or drawn sword in hand. As I had bidden them, not one of my men stirred save Kenulf, who made fast the line and stood watching.  The leader was a young man, of about my own age, clad in golden shining bronze scale armour and wearing a silver helm on which were short, black, curving horns; and he bore a double-headed axe, besides the sword at his side. He looked round on us--at the men standing silent, at Kenulf, and at me as I stood on the after deck resting on the tiller, and broke into a great laugh.  \"Well,\" he cried, \"are you all dumb, or fools, or wise men; or a little of all three?\"  But my men answered nothing, even as I had bidden them, and I thought that my time was not yet come to speak.  \"The fog has got into their throats,\" said a Dane; for with a great lifting of my heart I knew their tongue, and it was Lodbrok's and not Norse.  \"Struck speechless with fear more like,\" said another.  \"Ho, men,\" said the leader, \"which is your captain?\"  One of our crew pointed to me, and I came to the break of the deck saying:  \"I am master of this ship.\"  And I spoke as a Dane, for my long company with Lodbrok had given me the very turn of his speech.  At that the viking stared at me, and one of his men said:  \"When did Danes take to trading on this coast?\"  \"You are Saxon by all seeming,\" said the leader, \"yet you speak like a Dane. Whence are you, and how learned you our tongue so glibly?\"  \"We are from Reedham in East Anglia, which is at peace with the Danish host,\" I said; \"and I learnt the Danish speech from one who is my friend, Lodbrok the Dane, whom men call Jarl Lodbrok.\"  Now at that word the Danes all turned to me, and hardly one but let fall some word of wonder; and the young leader took two great steps towards me, with his face flushing and his eyes lit up with a new look.  Then he stopped, and his face changed, growing white and angry, and his teeth closed tightly as he looked at me. Then he said:  \"Now if you are making a tale to save your skins, worse shall it be for you. What know you of Lodbrok?\"  I held out my hand, on which the jarl's ring shone white against the sea-browned skin.  \"Here is a token he gave me before I sailed, that some friend of his might know it and speak to me,\" I said.  The viking dropped his axe on the deck and seized my hand, gazing at the ring and the runes graven thereon.  \"Lives he yet?\" he said, breathless.  \"Aye, Halfden Lodbroksson, your father lives and is well in our house,\" I answered; for now I knew that this was surely the youngest of those three sons of whom the jarl had told me so often.  Now at that word the Danes broke into a great cheer, but Halfden laid his hands on my shoulders and kissed me on both cheeks, while the tears of joy ran down his face.  \"Well must Lodbrok my father love you if he has told you so much that you know me by name,\" he cried; \"and well does he trust you since he has given you his ring. Tell me more and ever more of him.\"  Then sudden as before his mood changed, and he let me go and climbed on the rail with his arm round a backstay, and taking off his helm he lifted up a mighty shout to his ship:  \"Found is Jarl Lodbrok, ahoy!\"  And with uplifted weapons his men repeated the shout, so that it seemed as though the loved name was heard across the still water, for the men on board the ship cheered in answer.  Now nothing would serve Halfden but that I must go with him on board his own ship, there to tell him all I might; and he laughed gaily, saying that he had looked indeed for a rich booty, but had gained that which was more worth to him.  Then I told Kenulf that we would bide at anchor till we knew what should be done, thinking it likely that Halfden would wish us to pilot him back to Reedham.  \"We shall lose our tide,\" grumbled the old man, who was himself again, now that he knew we had naught to fear.  \"That is all we shall lose,\" I answered, \"and what matters it? we have all our time before us.\"  \"I like not the weather,\" he said shortly.  But I paid no more heed to him, for Halfden spoke to me.  \"Let me leave a few men here,\" he said; \"the boat is overladen, and the sea is rising with the breeze;\" and then he added with a smile that had much grim meaning in it. \"They bide as friends with you, and but for our safety; not to take charge of your ship.\"  So I bade Kenulf give the three who remained the best cheer that we might, treating them as Lodbrok's men; for the old pilot loved the jarl well, and I knew that for his sake he would do much.  Then in a few more minutes I stood on the deck of Halfden's ship, and word went round quickly of my news, so that I had a good welcome. Yet I liked not the look of the Danish men, after the honest faces of our own crew. It seemed to me that they were hard featured and cruel looking, though towards me were none but friendly looks. Yet I speak of the crew only, for Halfden was like his father in face and speech, and that is saying much for him in both.  They spread a great awning, striped in blue and white like the sail, over the after deck, and there they set food and wine for us, and Halfden and I sat down together. And with us one other, an older man, tall and bushy bearded, with a square, grave face scarred with an old wound. Thormod was his name, and I knew presently that he was Halfden's foster father, and the real captain of the ship while Halfden led the fighting men.  \"Food first and talk after,\" quoth this Thormod, and we fell to.  So when we had finished, and sat with ale horns only before us, Halfden said:  \"I have sought tidings of my father from the day when he was lost until this. Now tell me all his story from end to end.\"  And I did so; though when it came to the throwing of the line to the boat I said naught of my own part in that, there being no need, and moreover that I would not seem to praise myself. And I ended by saying how Lodbrok was even now at court with Eadmund, our king, and high in favour with him and all lesser men.  Many were the questions that the Danes asked me as I spoke, and I answered them plainly, for indeed I was glad to see the look in Halfden's eyes as I spoke to him of his father, I having naught but pleasant things to tell of him, which one may say of few men, perhaps. And by and by I spoke of his having taught me the use of the Danish axe.  \"Ho!\" said Thormod; \"hold your peace for a while, and we will see what sort of pupil he had.\"  Then he rose up and took his axe, and bade me take Halfden's, which I did, not over willingly maybe, while Halfden stood by, smiling.  \"I will not harm you,\" said Thormod shortly, seeing that I was not over eager. \"See here!\"  His ale horn stood on the low table where we had been sitting, and now he placed it on the gunwale, going from under the awning. The men who sat along the decks looked up at him and were still.  Then he heaved up the axe with both hands and whirled it, bringing it down with such force that I looked to see both horn and gunwale shorn through. But so skilful was he that he stayed that mighty stroke so that the keen edge of"]]]
