His first decided     literary success, _Le Pied de Fanchette_, was suggested by a     vision of a girl with a charming foot, casually seen in the     street. While all such passages in his books are really founded     on his own personal feelings and experiences, in his elaborate     autobiography, _Monsieur Nicolas_, he has frankly set forth the     gradual evolution and cause of his idiosyncrasy. The first     remembered trace dated from the age of 4, when he was able to     recall having remarked the feet of a young girl in his native     place. Restif was a sexually precocious youth, and at the age of     9, though both delicate in health and shy in manners, his     thoughts were already absorbed in the girls around him. \"While     little Monsieur Nicolas,\" he tells us, \"passed for a Narcissus,     his thoughts, as soon as he was alone, by night or by day, had no     other object than that sex he seemed to flee from. The girls most     careful of their persons were naturally those who pleased him     most, and as the part least easy to keep clean is that which     touches the earth it was to the foot-gear that he mechanically     gave his chief attention. Agathe, Reine, and especially     Madeleine, were the most elegant of the girls at that time; their     carefully selected and kept shoes, instead of laces or buckles,     which were not yet worn at Sacy, had blue or rose ribbon,     according to the color of the skirt. I thought of these girls     with emotion; I desired--I knew not what; but I desired     something, if it were only to subdue them.\" The origin Restif     here assigns to his shoe-fetichism may seem paradoxical; he     admired the girls who were most clean and neat in their dress, he     tells us, and, therefore, paid most attention to that part of     their clothing which was least clean and neat. But, however     paradoxical the remark may seem, it is psychologically sound. All     fetichism is a kind of not necessarily morbid obsession, and as     the careful work of Janet and others in that field has shown, an     obsession is a fascinated attraction to some object or idea     which gives the subject a kind of emotional shock by its     contrast to his habitual moods or ideas. The ordinary morbid     obsession cannot usually be harmoniously co-ordinated with the     other experiences of the subject's daily life, and shows,     therefore, no tendency to become pleasurable. Sexual fetichisms,     on the other hand, have a reservoir of agreeable emotion to draw     on, and are thus able to acquire both stability and harmony. It     will also be seen that no element of masochism is involved in     Restif's fetichism, though the mistake has been frequently made     of supposing that these two manifestations are usually or even     necessarily allied. Restif wishes to subject the girl who     attracts him, he has no wish to be subjected by her. He was     especially dazzled by a young girl from another town, whose shoes     were of a fashionable cut, with buckles, \"and who was a charming     person besides.\" She was delicate as a fairy, and rendered his     thoughts unfaithful to the robust beauties of his native Sacy.     \"No doubt,\" he remarks, \"because, being frail and weak myself, it     seemed to me that it would be easier to subdue her.\" \"This taste     for the beauty of the feet,\" he continues, \"was so powerful in me     that it unfailingly aroused desire and would have made me     overlook ugliness. It is excessive in all those who have it.\" He     admired the foot as well as the shoe: \"The factitious taste for     the shoe is only a reflection of that for pretty feet. When I     entered a house and saw the boots arranged in a row, as is the     custom, I would tremble with pleasure; I blushed and lowered my     eyes as if in the presence of the girls themselves. With this     vivacity of feeling and a voluptuousness of ideas inconceivable     at the age of 10 I still fled, with an involuntary impulse of     modesty, from the girls I adored.\"      We may clearly see how this combination of sensitive and     precocious sexual ardor with extreme shyness, furnished the soil     on which the germ of shoe-fetichism was able to gain a firm root     and persist in some degree throughout a long life very largely     given up to a pursuit of women, abnormal rather by its     excessiveness than its perversity. A few years later, he tells     us, he happened to see a pretty pair of shoes in a bootmaker's     shop, and on hearing that they belonged to a girl whom at that     time he reverently adored at a distance he blushed and nearly     fainted.      In 1749 he was for a time attracted to a young woman very much     older than himself; he secretly carried away one of her slippers     and kept it for a day; a little later he again took away a shoe     of the same woman which had fascinated him when on her foot, and,     he seems to imply, he used it to masturbate with.      Perhaps the chief passion of Restif's life was his love for     Colette Parangon. He was still a boy (1752), she was the young     and virtuous wife of the printer whose apprentice Restif was and     in whose house he lived. Madame Parangon, a charming woman, as     she is described, was not happily married, and she evidently     felt a tender affection for the boy whose excessive love and     reverence for her were not always successfully concealed.     \"Madonna Parangon,\" he tells us, \"possessed a charm which I could     never resist, a pretty little foot; it is a charm which arouses     more than tenderness. Her shoes, made in Paris, had that     voluptuous elegance which seems to communicate soul and life.     Sometimes Colette wore shoes of simple white drugget or with     silver flowers; sometimes rose-colored slippers with green heels,     or green with rose heels; her supple feet, far from deforming her     shoes, increased their grace and rendered the form more     exciting.\" One day, on entering the house, he saw Madame Parangon     elegantly dressed and wearing rose-colored shoes with tongues,     and with green heels and a pretty rosette. They were new and she     took them off to put on green slippers with rose heels and     borders which he thought equally exciting. As soon as she had     left the room, he continues, \"carried away by the most impetuous     passion and idolizing Colette, I seemed to see her and touch her     in handling what she had just worn; my lips pressed one of these     jewels, while the other, deceiving the sacred end of nature, from     excess of exaltation replaced the object of sex (I cannot express     myself more clearly). The warmth which she had communicated to     the insensible object which had touched her still remained and     gave a soul to it; a voluptuous cloud covered my eyes.\" He adds     that he would kiss with rage and transport whatever had come in     close contact with the woman he adored, and on one occasion     eagerly pressed his lips to her cast-off underlinen, _vela     secretiora penetralium_.      At this period Restif's foot-fetichism reached its highest point     of development. It was the aberration of a highly sensitive and     very precocious boy. While the preoccupation with feet and shoes     persisted throughout life, it never became a complete perversion     and never replaced the normal end of sexual desire. His love for     Madam Parangon, one of the deepest emotions in his whole life,     was also the climax of his shoe-fetichism. She represented his     ideal woman, an ethereal sylph with wasp-waist and a child's     feet; it was always his highest praise for a woman that she     resembled Madame Parangon, and he desired that her slipper should     be buried with him. (Restif de la Bretonne, _Monsieur Nicolas_,     vols. i-iv, vol. xiii, p. 5; id., _Mes Inscriptions_, pp. ci-cv.)      Shoe-fetichism, more especially if we include under this term all     the cases of real or pseudo-masochism in which an attraction to     the boots or slippers is the chief feature, is a not infrequent     phenomenon, and is certainly the most frequently occurring form     of fetichism. Many cases are brought together by Krafft-Ebing in     his _Psychopathia Sexualis_. Every prostitute of any experience     has known men who merely desire to gaze at her shoes, or possibly     to lick them, and who are quite willing to pay for this     privilege. In London such a person is known as a \"bootman,\" in     Germany as a \"Stiefelfrier.\"  The predominance of the foot as a focus of sexual attraction, while among us to-day it is a not uncommon phenomenon, is still not sufficiently common to be called normal; the majority of even ardent lovers do not experience this attraction in any marked degree. But these manifestations of foot-fetichism which with us to-day are abnormal, even when they are not so extreme as to be morbid, may perhaps become more intelligible to us when we realize that in earlier periods of civilization, and even to-day in some parts of the world, the foot is generally recognized as a focus of sexual attraction, so that some degree of foot-fetichism becomes a normal phenomenon.  The most pronounced and the best known example of such normal foot-fetichism at the present day is certainly to be found among the Southern Chinese. For a Chinese husband his wife's foot is more interesting than her face. A Chinese woman is as shy of showing her feet to a man as a European woman her breasts; they are reserved for her husband's eyes alone, and to look at a woman's feet in the street is highly improper and indelicate. Chinese foot-fetichism is connected with the custom of compressing the feet. This custom appears to rest on the fact that Chinese women naturally possess a very small foot and is thus an example of the universal tendency in the search for beauty to accentuate, even by deformation, the racial"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#6)"],["body","haracteristics. But there is more than this. Beauty is largely a name for sexual attractiveness, and the energy expended in the effort to make the Chinese woman's small foot still smaller is a measure of the sexual fascination which it exerts. The practice arose on the basis of the sexual attractiveness of the foot, though it has doubtless served to heighten that attractiveness, just as the small waist, which (if we may follow Stratz) is a characteristic beauty of the European woman, becomes to the average European man still more attractive when accentuated, even to the extent of deformity, by the compression of the corset.      Referring to the sexual fascination exerted by the foot in China,     Matignon writes: \"My attention has been drawn to this point by a     large number of pornographic engravings, of which the Chinese are     very fond. In all these lascivious scenes we see the male     voluptuously fondling the woman's foot. When a Celestial takes     into his hand a woman's foot, especially if it is very small, the     effect upon him is precisely the same as is provoked in a     European by the palpation of a young and firm bosom. All the     Celestials whom I have interrogated on this point have replied     unanimously: 'Oh, a little foot! You Europeans cannot understand     how exquisite, how sweet, how exciting it is!' The contact of the     genital organ with the little foot produces in the male an     indescribable degree of voluptuous feeling, and women skilled in     love know that to arouse the ardor of their lovers a better     method than all Chinese aphrodisiacs--including 'giusen' and     swallows' nests--is to take the penis between their feet. It is     not rare to find Chinese Christians accusing themselves at     confession of having had 'evil thoughts on looking at a woman's     foot.'\" (Dr. J. Matignon, \"A propos d'un Pied de Chinoise,\"     _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, 1898.)      It is said that a Chinese Empress, noted for her vice and having     a congenital club foot, about the year 1100 B.C., desired all     women to resemble her, and that the practice of compressing the     foot thus arose. But this is only tradition, since, in 300 B.C.,     Chinese books were destroyed (Morache, Art. \"Chine,\"     _Dictionnaire Encyclopédique des Sciences Médicales_, p. 191). It     is also said that the practice owes its origin to the wish to     keep women indoors. But women are not secluded in China, nor does     foot compression usually render a woman unable to walk. Many     intelligent Chinese are of opinion that its object is to promote     the development of the sexual parts and of the thighs, and so to     aid both intercourse and parturition. There is no ground for     believing that it has any such influence, though Morache found     that the mons veneris and labia are largely developed in Chinese     women, and not in Tartar women living in Pekin (who do not     compress the foot). If there is any correlation between the feet     and the pelvic regions, it is more probably congenital than due     to the artificial compression of the feet. The ancients seem to     have believed that a small foot indicated a small vagina. Restif     de la Bretonne, who had ample opportunities for forming an     opinion on a matter in which he took so great an interest,     believed that a small foot, round and short, indicated a large     vagina (_Monsieur Nicolas_, vol. i, reprint of 1883, p. 92).     Even, however, if we admit that there is a real correlation     between the foot and the vagina, that would by no means suffice     to render the foot a focus of sexual attraction.      It remains the most reasonable view that the foot bandage must be     regarded as strictly analogous to the waist bandage or corset     which also tends to produce deformity of the constricted region.     Stratz has ingeniously remarked (_Frauenkleidung_, third edition,     p. 101) that the success of the Chinese in dwarfing trees may     have suggested a similar attempt in regard to women's feet, and     adds that in any case both dwarfed trees and bound feet bear     witness in the Mongolian to the same love for small and elegant,     not to say deformed, things. For a Chinaman the deformed foot is     a \"golden water-lily.\"      Many facts (together with illustrations) bearing on Chinese     deformation of the foot will be found in Ploss, _Das Weib_, vol.     i, Section IV.  The significance of the sexual emotion aroused by the female foot in China and the origin of its compression begin to become clear when we realize that this foot-fetichism is merely an extreme development of a tendency which is fairly well marked among nearly all the peoples of yellow race. Jacoby, who has brought together a number of interesting facts bearing on the sexual significance of the foot, states that a similar tendency is to be found among the Mongol and Turk peoples of Siberia, and in the east and central parts of European Russia, among the Permiaks, the Wotiaks, etc. Here the woman, at all events when young, has always her feet, as well as head, covered, however little clothing she may otherwise wear.      \"On hot nights or on baking days,\" Jacoby states, \"you may see     these women with uncovered breasts, or even entirely naked     without embarrassment, but you will never see them with bare     feet, and no male relations, except the husband, will ever see     the feet and lower part of the legs of the women in the house.     These women have their modesty in their feet, and also their     coquetry; to unbind the feet of a woman is for a man a voluptuous     act, and the touch of the bands produces the same effect as a     corset still warm from a woman's body on a European man. A     woman's beauty, that which attracts and excites a man, lies in     her foot; in Mordvin love poems celebrating the beauty of women     there is much about her attire, especially her embroidered     chemise, but as regards the charms of her person the poet is     content to state that 'her feet are beautiful;' with that     everything is said. The young peasant woman of the central     provinces as part of her holiday raiment puts on great woolen     stockings which come up to the groin and are then folded over to     below the knee. To uncover the feet of a person of the opposite     sex is a sexual act, and has thus become the symbol of sexual     possession, so that the stocking or foot-gear became the emblem     of marriage, as later the ring. (It was so among the Jews, as we     see in the book of _Ruth_, Chapter III, v. 4, and Chapter IV, vv.     7 and 8). St. Vladimir the Great asked in marriage the daughter     of Prince Rogvold; as Vladimir's mother had been a serf, the     princess proudly replied that she 'would not uncover the feet of     a slave.' At the present time in the east of Russia when a young     girl tries to find out by divination whom she will have as a     husband the traditional formula is 'Come and take my stockings     off.' Among the populations of the north and east, it is     sometimes the bride who must do this for her husband on the     wedding night, and sometimes the bridegroom for his wife, not as     a token of love, but as a nuptial ceremony. Among the     professional classes and small nobility in Russia parents place     money in the stocking of their child at marriage as a present for     the other partner, it being supposed that the couple mutually     remove each other's foot raiment, as an act of sexual possession,     the emblem of coitus.\" (Paul Jacoby, _Archives d'Anthropologie     Criminelle_, December, 1903, p. 793.) The practice among     ourselves of children hanging up their stockings at night for     presents would seem to be a relic of the last-mentioned custom.  While we may witness the sexual symbolism of the foot, with or without an associated foot-fetichism, most highly developed in Asia and Eastern Europe, it has by no means been altogether unknown in some stages of western civilization, and traces of it may be found here and there even yet. Schinz refers to the connection between the feet and sexual pleasure as existing not only among the Egyptians and the Arabs, but among the ancient Germans and the modern Spaniards,[16] while Jacoby points out that among the Greeks, the Romans, and especially the Etruscans, it was usual to represent chaste and virgin goddesses with their feet covered, even though they might be otherwise nude. Ovid, again, is never weary of dwelling on the sexual charm of the feminine foot. He represents the chaste matron as wearing a weighted _stola_ which always fell so as to cover her feet; it was only the courtesan, or the nymph who is taking part in an erotic festival, who appears with raised robes, revealing her feet.[17] So grave a historian as Strabo, as well as Ælian, refers to the story of the courtesan Rhodope whose sandal was carried off by an eagle and dropped in the King of Egypt's lap as he was administering justice, so that he could not rest until he had discovered to whom this delicately small sandal belonged, and finally made her his queen. Kleinpaul, who repeats this story, has collected many European sayings and customs (including Turkish), indicating that the slipper is a very ancient symbol of a woman's sexual parts.[18]      In Rome, Dufour remarks, \"Matrons having appropriated the use of     the shoe (_soccus_) prostitutes were not allowed to use it, and     were obliged to have their feet always naked in sandals or     slippers (_crepida_ and _solea_), which they fastened over the     instep with gilt bands. Tibullus delights to describe his     mistress's little foot, compressed by the band that imprisoned     it: _Ansaque compressos colligat arcta pedes_. Nudity of the foot     in woman was a sign of prostitution, and their brilliant     whiteness acted afar as a pimp to attract looks and desires.\"     (Dufour, _Histoire de la"]]]
