Nay, not to be won at all! The only virtue that a Gypsy prizes Is chastity.  That is her only virtue. Dearer than life she holds it.  I remember A Gypsy woman, a vile, shameless bawd, Whose craft was to betray the young and fair; And yet this woman was above all bribes. And when a noble lord, touched by her beauty, The wild and wizard beauty of her race, Offered her gold to be what she made others, She turned upon him, with a look of scorn, And smote him in the face!    Lara.        And does that prove That Preciosa is above suspicion?    Don C.  It proves a nobleman may be repulsed When he thinks conquest easy.  I believe That woman, in her deepest degradation, Holds something sacred, something undefiled, Some pledge and keepsake of her higher nature, And, like the diamond in the dark, retains Some quenchless gleam of the celestial light!    Lara.  Yet Preciosa would have taken the gold.    Don C.  (rising).  I do not think so.    Lara.         I am sure of it. But why this haste?  Stay yet a little longer, And fight the battles of your Dulcinea.    Don C.  'T is late.  I must begone, for if I stay You will not be persuaded.    Lara.         Yes; persuade me.    Don C.  No one so deaf as he who will not hear!    Lara.  No one so blind as he who will not see!    Don C.  And so good night.  I wish you pleasant dreams, And greater faith in woman.      [Exit.    Lara.          Greater faith! I have the greatest faith; for I believe Victorian is her lover.  I believe That I shall be to-morrow; and thereafter Another, and another, and another, Chasing each other through her zodiac, As Taurus chases Aries.  (Enter FRANCISCO with a casket.)                  Well, Francisco, What speed with Preciosa?    Fran.         None, my lord. She sends your jewels back, and bids me tell you She is not to be purchased by your gold.    Lara.  Then I will try some other way to win her. Pray, dost thou know Victorian?    Fran.          Yes, my lord; I saw him at the jeweller's to-day.    Lara.  What was he doing there?    Fran.         I saw him buy A golden ring, that had a ruby in it.    Lara.  Was there another like it?    Fran.          One so like it I could not choose between them.    Lara.             It is well. To-morrow morning bring that ring to me. Do not forget. Now light me to my bed.                     [Exeunt.   SCENE II. -- A street in Madrid.  Enter CHISPA, followed by musicians, with a bagpipe, guitars, and other instruments.    Chispa.  Abernuncio Satanas! and a plague on all lovers who ramble  about at night, drinking the elements, instead of sleeping quietly in  their beds.  Every dead man to his cemetery, say I; and every friar to his monastery.  Now, here's my master, Victorian, yesterday a cow-keeper, and to-day a gentleman; yesterday a student, and to-day a lover; and I must be up later than the nightingale, for as the abbot sings so must the sacristan respond.  God grant he may soon be  married, for then shall all this serenading cease.  Ay, marry! marry!  marry! Mother, what does marry mean?  It means to spin, to bear children, and to weep, my daughter!  And, of a truth, there is something more in matrimony than the wedding-ring.  (To the musicians.)  And now, gentlemen, Pax vobiscum! as the ass said to the cabbages.  Pray, walk this way; and don't hang down your heads. It is no disgrace to have an old father and a ragged shirt.  Now, look you,  you are gentlemen who lead the life of crickets; you enjoy hunger by  day and noise by night.  Yet, I beseech you, for this once be not loud, but pathetic; for it is a serenade to a damsel in bed, and not to the Man in the Moon. Your object is not to arouse and terrify, but to soothe and bring lulling dreams.  Therefore, each shall not play upon his instrument as if it were the only one in the universe, but gently, and with a certain modesty, according with the others. Pray, how may I call thy name, friend?    First Mus.  Geronimo Gil, at your service.    Chispa.  Every tub smells of the wine that is in it.  Pray, Geronimo, is not Saturday an unpleasant day with thee?    First Mus.  Why so?    Chispa.  Because I have heard it said that Saturday is an unpleasant day with those who have but one shirt.  Moreover, I have seen thee at the tavern, and if thou canst run as fast as thou canst  drink, I should like to hunt hares with thee.  What instrument is that?    First Mus.  An Aragonese bagpipe.    Chispa.  Pray, art thou related to the bagpiper of Bujalance, who  asked a maravedi for playing, and ten for leaving off?    First Mus.  No, your honor.    Chispa.  I am glad of it.  What other instruments have we?    Second and Third Musicians.  We play the bandurria.    Chispa.  A pleasing instrument. And thou?    Fourth Mus.  The fife.    Chispa.  I like it; it has a cheerful, soul-stirring sound, that soars up to my lady's window like the song of a swallow. And you others?    Other Mus.  We are the singers, please your honor.    Chispa.  You are too many.  Do you think we are going to sing mass in the cathedral of Cordova?  Four men can make but little use of one shoe, and I see not how you can all sing in one song. But follow me along the garden wall.  That is the way my master climbs to the lady's window, it is by the Vicar's skirts that the Devil climbs into the belfry.  Come, follow me, and make no noise.                [Exeunt.   SCENE III. -- PRECIOSA'S chamber. She stands at the open window.    Prec.  How slowly through the lilac-scented air Descends the tranquil moon!  Like thistle-down The vapory clouds float in the peaceful sky; And sweetly from yon hollow vaults of shade The nightingales breathe out their souls in song. And hark! what songs of love, what soul-like sounds, Answer them from below!  SERENADE.  Stars of the summer night!     Far in yon azure deeps, Hide, hide your golden light!     She sleeps! My lady sleeps!     Sleeps!  Moon of the summer night!     Far down yon western steeps, Sink, sink in silver light!     She sleeps! My lady sleeps!     Sleeps!  Wind of the summer night!     Where yonder woodbine creeps, Fold, fold thy pinions light!     She sleeps! My lady sleeps!     Sleeps!  Dreams of the summer night!     Tell her, her lover keeps Watch! while in slumbers light     She sleeps My lady sleeps     Sleeps!  (Enter VICTORIAN by the balcony.)    Vict.  Poor little dove!  Thou tremblest like a leaf!    Prec.  I am so frightened!  'T is for thee I tremble! I hate to have thee climb that wall by night! Did no one see thee?    Vict.       None, my love, but thou.   Prec. 'T is very dangerous; and when thou art gone I chide myself for letting thee come here Thus stealthily by night.  Where hast thou been? Since yesterday I have no news from thee.    Vict.  Since yesterday I have been in Alcala. Erelong the time will come, sweet Preciosa, When that dull distance shall no more divide us; And I no more shall scale thy wall by night To steal a kiss from thee, as I do now.    Prec.  An honest thief, to steal but what thou givest.    Vict.  And we shall sit together unmolested, And words of true love pass from tongue to tongue, As singing birds from one bough to another.    Prec.  That were a life to make time envious! I knew that thou wouldst come to me to-night. I saw thee at the play.    Vict.        Sweet child of air! Never did I behold thee so attired And garmented in beauty as to-night! What hast thou done to make thee look so fair?    Prec.  Am I not always fair?    Vict.         Ay, and so fair That I am jealous of all eyes that see thee, And wish that they were blind.    Prec.        I heed them not; When thou art present, I see none but thee!    Vict.  There's nothing fair nor beautiful, but takes Something from thee, that makes it beautiful.    Prec.  And yet thou leavest me for those dusty books.    Vict.  Thou comest between me and those books too often! I see thy face in everything I see! The paintings in the chapel wear thy looks, The canticles are changed to sarabands, And with the leaned doctors of the schools I see thee dance cachuchas.    Prec.         In good sooth, I dance with learned doctors of the schools To-morrow morning.    Vict.  And with whom, I pray?    Prec.  A grave and reverend Cardinal, and his Grace The Archbishop of Toledo.    Vict.        What mad jest Is this?    Prec.  It is no jest; indeed it is not.    Vict.    Prithee, explain thyself.    Prec.         Why, simply thus. Thou knowest the Pope has sent here into Spain To put a stop to dances on the stage.    Vict.  I have heard it whispered.    Prec.        Now the Cardinal, Who for this purpose comes, would fain behold With his own eyes these dances; and the Archbishop Has sent for me--    Vict.  That thou mayst dance before them! Now viva la cachucha!  It will breathe The fire of youth into these gray old men! 'T will be thy proudest conquest!   Prec.            Saving one. And yet I fear these dances will be stopped, And Preciosa be once more a beggar.    Vict.  The sweetest beggar that e'er asked for alms; With such beseeching eyes, that when I saw thee I gave my heart away!    Prec.      Dost thou remember When first we met?    Vict.      It was at Cordova, In the cathedral garden. Thou wast sitting Under the orange-trees, beside a fountain.    Prec. 'T was Easter-Sunday.  The full-blossomed trees Filled all the air with fragrance and with joy. The priests were singing, and the organ sounded, And then anon the great cathedral bell. It was the elevation of the Host. We both of us fell down upon our knees, Under the orange boughs, and prayed together. I never had been happy till that moment.    Vict.  Thou blessed angel!    Prec.     And when thou wast gone I felt an acting here.  I did not speak To any one that day.  But from that day Bartolome grew hateful unto me.    Vict.  Remember him no more.

Edward Lear, the artist, Author of \"Journals of a Landscape Painter\" in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful \"Books of Nonsense,\" which have amused successive generations of children, died on Sunday, January 29, 1888, at San Remo, Italy, where he had lived for twenty years. Few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. Fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. London, Rome, the Mediterranean countries generally, Ceylon and India, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. He was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.  Great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, Lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. His work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the Academy or other exhibitions. His larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. In later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a \"topographical artist;\" and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. He had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. Some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. Sir Roderick Murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in Lear's sketches. The compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.  The history of Lear's choice of a career was a curious one. He was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. As a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history. It occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called Oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. The kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zoölogical draughtsman. Many of the birds in the earlier volumes of Gould's magnificent folios were drawn for him by Lear. A few years back there were eagles alive in the Zoölogical Gardens in Regent's Park to which Lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. He united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. One day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the Zoölogical Gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, \"You must come and draw my birds at Knowsley.\" Lear did not know where Knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth Earl of Derby. The successive Earls of Derby have been among Lear's kindest and most generous patrons. He went to Knowsley, and the drawings in the \"Knowsley Menagerie\" (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by Lear's hand. At Knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. Lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. When English winters began to threaten his health, Lord Derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to Rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among Anglo-Roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous _clientèle_. It was in the Roman summers that Lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of \"Illustrated Excursions in Italy,\" published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his Knowsley patron.  Only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. It was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. Calabria, Sicily, the Desert of Sinai, Egypt and Nubia, Greece and Albania, Palestine, Syria, Athos, Candia, Montenegro, Zagóri (who knows now where Zagóri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of Malta, Corsica, and Corfu. He read insatiably before starting all the recognized guide-books and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the"]]]
