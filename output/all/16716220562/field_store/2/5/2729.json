It has been remarked by Professor Wilhelm Ostwald that the problem of homosexuality is a problem left over to us by the Middle Ages, which for five hundred years dealt with inverts as it dealt with heretics and witches. To regard the matter thus is to emphasize its social and humanitarian interest rather than its biological and psychological significance. It is no doubt this human interest of the question of inversion, rather than its scientific importance, great as the latter is, which is mainly responsible for the remarkable activity with which the study of homosexuality has been carried on during recent years.  The result has been that, during the fourteen years that have passed since the last edition of this _Study_ was issued, so vast an amount of work has been carried on in this field that the preparation of a new edition of the book has been a long and serious task. Nearly every page has been rewritten or enlarged and the Index of Authors consulted has more than doubled in length. The original portions of the book have been still more changed; sixteen new Histories have been added, selected from others in my possession as being varied, typical, and full.  These extensive additions to the volume have rendered necessary various omissions. Many of the shorter and less instructive Histories contained in earlier editions have been omitted, as well as three Appendices which no longer seem of sufficient interest to retain. In order to avoid undue increase in the size of this volume, already much larger than in the previous editions, a new Study of Eonism, or sexo-esthetic inversion, will be inserted in vol. v, where it will perhaps be at least as much in place as here.  HAVELOCK ELLIS.     PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.   It was not my intention to publish a study of an abnormal manifestation of the sexual instinct before discussing its normal manifestations. It has happened, however, that this part of my work is ready first, and, since I thus gain a longer period to develop the central part of my subject, I do not regret the change of plan.  I had not at first proposed to devote a whole volume to sexual inversion. It may even be that I was inclined to slur it over as an unpleasant subject, and one that it was not wise to enlarge on. But I found in time that several persons for whom I felt respect and admiration were the congenital subjects of this abnormality. At the same time I realized that in England, more than in any other country, the law and public opinion combine to place a heavy penal burden and a severe social stigma on the manifestations of an instinct which to those persons who possess it frequently appears natural and normal. It was clear, therefore, that the matter was in special need of elucidation and discussion.  There can be no doubt that a peculiar amount of ignorance exists regarding the subject of sexual inversion. I know medical men of many years' general experience who have never, to their knowledge, come across a single case. We may remember, indeed, that some fifteen years ago the total number of cases recorded in scientific literature scarcely equaled those of British race which I have obtained, and that before my first cases were published not a single British case, unconnected with the asylum or the prison, had ever been recorded. Probably not a very large number of people are even aware that the turning in of the sexual instinct toward persons of the same sex can ever be regarded as inborn, so far as any sexual instinct is inborn. And very few, indeed, would not be surprised if it were possible to publish a list of the names of sexually inverted men and women who at the present time are honorably known in church, state, society, art, or letters. It could not be positively affirmed of all such persons that they were born inverted, but in most the inverted tendency seems to be instinctive, and appears at a somewhat early age. In any case, however, it must be realized that in this volume we are not dealing with subjects belonging to the lunatic asylum, or the prison. We are concerned with individuals who live in freedom, some of them suffering intensely from their abnormal organization, but otherwise ordinary members of society. In a few cases we are concerned with individuals whose moral or artistic ideals have widely influenced their fellows, who know nothing of the peculiar organization which has largely molded those ideals.  I am indebted to several friends for notes, observations, and correspondence on this subject, more especially to one, referred to as \"Z.,\" and to another as \"Q.,\" who have obtained a considerable number of reliable histories for me, and have also supplied many valuable notes; to \"Josiah Flynt\" (whose articles on tramps in _Atlantic Monthly_ and _Harper's Magazine_ have attracted wide attention) for an appendix on homosexuality among tramps; to Drs. Kiernan, Lydston, and Talbot for assistance at various points noted in the text; and to Dr. K., an American woman physician, who kindly assisted me in obtaining cases, and has also supplied an appendix. Other obligations are mentioned in the text.  All those portions of the book which are of medical or medico-legal interest, including most of the cases, have appeared during the last three years in the _Alienist and Neurologist_, the _Journal of Mental Science_, the _Centralblatt für Nervenheilkunde_, the _Medico-legal Journal_, and the _Archivo delle Psicopatie Sessuale_. The cases, as they appear in the present volume, have been slightly condensed, but nothing of genuine psychological interest has been omitted. Owing to some delay in the publication of the English edition of the work, a German translation by my friend, Dr. Hans Kurella, editor of the _Centralblatt für Nervenheilkunde_, has already appeared (1896) in the _Bibliothek für Sozialwissenschaft_. The German edition contains some matter which has finally been rejected from the English edition as of minor importance; on the other hand, much has been added to the English edition, and the whole carefully revised.  I have only to add that if it may seem that I have unduly ignored the cases and arguments brought forward by other writers, it is by no means because I wish to depreciate the valuable work done by my predecessors in this field. It is solely because I have not desired to popularize the results previously reached, but simply to bring forward my own results. If I had not been able to present new facts in what is perhaps a new light, I should not feel justified in approaching the subject of sexual inversion at all.  HAVELOCK ELLIS.

Sexual inversion, as here understood, means sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex. It is thus a narrower term than homosexuality, which includes all sexual attractions between persons of the same sex, even when seemingly due to the accidental absence of the natural objects of sexual attraction, a phenomenon of wide occurrence among all human races and among most of the higher animals. It is only during recent years that sexual inversion has been recognized; previously it was not distinguished from homosexuality in general, and homosexuality was regarded as a national custom, as an individual vice, or as an unimportant episode in grave forms of insanity.[1] We have further to distinguish sexual inversion and all other forms of homosexuality from another kind of inversion which usually remains, so far as the sexual impulse itself is concerned, heterosexual, that is to say, normal. Inversion of this kind leads a person to feel like a person of the opposite sex, and to adopt, so far as possible, the tastes, habits, and dress of the opposite sex, while the direction of the sexual impulse remains normal. This condition I term sexo-esthetic inversion, or Eonism.      The nomenclature of the highly important form of sexual     perversion with which we are here concerned is extremely varied,     and most investigators have been much puzzled in coming to a     conclusion as to the best, most exact, and at the same time most     colorless names to apply to it.      The first in the field in modern times was Ulrichs who, as early     as 1862, used the appellation \"Uranian\" (Uranier), based on the     well-known myth in Plato's _Banquet_. Later he Germanized this     term into \"Urning\" for the male, and \"Urningin\" for the female,     and referred to the condition itself as \"Urningtum.\" He also     invented a number of other related terms on the same basis; some     of these terms have had a considerable vogue, but they are too     fanciful and high-strung to secure general acceptance. If used in     other languages than German they certainly should not be used in     their Germanized shape, and it is scarcely legitimate to use the     term \"Urning\" in English. \"Uranian\" is more correct.      In Germany the first term accepted by recognized scientific     authorities was \"contrary sexual feeling\" (Konträre     Sexualempfindung). It was devised by Westphal in 1869, and used     by Krafft-Ebing and Moll. Though thus accepted by the earliest     authorities in this field, and to be regarded as a fairly     harmless and vaguely descriptive term, it is somewhat awkward,     and is now little used in Germany; it was never currently used     outside Germany. It has been largely superseded by the term     \"homosexuality.\" This also was devised (by a little-known     Hungarian doctor, Benkert, who used the pseudonym Kertbeny) in     the same year (1869), but at first attracted no attention. It     has, philologically, the awkward disadvantage of being a bastard     term compounded of Greek and Latin elements, but its     significance--sexual attraction to the same sex--is fairly clear     and definite, while it is free from any question-begging     association of either favorable or unfavorable character. (Edward     Carpenter has proposed to remedy its bastardly linguistic     character by transforming it into \"homogenic;\" this, however,     might mean not only \"toward the same sex,\" but \"of the same     kind,\" and in German already possesses actually that meaning.)     The term \"homosexual\" has the further advantage that on account     of its classical origin it is easily translatable into many     languages. It is now the most widespread general term for the     phenomena we are dealing with, and it has been used by     Hirschfeld, now the chief authority in this field, as the title     of his encyclopedic work, _Die Homosexualität_.      \"Sexual Inversion\" (in French \"inversion sexuelle,\" and in     Italian \"inversione sessuale\") is the term which has from the     first been chiefly used in France and Italy, ever since Charcot     and Magnan, in 1882, published their cases of this anomaly in the     _Archives de Neurologie_. It had already been employed in Italy     by Tamassia in the _Revista Sperimentale di Freniatria_, in 1878.     I have not discovered when and where the term \"sexual inversion\"     was first used. Possibly it first appeared in English, for long     before the paper of Charcot and Magnan I have noticed, in an     anonymous review of Westphal's first paper in the _Journal of     Mental Science_ (then edited by Dr. Maudsley) for October, 1871,     that \"Conträre Sexualempfindung\" is translated as \"inverted     sexual proclivity.\" So far as I am aware, \"sexual inversion\" was     first used in English, as the best term, by J.A. Symonds in 1883,     in his privately printed essay, _A Problem in Greek Ethics_.     Later, in 1897, the same term was adopted, I believe for the     first time publicly in English, in the present work.      It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other names which have     been proposed. (A discussion of the nomenclature will be found in     the first chapter of Hirschfeld's work, _Die Homosexualität_, and     of some special terms in an article by Schouten,     _Sexual-Probleme_, December, 1912.) It may suffice to mention the     ancient theological and legal term \"sodomy\" (sodomia) because it     is still the most popular term for this perversion, though, it     must be remembered, it has become attached to the physical act of     intercourse _per anum_, even when carried out heterosexually, and     has little reference to psychic sexual proclivity. This term has     its origin in the story (narrated in Genesis, ch. xix) of Lot's     visitors whom the men of Sodom desired to have intercourse with,     and of the subsequent destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This     story furnishes a sufficiently good ground for the use of the     term, though the Jews do not regard sodomy as the sin of Sodom,     but rather inhospitality and hardness of heart to the poor (J.     Preuss, _Biblisch-Talmudische Medizin_, pp. 579-81), and     Christian theologians also, both Catholic and Protestant (see,     e.g., _Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. iv, p. 199,     and Hirschfeld, _Homosexualität_, p. 742), have argued that it     was not homosexuality, but their other offenses, which provoked     the destruction of the Cities of the Plain. In Germany \"sodomy\"     has long been used to denote bestiality, or sexual intercourse     with animals, but this use of the term is quite unjustified. In     English there is another term, \"buggery,\" identical in meaning     with sodomy, and equally familiar. \"Bugger\" (in French,     _bougre_) is a corruption of \"Bulgar,\" the ancient Bulgarian     heretics having been popularly supposed to practise this     perversion. The people of every country have always been eager to     associate sexual perversions with some other country than their     own.      The terms usually adopted in the present volume are \"sexual     inversion\" and \"homosexuality.\" The first is used more especially     to indicate that the sexual impulse is organically and innately     turned toward individuals of the same sex. The second is used     more comprehensively of the general phenomena of sexual     attraction between persons of the same sex, even if only of a     slight and temporary character. It may be admitted that there is     no precise warrant for any distinction of this kind between the     two terms. The distinction in the phenomena is, however, still     generally recognized; thus Iwan Bloch applies the term     \"homosexuality\" to the congenital form, and     \"pseudo-homosexuality\" to its spurious or simulated forms. Those     persons who are attracted to both sexes are now usually termed     \"bisexual,\" a more convenient term than \"psycho-sexual     hermaphrodite,\" which was formerly used. There remains the normal     person, who is \"heterosexual.\"  Before approaching the study of sexual inversion in cases which we may investigate with some degree of scientific accuracy, there is interest in glancing briefly at the phenomena as they appear before us, as yet scarcely or at all differentiated, among animals, among various human races, and at various periods.  Among animals in a domesticated or confined state it is easy to find evidence of homosexual attraction, due merely to the absence of the other sex.[2] This was known to the ancients; the Egyptians regarded two male partridges as the symbol of homosexuality, and Aristotle noted that two female pigeons would cover each other if no male was at hand. Buffon observed many examples, especially among birds. He found that, if male or female birds of various species--such as partridges, fowls, and doves--were shut up together, they would soon begin to have sexual relations among themselves, the males sooner and more frequently than the females. More recently Sainte-Claire Deville observed that dogs, rams, and bulls, when isolated, first became restless and dangerous, and then acquired a permanent state of sexual excitement, not obeying the laws of heat, and leading them to attempts to couple together; the presence of the opposite sex at once restored them to normal conditions.[3] Bombarda of Lisbon states that in Portugal it is well known that in every herd of bulls there is nearly always one bull who is ready to lend himself to the perverted whims of his companions.[4] It may easily be observed how a cow in heat exerts an exciting influence on other cows, impelling them to attempt to play the bull's part.
