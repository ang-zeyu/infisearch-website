TO  Mrs. SARAH     ) Mrs. MARY _and_) ABNEY, Mrs. ELIZABETH )  _Daughters of Sir_ THOMAS ABNEY, _Kt. and Alderman of London_.   _My Dear Young Friends_,  Whom I am constrained to love and honour by many Obligations. It was the generous and condescending Friendship of your Parents under my weak Circumstances of Health, that brought me to their Country-Seat for the Benefit of the Air; but it was an Instance of most uncommon Kindness, to supply me there so chearfully for two Years of Sickness with the richest Conveniences of Life. Such a Favour requires my most affectionate Returns of Service to themselves, and to all that is dear to them; and meer Gratitude demands some solemn and publick Acknowledgment.  But great Minds have the true Relish and Pleasure of doing Good, and are content to be unknown.  It is such a silent Satisfaction Sir _Thomas Abney_ enjoys in the unspeakable Blessings of this Year, that brought our present King to the Throne: and he permits the World to forget that happy Turn that was given to the Affairs of the Kingdom by his wise Management in the Highest Office of the City, whereby the Settlement of the Crown was so much strengthen'd in the Illustrious Family which now possesses it. O may the Crown flourish many Years on the Head of our Soveraign, and may his House possess it to the End of Time, to secure all Religious and Civil Liberties to the Posterity of those who have been so zealous to establish this Succession!  The fair and lovely Character your Honoured Father hath acquired by passing thro' all the chief Offices of the City, and leaving a Lustre upon them, seems imperfect in his own Esteem, without the Addition of this Title, _A Succourer and a Friend of the Ministers of Christ_. And in this part of his Honour the Lady your Mother is resolved to have an unborrow'd Share, and becomes his daily Rival.  It is to her unwearied Tenderness, and many kind Offices by Night and Day, in the more violent Seasons of my Indisposition, that (under God) I own my Life, and Power to write or think. And while I remember those Hours, I can't forget the cheerful and ready Attendance of her worthy Sister, her dear Companion and Assistant in every good Work.  Under the Influence of two such Examples I have also enjoy'd the Pleasure and Conveniency of your younger Services, according to the Capacity of your Years; and that with such a Degree of sincere and hearty Zeal for my Welfare, that you are ready to vie with each other in the kind Imployment, and assist all you can toward my Recovery and Usefulness. So that whoever shall reap benefit by any of my Labours, it is but a reasonable Request, that you share with me in their Thanks and their Prayers.  But this is a small Part of your Praise.  If it would not be suspected of Flattery, I could tell the World what an Acquaintance with Scripture, what a Knowledge of Religion, what a Memory of Divine things both in Verse and Prose is found among you; and what a just and regular account is given of Sermons at your Age; to awaken all the Children that shall read these _Songs_, to furnish their memories and beautify their Souls like yours. The Honour you have done me in learning by heart so large a number of the _Hymns_ I have publish'd, perhaps has been of some use towards these greater Improvements, and gives me rich Encouragement to offer you this little Present.  Since I have ventured to shew a Part of your early Character to the World, I perswade my self you will remember, that it must inlarge and brighten daily. Remember what the World will expect from the Daughters of Sir _Thomas Abney's_ Family, under such an Education, such Examples, and after such fair and promising Blossoms of Piety and Goodness. Remember what God himself will expect at your hands, from whose Grace you have received plentiful Distributions in the Beginning of your Days. May the Blessings of his Right Hand more enrich you daily, as your Capacities and your Years increase; and may he add bountifully of the Favours of his Left Hand, Riches and Honour. May his Grace make you so large a Return of all the Kindness I have received in your Family, as may prevail above the fondest Hopes of your Parents, and even exceed the warmest Prayers of  _Your most Affectionate Monitor and obliged Servant in the daily Views of a future World_,   I. WATTS.  Theobalds,  June 18. 1715.   PREFACE To all that are concerned in the Education of Children.    My Friends,  It is an awful and important charge that is committed to you. The wisdom and welfare of the succeeding generation are intrusted with you beforehand, and depend much on your conduct. The seeds of misery or happiness in this world, and that to come, are oftentimes sown very early, and therefore whatever may conduce to give the minds of children a relish for vertue and religion, ought in the first place to be proposed to you.  Verse was at first design'd for the service of God, tho' it hath been wretchedly abused since. The ancients among the Jews and the Heathens taught their children and disciples the precepts of morality and worship in verse. The children of Israel were commanded to learn the words of the song of Moses, Deut. 31. 19,30. And we are directed in the New Testament, not only to sing with grace in the heart, but to teach and admonish one another by hymns and songs, Eph. 5. 19. and there are these four advantages in it:  1. There is a greater delight in the very learning of truths and duties this way. There is something so amusing and entertaining in rhymes and metre, that will incline children to make this part of their business a diversion. And you may turn their very duty into a reward, by giving them the privilege of learning one of these songs every week, if they fulfil the business of the week well, and promising them the book itself when they have learned ten or twenty songs out of it.  2. What is learnt in verse is longer retained in memory, and sooner recollected. The like sounds and the like number of syllables exceedingly assist the remembrance. And it may often happen, that the end of a song running in the mind may be an effectual means to keep off some temptation, or to incline to some duty, when a word of scripture is not upon the thoughts.  3. This will be a constant furniture for the minds of children, that they may have something to think upon when alone, and sing over to themselves. This may sometimes give their thoughts a divine turn, and raise a young meditation. Thus they will not be forced to seek relief for an emptiness of mind out of the loose and dangerous sonnets of the age.  4. These _Divine Songs_ may be a pleasant and proper matter for their daily or weekly worship, to sing one in the family at such time as the parents or governors shall appoint; and therefore I have confin'd the verse to the most usual psalm tunes.  The greatest part of this little book was composed several years ago, at the request of a friend, who has been long engaged in the work of catechising a very great number of children of all kinds, and with abundant skill and success. So that you will find here nothing that savours of a party: the children of high and low degree, of the Church of England or Dissenters, baptized in infancy or not, may all join together in these songs. And as I have endeavoured to sink the language to the level of a child's understanding, and yet to keep it (if possible) above contempt; so I have designed to profit all (if possible) and offend none. I hope the more general the sense is, these composures may be of the more universal use and service.  I have added at the end an attempt or two of _Sonnets_ on _Moral Subjects_ for children, with an air of pleasantry, to provoke some fitter pen to write a little book of them. My talent doth not lie that way, and a man on the borders of the grave has other work. Besides, if I had health or leisure to lay out this way, it should be employ'd in finishing the _Psalms_, which I have so long promised the world.  May the Almighty God make you faithful in this important work of education: may he succeed your cares with his abundant graces, that the rising generation of Great Britain may be a glory amongst the nations, a pattern to the Christian world, and a blessing to the earth.    Divine Songs  For  Children.   Song 1. _A General Song of Praise to God_.  1 How glorious is our Heavenly King, Who reigns above the sky! How shall a child presume to sing His dreadful majesty?  2 How great his power is none can tell, Nor think how large his grace; Not men below, nor saints that dwell On high before his face.  3 Not angels that stand round the Lord Can search his secret will; But they perform his heavenly word, And sing his praises still.  4 Then let me join this holy train, And my first offerings bring; Th' eternal God will not disdain To hear an infant sing.  5 My heart resolves, my tongue obeys, And angels shall rejoice To hear their mighty Maker's praise Sound from a feeble voice.   Song 2. _Praise for Creation and Providence_.  1 I sing th' almighty power of God, That made the mountains rise, That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies.  2 I sing the wisdom that ordain'd The sun to rule the day; The moon shines full at his command, And all the stars obey.  3 I sing the goodness of the Lord, That fill'd the earth with food; He form'd the creatures with his Word, And then pronounced them good.  4 Lord, how thy wonders are display'd Where'er I turn mine eye, If I survey the ground I tread, Or gaze upon the sky.  5 There's not a plant or flower"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13439"],["title","Divine Songs (#1)"],["body","But makes thy glories known; And clouds arise and tempests blow By order from thy throne.  6 Creatures (as num'rous as they be) Are subject to thy care: There's not a place where we can flee, But God is present there.  7 In heaven he shines with beams of love, With wrath in hell beneath: 'Tis on his earth I stand or move, And 'tis his air I breathe.  8 His hand is my perpetual guard, He keeps me with his eye: Why should I then forget the Lord Who is for ever nigh?   Song 3. _Praise to God for our Redemption_.  1 Blest be the wisdom and the power, The justice and the grace, That join'd in council to restore And save our ruin'd race!  2 Our father eat forbidden fruit, And from his glory fell; And we, his children, thus were brought To death, and near to hell.  3 Blest be the Lord, that sent his Son To take our flesh and blood; He for our lives gave up his own, To make our peace with God.  4 He honour'd all his Father's laws, Which we have disobey'd; He bore our sins upon the cross, And our full ransom paid.  5 Behold him rising from the grave; Behold him rais'd on high: He pleads his merits there to save Transgressors doom'd to die.  6 There on a glorious throne, he reigns, And by his power divine Redeems us from the slavish chains Of Satan, and of sin.  7 Thence shall the Lord to judgment come, And, with a sovereign voice, Shall call, and break up every tomb, While waking saints rejoice.  8 O may I then with joy appear Before the Judge's face, And, with the blest assembly there, Sing his redeeming grace!   Song 4. _Praise for Mercies Spiritual and Temporal_.  1 Whene'er I take my walks abroad, How many poor I see? What shall I render to my God For all his gifts to me?  2 Not more than others I deserve, Yet God hath given me more; For I have food, while others starve, Or beg from door to door.  3 How many children in the street Half naked I behold? While I am clothed from head to feet, And cover'd from the cold.  4 While some poor wretches scarce can tell Where they may lay their head, I have a home wherein to dwell, And rest upon my bed.  5 While others early learn to swear, And curse, and lie, and steal, Lord, I am taught thy name to fear, And do thy holy will.  6 Are these thy favours, day by day To me above the rest? Then let me love thee more than they, And try to serve thee best.   Song 5. _Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land_.  1 Great God, to thee my voice I raise, To thee my youngest hours belong; I would begin my life with praise, Till growing years improve the song.  2 'Tis to thy soveraign grace I owe, That I was born on Brittish ground, Where streams of heavenly mercy flow, And words of sweet salvation sound.  3 I would not change my native land For rich Peru, with all her gold: A nobler prize lies in my hand Than East or Western Indies hold.  4 How do I pity those that dwell Where ignorance and darkness reigns; They know no heav'n, they fear no hell, Those endless joys, those endless pains.  5 Thy glorious promises, O Lord, Kindle my hope and my desire; While all the preachers of thy word Warn me t' escape eternal fire.  6 Thy praise shall still employ my breath, Since thou hast mark'd my way to heaven; Nor will I run the road to death, And wast the blessings thou hast given.   Song 6. _Praise for the Gospel_.  1 Lord, I ascribe it to thy grace, And not to chance as others do, That I was born of Christian race, And not a Heathen, or a Jew.  2 What would the ancient Jewish kings, And Jewish prophets once have given, Could they have heard these glorious things, Which Christ reveal'd, and brought from heav'n!  3 How glad the Heathens would have been, That worship idols, wood, and stone, If they the book of God had seen, Or Jesus and his gospel known!  4 Then if the Gospel I refuse, How shall I e'er lift up mine eyes? For all the Gentiles and the Jews Against me will in judgment rise.   Song 7. _The Excellency of the Bible_.  1 Great God, with wonder and with praise, On all thy works I look; But still thy wisdom, power and grace Shine brighter in thy Book.  2 The stars that in their courses roll, Have much instruction given; But thy good Word informs my soul How I may climb to heaven.  3 The fields provide me food, and show The goodness of the Lord; But fruits of life and glory grow In thy most holy Word.  4 Here are my choicest treasures hid, Here my best comfort lies; Here my desires are satisfy'd; And hence my hopes arise.  5 Lord, make me understand thy law, Show what my faults have been; And from thy Gospel let me draw Pardon for all my sin.  6 Here would I learn how Christ has dy'd To save my soul from hell: Not all the books on earth beside Such heav'nly wonders tell.  7 Then let me love my Bible more, And take a fresh delight By day to read these wonders o'er, And meditate by night.   Song 8. _Praise to God for learning to read_.  1 The praises of my tongue I offer to the Lord, That I was taught, and learnt so young To read his holy Word.  2 That I am taught to know The danger I was in, By nature and by practice too A wretched slave to sin.  3 That I am led to see I can do nothing well; And whither shall a sinner flee, To save himself from hell?  4 Dear Lord, this book of thine Informs me where to go For grace to pardon all my sin, And make me holy too.  5 Here I can read and learn How Christ the Son of God Did undertake our great concern, Our ransom cost his blood.  6 And now he reigns above, He sends his Spirit down, To show the wonders of his love, And make his Gospel known.  7 O may that Spirit teach, And make my heart receive Those truths which all thy servants preach, And all thy saints believe!  8 Then shall I praise the Lord In a more chearful strain, That I was taught to read his Word, And have not learnt in vain.   Song 9. The All-Seeing God.  1 Almighty God, thy piercing eye Strikes through the shades of night, And our most secret actions lie All open to thy sight.  2 There's not a sin that we commit, Nor wicked word we say, But in thy dreadful book `tis writ Against the judgment-day.  3 And must the crimes that I have done Be read and publish'd there, Be all exposed before the sun, While men and angels hear?  4 Lord, at thy feet ashamed I lie, Upward I dare not look; Pardon my sins before I die, And blot them from thy book.  5 Remember all the dying pains That my Redeemer felt, And let his blood wash out my stains, And answer for my guilt.  6 O may I now for ever fear T' indulge a sinful thought, Since the great God can see, and hear, And writes down every fault!   Song 10. _Solemn Thoughts of God and Death_.  1 There is a God that reigns above, Lord of the heavens, and earth, and seas: I fear his wrath, I ask his love, And with my lips I sing his praise.  2 There is a law which he has writ, To teach us all what we must do; My soul, to his commands submit, For they are holy, just and true.  3 There is a Gospel of rich grace, Whence sinners all their comfort draw; Lord, I repent, and seek thy face; For I have often broke thy law.  4 There is an hour when I must die, Nor do I know how soon `twill come; A thousand children young as I Are call'd by death to hear their doom.  5 Let me improve the hours I have Before the day of grace is fled; There's no repentance in the grave, No pardons offer'd to the dead.  6 Just as a tree cut down, that fell To north, or southward, there it lies: So man departs to heaven or hell, Fix'd in the state wherein he dies.   Song 11. _Heaven and Hell_.  1 There is beyond the sky A heaven of joy and love, And holy children, when they die, Go to that world above.  2 There is a dreadful hell, And everlasting pains, There sinners must with devils dwell In darkness, fire, and chains.  3 Can such a wretch as I Escape this cursed end? And may I hope, whene'er I die, I shall to heaven ascend?  4 Then will I read and pray While I have life and breath; Lest I should be cut off to day, And sent t' eternal death.   Song 12. _The Advantages of early Religion_.  1 Happy's the child whose youngest years Receive instruction well; Who hates the sinner's path, and fears The road that leads to hell.  2 When we devote our youth to God, 'Tis pleasing in his eyes; A flower, when offer'd in the bud, Is no vain sacrifice.  3 'Tis easier work if we begin To fear the Lord betimes; While sinners that grow old in sin Are hard'ned in their crimes.  4 'Twill save us from a thousand snares To mind religion young; Grace will preserve our following years And make our vertue strong.  5 To thee, Almighty God, to thee Our childhood we resign; 'Twill please us to look back and see That our whole lives were thine.  6 Let the sweet work of prayer and praise, Employ my youngest breath; Thus I'm prepar'd for longer days, Or fit for early death.   Song 13. _The Danger of Delay_.  1 Why should I say, \"`Tis yet too soon \"To seek for heaven or think of death?\" A flower may fade before `tis noon, And I this day may lose my breath.  2 If this rebellious heart of mine, Despise the gracious calls of Heaven; I may be hard'ned in my sin, And never have repentance given.  3 What if the Lord grow wroth, and swear While I refuse to read and pray, That he'll refuse to lend an ear, To all my groans another day?  4 What if his dreadful anger burn, While I refuse his offer'd grace, And all his love to fury turn, And strike me dead upon the place?  5 'Tis dangerous to provoke a God; His power and vengeance none can tell: One stroke of his almighty rod Shall send young sinners quick to hell.  6 Then `twill for ever be in vain To cry for pardon or for grace, To wish I had my time again, Or hope to see my Maker's face.   Song 14. _Examples of early piety_.  1 What blest examples do I find Writ in the Word of Truth, Of children that began to mind Religion in their youth.  2 Jesus, who reigns above the skie, And keeps the world in awe; Was once a child as young as I, And kept his Father's law.  3 At twelve years old he talk'd with men, (The Jews all wondering stand;) Yet he obey'd his Mother then, And "]]]
