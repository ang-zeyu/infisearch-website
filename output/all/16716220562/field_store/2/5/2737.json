Estrus has since     been fully discussed in Marshall's _Physiology of Reproduction_.)     This description clearly brings out the fundamentally vascular     character of the process I have termed \"tumescence\"; it must be     added, however, that in man the nervous elements in the process     tend to become more conspicuous, and more or less obliterate     these primitive limitations of sexual desire. (See \"Sexual     Periodicity\" in the first volume of these _Studies_.)      Moll subsequently restated his position with reference to my     somewhat different analysis of the sexual impulse, still     maintaining his original view (\"Analyse des Geschlechtstriebes,\"     _Medizinische Klinik_, Nos. 12 and 13, 1905; also _Geschlecht und     Gesellschaft_, vol. ii, Nos. 9 and 10). Numa Praetorius     (_Jahrbuch für Sexeuelle Zwischenstufen_, 1904, p. 592) accepts     contrectation, tumescence, and detumescence as all being stages     in the same process, contrectation, which he defines as the     sexual craving for a definite individual, coming first. Robert     Müller (_Sexualbiologie_, 1907, p. 37) criticises Moll much in     the same sense as I have done and considers that contrectation     and detumescence cannot be separated, but are two expressions of     the same impulse; so also Max Katte, \"Die Präliminarien des     Geschlechtsaktes,\" _Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft_, Oct.,     1908, and G. Saint-Paul, _L'Homosexualité et les Types     Homosexuels_, 1910, p. 390.      While I regard Moll's analysis as a valuable contribution to the     elucidation of the sexual impulse, I must repeat that I cannot     regard it as final or completely adequate. As I understand the     process, contrectation is an incident in the development of     tumescence, an extremely important incident indeed, but not an     absolutely fundamental and primitive part of it. It is equally an     incident, highly important though not primitive and fundamental,     of detumescence. Contrectation, from first to last; furnishes     the best conditions for the exercise of the sexual process, but     it is not an absolutely essential part of the process and in the     early stages of zoölogical development it had no existence at     all. Tumescence and detumescence are alike fundamental,     primitive, and essential; in resting the sexual impulse on these     necessarily connected processes we are basing ourselves on the     solid bedrock of nature.      Moreover, of the two processes, tumescence, which in time comes     first, is by far the most important, and nearly the whole of     sexual psychology is rooted in it. To assert, with Moll, that the     sexual process may be analyzed into contrectation and     detumescence alone is to omit the most essential part of the     process. It is much the same as to analyze the mechanism of a gun     into probable contact with the hand, and a more or less     independent discharge, omitting all reference to the loading of     the gun. The essential elements are the loading and the     discharging. Contrectation is a part of loading, though not a     necessary part, since the loading may be effected mechanically.     But to understand the process of firing a gun and to comprehend     the mechanism of the discharge, we must insist on the act of     loading and not merely on the contact of the hand. So it is in     analyzing the sexual impulse. Contrectation is indeed highly     important, but it is important only in so far as it aids     tumescence, and so may be subordinated to tumescence, exactly as     it may also be subordinated to detumescence. It is tumescence     which is the really essential part of the process, and we cannot     afford, with Moll, to ignore it altogether.  Wallace opposed Darwin's theory of sexual selection, but it can scarcely be said that his attitude toward it bears critical examination. On the one hand, as has already been noted, he saw but one side of that theory and that the unessential side, and, on the other hand, his own view really coincided with the more essential elements in Darwin's theory. In his _Tropical Nature_ he admitted that the male's \"persistency and energy win the day,\" and also that this \"vigor and liveliness\" of the male are usually associated with intense coloration, while twenty years later (in his _Darwinism_) he admitted also that it is highly probable that the female is pleased or excited by the male's display. But all that is really essential in Darwin's theory is involved, directly or indirectly, in these admissions.  Espinas, in 1878, in his suggestive book, _Des Sociétés Animales_, described the odors, colors and forms, sounds, games, parades, and mock battles of animals, approaching the subject in a somewhat more psychological spirit than either Darwin or Wallace, and he somewhat more clearly apprehended the object of these phenomena in producing mutual excitement and stimulating tumescence. He noted the significance of the action of the hermaphroditic snails in inserting their darts into each other's flesh near the vulva in order to cause preliminary excitation. He remarks of this whole group of phenomena: \"It is the preliminary of sexual union, it constitutes the first act of it. By it the image of the male is graven on the consciousness of the female, and in a manner impregnates it, so as to determine there, as the effects of this representation descend to the depths of the organism, the physiological modifications necessary to fecundation.\" Beaunis, again, in an analysis of the sexual sensations, was inclined to think that the dances and parades of the male are solely intended to excite the female, not perceiving, however, that they at the same time serve to further excite the male also.[24]  A better and more comprehensive statement was reached by Tillier, who, to some extent, may be said to have anticipated Groos. Darwin, Tillier pointed out, had not sufficiently taken into account the coexistence of combat and courtship, nor the order of the phenomena. Courtship without combat, Tillier argued, is rare; \"there is a normal coexistence of combat and courtship.\"[25] Moreover, he proceeded, force is the chief factor in determining the possession of the female by the male, who in some species is even prepared to exert force on her; so that the female has little opportunity of sexual selection, though she is always present at these combats. He then emphasized the significant fact that courtship takes place long after pairing has ceased, and the question of selection thus been eliminated. The object of courtship, he concluded, is not sexual selection by the female, but the sexual excitement of both male and female, such excitement, he asserted, not only rendering coupling easier, but favoring fecundation. Modesty, also, Tillier further argued, again anticipating Groos, works toward the same end; it renders the male more ardent, and by retarding coupling may also increase the secretions of the sexual glands and favor the chances of reproduction.[26]      In a charming volume entitled _The Naturalist in La Plata_ (1892)     Mr. W.H. Hudson included a remarkable chapter on \"Music and     Dancing in Nature.\" In this chapter he described many of the     dances, songs, and love-antics of birds, but regarded all such     phenomena as merely \"periodical fits of gladness.\" While,     however, we may quite well agree with Mr. Hudson that conscious     sexual gratification on the part of the female is not the cause     of music and dancing performances in birds, nor of the brighter     colors and ornaments that distinguish the male, such an opinion     by no means excludes the conclusion that these phenomena are     primarily sexual and intimately connected with the process of     tumescence in both sexes. It is noteworthy that, according to     H.E. Howard (\"On Sexual Selection in Birds,\" _Zoölogist_, Nov.,     1903), color is most developed just before pairing, rapidly     becoming less beautiful--even within a few hours--after this, and     the most beautiful male is most successful in getting paired. The     fact that, as Mr. Hudson himself points out, it is at the season     of love that these manifestations mainly, if not exclusively,     appear, and that it is the more brilliant and highly endowed     males which play the chief part in them, only serves to confirm     such a conclusion. To argue, with Mr. Hudson, that they cannot be     sexual because they sometimes occur before the arrival of the     females, is much the same as to argue that the antics of a     kitten with a feather or a reel have no relationship whatever to     mice. The birds that began earliest to practise their     accomplishments would probably have most chance of success when     the females arrived. Darwin himself said that nothing is commoner     than for animals to take pleasure in practising whatever instinct     they follow at other times for some real good. These     manifestations are primarily for the sake of producing sexual     tumescence, and could not well have been developed to the height     they have reached unless they were connected closely with     propagation. That they may incidentally serve to express     \"gladness\" one need not feel called upon to question.      Another observer of birds, Mr. E. Selous, has made observations     which are of interest in this connection. He finds that all     bird-dances are not nuptial, but that some birds--the     stone-curlew (or great plover), for example--have different kinds     of dances. Among these birds he has made the observation, very     significant from our present point of view, that the nuptial     dances, taken part in by both of the pair, are immediately     followed by intercourse. In spring \"all such runnings and     chasings are, at this time, but a part of the business of     pairing, and one divines at once that such attitudes are of a     sexual character...."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#8)"],["body","we have a bird with distinct nuptial     (sexual) and social (non-sexual) forms of display or antics, and     the former as well as the latter are equally indulged in by both     sexes.\" (E. Selous, _Bird Watching_, pp. 15-20.)      The same author (ibid., pp. 79, 94) argues that in the fights of     two males for one female--with violent emotion on one side and     interested curiosity on the other--the attitude of the former     \"might gradually come to be a display made entirely for the     female, and of the latter a greater or less degree of pleasurable     excitement raised by it, with a choice in accordance.\" On this     view the interest of the female would first have been directed,     not to the plumage, but to the frenzied actions and antics of the     male. From these antics in undecorated birds would gradually     develop the interest in waving plumes and fluttering wings. Such     a dance might come to be of a quite formal and non-courting     nature.      Last, we owe to Professor Häcker what may fairly be regarded, in     all main outlines, as an almost final statement of the matter. In     his _Gesang der Vögel_ (1900) he gives a very clear account of     the evolution of bird-song, which he regards as the most     essential element in all this group of manifestations, furnishing     the key also to the dancing and other antics. Originally the song     consists only of call-cries and recognition-notes. Under the     parallel influence of natural selection and sexual selection they     become at the pairing season reflexes of excitement and thus     develop into methods of producing excitement, in the male by the     muscular energy required, and in the female through the ear;     finally they become play, though here also it is probable that     use is not excluded. Thus, so far as the male bird is concerned,     bird-song possesses a primary prenuptial significance in     attracting the female, a secondary nuptial significance in     producing excitement (p. 48). He holds also that the     less-developed voices of the females aid in attaining the same     end (p. 51). Finally, bird-song possesses a tertiary extranuptial     significance (including exercise play, expression of gladness).     Häcker points out, at the same time, that the maintenance of some     degree of sexual excitement beyond pairing time may be of value     for the preservation of the species, in case of disturbance     during breeding and consequent necessity for commencing breeding     over again.      Such a theory as this fairly coincides with the views brought     forward in the preceding pages,--views which are believed to be     in harmony with the general trend of thought today,--since it     emphasizes the importance of tumescence and all that favors     tumescence in the sexual process. The so-called esthetic element     in sexual selection is only indirectly of importance. The male's     beauty is really a symbol of his force.      It will be seen that this attitude toward the facts of tumescence     among birds and other animals includes the recognition of dances,     songs, etc., as expressions of \"gladness.\" As such they are     closely comparable to the art manifestations among human races.     Here, as Weismann in his _Gedanken über Musik_ has remarked, we     may regard the artistic faculty as a by-product: \"This [musical]     faculty is, as it were, the mental hand with which we play on our     own emotional nature, a hand not shaped for this purpose, not due     to the necessity for the enjoyment of music, but owing its origin     to entirely different requirements.\"  The psychological significance of these facts has been carefully studied and admirably developed by Groos in his classic works on the play instinct in animals and in men.[27] Going beyond Wallace, Groos denies _conscious_ sexual selection, but, as he points out, this by no means involves the denial of unconscious selection in the sense that \"the female is most easily won by the male who most strongly excites her sexual instincts.\" Groos further quotes a pregnant generalization of Ziegler: \"In all animals a high degree of excitement of the nervous system is _necessary to procreation_, and thus we find an excited prelude to procreation widely spread.\"[28] Such a stage, indeed, as Groos points out, is usually necessary before any markedly passionate discharge of motor energy, as may be observed in angry dogs and the Homeric heroes. While, however, in other motor explosions the prelude may be reduced to a minimum, in courtship it is found in a highly marked degree. The primary object of courtship, Groos insists, is to produce sexual excitement.  It is true that Groos's main propositions were by no means novel. Thus, as I have pointed out, he was at most points anticipated by Tillier. But Groos developed the argument in so masterly a manner, and with so many wide-ranging illustrations, that he has carried conviction where the mere insight of others had passed unperceived. Since Darwin wrote the _Descent of Man_ the chief step in the development of the theory of sexual selection has been taken by Groos, who has at the same time made it clear that sexual selection is largely a special case of natural selection.[29] The conjunction of the sexes is seen to be an end only to be obtained with much struggle; the difficulty of achieving sexual erethism in both sexes, the difficulty of so stimulating such erethism in the female that her instinctive coyness is overcome, these difficulties the best and most vigorous males,[30] those most adapted in other respects to carry on the race, may most easily overcome. In this connection we may note what Marro has said in another connection, when attempting to answer the question why it is that among savages courtship becomes so often a matter in which persuasion takes the form of force. The explanation, he remarks, is yet very simple. Force is the foundation of virility, and its psychic manifestation is courage. In the struggle for life violence is the first virtue. The modesty of women--in its primordial form consisting in physical resistance, active or passive, to the assaults of the male--aided selection by putting to the test man's most important quality, force. Thus it is that when choosing among rivals for her favors a woman attributes value to violence.[31] Marro thus independently confirms the result reached by Groos.  The debate which has for so many years been proceeding concerning the validity of the theory of sexual selection may now be said to be brought to an end. Those who supported Darwin and those who opposed him were, both alike, in part right and in part wrong, and it is now possible to combine the elements of truth on either side into a coherent whole. This is now beginning to be widely recognized; Lloyd Morgan,[32] for instance, has readjusted his position as regards the \"pairing instinct\" in the light of Groos's contribution to the subject. \"The hypothesis of sexual selection,\" he concludes, \"suggests that the accepted male is the one which adequately evokes the pairing impulse.... Courtship may thus be regarded from the physiological point of view as a means of producing the requisite amount of pairing hunger; of stimulating the whole system and facilitating general and special vascular changes; of creating that state of profound and explosive irritability which has for its psychological concomitant or antecedent an imperious and irresistible craving.... Courtship is thus the strong and steady bending of the bow that the arrow may find its mark in a biological end of the highest importance in the survival of a healthy and vigorous race.\"      Having thus viewed the matter broadly, we may consider in detail     a few examples of the process of tumescence among the lower     animals and man, for, as will be seen, the process in both is     identical. As regards animal courtship, the best treasury of     facts is Brehm's _Thierleben_, while Büchner's _Liebe und     Liebes-Leben in der Thierwelt_ is a useful summary; the admirable     discussion of bird-dancing and other forms of courtship in     Häcker's _Gesang der Vögel_, chapter iv, may also be consulted.     As regards man, Wallaschek's _Primitive Music_, chapter vii,     brings together much scattered material, and is all the more     valuable since the author rejects any form of sexual selection;     Hirn's _Origins of Art_, chapter xvii, is well worth reading, and     Finck's _Primitive Love and Love-stories_ contains a large amount     of miscellaneous information. I have preferred not to draw on any     of these easily accessible sources (except that in one or two     cases I have utilized references they supplied), but here simply     furnish illustrations met with in the course of my own reading.      Even in the hermaphroditic slugs (_Limax maximus_) the process of     courtship is slow and elaborate. It has been described by James     Bladon (\"The Loves of the Slug [_Limax cinereus_],\" _Zoölogist_,     vol. xv, 1857, p. 6272). It begins toward midnight on sultry     summer nights, one slug slowly following another, resting its     mouth on what may be called the tail of the first, and following     its every movement. Finally they stop and begin crawling around     each other, emitting large quantities of mucus. When this has     constituted a mass of sufficient size and consistence they     suspend themselves from it by a cord of mucus from nine to     fifteen inches in length, continuing to turn round each other     till their bodies form a cone. Then the organs of generation are     protruded from their orifice near the mouth and, hanging down a     short distance, touch each other. They also then begin again the     same spiral motion, twisting around each other, like a two-strand     cord, assuming various and beautiful forms, sometimes like an     inverted agaric, or a foliated murex, or a leaf of curled     parsley, the"]]]
