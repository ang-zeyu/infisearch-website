Seeking the pastures of Christ the Shepherd, Cant. 1.7.  1 Thou whom my soul admires above All earthly joy, and earthly love, Tell me, dear shepherd, let me know, Where doth thy sweetest pasture grow?  2 Where is the shadow of that rock That from the son defends thy flock? Fain would I feed among thy sheep, Among them rest, among them sleep.  3 Why should thy bride appear like one That turns aside to paths unknown? My constant feet would never rove, Would never seek another love.  4 [The footsteps of thy flock I see; Thy sweetest pastures here they be; A wondrous feast thy love prepares, Bought with thy wounds, and groans, and tears.  5 His dearest flesh he makes my food, And bids me drink his richest blood; Here to these hills my soul will come, To my beloved lead me home.]   Hymn 1:68. The banquet of love, Cant. 2. 1 2 3 4 6 7.  1 Behold the Rose of Sharon here, The Lily which the vallies bear; Behold the Tree of Life, that gives Refreshing fruit and healing leaves.  2 Amongst the thorns so lilies shine, Amongst wild gourds the noble vine; So in mine eyes my Saviour proves Amidst a thousand meaner loves.  3 Beneath his cooling shade I sat To shield me from the burning heat; Of heavenly fruit he spreads a feast To feed my eyes and please my taste.  4 [Kindly he brought me to the place Where stands the banquet of his grace, He saw me faint, and o'er my head The banner of his love he spread.  5 With living bread and generous wine He cheers this sinking heart of mine; And opening his own heart to me, He shews his thoughts how kind they be.]  6 O never let my Lord depart, Lie down and rest upon my heart; I charge my sins not once to move Nor stir, nor wake, nor grieve my Love.   Hymn 1:69. Christ appearing to his church, and seeking her company, Cant. 2. 1-13.  1 The voice of my beloved sounds Over the rocks and rising grounds, O'er hills of guilt, and seas of grief, He leaps, he flies to my relief.  2 Now thro' the veil of flesh I see With eyes of love he looks at me; Now in the gospel's clearest glass He shews the beauties of his face.  3 Gently he draws my heart along Both with his beauties and his tongue; \"Rise,\" saith my Lord, \"make haste away; \"No mortal joys are worth thy stay.  4 \"The Jewish wintery state is gone, \"The mists are fled, the spring comes on, \"The sacred turtle-dove we hear \"Proclaim the new, the joyful year.  5 \"Th' immortal vine of heavenly root \"Blossoms and buds, and gives her fruit:\" Lo, we are come to taste the wine; Our souls rejoice and bless the vine.  6 And when we hear our Jesus say, \"Rise up, my love, make haste away!\" Our hearts would fain out-fly the wind, And leave all earthly loves behind.   Hymn 1:70. Christ inviting, and the church answering the invitation, Cant. 2. 14 16 17.  1 [Hark, the Redeemer from on high Sweetly invites his favourites nigh; From caves of darkness and of doubt, He gently speaks, and calls us out:  2 \"My dove, who hidest in the rock, \"Thine heart almost with sorrow broke, \"Lift up thy face, forget thy fear, \"And let thy voice delight mine ear.  3 \"Thy voice to me sounds ever sweet; \"My graces in thy countenance meet; \"Tho' the vain world thy face despise, \"'Tis bright and comely in mine eyes.\"  4 Dear Lord, our thankful heart receives The hope thine invitation gives: 'To thee our joyful lips shall raise The voice of prayer, and of praise.]  5 [I am my Love's, and he is mine; Our hearts, our hopes, our passions join: Nor let a motion, nor a word, Nor thought arise to grieve my Lord.  6 My soul to pastures fair he leads, Amongst the lilies where he feeds; Amongst the saints (whose robes are white, Wash'd in his blood) is his delight.  7 Till the day break, and shadows flee, Till the sweet dawning light I see, Thine eyes to me-ward often turn, Nor let my soul in darkness mourn.  8 Be like a hart on mountains green, Leap o'er the hills of fear and sin; Nor guilt, nor unbelief divide My Love, my Saviour from my side.]   Hymn 1:71. Christ found in the street, and brought to the church, Cant. 3. 1-5.  1 Often I seek my Lord by night, Jesus, my love, my soul's delight; With warm desire and restless thought I seek him oft, but find him not.  2 Then I arise, and search the street Till I my Lord, my Saviour meet; I ask the watchmen of the night, \"Where did you see my soul's delight?\"  3 Sometimes I find him in the way, Directed by a heavenly ray; I leap for joy to see his face, And hold him fast in mine embrace.  4 [I bring him to my mother's home, Nor does my Lord refuse to come, To Sion's sacred chambers, where My soul first drew the vital air.  5 He gives me there his bleeding heart, Pierc'd for my sake with deadly smart; I give my soul to him, and there Our loves their mutual tokens share.]  6 I charge you all, ye earthly toys, Approach not to disturb my joys; Nor sin, nor hell come near my heart, Nor cause my Saviour to depart.   Hymn 1:72. The coronation of Christ, and espousals of the church, Cant. 3. 2.  1 Daughters of Sion, come, behold The crown of honour and of gold, Which the glad church with joys unknown Plac'd on the head of Solomon.  2 Jesus, thou everlasting King, Accept the tribute which we bring, Accept the well-deserv'd renown, And wear our praises as thy crown.  3 Let every act of worship be Like our espousals, Lord, to thee; Like the dear hour, when from above We first receiv'd thy pledge of love.  4 The gladness of that happy day, Our hearts would wish it long to stay, Nor let our faith forsake its hold, Nor comfort sink, nor love grow cold.  5 Each following minute as it flies, Increase thy praise, improve our joys, Till we are rais'd to sing thy Name At the great supper of the Lamb.  6 O that the months would roll away, And bring that coronation-day! The King of Grace shall fill the throne With all his Father's glories on.   Hymn 1:73. The church's beauty in the eyes of Christ, Cant. 4. 1 10 11 7 9 8.  1 Kind is the speech of Christ our Lord, Affection sounds in every word, \"Lo, thou art fair, my love, he cries, \"Not the young doves have sweeter eyes.  2 [\"Sweet are thy lips, thy pleasing voice \"Salutes mine ear with secret joys, \"No spice so much delights the smell, \"Nor milk nor honey taste so well.]  3 \"Thou art all fair, my bride, to me, \"I will behold no spot in thee.\" What mighty wonders love performs, And puts a comeliness on worms!  4 Defil'd and loathsome as we are, He makes us white, and calls us fair; Adorns us with that heavenly dress, His graces and his righteousness.  5 \"My sister, and my spouse,\" he cries, \"Bound to my heart by various ties, \"Thy powerful love my heart detains \"In strong delight and pleasing chains.\"  6 He calls me from the leopard's den, From this wild world of beasts and men, To Sion where his glories are; Not Lebanon is half so fair.  7 Nor dens of prey, nor flowery plains Nor earthly joys, nor earthly pains Shall hold my feet, or force my stay, When Christ invites my soul away.   Hymn 1:74. The church the garden of Christ, Cant. 4. 12 14 15, and 5. 1.  1 We are a garden wall'd around, Chosen and made peculiar ground; A little spot inclos'd by grace, Out of the world's wide wilderness.  2 Like trees of myrrh and spice we stand, Planted by God the Father's hand; And all his springs in Sion flow To make the young plantation grow.  3 Awake, O heavenly wind, and come, Blow on this garden of perfume; Spirit divine, descend and breathe A gracious gale on plants beneath.  4 Make our best spices flow abroad To entertain our Saviour God: And faith, and love, and joy appear, And every grace be active here.  5 [Let my beloved come, and taste His pleasant fruits at his own feast: \"I come, my spouse, I come,\" he cries, With love and pleasure in his eyes.  6 Our Lord into his garden comes, Well pleas'd to smell our poor perfumes; And calls us to a feast divine, Sweeter than honey, milk, or wine.  7 \"Eat of the tree of life, my friends, \"The blessings that my Father sends; \"Your taste shall all my dainties prove, \"And drink abundance of my love.\"  8 Jesus, we will frequent thy board, And sing the bounties of our Lord: But the rich food on which we live Demands more praise than tongues can give.]   Hymn 1:75. The description of Christ the beloved, Cant. 5. 9-12 14 15 16.  1 The wondering world enquires to know Why I should love my Jesus so: \"What are his charms,\" say they, \"above \"The objects of a mortal love!\"  2 Yes, my beloved, to my sight, Shews a sweet mixture red and white: All human beauties, all divine, In my beloved meet and shine,  3 White is his soul, from blemish free; Red with the blood he shed for me; The fairest of ten thousand fairs: A sun amongst ten thousand stars.  4 [His head the finest gold excels, There wisdom in perfection dwells; And glory like a crown adorns Those temples once beset with thorns.  5 Compassions in his heart are found, Hard by the signals of his wound; His sacred side no more shall bear The cruel scourge, the piercing spear.]  6 [His hands are fairer to behold Than diamonds set in rings of gold; Those heavenly hands that on the tree Were nail'd, and torn, and bled for me.  7 Tho' once he bow'd his feeble knees, Loaded with sins and agonies, Now on the throne of his command His legs like marble pillars stand.]  8 [His eyes are majesty and love, The eagle temper'd with the dove: No more shall trickling sorrows roll Thro' those dear windows of his soul.  9 His mouth, that pour'd out long complaints, Now smiles, and cheers his fainting saints; His countenance more graceful is Than Lebanon with all its trees.]  10 All over glorious is my Lord, Must be belov'd, and yet ador'd: His worth if all the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],["title","Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#7)"],["body"," knew, Sure the whole earth would love him too.   Hymn 1:76. Christ dwells in heaven, but visits on earth, Cant. 6. 1 2 3 12.  1 When strangers stand and hear me tell What beauties in my Saviour dwell; Where he is gone, they fain would know, That they may seek and love him too.  2 My best beloved keeps his throne On hills of light in worlds unknown But he descends, and shews his face In the young gardens of his grace.  3 [In vineyards planted by his hand, Where fruitful trees in order stand; He feeds among the spicy beds, Where lilies shew their spotless heads.  4 He has engross'd my warmest love, No earthly charms my soul can move: I have a mansion in his heart, Nor death nor hell shall make us part.]  5 [He takes my soul ere I'm aware, And shews me where his glories are; No chariot of Amminadib The heavenly rapture can describe.  6 O may my spirit daily rise On wings of faith above the skies, Till death shall make my last remove To dwell for ever with my love.]   Hymn 1:77. The love of Christ to the church, in his language to her, and provisions for her, Cant. 7. 5 6 9 12 13.  1 Now in the galleries of his grace Appears the King, and thus he says, \"How fair my saints are in my sight; \"My love how pleasant for delight!\"  2 Kind is thy language, sovereign Lord, There's heavenly grace in every word: From that dear mouth a stream divine Flows sweeter than the choicest wine.  3 Such wondrous love awakes the lip Of saints that were almost asleep, To speak the praises of thy name, And makes our cold affections flame.  4 These are the joys he lets us know In fields and villages below, Gives us a relish of his love, But keeps his noblest feast above.  5 In Paradise within the gates An higher entertainment waits; Fruits new and old laid up in store, Where we shall feed, but thirst no more.   Hymn 1:78. The strength of Christ's love, and the soul's jealousy of her own, Cant. 8. 5 6 7 13 14.  1 [Who is this fair one in distress, That travels from the wilderness? And press'd with sorrows and with sins, On her beloved Lord she leans.  2 This is the spouse of Christ our God, Bought with the treasure of his blood; And her request and her complaint Is but the voice of every saint.]  3 \"O let my name engraven stand, \"Both on thy heart and on thy hand: \"Seal me upon thine arm; and wear \"That pledge of love for ever there.  4 \"Stronger than death thy love is known, \"Which floods of wrath could never drown; \"And hell and earth in vain combine \"To quench a fire so much divine.  5 \"But I am jealous of my heart, Lest it should once from thee depart; \"Then let thy name be well impress'd As a fair signet on my breast.  6 \"Till thou hast brought me to thy home, \"Where fears and doubts can never come, \"Thy count'nance let me often see, \"And often thou shalt hear from me.  7 \"Come, my beloved, haste away, \"Cut short the hours of thy delay, \"Fly like a youthful hart or roe \"Over the hills where spices grow.\"   Hymn 1:79. A morning hymn, Psalm 19. 5 8 and 73. 24 25.  1 God of the morning, at whose voice The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, And, like a giant doth rejoice To run his journey thro' the skies;  2 From the fair chambers of the east The circuit of his race begins, And without weariness or rest, Round the whole earth he flies and shines.  3 O like the sun may I fulfil Th' appointed duties of the day, With ready mind and active will March on and keep my heavenly way.  4 [But I shall rove and lose the race, If God my sun should disappear, And leave me in this world's wild maze, To follow every wandering star.  5 Lord, thy commands are clean and pure, Enlightening our beclouded eyes, Thy threatenings just, thy promise sure, Thy gospel makes the simple wise.]  6 Give me thy counsels for my guide, And then receive me to thy bliss; All my desires and hopes beside Are faint and cold compar'd to this.   Hymn 1:80. An evening hymn, Psalm 4. 8. and 3. 5 6. and 143. 8.  1 Thus far the Lord has led me on, Thus far his power prolongs my days, And every evening shall make known Some fresh memorial of his grace.  2 Much of my time has run to waste, And I perhaps am near my home; But he forgives my follies past, He gives me strength for days to come.  3 I lay my body down to sleep, Peace is the pillow for my head, While well-appointed angels keep Their watchful stations round my bed.  4 In vain the sons of earth or hell Tell me a thousand frightful things, My God in safety makes me dwell Beneath the shadow of his wings.  5 [Faith in his name forbids my fear: O may thy presence ne'er depart! And in the morning make me hear The love and kindness of thy heart.  6 Thus when the night of death shall come, My flesh shall rest beneath the ground, And wait thy voice to rouse my tomb, With sweet salvation in the sound.   Hymn 1:81. A song for morning or evening, Lam. 3. 23. Isa. 45. 7.  1 My God, how endless is thy love! Thy gifts are every evening new; And morning mercies from above Gently distil like early dew.  2 Thou spreadst the curtains of the night, Great guardian of my sleeping hours; Thy sovereign word restores the light, And quickens all my drowsy powers.  3 I yield my powers to thy command, To thee I consecrate my days; Perpetual blessings from thine hand Demand perpetual songs of praise.   Hymn 1:82. God far above creatures; or, Man vain and mortal, Job 4. 77-21.  1 Shall the vile race of flesh and blood Contend with their creator, God? Shall mortal worms presume to be More holy, wise, or just than he?  2 Behold he puts his trust in none Of all the spirits round his throne; Their natures, when compar'd with his Are neither holy, just nor wise.  3 But how much meaner things are they Who spring from dust and dwell in clay! Touch'd by the finger of thy wrath, We faint and vanish like the moth.  4 From night to day, from day to night, We die by thousands in thy sight; Bury'd in dust whole nations lie Like a forgotten vanity.  5 Almighty power, to thee we bow; How frail are we, how glorious thou! No more the sons of earth shall dare With an eternal God compare.   Hymn 1:83. Afflictions and death under providence, Job 5. 6 7 8.  1 Not from the dust affliction grows, Nor troubles rise by chance; Yet we are born to care and woes, A sad inheritance.  2 As sparks break out from burning coals, And still are upwards borne; So grief is rooted in our souls, And man grows up to mourn.  3 Yet with my God I leave my cause, And trust his promis'd grace; He rules me by his well-known laws Of love and righteousness.  4 Not all the pains that e'er I bore Shall spoil my future peace, For death and hell can do no more Than what my Father please.   Hymn 1:84. Salvation, righteousness, and strength in Christ, Isa. 45. 21 25.  1 Jehovah speaks, let Israel hear, Let all the earth rejoice and fear, While God's eternal Son proclaims His sovereign honours and his names:  2 \"I am the last, and I the first, \"The Saviour God, and God the just; \"There's none beside pretends to shew \"Such justice and salvation too.  3 \"[Ye that in shades of darkness dwell, \"Just on the verge of death and hell, \"Look up to me from distant lands, \"Light, life and heaven are in my hands.  4 \"I by my holy Name have sworn, \"Nor shall the word in vain return, \"To me shall all things bend the knee, \"And every tongue shall swear to me.]  5 \"In me alone shall men confess \"Lies all their strength and righteousness; \"But such as dare despise my Name, \"I'll clothe them with eternal shame.  6 \"In me the Lord, shall all the seed \"Of Israel from their sins be freed, \"And by their shining graces prove \"Their interest in my pardoning love.\"   Hymn 1:85. The same.  1 The Lord on high proclaims His Godhead from his throne; \"Mercy and justice are the names \"By which I will be known.  2 \"Ye dying souls that sit \"In darkness and distress, \"Look from the borders of the pit \"To my recovering grace.\"  3 Sinners shall hear the sound; Their thankful tongues shall own, \"Our righteousness and strength is found \"In thee, the Lord, alone.\"  4 In thee shall Israel trust, And see their guilt forgiven; God will pronounce the sinners just, And take the saints to heaven.   Hymn 1:86. God holy, just, and sovereign. Job 9. 2-10.  1 How should the sons of Adam's race Be pure before their God? If he contend in righteousness We fall beneath his rod.  2 To vindicate my words and thoughts I'll make no more pretence; Not one of all my thousand faults Can bear a just defence.  3 Strong is his arm, his heart is wise; What vain presumers dare Against their Maker's hand to rise, Or tempt th' unequal war?  4 [Mountains by his almighty wrath From their old seats are torn; He shakes the earth from south to north, And all her pillars mourn.  5 He bids the sun forbear to rise, Th' obedient sun forbears: His hand with sackcloth spreads the skies, And seals up all the stars.  6 He walks upon the stormy sea Flies on the stormy wind; There's none can trace his wondrous way, Or his dark footsteps find.]   Hymn 1:87. God dwells with the humble and penitent, Isa. 57. 15 16.  1 Thus saith the High and Lofty One, \"I sit upon my holy throne, \"My name is God, I dwell on high, \"Dwell in my own eternity.  2 \"But I descend to worlds below, \"On earth I have a mansion too, \"The humble spirit and contrite \"Is an abode of my delight.  3 \"The humble soul my words revive, \"I bid the mourning sinner live, \"Heal all the broken hearts I find, \"And ease the sorrows of the mind.  4 \"When I contend against their sin \"I make them know how vile they've been; \"But should my wrath for ever smoke, \"Their souls would sink beneath my stroke.\"]  5 O may thy pardoning grace be nigh, Lest we should faint, despair, and die! Thus shall our better thoughts approve The methods of thy chastening love.   Hymn 1:88. Life the day of grace and hope. Eccles. 9. 4 3 6 10.  1 Life is the time to serve the Lord, The time t' insure the great reward; And while the lamp holds out to burn The vilest sinner may return.  2 [Life is the hour that God has given To 'scape from hell, and fly to"]]]
