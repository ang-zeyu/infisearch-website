There can be no doubt that castrated men may still possess sexual impulses. This has been noted by observers in various countries in which eunuchs are made and employed.[9]      It is important to remember that there are different degrees of     castration, for in current language these are seldom     distinguished. The Romans recognized four different degrees: 1.     True _castrati_, from whom both the testicles and the penis had     been removed. 2. _Spadones_, from whom the testicles only had     been removed; this was the most common practice. 3. _Thlibiæ_, in     whom the testicles had not been removed, but destroyed by     crushing; this practice is referred to by Hippocrates. 4.     _Thlasiæ_, in whom the spermatic cord had simply been cut.     Millant, from whose Paris thesis (_Castration Criminelle et     Maniaque_, 1902) I take these definitions, points out that it was     recognized that _spadones_ remained apt for coitus if the     operation was performed after puberty, a fact appreciated by many     Roman ladies, _ad seouras libidinationes_, as St. Jerome     remarked, while Martial (lib. iv) said of a Roman lady who sought     eunuchs: \"Vult futui Gallia, non parere.\" (See also Millant, _Les     Eunuques à Travers les Ages_, 1909, and articles by Lipa Bey and     Zambaco, _Sexual-Probleme_, Oct. and Dec., 1911.)  In China, Matignon, formerly physician to the French legation in Pekin, tells us that eunuchs are by no means without sexual feeling, that they seek the company of women and, he believes, gratify their sexual desires by such methods as are left open to them, for the sexual organs are entirely removed. It would seem probable that, the earlier the age at which the operation is performed, the less marked are the sexual desires, for Matignon mentions that boys castrated before the age of 10 are regarded by the Chinese as peculiarly virginal and pure.[10] At Constantinople, where the eunuchs are of negro race, castration is usually complete and performed before puberty, in order to abolish sexual potency and desire as far as possible. Even when castration is effected in infancy, sexual desire is not necessarily rendered impossible. Thus Marie has recorded the case of an insane Egyptian eunuch whose penis and scrotum were removed in infancy; yet, he had frequent and intense sexual desire with ejaculation of mucus and believed that an invisible princess touched him and aroused voluptuous sensations. Although the body had a feminine appearance, the prostate was normal and the vesiculæ seminales not atrophied.[11] It may be added that Lancaster[12] quotes the following remark, made by a resident for many years in the land, concerning Nubian eunuchs: \"As far as I can judge, sex feeling exists unmodified by absence of the sexual organs. The eunuch differs from the man not in the absence of sexual passion, but only in the fact that he cannot fully gratify it. As far as he can approach a gratification of it he does so.\" In this connection it may be noted that (as quoted by Moll) Jäger attributes the preference of some women--noted in ancient Rome and in the East--for castrated men as due not only to the freedom from risk of impregnation in such intercourse, but also to the longer duration of erection in the castrated.  When castration is performed without removal of the penis it is said that potency remains for at least ten years afterward, and Disselhorst, who in his _Die accessorischen Geschlechtsdrüsen der Wirbelthiere_ takes the same view as has been here adopted, mentions that, according to Pelikan (_Das Skopzentum in Rüssland_), those castrated at puberty are fit for coitus long afterward. When castration is performed for surgical reasons at a later age it is still less likely to affect potency or to change the sexual feelings.[13] Guinard concludes that the sexual impulse after castration is relatively more persistent in man than in the lower animals, and is sometimes even heightened, being probably more dependent on external stimuli.[14]  Except in the East, castration is more often performed on women than on men, and then the evidence as to the influence of the removal of the ovaries on the sexual emotions shows varying results. It has been found that after castration sexual desire and sexual pleasure in coitus may either remain the same, be diminished or extinguished, or be increased. By some the diminution has been attributed to autosuggestion, the woman being convinced that she can no longer be like other women; the augmentation of desire and pleasure has been supposed to be due to the removal of the dread of impregnation. We have, of course, to take into account individual peculiarities, method of life, and the state of the health.      In France Jayle (\"Effets physiologiques de la Castration chez la     Femme,\" _Revue de Gynécologie_, 1897, pp. 403-57) found that,     among 33 patients in whom ovariotomy had been performed, in 18     sexual desire remained the same, in 3 it was diminished, in 8     abolished, in 3 increased; while pleasure in coitus remained the     same in 17, was diminished in 1, abolished in 4, and increased in     5, in 6 cases sexual intercourse was very painful. In two other     groups of cases--one in which both ovaries and uterus were     removed and another in which the uterus alone was removed--the     results were not notably different.      In Germany Gläveke (_Archiv für Gynäkologie_, Bd. xxxv, 1889)     found that desire remained in 6 cases, was diminished in 10, and     disappeared in 11, while pleasure in intercourse remained in 8,     was diminished in 10, and was lost in 8. Pfister, again (_Archiv     für Gynäkologie_, Bd. lvi, 1898), examined this point in 99     castrated women; he remarks that sexual desire and sexual     pleasure in intercourse were usually associated, and found the     former unchanged in 19 cases, decreased in 24, lost in 35, never     present in 21, while the latter was unchanged in 18 cases and     diminished or lost in 60. Keppler (International Medical     Congress, Berlin, 1890) found that among 46 castrated women     sexual feeling was in no case abolished. Adler also, who     discusses this question (_Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung     des Weibes_, 1904, p. 75 et seq.), criticises Gläveke's     statements and concludes that there is no strict relation between     the sexual organs and the sexual feelings. Kisch, who has known     several cases in which the feelings remained the same as before     the operation, brings together (_The Sexual Life of Women_)     varying opinions of numerous authors regarding the effects of     removal of the ovaries on the sexual appetite.      In America Bloom (as quoted in _Medical Standard_, 1896, p. 121)     found that in none of the cases of women investigated, in which     oöphorectomy had been performed before the age of 33, was the     sexual appetite entirely lost; in most of them it had not     materially diminished and in a few it was intensified. There     was, however, a general consensus of opinion that the normal     vaginal secretion during coitus was greatly lessened. In the     cases of women over 33, including also hysterectomies, a gradual     lessening of sexual feeling and desire was found to occur most     generally. Dr. Isabel Davenport records 2 cases (reported in     _Medical Standard_, 1895, p. 346) of women between 30 and 35     years of age whose erotic tendencies were extreme; the ovaries     and tubes were removed, in one case for disease, in the other     with a view of removing the sexual tendencies; in neither case     was there any change. Lapthorn Smith (_Medical Record_, vol.     xlviii) has reported the case of an unmarried woman of 24 whose     ovaries and tubes had been removed seven years previously for     pain and enlargement, and the periods had disappeared for six     years; she had had experience of sexual intercourse, and declared     that she had never felt such extreme sexual excitement and     pleasure as during coitus at the end of this time.      In England Lawson Tait and Bantock (_British Medical Journal_,     October 14, 1899, p. 975) have noted that sexual passion seems     sometimes to be increased even after the removal of ovaries,     tubes, and uterus. Lawson Tait also stated (_British     Gynæcological Journal_, Feb., 1887, p. 534) that after systematic     and extensive inquiry he had not found a single instance in     which, provided that sexual appetite existed before the removal     of the appendages, it was abolished by that operation. A Medical     Inquiry Committee appointed by the Liverpool Medical Institute     (ibid., p. 617) had previously reported that a considerable     number of patients stated that they had suffered a distinct loss     of sexual feeling. Lawson Tait, however, throws doubts on the     reliability of the Committee's results, which were based on the     statements of unintelligent hospital patients.      I may quote the following remarks from a communication sent to me     by an experienced physician in Australia: \"No rule can be laid     down in cases in which both ovaries have been extirpated. Some     women say that, though formerly passionate, they have since     become quite indifferent, but I am of opinion that the majority     of women who have had prior sexual experience retain desire and     gratification in an equal degree to that they had before     operation. I know one case in which a young girl hardly 19 years     old, who had been accustomed to congress for some twelve months,     had trouble which necessitated the removal of the ovaries and     tubes on both sides. Far from losing all her desire or     gratification, both were very materially increased in intensity.     Menstruation has entirely ceased, without loss of femininity in     either disposition or appearance. During intercourse, I am told,     there is continuous spasmodic contraction of various "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#4)"],["body","of the     vagina and vulva.\"  The independence of the sexual impulse from the distention of the sexual glands is further indicated by the great frequency with which sexual sensations, in a faint or even strong degree, are experienced in childhood and sometimes in infancy, and by the fact that they often persist in women long after the sexual glands have ceased their functions.      In the study of auto-erotism in another volume of these _Studies_     I have brought together some of the evidence showing that even in     very young children spontaneous self-induced sexual excitement,     with orgasm, may occur. Indeed, from an early age sexual     differences pervade the whole nervous tissue. I may here quote     the remarks of an experienced gynecologist: \"I venture to think,\"     Braxton Hicks said many years ago, \"that those who have much     attended to children will agree with me in saying that, almost     from the cradle, a difference can be seen in manner, habits of     mind, and in illness, requiring variations in their treatment.     The change is certainly hastened and intensified at the time of     puberty; but there is, even to an average observer, a clear     difference between the sexes from early infancy, gradually     becoming more marked up to puberty. That sexual feelings exist     [it would be better to say 'may exist'] from earliest infancy is     well known, and therefore this function does not depend upon     puberty, though intensified by it. Hence, may we not conclude     that the progress toward development is not so abrupt as has been     generally supposed?... The changes of puberty are all of them     dependent on the primordial force which, gradually gathering in     power, culminates in the perfection both of form and of the     sexual system, primary and secondary.\"      There appear to have been but few systematic observations on the     persistence of the sexual impulse in women after the menopause.     It is regarded as a fairly frequent phenomenon by Kisch, and also     by Löwenfeld (_Sexualleben und Nervenleiden_, p. 29). In America,     Bloom (as quoted in _Medical Standard_, 1896), from an     investigation of four hundred cases, found that in some cases the     sexual impulse persisted to a very advanced age, and mentions a     case of a woman of 70, twenty years past the menopause, who had     been long a widow, but had recently married, and who declared     that both desire and gratification were as great, if not greater,     than before the menopause.  Reference may finally be made to those cases in which the sexual impulse has developed notwithstanding the absence, verified or probable, of any sexual glands at all. In such cases sexual desire and sexual gratification are sometimes even stronger than normal. Colman has reported a case in which neither ovaries nor uterus could be detected, and the vagina was too small for coitus, but pleasurable intercourse took place by the rectum and sexual desire was at times so strong as to amount almost to nymphomania. Clara Barrus has reported the case of a woman in whom there was congenital absence of uterus and ovaries, as proved subsequently by autopsy, but the sexual impulse was very strong and she had had illicit intercourse with a lover. She suffered from recurrent mania, and then masturbated shamelessly; when sane she was attractively feminine. Macnaughton-Jones describes the case of a woman of 32 with normal sexual feelings and fully developed breasts, clitoris, and labia, but no vagina or internal genitalia could be detected even under the most thorough examination. In a case of Bridgman's, again, the womb and ovaries were absent, and the vagina small, but coitus was not painful, and the voluptuous sensations were complete and sexual passion was strong. In a case of Cotterill's, the ovaries and uterus were of minute size and functionless, and the vagina was absent, but the sexual feelings were normal, and the clitoris preserved its usual sensibility. Mundé had recorded two similar cases, of which he presents photographs. In all these cases not only was the sexual impulse present in full degree, but the subjects were feminine in disposition and of normal womanly conformation; in most cases the external sexual organs were properly developed.[15]      Féré (_L'Instinct sexuel_, p. 241) has sought to explain away     some of these phenomena, in so far as they may be brought against     the theory that the secretions and excretions of the sexual     glands are the sole source of the sexual impulse. The persistence     of sexual feelings after castration may be due, he argues, to the     presence of the nerves in the cicatrices, just as the amputated     have the illusion that the missing limb is still there. Exactly     the same explanation has since been put forward by Moll,     _Medizinische Klinik_, 1905, Nrs. 12 and 13. In the same way the     presence of sexual feelings after the menopause may be due to     similar irritation determined by degeneration during involution     of the glands. The precocious appearance of the sexual impulse in     childhood he would explain as due to an anomaly of development in     the sexual organs. Féré makes no attempt to explain the presence     of the sexual impulse in the congenital absence of the sexual     glands; here, however, Mundé intervenes with the suggestion that     it is possible that in most cases \"an infinitesimal trace of     ovary\" may exist, and preserve femininity, though insufficient to     produce ovulation or menstruation.      It is proper to mention these ingenious arguments. They are,     however, purely hypothetical, obviously invented to support a     theory. It can scarcely be said that they carry conviction. We     may rather agree with Guinard that so great is the importance of     reproduction that nature has multiplied the means by which     preparation is made for the conjunction of the sexes and the     roads by which sexual excitation may arrive. As Hirschfeld puts     it, in a discussion of this subject (_Sexual-Probleme_, Feb.,     1912), \"Nature has several irons in the fire.\"      It will be seen that the conclusions we have reached indirectly     involve the assumption that the spinal nervous centers, through     which the sexual mechanism operates, are not sufficient to     account for the whole of the phenomena of the sexual impulse. The     nervous circuit tends to involve a cerebral element, which may     sometimes be of dominant importance. Various investigators, from     the time of Gall onward, have attempted to localize the sexual     instinct centrally. Such attempts, however, cannot be said to     have succeeded, although they tend to show that there is a real     connection between the brain and the generative organs. Thus     Ceni, of Modena, by experiments on chickens, claims to have     proved the influence of the cortical centers of procreation on     the faculty of generation, for he found that lesions of the     cortex led to sterility corresponding in degree to the lesion;     but as these results followed even independently of any     disturbance of the sexual instinct, their significance is not     altogether clear (Carlo Ceni, \"L'Influenza dei Centri Corticali     sui Fenomeni della Generazione,\" _Revista Sperimentale di     Freniatria_, 1907, fasc. 2-3). At present, as Obici and     Marchesini have well remarked, all that we can do is to assume     the existence of cerebral as well as spinal sexual centers; a     cerebral sexual center, in the strictest sense, remains purely     hypothetical.      Although Gall's attempt to locate the sexual instinct in the     cerebellum--well supported as it was by observations--is no     longer considered to be tenable, his discussion of the sexual     instinct was of great value, far in advance of his time, and     accompanied by a mass of facts gathered from many fields. He     maintained that the sexual instinct is a function of the brain,     not of the sexual organs. He combated the view ruling in his day     that the seat of erotic mania must be sought in the sexual     organs. He fully dealt with the development of the sexual     instinct in many children before maturity of the sexual glands,     the prolongation of the instinct into old age, its existence in     the castrated and in the congenital absence of the sexual glands;     he pointed out that even with an apparently sound and normal     sexual apparatus all sorts of psychic pathological deviations may     yet occur. In fact, all the lines of argument I have briefly     indicated in the foregoing pages--although when they were first     written this fact was unknown to me--had been fully discussed by     this remarkable man nearly a century ago. (The greater part of     the third volume of Gall's _Sur les Fonctions du Cerveau_, in the     edition of 1825, is devoted to this subject. For a good summary,     sympathetic, though critical, of Gall's views on this matter, see     Möbius, \"Ueber Gall's Specielle Organologie,\" _Schmidt's     Jahrbücher der Medicin_, 1900, vol. cclxvii; also _Ausgewahlte     Werke_, vol. vii.)  It will be seen that the question of the nature of the sexual impulse has been slowly transformed. It is no longer a question of the formation of semen in the male, of the function of menstruation in the female. It has become largely a question of physiological chemistry. The chief parts in the drama of sex, alike on its psychic as on its physical sides, are thus supposed to be played by two mysterious protagonists, the hormones, or internal secretions, of the testes and of the ovary. Even the part played by the brain is now often regarded as chemical, the brain being considered to be a great chemical laboratory. There is a tendency, moreover, to extend the sexual sphere so as to admit the influence of internal secretions from other glands. The thymus, the adrenals, the thyroid, the pituitary, even the"]]]
