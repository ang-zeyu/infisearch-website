And in that chamber was a chimney to the fire, so that the hearth was against the wall, which was a marvel to many, but made the place more meet for the king. Ingild the merchant, my other godfather, whose home was in London, had brought men thence to make it for us, having the like in his own house after some foreign pattern.  There were two men only in this room when I returned ready for the feast. Both stood before the fire, and both were brightly dressed, and hardly, but for the drowsy hawk which sat unhooded on his hand, should I have known Lodbrok in the rich dress my father had had prepared for him. The other was Beorn, the king's falconer, who went everywhere with his master. These two were speaking together as they stood before the fire, and I thought that what Beorn said was not pleasing to the Dane, for he turned away a little, and answered shortly.  When they saw me both turned, Lodbrok with a smile of welcome, and Beorn with a loud, rough voice crying to me:  \"Ho, Wulfric, here is a strange thing! This gold ring have I offered to your stranger here for his falcon--which has three wing feathers missing, moreover--and he will not sell, though I trow that a man cast ashore must needs want gold more than a bird which he may not fly save I gain him leave from the king.\"  \"The bird is Wulfric's,\" said Lodbrok quietly.  \"Nay, Jarl,\" I answered, \"I would not take so loving a hawk from her master, and over all our manors you may surely fly her.\"  \"See you there!\" cried Beorn, with a sort of delight, not heeding my last words, \"Wulfric will not have her! Now will you sell?\"  Then Lodbrok looked at me with a short glance that I could not but understand, and said that it would surely grieve him if I would not take the falcon.  Pleased enough I was, though half unwilling to take what seemed as a forced gift. Yet to quiet Beorn--whom I never liked, as he was both overbearing and boastful, though of great skill in his art of falconry--I thanked the Dane, and went to where a hawking glove hung on the wall, for my arm would feel the marks of those strong talons for many a day, already. As I put it on I said that I feared the bird would hardly come to me, leaving her master.  \"Once I would have said that she would not,\" said Lodbrok; \"for until today she would bide with no man but myself and her keeper. But today she has sat on your wrist, so that I know she will love you well, for reasons that are beyond my guessing.\"  And so he shifted the falcon lightly from his wrist to mine, and there she sat quietly, looking from him to me as though she would own us both.  Then said Beorn, holding out his hand, on which he wore his embroidered state glove of office:  \"This is foolishness. The bird will perch on any wrist that is rightly held out to her, so she be properly called,\" and he whistled shrill, trying to edge the falcon from my hand.  In a moment she roused herself, and her great wings flew out, striking his arm and face as he pushed them forward; and had he not drawn back swiftly, her iron beak would surely have rent his gay green coat.  \"Plague on the kite!\" he said; \"surely she is bewitched! And if her master is, as they say, a wizard, that is likely--\"  \"Enough, Master Falconer,\" I said, growing angry. \"Lodbrok is our guest, and this, moreover, is the court for the time. Why, the bird is drowsy, and has been with me already. There is no wonder in the matter, surely?\"  But Beorn scowled, and one might see that his pride of falconry was hurt. Maybe he would have answered again, but I spoke to Lodbrok, asking him what the falcon was, as she was like none of ours, for this was a thing I knew Beorn would be glad to know, while his pride would not let him ask.  And Lodbrok answered that she was an Iceland gerfalcon from the far northern ocean, and went on to tell us of her powers of flight, and at what game she was best, and how she would take her quarry, and the like. And Beorn sat down and feigned to pay no heed to us.  Presently the Dane said that he had known gerfalcons to fly from Iceland to Norway in a day, and at that Beorn laughed as in scorn.  \"Who shouted from Norway to Iceland to say that a lost hawk had come over?\" he said.  The Dane laughed a little also, as at a jest; though one could tell that Beorn rather meant insult.  \"Why,\" he answered, \"the bird got loose from her master's ship as he sailed out of port in Iceland, and he found her at home in Nidaros at his journey's ending; and they knew well on what day she came, which was the same as that on which she got free.\"  Then I said, lest Beorn should scoff again:  \"Now, if this falcon got free from here, surely she will go home to your land.\"  \"Aye, and so my sons will think me dead, seeing her come without me. Wherefore keep her safely mewed until she has learnt that this is her home, for I would not have that mischance happen.\"  That I promised easily, for I prized the bird highly. And that I might not leave him with the surly Beorn, I asked the jarl to come and see her safely bestowed, and left the room with him.  As we crossed the courtyard to the mews, where our good hawks were, Lodbrok said to me:  \"I fear yon falconer is ill pleased with me.\"  \"I have a mind to tell the king of his rudeness to our guest,\" I answered.  \"That is not worth while,\" said Lodbrok. \"The man's pride is hurt that he should be thus baffled for all his skill, which, from his talk, must be great,\" and we both laughed, for Beorn loved his own praises.  Now when we got back the guests were gathering, and it was not long before the king entered, and at once called me.  \"All here I know but one, Wulfric, and that one is your seafarer. Let me know him also that speech may be free among us.\"  So Lodbrok came, and he and the king looked long at one another before Eadmund spoke.  \"I have heard your story, friend, and it is a strange one,\" he said pleasantly. \"Moreover, I know your name in some way.\"  \"Well known is the name of Ragnar Lodbrok, my forefather,\" said the jarl. \"Mayhap the king remembers the name thus!\"  \"Aye,\" answered Eadmund, \"that is a well-known and honoured name, and I think that Ragnar's son has a share in his courage. But your face also seems known to me, and it was not of the great Ragnar that I thought. Have we met in years past?\"  Then Lodbrok said that he had been in London at a time when Offa the King was there, and it was long years ago, but that the very day might be remembered by reason of a great wedding that he had been to see out of curiosity, knowing little of Saxon customs. And he named the people who were married in the presence of Offa and many nobles.  Then Eadmund laughed a little.  \"Now it all comes into my mind,\" he said; \"you are the leader of those strangers who must needs come into the church in helm and mail, with axe and shield hung on shoulders. Moreover, for that reason, when men bade you depart and you went not, they even let you bide. So I asked your name--and now I can answer for it that Lodbrok Jarl you are.\"  And he held out his hand for the Dane to kiss, after our custom. But Lodbrok grasped and shook it heartily, saying:  \"Thanks, Lord King, for that remembrance, and maybe also for a little forgetfulness.\"  Nor was Eadmund displeased with the freedom, but at that last saying he laughed outright.  \"Kings have both to remember and forget,\" he said, \"and maybe, if the citizens had not expected you to behave as wild vikings, you would have gone peacefully as you came?\"  \"That is the truth,\" said Lodbrok.  So I suppose there had been some fray, of little moment, with the London folk.  Then we followed the king into the hall; and Lodbrok and I together sat at table over against him. Soon I knew all that an hour or two of pleasant talk would teach me of his home and sons and sports, and the king asked now and again of Danish customs, not yet speaking of the voyage.  \"For,\" said he, \"it is ill recalling hardships until the feast is over. Then may one enjoy the telling.\"  Presently the gleemen sang to us; and after that the harp went round, that those who could might sing, and all the talk in hall was hushed to hear Eadmund himself, the men setting down ale cups and knives to listen, for he had a wondrously sweet voice, and sang from the ancient songs of Caedmon {iv}. Then I sang of the sea--some song I had made and was proud of, and it pleased all. And at length we looked at Lodbrok, wondering if he could take his turn.  \"Fain would I try to please my host,\" he said, looking a little wistfully at my father; \"but a man swept far from home against his will is no singer.\"  Then Eadmund pitied him, as did we all, and rose up.  \"Feasting is over, thanes,\" he said. \"Let us sit awhile in the other chamber and hear Lodbrok's story.\"  For he would ever leave the hall as at this time, so that the housecarles and lesser guests might have greater freedom of talk when we were gone.  So we rose up, and as we did so I saw Beorn, the falconer, look sourly at Lodbrok; and it misliked me that he should harbour any ill will even yet against the Dane who had done him no wrong.  Round the fire we sat; some ten of us in all, for Bishop Humbert and his folk went to their lodgings in the town, and there Lodbrok told the king of his voyage.  And when he named his sons, Eadmund looked grave, and said:  \"I have heard of those two chiefs, Ingvar and Hubba. Did they not make a raid into Northumbria two years ago? Maybe they are yet there with the host.\"  \"Aye,\" answered Lodbrok, seeming to wonder at the grave face of our king; \"they went to Northumbria with the host that is yet there. They fought well and bravely at the place men call Streoneshalch {v}, gaining much booty. And it was by Ingvar's plan that the place "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13752"],["title","Wulfric the Weapon Thane: A Story of the Danish Conquest of East Anglia (#5)"],["body","taken, and that was well done. But they left the host with their men after that, saying that there were over many leaders already.\"  Now we all knew the cruel story of the burning of that place; but Northumbria was a far-off kingdom, and with it we had naught to do. So, except perhaps the king, the rest of us were as little moved as if he had spoken of the taking of some Frankish town; for if my father thought more of it, being in the king's counsels, he passed it over.  \"These sons of yours have a mind to be first then,\" he said lightly.  \"Seeing that the blood of Ragnar Lodbrok is in their veins it could not well be otherwise,\" answered the jarl somewhat grimly.  Then he ended his tale, and the king was greatly pleased with him, so that he bade him bide in the court for a while that he might take back a good report of us to his own people.  Now when the king was with us, I gladly took up my duties as his armour bearer for the time; and therefore slept across the doorway of his chamber when he went to rest. So my father bestowed Lodbrok with the thanes in the great hall, and I left him there, following the king.  Well did I sleep that night, though, sailorwise, not so heavily but that any noise would rouse me in a moment. And as it drew towards morning the king stirred uneasily, and I looked up at him. Seeing that I woke he called me softly. The gray light of dawn came through the window, and I could see that he sat up in his bed, though I might not make out his face.  \"I am here, Lord King. Is aught amiss?\" I said, rising up with my sword in my hand.  \"Strange dreams have I had, my son,\" he said, in his quiet voice, \"and they trouble me.\"  \"Let me know them, my master,\" I said, \"and maybe the trouble will pass; for often that which seems sorely troublous in a dream is naught when one would put it into words.\"  \"Sit on the bed and I will tell you,\" he answered; and when I was there close to him he went on:  \"It was this: I thought that I was in some place where water gleamed beneath me, while overhead passed the tread of many feet with music of pipe and tabor as at a bridal. And I cannot tell what that place was. Then came to me the hand of this Lodbrok, and he, looking very sad and downcast, led me thence into the forest land and set me over against a great gate. And beyond that gate shone glorious light, and I heard the sound of voices singing in such wise that I knew it was naught but the gate of Heaven itself, and I would fain go therein. But between me and the gate sped arrows thick as hail, so that to reach it I must needs pass through them. Then said Jarl Lodbrok, 'Here is the entry, and it is so hard to win through because of me, yet not by my fault. But I think you will not turn aside for arrows, and when you come therein I pray you to remember me.' Then pressed I to the gate, unheeding of the arrow storm. And lo! the gate was an oak tree, tall and strong, yet beyond it was the light and the singing that I had reached. Then faded the face of Lodbrok, and after me looked sadly many faces, and one was yours, my son, and the nearest. So I woke.\"  \"That is a wondrous dream,\" I said, not knowing what to make thereof, having no skill in reading these matters.  \"Aye, my son,\" answered Eadmund; \"nor can I read it; though I think I shall do so hereafter. Nevertheless it comes into my mind that the dream warns me that my time is short. Lie down again, my son. Let us sleep in peace while we may.\"  After that the king slept peacefully as a little child till full daylight came; but I for very sadness closed not my eyes again, for I thought that our king was fey {vi}.  But in the morning the dream had, as it seemed, passed from the mind of Eadmund, for he was very cheerful, as was his wont, and said naught of it. However, I told my father thereof, for the remembrance was heavy to me. And he, when he heard it, bit his lip a little, pondering, but at last laughed.  \"Trouble not yourself about it, son Wulfric,\" he said; \"were I to mind every dream that I have had, I think that I should take no joy in life. Why, every year, for the last five past, I have dreamed of sore shipwreck, and the old vessel's timbers are yet hanging together!\"  I laughed also, and thought that maybe he was right--for my father's judgment was ever the best in my eyes--and so set my mind at rest, though the strangeness of the matter would not let it be altogether forgotten.  Now as days went on and we saw more of our guest, Lodbrok, there was, I think, no man of our household who would willingly have seen him take ship and leave us; for his ways and words were pleasant to all alike, and there seemed to be no craft of which he knew not something, so that he could speak to each man, in field or village or boat, of the things that he knew best. And that is a gift that may well be longed for by any man who would be loved by others.  Greatly pleased with him was Eadmund the King, so that he would talk long with him of the ways and laws and peoples beyond the seas; and also of hunting and hawking, which they both loved well. And in this last Lodbrok was the best skilled master I have ever known; and the king would ever have him ride beside him in the field while the court was yet with us. And that pleased not Beorn, though he kept his ill will to himself; and maybe I alone noted it, for I had not spoken of that meeting, of which I have told, even to my father.  Well, too, did my mother and Eadgyth like the courtly ways of the jarl, who was ever ready to tell them of the life in his household, and of the daughter, Osritha, who was its mistress since her mother died but a few years since, and her two elder sisters had been married to chiefs of their own land. Sometimes, too, they would ask him of the dress of the ladies of his land; but at that he would laugh and shake his head, saying that he only knew that they went wondrously clad, but that he could tell naught more of the matter.  \"Weapons and war gear I may talk of by the hour,\" he said, \"but women's gear is beyond me. But once my daughter and I wrought together in a matter that was partly of both, and that was when I needed a war flag. And so I drew out the great raven I would have embroidered on it, and they worked it in wondrous colours, and gold and silver round the form of the great bird, so that it seems to shift and flap its wings as the light falls on it and the breeze stirs it, as if there were magic therein.\"  Now Eadgyth was well skilled in this work, and thereat she must needs say that she would work me a flag for our ship, if the jarl would plan one. So it seems to me now that that evening was very pleasant, for they planned and shaped and began a flag whereon was drawn by the jarl a white falcon like the one he had given to me, and that was my thought, and it pleased him, as I think.  One day we came home early from our hunting, and Lodbrok and I sat in the great hall, while the summer rain swelled in torrents, with thunder and lightning sweeping over the river marshes and out to sea, and we looked at the weapons that hung on the walls.  \"Little care I for your long spear and short sword, friend Wulfric,\" he said; \"it seems to me that you must needs shorten the one and lengthen the other before you can be held well armed. And your bow is weak, and you have no axe.\"  For I had asked him what he thought of our Saxon weapons, else would he not have spoken so plainly. Then he thought for a little while, and said:  \"Would you learn to use the axe?\"  I answered that nothing would please me better; for of all things, I longed to excel in weapon play of all kinds.  \"That is well,\" he said, \"for I owe you my life, and I think that I can teach you that which will keep yours against any foe that you may meet; for you are of the right build for a good axeman, and not too old to learn.\"  Then we went to the smithy, and there, while the thunder raged outside, he forged me an axe of the Danish pattern.  \"Thor's own weather!\" he said, laughing; and as he spoke the blue lightning paled the red glow of the forge to a glimmer. \"This should be a good axe, and were you not a Christian, I would bid you hold your beginning, as its wielder, of good omen.\"  Then the thunder crashed, and there was no need for me to answer. And in the end he taught me patiently, until, one day, he said:  \"Now do you teach me to use your long spear. I can teach you no more axe play than you know. Some day you will meet an axeman face to face, and will find out what you know. Then, if I have taught you ill, say naught; but if well, then say 'Jarl Lodbrok taught me'.\"  Now I hold that the test of mastery of a weapon is that one wishes for no other, and I knew that I had learned that much. But I could not tell how much he had taught me, for axe play was new to me, and I had not seen it before.  After I had learned well, as he said, the jarl tempered the axe head, heating and cooling it many times, until it would take an edge that would shear through iron without turning. And he also wrought runes on it, hammering gold wire into clefts that he made.  \"What say they?\" I asked.  \"Thus they read,\" he answered:  \"Life for life. For Wulfric, Elfric's son, Lodbrok the seafarer, made me!\"  Thereat I wondered a little, for I knew not yet what he had taught me. Yet when I asked why he wrote those first words, he only laughed, saying, \"That you will know some day, as I think.\"  Now if I were to write all that went on until August came, I should speak of little but how the jarl and I were never apart; for though he was so much older than myself, I grew to be his fast friend. And many a long day did I spend with him in his boat, learning somewhat of his skill in handling her, both on river, and broad, and sea. Very pleasant those days were, and they went all too soon.  No ship came in that could help him homewards, and though the Danish host was in Northumbria, he cared not to go there, for his sons were gone home. And Eadmund would fain "]]]
