But King Sigmund's earl on the morrow hath joyful yea-saying,   And ere two moons be perished he shall fetch his bride away.   \"And bid him,\" King Eylimi sayeth, \"to come with no small array,   But with sword and shield and war-shaft, lest aught of ill betide.\"    So forth goes the earl of Sigmund across the sea-flood wide,   And comes to the land of the Volsungs, and meeteth Sigmund the king,   And tells how he sped on his errand, and the joyful yea-saying.   So King Sigmund maketh him ready, and they ride adown to the sea   All glorious of gear and raiment, and a goodly company.   Yet hath Sigmund thought of his father, and the deed he wrought before,   And hath scorn to gather his people and all his hosts of war   To wend to the feast and the wedding: yet are their long-ships ten,   And the shielded folk aboard them are the mightiest men of men.   So Sigmund goeth a shipboard, and they hoist their sails to the wind,   And the beaks of the golden dragons leave the Volsungs' land behind.   Then come they to Eylimi's kingdom, and good welcome have they there,   And when Sigmund looked on Hiordis, he deemed her wise and fair.   But her heart was exceeding fain when she saw the glorious king,   And it told her of times that should be full many a noble thing.    So there is Sigmund wedded at a great and goodly feast,   And day by day on Hiordis the joy of her heart increased;   And her father joyed in Sigmund and his might and majesty,   And dead in the heart of the Isle-king his ancient fear did lie.    Yet, forsooth, had men looked seaward, they had seen the gathering cloud,   And the little wind arising, that should one day pipe so loud.   For well may ye wot indeed that King Lyngi the Mighty is wroth,   When he getteth the gifts and the answer, and that tale of the woman's        troth:   And he saith he will have the gifts and the woman herself withal,   Either for loving or hating, and that both those heads shall fall.   So now when Sigmund and Hiordis are wedded a month or more,   And the Volsung bids men dight them to cross the sea-flood o'er,   Lo, how there cometh the tidings of measureless mighty hosts   Who are gotten ashore from their long-ships on the skirts of King Eylimi's        coasts.    Sore boded the heart of the Isle-king of what the end should be.   But Sigmund long beheld him, and he said: \"Thou deem'st of me   That my coming hath brought thee evil; but put aside such things;   For long have I lived, and I know it, that the lives of mighty kings   Are not cast away, nor drifted like the down before the wind;   And surely I know, who say it, that never would Hiordis' mind   Have been turned to wed King Lyngi or aught but the Volsung seed.   Come, go we forth to the battle, that shall be the latest deed   Of thee and me meseemeth: yea, whether thou live or die,   No more shall the brand of Odin at peace in his scabbard lie.\"    And therewith he brake the peace-strings and drew the blade of bale,   And Death on the point abided, Fear sat on the edges pale.    So men ride adown to the sea-strand, and the kings their hosts array   When the high noon flooded heaven; and the men of the Volsungs lay,   With King Eylimi's shielded champions mid Lyngi's hosts of war,   As the brown pips lie in the apple when ye cut it through the core.    But now when the kings were departed, from the King's house Hiordis went,   And before men joined the battle she came to a woody bent,   Where she lay with one of her maidens the death and the deeds to behold.    In the noon sun shone King Sigmund as an image all of gold,   And he stood before the foremost and the banner of his fame,   And many a thing he remembered, and he called on each earl by his name   To do well for the house of the Volsungs, and the ages yet unborn.   Then he tossed up the sword of the Branstock, and blew on his father's horn,   Dread of so many a battle, doom-song of so many a man.   Then all the earth seemed moving as the hosts of Lyngi ran   On the Volsung men and the Isle-folk like wolves upon the prey;   But sore was their labour and toil ere the end of their harvesting day.    On went the Volsung banners, and on went Sigmund before,   And his sword was the flail of the tiller on the wheat of the        wheat-thrashing floor,   And his shield was rent from his arm, and his helm was sheared from his        head:   But who may draw nigh him to smite for the heap and the rampart of dead?   White went his hair on the wind like the ragged drift of the cloud,   And his dust-driven, blood-beaten harness was the death-storm's angry        shroud,   When the summer sun is departing in the first of the night of wrack;   And his sword was the cleaving lightning, that smites and is hurried aback   Ere the hand may rise against it; and his voice was the following thunder.    Then cold grew the battle before him, dead-chilled with the fear and the        wonder:   For again in his ancient eyes the light of victory gleamed;   From his mouth grown tuneful and sweet the song of his kindred streamed;   And no more was he worn and weary, and no more his life seemed spent:   And with all the hope of his childhood was his wrath of battle blent;   And he thought: A little further, and the river of strife is passed,   And I shall sit triumphant the king of the world at last.    But lo, through the hedge of the war-shafts a mighty man there came,   One-eyed and seeming ancient, but his visage shone like flame:   Gleaming-grey was his kirtle, and his hood was cloudy blue;   And he bore a mighty twi-bill, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,   And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite.   Once more round the head of the Volsung fierce glittered the Branstock's        light,   The sword that came from Odin; and Sigmund's cry once more   Rang out to the very heavens above the din of war.   Then clashed the meeting edges with Sigmund's latest stroke,   And in shivering shards fell earthward that fear of worldly folk.   But changed were the eyes of Sigmund, and the war-wrath left his face;   For that grey-clad mighty helper was gone, and in his place   Drave on the unbroken spear-wood 'gainst the Volsung's empty hands:   And there they smote down Sigmund, the wonder of all lands,   On the foemen, on the death-heap his deeds had piled that day.    Ill hour for Sigmund's fellows! they fall like the seeded hay   Before the brown scythes' sweeping, and there the Isle-king fell   In the fore-front of his battle, wherein he wrought right well,   And soon they were nought but foemen who stand upon their feet   On the isle-strand by the ocean where the grass and the sea-sand meet.    And now hath the conquering War-king another deed to do,   And he saith: \"Who now gainsayeth King Lyngi come to woo,   The lord and the overcomer and the bane of the Volsung kin?\"   So he fares to the Isle-king's dwelling a wife of the kings to win;   And the host is gathered together, and they leave the field of the dead;   And round as a targe of the Goth-folk the moon ariseth red.    And so when the last is departed, and she deems they will come not aback,   Fares Hiordis forth from the thicket to the field of the fateful wrack,   And half-dead was her heart for sorrow as she waded the swathes of the        sword.   Not far did she search the death-field ere she found her king and lord   On the heap that his glaive had fashioned: not yet was his spirit past,   Though his hurts were many and grievous, and his life-blood ebbing fast;   And glad were his eyes and open as her wan face over him hung,   And he spake:                \"Thou art sick with sorrow, and I would thou wert not so young;   Yet as my days passed shall thine pass; and a short while now it seems   Since my hand first gripped the sword-hilt, and my glory was but in dreams.\"    She said: \"Thou livest, thou livest! the leeches shall heal thee still.\"    \"Nay,\" said he, \"my heart hath hearkened to Odin's bidding and will;   For today have mine eyes beheld him: nay, he needed not to speak:   Forsooth I knew of his message and the thing he came to seek.   And now do I live but to tell thee of the days that are yet to come:   And perchance to solace thy sorrow; and then will I get me home   To my kin that are gone before me. Lo, yonder where I stood   The shards of a glaive of battle that was once the best of the good:   Take them and keep them surely. I have lived no empty days;   The Norns were my nursing mothers; I have won the people's praise.   When the Gods for one deed asked me I ever gave them twain;   Spendthrift of glory I was, and great was my life-days' gain;   Now these shards have been my fellow in the work the Gods would have,   But today hath Odin taken the gift that once he gave.   I have wrought for the Volsungs truly, and yet have I known full well   That a better one than I am shall bear the tale to tell:   And for him shall these shards be smithied; and he shall be my son   To remember what I have forgotten and to do what I left undone.\"         *       *       *       *       *    Then failed the voice of Sigmund; but so mighty was the man,   That a long while yet he lingered till the dusky night grew wan,   And she sat and sorrowed o'er him, but no more a word he spake.   Then a long way over the sea-flood the day began to break;   And when the sun was arisen a little he turned his head   Till the low beams bathed his eyen, and there lay Sigmund dead.   And the sun rose up on the earth; but where was the Volsung kin   And the folk that the Gods had begotten the praise of all people to win?   _How King Sigmund the Volsung was laid in mound on the sea-side of the Isle-realm._    Now Hiordis looked from the dead, and her eyes strayed down to the sea,   And a shielded ship she saw, and a war-dight company,   Who beached the ship for the landing: so "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#7)"],["body","she fled away,   And once more to the depth of the thicket, wherein her handmaid lay:   And she said: \"I have left my lord, and my lord is dead and gone,   And he gave me a charge full heavy, and here are we twain alone,   And earls from the sea are landing: give me thy blue attire,   And take my purple and gold and my crown of the sea-flood's fire,   And be thou the wife of King Volsung when men of our names shall ask,   And I will be the handmaid: now I bid thee to this task,   And I pray thee not to fail me, because of thy faith and truth,   And because I have ever loved thee, and thy mother fostered my youth.\"         *       *       *       *       *    So the other nought gainsaith it and they shift their raiment there:   But well-spoken was the maiden, and a woman tall and fair.    Now the lord of those new-coming men was a king and the son of a king,   King Elf the son of the Helper, and he sailed from warfaring   And drew anigh to the Isle-realm and sailed along the strand;   For the shipmen needed water and fain would go a-land;   And King Elf stood hard by the tiller while the world was yet a-cold:   Then the red sun lit the dawning, and they looked, and lo, behold!   The wrack of a mighty battle, and heaps of the shielded dead,   And a woman alive amidst them, a queen with crowned head,   And her eyes strayed down to the sea-strand, and she saw that weaponed folk,   And turned and fled to the thicket: then the lord of the shipmen spoke:   \"Lo, here shall we lack for water, for the brooks with blood shall run,   Yet wend we ashore to behold it and to wot of the deeds late done.\"    So they turned their faces to Sigmund, and waded the swathes of the sword.   \"O, look ye long,\" said the Sea-king, \"for here lieth a mighty lord:   And all these are the deeds of his war-flame, yet hardy hearts, be sure,   That they once durst look in his face or the wrath of his eyen endure;   Though his lips be glad and smiling as a God that dreameth of mirth.   Would God I were one of his kindred, for none such are left upon earth.   Now fare we into the thicket, for thereto is the woman fled,   And belike she shall tell us the story of this field of the mighty dead.\"    So they wend and find the women, and bespeak them kind and fair:   Then spake the gold-crowned handmaid: \"Of the Isle-king's house we were,   And I am the Queen called Hiordis; and the man that lies on the field   Was mine own lord Sigmund the Volsung, the mightiest under shield.\"    Then all amazed were the sea-folk when they hearkened to that word,   And great and heavy tidings they deem their ears have heard:   But again spake out the Sea-king: \"And this blue-clad one beside,   So pale, and as tall as a Goddess, and white and lovely eyed?\"    \"In sooth and in troth,\" said the woman, \"my serving-maid is this;   She hath wept long over the battle, and sore afraid she is.\"    Now the king looks hard upon her, but he saith no word thereto,   And down again to the death-field with the women-folk they go.   There they set their hands to the labour, and amidst the deadly mead   They raise a mound for Sigmund, a mighty house indeed;   And therein they set that folk-king, and goodly was his throne,   And dight with gold and scarlet: and the walls of the house were done   With the cloven shields of the foemen, and banners borne to field;   But none might find his war-helm or the splinters of his shield,   And clenched and fast was his right hand, but no sword therein he had:   For Hiordis spake to the shipmen:                                    \"Our lord and master bade   That the shards of his glaive of battle should go with our lady the Queen:   And by them that lie a-dying a many things are seen.\"   _How Queen Hiordis is known; and how she abideth in the house of Elf the son of the Helper._  Then Elf asked of the two women where they would go, and they prayed that he would take them to his land, where they dwelt for long in all honour.  But the old queen, the mother of Elf, was indeed a woman wise above many, and fain would she know why the less noble of the two was dressed the more richly and why the handmaid gave always wiser counsel than her mistress. So she bade her son to speak suddenly and to take them unawares.  Then he asked the gold-clad one how she knew in the dark winter night that the dawn was near. She answered that ever in her youth she awoke at the dawn to follow her daily work, and always was she wont to drink of whey, and now, though the times were changed, she still woke athirst near the dawning.  To Elf it seemed strange that a fair queen in her youth had need to arise to follow the plough in the dark of the winter morning, and turning to the handmaid he asked of her the same question. She replied that in her youth her father had given her the gold ring she still wore, and which had the magic power of growing cold as the hours neared daybreak, and such was her dawning sign.  Then did Elf know of their exchange, and he told Hiordis that long had he loved her and felt pity for her sorrow, and that he would make her his wife. So that night she sat on the high-seat with the crown on her head, and dreamt of what had been and what was to be.    So passeth the summer season, and the harvest of the year,   And the latter days of the winter on toward the springtide wear.     BOOK II.  REGIN.   _Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund._     Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son;   There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done,   And glad was the dawn's awakening, and the noontide fair and glad:   There no great store had the franklin, and enough the hireling had;   And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land   With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand.   'Twas a country of cunning craftsmen, and many a thing they wrought,   That the lands of storm desired, and the homes of warfare sought.   But men deemed it o'er-well warded by more than its stems of fight,   And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might.   So hidden was that country, and few men sailed its sea,   And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk's company.   But fair-fruited, many-peopled, it lies a goodly strip,   'Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood's surging lip,   And a perilous flood is its ocean, and its mountains, who shall tell   What things, in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell.         *       *       *       *       *    Again, in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man   Beardless and low of stature, of visage pinched and wan:   So exceeding old was Regin, that no son of man could tell   In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell:   But the youth of King Elf had he fostered, and the Helper's youth thereto,   Yea and his father's father's: the lore of all men he knew,   And was deft in every cunning, save the dealings of the sword:   So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned, that men trowed his every word;   His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight   With the latter days of sorrow; all tales he told aright;   The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he;   And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea;   Nor might any learn him leech-craft, for before that race was made,   And that man-folk's generation, all their life-days had he weighed.  In this land of the Helper and Elf, his son, dwelt Hiordis, and here her son, the last of the Volsungs, was born. The babe had eyes of such wondrous brightness that the folk shrank from him, while they rejoiced over his birth, but his mother spake to the babe as to one who might understand, and she told him of Sigmund and Volsung, of their wars and their troubles and their joys. Then she gave him to her maids to bear him to the kings of the land that they might rejoice with her.    But there sat the Helper of Men with King Elf and his Earls in the hall,   And they spake of the deeds that had been, and told of the times to befall,   And they hearkened and heard sweet voices and the sound of harps draw nigh,   Till their hearts were exceeding merry and they knew not wherefore or why:   Then, lo, in the hall white raiment, as thither the damsels came,   And amid the hands of the foremost was the woven gold aflame.    \"O daughters of earls,\" said the Helper, \"what tidings then do ye bear?   Is it grief in the merry morning, or joy or wonder or fear?\"    Quoth the first: \"It is grief for the foemen that the Masters of God-home        would grieve.\"    Said the next: \"'Tis a wonder of wonders, that the hearkening world shall        believe.\"    \"A fear of all fears,\" said the third, \"for the sword is uplifted on men.\"    \"A joy of all joys,\" said the fourth, \"once come, and it comes not again!\"         *       *       *       *       *    \"What then hath betid,\" said King Elf, \"do the high Gods stand in our gate?\"    \"Nay,\" said they, \"else were we silent, and they should be telling of fate.\"    \"Is the bidding come,\" said the Helper, \"that we wend the Gods to see?\"    \"Many summers and winters,\" they said, \"ye shall live on the earth, it may      be.\"         *       *       *       *       *    \"Speak then,\" said the ancient Helper, \"let the worst and the best be said.\"         *       *       *       *       *    They said: \"The earth is weary: but the tender blade hath sprung,   That shall wax till beneath its branches fair bloom the meadows green;   For the Gods and they that were mighty were glad erewhile with the Queen.\"    Said King Elf: \"How say ye, women? Of a King new-born do ye tell,   By a God of the Heavens begotten in our fathers' house to dwell?\"    \"By a God of the Earth,\" they answered; \"but greater yet is the son,   Though long were the days of Sigmund, and great are the deeds he hath done.\"    Then she with the golden burden to the kingly high-seat stepped   And away from the"]]]
