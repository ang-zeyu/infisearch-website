Magnetism was equally out of the question, since no conceivable arrangement of magnets could have brought about the movements I had seen. Either I was hypnotised, and imposed upon, or else this man had discovered what had been unknown to science. His earnest and straightforward manner was not that of a mountebank. There had been no attempt to surround his work with mystery, and cloak his demonstration in unmeaning verbiage. It is true I had never heard of him in the world of science, but after all an outsider often makes a great discovery under the nose of the professors.  \"Am I to understand,\" said I, \"that you have found a way of navigating both the atmosphere and the ether?\"  \"As you see,\" he replied, briefly.  \"What the model has done, you are able to do on a larger scale--in a practical manner?\"  \"Assuredly. It is only a matter of size.\"  \"And you can maintain the motion?\"  \"As long as you like.\"  \"Marvellous! And how is it done?\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed the inventor, \"that is my secret. I am afraid I must not answer that question at present.\"  \"Is the plan not patented?\"  \"No. The fact is, I have not yet investigated the subject as fully as I would like. My mind is not quite clear as to the causes of the phenomena. I have discovered a new field of research, and great discoveries are still to be made in it. Were I to patent the machine, I should have to divulge what I know. Indeed, but for the sake of my daughter, I am not sure that I should ever patent it. Even as it stands, it will revolutionise not merely our modes of travel, but our industries. It has been to me a labour of love, not of money; and I would gladly make it a gift of love to my fellowmen.\"  \"It is the right spirit,\" said I; \"and I have no doubt that a grateful world would reward you.\"  \"I wouldn't like to trust it,\" replied Mr. Carmichael, with a smile and shrug of the shoulders. \"How many inventors has it doomed to pine in poverty and neglect, or die of a broken heart? How often has it stolen, aye stolen, the priceless fruits of their genius and labour? Speaking for myself, I don't complain; I haven't had much to do with it. My withdrawal from it has been voluntary. I was born in the south of Scotland, and educated for the medical profession; but I emigrated to America, and was engaged in one of Colonel Fremont's exploring expeditions to the Rocky Mountains. After that I was appointed to the chair of Physical Science in a college of Louisville, Kentucky, where my daughter was born. One day, when I was experimenting to find out something else, I fell by accident upon the track of my discovery, and ever since I have devoted my life to the investigation. It appeared to me of the very highest importance. As time went on, I grew more and more absorbed in it. Every hour that I had to give to my official and social duties seemed thrown away. A man cannot serve two masters, and as I also found it difficult to carry on my experiments in secrecy, I resigned my post. I had become a citizen of the United States, but my wife was a Welshwoman, and had relations in England. So we came to London. When she died, I settled in this isolated spot, where I could study in peace, enjoy the fresh air, and easily get the requisite books and apparatus. Here, with my daughter, I live a very secluded life. She is my sole companion, my housekeeper, my servant, and my assistant in the laboratory. She knows as much about my machine, and can work it as well as I do myself. Indeed, I don't know what I should have done without her. She has denied herself the ordinary amusements of her age. Her devotion to me has been beautiful.\"  The voice of the old man trembled, and I fancied I could read in his hollow eyes the untold martyrdom of genius.  \"At last,\" he continued, \"I have brought the matter into a practical shape, and like many other inventors, for the first time I stand in need of advice. Happening to see your article in the Magazine, I resolved to invite you to come and see what I have done in hopes that you might be able to advise and perhaps help me.\"  \"I think,\" said I, after a moment's reflection, \"I think the next thing to be done is to make a large working machine, and try it on a voyage.\"  \"Quite so,\" he replied; \"and I am prepared to build one that will go to any part of the earth, or explore the higher regions of the atmosphere, or go down under the sea, or even make a trip to one of the nearer planets, Mars or Venus as the case may be. But I am poor; my little fortune is all but exhausted, and here, at the end of the race, within sight of the goal, I lack the wherewithal to reach it. Now, sir, if you can see your way to provide the funds, I will give you a share in the profits of the invention.\"  I pondered his words in silence. Visions of travel through the air in distant lands, above the rhododendron forests of the Himalayas, or the green Savannahs of the Orinoco, the coral isles of the Pacific; yea, further still, through the starlit crypts of space to other spheres were hovering in my fancy. The singular history of the man, too, had touched my feelings. Nevertheless, I hesitated to accept his offer there and then. It was hardly a proposal to decide upon without due consideration.  \"I will think it over and let you know,\" said I at length. \"Have you any objection to my consulting Professor Gazen, the well-known astronomer? He is a friend of mine. Perhaps he will be able to assist us.\"  \"None whatever, so long as he keeps the affair to himself. You can bring him to see the experiments if you like. All I reserve is that I shall not be asked to explain the inner action of the machine. That must remain a secret; but some day I hope to show you even that.\"  \"Thanks.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE ELECTRIC ORRERY.   \"Half-moon Junction! Change here for Venus, Mercury, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune!\"  So I called in the style of a Clapham railway porter, as I entered the observatory of Professor Gazen on the following night.  \"What is the matter?\" said he with a smile. \"Are you imitating the officials of the Universal Navigation Company in the distant future?\"  \"Not so distant as you may imagine,\" I responded significantly; and then I told him all that I had seen and heard of the new flying machine.  The professor listened with serious attention, but manifested neither astonishment nor scepticism.  \"What do you think about it?\" I asked. \"What should I do in the case?\"  \"Well, I hardly know,\" he replied doubtfully. \"It is rather out of my line, and after my experience with Mars the other night, I am not inclined to dogmatise. At all events, I should like to see and try the machine before giving an opinion.\"  \"I will arrange for that with the inventor.\"  \"Possibly I can find out something about him from my American friends--if he is genuine. What's his name again?\"  \"Carmichael--Nasmyth Carmichael.\"  \"Nasmyth Carmichael,\" repeated Gazen, musingly. \"It seems to me I've heard the name somewhere. Yes, now I recollect. When I was a student at Cambridge, I remember reading a textbook on physics by Professor Nasmyth Carmichael, an American, and a capital book it was--beautifully simple, clear, and profound like Nature herself. Professors, as a rule, and especially professors of science, are not the best writers in the world. Pity they can't teach the economy of energy without wasting that of their readers. Carmichael's book was not a dead system of mathematics and figures, but rather a living tale, with illustrations drawn from every part of the world. I got far more help from it than the prescribed treatises, and the best of that was a liking for the subject. I believe I should have been plucked without it.\"  \"The very man, no doubt.\"  \"He was remarkably sane when he wrote that book, whatever he is now. As to his character, that is another question. Given a work of science, to find the character of the author. Problem.\"  \"I shall proceed cautiously in the affair. Before I commit myself, I must be satisfied by inspection and trial that there is neither trickery nor self-delusion on his part. We can make some trial trips, and gain experience before we attempt to leave the world.\"  \"If you take my advice you will keep to the earth altogether.\"  \"Surely, if we can ascend into the higher regions of the atmosphere, we can traverse empty space. You would have me stop within sight of the goal. The end of travel is to reach the other planets.\"  \"Why not say the fixed stars when you are about it?\"  \"That's impossible.\"  \"On the contrary, with a vessel large enough to contain the necessaries of life, a select party of ladies and gentlemen might start for the Milky Way, and if all went right, their descendants would arrive there in the course of a few million years.\"  \"Rather a long journey, I'm afraid.\"  \"What would you have? A million years quotha! nay, not so much. It depends on the speed and the direction taken. If they were able to cover, say, the distance from Liverpool to New York in a tenth of a second, they would get to Alpha in the constellation Centaur, perhaps the nearest of the fixed stars, in twenty or thirty years--a mere bagatelle. But why should we stop there?\" went on Gazen. \"Why should we not build large vessels for the navigation of the ether--artificial planets in fact--and go cruising about in space, from universe to universe, on a celestial Cook's excursion--\"  \"We are doing that now, I believe.\"  \"Yes, but in tow of the Sun. Not at our own sweet will, like gipsies in a caravan. Independent, free of rent and taxes, these hollow planetoids would serve for schools, hotels, dwelling-houses--\"  \"And lunatic asylums.\"  \"They would relieve the surplus population of the globe,\" continued Gazen, warming to his theme. \"It is an idea of the first political importance--especially to British statesmen. The Empire is only in its infancy. With a fleet of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13716"],["title","A Trip to Venus: A Novel (#6)"],["body","gunboats we might colonise the solar system, and annex the stars. What a stroke of business!\"  \"Another illusion gone,\" I observed \"Think of Manchester cotton in the Pleiades! Of Scotch whiskey in Orion! However, I am afraid your policy would lead to international complications. The French would set up a claim for 'Ancient Lights.' The Germans would discover a nebulous Hinterland under their protection. The Americans would protest in the name of the Monroe Doctrine. It is necessary to be modest. Let us return to our muttons.\"  \"Everybody will be able to pick a world that suits him,\" pursued Gazen, still on the trail of his thought. \"If he grows tired of one he can look round for a better. Criminals will be weeded out and sent to Coventry, I mean transplanted into a worse. When a planet is dying of old age, the inhabitants will flit to another.\"  \"Seriously, if Carmichael's machine turns out all right, will you join me in a trip?\"  \"Thanks, no. I believe I shall wait and see how you get on first.\"  \"And where would you advise me to go, Mars or Venus?\"  The professor smiled, but I was quite in earnest.  \"Well,\" he replied, \"Mars is evidently inhabited; but so is Venus, probably, and of the two I think you will find her the more hospitable and the nearest. When do you propose to start?\"  \"Perhaps within six months.\"  \"We must consider their relative distances from the earth. By the way, I don't think you have seen my new electrical orrery.\"  \"An electrical orrery,\" I exclaimed. \"Surely that is something new!\"  \"So far as I am aware; but you never know in these days. There is nothing new under the sun, or even above it.\"  So saying, he opened a small door in the side of the observatory, and, ushering me into a very dark apartment, closed it behind us.  \"Follow me, there is no danger,\" said he, taking me by the arm, and guiding me for several paces into the darkness.  At length we halted, and I looked all around me, but was unable to perceive a single object.  \"Where are we?\" I enquired; \"in the realms of Chaos and Old Night?\"  \"You are now in the centre of the Universe,\" replied Gazen; \"or, to speak more correctly, at a point in space overlooking the solar system.\"  \"Well, I can't see it,\" said I. \"Have you got such a thing as a match about you?\"  \"Let there be light!\" responded Gazen in a reverent manner, and instantly a soft, weird radiance was over all. The contrast of that sudden illumination with the preceding darkness was electrical in more senses than one, and I could not repress a cry of genuine admiration.  A kind of twilight still reigned, and after the first moment of surprise, I perceived that we were standing on a light metal gangway in the middle of a great hollow cell of a luminous black or dark blue colour, relieved by innumerable bright points, and resembling the night sky in miniature.  \"I need hardly say that is a model of the celestial sphere,\" whispered Gazen, indicating the starry vault.  \"It is a wonderful imitation,\" I responded, my awestruck eyes wandering over the mysterious tracts of the Milky Way and the familiar constellations of the mimic heavens. \"May I ask how it is done--how you produce that impression of infinite distance?\"  \"By means of translucent shells illuminated from behind. The stars, of course, are electric lamps, and some of them, as you see, have a tinge of red or blue.\"  Most of the light, however, came from a brilliant globe of a bluish lustre, which appeared to occupy the centre of the crystal sphere, and was surrounded by a number of smaller and fainter orbs that shone by its reflected rays.  \"This, again, is a model of the solar system,\" said Gazen. \"The central luminary is, of course, the sun, and the others are the planets with their satellites.\"  \"They seem to float in air.\"  \"That is because their supports are invisible, or nearly so. Both their lights and periodic motions are produced by the electric current.\"  \"Surely they are not moving now?\"  \"Oh, yes, and with velocities proportionate to those of the real bodies; but you know that whilst the actual movements of the sun and planets are so rapid, the dimensions of the system are so vast that if you could survey the whole from a standpoint in space, as we are supposed to do, it would appear at rest. Let us look at them a little closer.\"  I followed Gazen along the gangway which encircled the orrery, and allowed us to survey each of the planets closer at hand.  \"This kind of place would make a good theatre for a class in astronomy,\" said I, \"or for the meetings of the Interplanetary Congress of Astronomers, in the year 2000. You can turn on the stars and planets when you please. I wish you would give me a lecture on the subject now. My knowledge is a little the worse for wear, and a man ought to know something of the worlds around him--especially if he intends to visit them.\"  \"I should only bore you with an old story.\"  \"Not at all. You cannot be too simple and elementary. Regard me as a small boy in the stage of      \"'Twinkle, twinkle, little star,       How I wonder what you are!'\"  \"Very well, my little man, have you any idea how many stars you can see on a clear night?\"  \"Billions.\"  \"No, Tommy. You are wrong, my dear boy. Go to the foot of your class. With the naked eye we can only distinguish three or four thousand, but with the telescope we are able to count at least fifty millions. They are thickest in the Milky Way, which, as you can see, runs all round the heavens, over your head, and under your feet, like an irregular tract of hazy light, a girdle of stars in short. Of course we cannot tell how many more there are beyond the range of vision, or what other galaxies may be scattered in the depths of space. The stars are suns, larger or smaller than our own, and of various colours--white, blue, yellow, green, and red. Some are single, but others are held together in pairs or groups by the force of gravitation. From their immense distance they appear fixed to us, but in reality they are flying in all directions at enormous velocities. Alpha, of the constellation Cygnus, for example, is coming towards us at a speed of 500 million leagues per annum, and some move a great deal faster. Most of them probably have planets circling round them in different stages of growth, but these are invisible to us. Here and there amongst them we find luminous patches or 'nebulæ,' which prove to be either clusters of stars or stupendous clouds of glowing gases. Our sun is a solitary blue star on the verge of the Milky Way, 20 billion miles from Alpha Centauri his next-door neighbour. He is travelling in a straight line towards the constellation Hercules at the rate of 20,000 miles an hour, much quicker than a rifle bullet; and, nevertheless, he will take more than a million years to cover the distance. Eight large or major planets, with their satellites, and a flock of minor planets or planetoids, are revolving round him as their common centre and luminary at various distances, but all in the same direction. The orbits, or paths, about the sun are ovals or ellipses, almost circular, of which the sun occupies one focus, and they are so nearly in one plane, or at one level, that if seen from the sun, they would appear to wander along a narrow belt of the heavens, called the zodiac, which extends a few degrees on each side of the Elliptic or apparent course of the sun against the stars. The planets are all globes, more or less flat at the poles, like an orange, and each is turning and swaying on its axis, thus exposing every part to the light and warmth of the sun. They are divided by the planetoids into an inner and an outer band. The inner four are Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars; the outer four are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Moreover, a number of comets and swarms of meteoric stones or meteorites are circulating round the sun in eccentric paths, which cross those of the planets. Such is the solar system--a lonely archipelago in the ethereal ocean--a little family of worlds.\"  \"Not without its jars, I'm afraid.\"  \"The sun is chief of the clan,\" continued Gazen, \"and keeps it together by the mysterious tie of gravitation. While flying through space, he turns round his own axis like a rifle bullet in 25 or 26 days. His diameter is 860,000 miles, and although he is not much denser than sea-water, his mass is over 700 times greater than the combined mass of all his retinue. Gravity on his surface being 28 times stronger than on the earth, a piece of timber would be as heavy as gold there, and a stone let fall would drop 460 feet the first second instead of 16 feet as here. He is built of the same kind of matter as the earth and other planets, but is hotter than the hottest electric arc or reverberatory furnace. Apparently his glowing bulk is made up of several concentric shells like an onion. First there is a kernel or liquid nucleus, probably as dense as pitch. Above it is the photosphere, the part we usually see, a jacket of incandescent clouds, or vapours, which in the telescope is seen to resemble 'willow leaves,' or 'rice grains in a plate of soup,' and in the spectroscope to reveal the rays of iron, manganese, or other heavy elements. What we call 'faculæ' (or little torches), are brighter streaks, not unlike some kinds of coral. The 'Sunspots' are immense gaps or holes in the photosphere, some of them 150,000 miles in diameter, which afford us a peep at the glowing interior. There are different theories as to their nature, hence they provide rival astronomers with an excellent opportunity of spotting each other's reputations. For instance, I look upon them as eruptions, and Professor Sylvanus Pettifer Possil (my pet aversion) regards them as cyclonic storms; consequently we never lose an opportunity of erupting and storming at each other. Above the photosphere comes a stratum of cooler vapours and gases, namely, hydrogen and helium, a very light element recently found on the earth, along with"]]]
