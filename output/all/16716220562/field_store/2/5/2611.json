Again, armour for war was much lighter and less complete than that used for the tilt yard, where protection to the wearer was more considered than his ability to hurt his opponent. The greater substance of such armour and its frequent enrichment with engraving and gilding no doubt led to the preservation of this class of defence. Chain mail suffered extremely by rust and neglect, and even plate armour was subject to the same deterioration. It is consequently not to be wondered at that little or no armour of a date previous to the fifteenth century is to be seen in this collection. On Henry VIII's death the first inventory of the Royal collection was made, and this includes the armour and arms at Greenwich, and arms and artillery at the Tower of London which, from the time of Henry VIII, was one of the sights for foreigners of distinction. In the troubles of the Civil War the arms were drawn out, and there is no doubt much, both of arms and armour, was used and lost. The Protector took one suit, and it was not till 1660 that the armour, which had meanwhile been brought to London, was collected, and, with the weapons still in the store, were formed into a kind of museum. It is to that period that may be traced most of the grotesque stories associated with the collection. At various subsequent periods additions were made to the collection, and it was arranged in such manner as suited the knowledge of the day. Series of figures of kings of England and famous persons were made and added to or changed on the death of the sovereign. In later times the whole has been arranged by Sir Samuel Meyrick. Mr. Hewitt, and Mr. Planché, and in 1859 Mr. Hewitt drew up the first catalogue of the contents.  The mounted figures from 1826 till 1883 stood in a long gallery adjoining the south side of the Tower, but at the latter date this was pulled down, and the figures removed to the top floor. Within the last few years the floor below has been used for the later arms, but the lighting of the rooms and their shape, with various other causes, prevent any strictly chronological arrangements of the collection, many objects of which also belong to long periods of time.  The arms and armour are now placed on the two upper floors of the White Tower, the earlier weapons and all the armour, being on the top floor, while the later weapons and the Indian arms and armour, with various personal relics, are placed on what is the third stage or second floor. To this the visitor ascends by a circular staircase in the south front of the Tower. At the foot observe a brass plate recording the finding in 1674 of the supposed remains of the \"Princes in the Tower,\" Edward V and his brother Richard Duke of York. The visitor then enters the Chapel of St. John, and on leaving passes into the smaller of the two rooms on this floor.  At the end of the room is a Persian horse armour of brass scales connected by chain mail. Near this is the quilted armour of the Burmese General Maha Bundoola, killed in 1824. At the other end of the room is a large bell from Burmah, presented by the late General Sir William Gomme, G.C.B., and near it are two figures with Japanese armour, one of them presented to Charles II when prince by the Mogul. It is interesting as being one of the earliest examples of Eastern armour which has an authentic record of its presence in this country, and it also exhibits the persistence in early forms so common in the East. The cases on either hand contain weapons, helmets, and armour from most parts of our Indian Empire, as well as weapons from Cabul, Persia, Africa, America, and the South Seas. Some of these were presented by the Honourable East India Company, some were acquired by purchase after the Great Exhibition of 1851, and others have been added at various times. In the centre of the room are models showing the Tower buildings in the years 1842 and 1866.  The Large Room is now entered, and on the left is a case containing firearms, hand grenades, and a series of the _rifled_ arms in use in the British Army since 1801. These include the two Baker rifles of 1801 and 1807; the Brunswick rifle, 1836; the Minie rifle, 1851; the Enfield rifle musket, 1855; the Snider, 1865; the Martini-Henry, 1871; and the Lee-Metford magazine rifle. On the right, between two grotesque figures, called Gin and Beer, from the entrance to the Buttery of the old Palace of Greenwich, is a case containing executioners' swords (foreign), thumb-screws, the Scavenger's Daughter for confining the neck, hands, and feet, bilboes for ship use, and thumb-screws. Observe also the so-called \"Collar taken from the Spanish Armada,\" which however was here in 1547, and has been in later times filled with lead to make it more terrible. It was only a collar for detention of ordinary prisoners. A conjectural model of the rack is also shown, but the only pictorial authority for this instrument (at no time a legal punishment) is a woodcut in Foxe's Martyrs, the illustrations for which were drawn from German sources.  On the left hand are cases of European firearms of the first half of the present century, and two cannon made for the Duke of Gloucester, the son of Queen Anne. In the S.E. corner, on a platform, are several early cannon, including one, and part of another, from the wreck of the _Mary Rose_, sunk in action with the French off Spithead in 1545. These display the early mode of construction of such weapons, namely; bars of iron longitudinally welded together and encircled by hoops of the same metal. On the window side in the recesses are wall pieces, which belonged to the Honourable East India Company. The figure of Queen Elizabeth is supposed to represent her as on her way to St. Paul's Cathedral after the destruction of the Spanish Armada. Near the lift are partizans carried by the Yeomen of the Guard, and round the pillars are the sergeants' halberds used in the Army till about 1830. Observe the kettledrums captured at the battle of Blenheim, 1704.  On the left hand observe the beheading axe, which has been here since 1687, also the block on which Lord Lovat, in 1747, lost his head at one stroke for the share he took in the attempt of the Pretender in 1745.  Beyond this, against the wall, is a model by John Bell of a monument for the Great Duke of Wellington. It was presented by the late Sir Daniel Lysons, Constable of the Tower, 1890-1898. Still on the left hand, in a glass case, is the soldier's cloak on which General Wolfe expired in the moment of victory, at Quebec, 1759.  Beyond, in another case, is the uniform worn as Constable of the Tower by the Great Duke of Wellington from 1826 until his death, in 1852.  Near this is a portion of the wooden pump of the _Mary Rose_, sunk in action off the Isle of Wight in 1545.  In a case at the end of the room is a mass of fused gun flints, a relic of the fire which in 1841 destroyed the Great Store in the Tower and many thousand stand of arms, cannon, &c.  The staircase in the S.W. corner is now ascended leading to the great upper chamber, generally known as the Council Chamber, 95 feet by 40 feet, and, like the smaller room, 21 feet high. Round this top floor runs a passage cut in the thickness of the walls, with numerous openings inwards opposite the windows, and widening somewhat when forming as it does the triforium of St. John's Chapel. At the entrance are cases containing velvet-covered brigandines and canvas-covered jacks, garments which were much used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as giving protection by means of numerous small plates of metal disposed between the thicknesses of the material covering and lining them, and also great flexibility. In the cases on the right hand are specimens of chain mail in form of hoods, coats, sleeves, &c, mostly, if not all, of Eastern origin. Observe also some bronze swords and other very early weapons.  Round the walls of the two rooms are arranged the various staff weapons used in England and the continent. In the first enclosure on the left are cases in which are ancient bronze tools, weapons, and ornaments from various localities, stone implements and weapons, and a suit of bronze armour from Cumæ, an ancient Greek settlement near Naples. In the centre of the enclosure are grouped many varieties of staff weapons of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. Among them are boar spears for the chase and for war, halberds, partizans, bills, glaives, holy water sprinkles (a staff with a ball with spikes at its extremity), and the 18 foot pikes of the Civil War period.  The first case on the left contains a fine archer's salade with its original lining, from the de Cosson collection. A Venetian salade, with the stamp of the maker of the Missaglia family, a heavy salade for jousting, a combed morion and the tilting helmet of Sir Henry Lee, K.G., Master of the Armouries to Queen Elizabeth and James I. In the lower case are finely engraved and parcel gilt chamfrons for horses' heads, a gilt vamplate for the tilting lance belonging to Lord Chancellor Hatton, an officer's gorget of the time of Queen Anne, and various pieces of rich armour.  In the window recess behind are shields and horns. In the next enclosure are three foot figures of the end of the fifteenth century and commencement of the sixteenth century; the first holds a long-handled axe as used for encounters on foot in _champ clos_. The second holds a two-handled sword. The third suit is enriched with engraving, and was formerly parcel gilt, but the helmet does not belong to the suit.  In the centre of the room is an equestrian figure (III), the man wearing a fine early sixteenth-century suit of armour, bearing the Nuremberg stamp, and the horse protected by a barb richly repoussé, engraved, and formerly silvered. The designs on this display the Burgundian cross ragulé and the flint and steel. The steel or briquet is to be seen also in the hinges and in the metal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13436"],["title","Authorised Guide to the Tower of London (#3)"],["body","for the reins. It will be remembered that this design forms the _motif_ of the collar of the Golden Fleece.  The next equestrian figure (IV) shows the fluted, or as it was called crested, armour, of about 1500. The horse armour is also fluted. On the right, in the centre of the room, are two armours which belonged to Henry VIII. Of these the first (XXVIII) is that formerly described as \"rough from the hammer,\" though it has been milled or _glazed_ and no hammer marks are visible. It is a complete suit for fighting on foot in the lists, and comfort and ability to move about, have been sacrificed to perfect protection. The suit weighs about 93 lbs., and is composed of no less than 235 separate pieces of metal. Some details of construction point to a Spanish influence in the style. The second figure (XXIX), which wants the leg armour, is of the kind known as a tonlet, and has a skirt of horizontal lames engraved. The helmet bears the well-known stamp of the Missaglia family of armourers, and is very curious and massive. This armour is also for fighting on foot in _champ clos_ or the lists.  The next suit (VI) on the left is one of Henry VIII, and has been parcel gilt; the weight of the man's armour is 81 lbs. The two foot figures are those of a horseman and an officer of foot, both of Henry's time. The first bears on it Nuremberg marks; the second has an engraving of the Crucifixion on the left breast. The next equestrian figure (VII), also of Henry VIII, much resembles the last, and has at its feet extra pieces for the tilt yard. Other extra pieces which might be worn with these two suits are in the Royal Armoury at Windsor Castle.  The suit (V) on the equestrian figure in the middle of the room is one of the finest in existence. It was made by Conrad Seusenhofer, one of a family of Augsburg armourers, and given in 1514 to Henry VIII by the Emperor Maximilian. The man's armour is engraved with roses, pomegranates, portcullises, and other badges of Henry VIII and his first queen Katharine of Arragon, and has on the metal skirt which imitates the cloth _bases_ of the time the letters H and K. The horse armour, probably made afterwards in England by one of Henry's German armourers, is also covered with engraving, and has panels on which are depicted scenes from the life and death of St. George and St. Barbara, both military saints. The whole armour was formerly washed with silver, of which some traces still remain.  In the enclosure on the left is a mounted figure (XI) of about 1550, and in front are a pistol shield, one of 80 made for Henry VIII, and a helmet with grotesque mask formerly attributed to Will Somers, the king's jester, but since identified as a present from the Emperor Maximilian. In the next cases are portions of armour of Henry VIII; also of a puffed and engraved suit of the same time, and of a richly worked russet and gilt suit of George Earl of Cumberland, who in Elizabeth's time fitted out at his own cost eleven expeditions against Spain. In the archway are some combined weapons having gun barrels in the staff and pole-axe heads; also the three-barrelled weapon formerly called Henry VIII's walking staff. In the corner of the room are an old German tilting saddle, which protected the legs of the rider, who stood up in his stirrups, a large tilting lance shown as far back as the days of Elizabeth as that of Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk. At the end of the room are five suits of the second third of the sixteenth century. The centre one, which is damascened, has in front of it an extra gorget, and a placcate to strengthen the breast. The next figure (XXX) is a large suit of armour 6 feet 10-1/2 inches in height of the time of Henry VIII, though formerly incorrectly called that of John of Gaunt, of whom, of course, no armour exists. This suit weighs about 66 lbs.  Descending the room in the first enclosure is the armour (IX) of the Earl of Worcester, who died 1589. This suit is very massive, the breast and back plates together weighing 40 lbs. 3 oz. In the same enclosure are two figures made up of Maximilian armour, and a bowman and a musketeer of the Earl of Worcester's time. In the archways will be seen early forms of guns and pistols of various types and swords and other weapons.  The next mounted figure (VIII) (formerly called Sir Henry Lee) is of the middle of the sixteenth century, and the two foot figures are made up of early sixteenth-century armour.  At the side is a cuir bouilli crupper as worn by the English heavy cavalry in the sixteenth century.  The next enclosure contains an equestrian figure (X) of Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, the favourite of Elizabeth. This fine suit bears all over it the badge of the Ragged Staff, and is engraved with the badges and collars of the Garter and of the Order of St. Michael of France. The suit was made between 1566 and 1588, and is of very great interest as one of the very few known which also possesses the extra pieces for the tilt yard, viz.: the Grandguard and the Passguard, ornamented like the suit, which with them weighs about 83-1/2 lbs. It will be seen that the extra pieces are for the left side, and the helmet has no air holes on that side, as the tilters passed left arm to left arm on either side of the tilt or barrier. The two foot figures are of about the same date.  The next mounted figure (XII) is one still showing the gilt enrichment so many of these suits for the tilt yard originally had. It was attributed to Robert Earl of Essex, another favourite of his Queen, but has now been identified as the armour made by Jacobe Topf, for Sir John Smith, cousin german to Edward VI, and a great military writer of the sixteenth century. Many other pieces of this suit are in the Royal collection in Windsor Castle. The two foot figures came from the Great Armoury at Malta. Beyond the passage are a mounted figure showing how the lance was held when jousting at the tilt or barrier in the sixteenth century and later, and inferior suits for horsemen, and some other suits from Malta.  On leaving the large room, in the case in the archway will be seen axes, horsemen's hammers and maces, all designed for breaking and rending armour. Observe also various forms of the bayonet, from the early plug bayonet to the later socketed type of that weapon.  The first case on the right contains crossbows of various types. This weapon, at no time our national arm, was used for the defence of fortresses, and later on for sport. The heavy kind were bent by means of arrangements of pulleys, the windlass, or a kind of lifting jack called the Cranequin or Cric. The lighter forms were bent by an attached lever called the Goat's Foot. Specimens of these are in the case, as also two bowstaves from the wreck of the _Mary Rose_, 1545, and some leaden sling bullets from the battle field of Marathon. In the next case are firearms of early types. Among these observe two guns which belonged to Henry VIII, both of them breechloaders on a system resembling the modern Snider rifle. Note also the German Reiter wheel-lock pistols, with ball pommel; the William III match-lock, with plug bayonet stuck in the muzzle; the bandoliers, each containing twelve charges of powder and a bullet bag; the Vauban lock, combining the flint and match; also a still earlier form of this lock of English make. Montecucuh says he had similar locks made, having seen them used still earlier by the Turks.  The next case contains rapiers and swords and bucklers. Observe the raised bars on the latter, to entangle and break the sword-point. The mounted figure in brown armour shows the equipment of the cavalry in the early part of the seventeenth century, the armour being browned or blacked to prevent rust and to avoid detection at a distance.  The figure (XXIV) in the first enclosure is that of James II. It will be seen that it only consists of a headpiece, breast and back plates, and a long gauntlet to protect the bridle arm. All the pieces bear the King's initials, and the face guard is pierced with the design of the Royal Arms. The next equestrian figure is a gilt suit of Charles I (XIX), said to have been given to him by the City of London. It is the latest complete suit in the collection, and was probably never worn by him. In the centre of the room is a case containing gun locks, powder flasks, and other pieces for the furnishing of a soldier's equipment. The cannon were made for the instruction of Charles II when a prince. In the wall case observe with other objects two swine feathers, or feather staffs, having one long and two short blades which can be concealed in the shaft, also a German Calendar sword with the saints' days marked in gold, and other swords. Below are two _waistcoat_ cuirasses opening down the front.  In the next enclosure on the right is a mounted figure (XVIII) of Charles I when young. The armour is apparently of French make, and is very interesting as being a double suit--that is, it represents the equipment of the cuirassier or cavalryman of about 1610, and then by removing the helmet and the armour for the arms and legs, and substituting the pott and the short thigh defences (in the small glass case) we have the equipment of the foot soldier as seen in the figures of pikemen on the other side of the room. The small silvered cap and breast and back in another glass case was made for Charles II when prince.  In a table case are a gun and pistol dated respectively 1614 and 1619, made for Charles I when Prince of Wales. The gun is not quite perfect, but the two weapons are the earliest examples of _flint locks_ in the collection. Note also a fine wheel lock of about 1600. The gunner's axe was used for laying cannon, and has on its shaft scales showing the size of cannon balls of stone, iron, lead, and slag. It belonged to the Duke of Brunswick Luneburg. The last enclosure contains a suit (XVII) of richly decorated armour given to Henry Prince of Wales by the Prince de Joinville."]]]
