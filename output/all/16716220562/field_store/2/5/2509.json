You shall receive by the next post the _Tempi_ of the Sonata marked in accordance with Maelzel's metronome. Prince Paul Esterhazy's courier, De Smidt, took the Quintet and the Sonata with him. You shall also have my portrait by the next opportunity, as I understand that you really wish for it.  Farewell! Continue your regard for me,  Your friend,  BEETHOVEN.  All sorts of pretty compliments to your pretty wife!!! From me!!!!   261.  TO RIES.  Vienna, April 16, 1819.  DEAR RIES,--  Here are the _Tempi_ of the Sonata.  1st Allegro, Allegro (alone), erase the _assai_. Maelzel's metronome [half-note] = 138.  2d movement, Scherzoso. Maelzel's metronome [half-note] = 80.  3d movement, Maelzel's metronome [eighth-note] = 92.  Observe that a previous bar is to be inserted here, namely:--  [Music: New bar. Piano Staves (treble & bass), D major, 6/8 time.]  4th movement, Introduzione--largo. Maelzel's metronome [sixteenth-note] = 76.  5th and last movement, 3/4 time. Maelzel's metronome [half-note] = 144.  [Music: Treble clef, B-flat major.]  Pray forgive the confused way in which this is written. It would not surprise you if you knew my situation; you would rather marvel that I accomplish so much in spite of it. The Quintet can no longer be delayed, and must shortly appear; but not the Sonata, until I get an answer from you and the check, which I long to see. The name of the courier is De Smidt, by whom you will receive both the Quintet and Sonata. I beg you will give me an immediate answer. I will write more fully next time.  In haste, your  BEETHOVEN.   262.  TO RIES.  April 19, 1819.  MY DEAR FRIEND,--  I ask your forgiveness a thousand times for the trouble I cause you. I cannot understand how it is that there are so many mistakes in the copying of the Sonata. This incorrectness no doubt proceeds from my no longer being able to keep a copyist of my own; circumstances have brought this about. May God send me more prosperity, till ---- is in a better position! This will not be for a whole year to come. It is really dreadful the turn affairs have taken, and the reduction of my salary, while no man can tell what the issue is to be till the aforesaid year has elapsed.  If the Sonata be not suitable for London, I could send another, or you might omit the _Largo_, and begin at once with the _Fugue_ in the last movement, or the first movement, _Adagio_, and the third the _Scherzo_, the _Largo_, and the _Allegro risoluto_. I leave it to you to settle as you think best. This Sonata was written at a time of great pressure. It is hard to write for the sake of daily bread; and yet I have actually come to this!  We can correspond again about my visit to London. To be rescued from this wretched and miserable condition is my only hope of deliverance, for as it is I can neither enjoy health, nor accomplish what I could do under more favorable auspices.   263.  TO THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY IN LAIBACH.[1]  Vienna, May 4, 1819.  I fully appreciate the high compliment paid to me by the respected members of the Philharmonic Society, in acknowledgment of my poor musical deserts, by electing me honorary member of their Society, and sending me the diploma through Herr von Tuscher; and as a proof of my sense of this honor, I intend in due course to forward to the Society an unpublished work of mine.[2] Moreover, at any time when I can be of use to the Society, I shall be prepared to forward their wishes.  I remain, the humble servant and honorary member of the Philharmonic Society,  LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.  [Footnote 1: In Dr. Fr. Keesbacher's pamphlet, \"_The Philharmonic Society in Laibach, from 1702 to 1862_,\" he says:--\"The Philharmonic Society, always anxious to add to its lustre by attracting honorary members, resolved to appoint the great master of harmony as one of these. This idea had previously occurred to them in 1808. At that time they asked Dr. Anton Schmidt whether he thought that the election of Beethoven, and also Hummel's son, would contribute to the advancement of the Society. On that occasion the Society appear to have had recourse to Haydn for the composition of a Canon; whether they applied to him for a new one or an already existing one is not known. Schmidt replied, 'I, for my part, with such an object in view, would prefer giving my vote for the latter, (Hummel's son, who is second Kapellmeister, Haydn being the first, to the reigning Prince Niklas Esterhazy.) _Beethoven is as full of caprice as he is devoid of complaisance._ I have not seen Father Haydn for a long time, his residence being so distant. He is now in failing health and scarcely ever writes; I will, however, shortly call on him and make the attempt to get a Canon from him.' This discouraging picture of Beethoven, who had indeed too often a repulsive manner, might well deprive the Society of all courage to think any more of him as one of their honorary members. On the 15th of March, 1819, however, the Society prepared the diploma for Beethoven, the usually stereotyped form being exceptionally varied in his honor, and running thus:--'The Philharmonic Society here, whose aim it is to promote refinement of feeling and cultivation of taste in the science of music, and who strive by their incessant efforts to impart to the Society both inwardly and outwardly, by the judicious selection of new members, greater value, solidity, and distinction, are universally animated with the desire to see their list adorned by the name of Beethoven. The organ of this society, the undersigned directors, fulfil the general wish in thus performing _their most agreeable duty_, and giving you, sir, the strongest proof of their profound admiration, by appointing you one of their honorary members.--Laibach, March 15, 1819.'\" A fac-simile of Beethoven's handwriting is hung up in a frame under glass in the hall of the Society and affixed to Dr. Keesbacher's pamphlet.]  [Footnote 2: We are told, \"One work alone of Beethoven's in the collection of the Society bears visible marks of coming from his own hand, and that is the _Pastoral Symphony_.\" The above-mentioned copy is a MS. score (though not in his writing); on the cover is written by himself in red pencil, now almost illegible, \"Sinfonie Pastorale;\" and underneath are inscribed the following words in ink by another hand: \"Beethoven's writing in red pencil.\" This score contains various corrections in pencil. Two of these appear to be by Beethoven, but unluckily the pencil marks are so much effaced that it is difficult to decide as to the writing. In the scene \"By the Rivulet,\" where the 12/8 time begins (in B flat major), these words are written, \"Violoncelli tutti con Basso.\" The B especially recalls his mode of writing. Moreover the _tempo_ at the beginning of \"The Shepherd's Song,\" (in F, 6/8 time,) _allegretto_, is qualified by the same hand in pencil thus, _Quasi allegro_. No direct proof exists of this being sent by him.]   264.  TO F. RIES,--LONDON.  Vienna, May 25, 1819.  ... I was at the time burdened with cares beyond all I had ever in my life known,[1] caused solely by my too lavish benefits to others. Do compose industriously! My dear pupil the Archduke Rudolph and I frequently play your works, and he says that my quondam pupil does honor to his master. Now farewell! as I hear that your wife is so handsome, I venture to embrace her in imagination only, though I hope to have that pleasure in person next winter.  Do not forget the Quintet, and the Sonata, and the money, I mean the _Honoraire, avec ou sans honneur_. I hope soon to hear good news from you, not in _allegro_ time, but _veloce prestissimo_.  This letter will be given to you by an intelligent Englishman; they are generally very able fellows, with whom I should like to pass some time in their own country.  _Prestissimo--Responsio De suo amico e Maestro,_  BEETHOVEN.  [Footnote 1: In Schindler's _Beethoven's Nachlass_ there is a large calendar of the years 1819 used by Beethoven, in which he has marked, \"Arrived at Mödling May 12!!!--_miser sum pauper_.\" Carl too was again ill at that time. Beethoven took him to Blöchlinger's Institution, June 22.]   265.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  1819.  I learned with deep sorrow of your being again unwell; I trust it will only be a passing indisposition. No doubt our very variable spring is the cause of this. I intended to have brought the variations [see No. 259] yesterday; they may well boldly face the light of day, and no doubt Y.R.H. will receive an application for your consent on this point. I very much regret being only able to express a _pia desideria_ for Y.R.H's. health. I earnestly hope the skill of your Aesculapius may at length gain the victory and procure permanent health for Y.R.H.  [K.]   266.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Mödling, July 15, 1819.  I have been very ill since my last visit to Y.R.H. in town; I hope however to be much better by next week, in which case I will instantly join Y.R.H. at Baden. Meanwhile I went several times to town to consult my physician. My continued distress about my nephew, whose moral character has been almost totally ruined, has been the main cause of my illness. At the beginning of this week I was obliged to resume my guardianship, the other guardian having resigned, and much has taken place for which he has asked my forgiveness. The solicitor has also given up his office, because, having interested himself in the good cause, he has been loudly accused of partiality. Thus these endless perplexities go on, and no help, no consolation! The whole fabric that I had reared now blown away as if by the wind! A pupil of Pestalozzi, at present an inmate of the Institute where I have placed my nephew, seems to think that it will be a difficult matter for him and for my poor Carl to attain any desirable goal. But he is also of opinion that the most advisable step is the removal of my nephew to a foreign country!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],["title","Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#6)"],["body"," I hope that the health of Y.R.H., always so interesting to me, leaves nothing to be desired, and I look forward with pleasure to soon being with Y.R.H., that I may be enabled to prove my anxiety to serve you.  [K.]   267.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  1819.  May I beg the favor of Y.R.H. to inform H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig of the following circumstances. Y.R.H. no doubt remembers my mentioning the necessary removal of my nephew from here, on account of his mother. My intention was to present a petition to H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig on the subject; no difficulties however have hitherto arisen on the subject, as all the authorities concerned are in my favor. Among the chief of these are the College of Privy Councillors, the Court of Guardians, and the guardian himself, who all entirely agree with me in thinking that nothing can be more conducive to the welfare of my nephew than being kept at the greatest possible distance from his mother; moreover, all is admirably arranged for the education of my nephew in Landshut, as the estimable and renowned Professor Sailer is to superintend everything connected with the studies of the youth, and I have also some relations there, so no doubt the most desirable results may be thus attained for my nephew. Having, as I already said, as yet encountered no obstacles, I had no wish whatever to trouble H.R.H. the Archduke Ludwig, but I now understand that the mother of my nephew intends to demand an audience from H.R.H. in order to _oppose_ my scheme. She will not scruple to utter all sorts of _calumnies against me_, but I trust these can be easily refuted by my well known and acknowledged moral character, and I can fearlessly appeal to Y.R.H. for a testimony on this point for the satisfaction of H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig. As for the conduct of the mother of my nephew, it is easily to be inferred from the fact of her having been declared by the Court wholly incapable of undertaking the guardianship of her son. All that she _plotted_ in order to ruin her poor child can only be credited from her own depravity, and thence arises the _unanimous agreement_ about this affair, and the boy being entirely withdrawn from her influence. Such is the natural and unnatural state of the case. I therefore beg Y.R.H. to intercede with H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig, and to warn him against listening to the slanders of the mother, who would plunge her child into an abyss whence he could never be rescued. That sense of justice which guides every party in our just Austrian land, does not entirely exclude her either; at the same time, this _very same sense of justice_ must render all her remonstrances unavailing. A religious view of the Fourth Commandment is what chiefly decides the Court to send away the son as far as possible. The difficulty those must have who conduct the boy's education in not offending against this commandment, and the necessity that the son should never be tempted to fail in this duty or to repudiate it, ought certainly to be taken into consideration. Every effort has been made by forbearance and generosity to amend this unnatural mother, but all has been in vain. If necessary I will supply H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig with a statement on the subject, and, favored by the advocacy of my gracious master Y.R.H. the Archduke Rudolph, I shall certainly obtain justice.  [K.]   268.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  1819.  I regret to say that, owing to a judicial meeting about the affairs of my nephew (being unable to alter the hour fixed), I must give up the pleasure of waiting on Y.R.H. this evening, but shall not fail to do so to-morrow at half-past four o'clock. As for the affair itself, I know that I shall be treated with indulgence. May Heaven at length bring it to a close! for my mind suffers keenly from such a painful turmoil.  [K.]   269.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Mödling, July 29, 1819.  I heard with deep regret of Y.R.H.'s recent indisposition, and having received no further reliable information on the subject, I am extremely uneasy. I went to Vienna to search in Y.R.H.'s library for what was most suitable to me. The chief object must be to _hit off our idea at once_, and _in accordance with a high class of art_, unless the object in view should require different and more _practical_ treatment. On this point the ancient composers offer the best examples, as most of these possess real artistic value (though among them the _German Handel_ and Sebastian Bach can alone lay claim to _genius_); but _freedom_ and _progress_ are our true aim in the world of art, just as in the great creation at large; and if we moderns are not so far advanced as our _forefathers_ in _solidity_, still the refinement of our ideas has contributed in many ways to their enlargement. My illustrious musical pupil, himself a competitor for the laurels of fame, must not incur the reproach of _onesidedness, et iterum venturus judicare vivos et mortuos_. I send you three poems, from which Y.R.H. might select one to set to music. The Austrians have now learned that the _spirit of Apollo_ wakes afresh in the Imperial House; I receive from all sides requests for something of yours. The editor of the \"Mode Zeitung\" is to write to Y.R.H. on the subject. I only hope that I shall not be accused of being _bribed_--to be _at court and yet no courtier_! After that, what is not credible??!!!  _I met with some opposition from His Excellency the Obersthofmeister[1] in selecting the music._ It is not worth while to trouble Y.R.H. on the subject in writing; but this I will say, that such conduct might have the effect of repelling many talented, good, and noble-minded men, who had not enjoyed the good fortune to learn from personal intercourse with Y.R.H. all the admirable qualities of your mind and heart. I wish Y.R.H. a speedy, speedy recovery, and, _for my own peace of mind_, that I may hear some good tidings of Y.R.H.  [K.]  [Footnote 1: Probably the Obersthofmeister, Count Laurencin, by no means approved of the manner in which Beethoven searched for music, which accounts for this outbreak on the part of the irritable _maestro_.]   270.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  1819.  I have unhappily only myself to blame! I went out yesterday for the first time, feeling pretty well, but I forgot, or rather paid no attention to the fact, that, being an invalid only just recovering, I ought to have gone home early; I have consequently brought on another attack. I think, however, that by staying at home to-day, all will be right by to-morrow, when I hope to be able to wait on my esteemed and illustrious pupil without fail. I beg Y.R.H. not to forget about Handel's works, as they certainly offer to your mature musical genius the highest nourishment, and their study will always be productive of admiration of this great man.  [K.]   271.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Mödling, Aug. 31, 1819.  I yesterday received the intelligence _of a fresh recognition and homage[1] offered to the admirable qualities of your head and heart_. I beg that Y.R.H. will graciously accept my congratulations. They spring from the heart, and do not require to be suggested! I hope things will soon go better with me also. So much annoyance has had a most prejudicial effect on my health, and I am thus far from well; so for some time past I have been obliged to undergo a course of medicine which has only permitted me to devote myself for a few hours in the day to the most cherished boon of Heaven, my art and the Muses. I hope, however, to be able to finish the Mass[2] so that it can be performed on the 19th--if that day is still fixed. I should really be in despair[3] were I prevented by bad health from being ready by that time. I trust, however, that my sincere wishes for the accomplishment of this task may be fulfilled. As to that _chef-d'oeuvre_, the variations of Y.R.H., I think they should be published under the following title:--  Theme or Subject composed by L. van Beethoven, forty times varied, and dedicated to his Instructor, by the Illustrious Author.  The inquiries about this work are numerous, and yet, after all, this excellent composition may be ushered into the world in mutilated copies, for Y.R.H. yourself cannot possibly resist giving it first to one person and then to another; so, in Heaven's name, together with the great homage Y.R.H. now publicly receives, let the homage to Apollo (or the Christian Cecilia) also be made public. Perhaps Y.R.H. may accuse me of _vanity_; but I do assure you that precious as this dedication is to my heart, and truly proud of it as I am, this is certainly not my chief object. Three publishers have offered to take the work,--Artaria, Steiner, and a third whose name does not at this moment occur to me. So of the two I have named, which is to have the variations? I await the commands of Y.R.H. on this point. They are to be engraved at the cost of either of those publishers, according to their own offer. The question now is whether Y.R.H. _is satisfied with the title_. My idea is that Y.R.H. should entirely close your eyes to the fact of the publication; when it does appear, Y.R.H. may deem it a misfortune, _but the world will consider it the reverse_. May Providence protect Y.R.H., and shower down the richest blessings of His grace on Y.R.H.'s sacred head, and preserve for me your gracious regard! [On the cover] My indisposition must be my excuse with Y.R.H. for this confused letter.

The kind-hearted Archduke showed the utmost indulgence to him on this occasion as well as on many others, and even at a later period accepted the dedication of this long delayed composition.]   272.[1]  TO THE"]]]
