Then she sprang up.  \"Well, I was foolish,\" she exclaimed, \"to be afraid of dear old daddy!\"  Chester also arose, and the two walked to the railing. They stood there in the moonlight. Great clouds of black smoke poured from the ship's funnels, and streamed on to windward, casting a shadow on the white deck. They looked out to the water, stretching in every direction into the darkness. Then as if impelled by a common impulse, they looked at each other, then blushed, and lowered their eyes. The girl's hands lay on the railing. Chester saw their soft shapeliness, and noted also that there were no rings on them.  \"I'm glad I've met you,\" said Chester honestly.  \"And I'm glad, too,\" she breathed. \"Some other time you must tell me so much. I've so many questions to ask. You'll do that, won't you?\"  \"Why do you ask?\"  \"Now I must go to father. He may be uneasy.\" She held out her hand. \"Good night--what _do_ you think of me? Am I a rude girl?\"  \"I heard your father call you Lucy. That's your name, isn't it?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And I may call you that, may I not? You know these ship-board acquaintances don't wait on ceremony.\"  \"But I don't know your name, either. Think of it, how we have been really confidential and we don't even know each other's name.\"  \"I know yours.\"  \"Only half of it. I've two more. How many have you?\"  \"Only two.\"  \"And they are?\"  \"Chester Lawrence.\"  \"Well, mine is Lucy May Strong--and now, goodnight.\"  He took her arm and helped her down the steps, gently, for she seemed such a frail being, one who needed just such stout arms as Chester's to lean upon. He risked the danger of meeting the father by helping her down the second flight of steps to the state-room deck.  \"Good night, Lucy.\"  \"Good night--Brother Lawrence.\"     CHAPTER V.   All Monday forenoon, Chester sat on deck reading a book which he had obtained from the ship's library. It was a most interesting story, and yet the world of gray-green water and changing clouds drew his attention from the printed page. He was beginning to realize what the fascination for the sea was which took hold of men. It would have been difficult for him to analyze or explain this feeling, but it was there; and it seemed to him that he would have been content to live out his life on that boundless ocean which presented a symbol of eternity continually before his eyes.  \"Good morning.\"  Chester started, then turned. It was Lucy's father who found a chair and drew it up to Chester's.  \"Is the book interesting?\" inquired the minister.  \"Not so interesting as this wonderful sea and sky,\" was the reply.  \"You are right,\" said the other, following the young man's gaze out to the distance. \"Our universe is now but water and air, and we are but specks floating between the two layers.\"  \"But we know that ocean and air are not all. We know there are plains and mountains, forests and growing fields; so after all our universe must include not only all we can see with our eyes, but all that comes within view of our comprehension. Do you know,\" resumed Chester after a pause, \"I have come to this conclusion, that our universe is limited only within the bounds of our faith. As we believe, and strive to convert that belief into a living faith, so shall we know and realize.\"  The preacher looked keenly at the \"Mormon,\" as if he would see the fountain of these thoughts. Chester continued:  \"But you, as a minister of the gospel, understand all these things. However, I like to think about them and express them to those who will listen\"--and as the minister was listening, the young man went on:  \"I reason it out this way: The Spirit of God--that is, His presence in influence and knowledge and power, as you so beautifully put it yesterday at the services, is everywhere in the universe. There is no place in heaven or hell, or in the uttermost bounds of space but God is there. As you also stated, we may not fully understand this infinite magnificence of God, but this has been done to help us: the Father has revealed Himself to us through his Son. The Son we can comprehend, for He was one of us. We learn from scripture that this Son had all power both in heaven and earth given him; that He was, in fact, 'heir of all things.' Now, when that fact is fixed in my mind, I connect this other with it, that we, God's children also, are joint heirs with Christ; and in fact, if we continue on in the way He trod, we shall be like Him. Now, then, what does this chain of argument lead us to? That we may follow in the footsteps of God, and where He has gone, or shall go, we may go. Think of it--no, we can't. Only for an instant can our minds dwell upon it, then we drop to the common level again, and here we are, a speck on the surface of the deep.\"  \"What is that book you are reading?\" asked the minister. He had evidently also dropped to the \"common level;\" or perhaps he had not soared with his companion.  \"This? O, this is Kipling's 'Plain Tales from the Hills.' I like Kipling, but I wish he hadn't written some very untruthful things about my people.\"  \"Has he?\"  \"Yes. It seems he made a flying visit through Salt Lake City, and took for gospel truth the lurid stories hack drivers tell to tourists so that they may get their money's worth.\"  \"Well, I don't know;--but that brings me to the point of my errand. I sought you out especially today to ask you not to talk religion to my daughter. I understand she and you had a discussion on 'Mormonism' last evening, and she slept very little all night as a result.\"  \"You are mistaken, sir; I said nothing to her about 'Mormonism.' She told me a little about--\"  \"Well, whatever it was, she was and is still ill over it. Let me tell you,--and I am sure you will believe me,--my little girl is all I have. She has been ailing for years, heart trouble mostly, with complications. A comfortable voyage with no over-excitement might help, the doctors said; and that's the main reason for this trip. She has always been interested in religious questions, which I naturally encouraged her in; but when she got mixed up somewhat with the 'Mormons,' that was quite another matter.\"  \"Why, may I ask?\"  \"Well, it excited her. It brought her in contact with undesirable people, people not of her class and standing--\"  \"Like me, for instance.\"  \"I did not say that.\"  \"You inferred it. But pardon me. I would not, for the world, do anything that would unfavorably affect your daughter.\"  \"I knew you would look at the matter sensibly. Perhaps it would be for the best if you did not meet her oftener than possible. I know it is difficult on ship-board, but for her sake you might try.\"  \"For her sake, why certainly, I'll do anything--for I want to tell you, Mr. Strong, you have a good, sweet daughter.\"  \"I'm glad you think so.\"  \"And I think a whole lot of her, I may just as well tell you. We have met but a few times, but some souls soon understand each other.\"  \"What! You don't mean--!\"  \"That we have been making love to each other,\" laughed Chester. \"O, no; not that I know; but there is such a thing as true affinity of souls, nevertheless, the affinity which draws by the Spirit of God. And so I say again plainly, that you may understand, I regard your daughter highly.\"  \"Young man, I thank you for your open manner and speech, but I beseech of you not to encourage any deeper feeling towards my daughter. She can never marry. She lives, as it were, on the brink of the grave. Now, I have been plain also with you.\"  \"I appreciate it, sir; believe me; I am profoundly sorry for her and for you; but, let me say this, seeing we are speaking plainly, if I loved your daughter, and we all knew she would die tomorrow, or next month, that knowledge would make only this difference, that my love would become all the holier. If she returned that love, we would be happy in knowing that in the life beyond we would go on and bring that love to a perfect consummation.\"  The minister looked closely again at the young man. Then, giving voice to his thoughts, asked: \"Have you studied for the ministry? Are you now a 'Mormon' missionary?\"  \"I am not an authorized 'Mormon' missionary. My studying has been no more than is expected of every 'Mormon.' Every member of our Church is supposed to be able to give a reason for the hope that is within him,--and I think I can do that.\"  \"Do you live in Utah?\"  \"No, sir; my home is in Chicago.\"  \"Chicago!--well, I--are there 'Mormons' in Chicago?\"  \"A few, as I suppose there are a few in Kansas City. I joined the 'Mormon' Church in Chicago, but I was converted in Utah.\"  \"You have been to Utah, then?\"  \"O, yes; I spent some time there and got very well acquainted with the people; and they are a good people, I tell you, sir. I know--\"  \"Yes, well, Mr.----, Lucy did tell me your name, but I have forgotten it.\"  \"My name is Lawrence--Chester Lawrence.\"  The minister had arisen as if about to go, but he now sat down again. Chester did not understand the strange twitching of the minister's lips or the pallor of his face. What had he said or done to agitate the man so much?  \"Chester Lawrence!\" repeated Mr. Strong under his breath.  \"You have never met me before, have you? Perhaps--\"  \"No; I have never met you before. No, no; of course not. There was just something come over me. I'm not very well, and I suppose I--\"  He stopped, as if he lacked words.  \"May I get you anything, a drink of water?\" suggested Chester.  \"No, no; it was nothing. Sit down again\"--for Chester also had arisen--\"and tell me some more about yourself. I am interested.\"  \"Well, my life has been very uneventful, and yet in a way, I have lived. As a boy in Chicago, I suppose, my young days passed as others; but it was when I went out west and met the 'Mormons' that things happened to me.\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"I don't mean that I had any adventures or narrow escapes in a physical way. I lived in the mountains as a miner for a time, but there are no wild animals or Indians there now, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13756"],["title","Story of Chester Lawrence (#7)"],["body","my adventures were those of the spirit, if I may use that expression,--and of the heart. Isn't that your daughter coming this way?\"  Sure enough, Lucy had found them, and came up to them beaming. Chester failed to see in her any symptoms for the worse, as her father had indicated. In fact, there certainly was a spring to her step which he had not seen before.  \"Well, I've found you at last, you run-away papa. Good morning,\" she nodded to Chester, who returned the greeting. \"Don't you know, papa, you have kept me waiting for half an hour or more to finish our game.\"  \"I'll go right now with you,\" said the father, rising.  \"Well, I don't care so much now, whether it's finished or not. I believe someone else has it anyway.\"  \"Oh, we'll go and finish the game,\" persisted Mr. Strong.  \"Perhaps Mr. Lawrence will come along,\" suggested the girl, as it seemed very proper to do.  \"Not now, thank you,\" replied Chester. \"I must finish my book before the lunch gong sounds.\"  The minister took his daughter's arm and they went along the deck to where a group was laughing merrily over the defeat and victory in the games. Chester watched them mingle with the company, then he opened his book again; but he did not complete his story at the time he had appointed.  To those who can possess their souls in peace, life on ship-board in pleasant weather is restful, and may be thoroughly enjoyed. A little world is here compactly put together, and human nature may be studied at close range. From the elegant apartments of the saloon to the ill-smelling quarters of the steerage, there is variety enough. Representatives are here from nearly \"every nation under heaven:\" every creed, every color; every grade of intelligence and worldly position, from the prince who occupies exclusively the finest suite of rooms, to the begrimed half-naked stoker in the furnace room in the depths of the vessel; every occupation; every disposition. And yet, even in this compact city in a shell of steel, one may seclude himself from his fellows and commune solely with his own thoughts or his books.  The three \"Mormon\" elders, reticent and quiet, had made few acquaintances. The Rev. Mr. Strong and his daughter, not being very well, had not been active in the social proceedings of the ship's company.  Chester Lawrence had formed an acquaintance which seemed to him to fill all requirements, so that he cared not whether he learned to know any more of his fellow travelers. And now further association with this pleasant acquaintance must stop. Well, once again he said to himself, he would be glad at sight of Liverpool, and again some deeply hidden voice protested.  Chester tried to keep his word with Mr. Strong. He made no efforts to see Lucy or talk with her, and he even evaded her as much as possible. This he could not wholly do without acting unmannerly. All were on deck during those beautiful days, and twice on Tuesday Lucy and Chester and the elders had played deck quoits, the father joining in one of them. Lucy beamed on Chester in her quiet way until she noted the change in his conduct towards her. The pained expression on the girl's face when she realized this change, went to Chester's heart and he could have cried out in explanation.  That evening Lucy found Chester in a corner of the library pretending to read. There was no escape for him as she approached. What a sweet creature she was, open-hearted and unafraid! His heart met her half way.  \"What is the matter with you, Brother Lawrence?\" she asked.  \"There is nothing the matter with me.\"  \"Then what have _I_ done?\" She seated herself, and Chester laid his book on the table. He would be plain and open with this girl. In the end nothing is gained by mystery and silence. He told her plainly what had taken place between himself and her father. She listened quietly, the tears welling in her eyes as he progressed. Then for a moment she hid her face in her hands while she cried softly.  \"I shall not ask you to break your promise,\" she said at last, \"but I did so want to learn more of the gospel--the true restored gospel. It isn't true that a discussion of these things affects me unfavorably. I am never so well as when I am hearing about and thinking of them. Perhaps father thinks so, however; I shall not misjudge him.\"  \"So I shall keep my word,\" said he, \"and if I keep it strictly, I should not now prolong my talk with you. But I have a way out of your trouble. You know Elder Malby. He is a wise man and knows the gospel much better than I. He will gladly talk to you.\"  \"Thank you. That's a good suggestion; but you--\"  \"I shall have to be content to look from afar off, or perchance to listen in silence. Good night.\"  And so it happened that the very next morning when the passengers were looking eagerly to the near approach to Queenstown, Lucy and Elder Malby were seen sitting on deck in earnest conversation. Chester promenaded at a distance with some envy in his heart; but he kept away. For fully an hour the girl and the elderly missionary talked. Then the minister, coming on deck saw them. He, no doubt, thought she was well out of harm's way in such company, for he did not know Elder Malby. When he caught sight of Chester he went up to him, took him by the arm and fell into his stride.  Their conversation began with the common ship-board topics. Then the minister asked his companion more about himself and his life. It seemed to Chester that he purposely led up to his personal affairs, and he wondered why. There were some parts of his history that he did not desire to talk about. What did this man wish to know?  \"How long did you live in Utah?\" asked the minister, after receiving little information about Chester's birth and parentage.  \"Altogether, about a year.\"  \"And you liked it out there?\"  \"Very much. The mountain air is fine; and that is truly the land of opportunity.\"  The two swung around the deck, keeping in step. Chester pressed his companion's arm close. They reached in their orbit the point nearest to Lucy and Elder Malby, then without stopping went on around.  \"I knew a man once by the name of Lawrence,\" said the minister. \"I wonder if he could be related to you.\"  Chester did not reply.  \"I don't know whether or not he ever went to Utah.\"  \"My parents were not with me in Utah. I went alone, after I was a grown man. My mother had lived there many years before, but had left. She lived in Chicago the latter part of her life; but she made a trip to Utah when she was old and feeble,--and she died there. * * * * Her grave is there now.\"  The minister now was silent. His lips twitched again. Chester once more wondered why such things should affect him. The man's arm clung to Chester firmly as if he wished support; and Chester's heart warmed to him. Was he not Lucy's father? Should he not know all he desired to know about the man who had expressed deep regard for his daughter?  \"I think you are tired,\" said Chester. \"Let's sit here and rest.\"  \"Yes; all right.\"  \"The man Lawrence whom you knew was not my father,\" continued Chester. \"That was my mother's maiden name. I don't know--I never knew my father; and shall I say, I have no wish to know a man who could treat my mother and his child the way he did. No; much as I have longed to know a father's love and care, I cannot but despise a man who becomes a father, then shirks from the responsibility which follows--who leaves the burden and the disgrace which follow parenthood outside the marriage relation to the poor woman alone. Such baseness, such cowardice, such despicable littleness of soul!--do you wonder why I don't want to know my father?\"  Well, he had done it. Lucy's father knew the truth of his dishonorable beginning. This highly cultured Christian minister was no doubt shocked into silence by his outburst of confidence. But he must know also that this occurred among a Christian community, long before either of the parties concerned knew of or were connected with the \"Mormons.\" So Chester explained this to the man at his side, who sat as if deaf to what was being said. His gaze was fixed far out to sea. His lips did not now quiver, but the lines in his face were rigid.  Chester beckoned to the daughter, and when she came, he said:  \"I think your father is not well. Perhaps he ought to go below and rest.\"  \"Father,\" cried the somewhat frightened girl, \"what is it? Are you ill?\"  The father shook himself as if to be freed from some binding power, looked at Chester and then at Lucy, smiled faintly, and said:  \"Oh, I'm all right now, but perhaps I ought to rest a bit. Will you go down with me, Lucy?\"  The daughter took his arm and was about to lead him away. He stopped and turned again to Chester.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but what was your mother's full name?\"  \"Anna Lawrence.\"  \"Thank you. All right, Lucy. Let's be going.\"  Chester watched them disappear down the companionway, then looked out to sea at the black smoke made by a steamer crawling along the horizon, from Liverpool outward bound.     CHAPTER VI.   A number of men and women were sitting on the promenade deck forward engaged in an earnest discussion. Just as Chester Lawrence came up and paused to listen, for it seemed to be a public, free-for-all affair, he noticed that Elder Malby was talking, directing his remarks to a young man in the group.  \"What is your objective point?\" the Elder asked. \"What do you live and work for? What is your philosophy of life by which you are guided and from which you draw courage, hope, and strength?\"  \"Oh, I take the world as it comes to me day by day, trusting to luck, or to the Lord, perhaps I had better say, for the future,\" replied the young fellow.  \"What would you think of a captain of a vessel not knowing nor caring to know from what port he sailed or what port was his destination? Who did not know the object of the voyage, knew nothing of how to meet the storms, the fog, the darkness of the sea?\"  \"Well, I'm not the captain of a ship.\"  \"Yes, you "]]]
