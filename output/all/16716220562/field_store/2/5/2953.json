A vast, motley crowd; soldiers, serving maids, boys, girls, children, students, work girls, gendarmes, etc. It is evening. The shops are decked with tiny lamps; a huge lantern lights up the entrance to the Café Momus. The café is so crowded that some of the customers are obliged to seat themselves outside.  HAWKERS. (outside their shops)  Come, buy my oranges! Hot roasted chestnuts! Trinkets and crosses! Fine hardbake! Excellent toffee! Flowers for the ladies! Try our candy! Cream for the babies! Fat larks and ortolans! Look at them! Fine salmon! Look at our chestnuts! Who'll buy my carrots?  THE CROWD.  CITIZENS. What a racket!  WOMEN. What uproar!  STUDENTS and WORK GIRLS. Hold fast to me; come along!  A MOTHER. (calling her children) Lisa! Emma!  CITIZENS. Ho! make way there!  THE MOTHER. Emma, don't you hear me?  STUDENTS and WORK GIRLS. Rue Mazarin's the nearest.  WOMEN. Let's get away, I'm choking!  CITIZENS. See! the café is near!  (At the Café)  CITIZENS. Come here, waiter! Come along! Come along! Come here! To me! Some beer! A glass! Vanilla! Come along! Come along! Some beer! Some coffee! Hurry up!  SCH. (_blowing the horn_) D! D! D! what a dreadful D!  (_Haggling with the tinker._)  What's the price of the lot?  COL. (_to the clothes dealer, who has been mending a jacket for him_) It's rather shabby, but sound and not expensive.  (_He pays, and then carefully consigns the books to the various pockets of his long coat._)  (_MARCEL alone in the midst of the crowd, with a parcel under his arm, making eyes at the girls who jostle against him in the crowd._)  MAR. I feel somehow as if I fain must shout: Ho! laughing lassies, will you play at love? Let's play together, let's play the game of buy and sell: Who'll give a penny for my guileless heart?  (_Pushing through the crowd, _RUDOLPH_ and _MIMI_, arm in arm, approach a bonnet shop._)  RUD. Let's go!  MIMI. To buy the bonnet?  RUD. Hold tightly to my arm, love!  (_They enter the bonnet shop._)  (SCHAUNARD _strolls about in front of the Café Momus, waiting for his friends, and, armed with his huge pipe and hunting horn, he watches the crowd curiously._)  SCH. Surging onward--eager, breathless-- Moves the madding crowd, As they frolic ever In their wild, insane endeavor.  COL. (_comes up, waving an old book in triumph_) Such a rare copy! well-nigh unique, A grammar of Runic!  SCH. (_who arrives at that moment behind_ COLLINE, _compassionately_) Honest fellow!  MAR. (_arriving at the Café Momus, and finding_ SCHAUNARD _and_ COLLINE) To supper!  SCH. and COL. Ho! Rudolph!  MAR. He's gone to buy a bonnet.  (MARCEL, SCHAUNARD _and_ COLLINE _try to find an empty table outside the café, but there is only one, which is occupied by townsfolk. At these latter the three friends glare furiously, and then enter the café. The crowd disperses among the adjacent streets. The shops are crowded and the square becomes densely thronged with buyers who come and go. In the café there is much animation._ RUDOLPH _and_ MIMI _come out of the shop._)  RUD. (_to_ MIMI) Come along! my friends are waiting.  MIMI. Do you think this rose-trimmed bonnet suits me?  RUD. The color suits your dark complexion.  MIMI. (_looking into the window of a bonnet shop_) O what a pretty necklace!  RUD. I have an aunt a millionaire. If the good God wills to take her, Then shall you have a necklace far more fine. (_suddenly seeing_ MIMI _look round suspiciously_) What is it?  MIMI. Are you jealous?  RUD. The man in love is always jealous, darling.  MIMI. Are you then in love?  RUD. (_squeezing her arm in his_)  Yes, so much in love! Are you?  MIMI. Yes, deeply.  (_Enter from the café,_ COLLINE, SCHAUNARD _and_ MARCEL _carrying a table. A waiter follows with chairs. The townsfolks seated near seem vexed at the noise which the three friends are making, for they soon get up and walk away._)  COL. The vulgar herd I hate, just as I did Horace.  SCH. And I, when I am eating, I can't stand being crowded.  MAR. (to the waiter) Smartly!  SCH. For many!  MAR. We want a supper of the choicest!  (_MIMI and RUDOLPH joining their friends_.)  RUD. (_accompanied by MIMI_) Two places.  COL. Let's have supper.  RUD. So we have come. (_introducing Mimi_) This is Mimi, The merry flower girl; And now she's come to join us. Our party is completed-- For I shall play the poet, While she's the muse incarnate. Forth from my brain flow songs of passion, As, at her touch the pretty buds blow; As in the soul awaketh beautiful love!  MAR. (_ironically_) My word, what high falutin'!  COL. _Digna est intrari._  SCH. _Ingrediat si necessit._  COL. I'll grant only an _accessit_!  (RUDOLPH _makes_ MIMI _sit down. All being seated, the waiter returns with the menu_.)  COL. (_with an air of great importance_) Some sausage!  PAR. (_faintly in the distance_) Who'll buy some pretty toys from Parpignol?  (_Boys and girls running out from the shops and adjoining streets._)  BOYS and GIRLS. Parpignol! Parpignol!  (_Enter PARPIGNOL from the Rue Dauphin, pushing a barrow festooned with foliage, flowers and paper lanterns._)  PAR. (_crying_) Who'll buy some pretty toys from Parpignol?  CHILDREN, (_crowding and jumping round the barrow_) Parpignol! Parpignol! With his pretty barrow bright with flowers!  (_admiring the toys_)  I want the horn! and I the horse! Get away, they are mine! I want the gun! and I the whip! No, the drum shall be mine!  (_At the cries of the children, the mothers try, but without success, to lead them away from PARPIGNOL, scolding loudly_.)  MOTHERS. Ah! wait a bit, you dirty little rascals. What can it be that sets you all a-gaping? Get home to your beds, get home, lazy rascals, Or you shall all have a tidy beating.  (_The children refuse to go. One of them cries for Parpignol'S toys and his mother pulls his ear. The mothers, relenting, buy some. Parpignol moves down the street, followed by the children, pretending to play on their toy instruments_.)  PAR. (_in the distance_) Who'll buy some pretty toys of Parpignol!  (_The waiter presents the menu, which the four friends carefully scrutinize in turn._)  SCH. Bring some venison.  MAR. I'll have turkey.  RUD. (_in an undertone to MIMI_) Mimi, what would you like?  MIMI. Some custard!  SCH. And some Rhenish!  COL. Bring some claret, too!  SCH. And some lobster, only shell it! The best you've got--for a lady!  MAR. (_disconcerted at the sight of MUSETTA; to the waiter_)  And I'll have a phial of poison! (_throwing himself on a chair_)  SCH., COL. and RUD. (_turning on hearing MARCEL'S exclamation_)  Oh! Musetta!  (_the friends look pityingly at MARCEL, who turns pale_)  (_The shopwomen are going away, but stop to watch the fair stranger, and are astonished to recognize in her MUSETTA; they whisper among themselves, pointing at her._)  Look! 'tis Musetta! She! Musetta! 'Tis she! Yes! Yes! 'Tis Musetta! Oh! what swagger! My! she's gorgeous.  (_entering their shops_)  STUDENTS and WORK GIRLS (_crossing the stage_) Only look! why, there she is! Some old stammering dotard's with her, too! Yes, 'tis she! Tis she! Musetta!  (_Enter from the corner of the Rue Mazarin an extremely pretty coquettish-looking young lady. She is followed by a pompous old gentleman, who is both fussy and over-dressed._)  ALCINDORO DE MITONNEAUX. (_joining _MUSETTA_, out of breath_) Just like a valet I must run here and there. No, no, not for me! I can stand it no more.  (MUSETTA_ without noticing_ ALCINDORO_, takes a vacant seat, outside the café._) How now? Outside? Here?  MUS. (_without noticing his protests, he fearing to remain outside in the cold_) Sit down, Lulu!  ALC. (_in great irritation, sits down, and turns up his coat collar_) Such a term of fond endearment Pray do not apply to me!  MUS. Now, don't be Blue Beard, pray!  (_A waiter approaches briskly, to prepare the table and begins to serve. _SCHAUNARD_ and _COLLINE_ furtively watch _MUSETTA_. _MARCEL_ feigns the greatest indifference. _RUDOLPH_ devotes all his attention to _MIMI_._)  SCH. (_at the sight of the old gentleman with his decorations_) He's had a pretty good dose, I reckon.  COL. (_scrutinizing _ALCINDORO) The naughty, naughty elder!  MAR. (_contemptuously_) With his good young Susanna.  MIMI. (_to _RUDOLPH) And her clothes are smart, too!  RUD. The angels can't afford them.  (_A piquet of the National Guard passes across the square; some shop-keepers go home; at the corner of the street the chestnut-seller does a thriving trade; the old clothes dealer fills her barrel with clothes, and goes away with it over her shoulder._)  MUS. (_disconcerted at not being noticed by her friends_) Marcel can see me, But he won't look, the villain! And Schaunard! They provoke me past bearing! Ah! could I but beat them! If I could, I would scratch! But I only have to back me This old pelican! No matter! (_calls the waiter who has gone away_) Hi! waiter, here! (_the waiter hurriedly approaches_) See, this plate has a horrid smell of onions! (_dashes the plate on the ground; the waiter picks up the pieces_)  ALC. Don't, Musetta! do be quiet!  MUS. (_irritated, still watching MARCEL_) He won't look round! Now I could beat him!  ALC. What's the matter?  MUS. (_sharply_) I meant the waiter!  ALC. Manners! Manners! (_Takes the bill from the waiter and orders the supper._)  MUS. (_more irritated_) Such a bore! Just let me have my own way. If you please; I won't be ruled by you!  MIMI. (_looking curiously at RUDOLPH_) Do you know who she is?  MAR. You had better ask me. Well, her name is Musetta Her surname is Temptation. As to her vocation: Like a rose in the breezes, So she changes lover for lover without number. And like the spiteful screech owl, A bird that's most rapacious, The food that most she favors is the heart! Her food the heart is; Thus have I now none left! (_to his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13843"],["title","Libretto: La Bohème (#4)"],["body",", concealing his agitation_) So pass me the ragout!  SCH. (_to COLLINE_) Now the fun's at its climax, To one she speaks because the other listens.  COL. (_to SCHAUNARD_) The other will not hear, Feigns not to see the girl: which makes her mad.  RUD. (_to MIMI_) Now let me tell you I never would forgive you.  MIMI. (_to RUDOLPH_) I love you, love you fondly, Am wholly yours, my dearest! (_eating_)  COL. What's that about forgiveness?  (_coquettishly watching MARCEL, who becomes agitated_)  MUS. (_watching MARCEL; in a loud voice to MARCEL_) Why, don't you know me?  ALC. (_thinking MUSETTA spoke to him_) Well, I'm giving the order, dear.  MUS. (_as above_) But your heart is a-throbbing!  ALC. (_as above_) Not so loud.  MUS. (_to herself_) But your heart is a-throbbing!  ALC. Do be quiet!  MUS. As through the streets I wander onward merrily, See how the folk look round, Because they know I'm charming, A very charming girl. And then 'tis mine to mark the hidden longing, And all the passion in their eyes; And then the joy of conquest overcomes me, Every man is my prize!  And thus their hearts, their hearts I capture, As if by magic all my own, ah! rapture! Tis mine alone! Now you that once your love for me betrayed, Why should you be dismayed? Yet though deep in your heart Rankles the smart. You'd ne'er confess--but rather die!  (_SCHAUNARD and COLLINE rise and stand aside, watching the scene with interest, while RUDOLPH and MIMI remain seated and continue their talk. MARCEL nervously quits his seat, and is about to go, but is spell-bound by MUSETTA'S voice._)  ALC. This odious singing upsets me entirely!  (_ALCINDORO vainly endeavors to induce MUSETTA to resume her seat at the table where the supper is ready._)  MIMI. (_to RUDOLPH_) Oh! now I see that this unhappy maiden Adores your friend Marcel madly!  RUD. She once was Marcel's love; She wantonly forsook her fate, And rarer game she thought to capture!  MIMI. The love that's born of passion ends in grief; That poor, unhappy girl! She moves me to tears!  RUD. Who can revive a love that's dead?  MAR. Hold me back! hold me back!  COL. Who knows what will happen now? Goodness me! 'tis most unpleasant! Anyhow, it is for me! She is pretty, I don't doubt it; Yet I would rather have My pipe and a page of Homer!  SCH. See the braggart in a moment will give in; The snare for some is pleasant, For the biter and the bit.  (_to COLLINE_)  If such a pretty damsel Should but make eyes at you, You'd forget your mouldy classics, And run to fetch her shoe.  MUS. Ah! Marcel you are vanquished! And though your heart is breaking, You'd never let us know, (_feigning great regret_) (I must try to get rid of the old boy.) Oh! dear!  ALC. What now?  MUS. How it pains me! how it pains me!  ALC. Let's see!  MUS. My foot! Break it, tear it, I can't bear it, Do, I implore you!  ALC. (_bending down to untie her shoe_) Gently, gently!  MUS. Close by there is a boot-shop; hasten! quickly! He may have boots to please me.  ALC. What imprudence!  MUS. Ah! the torture! How these horrid tight shoes squeeze me! I'll take it off! So let it lie!  ALC. What will people say? What imprudence!  SCH. and COL. Now the fun becomes stupendous In truth, 'tis better than a play!  MUS. Hasten, hasten! Bring another pair! Go!  ALC. What imprudence! Nothing short of scandal! Musetta, shame!  (_Hides her shoe under his coat, which he hastily buttons up; hurries off the stage._)  MAR. (_greatly agitated_) Ah! golden youth! you are not dead, not dead for me, For love revives again in me; If at my door you came to greet me, My heart would straight go out to meet thee!  (_MUSETTA and MARCEL embrace with much fervor._)  MUS. Marcel!  MAR. Enchantress!  SCH. This is the final tableau! (_A waiter brings in the bill._)  RUD., COL. and SCH. The bill!  SCH. What a bother!  COL. Who bade him bring it?  SCH. Let's see.  (_Drums heard in the distance_)  RUD. and COL. Out with your coppers!  SCH. Out with your coppers, Colline, Rudolph, and you, Marcel.  MAR. We've not a rap!  SCH. I say!  RUD. I've thirty sous, no more.  MAR., SCH. and COL. I say! no more than that?  STREET ARABS, (_hastening from the right_) 'Tis the Tattoo!  WORK GIRLS, (_hastening out of the café_) 'Tis the Tattoo!  STUDENTS and CITIZENS. 'Tis the Tattoo!  (_Hastening from the left. As the Tattoo is still a long way off, the folk run hither and thither, as if uncertain from which quarter the band will appear._)  SCH. But who has got my purse?  (_They all feel their pockets which are empty; none can explain the sudden disappearance of SCHAUNARD'S purse, and they look at each other in surprise._)  STREET ARABS. Will they come along this way?  WORK GIRLS and STUDENTS. No; from there.  STREET ARABS. They are coming down this way.  WORK GIRLS and STUDENTS. Here they come!  CITIZENS. Way there!  HAWKERS. Way there!  SOME BOYS. Oh! let me see!  OTHERS. Oh! let me hear!  BOYS. Mother, do let me see!  OTHERS. Papa, do let me hear!  MOTHERS. Lisette, do be quiet! Tony, do have done! do be quiet!  MUS. (to the waiter) And my bill, please, bring to me.  (_To waiter who brings the bill_)  Thank you. Just make one bill of the two. The gentleman will pay Who came to sup with me.  RUD., MAR., SCH. and COL. Yes, he will pay!  MAR. (aside) He will pay!  SCH. and COL. Yes, he will pay!  MUS. (_placing both bills at ALCINDORO's place_) And, after this pleasant meeting, This shall be my greeting!  RUD., MAR., SCH. and COL. And, after our pleasant meeting, This shall be her greeting!  (_The crowd fills the stage and the patrol advances gradually._)  WORK GIRLS. They will come along this way.  STUDENTS, CITIZENS and HAWKERS. Yes, this way!  STREET ARABS. When it gets nearer, We'll march along beside it.  (_Several windows are opened at which mothers and their children appear and eagerly await the coming of the patrol._)  HAWKERS. In that patrol perceive The country's noble might!  STREET ARABS. Now, look out! they're coming!  STUDENTS, WORK GIRLS and CITIZENS. Do stand back, for here they come!  MAR. See, the patrol is coming!  COL. Look out that old boy Don't catch you with his darling!  RUD. See, the patrol is coming!  MAR. and SCH. Now the crowd is tremendous: T' escape will be so easy.  (_The patrol enters, headed by a gigantic drum-major, who dexterously twists his baton, showing the way._)  STREET ARABS and WORK GIRLS. And there's the drum-major!  CITIZENS and SHOP-KEEPERS. As proud as a warrior of old!  MIMI, MUS. and RUD. Quick, or you will miss them!  MAR., SCH. and COL. Quick, or you will miss them!  STREET ARABS and HAWKERS. The drum-major, look! what a dandy!  STUDENTS and WORK GIRLS. What swagger! What a figure!  STREET ARABS. There go the sappers!  CITIZENS. What a dandy!  STUDENTS and CITIZENS. Like a general he appears! He passes by and heeds us not!  WORK GIRLS. Like a general he appears! Of all our hearts the conqueror!  (_MUSETTA being without her shoe, cannot walk, so MARCEL and COLLINE carry her through the crowd, as they endeavor to follow the patrol. The mob, seeing her borne along in this triumphal fashion, give her a regular ovation. MARCEL and COLLINE with MUSETTA follow the patrol; RUDOLPH and MIMI follow arm in arm; SCHAUNARD goes next, blowing his horn; while the students, work-girls, street-lads, women and towns-folk merrily bring up the rear._)  (_Marching in time with the music, the whole vast crowd gradually moves off as it follows the patrol. Meanwhile ALCINDORO, with a pair of shoes carefully wrapped up, returns to the café in search of MUSETTA. The waiter by the table takes up the bill left by MUSETTA and ceremoniously hands it to ALCINDORO, who, seeing the amount, and perceiving that they have all left him there alone, falls back into a chair, utterly dumbfounded._)     ACT III  \"Mimi's voice seemed to go through Rudolph's heart like a death-knell. His love for her was a jealous, fantastic, weird, hysterical love. Scores of times they were on the point of separating.  \"It must be admitted that their existence was a veritable 'hell-up-on-earth.'  \"Thus (if life it was) did they live; a few happy days alternating with many wretched ones, while perpetually awaiting a divorce.\"    \"Either as a congenital defect or as a natural instinct, Musetta possessed a positive genius for elegance.  \"Even in her cradle this strange creature must surely have asked for a mirror.  \"Intelligent, shrewd, and above all, hostile to anything that she considered tyranny, she had but one rule--caprice.  \"In truth the only man that she really loved was Marcel; perhaps because he alone could make her suffer. Yet extravagance was for her one of the conditions of well-being.\"     ACT III   _Beyond the toll-gate, the outer boulevard is formed in the background by the Orleans high-road, half hidden by tall houses and the misty gloom of February. To the left is a tavern with a small open space in front of the toll-gate. To the right is the Boulevard d'Enfer; to the left, that of St. Jacques.  On the right also there is the entrance of the Rue d'Enfer, leading to the Quartier Latin.  Over the tavern, as its sign-board, hangs MARCEL's picture, \"The Passage of the Red Sea,\" while underneath, in large letters, is the inscription. \"At the Port of Marseilles.\" On either side of the door are frescoes of a Turk and a Zouave with a huge laurel-wreath round his fez. From the ground-floor windows of the tavern, which faces the toll-gate, light gleams. The plane-trees, grey and gaunt, which flank the toll-gate square, lead diagonally towards the two boulevards. Between each tree is a marble bench. It is towards the close of February; snow covers all.  As the curtain rises, the scene is merged in the dim light of early dawn. In front of a brazier are seated, in a group, snoring custom-house officers. From the tavern at intervals one may hear laughter, shouts, and the clink of glasses. A custom-house official comes out of the tavern with wine. The toll-gate is closed.  Behind the toll-gate"]]]
