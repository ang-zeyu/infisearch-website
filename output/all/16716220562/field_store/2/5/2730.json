Among white rats, which are very sexual animals, Steinach found that, when deprived of females, the males practise homosexuality, though only with males with whom they have long associated; the weaker rats play the passive part. But when a female is introduced they immediately turn to her; although they are occasionally altogether indifferent to sex, they never actually prefer their own sex.[6]  With regard to the playing of the female part by the weaker rats it is interesting to observe that Féré found among insects that the passive part in homosexual relations is favored by fatigue; among cockchafers it was the male just separated from the female who would take the passive part (on the rare occasions when homosexual relations occurred) with a fresh male.[7]  Homosexuality appears to be specially common among birds. It was among birds that it attracted the attention of the ancients, and numerous interesting observations have been made in more recent times. Thus Selous, a careful bird-watcher, finds that the ruff, the male of the _Machetes pugnax_, suffers from sexual repression owing to the coyness of the female (the reeve), and consequently the males often resort to homosexual intercourse. It is still more remarkable that the reeves also, even in the presence of the males, will court each other and have intercourse.[8] We may associate this with the high erotic development of birds, the difficulty with which tumescence seems to occur in them, and their long courtships.  Among the higher animals, again, female monkeys, even when grown up (as Moll was informed), behave in a sexual way to each other, though it is difficult to say how far this is merely in play. Dr. Seitz, Director of the Frankfurt Zoölogical Garden, gave Moll a record of his own careful observations of homosexual phenomena among the males and females of various animals confined in the Garden (_Antelope cervicapra, Bos Indicus, Capra hircus, Ovis steatopyga_).[9] In all such cases we are not concerned with sexual inversion, but merely with the accidental turning of the sexual instinct into an abnormal channel, the instinct being called out by an approximate substitute, or even by diffused emotional excitement, in the absence of the normal object.  It is probable, however, that cases of true sexual inversion--in which gratification is preferably sought in the same sex--may be found among animals, although observations have rarely been made or recorded. It has been found by Muccioli, an Italian authority on pigeons, that among Belgian carrier-pigeons inverted practices may occur, even in the presence of many of the other sex.[10] This seems to be true inversion, though we are not told whether these birds were also attracted toward the opposite sex. The birds of this family appear to be specially liable to sexual perversion. Thus M.J. Bailly-Maitre, a breeder of great knowledge and a keen observer, wrote to Girard that \"they are strange creatures in their manners and customs and are apt to elude the most persistent observer. No animal is more depraved. Mating between males, and still more frequently between females, often occurs at an early age: up to the second year. I have had several pairs of pigeons formed by subjects of the same sex who for many months behaved as if the mating were natural. In some cases this had taken place among young birds of the same nest, who acted like real mates, though both subjects were males. In order to mate them productively we have had to separate them and shut each of them up for some days with a female.\"[11] In the Berlin Zoölogical Gardens also, it has been noticed that two birds of the same sex will occasionally become attached to each other and remain so in spite of repeated advances from individuals of opposite sex. This occurred, for instance, in the case of two males of the Egyptian goose who were thus to all appearance paired, and always kept together, vigorously driving away any female that approached. Similarly a male Australian sheldrake was paired to a male of another species.[12]  Among birds generally, inverted sexuality seems to accompany the development of the secondary sexual characters of the opposite sex which is sometimes found. Thus, a poultry-breeder describes a hen (colored Dorking) crowing like a cock, only somewhat more harshly, as a cockerel crows, and with an enormous comb, larger than is ever seen in the male. This bird used to try to tread her fellow-hens. At the same time she laid early and regularly, and produced \"grand chickens.\"[13] Among ducks, also, it has occasionally been observed that the female assumes at the same time both male livery and male sexual tendencies. It is probable that such observations will be multiplied in the future, and that sexual inversion in the true sense will be found commoner among animals than at present it appears to be.  Traces of homosexual practices, sometimes on a large scale, have been found among all the great divisions of the human race. It would be possible to collect a considerable body of evidence under this head.[14] Unfortunately, however, the travellers and others on whose records we are dependent have been so shy of touching these subjects, and so ignorant of the main points for investigation, that it is very difficult to discover sexual inversion in the proper sense in any lower race. Travellers have spoken vaguely of crimes against nature without defining the precise relationship involved nor inquiring how far any congenital impulse could be distinguished.  Looking at the phenomena generally, so far as they have been recorded among various lower races, we seem bound to recognize that there is a widespread natural instinct impelling men toward homosexual relationships, and that this has been sometimes, though very exceptionally, seized upon and developed for advantageous social purposes. On the whole, however, unnatural intercourse (sodomy) has been regarded as an antisocial offense, and punishable sometimes by the most serious penalties that could be invented. This was, for instance, the case in ancient Mexico, in Peru, among the Persians, in China, and among the Hebrews and Mohammedans.  Even in very early history it is possible to find traces of homosexuality, with or without an implied disapproval. Its existence in Assyria and Babylonia is indicated by the Codex Hamurabi and by inscriptions which do not on the whole refer to it favorably.[15] As regards Egypt we learn from a Fayum papyrus, found by Flinders Petrie, translated by Griffiths, and discussed by Oefele,[16] that more than four thousand years ago homosexual practices were so ancient that they were attributed to the gods Horus and Set. The Egyptians showed great admiration of masculine beauty, and it would seem that they never regarded homosexuality as punishable or even reprehensible. It is notable, also, that Egyptian women were sometimes of very virile type, and Hirschfeld considers that intermediate sexual types were specially widespread among the Egyptians.[17]  One might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population. Aristotle says that it was allowed by law in Crete for this end. And Professor Haddon tells me that at Torres Straits a native advocated sodomy on this ground.[18] There seems, however, on the whole, to be little evidence pointing to this utilization of the practice. The homosexual tendency appears to have flourished chiefly among warriors and warlike peoples. During war and the separation from women that war involves, the homosexual instinct tends to develop; it flourished, for instance, among the Carthaginians and among the Normans, as well as among the warlike Dorians, Scythians, Tartars, and Celts,[19] and, when there has been an absence of any strong moral feeling against it, the instinct has been cultivated and, idealized as a military virtue, partly because it counteracts the longing for the softening feminine influences of the home and partly because it seems to have an inspiring influence in promoting heroism and heightening _esprit de corps_. In the lament of David over Jonathan we have a picture of intimate friendship--\"passing the love of women\"--between comrades in arms among a barbarous, warlike race. There is nothing to show that such a relationship was sexual, but among warriors in New Caledonia friendships that were undoubtedly homosexual were recognized and regulated; the fraternity of arms, according to Foley,[20] complicated with pederasty, was more sacred than uterine fraternity. We have, moreover, a recent example of the same relationships recognized in a modern European race--the Albanians.      Hahn, in the course of his _Albanische Studien_ (1854, p. 166),     says that the young men between 16 and 24 lore boys from about 12     to 17. A Gege marries at the age of 24 or 25, and then he     usually, but not always, gives up boy-love. The following passage     is reported by Hahn as the actual language used to him by an     Albanian Gege: \"The lover's feeling for the boy is pure as     sunshine. It places the beloved on the same pedestal as a saint.     It is the highest and most exalted passion of which the human     breast is capable. The sight of a beautiful youth awakens     astonishment in the lover, and opens the door of his heart to the     delight which the contemplation of this loveliness affords. Love     takes possession of him so completely that all his thought and     feeling goes out in it. If he finds himself in the presence of     the beloved, he rests absorbed in gazing on him. Absent, he     thinks of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#3)"],["body","but him. If the beloved unexpectedly appears, he     falls into confusion, changes color, turns alternately pale and     red. His heart beats faster and impedes his breathing. He has     ears and eyes only for the beloved. He shuns touching him with     the hand, kisses him only on the forehead, sings his praise in     verse, a woman's never.\" One of these love-poems of an Albanian     Gege runs as follows: \"The sun, when it rises in the morning, is     like you, boy, when you are near me. When your dark eye turns     upon me, it drives my reason from my head.\"      It should be added that Prof. Weigand, who knew the Albanians     well, assured Bethe (_Rheinisches Museum für Philologie_, 1907,     p. 475) that the relations described by Hahn are really sexual,     although tempered by idealism. A German scholar who travelled in     Albania some years ago, also, assured Näcke (_Jahrbuch für     sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. ix, 1908, p. 327) that he could     fully confirm Hahn's statements, and that, though it was     difficult to speak positively, he doubted whether these     relationships were purely ideal. While most prevalent among the     Moslems, they are also found among the Christians, and receive     the blessing of the priest in church. Jealousy is frequently     aroused, the same writer remarks, and even murder may be     committed on account of a boy.      It may be mentioned here that among the Tschuktsches,     Kamschatdals, and allied peoples (according to a Russian     anthropological journal quoted in _Sexual-Probleme_, January,     1913, p. 41) there are homosexual marriages among the men, and     occasionally among the women, ritually consecrated and openly     recognized.  The Albanians, it is possible, belonged to the same stock which produced the Dorian Greeks, and the most important and the most thoroughly known case of socially recognized homosexuality is that of Greece during its period of highest military as well as ethical and intellectual vigor. In this case, as in those already mentioned, the homosexual tendency was frequently regarded as having beneficial results, which caused it to be condoned, if not, indeed, fostered as a virtue. Plutarch repeated the old Greek statement that the Beotians, the Lacedemonians, and the Cretans were the most warlike stocks because they were the strongest in love; an army composed of loving homosexual couples, it was held, would be invincible. It appears that the Dorians introduced _paiderastia_, as the Greek form of homosexuality is termed, into Greece; they were the latest invaders, a vigorous mountain race from the northwest (the region including what is now Albania) who spread over the whole land, the islands, and Asia Minor, becoming the ruling race. Homosexuality was, of course, known before they came, but they made it honorable. Homer never mentions it, and it was not known as legitimate to the Æolians or the Ionians. Bethe, who has written a valuable study of Dorian _paiderastia_, states that the Dorians admitted a kind of homosexual marriage, and even had a kind of boy-marriage by capture, the scattered vestiges of this practice indicating, Bethe believes, that it was a general custom among the Dorians before the invasion of Greece. Such unions even received a kind of religions consecration. It was, moreover, shameful for a noble youth in Crete to have no lover; it spoke ill for his character. By _paiderastia_ a man propagated his virtues, as it were, in the youth he loved, implanting them by the act of intercourse.  In its later Greek phases _paiderastia_ was associated less with war than with athletics; it was refined and intellectualized by poetry and philosophy. It cannot be doubted that both Æschylus and Sophocles cultivated boy-love, while its idealized presentation in the dialogues of Plato has caused it to be almost identified with his name; thus in the early _Charmides_ we have an attractive account of the youth who gives his name to the dialogue and the emotions he excites are described. But even in the early dialogues Plato only conditionally approved of the sexual side of _paiderastia_ and he condemned it altogether in the final _Laws_.[21]      The early stages of Greek _paiderastia_ are very interestingly     studied by Bethe, \"Die Dorische Knabenliebe,\" _Rheinisches Museum     für Philologie_, 1907. J.A. Symonds's essay on the later aspects     of _paiderastia_, especially as reflected in Greek literature, _A     Problem in Greek Ethics_, is contained in the early German     edition of the present study, but (though privately printed in     1883 by the author in an edition of twelve copies and since     pirated in another private edition) it has not yet been published     in English. _Paiderastia_ in Greek poetry has also been studied     by Paul Brandt, _Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vols.     viii and ix (1906 and 1907), and by Otto Knapp     (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. iii, pp. 254-260) who seeks to     demonstrate the sensual side of _paiderastia_. On the other hand,     Licht, working on somewhat the same lines as Bethe (_Zeitschrift     für Sexualwissenschaft_, August, 1908), deals with the ethical     element in _paiderastia_, points out its beneficial moral     influence, and argues that it was largely on this ground that it     was counted sacred. Licht has also published a learned study of     _paiderastia_ in Attic comedy (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. vii,     1910), and remarks that \"without _paiderastia_ Greek comedy is     unthinkable.\" _Paiderastia_ in the Greek anthology has been fully     explored by P. Stephanus (_Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen_,     vol. ix, 1908, p. 213). Kiefer, who has studied Socrates in     relation to homosexuality (O. Kiefer, \"Socrates und die     Homosexualität,\" _Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. ix,     1908), concludes that he was bisexual but that his sexual     impulses had been sublimated. It may be added that many results     of recent investigation concerning _paiderastia_ are summarized     by Hirschfeld, _Die Homosexualität_, pp. 747-788, and by Edward     Carpenter, _Intermediate Types Among Primitive Folk_, 1914, part     ii; see also Bloch, _Die Prostitution_, vol. i, p. 232 et seq.,     and _Der Ursprung der Syphilis_, vol. ii, p. 564.  It would appear that almost the only indications outside Greece of _paiderastic_ homosexuality showing a high degree of tenderness and esthetic feeling are to be found in Persian and Arabian literature, after the time of the Abbasids, although this practice was forbidden by the Koran.[22]  In Constantinople, as Näcke was informed by German inverts living in that city, homosexuality is widespread, most cultivated Turks being capable of relations with boys as well as with women, though very few are exclusively homosexual, so that their attitude would seem to be largely due to custom and tradition. Adult males rarely have homosexual relations together; one of the couple is usually a boy of 12 to 18 years, and this condition of things among the refined classes is said to resemble ancient Greek _paiderastia_. But ordinary homosexual prostitution is prevalent; it is especially recognized in the baths which abound in Constantinople and are often open all night. The attendants at these baths are youths who scarcely need an invitation to induce them to gratify the client in this respect, the gratification usually consisting in masturbation, mutual or one-sided, as desired. The practice, though little spoken of, is carried on almost openly, and blackmailing is said to be unknown.[23] In the New Turkey, however, it is stated by Adler Bey that homosexual prostitution has almost disappeared.[24]  There is abundant evidence to show that homosexual practices exist and have long existed in most parts of the world outside Europe, when subserving no obvious social or moral end. How far they are associated with congenital inversion is usually very doubtful. In China, for instance, it seems that there are special houses devoted to male prostitution, though less numerous than the houses devoted to females, for homosexuality cannot be considered common in China (its prevalence among Chinese abroad being due to the absence of women) and it is chiefly found in the north.[25] When a rich man gives a feast he sends for women to cheer the repast by music and song, and for boys to serve at table and to entertain the guests by their lively conversation. The boys have been carefully brought up for this occupation, receiving an excellent education, and their mental qualities are even more highly valued than their physical attractiveness. The women are less carefully brought up and less esteemed. After the meal the lads usually return home with a considerable fee. What further occurs the Chinese say little about. It seems that real and deep affection is often born of these relations, at first platonic, but in the end becoming physical, not a matter for great concern in the eyes of the Chinese. In the Chinese novels, often of a very literary character, devoted to masculine love, it seems that all the preliminaries and transports of normal love are to be found, while physical union may terminate the scene. In China, however, the law may be brought into action for attempts against nature even with mutual consent; the penalty is one hundred strokes with the bamboo and a month's imprisonment; if there is violence, the penalty is decapitation; I am not able to say how far the law is a dead letter. According to Matignon, so far as homosexuality exists in China, it is carried on with much more decorum and restraint than it is in Europe, and he thinks it may be put down to the credit of the Chinese that, unlike Europeans, they never practice unnatural connection with women. His account of the customs of the Chinese confirms Morache's earlier account, and he remarks that, though not much spoken of, homosexuality is not looked down upon. He gives some"]]]
