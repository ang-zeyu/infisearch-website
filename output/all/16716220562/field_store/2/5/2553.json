Composed on Divine Subjects.  3. Prepared for the Lord's Supper.  By I. Watts, D.D.   Revelation 5, 9. _And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy, &c. for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us, &c._  Soliti essent (i.e. Christiani) convenire, carmenque Christo quasi Deo dicere. _Plin. In Epist._   Transcriber's Note.  There are significant differences in the numerous reprints of Isaac Watts' \"Hymns and Spiritual Songs.\" The first generation of this Project Gutenberg file was from an 1818 printing by C. Corrall of 38 Charing Cross, London.  The \"Index\" and the \"Table of the Scriptures that are Turned into Verse\" are retained, and can be found at the end of the text. The \"Table to find any Hymn by the first Line,\" however, has been omitted for the following reasons: 1. It refers to page numbers that are here expunged; and 2. In this electronic version first lines can be easily located via searches.  There are 3 books of hymns, and numbers have been added to indicate in which of these the hymns are placed. For example, \"2:38\" refers to \"Book 2, Hymn Number 38,\" and so on.  Throughout, modern numerals have been substituted for their Roman equivalents.    Preface.  The following extracts from the Doctor's preface contain the substance of his plan in the three different parts into which the Hymns are divided; the whole would have exceeded the limits of a small book.  \"Far be it from my thoughts to lay aside the Book of Psalms in public worship; few can pretend so great a value for them as myself: it is the most noble, most devotional and divine collection of poesy; and nothing can be supposed more proper to raise a pious soul to heaven than some parts of that book; never was a piece of experimental divinity so nobly written, and so justly reverenced and admired. But it must be acknowledged still, that there are a thousand lines in it which were not made for a church in our days to assume as its own. There are also many deficiencies of light and glory which our Lord Jesus and his apostles have supplied in the writings of the New Testament: and with this advantage I have composed these Spiritual Songs, which are now presented to the World. Nor is the attempt vainglorious or presuming; for in respect of clear evangelical knowledge, 'The least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than all the Jewish Prophets.' Matt. xi. 11.  \"Now let me give a short account of the following composures.  \"The greatest part of them are suited to the general state of the gospel, and the most common affairs of Christians: I hope there will be very few found but what may properly be used in a religious assembly, and not one of them but may well be adapted to some seasons either of private or public worship. The most frequent tempers and changes of our spirit, and conditions of our life, are here copied, and the breathings of our piety expressed according to the variety of our passions, our love, our fear, our hope, our desire, our sorrow, our wonder and our joy, as they are refined into devotion, and act under the influence and conduct of the blessed Spirit; all conversing with God the Father 'by the new and living Way' of access to the throne, even the person and the mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ. To him also, even 'to the Lamb that was slain and now lives,' I have addressed many a song; for thus doth the holy Scripture instruct and teach us to worship in the various patterns of Christian psalmody described in the Revelation.  \"I have aimed at ease of numbers, and smoothness of sound, and endeavoured to make the sense plain and obvious. If the verse appears so gentle and flowing as to incur the censure of feebleness, I may honestly affirm, that sometimes it cost me labour to make it so.  \"In the first part I have borrowed the sense and much of the form of the song from some particular portions of scripture, and have paraphrased most of the doxologies in the New Testament, that contain any thing in them peculiarly evangelical: and many parts of the Old Testament also, that have a reference to the times of the Messiah.  \"The second part consists of hymns whose form is mere human composure; but I hope the sense and materials will always appear divine. I might have brought some text or other, and applied it to the margin of every verse, if this method had been as useful as it was easy. If there be any poems in the book that are capable of giving delight to persons of a more refined taste and polite education, perhaps they may be found in this part; but except they lay aside the humour of criticism, and enter into a devout frame, every ode here already despairs of pleasing.  \"I have prepared the third part only for the celebration of the Lord's Supper, that, in imitation of our blessed Saviour, we may sing an hymn after we have partaken of the Bread and Wine.\"    Hymns.   Book 1. Collected from the Holy Scriptures.   Hymn 1:1. A new song to the Lamb that was slain. Rev. 5. 6 8 9 10 12.  1 Behold the glories of the Lamb Amidst his Father's throne Prepare new honours for his name, And songs before unknown.  2 Let elders worship at his feet, The church adore around, With vials full of odours sweet, And harps of sweeter sound.  3 Those are the prayers of the saints, And these the hymns they raise: Jesus is kind to our complaints, He loves to hear our praise.  4 [Eternal Father, who shall look Into thy secret will? Who but the Son shall take that book And open every seal?  5 He shall fulfil thy great decrees, The Son deserves it well; Lo, in his hand the sovereign keys Of heaven, and death, and hell!]  6 Now to the Lamb that once was slain Be endless blessings paid; Salvation, glory, joy remain For ever on thy head.  7 Thou hast redeem'd our souls with blood, Hast set the pris'ners free, Hast made us kings and priests to God, And we shall reign with thee.  8 The worlds of nature and of grace Are put beneath thy power; Then shorten these delaying days, And bring the promis'd hour.   Hymn 1:2. The deity and humanity of Christ, John 1. 1-3 14. Col. 9. 16. Eph. 3, 9 10.  1 Ere the blue heavens were stretch'd abroad, From everlasting was the Word; With God he was; the Word was God, And must divinely be ador'd.  2 By his own power were all things made; By him supported all things stand; He is the whole creation's head, And angels fly at his command.  3 Ere sin was born, or Satan fell, He led the host of morning stars; (Thy generation who can tell, Or count the number of thy years?)  4 But lo, he leaves those heavenly forms, The Word descends and dwells in clay, That he may hold converse with worms, Dress'd in such feeble flesh as they.  5 Mortals with joy beheld his face, Th' eternal Father's only Son; How full of truth! how full of grace! When thro' his eyes the Godhead shone!  6 Archangels leave their high abode To learn new mysteries here, and tell The loves of our descending God, The glories of Imannuel.   Hymn 1:3. The nativity of Christ, Luke 1. 30 &c. Luke 2, 10 &c.  1 Behold, the grace appears, The promise is fulfill'd; Mary the wondrous virgin bears, And Jesus is the child.  2 [The Lord, the highest God, Calls him his only Son; He bids him rule the lands abroad, And gives, him David's throne.  3 O'er Jacob shall he reign With a peculiar sway; The nations shall his grace obtain, His kingdom ne'er decay.]  4 To bring the glorious news A heavenly form appears; He tells the shepherds of their joys, And banishes their fears.  5 \"Go, humble swains,\" said he, \"To David's city fly; \"The promis'd infant born to-day, \"Doth in a manger lie.  6 \"With looks and heart serene, \"Go visit Christ your King;\" And straight, a flaming troop was seen; The shepherds heard them sing:  7 \"Glory to God on high, \"And heavenly peace on earth, \"Good-will to men, to angels joy, \"At the Redeemer's birth!\"  8 [In worship so divine Let saints employ their tongues, With the celestial host we join, And loud repeat their songs:  9 \"Glory to God on high, \"And heavenly peace on earth, \"Good-will to men, to angels joy, \"At our Redeemer's Birth.\"]   Hymn 1:4. [Supplement] The inward witness to Christianity, 1 John 5. 10.  1 Questions and doubts be heard no more; Let Christ and joy be all our theme; His Spirit seals his gospel sure, To every soul that trusts in him.  2 Jesus, thy witness speaks within: The mercy which thy words reveal Refines the heart from sense and sin, And stamps its own celestial seal.  3 'Tis God's inimitable hand That moulds and forms the heart anew; Blasphemers can no more withstand, But bow and own thy doctrine true.  4 The guilty wretch that trusts thy blood, Finds peace and pardon at thy cross; The sinful soul averse to God, Believes and loves his Maker's laws.  5 Learning and wit may cease their strife, When miracles with glory shine; The voice that calls the dead to life Must be almighty, and divine.   Hymn 1:5. Submission to afflictive providences, Job 1. 21.  1 Naked as from the earth we came, And crept to life at first, We to the earth return again, And mingle with our dust.  2 The dear delights we here enjoy, And fondly call our own, Are but short favours borrow'd now, To be repaid anon.  3 'Tis God that lifts our comforts high, Or sinks them in the grave; He gives, and (blessed be his name!) He takes but what he gave.  4 Peace, all our angry passions, then, Let each rebellious sigh Be silent at his sov'reign will, And every murmur die.  5 If smiling mercy crown our lives, Its praises shall be spread; And we'll adore the justice too That strikes our comforts dead.   Hymn 1:6. Triumph over death, Job 19. 25-27.  1 Great God, I own thy sentence just And nature must decay; I yield my body to the dust To dwell with fellow-clay.  2 Yet faith may triumph o'er the grave, And trample on the tombs: My Jesus, my Redeemer lives, My God, my Saviour comes.  3 The mighty Conqueror shall appear High on a royal seat, And Death, the last of all his foes, Lie vanquish'd at his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],["title","Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#1)"],["body","eet.  4 Tho' greedy worms devour my skin, And gnaw my wasting flesh, When God shall build my bones again, He clothes them all afresh.  5 Then shall I see thy lovely face With strong immortal eyes, And feast upon thy unknown grace With pleasure and surprise.   Hymn 1:7. The invitation of the gospel; or, Spiritual food and clothing, Isa. 55. 1 &c.  1 Let every mortal ear attend, And every heart rejoice, The trumpet of the gospel sounds With an inviting voice.  2 Ho, all ye hungry starving souls, That feed upon the wind, And vainly strive with earthly toys To fill an empty mind,  3 Eternal wisdom has prepar'd A soul reviving feast, And bids your longing appetites The rich provision taste.  4 Ho, ye that pant for living streams, And pine away and die, Here you may quench your raging thirst With springs that never dry.  5 Rivers of love and mercy here In a rich ocean join; Salvation in abundance flows, Like floods of milk and wine.  6 [Ye perishing and naked poor, Who work with mighty pain To weave a garment of your own That will not hide your sin,  7 Come naked, and adorn your souls In robes prepar'd by God, Wrought by the labours of his Son, And dy'd in his own blood.]  8 Dear God, the treasures of thy love Are everlasting mines, Deep as our helpless miseries are, And boundless as our sins.  9 The happy gates of gospel grace Stand open night and day, Lord, we are come to seek supplies, And drive our wants away.   Hymn 1:8. The safety and protection of the church, Isa. 26. 1-6.  1 How honourable is the place Where we adoring stand, Zion the glory of the earth, And beauty of the land!  2 Bulwarks of mighty grace defend The city where we dwell, The walls of strong salvation made, Defy th' assaults of hell.  3 Lift up the everlasting gates, The doors wide open fling, Enter, ye nations, that obey The statutes of our King.  4 Here you shall taste unmingled joys, And live in perfect peace, You that have known Jehovah's name, And ventur'd on his grace.  5 Trust in the Lord, for ever trust, And banish all your fears; Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells, Eternal as his years.  6 [What tho' the rebels dwell on high, His arm shall bring them low, Low' as the caverns of the grave Their lofty heads shall bow.]  7 [On Babylon our feet shall tread In that rejoicing hour, The ruins of her walls shall spread A pavement for the poor.]   Hymn 1:9. The promises of the covenant of grace, Isa. 55. 1 2. Zech. 13. 1. Mich. 7. 19. Ezek. 36. 25 &c.  1 In vain we lavish out our lives To gather empty wind, The choicest blessings earth can yield Will starve a hungry mind.  2 Come and the Lord shall feed our souls With more substantial meat, With such as saints in glory love, With such as angels eat.  3 Our God will every want supply, And fill our hearts with peace; He gives by covenant and by oath The riches of his grace.  4 Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls, And wash away our stains, In the dear fountain that his Son Pour'd from his dying veins.  5 [Our guilt shall vanish all away Tho' black as hell before; Our sins shall sink beneath the sea, And shall be found no more.  6 And lest pollution should o'erspread Our inward powers again, His Spirit shall bedew our souls Like purifying rain.]  7 Our heart, that flinty stubborn thing, That terrors cannot move, That fears no threat'nings of his wrath, Shall be dissolv'd by love;  8 Or he can take the flint away That would not be refin'd, And from the treasures of his grace Bestow a softer mind.  9 There shall his sacred Spirit dwell, And deep engrave his law, And every motion of our souls To swift obedience draw.  10 Thus will he pour salvation down, And we shall render praise, We the dear people of his love, And he our God of grace.   Hymn 1:10. The blessedness of gospel times; or, The revelation of Christ to Jews and Gentiles, Isa. 5. 2 7-10. Matt. 13. 16 17.  1 How beauteous are their feet Who stand on Zion's hill! Who bring salvation on their tongues, And words of peace reveal!  2 How charming is their voice! How sweet the tidings are! \"Zion, behold thy Saviour King, He reigns and triumphs here.\"  3 How happy are our ears That hear this joyful sound, Which kings and prophets waited for, And sought, but never found!  4 How blessed are our eyes That see this heavenly light! Prophets and kings desir'd it long, But dy'd without the sight.  5 The watchmen join their voice, And tuneful notes employ; Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, And deserts leant the joy.  6 The Lord makes bare his arm Thro' all the earth abroad Let every nation now behold Their Saviour and their God.   Hymn 1:11. The humble enlightened, and carnal reason humbled; or, The sovereignty of grace, Luke 10. 21 22  1 There was an hour when Christ rejoic'd, And spoke his joy in words of praise; \"Father, I thank thee, mighty God, \"Lord of the earth, and heavens, and seas.  2 \"I thank thy sovereign power and love, \"That crowns my doctrine with success; \"And makes the babes in knowledge learn \"The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace.  3 \"But all this glory lies conceal'd \"From men of prudence and of wit; \"The prince of darkness blinds their eyes, \"And their own pride resists the light.  4 \"Father, 'tis thus, because thy will \"Chose and ordain'd it should be so; \"T'is thy delight t' abase the proud, \"And lay the haughty scorner low.  5 \"There's none can know the Father right \"But those who learn it from the Son; \"Nor can the Son be well receiv'd, But where the Father makes him known.\"  6 Then let our souls adore our God That deals his graces as he please, Nor gives to mortals an account Or of his actions, or decrees.   Hymn 1:12. Free grace in revealing Christ, Luke 10. 21.  1 Jesus, the man of constant grief, A mourner all his days; His spirit once rejoic'd aloud, And tun'd his joy to praise.  2 \"Father, I thank thy wondrous love, \"That hath reveal'd thy Son \"To men unlearned; and to babes \"Has made thy gospel known.  3 \"The mysteries of redeeming grace \"Are hidden from the wise, \"While pride and carnal reasonings join \"To swell and blind their eyes.\"  4 Thus doth the Lord of heaven and earth His great decrees fulfil, And orders all his works of grace By his own sovereign will.   Hymn 1:13. The Son of God incarnate; or, The titles and the kingdom of Christ, Isa. 9. 2 6 7.  1 The lands that long in darkness lay Now have beheld a heavenly light; Nations that sat in death's cold shade Are bless'd with beams divinely bright.  2 The virgin's promis'd Son is born, Behold th' expected Child appear; What shall his names or titles be? The Wonderful, the Counsellor.  3 This infant is the mighty God Come to be suckled and ador'd Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace, The son of David, and his Lord.  4 The government of earth and seas Upon his shoulders shall be laid His wide dominions still increase, And honours to his name be paid.  5 Jesus the holy child shall sit High on his father David's throne, Shall crush his foes beneath his feet, And reign to ages yet unknown.   Hymn 1:14. The triumph of faith; or, Christ's unchangeable love, Rom. 8. 33 &c.  1 Who shall the Lord's elect condemn? 'Tis God that justifies their souls, And mercy like a mighty stream O'er all their sins divinely rolls.   2 Who shall adjudge the saints to hell? 'Tis Christ that suffer'd in their stead, And the salvation to fulfil, Behold him rising from the dead.  3 He lives, he lives, and sits above, For ever interceding there: Who shall divide us from his love? Or what should tempt us to despair?  4 Shall persecution, or distress, Famine, or sword, or nakedness? He that hath lov'd us bears us thro', And makes us more than conquerors too.  5 Faith hath an overcoming power, It triumphs in the dying hour; Christ is our life, our joy, our hope, Nor can we sink with such a prop.  6 Not all that men on earth can do, Nor powers on high, nor powers below, Shall cause his mercy to remove, Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.   Hymn 1:15. Our own weakness, and Christ our strength, 2 Cor. 12. 7 9 10.  1 Let me but hear my Saviour say, \"Strength shall be equal to thy day,\" Then I rejoice in deep distress, Leaning on all-sufficient Grace.  2 I glory in infirmity, That Christ's own power may rest on me; When I am weak, then am I strong, Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.  3 I can do all things, or can bear All sufferings, if my Lord be there; Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains, While his left hand my head sustains.  4 But if the Lord be once withdrawn, And we attempt the work alone, When new temptations spring and rise We find how great our weakness is.  5 [So Samson, when his hair was lost, Met the Philistines to his cost; Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise, Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.]   Hymn 1:16. Hosanna to Christ, Matt. 21. 9. Luke 19. 38 40.  1 Hosanna to the royal Son Of David's ancient line, His natures two, his person one, Mysterious and divine.  2 The root of David here we find, And offspring is the same; Eternity and time are join'd In our Immanuel's name.  3 Bless'd he that comes to wretched men With peaceful news from heaven; Hosannas of the highest strain To Christ the Lord be given.  4 Let mortals ne'er refuse to take Th' hosanna on their tongues, Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break Their silence into songs.   Hymn 1:17. Victory over death, 1 Cor. 15, 55 &c.  1 O for an overcoming faith To cheer my dying hours, To triumph o'er the monster Death, And all his frightful powers.  2 Joyful with all the strength I have My quivering lips should sing, \"Where is thy boasted victory, Grave? And where the monster's sting?\"  3 If sin be pardon'd I'm secure, Death hath no sting beside; The law gives sin its damning power, But Christ, my ransom, died.  4 Now to the God of victory Immortal thanks be paid, Who makes us conquerors while we die, Thro' Christ our living head.   Hymn 1:18. Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev. 14. 13.  1 Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims, For all the pious dead, Sweet is the savour of their names,"]]]
