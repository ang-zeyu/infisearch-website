We should, indeed, expect this     from the fact that the skin reflexes have already appeared before     birth, while a pleasurable sensitiveness of the lips is doubtless     a factor in the child's response to the contact of the maternal     nipple. Very early memories of sensory pleasure seem to be     frequently, perhaps most frequently, tactile in character, though     this fact is often disguised in recollection, owing to tactile     impression being vague and diffused; there is thus in Elizabeth     Potwin's \"Study of Early Memories\" (_Psychological Review_,     November, 1901) no separate group of tactile memories, and the     more elaborate investigation by Colegrove (\"Individual Memories,\"     _American Journal of Psychology_, January, 1899) yields no     decisive results under this head. See, however, Stanley Hall's     valuable study, \"Some Aspects of the Early Sense of Self,\"     _American Journal of Psychology_, April, 1898. Külpe has a     discussion of the psychology of cutaneous sensations (_Outlines     of Psychology_ [English translation], pp. 87 et seq.)      Harriet Martineau, at the beginning of her _Autobiography_,     referring to the vivid character of tactile sensations in early     childhood, remarks, concerning an early memory of touching a     velvet button, that \"the rapture of the sensation was really     monstrous.\" And a lady tells me that one of her earliest memories     at the age of 3 is of the exquisite sensation of the casual     contact of a cool stone with the vulva in the act of urinating.     Such sensations, of course, cannot be termed specifically sexual,     though they help to furnish the tactile basis on which the     specifically sexual sensations develop.      The elementary sensitiveness of the skin is shown by the fact     that moderate excitation suffices to raise the temperature, while     Heidenhain and others have shown that in animals cutaneous     stimuli modify the sensibility of the brain cortex, slight     stimulus increasing excitability and strong stimulus diminishing     it. Féré has shown that the slight stimulus to the skin furnished     by placing a piece of metal on the arm or elsewhere suffices to     increase the output of work with the ergograph. (Féré, _Comptes     Rendus Société de Biologie_, July 12, 1902; id., _Pathologic des     Emotions_, pp. 40 et seq.)      Féré found that the application of a mustard plaster to the skin,     or an icebag, or a hot-water bottle, or even a light touch with a     painter's brush, all exerted a powerful effect in increasing     muscular work with the ergograph. \"The tonic effect of cutaneous     excitation,\" he remarks, \"throws light on the psychology of the     caress. It is always the most sensitive parts of the body which     seek to give or to receive caresses. Many animals rub or lick     each other. The mucous surfaces share in this irritability of the     skin. The kiss is not only an expression of feeling; it is a     means of provoking it. Cataglottism is by no means confined to     pigeons. The tonic value of cutaneous stimulation is indeed a     commonly accepted idea. Wrestlers rub their hands or limbs, and     the hand-shake also is not without its physiological basis.      \"Cutaneous excitations may cause painful sensations to cease. Many     massage practices which favor work act chiefly as sensorial     stimulants; on this account many nervous persons cannot abandon     them, and the Greeks and Romans found in massage not only health,     but pleasure. Lauder Brunton regards many common manoeuvres, like     scratching the head and pulling the mustache, as methods of     dilating the bloodvessels of the brain by stimulating the facial     nerve. The motor reactions of cutaneous excitations favor this     hypothesis.\" (Féré, _Travail et Plaisir_, Chapter XV, \"Influence     des Excitations du Toucher sur le Travail.\")  The main characteristics of the primitive sense of touch are its wide diffusion over the whole body and the massive vagueness and imprecision of the messages it sends to the brain. This is the reason, why it is, of all the senses, the least intellectual and the least æsthetic; it is also the reason why it is, of all the senses, the most-profoundly emotional. \"Touch,\" wrote Bain in his _Emotions and Will_, \"is both the alpha and the omega of affection,\" and he insisted on the special significance in this connection of \"tenderness\"--a characteristic emotional quality of affection which is directly founded on sensations of touch. If tenderness is the alpha of affection, even between the sexes, its omega is to be found in the sexual embrace, which may be said to be a method of obtaining, through a specialized organization of the skin, the most exquisite and intense sensations of touch.      \"We believe nothing is so exciting to the instinct or mere     passions as the presence of the hand or those tactile caresses     which mark affection,\" states the anonymous author of an article     on \"Woman in her Psychological Relations,\" in the _Journal of     Psychological Medicine_, 1851. \"They are the most general stimuli     in lower animals. The first recourse in difficulty or danger, and     the primary solace in anguish, for woman is the bosom of her     husband or her lover. She seeks solace and protection and repose     on that part of the body where she herself places the objects of     her own affection. Woman appears to have the same instinctive     impulse in this respect all over the world.\"  It is because the sexual orgasm is founded on a special adaptation and intensification of touch sensations that the sense of touch generally is to be regarded as occupying the very first place in reference to the sexual emotions. Féré, Mantegazza, Penta, and most other writers on this question are here agreed. Touch sensations constitute a vast gamut for the expression of affection, with at one end the note of minimum personal affection in the brief and limited touch involved by the conventional hand-shake and the conventional kiss, and at the other end the final and intimate contact in which passion finds the supreme satisfaction of its most profound desire. The intermediate region has its great significance for us because it offers a field in which affection has its full scope, but in which every road may possibly lead to the goal of sexual love. It is the intimacy of touch contacts, their inevitable approach to the threshold of sexual emotion, which leads to a jealous and instinctive parsimony in the contact of skin and skin and to the tendency with the increased sensitiveness of the nervous system involved by civilization to restrain even the conventional touch manifestation of ordinary affection and esteem. In China fathers leave off kissing their daughters while they are still young children. In England the kiss as an ordinary greeting between men and women--a custom inherited from classic and early Christian antiquity--still persisted to the beginning of the eighteenth century. In France the same custom existed in the seventeenth century, but in the middle of that century was beginning to be regarded as dangerous,[2] while at the present time the conventional kiss on the cheek is strictly differentiated from the kiss on the mouth, which is reserved for lovers. Touch contacts between person and person, other than those limited and defined by custom, tend to become either unpleasant--as an undesired intrusion into an intimate sphere--or else, when occurring between man and woman at some peculiar moment, they may make a powerful reverberation in the emotional and more specifically sexual sphere. One man falls in love with his future wife because he has to carry her upstairs with a sprained ankle. Another dates his love-story from a romp in which his cheek accidentally came in contact with that of his future wife. A woman will sometimes instinctively strive to attract the attention of the man who appeals to her by a peculiar and prolonged pressure of the hand--the only touch contact permitted to her. Dante, as Penta has remarked, refers to \"sight or touch\" as the two channels through which a woman's love is revived (_Purgatorio_, VIII, 76). Even the hand-shake of a sympathetic man is enough in some chaste and sensitive women to produce sexual excitement or sometimes even the orgasm. The cases in which love arises from the influence of stimuli coming through the sense of touch are no doubt frequent, and they would be still more frequent if it were not that the very proximity of this sense to the sexual sphere causes it to be guarded with a care which in the case of the other senses it is impossible to exercise. This intimacy of touch and the reaction against its sexual approximations leads to what James has called \"the _antisexual instinct_, the instinct of personal isolation, the actual repulsiveness to us of the idea of intimate contact with most of the persons we meet, especially those of our own sex.\" He refers in this connection to the unpleasantness of the sensation felt on occupying a seat still warm from the body of another person.[3] The Catholic Church has always recognized the risks of vuluptuous emotion involved in tactile contacts, and the facility with which even the most innocent contacts may take on a libidinous character.[4]      The following observations were written by a lady (aged 30) who     has never had sexual relationships: \"I am only conscious of a     very sweet and pleasurable emotion when coming in contact with     honorable men, and consider that a comparison can be made between     the idealism of such emotions and those of music, of beauties of     Nature, and of productions of art. While studying and writing     articles upon a new subject I came in contact with a specialist,     who rendered me considerable aid, and, one day, while jointly     correcting a piece of work, he touched my hand. This produced a     sweet and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#3)"],["body","sensation of thrill through the whole system. I     said nothing; in fact, was too thrilled for speech; and never to     this day have shown any responsive action, but for months at     certain periods, generally twice a month, I have experienced the     most pleasurable emotions. I have seen this friend twice since,     and have a curious feeling that I stand on one side of a hedge,     while he is on the other, and, as neither makes an approach,     pleasure of the highest kind is experienced, but not allowed to     go beyond reasonable and health-giving bounds. In some moments I     feel overcome by a sense of mastery by this man, and yet, feeling     that any approach would be undignified, some pleasure is     experienced in restraining and keeping within proper bounds this     passional emotion. All these thrills of pleasurable emotion     possess a psychic value, and, so long as the nervous system is     kept in perfect health, they do not seem to have the power to     injure, but rather one is able to utilize the passionate emotions     as weapons for pleasure and work.\"      Various parts of the skin surface appear to have special sexual     sensitiveness, peculiarly marked in many individuals, especially     women; so that, as Féré remarks (_L'Instinct Sexuel_, second     edition, 1902, p. 130), contact stimulation of the lips, lobe of     ear, nape of neck, little finger, knee, etc., may suffice even to     produce the orgasm. Some sexually hyperæsthetic women, as has     already been noted, experience this when shaking hands with a man     who is attractive to them. In some neurotic persons this     sensibility, as Féré shows, may exist in so morbid a degree that     even the contact of the sensitive spot with unattractive persons     or inanimate objects may produce the orgasm. In this connection     reference may be made to the well-known fact that in some     hysterical subjects there are so-called \"erogenous zones\" simple     pressure on which suffices to evoke the complete orgasm. There     is, perhaps, some significance, from our present point of view,     in the fact that, as emphasized by Savill (\"Hysterical Skin     Symptoms,\" _Lancet_, January 30, 1904), the skin is one of the     very best places to study hysteria.      The intimate connection between the skin and the sexual sphere is     also shown in pathological conditions of the skin, especially in     acne as well as simple pimples on the face. The sexual     development of puberty involves a development of hair in various     regions of the body which previously were hairless. As, however,     the sebaceous glands on the face and elsewhere are the vestiges     of former hairs and survive from a period when the whole body was     hairy, they also tend to experience in an abortive manner this     same impulse. Thus, we may say that, with the development of the     sexual organs at puberty, there is correlated excitement of the     whole pilo-sebaceous apparatus. In the regions where this     apparatus is vestigial, and notably in the face, this abortive     attempt of the hair-follicles and their sebaceous appendages to     produce hairs tends only to disorganization, and simple     _comedones_ or pustular acne pimples are liable to occur. As a     rule, acne appears about puberty and dies out slowly during     adolescence. While fairly common in young women, it is usually     much less severe, but tends to be exacerbated at the menstrual     periods; it is also apt to appear at the change of life. (Stephen     Mackenzie, \"The Etiology and Treatment of Acne Vulgaris,\"     _British Medical Journal_, September 29, 1894. Laycock [_Nervous     Diseases of Women_, 1840, p. 23] pointed out that acne occurs     chiefly in those parts of the surface covered by sexual hair. A     lucid account of the origin of acne will be found in Woods     Hutchinson's _Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology_, pp.     179-184. G.J. Engelmann [\"The Hystero-neuroses,\" _Gynæcological     Transactions_, 1887, pp. 124 et seq.] discusses various     pathological disorders of the skin as reflex disturbances     originating in the sexual sphere.)      The influence of menstruation in exacerbating acne has been     called in question, but it seems to be well established. Thus,     Bulkley (\"Relation between Certain Diseases of the Skin and the     Menstrual Function,\" _Transactions of the Medical Society of New     York_, 1901, p. 328) found that, in 510 cases of acne in women,     145, or nearly one-third, were worse about the monthly period.     Sometimes it only appeared during menstruation. The exacerbation     occurred much more frequently just before than just after the     period. There was usually some disturbance of menstruation.     Various other disorders of the skin show a similar relationship     to menstruation.      It has been asserted that masturbation is a frequent or constant     cause of acne at puberty. (See, e.g., discussion in _British     Medical Journal_, July, 1882.) This cannot be accepted. Acne very     frequently occurs without masturbation, and masturbation is very     frequently practiced without producing acne. At the same time we     may well believe that at the period of puberty, when the     pilo-sebaceous system is already in sensitive touch with the     sexual system, the shock of frequently repeated masturbation may     (in the same way as disordered menstruation) have its     repercussion on the skin. Thus, a lady has informed me that at     about the age of 18 she found that frequently repeated     masturbation was followed by the appearance of _comedones_.   FOOTNOTES:  [2] A.

Ticklishness--Its Origin and Significance--The Psychology of Tickling--Laughter--Laughter as a Kind of Detumescence--The Sexual Relationships of Itching--The Pleasure of Tickling--Its Decrease with Age and Sexual Activity.   Touch, as has already been remarked, is the least intellectual of the senses. There is, however, one form of touch sensation--that is to say, ticklishness--which is of so special and peculiar a nature that it has sometimes been put aside in a class apart from all other touch sensations. Scaliger proposed to class titillation as a sixth, or separate, sense. Alrutz, of Upsala, regards tickling as a milder degree of itching, and considers that the two together constitute a sensation of distinct quality with distinct end-organs, for the mediation of that quality.[5] However we may regard this extreme view, tickling is certainly a specialized modification of touch and it is at the same time the most intellectual mode of touch sensation and that with the closest connection with the sexual sphere. To regard tickling as an intellectual manifestation may cause surprise, more especially when it is remembered that ticklishness is a form of sensation which reaches full development very early in life, and it has to be admitted that, as compared even with the messages that may be sent through smell and taste, the intellectual element in ticklishness remains small. But its presence here has been independently recognized by various investigators. Groos points out the psychic factor in tickling as evidenced by the impossibility of self-tickling.[6] Louis Robinson considers that ticklishness \"appears to be one of the simplest developments of mechanical and automatic nervous processes in the direction of the complex functioning of the higher centres which comes within the scope of psychology,\"[7] Stanley Hall and Allin remark that \"these minimal touch excitations represent the very oldest stratum of psychic life in the soul.\"[8] Hirman Stanley, in a somewhat similar manner, pushes the intellectual element in ticklishness very far back and associates it with \"tentacular experience.\" \"By temporary self-extension,\" he remarks, \"even low amoeboid organisms have slight, but suggestive, touch experiences that stimulate very general and violent reactions, and in higher organisms extended touch-organs, as tentacles, antennæ, hair, etc., become permanent and very delicately sensitive organs, where minimal contacts have very distinct and powerful reactions.\" Thus ticklishness would be the survival of long passed ancestral tentacular experience, which, originally a stimulation producing intense agitation and alarm, has now become merely a play activity and a source of keen pleasure.[9]  We need not, however, go so far back in the zoölogical series to explain the origin and significance of tickling in the human species. Sir J.Y. Simpson suggested, in an elaborate study of the position of the child in the womb, that the extreme excitomotory sensibility of the skin in various regions, such as the sole of the foot, the knee, the sides, which already exists before birth, has for its object the excitation and preservation of the muscular movements necessary to keep the foetus in the most favorable position in the womb.[10] It is, in fact, certainly the case that the stimulation of all the ticklish regions in the body tends to produce exactly that curled up position of extreme muscular flexion and general ovoid shape which is the normal position of the foetus in the womb. We may well believe that in this early developed reflex activity we have the basis of that somewhat more complex ticklishness which appears somewhat later.  The mental element in tickling is indicated by the fact that even a child, in whom ticklishness is highly developed, cannot tickle himself; so that tickling is not a simple reflex. This fact was long ago pointed out by Erasmus Darwin, and he accounted for it by supposing that voluntary exertion diminishes the energy of sensation.[11] This explanation is, however, inadmissible, for, although we cannot easily tickle"]]]
