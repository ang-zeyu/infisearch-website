TO THE REVEREND CLERGY:--  The undersigned proposes to commence another Periodical, of original plan and character, provided that adequate pledges of supplies shall be furnished. The Work to bear the following title, or something similar, viz.:  =THE AMERICAN PASTOR'S JOURNAL:=  OR  _Original Sketches of real Characters, Conversations, and striking Facts. Furnished chiefly by Clergymen._  The following imperfect sketch of topics to be embraced, may serve to illustrate the plan:--1. Instances of very early piety.--2. Striking results of Parental faithfulness, or unfaithfulness; of filial respect, or disrespect.--3. Cases of individuals raised from deep obscurity, or wickedness, to eminent usefulness.--4. Remarkable cases of conviction.--5. Cases of great hardness of heart, from resisting convictions.--6. Distinctly marked cases of submission and conversion to God.--7. Cases of awful relapse into sin.--8. Cases of strong temptation and trial.--9. Cases of strong faith and confidence in God.--10. Peculiarly manifest interpositions of Providence, in mercy or judgment.--11. Instances of the wrath of man being made to praise God.--12. Cases illustrative of the influence of piety on the intellectual powers.--13. Instances of extraordinary beneficence or covetousness.--14. Death-bed scenes, of the Christian, the backslider, the infidel, the universalist, the profane man, or the worldling.  It is conceived that the very existence of such a Periodical might be the means of leading Clergymen, in their pastoral intercourse, to be more observant of character, more discriminating in their views of human nature, and more disposed to record and rescue from oblivion striking conversations and facts. No species of knowledge can be more interesting or more useful, than that thus drawn from real life;--especially from portions of life most intimately connected with spiritual and eternal realities. If it is all-important that masters in surgery and medicine record, for mutual improvement, and for the benefit of mankind, striking cases which occur in their practice; it cannot, surely, be less important, that those who watch for the life of souls, should preserve similar records. It would seem as though, from the daily intercourse of several thousand Clergymen, such materials, of the character contemplated, might be furnished, as, if well condensed and judiciously arranged in an elegant Periodical, would not fail to be read with intense and general interest. And who can tell, but that God, who is rich in wisdom, may thus employ the simplest means for collecting, condensing, and reflecting rays of sacred truth, in the form of practical results, which may carry conviction and saving instruction to uncounted millions--not merely in our own land, but in more populous countries, where the importance of experimental religion is not appreciated?  But, for rendering such a work pre-eminently useful, or even commencing it, there must be union of effort. As it is intended to consist wholly of original matter, and that of a specific character, such as no genius can originate, it is obvious that it cannot be commenced, without being furnished with numerous pledges of supplies. And it will be important to have a considerable number of communications on hand, at the commencement, as well as afterwards, that due regard may be had to order in the arrangement of subjects, and an interesting variety be presented in every Number.  It will not be necessary to publish the names of writers, nor of individuals alluded to in communications; though in many cases it may be desirable and expedient. But, in every case, the name of the writer, or some respectable reference for attesting the accuracy of statements, must be furnished to the Editor; as he must be responsible to the public for the correctness of whatever may appear in the work. He will moreover think it his duty to present Contributors a generous compensation.  MINISTERS, of different Christian denominations, willing to aid in executing the design, are affectionately requested _to write as soon as practicable_--either furnishing matter for publication, or stating definitely, _when and how much aid may be expected_. If the work is ably supported by the co-operation of Clergymen, the Editor does not hesitate to say, that he will at least circulate thousands and tens of thousands of copies gratuitously, and thus afford Contributors the best of all rewards--the opportunity of doing extensive good.  That the blessing of God Almighty may crown the enterprise, is the humble prayer of His servant,  AUSTIN DICKINSON.     =CONTRIBUTORS.=   Upwards of fifty Clergymen, of five Christian denominations, and belonging to sixteen different States, most of whom are well known to the public as Authors, have encouraged the Editor to expect from them Sermons for the Preacher.          *       *       *       *       *  =TO THE ENTERPRISING.=   Persons having expressed a disposition to circulate this Work, provided postage could be avoided; we would say to such, that for _ten_ or more Subscribers, _who pay at one time_ in advance, or on first receiving Numbers, a deduction from the price of One Dollar a year may be made, equal to the annual postage. And in such cases money may be forwarded without being post-paid. Experience shows, there is no mode of conveyance safer than the Mail.

CHARLESTON, S. CAROLINA.   THE PURE GOSPEL REJECTED BY THE PERISHING.  1 COR. I. 18.--_For the preaching of the cross is, to them that perish, foolishness_.  In the Christian revelation, there is an evident purpose of infinite wisdom, that in all the provisions for man's salvation, his moral agency should be left free and uncontrolled. Instead of accommodation to human prejudices, there is ample scope for captious objections. And if additional proof were needed, of the divine origin of the Bible, it would be found in this characteristic. Were it a system agreeable to the narrow views, in unison with the selfish feelings, and gratifying to the depraved taste of human nature, it would more resemble the fabrication of man, than the workmanship of God. But as the current of its doctrines is so entirely opposed to our natural inclinations, as to render a moral renovation indispensable to a perception of the glory of revealed truth; all such ground of skepticism is removed.  Thus the obscurities and difficulties of revelation are admirably adapted to exhibit human character, and constitute this state of existence a real probation. For if the light of truth came upon the mind with resistless energy, and the operations of the divine government were clearly disclosed; if the motives and designs of infinite wisdom were fully explained, and the realities of the spiritual world completely laid open to view; one principal aim of this dispensation would be frustrated. On the one hand, there would be no field for the exercise of faith and humble confidence on the part of Christians; and thus a precious test of their submission and obedience would be destroyed. On the other, there could not be a full disclosure of the true feelings of the unrenewed heart. Because, as all would be evident as the noon-day sun, there would remain no choice in the matter of embracing the truth--no means of evincing whether its reception were cordial or compulsory.  In this respect; there is displayed a matchless skill, as well as a gracious condescension, in adapting revelation to the actual character and condition of our race. While sufficient light is afforded to guide the sincere inquirer, there is an obscurity to perplex and offend the proud and self-confident. While the truth is accompanied by evidence abundantly satisfactory to every mind open to conviction, enough of mystery remains, to form an impassable barrier to those who are inclined to disbelieve the testimony of God. While to the eye of faith there appears a glorious system of wisdom and mercy, depraved reason and prejudice may discover little else than an assemblage of inconsistencies and absurdities.  It is not without design, then, that the great facts of revelation are made liable to misrepresentation; that its essential principles are arrayed against the pride of human wisdom; and that its blessed institutions are so obnoxious to abuse and opposition. Such a constitution of things is evidently intended to furnish a decisive criterion of human character--to exhibit, in striking contrast, the humble votaries of faith, who reverently bow to the authority of Scripture; and the adherents of a haughty, self-confident rationality, who will receive the testimony of God himself, no farther than it accords with their opinions and prejudices--and thus to elicit a fair and full manifestation of every man's real disposition and feelings.  Such, uniformly, has been the effect of the Bible, wherever its sacred contents have been made known. To all who have received it with penitence, humility, and confidence, as the infallible word of God, it has proved their pleasure and delight--their fountain of consolation--their guide to peace: while the self-righteous and unbelieving have transformed it into a subject of perplexity and disputation--_a cause of deeper guilt and more aggravated ruin_. The Gospel has appeared transcendently beautiful and glorious to all who have been savingly enlightened by the Holy Spirit--while, to the impenitent and skeptical, it seems obscure, irrational, and incomprehensible.

On these principles it is easy to perceive the real nature and causes of the insidious warfare, which is maintained, in various forms, against the essential doctrines of the Gospel. It is just an effusion of the malignity of the unsanctified heart. Its prevalence is an exact fulfilment of prophecy; and therefore an irrefragable proof of the truth and divine authority of that system which it is labouring to destroy. The emphatic declaration of the apostle, in the text, strikingly describes the state of feeling which now actually prevails, among many who enjoy all the external privileges of the Christian dispensation--_The preaching of the cross is, to them that perish, foolishness._  In illustration of this passage, it will be attempted, to explain the import of the phrase, _the preaching of the cross_--to enumerate some of the _instances_ and _causes_ of such preaching being accounted _foolishness_--and to describe the _fearful state and prospects_ of those who hold it in such low estimation.  The preaching of the cross is a plain and full announcement of all the essential truths of that system which provides pardon and salvation for the lost and guilty. The cross is the symbol of that amazing expedient of infinite wisdom and mercy, by which a treaty of reconciliation is offered to convicted traitors against Jehovah's government. Its exhibition therefore must require a developement of the principles, and a defence of the doctrines, peculiar to this gracious dispensation.  The grand fact, which constitutes the very essence and glory of the Gospel, and which it is the leading object of the Christian ministry to announce; is, that He, who took upon himself the form of a servant, and offered up the sacrifice of Calvary, is _God over all, blessed for ever_. This gives to the cross all its glory and efficacy. It is on the supreme Deity of Christ--on the expiation made for sin by the Maker and Sovereign of worlds--that the whole fabric of evangelical truth rests. On any other supposition, the sacrifice of the cross was a very ordinary affair. If the Saviour of sinners be not God--if he be a created being, of whatever grade,--where is the _mystery of Godliness?_--Where those unfathomable depths of divine love, _into which the angels desire to look_? If Christ be only a servant of God, however exalted, what was there, in his appearance on our world, to constitute a new era in heaven, and to fill its inhabitants with astonishment and ecstasy? Did the heavenly host descend in rapture, and cause the mountains of Judea to reecho with their acclamations, because a _dependent creature_ had _consented_ to do his Maker's will? Whence the ascription of _glory to God in the highest_, and why do the courts above resound with a new song of praise to God for his redeeming mercy, if this redemption was effected by the labours and sufferings of one inferior to the Deity? Was such a dispensation as that of Moses, designed simply to prepare the way for a messenger of God to declare his will, and to seal the testimony with his blood, as many good men have done, both before and since? Why did patriarchs and prophets foretell his coming, and celebrate his praises?--Why did the continual offering of divinely appointed sacrifices, for many centuries, typify his sufferings?--And why did nature shudder, and shroud herself in darkness, at the consummation of those sufferings? All these things are utterly inexplicable, on the supposition that Christ is a created dependent being.  But view him as _God manifest in the flesh_--view him as voluntarily laying aside his glory, and descending from the throne of infinite majesty, to assume the nature, and expiate the guilt of a ruined race;--and we are struck with the appropriateness of all the attending circumstances. The splendid ceremonials of the Jewish ritual, and the raptured songs of prophets and of angels were well employed to prepare the way for the visible manifestation of Deity among men. The annunciation of the divine nature of the Redeemer must, therefore, be an essential part of _the preaching of the cross_.  Equally indispensable is a decided testimony to that perfect _atonement for sin_, which was made by this great offering. Here is the only foundation of human hope. This was the grand object accomplished by the Saviour's sufferings. Thus was completely solved the mysterious problem, which all created intelligences had deemed inexplicable--how sin could be remitted, without infringing the rights and tarnishing the honour of the divine government--and how the guilty could be rescued from wrath, without a forfeiture of the divine veracity. Never indeed was the divine law so completely vindicated, or the claims of justice so awfully asserted, as when the Lawgiver offered himself as a ransom. And no other possible manifestation of the malignity and atrocity of sin, of the divine abhorrence of all iniquity, and, at the same time, of the exhaustless treasures of redeeming mercy, could equal that which was witnessed on Calvary. As, therefore, Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so is the cross to be held up now, by its heralds, to a perishing world. Its atoning sacrifice is to be proclaimed, and its purchased blessings offered to lost sinners, as their only hope--their only remedy.  Another important part of _the preaching of the cross_ consists in a full disclosure of _the entire depravity and helplessness of our fallen nature_. This doctrine lies at the foundation of Christianity. It is from the corruption of our race, the dominion of spiritual death, and the actual sentence of condemnation, that the necessity arises for so _great salvation_. If hope could have been afforded from any other source, if there had been any possibility of the sinner's expiating his own guilt, and restoring himself to the divine favour, the great Sacrifice would never have been offered. But until men are convinced of their apostacy and corruption, they will never be persuaded of the truth and necessity of the great atonement. And until they feel themselves justly condemned, and utterly helpless, they will never come as humble suppliants to a Saviour's feet.  The work of the _Holy Spirit, in enlightening and renewing the hearts of sinners_, and thus carrying on to their accomplishment the purposes of divine mercy, forms also an important portion of the message of the Gospel. It is the glorious achievement of the cross, to slay the enmity and subdue the stubbornness of the sinful heart: and the infinite blessing purchased by the Saviour's blood, is the gift of the Holy Spirit, to effectuate that transformation of character, that spiritual regeneration, without which salvation is utterly impossible. The preaching of the cross, therefore, must include an unwavering declaration, that _the working of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost_ are indispensable to salvation.  It is moreover essential to a faithful _preaching of the cross_, that _justification by faith in Christ_, should be distinctly declared as the only ground of a sinner's hope. That view of the Gospel which represents it as bestowing upon man a power of fulfilling God's holy law--or as so lowering its demands as to render his imperfect obedience acceptable--is most dishonourable to God, and ruinous to the souls of men. No such provisions are found in the treaty of reconciliation sent from Heaven. So far from abrogating, the Gospel exalts and honours the law. So far from diminishing its strictness, it adds emphasis to its claims, and fully meets its unmitigated requisitions. Most gloriously has Christ vindicated the divine justice, by receiving its avenging sword in his own bosom, as the Substitute, or surety for sinners; and most effectually has he provided for their salvation, by rendering the exercise of pardoning mercy consistent with the principles of the divine government, and by working out for them a perfect righteousness, which may render them just before God. By faith, the penitent sinner receives all these blessings--is rescued from wrath, delivered from the guilt and bondage of sin, and made a child of God, and an heir of eternal life. Thus the triumph of the cross is complete, the pride of human merit is humbled in the dust, and all the glory of the salvation of sinners is rendered to the riches of redeeming mercy.  In fine, _the preaching of the cross_ includes a faithful denunciation of _eternal misery_, as the inevitable doom of all who pass from this state of probation, unrenewed by the Spirit of grace, unwashed in the blood of the Lamb.  Such are the essential principles of that system of redemption, which engaged the counsels of heaven from eternity; and which was carried into effect, not like the work of creation, by a single word of the Son of God, but by his assuming human nature, enduring a long exile of toil and reproach, and humbling himself unto death, even the death of the cross.  With what gratitude, then, ought this Gospel to be received by the guilty, perishing creatures, for whose rescue from perdition it is designed. How should this display of divine compassion melt and captivate the hearts of those, whose sins have been thus expiated, and for whom an offer of free pardon and endless blessedness has been thus dearly purchased.  But _be astonished, O heavens, at this_--these tidings of salvation are received by many with chilling indifference--the sufferings of the cross are regarded with unconcern--the treaty of reconciliation, written in atoning blood, is by some contemptuously disregarded--by others repelled with determined opposition. These appalling facts display more of the malignity of sin, its blinding, deadening"]]]
