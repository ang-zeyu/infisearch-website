The next instant, I was scrambling desperately after him. The lawyer-Tartarin had vanished!     CHAPTER VII  THE TRAGEDY   The wall was masked on the other side by a dense growth of shrubbery, and struggling through this, I found myself on the gravelled path where I had seen Marjorie Vaughan. Before me, along this path, sped a shadow which I knew to be Godfrey, and I followed at top speed. At the end of a moment, I caught a flash of light among the trees, and knew that we were nearing the house; but I saw no sign of Swain.  We came to the stretch of open lawn, crossed it, and, guided by the light, found ourselves at the end of a short avenue of trees. At the other end, a stream of light poured from an open door, and against that light a running figure was silhouetted. Even as I saw it, it bounded through the open door and vanished.  \"It's Swain!\" gasped Godfrey; and then we, too, were at that open door.  For an instant, I thought the room was empty. Then, from behind the table in the centre, a demoniac, blood-stained figure rose into view, holding in its arms a white-robed woman. With a sort of nervous shock, I saw that the man was Swain, and the woman Marjorie Vaughan. A thrill of fear ran through me as I saw how her head fell backwards against his shoulder, how her arms hung limp....  Without so much as a glance in our direction, he laid her gently on a couch, fell to his knees beside it, and began to chafe her wrists.  It was Godfrey who mastered himself first, and who stepped forward to Swain's side.  \"Is she dead?\" he asked.  Swain shook his head impatiently, without looking up.  \"How is she hurt?\" Godfrey persisted, bending closer above the unconscious girl.  Swain shot him one red glance.  \"She's not hurt!\" he said, hoarsely. \"She has fainted--that's all. Go away.\"  But Godfrey did not go away. After one burning look at Swain's lowering face, he bent again above the still figure on the couch, and touched his fingers to the temples. What he saw or felt seemed to reassure him, for his voice was more composed when he spoke again.  \"I think you're right, Swain,\" he said. \"But we'd better call someone.\"  \"Call away!\" snarled Swain.  \"You mean there's no one here? Surely, her father ...\"  He stopped, for at the words Swain had burst into a hoarse laugh.  \"Her father!\" he cried. \"Oh, yes; he's here! Call him! He's over there!\"  He made a wild gesture toward a high-backed easy-chair beside the table, his eyes gleaming with an almost fiendish excitement; then the gleam faded, and he turned back to the girl.  Godfrey cast one astonished glance at him and strode to the chair. I saw his face quiver with sudden horror, I saw him catch at the table for support, and for an instant he stood staring down. Then he turned stiffly toward me and motioned me to approach.  In the chair a man sat huddled forward--a grey-haired man, clad in a white robe. His hands were gripping the chair-arms as though in agony. His head hung down almost upon his knees.  Silently Godfrey reached down and raised the head. And a cry of horror burst from both of us.  The face was purple with congested blood, the tongue swollen and horribly protruding, the eyes suffused and starting from their sockets. And then, at a motion from Godfrey's finger, I saw that about the neck a cord was tightly knotted. The man had been strangled.  Godfrey, after a breathless moment in which he made sure that the man was quite dead, let the head fall forward again. It turned me sick to see how low it sagged, how limp it hung. And I saw that the collar of the white robe was spotted with blood.  I do not know what was in Godfrey's mind, but, by a common impulse, we turned and looked at Swain. He was still on his knees beside the couch. Apparently he had forgotten our presence.  \"It's plain enough,\" said Godfrey, his voice thick with emotion. \"She came in and found the body. No wonder she screamed like that! But where are the servants? Where is everybody?\"  The same thought was in my own mind. The utter silence of the house, the fact that no one came, added, somehow, to the horror of the moment. Those wild screams must have echoed from cellar to garret--and yet no one came!  Godfrey made a rapid scrutiny of the room, which was evidently the library, with a double door opening upon the grounds and another opposite opening into the hall. On the wall beside the inner door, he found an electric button, and he pushed it for some moments, but there was no response. If it rang a bell, the bell was so far away that we could not hear it.  A heavy curtain hung across the doorway. Godfrey pulled it aside and peered into the hall beyond. The hall was dark and silent. With face decidedly grim, he took his torch from one pocket and his pistol from another.  \"Come along, Lester,\" he said. \"We've got to look into this. Have your torch ready--and your pistol. God knows what further horrors this house contains!\"  He pulled back the curtain, so that the hall was lighted to some extent from the open doorway, and then passed through, I after him. The hall was a broad one, running right through the centre of the house from front to rear. Godfrey proceeded cautiously and yet rapidly the whole length of it, flashing his torch into every room. They were all luxuriously furnished, but were empty of human occupants. From the kitchen, which closed the hall at the rear, a flight of stone steps led down into the basement, and Godfrey descended these with a steadiness I could not but admire. We found ourselves in a square, stone-flagged room, evidently used as a laundry. Two doors opened out of it, but both were secured with heavy padlocks.  \"Store-rooms or wine-cellars, perhaps,\" Godfrey ventured, mounted the stairs again to the kitchen, and returned to the room whence we had started.  Everything there was as we had left it. The dead man sat huddled forward in his chair; Swain was still on his knees beside the couch; the girl had not stirred. Godfrey went to the side of the couch, and, disregarding Swain's fierce glance, again placed his fingers lightly on the girl's left temple. Then he came back to me.  \"If she doesn't revive pretty soon,\" he said, \"we'll have to try heroic measures. But there must be somebody in the house. Let's look upstairs.\"  He led the way up the broad stairs, which rose midway of the hall, sending a long ray of light ahead of him. I followed in no very happy frame of mind, for I confess that this midnight exploration of an unknown house, with a murdered man for its only occupant, was getting on my nerves. But Godfrey proceeded calmly and systematically.  The hall above corresponded to that below, with two doors on each side, opening into bedroom suites. The first was probably that of the master of the house. It consisted of bedroom, bath and dressing-room, but there was no one there. The next was evidently Miss Vaughan's. It also had a bath and a daintily-furnished boudoir; but these, too, were empty.  Then, as we opened the door across the hall, a strange odour saluted us--an odour suggestive somehow of the East--which, in the first moment, caught the breath from the throat, and in the second seemed to muffle and retard the beating of the heart.  A flash of Godfrey's torch showed that we were in a little entry, closed at the farther end by a heavy drapery. Godfrey strode forward and swept the drapery aside. The rush of perfume was over-powering, and through the opening came a soft glow of light.  It was a moment before I got my breath; then a mist seemed to fall from before my eyes and a strange sense of exaltation and well-being stole through me. I saw Godfrey standing motionless, transfixed, with one hand holding back the drapery, and his torch hanging unused in the other, and I crept forward and peered over his shoulder at the strangest scene I have ever gazed upon.  Just in front of us, poised in the air some three feet from the floor, hung a sphere of crystal, glowing with a soft radiance which seemed to wax and wane, to quiver almost to darkness and then to burn more clearly. It was like a dreamer's pulse, fluttering, pausing, leaping, in accord with his vision. And as I gazed at the sphere, I fancied I could see within it strange, elusive shapes, which changed and merged and faded from moment to moment, and yet grew always clearer and more suggestive. I bent forward, straining my eyes to see them better, to fathom their meaning ...  Godfrey, turning to speak to me, saw my attitude and shook me roughly by the arm.  \"Don't do that, Lester!\" he growled in my ear. \"Take your eyes off that crystal!\"  I tried to move my eyes, but could not, until Godfrey pulled me around to face him. I stood blinking at him stupidly.  \"I was nearly gone, myself, before I realised the danger,\" he said. \"A sphere like that can hypnotise a man more quickly than anything else on earth, especially when his resistance is lessened, as it is by this heavy perfume.\"  \"It was rather pleasant,\" I said. \"I should like to try it some time.\"  \"Well, you can't try it now. You've got something else to do. Besides, it has two victims already.\"  \"Two victims?\"  \"Look carefully, but keep your eyes off the sphere,\" he said, and swung me around toward the room again.  The room was shrouded in impenetrable darkness, except for the faint and quivering radiance which the sphere emitted, and as I plunged my eyes into its depths in an effort to see what lay there, it seemed to me that I had never seen blackness so black. As I stared into it, with straining eyes, a vague form grew dimly visible beside the glowing sphere; and then I recoiled a little, for suddenly it took shape and I saw it was a man.  I had a queer fancy, as I stood there, that it was really a picture into which I was gazing--one of Rembrandt's--for, gradually, one detail after another emerged from the darkness, vague shadows "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13372"],["title","The Gloved Hand (#8)"],["body","on shape and meaning, but farther back there was always more shadow, and farther back still more ...  The man was sitting cross-legged on a low divan, his hands crossed in front of him and hanging limply between his knees. His clothing I could see but vaguely, for it was merged into the darkness about him, but his hands stood out white against it. He was staring straight at the crystal, with unwavering and unwinking gaze, and sat as motionless as though carved in stone. The glow from the sphere picked out his profile with a line of light--I could see the high forehead, the strong, curved nose, the full lips shaded by a faint moustache, and the long chin, only partially concealed by a close-clipped beard. It was a wonderful and compelling face, especially as I then saw it, and I gazed at it for a long moment.  \"It's the adept, I suppose,\" said Godfrey, no longer taking care to lower his voice.  It sounded unnaturally loud in the absolute stillness of the room, and I looked at the adept quickly, but he had not moved.  \"Can't he hear you?\" I asked.  \"No--he couldn't hear a clap of thunder. That is, unless he's faking.\"  I looked again at the impassive figure.  \"He's not faking,\" I said.  \"I don't know,\" and Godfrey shook his head sceptically. \"It looks like the real thing--but these fellows are mighty clever. Do you see the other victim? There's no fake about it!\"  \"I see no one else,\" I said, after a vain scrutiny.  \"Look carefully on the other side of the sphere. Don't you see something there?\"  My eyes were smarting under the strain, and for a moment longer I saw nothing; then a strange, grey shape detached itself from the blackness. It was an ugly and repulsive shape, slender below, but swelling hideously at the top, and as I stared at it, it seemed to me that it returned my stare with malignant eyes screened by a pair of white-rimmed glasses. Then, with a sensation of dizziness, I saw that the shape was swaying gently back and forth, in a sort of rhythm. And then, quite suddenly, I saw what it was, and a chill of horror quivered up my back.  It was a cobra.  To and fro it swung, to and fro, its staring eyes fixed upon the sphere, its spectacled hood hideously distended.  The very soul within me trembled as I gazed at those unwinking eyes. What did they see in the sphere? What was passing in that inscrutable brain? Could it, too, reconstruct the past, read the mysteries of the future ...  Some awful power, greater than my will, seemed stretching its tentacles from the darkness: I felt them dragging at me, certain, remorseless, growing stronger and stronger ...  With something very like a shriek of terror, I tore myself away, out of the entry, into the hall, to the stairs, and down them into the lighted room below.  And as I stood there, gasping for breath, Godfrey followed me, and I saw that his face, too, was livid.     CHAPTER VIII  A FRESH ENIGMA   Godfrey met my eyes with a little deprecating smile, put his torch in one pocket, took a handkerchief from another, and mopped his forehead.  \"Rather nerve-racking, wasn't it, Lester?\" he remarked, and then his gaze wandered to the couch, and he stepped toward it quickly.  I saw that a change had come in Miss Vaughan's condition. Her eyes were still closed, but her body no longer lay inert and lifeless, for from moment to moment it was shaken by a severe nervous tremor. Godfrey's face was very grave as he looked at her.  \"Stop stroking her wrists, Swain,\" he said; \"that does no good,\" and when Swain, without answering or seeming to hear, kept on stroking them, Godfrey drew the hands away, took Swain by the arm, and half-lifted him to his feet. \"Listen to me,\" he said, more sternly, and shook him a little, for Swain's eyes were dull and vacant. \"I want you to sit quietly in a chair for a while, till you get your senses back. Miss Vaughan is seriously ill and must not be disturbed in any way. I'm going to get a doctor and a nurse at once; they'll do what needs to be done. Until then, she must be left alone. Understand?\"  Swain nodded vaguely, and permitted Godfrey to lead him to a chair near the outer door, where he sat down. As his hand fell across the arm of the chair, I could see that a little blood was still oozing from the wound on the wrist. Godfrey saw it, too, and picked up the hand and looked at it. Then he laid it gently down again and glanced at his watch. I followed his example, and saw that it was half-past one.  \"Have you nerve enough to stay here half an hour by yourself, Lester?\" he asked.  \"By myself?\" I echoed, and glanced at the dead man and at the quivering girl.  \"I've got to run over to my place to get a few things and do some telephoning,\" he explained. \"We must get a doctor up here at once; and then there's the police--I'll try to get Simmonds. Will you stay?\"  \"Yes,\" I said, \"of course. But please get back as soon as you can.\"  \"I will,\" he promised, and, after a last look around the room, stepped out upon the walk.  I went to the door and looked after him until the sound of his footsteps died away. Then, feeling very lonely, I turned back into the room. Those regular tremors were still shaking the girl's body in a way that seemed to me most alarming, but there was nothing I could do for her, and I finally pulled a chair to Swain's side. He, at least, offered a sort of companionship. He was sitting with his head hanging forward in a way that reminded me most unpleasantly of the huddled figure by the table, and did not seem to be aware of my presence. I tried to draw him into talk, but a slight nod from time to time was all I could get from him, and I finally gave it up. Mechanically, my hand sought my coat pocket and got out my pipe--yes, that was what I needed; and, sitting down in the open doorway, I filled it and lighted up.  My nerves grew calmer, presently, and I was able to think connectedly of the events of the night, but there were two things which, looked at from any angle, I could not understand. One was Swain's dazed and incoherent manner; the other was the absence of servants.  As to Swain, I believed him to be a well-poised fellow, not easily upset, and certainly not subject to attacks of nerves. What had happened to him, then, to reduce him to the pitiable condition in which he had come back to us over the wall, and in which he was still plunged? The discovery of the murder and of Miss Vaughan's senseless body might have accounted for it, but his incoherence had antedated that--unless, indeed, he knew of the murder before he left the grounds. That thought gave me a sudden shock, and I put it away from me, not daring to pursue it farther.  As to the house, its deserted condition seemed sinister and threatening. It was absurd to suppose that an establishment such as this could be carried on without servants, or with less than three or four. But where were they? And then I remembered that Godfrey and I had not completed our exploration of the house. We had stopped at the gruesome room where the adept and his serpent gazed unwinking into the crystal sphere. There was at least one suite on the same floor we had not looked into, and no doubt there were other rooms on the attic floor above. But that any one could have slept on undisturbed by those piercing screams and by our own comings and goings seemed unbelievable. Perhaps there were separate quarters in the grounds somewhere--  And then, without conscious will of my own, I felt my body stiffen and my fingers grip my pipe convulsively. A slow tremor seemed to start from the end of my spine, travel up it, and pass off across my scalp. There was someone in the room behind me; someone with gleaming eyes fixed upon me; and I sat there rigidly, straining my ears, expecting I knew not what--a blow upon the head, a cord about the neck.  A rapid step came up the walk and Godfrey appeared suddenly out of the darkness.  \"Well, Lester,\" he began; but I sprang to my feet and faced the room, for I could have sworn that I had heard behind me the rustle of a silken dress. But there was no one there except Swain and Miss Vaughan and the dead man--and none of them had moved.  \"What is it?\" Godfrey asked, stepping past me into the room.  \"There was someone there, Godfrey,\" I said. \"I'm sure of it--I felt someone--I felt his eyes on me--and then, as you spoke, I heard the rustle of a dress.\"  \"Of a dress?\"  \"Or of a robe,\" and my thoughts were on the bearded man upstairs.  Godfrey glanced at me, crossed the room, and looked out into the hall. Then he turned back to me.  \"Well, whoever it was,\" he said, and I could see that he thought my ears had deceived me, \"he has made good his escape. There'll be a doctor and a nurse here in a few minutes, and I got Simmonds and told him to bring Goldberger along. He can't get here for an hour anyway. And I've got a change here for Swain,\" he added, with a gesture toward some garments he carried over one arm; \"also a bracer to be administered to him,\" and he drew a flask from his pocket and handed it to me. \"Maybe you need one, yourself,\" he added, smiling drily, \"since you've taken to hearing rustling robes.\"  \"I do,\" I said, \"though not on that account,\" and I raised the flask to my lips and took a long swallow.  \"Suppose you take Swain up to the bath-room,\" Godfrey suggested, \"and help him to get cleaned up. I'll go down to the gate and wait for the doctor.\"  \"The gate's probably locked.\"  \"I thought of that,\" and he drew a small but heavy hammer from his pocket. \"I'll smash the lock, if there's no other way. I'd like you to get Swain into shape before anyone arrives,\" he added. \"He's not a prepossessing object as he is.\"  \"No, he isn't,\" I agreed, looking at him, and I took the garments which Godfrey held out to me. Then I went over to Swain and put the flask into his uninjured hand. \"Take a drink of that,\" I said.  He did not understand at first; then he put the flask to his lips and drank eagerly--so eagerly that I had to draw it away. He watched me "]]]
