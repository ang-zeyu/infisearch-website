It is for me, for me, thou doest all that?... I hear thy heart beat as if it were mine.... Come hither ... nearer, nearer me....  MÉLISANDE.  Why do you laugh?  PÉLLÉAS.  I do not laugh;--or else I laugh for joy, unwittingly.... It were a weeping matter, rather....  MÉLISANDE.  We have come here before.... I recollect....  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes ... yes.... Long months ago.--I knew not then.... Knowest thou why I asked thee to come here to-night?  MÉLISANDE.  No.  PÉLLÉAS.  It is perhaps the last time I shall see thee.... I must go away forever....  MÉLISANDE.  Why sayest thou always thou wilt go away?...  PÉLLÉAS.  I must tell thee what thou knowest already?--Thou knowest not what I am going to tell thee?  MÉLISANDE.  Why, no; why, no; I know nothing--...  PÉLLÉAS.  Thou knowest not why I must go afar.... Thou knowest not it is because ... [_He kisses her abruptly._] I love thee....  MÉLISANDE (_in a low voice_).  I love thee too....  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh! oh! What saidst thou, Mélisande?... I hardly heard it!... Thou sayest that in a voice coming from the end of the world!... I hardly heard thee.... Thou lovest me?--Thou lovest me too?... Since when lovest thou me?...  MÉLISANDE.  Since always.... Since I saw thee....  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh, how thou sayest that!... Thy voice seems to have blown across the sea in spring!... I have never heard it until now;... one would say it had rained on my heart!... Thou sayest that so frankly!... Like an angel questioned!... I cannot believe it, Mélisande!... Why shouldst thou love me?--Nay, why dost thou love me?--Is what thou sayest true?--Thou dost not mock me?--Thou dost not lie a little, to make me smile?...  MÉLISANDE.  No; I never lie; I lie but to thy brother....  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh, how thou sayest that!... Thy voice! thy voice!... It is cooler and more frank than the water is!... It is like pure water on my lips!... It is like pure water on my hands.... Give me, give me thy hands!... Oh, how small thy hands are!... I did not know thou wert so beautiful!... I have never seen anything so beautiful before thee.... I was fall of unrest; I sought throughout the house.... I sought throughout the country.... And I found not beauty.... And now I have found thee!... I have found thee!.,. I do not think there could be on the earth a fairer woman!... Where art thou?--I no longer hear thee breathe....  MÉLISANDE.  Because I look on thee....  PÉLLÉAS.  Why dost thou look so gravely on me?--We are already in the shadow.--It is too dark under this tree. Come into the light. We cannot see how happy we are. Come, come; so little time remains to us....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; let us stay here.... I am nearer thee in the dark....  PÉLLÉAS.  Where are thine eyes?--Thou art not going to fly me?--Thou dost not think of me just now.  MÉLISANDE.  Oh, yes; oh, yes; I only think of thee....  PÉLLÉAS.  Thou wert looking elsewhere....  MÉLISANDE.  I saw thee elsewhere....  PÉLLÉAS.  Thy soul is far away.... What ails thee, then?--Meseems thou art not happy....  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes; I am happy, but I am sad....  PÉLLÉAS.  One is sad often when one loves....  MÉLISANDE.  I weep always when I think of thee....  PÉLLÉAS.  I too.... I too, Mélisande.... I am quite near thee; I weep for joy, and yet ...[_He kisses her again._]--Thou art strange when I kiss thee so.... Thou art so beautiful that one would think thou wert about to die....  MÉLISANDE.  Thou too....  PÉLLÉAS.  There, there.... We do not what we will.... I did not love thee the first time I saw thee....  MÉLISANDE.  Nor I ... nor I.... I was afraid....  PÉLLÉAS.  I could not admit thine eyes.... I would have gone away at once ... and then....  MÉLISANDE.  And I,--I would not have come.... I do not yet know why,--I was afraid to come....  PÉLLÉAS.  There are so many things one never knows. We are ever waiting; and then.... What is that noise?--They are closing the gates!...  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, they have closed the gates....  PÉLLÉAS.  We cannot go back now?--Hearest thou the bolts?--Listen! listen!... the great chains!... the great chains!... It is too late; it is too late!...  MÉLISANDE.  All the better! all the better! all the better!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Thou--...? Behold, behold!... It is no longer we who will it so!... All's lost, all's saved! all is saved to-night!--Come, come.... My heart beats like a madman,--up to my very throat.... [_They embrace._] Listen! listen! my heart is almost strangling me.... Come! come!... Ah, how beautiful it is in the shadows!...  MÉLISANDE.  There is some one behind us!...  PÉLLÉAS.  I see no one....  MÉLISANDE.  I heard a noise....  PÉLLÉAS.  I hear only thy heart in the dark....  MÉLISANDE.  I heard the crackling of dead leaves....  PÉLLÉAS.  Because the wind is silent all at once.... It fell as we were kissing....  MÉLISANDE.  How long our shadows are to-night!...  PÉLLÉAS.  They embrace to the very end of the garden. Oh, how they kiss far away from us!... Look! look!...  MÉLISANDE.(_a stifled voice_).  A-a-h!--He is behind a tree!  PÉLLÉAS.  Who?  MÉLISANDE.  Golaud!  PÉLLÉAS.  Golaud!--where?--I see nothing....  MÉLISANDE.  There ... at the end of our shadows.  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes, yes; I saw him.... Let us not turn abruptly....  MÉLISANDE.  He has his sword....  PÉLLÉAS.  I have not mine....  MÉLISANDE.  He saw us kiss....  PÉLLÉAS.  He does not know we have seen him.... Do not stir; do not turn your head.... He would rush headlong on us.... He will remain there while he thinks we do not know. He watches us.... He is still motionless.... Go, go at once this way.... I will wait for him.... I will stop him....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no, no!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Go! go! he has seen all!... He will kill us!...  MÉLISANDE.  All the better! all the better! all the better!...  PÉLLÉAS.  He comes! he comes!... Thy mouth!... Thy mouth!...  MÉLISANDE.  Yes!... yes! yes!...                                                   [_They kiss desperately._  PÉLLÉAS  Oh! oh! All the stars are falling!...  MÉLISANDE.  Upon me too! upon me too!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Again! Again!... Give! give!...  MÉLISANDE.  All! all! all!...      [Golaud rushes upon them, sword in hand, and strikes Pélléas, who     falls at the brink of the fountain. Mélisande flees terrified.]  MÉLISANDE. (_fleeing_).  Oh! oh! I have no courage I ... I have no courage!...                           [GOLAUD _pursues her through the wood in silence._     ACT FIFTH.     SCENE I.--_A lower hall in the castle. The women servants discovered, gathered together, while without children are playing before one of the ventilators of the hall._   AN OLD SERVANT.  You will see, you will see, my daughters; it will be to-night.--Some one will come to tell us by and by....  ANOTHER SERVANT.  They will not come to tell us.... They don't know what they are doing any longer....  THIRD SERVANT.  Let us wait here....  FOURTH SERVANT.  We shall know well enough when we must go up....  FIFTH SERVANT.  When the time is come, we shall go up of ourselves....  SIXTH SERVANT.  There is no longer a sound heard in the house....  SEVENTH SERVANT.  We ought to make the children keep still, who are playing before the ventilator.  EIGHTH SERVANT.  They will be still of themselves by and by.  NINTH SERVANT.  The time has not yet come....  _Enter an old Servant._  THE OLD SERVANT.  No one can go in the room any longer. I have listened more than an hour.... You could hear the flies walk on the doors.... I heard nothing....  FIRST SERVANT.  Has she been left alone in the room?  THE OLD SERVANT.  No, no; I think the room is full of people.  FIRST SERVANT.  They will come, they will come, by and by....  THE OLD SERVANT.  Lord! Lord! It is not happiness that has come into the house.... One may not speak, but if I could say what I know...  SECOND SERVANT.  It was you who found them before the gate?  THE OLD SERVANT.  Why, yes! why, yes! it was I who found them. The porter says it was he who saw them first; but it was I who waked them. He was sleeping on his face and would not get up.--And now he comes saying, \"It was I who saw them first.\" Is that just?--See, I burned myself lighting a lamp to go down cellar.--Now what was I going to do down cellar?--I can't remember any more what I was going to do down cellar.--At any rate I got up very early; it was not yet very light; I said to myself, I will go across the courtyard, and then I will open the gate. Good; I go down the stairs on tiptoe, and I open the gate as if it were an ordinary gate.... My God! My God! What do I see? Divine a little what I see!...  FIRST SERVANT.  They were before the gate?  THE OLD SERVANT.  They were both stretched out before the gate!... Exactly like poor folk that are too hungry.... They were huddled together like little children who are afraid.... The little princess was nearly dead, and the great Golaud had still his sword in his side.... There was blood on the sill....  SECOND SERVANT.  We ought to make the children keep still.... They are screaming with all their might before the ventilator....  THIRD SERVANT.  You can't hear yourself speak....  FOURTH SERVANT.  There is nothing to be done: I have tried already; they won't keep still....  FIRST SERVANT.  It seems he is nearly cured?  THE OLD SERVANT.  Who?  FIRST SERVANT.  The great Golaud.  THIRD SERVANT.  Yes, yes; they have taken him to his wife's room. I met them just now, in the corridor. They were holding him up as if he were drunk. He cannot yet walk alone.  THE OLD SERVANT.  He could not kill himself; he is too big. But she is hardly wounded, and it is she who is going to die.... Can you understand that?  FIRST SERVANT.  You have seen the wound?  THE OLD SERVANT.  As I see you, my daughter.--I saw everything, you understand.... I saw it before all the others.... A tiny little wound under her little left breast,--a little wound that wouldn't kill a pigeon. Is it natural?  FIRST SERVANT.  Yes, yes; there is something underneath....  SECOND SERVANT.

THE OLD SERVANT.  Exactly!... She was delivered on her death-bed; is that a little sign?--And what a child! Have you seen it?--A wee little girl a beggar would not bring into the world.... A little wax figure that came much too soon;... a little wax figure that must live in lambs' wool.... Yes, yes; it is not happiness that has come into the house....  FIRST SERVANT.  Yes, yes; it Is the hand of God that has been stirring....  SECOND SERVANT.  Yes, yes; all that did not happen without reason....  THIRD SERVANT.  It is as good lord Pélléas ... where is he?--No one knows....  THE OLD SERVANT.  Yes, yes; everybody knows.... But nobody dare speak of it.... One does not speak of this;... one does not speak of that;... one speaks no more of anything;... one no longer speaks truth.... But _I_ know he was found at the bottom of Blind Man's Spring;... but no one, no one could see him.... Well, well, we shall only know all that at the last day....  FIRST SERVANT.  I dare not sleep here any longer....  THE OLD SERVANT.  Yes, yes; once ill-fortune is in the house, one keeps silence in vain....  THIRD SERVANT.  Yes; it finds you all the same....

[_Exeunt in silence._     SCENE II.--_An apartment in the castle._   ARKËL, GOLAUD, _and the_ PHYSICIAN _discovered in one corner of the room._ MÉLISANDE _is stretched upon her bed._  THE PHYSICIAN.  It cannot be of that little wound she is dying; a bird would not have died of it.... It is not you, then, who have killed her, good my lord; do not be so disconsolate.... She could not have lived.... She was born without reason ... to die; and she dies without reason.... And then, it is not sure we shall not save her....  ARKËL.  No, no; it seems to me we keep too silent, in spite of ourselves, in her room.... It is not a good sign.... Look how she sleeps ... slowly, slowly;... it is as if her soul was cold forever....  GOLAUD.  I have killed her without cause! I have killed her without cause!... Is it not enough to make the stones weep?... They had kissed like little children.... They had simply kissed.... They were brother and sister.... And I, and I at once!... I did it in spite of myself, look you.... I did it in spite of myself....  THE PHYSICIAN.  Stop; I think she is waking....  MÉLISANDE.  Open the window;... open the window....  ARKËL  Shall I open this one, Mélisande?  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; the great window ... the great window.... It is to see....  ARKËL.  Is not the sea air too cold to-night? Do it; do it....  MÉLISANDE.  Thanks.... Is it sunset?  ARKËL.  Yes; it is sunset on the sea; it is late.--How are you, Mélisande?  MÉLISANDE.  Well, well.--Why do you ask that? I have never been better.--And yet it seems to me I know something....  ARKËL.  What sayest thou?--I do not understand thee....  MÉLISANDE.  Neither do I understand all I say, you see.... I do not know what I am saying.... I do not know what I know.... I no longer say what I would....  ARKËL.  Why, yes! why, yes!... I am quite happy to hear thee speak so; thou hast raved a little these last days, and one no longer understood thee.... But now all that is far away....  MÉLISANDE.  I do not know....--Are you all alone in the room, grandfather?  ARKËL.  No; there is the physician, besides, who cured thee....  MÉLISANDE.  Ah!...  ARKËL.  And then there is still some one else....  MÉLISANDE.  Who is it?  ARKËL.  It is ... thou must not be frightened.... He does not wish thee the least harm, be sure.... If thou'rt afraid, he will go away.... He is very unhappy....  MÉLISANDE.  Who is it?  ARKËL.  It is thy ... thy husband.... It is Golaud....  MÉLISANDE.  Golaud is here? Why does he not come by me?  GOLAUD (_dragging himself toward the bed._)  Mélisande ... Mélisande....  MÉLISANDE.  Is it you, Golaud? I should hardly recognize you any more.... It is the evening sunlight in my eyes.... Why look you on the walls? You have grown thin and old.... Is it a long while since we saw each other?  GOLAUD (_to_ ARKËL _and the_ PHYSICIAN).  Will you withdraw a moment, if you please, if you please?... I will leave the door wide open.... One moment only.... I would say something to her; else I could not die.... Will you?--Go clear to the end of the corridor; you can come back at once, at once.... Do not refuse me this.... I am a wretch.... [_Exit_ ARKËL _and the_ PHYSICIAN.]--Mélisande, hast thou pity on me, as I have pity on thee?... Mélisande?... Dost thou forgive me, Mélisande?...  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes, I do forgive thee.... What must I forgive?...  GOLAUD.  I have wrought thee so much ill, Mélisande.... I cannot tell thee the ill I have wrought thee.... But I see it, I see it so clearly to-day ... since the first day.... And all I did not know till now leaps in my eyes to-night.... And it is all my fault, all that has happened, all that will happen.... If I could tell it, thou wouldst see as I do!... I see all! I see all!... But I loved thee so!... I loved thee so!... But now there is some one dying.... It is I who am dying.... And I would know.... I would ask thee.... Thou'lt bear me no ill-will.... I would.... The truth must be told to a dying man.... He must know the truth, or else he could not sleep.... Swearest thou to tell me the truth?  MÉLISANDE  Yes.  GOLAUD.  Didst thou love Pélléas?  MÉLISANDE.  Why, yes; I loved him.--Where is he?  GOLAUD.  Thou dost not understand me?--Thou wilt not understand me?--It seems to me ... it seems to me.... Well, then, here: I ask thee if thou lovedst him with a forbidden love?... Wert thou ... were you guilty? Say, say, yes, yes, yes!...  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; we were not guilty.--Why do you ask that?  GOLAUD.  Mélisande!... tell me the truth, for the love of God!  MÉLISANDE.  Why have I not told the truth?  GOLAUD.  Do not lie so any more, at the moment of death!  MÉLISANDE.  Who is dying?--Is it I?  GOLAUD.  Thou, thou! and I, I too, after thee!... And we must have the truth.... We must have the truth at last, dost thou understand?... Tell me all! Tell me all! I forgive thee all!...  MÉLISANDE.  Why am I going to die?--I did not know it....  GOLAUD.  Thou knowest it now!... It is time! It is time!... Quick! quick!... The truth! the truth!...  MÉLISANDE.  The truth ... the truth....  GOLAUD.  Where art thou?--Mélisande!--Where art thou?--It is not natural! Mélisande! Where art thou?--Where goest thou? [_Perceiving_ ARKËL _and the_ PHYSICIAN _at the door of the room.]--_ Yes, yes; you may come in.... I know nothing; it is useless.... It is too late; she is already too far away from us.... I shall never know!... I shall die here like a blind man!...  ARKËL.  What have you done? You will kill her....  GOLAUD.  I have already killed her....  ARKËL.  Mélisande....  MÉLISANDE.  Is it you, grandfather?  ARKËL.  Yes, my daughter.... What would you have me do?  MÉLISANDE.  Is it true that the winter is beginning?...  ARKËL.  Why dost thou ask?  MÉLISANDE.  Because it is cold, and there are no more leaves....  ARKËL.  Thou art cold?--Wilt thou have the windows closed?  MÉLISANDE.  No, no,... not till the sun be at the bottom of the sea.--It sinks slowly; then it is the winter beginning?  ARKËL.  Yes.--Thou dost not like the winter?  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! no. I am afraid of the cold.--I am so afraid of the great cold....  ARKËL.  Dost thou feel better?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes; I have no longer all those qualms....  ARKËL.  Wouldst thou see thy child?  MÉLISANDE.  What child?  ARKËL.  Thy child.--Thou art a mother.... Thou hast brought a little daughter into the world....  MÉLISANDE.  Where is she?  ARKËL.  Here....  MÉLISANDE.  It is strange.... I cannot lift my arms to take her....  ARKËL.  Because you are still very weak.... I will hold her myself; look....  MÉLISANDE.  She does not laugh.... She is little.... She is going to weep too.... I pity her....      [The room has been invaded, little by little, by the women     servants of the castle, who range themselves in silence along     the walls and wait]  GOLAUD (_rising abruptly_).  What is the matter?--What are all these women coming here for?...  THE PHYSICIAN.  It is the servants....  ARKËL.  Who was it called them?  THE PHYSICIAN.  It was not I....  GOLAUD.  Why do you come here?--No one has asked for you.... What come you here to do?--But what is it, then?--Answer me!...                                             [_The servants make no answer._  ARKËL.  Do not speak too loud.... She is going to sleep; she has closed her eyes....  GOLAUD.  It is not...?  THE PHYSICIAN.  No, no; see, she breathes....  ARKËL.  Her eyes are full of tears.--It is her soul weeping now.... Why does she stretch her arms out so?--What would she?  THE PHYSICIAN.  It is toward the child, without doubt.... It is the straggle of motherhood against...  GOLAUD.  At this moment?--At this moment?--You must say. Say! Say!...  THE PHYSICIAN.  Perhaps.  GOLAUD.  At once?... Oh! oh! I must tell her....--Mélisande! Mélisande!... Leave me alone! leave me alone with her!...  ARKËL.  No, no; "]]]
