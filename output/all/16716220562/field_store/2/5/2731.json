These are sold by their parents (sometimes stolen from them), about the age of 4, and educated, while they are also subjected to a special physical training, which includes massage of the gluteal regions to favor development, dilatation of the anus, and epilation (which is not, however, practised by Chinese women). At the same time, they are taught music, singing, drawing, and the art of poetry. The waiters at the restaurants always know where these young gentlemen are to be found when they are required to grace a rich man's feast. They are generally accompanied by a guardian, and usually nothing very serious takes place, for they know their value, and money will not always buy their expensive favors. They are very effeminate, luxuriously dressed and perfumed, and they seldom go on foot. There are, however, lower orders of such prostitutes.[26]  Homosexuality is easily traceable in India. Dubois referred to houses devoted to male prostitution, with men dressed as women, and imitating the ways of women.[27] Burton in the \"Terminal Essay\" to his translation of the _Arabian Nights_, states that when in 1845 Sir Charles Napier conquered and annexed Sind three brothels of eunuchs and boys were found in the small town of Karachi, and Burton was instructed to visit and report on them. Hindus, in general, however, it appears, hold homosexuality in abhorrence. In Afghanistan homosexuality is more generally accepted, and Burton stated that \"each caravan is accompanied by a number of boys and lads almost in woman's attire, with kohled eyes and rouged cheeks, long tresses and hennaed fingers and toes, riding luxuriously in camel paniers.\"  If we turn to the New World, we find that among the American Indians, from the Eskimo of Alaska downward to Brazil and still farther south, homosexual customs have been very frequently observed. Sometimes they are regarded by the tribe with honor, sometimes with indifference, sometimes with contempt; but they appear to be always tolerated. Although there are local differences, these customs, on the whole, seem to have much in common. The best early description which I have been able to find is by Langsdorff[28] and concerns the Aleuts of Oonalashka in Alaska: \"Boys, if they happen to be very handsome,\" he says, \"are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls, and instructed in the arts women use to please men; their beards are carefully plucked out as soon as they begin to appear, and their chins tattooed like those of women; they wear ornaments of glass beads upon their legs and arms, bind and cut their hair in the same manner as the women, and supply their place with the men as concubines. This shocking, unnatural, and immoral practice has obtained here even from the remotest times; nor have any measures hitherto been taken to repress and restrain it; such men are known under the name of _schopans_.\"  Among the Konyagas Langsdorff found the custom much more common than among the Aleuts; he remarks that, although the mothers brought up some of their children in this way, they seemed very fond of their offspring. Lisiansky, at about the same period, tells us that: \"Of all the customs of these islanders, the most disgusting is that of men, called _schoopans_, living with men, and supplying the place of women. These are brought up from their infancy with females, and taught all the feminine arts. They even assume the manner and dress of the women so nearly that a stranger would naturally take them for what they are not. This odious practice was formerly so prevalent that the residence of one of these monsters in a house was considered as fortunate; it is, however, daily losing ground.\"[29] He mentions a case in which a priest had nearly married two males, when an interpreter chanced to come in and was able to inform him what he was doing.  The practice has, however, apparently continued to be fairly common among the Alaska Eskimos down to recent times. Thus Dr. Engelmann mentioned to me that he was informed by those who had lived in Alaska, especially near Point Barrow, that as many as 5 such individuals (regarded by uninstructed strangers as \"hermaphrodites\") might be found in a single comparatively small community. It is stated by Davydoff, as quoted by Holmberg,[30] that the boy is selected to be a _schopan_ because he is girl-like. This is a point of some interest as it indicates that the schopan is not effeminated solely by suggestion and association, but is probably feminine by inborn constitution.  In Louisiana, Florida, Yucatan, etc., somewhat similar customs exist or have existed. In Brazil men are to be found dressed as women and solely occupying themselves with feminine occupations; they are not very highly regarded.[31] They are called _cudinas_: i.e., circumcized. Among the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico these individuals are called _mujerados_ (supposed to be a corruption of _mujeriego_) and are the chief passive agents in the homosexual ceremonies of these people. They are said to be intentionally effeminated in early life by much masturbation and by constant horse-riding.[32]  Among all the tribes of the northwest United States sexual inverts may be found. The invert is called a _boté_ (\"not man, not woman\") by the Montana, and a _burdash_ (\"half-man, half-woman\") by the Washington Indians. The _boté_ has been carefully studied by Dr. A.B. Holder.[33] Holder finds that the _boté_ wears woman's dress, and that his speech and manners are feminine. The dress and manners are assumed in childhood, but no sexual practices take place until puberty. These consist in the practice of _fellatio_ by the _boté_, who probably himself experiences the orgasm at the same time. The _boté_ is not a pederast, although pederasty occurs among these Indians. Holder examined _boté_ who was splendidly made, prepossessing, and in perfect health. With much reluctance he agreed to a careful examination. The sexual organs were quite normal, though perhaps not quite so large as his _physique_ would suggest, but he had never had intercourse with a woman. On removing his clothes he pressed his thighs together, as a timid woman would, so as to conceal completely the sexual organs; Holder says that the thighs \"really, or to my fancy,\" had the feminine rotundity. He has heard a _boté_ \"_beg_ a male Indian to submit to his caress,\" and he tells that \"one little fellow, while in the agency boarding-school, was found frequently surreptitiously wearing female attire. He was punished, but finally escaped from school and became a _boté_, which vocation he has since followed.\"  At Tahiti at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Turnbull[34] found that \"there are a set of men in this country whose open profession is of such abomination that the laudable delicacy of our language will not admit it to be mentioned. These are called by the natives _Mahoos_; they assume the dress, attitude, and manners of women, and affect all the fantastic oddities and coquetries of the vainest of females. They mostly associate with the women, who court their acquaintance. With the manners of the women they adopt their peculiar employments, making cloth, bonnets, and mats; and so completely are they unsexed that had they not been pointed out to me I should not have known them but as women. I add, with some satisfaction, that the encouragement of this abomination is almost solely confined to the chiefs.\"  Among the Sakalaves of Madagascar there are certain boys called _sekatra_, as described by Lasnet, who are apparently chosen from childhood on account of weak or delicate appearance and brought up as girls. They live like women and have intercourse with men, with or without sodomy, paying the men who please them.[35]  Among the negro population of Zanzibar forms of homosexuality which are believed to be congenital (as well as acquired forms) are said to be fairly common. Their frequency is thought to be due to Arab influence. The male congenital inverts show from their earliest years no aptitude for men's occupations, but are attracted toward female occupations. As they grow older they wear women's clothes, dress their hair in women's fashion, and behave altogether like women. They associate only with women and with male prostitutes, and they obtain sexual satisfaction by passive pederasty or in ways simulating coitus. In appearance they resemble ordinary male prostitutes, who are common in Zanzibar, but it is noteworthy that the natives make a clear distinction between them and men prostitutes. The latter are looked down on with contempt, while the former, as being what they are \"by the will of God,\" are tolerated.[36]  Homosexuality; occurs in various parts of Africa. Cases of _effeminatio_ and passive sodomy have been reported from Unyamwezi and Uganda. Among the Bangala of the Upper Congo sodomy between men is very common, especially when they are away from home, in strange towns, or in fishing camps. If, however, a man had intercourse with a woman _per anum_ he was at one time liable to be put to death.[37]  Among the Papuans in some parts of New Guinea, as already mentioned, homosexuality is said to be well recognized, and is resorted to for convenience as well, perhaps, as for Malthusian reasons.[38] But in the Rigo district of British New Guinea, where habitual sodomy is not practised, Dr. Seligmann, of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, made some highly important observations on several men and women who clearly appeared to be cases of congenital sexual inversion with some degree of esthetic inversion and even some anatomical modification.[39] These people, it may be noted, belong to a primitive race, uncontaminated by contact with white races, and practically still in the Stone Age.  Finally, among another allied primitive people, the Australians, it would appear that homosexuality has long been well established in tribal customs. Among the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#5)"],["body","of Kimberley, Western Australia (who are by no means of low type, quick and intelligent, with special aptitudes for learning languages and music), if a wife is not obtainable for a young man he is presented with a boy-wife between the ages of 5 and 10 (the age when a boy receives his masculine initiation). The exact nature of the relations between the boy-wife and his protector are doubtful; they certainly have connection, but the natives repudiate with horror and disgust the idea of sodomy.[40]  Further light is thrown on homosexuality in Australia by the supposition of Spencer and Gillen that the _mika_ operation (urethral subincision), an artificial hypospadias, is for the purpose of homosexual intercourse. Klaatsch has discussed the homosexual origin of the _mika_ operation on the basis of information he received from missionaries at Niol-Niol, on the northwest coast. The subincised man acts as a female to the as yet unoperated boys, who perform coitus in the incised opening. Both informed Klaatsch in 1906 that at Boulia in Queensland the operated men are said to \"possess a vulva.\"[41]  These various accounts are of considerable interest, though for the most part their precise significance remains doubtful. Some of them, however,--such as Holder's description of the _boté_, Baumann's account of homosexual phenomena in Zanzibar, and especially Seligmann's observations in British New Guinea,--indicate not only the presence of esthetic inversion but of true congenital sexual inversion. The extent of the evidence will doubtless be greatly enlarged as the number of competent observers increases, and crucial points are no longer so frequently overlooked.  On the whole, the evidence shows that among lower races homosexual practices are regarded with considerable indifference, and the real invert, if he exists among them, as doubtless he does exist, generally passes unperceived or joins some sacred caste which sanctifies his exclusively homosexual inclinations.  Even in Europe today a considerable lack of repugnance to homosexual practices may be found among the lower classes. In this matter, as folklore shows in so many other matters, the uncultured man of civilization is linked to the savage. In England, I am told, the soldier often has little or no objection to prostitute himself to the \"swell\" who pays him, although for pleasure he prefers to go to women; and Hyde Park is spoken of as a center of male prostitution.      \"Among the working masses of England and Scotland,\" Q. writes,     \"'comradeship' is well marked, though not (as in Italy) very     conscious of itself. Friends often kiss each other, though this     habit seems to vary a good deal in different sections and     coteries. Men commonly sleep together, whether comrades or not,     and so easily get familiar. Occasionally, but not so very often,     this relation delays for a time, or even indefinitely, actual     marriage, and in some instances is highly passionate and     romantic. There is a good deal of grossness, no doubt, here and     there in this direction among the masses; but there are no male     prostitutes (that I am aware of) whose regular clients are manual     workers. This kind of prostitution in London is common enough,     but I have only a slight personal knowledge of it. Many youths     are 'kept' handsomely in apartments by wealthy men, and they are,     of course, not always inaccessible to others. Many keep     themselves in lodgings by this means, and others eke out scanty     wages by the same device: just like women, in fact. Choirboys     reinforce the ranks to a considerable extent, and private     soldiers to a large extent. Some of the barracks (notably     Knightsbridge) are great centres. On summer evenings Hyde Park     and the neighborhood of Albert Gate is full of guardsmen and     others plying a lively trade, and with little disguise, in     uniform or out. In these cases it sometimes only amounts to a     chat on a retired seat or a drink at a bar; sometimes recourse is     had to a room in some known lodging-house, or to one or two     hotels which lend themselves to this kind of business. In any     case it means a covetable addition to Tommy Atkins's     pocket-money.\" And Mr. Raffalovich, speaking of London, remarks:     \"The number of soldiers who prostitute themselves is greater than     we are willing to believe. It is no exaggeration to say that in     certain regiments the presumption is in favor of the venality of     the majority of the men.\" It is worth noting that there is a     perfect understanding in this matter between soldiers and the     police, who may always be relied upon by the former for     assistance and advice. I am indebted to my correspondent \"Z\" for     the following notes: \"Soldiers are no less sought after in France     than in England or in Germany, and special houses exist for     military prostitution both in Paris and the garrison-towns. Many     facts known about the French army go to prove that these habits     have been contracted in Algeria, and have spread to a formidable     extent through whole regiments. The facts related by Ulrichs     about the French foreign legion, on the testimony of a credible     witness who had been a pathic in his regiment, deserve attention     (_Ara Spei_, p. 20; _Memnon_, p. 27). This man, who was a German,     told Ulrichs that the Spanish, French, and Italian soldiers were     the lovers, the Swiss and German their beloved (see also General     Brossier's Report, quoted by Burton, _Arabian Nights_, vol. x, p.     251). In Lucien Descaves's military novel, _Sous Offs_ (Paris,     Tresse et Stock, 1890), some details are given regarding     establishments for male prostitution. See pages 322, 412, and 417     for description of the drinking-shop called 'Aux Amis de     l'Armée,' where a few maids were kept for show, and also of its     frequenters, including, in particular, the Adjutant Laprévotte.     Ulrichs reports that in the Austrian army lectures on homosexual     vices are regularly given to cadets and conscripts (_Memnon_, p.     26). A soldier who had left the army told a friend of mine that     he and many of his comrades had taken to homosexual indulgences     when abroad on foreign service in a lonely station. He kept the     practice up in England 'because the women of his class were so     unattractive.' The captain of an English man-of-war said that he     was always glad to send his men on shore after a long cruise at     sea, never feeling sure how far they might not all go if left     without women for a certain space of time.\" I may add that A.     Hamon (_La France Sociale et Politique_, 1891, pp. 653-55; also     in his _Psychologie du Militaire Professional_, chapter x) gives     details as to the prevalence of homosexuality in the French army,     especially in Algeria; he regards it as extremely common,     although the majority are free. A fragment of a letter by General     Lamoricière (speaking of Marshal Changarnier) is quoted: _En     Afrique nous en étions tous, mais lui en est resté ici_.  This primitive indifference is doubtless also a factor in the prevalence of homosexuality among criminals, although, here, it must be remembered, two other factors (congenital abnormality and the isolation of imprisonment) have to be considered. In Russia, Tarnowsky observes that all pederasts are agreed that the common people are tolerably indifferent to their sexual advances, which they call \"gentlemen's games.\" A correspondent remarks on \"the fact, patent to all observers, that simple folk not infrequently display no greater disgust for the abnormalities of sexual appetite than they do for its normal manifestations.\"[42] He knows of many cases in which men of lower class were flattered and pleased by the attentions of men of higher class, although not themselves inverted. And from this point of view the following case, which he mentions, is very instructive:--      A pervert whom I can trust told me that he had made advances to     upward of one hundred men in the course of the last fourteen     years, and that he had only once met with a refusal (in which     case the man later on offered himself spontaneously) and only     once with an attempt to extort money. Permanent relations of     friendship sprang up in most instances. He admitted that he     looked after these persons and helped them with his social     influence and a certain amount of pecuniary support--setting one     up in business, giving another something to marry on, and finding     places for others.  Among the peasantry in Switzerland, I am informed, homosexual relationships are not uncommon before marriage, and such relationships are lightly spoken of as \"Dummheiten\". No doubt, similar traits might be found in the peasantry of other parts of Europe.  What may be regarded as true sexual inversion can be traced in Europe from the beginning of the Christian era (though we can scarcely demonstrate the congenital element) especially among two classes--men of exceptional ability and criminals; and also, it may be added, among those neurotic and degenerate individuals who may be said to lie between these two classes, and on or over the borders of both. Homosexuality, mingled with various other sexual abnormalities and excesses, seems to have flourished in Rome during the empire, and is well exemplified in the persons of many of the emperors.[43] Julius Cæsar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Commodus, and Heliogabalus--many of them men of great ability and, from a Roman standpoint, great moral worth--are all charged, on more or less solid evidence, with homosexual practices. In Julius Cæsar--\"the husband of all women and the wife of all men\" as he was satirically termed--excess of sexual activity seems to have accompanied, as is sometimes seen, an excess of intellectual activity. He was"]]]
