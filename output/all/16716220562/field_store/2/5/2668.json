He read that book reverentially all the way home. It did not give him what he wanted, but that doubtless was his own fault. He pored over it, studied it, loved it, never doubting that now he had the key to all the wonders and mysteries of Nature. It was five years before he fully found out that the text was the most worthless trash ever foisted on a torpid public. Nevertheless, the book held some useful things; first, a list of the bird names; second, some thirty vile travesties of Audubon and Wilson's bird portraits.  These were the birds thus maligned:  Duck Hawk                     Rose-breasted Grosbeak Sparrow Hawk                  Bobolink White-headed Eagle            Meadow Lark Great Horned Owl              Bluejay Snowy Owl                     Ruffed Grouse Red-headed Woodpecker         Great Blue Heron Golden-winged Woodpecker      Bittern Barn-swallow                  Wilson's Snipe Whip-poor-will                Long-biller Curlew Night Hawk                    Purple Gallinule Belted Kingfisher             Canada Goose Kingbird                      Wood Duck Woodthrush                    Hooded Merganser Catbird                       Double-crested Cormorant White-bellied Nuthatch        Arctic Tern Brown Creeper                 Great Northern Diver Bohemian Chatterer            Stormy Petrel Great Northern Shrike         Arctic Puffin Shore Lark                    Black Guillemot  [Illustration: \"He already knew the Downy Woodpecker\"]   But badly as they were presented, the pictures were yet information, and were entered in his memory as lasting accessions to his store of truth about the Wild Things.  Of course, he already knew some few birds whose names are familiar to every schoolboy: the Robin, Bluebird, Kingbird, Wild Canary, Woodpecker, Barn-swallow, Wren, Chickadee, Wild Pigeon, Humming-bird, Pewee, so that his list was steadily increased.     V  The Collarless Stranger     Oh, sympathy! the noblest gift of God to man.   The greatest bond there is twixt man and man.   The strongest link in any friendship chain.   The single lasting hold in kinship's claim.   The only incorrosive strand in marriage bonds.   The blazing torch where genius lights her lamp.   The ten times noble base of noblest love.   More deep than love--more strong than hate--the biggest thing   in all the universe--the law of laws.   Grant but this greatest gift of God to man--this single link   concatenating grant, and all the rest are worthless or comprised.  Each year the ancient springtime madness came more strongly on Yan. Each year he was less inclined to resist it, and one glorious day of late April in its twelfth return he had wandered northward along to a little wood a couple of miles from the town. It was full of unnamed flowers and voices and mysteries. Every tree and thicket had a voice--a long ditch full of water had many that called to him. \"_Peep-peep-peep_,\" they seemed to say in invitation for him to come and see. He crawled again and again to the ditch and watched and waited. The loud whistle would sound only a few rods away, \"_Peep-peep-peep_,\" but ceased at each spot when he came near--sometimes before him, sometimes behind, but never where he was. He searched through a small pool with his hands, sifted out sticks and leaves, but found nothing else. A farmer going by told him it was only a \"spring Peeper,\" whatever that was, \"some kind of a critter in the water.\"  Under a log not far away Yan found a little Lizard that tumbled out of sight into a hole. It was the only living thing there, so he decided that the \"Peeper\" must be a \"Whistling Lizard.\" But he was determined to see them when they were calling. How was it that the ponds all around should be full of them calling to him and playing hide and seek and yet defying his most careful search? The voices ceased as soon as he came near, to be gradually renewed in the pools he had left. His presence was a husher. He lay for a long time watching a pool, but none of the voices began again in range of his eye. At length, after realizing that they were avoiding him, he crawled to a very noisy pond without showing himself, and nearer and yet nearer until he was within three feet of a loud peeper in the floating grass. He located the spot within a few inches and yet could see nothing. He was utterly baffled, and lay there puzzling over it, when suddenly all the near Peepers stopped, and Yan was startled by a footfall; and looking around, he saw a man within a few feet, watching him.  Yan reddened--a stranger was always an enemy; he had a natural aversion to all such, and stared awkwardly as though caught in crime.  The man, a curious looking middle-aged person, was in shabby clothes and wore no collar. He had a tin box strapped on his bent shoulders, and in his hands was a long-handled net. His features, smothered in a grizzly beard, were very prominent and rugged. They gave evidence of intellectual force, with some severity, but his gray-blue eyes had a kindly look.  He had on a common, unbecoming, hard felt hat, and when he raised it to admit the pleasant breeze Yan saw that the wearer had hair like his own--a coarse, paleolithic mane, piled on his rugged brow, like a mass of seaweed lodged on some storm-beaten rock.  \"F'what are ye fynding, my lad?\" said he in tones whose gentleness was in no way obscured by a strong Scottish tang.  Still resenting somewhat the stranger's presence, Yan said:  \"I'm not finding anything; I am only trying to see what that Whistling Lizard is like.\"  The stranger's eyes twinkled. \"Forty years ago Ah was laying by a pool just as Ah seen ye this morning, looking and trying hard to read the riddle of the spring Peeper. Ah lay there all day, aye, and mony anither day, yes, it was nigh onto three years before Ah found it oot. Ah'll be glad to save ye seeking as long as Ah did, if that's yer mind. Ah'll show ye the Peeper.\"  Then he raked carefully among the leaves near the ditch, and soon captured a tiny Frog, less than an inch long.  \"Ther's your Whistling Lizard: he no a Lizard at all, but a Froggie. Book men call him _Hyla pickeringii_, an' a gude Scotchman he'd make, for ye see the St. Andrew's cross on his wee back. Ye see the whistling ones in the water put on'y their beaks oot an' is hard to see. Then they sinks to the bottom when ye come near. But you tak this'n home and treat him well and ye'll see him blow out his throat as big as himsel' an' whistle like a steam engine.\"  Yan thawed out now. He told about the Lizard he had seen.  \"That wasna a Lizard; Ah niver see thim aboot here. It must a been a two-striped _Spelerpes_. A _Spelerpes_ is nigh kin to a Frog--a kind of dry-land tadpole, while a Lizard is only a Snake with legs.\"  This was light from heaven. All Yan's distrust was gone. He warmed to the stranger. He plied him with questions; he told of his getting the Bird Book. Oh, how the stranger did snort at \"that driveling trash.\" Yan talked of his perplexities. He got a full hearing and intelligent answers. His mystery of the black ground-bird with a brown mate was resolved into the Common Towhee. The unknown wonderful voice in the spring morning, sending out its \"_cluck, cluck, cluck, clucker_,\" in the distant woods, the large gray Woodpecker that bored in some high stub and flew in a blaze of gold, and the wonderful spotted bird with red head and yellow wings and tail in the taxidermist's window, were all resolved into one and the same--the Flicker or Golden-winged Woodpecker. The Hang-nest and the Oriole became one. The unknown poisonous-looking blue Hornet, that sat on the mud with palpitating body, and the strange, invisible thing that made the mud-nests inside old outbuildings and crammed them with crippled Spiders, were both identified as the Mud-wasp or _Pelop√¶us_.  A black Butterfly flew over, and Yan learned that it was a Camberwell Beauty, or, scientifically, a _Vanessa antiopa_, and that this one must have hibernated to be seen so early in the spring, and yet more, that this beautiful creature was the glorified spirit of the common brown and black spiney Caterpillar.  The Wild Pigeons were flying high above them in great flocks as they sat there, and Yan learned of their great nesting places in the far South, and of their wonderful but exact migrations without regard to anything but food; their northward migration to gather the winged nuts of the Slippery Elm in Canada; their August flight to the rice-fields of Carolina; their Mississippi Valley pilgrimage when the acorns and beech-mast were falling ripe.  What a rich, full morning that was. Everything seemed to turn up for them. As they walked over a piney hill, two large birds sprang from the ground and whirred through the trees.  \"Ruffed Grouse or 'patridge', as the farmers call them. There's a pair lives nigh aboots here. They come on this bank for the Wintergreen berries.\"  And Yan was quick to pull and taste them. He filled his pockets with the aromatic plant--berries and all--and chewed it as he went. While they walked, a faint, far drum-thump fell on their ears. \"What's that?\" he exclaimed, ever on the alert. The stranger listened and said:  \"That's the bird ye ha' just seen; that's the Cock Partridge drumming for his mate.\"  The Pewee of his early memories became the Phoebe of books. That day his brookside singer became the Song-sparrow; the brown triller, the Veery Thrush. The Trilliums, white and red, the Dogtooth Violet, the Spring-beauty, the Trailing Arbutus--all for the first time got names and became real friends, instead of elusive and beautiful, but depressing mysteries.  The stranger warmed, too, and his rugged features glowed; he saw in Yan one minded like himself, tormented with the knowledge-hunger, as in youth he himself had been; and now it was a priceless privilege to save the boy some of what he had suffered. His"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],["title","Two Little Savages (#3)"],["body","to Yan grew fervid, and Yan--he took in every word; nothing that he heard was forgotten. He was in a dream, for he had found at last the greatest thing on earth--sympathy--broad, intelligent, comprehensive sympathy.  That spring morning was ever after like a new epoch in Yan's mind--not his memory, that was a thing of the past--but in his mind, his living present.  And the strongest, realest thing in it all was, not the rugged stranger with his kind ways, not the new birds and plants, but the smell of the Wintergreen.  Smell's appeal to the memory is far better, stronger, more real than that of any other sense. The Indians know this; many of them, in time, find out the smell that conjures up their happiest hours, and keep it by them in the medicine bag. It is very real and dear to them--that handful of Pine needles, that lump of Rat-musk, or that piece of Spruce gum. It adds the crown of happy memory to their reveries.  And yet this belief is one of the first attacked by silly White-men, who profess to enlighten the Red-man's darkness. They, in their ignorance, denounce it as absurd, while men of science know its simple truth.  Yan did not know that he had stumbled on a secret of the Indian medicine bag. But ever afterward that wonderful day was called back to him, conjured up by his \"medicine,\" this simple, natural magic, the smell of the Wintergreen.  He appreciated that morning more than he could tell, and yet he did a characteristic foolish thing, that put him in a wrong light and left him so in the stranger's mind.  It was past noon. They had long lingered; the Stranger spoke of the many things he had at home; then at length said he must be going. \"Weel, good-by, laddie; Ah hope Ah'll see you again.\" He held out his hand. Yan shook it warmly; but he was dazed with thinking and with reaction; his diffidence and timidity were strong; he never rose to the stranger's veiled offer. He let him go without even learning his name or address.  When it was too late, Yan awoke to his blunder. He haunted all those woods in hopes of chancing on him there again, but he never did.     VI  Glenyan   Oh! what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! How their trumpet clang went thrilling in his heart, to smite there new and hidden chords that stirred and sang response. Was there ever a nobler bird than that great black-necked Swan, that sings not at his death, but in his flood of life, a song of home and of peace--of stirring deeds and hunting in far-off climes--of hungerings and food, and raging thirsts to meet with cooling drink. A song of wind and marching, a song of bursting green and grinding ice--of Arctic secrets and of hidden ways. A song of a long black marsh, a low red sky, and a sun that never sets.  An Indian jailed for theft bore bravely through the winter, but when the springtime brought the Gander-clang in the black night sky, he started, fell, and had gone to his last, long, hunting home.  Who can tell why Jericho should fall at the trumpet blast?  Who can read or measure the power of the Honker-song?  Oh, what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! And yet, was it a new song? No, the old, old song, but Yan heard it with new ears. He was learning to read its message. He wandered on their trailless track, as often as he could, northward, ever northward, up the river from the town, and up, seeking the loneliest ways and days. The river turned to the east, but a small stream ran into it from the north: up that Yan went through thickening woods and walls that neared each other, on and up until the walls closed to a crack, then widened out into a little dale that was still full of original forest trees. Hemlock, Pine, Birch and Elm of the largest size abounded and spread over the clear brook a continuous shade. Fox vines trailed in the open places, the rarest wild-flowers flourished, Red-squirrels chattered from the trees. In the mud along the brook-side were tracks of Coon and Mink and other strange fourfoots. And in the trees overhead, the Veery, the Hermit-thrush, or even a Woodthrush sang his sweetly solemn strain, in that golden twilight of the midday forest. Yan did not know them all by name as yet, but he felt their vague charm and mystery. It seemed such a far and lonely place, so unspoiled by man, that Yan persuaded himself that surely he was the first human being to stand there, that it was his by right of discovery, and so he claimed it and named it after its discoverer--Glenyan.  This place became the central thought in his life. He went there at all opportunities, but never dared to tell any one of his discovery. He longed for a confidant sometimes, he hankered to meet the stranger and take him there, and still he feared that the secret would get out. This was his little kingdom; the Wild Geese had brought him here, as the Seagulls had brought Columbus to a new world--where he could lead, for brief spells, the woodland life that was his ideal. He was tender enough to weep over the downfall of a lot of fine Elm trees in town, when their field was sold for building purposes, and he used to suffer a sort of hungry regret when old settlers told how plentiful the Deer used to be. But now he had a relief from these sorrows, for surely there was one place where the great trees should stand and grow as in the bright bygone; where the Coon, the Mink and the Partridge should live and flourish forever. No, indeed, no one else should know of it, for if the secret got out, at least hosts of visitors would come and Glenyan be defiled. No, better that the secret should \"die with him,\" he said. What that meant he did not really know, but he had read the phrase somewhere and he liked the sound of it. Possibly he would reveal it on his deathbed.  Yes, that was the proper thing, and he pictured a harrowing scene of weeping relatives around, himself as central figure, all ceasing their wailing and gasping with wonder as he made known the mighty secret of his life--delicious! it was almost worth dying for.  So he kept the place to himself and loved it more and more. He would look out through the thick Hemlock tops, the blots of Basswood green or the criss-cross Butternut leafage and say: \"My own, my own.\" Or down by some pool in the limpid stream he would sit and watch the arrowy Shiners and say: \"You are mine, all; you are mine. You shall never be harmed or driven away.\"  A spring came from the hillside by a green lawn, and here Yan would eat his sandwiches varied with nuts and berries that he did not like, but ate only because he was a wildman, and would look lovingly up the shady brookland stretches and down to the narrow entrance of the glen, and say and think and feel. \"This is mine, my own, my very own.\"     VII  The Shanty   He had none but the poorest of tools, but he set about building a shanty. He was not a resourceful boy. His effort to win the book had been an unusual one for him, as his instincts were not at all commercial. When that matter came to the knowledge of the Home Government, he was rebuked for doing \"work unworthy of a gentleman's son\" and forbidden under frightful penalties \"ever again to resort to such degrading ways of raising money.\"  They gave him no money, so he was penniless. Most boys would have possessed themselves somehow of a good axe and spade. He had neither. An old plane blade, fastened to a stick with nails, was all the axe and spade he had, yet with this he set to work and offset its poorness as a tool by dogged persistency. First, he selected the quietest spot near the spring--a bank hidden by a mass of foliage. He knew no special reason for hiding it, beyond the love of secrecy. He had read in some of his books \"how the wily scouts led the way through a pathless jungle, pulled aside a bough and there revealed a comfortable dwelling that none without the secret could possibly have discovered,\" so it seemed very proper to make it a complete mystery--a sort of secret panel in the enchanted castle--and so picture himself as the wily scout leading his wondering companions to the shanty, though, of course, he had not made up his mind to reveal his secret to any one. He often wished he could have the advantage of Rad's strong arms and efficacious tools; but the workshop incident was only one of many that taught him to leave his brother out of all calculation.  Mother Earth is the best guardian of a secret, and Yan with his crude spade began by digging a hole in the bank. The hard blue clay made the work slow, but two holidays spent in steady labour resulted in a hole seven feet wide and about four feet into the bank.  In this he set about building the shanty. Logs seven or eight feet long must be got to the place--at least twenty-five or thirty would be needed, and how to cut and handle them with his poor axe was a question. Somehow, he never looked for a better axe. The half-formed notion that the Indians had no better was sufficient support, and he struggled away bravely, using whatever ready sized material he could find. Each piece as he brought it was put into place. Some boys would have gathered the logs first and built it all at once, but that was not Yan's way; he was too eager to see the walls rise. He had painfully and slowly gathered logs enough to raise the walls three rounds, when the question of a door occurred to him. This, of course, could not be cut through the logs in the ordinary way; that required the best of tools. So he lifted out all the front logs except the lowest, replacing them at the ends with stones and blocks to sustain the sides. This gave him the sudden gain of two logs, and helped the rest of the walls that much. The shanty was now about three feet high, and no two logs in it were alike: some were much too long, most were crooked and some were half rotten, for the simple reason that these were the only ones he could cut. He had exhausted the logs in the neighbourhood and was forced to go farther. Now he remembered seeing one that might do, half a mile"]]]
