Ho, you must be thinking of my daddy.  ANITA. Your daddy? Is Santa Claus your daddy?  JACK FROST. Sure, he is. I'm Jack Frost Santa Claus, Jr. Most folks call me Jolly Jack Frost. The little fat man with the white beard is my father.  ANITA (_astonished_). Why, I didn't know Santa Claus had any leetla boys.  JACK FROST. Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer, and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?  ANITA. Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?  JACK FROST. Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees. You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.  ANITA. Oh, I'd love to see them.  JACK FROST. We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most of the candy comes from mines.  ANITA. The mines?  JACK FROST. Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right through the picture-book garden.  ANITA. Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.  JACK FROST. And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little brothers, and we're all twins.  ANITA. And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a wife?  JACK FROST (_laughs_). Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.  ANITA. Mary? Mary what?  JACK FROST. Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone knew that.  ANITA. And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night before Christmas?  JACK FROST. Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and takes care of the gardens.  ANITA. But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd be with your father.  JACK FROST. Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.  ANITA. How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.  JACK FROST. Well, maybe I'll tell you.  ANITA. Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg, grand-a secret.  JACK FROST. You can keep a secret, can't you?  ANITA. Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.  JACK FROST. Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?  ANITA. Yes. But how did you know?  JACK FROST. Oh, we know everything. How old are you?  ANITA. If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.  JACK FROST. Well, I just guessed it.  ANITA. Then why don't you guess how old I am?  JACK FROST. Cute, ain't you?  ANITA. Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.  JACK FROST. Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.  ANITA. Cross my heart. (_She does so._)  JACK FROST (_crosses to her_). Listen, then; here's the secret. (_He whispers in her ear._)  ANITA (_after a pause, while he is whispering_). He is? _He is?_ Oh!!  JACK FROST (_nods his head wisely_). Yes, he is.  ANITA. Honest?  JACK FROST. Honest injun!  ANITA. With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?  JACK FROST (_nods head emphatically_). Yes, ma'am, every single thing.  ANITA. Tonight?  JACK FROST. Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.  ANITA. But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?  JACK FROST. Fly.  ANITA. Fly? But he hasn't any wings. (JACK _nods._) He has? (JACK _nods._) Really and truly wings?  JACK FROST (_nods_). Really and truly wings.  ANITA. I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.  JACK FROST. He only bought them this year.  ANITA. Bought them? (JACK _nods._) Then they didn't grow on him?  JACK FROST (_laughs_). Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.  ANITA. Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.  JACK FROST. He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. (_Sits down._) Oh, I'm tired.  ANITA. I didn't know pixies ever got tired.  JACK FROST. You ought to see the work I've done today.  ANITA. Here on the boat?  JACK FROST. Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.  ANITA. Oh, show me.  JACK FROST. I will. But it's part of the secret. (_Goes to rear L._) Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.  ANITA (_goes to him_). It isn't anything scary, is it?  JACK FROST. Of course not. (_Lets her peep through the curtain that conceals the Christmas tree from the audience._) There; what do you think of that?  ANITA. Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.  JACK FROST. Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.  ANITA. But are you really, truly sure he's coming?  JACK FROST. Of course he is. That is our secret.  ANITA. Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.  JACK FROST. What are you going to do when you get to America?  ANITA. I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.  JACK FROST. Take the monkey's place?  ANITA. Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! (_Poses and holds out tambourine._) And then I will-a collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.  JACK FROST (_mocking her_). I suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way (_imitates a monkey_), and say, \"Give-a de monk de cent!\"  ANITA (_laughing_). Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! (_Hums and dances, or a song may be introduced at this point by_ ANITA.) Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! (_Does so._) And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?  JACK FROST (_sighs, then drops a nickel in tambourine_). Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.  ANITA. And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.  JACK FROST. Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing touches on--you know what! (_Goes behind curtains that conceal the Christmas tree._)  ANITA (_looks around_). Why, he's gone.  JACK FROST (_sticking his head out of the curtains_). The sun has set, it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good-night! (_Disappears back of curtains._)  ANITA. Good-night, Jolly Jack Frost, good-night. Oh, it's the most wonderful secret in all the world. And won't the leetla children be glad to know that old Santa Claus has not forgotten them. He said that Santa Claus was coming tonight in the air ship, and it's got to be true, it's just got to be true.  _Enter_ TOMASSO _from R., carrying violin._  TOMASSO. Anita, if you don't hurry you'll not get any supper at all. It's most eight o'clock.  ANITA. Oh, I don't care for supper, Tomasso. I could-a not eat. I'm too much excited to eat.  TOMASSO. What make-a you so excited, Anita?  ANITA. Why, tonight--(pauses as she remembers her promise) Oh, that I cannot tell; it's a secret.  TOMASSO. What is the secret?  ANITA. If I told-a you, Tomasso, then it would no longer be a secret.  TOMASSO. You should-a not have the secrets from me, Anita. I am your cousin, also--I am the head of the family.  ANITA. But I made the promise not to tell.  TOMASSO. Who you make-a the promise to?  ANITA. I promised Jack--(_hesitates_) I mean, I make-a de promise to someone.  TOMASSO. To Jack! Who is this-a Jack, Anita?  ANITA. That is part of the secret. Listen, Tomasso, tomorrow morning you shall know everything. Early in the morning shall I tell-a you my secret. That will be my Christmas present to you.  TOMASSO. All right. I'll wait. Oh, see, Anita, the moon is coming up. (_Points to L._) Just like-a big, round-a silver ball.  ANITA. Let us stay here and watch the moon, Tomasso.  TOMASSO. You'd better go and get your supper. Those leetla Dutch twins are eating everything on the table. I think they'd eat the table itself if it was-a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!  ANITA. I go. (_Crosses to door at R., then turns toward him_). It's a awful good-a secret, Tomasso. (_Laughs and runs out at R._)  TOMASSO (_looks off L._). Ah, the great, grand-a lady moon. She looks at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.  (_Simple violin solo by_ TOMASSO, _accompanied by hidden organ or piano. After he has been playing sometime, the other children come softly in from the R. and group around the stage. Note: If possible, get a boy for_ TOMASSO'S _part who can play the violin; if not, introduce a song at this point. \"Santa Lucia,\" found in most school collections, would prove effective either as a vocal solo or as a violin solo._)  BIDDY MARY. Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear ould Ireland where the River Shannon flows.  HULDA. What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy Mary?  MEENY. Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?  BIDDY MARY. We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.  PADDY MIKE. And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we have for all that. Instead of getting presents, we have the fun of giving presents--and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it is, to make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],["title","The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#8)"],["body"," other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give presents.  KLINKER. You can give me some if you want to.  SCHWILLIE. Und me also some.  BIDDY MARY. But where would we be getting presents out here in the middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're after having on Christmas Day.  PADDY MIKE. It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.  SERGIUS. In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and put a fine linen cloth on it. (_Produces white lace-edged cloth._) Here is the cloth, but we have no window.  HULDA. Here, use this box as a table. (_Indicates a large box at rear C._) Now, let us put the cloth on, so! (HULDA _and_ SERGIUS _put cloth on the box._)  BIDDY MARY. The night before Christmas we always put a big candle, all gay with ribbons, in the window to welcome the Christ child.  PADDY MIKE. Here is the candle. (_Places it on box at rear C._) Now I'll light it. (_Lights candle._)  TOMASSO. We do that also in Italy. And we put a leetla picture of the Christ child on the table. (_Puts colored picture of Madonna and Child back of the candle._)  BIDDY MARY. On Christmas Day it's the fine old tales we're after hearing in Ireland, all about the wonderful star that shone so bright that it turned night into day, and led the Wise Men all the way to where a little Babe in the manger lay.  PADDY MIKE. And all the angels sang above of peace on earth, good will and love.  BIDDY MARY.       The shepherds wandering on the hill,      Beheld the star and followed till      They saw the Child and heard the song,      The angels sang the whole night long.  SERGIUS. May the spirit of Christmas enter every heart tonight, making all the world one big, happy family, no rich, no poor, no high, no low, all brothers and sisters, all children of the Lord on high!  MEENY. Maybe good old Santa Claus will come after all. Vell, if he does I want to be ready for him. (_Produces two very large red stockings, made for the occasion._) Come, Yakob and Hans and Mieze, let us hang up our stockings here under the burning candle. (_They hang up the four pair of stockings._)  NEELDA (_places a wreath of holly on the table_). Christ was born on the Christmas Day, wreathe the holly, twine the bay! Light and Life and Joy is He, the Babe, the Son, the Holy One of Mary!  TOMASSO. Meeny and Yakob and Hans and leetla Mieze have hung up their stockings for the good-a Saint Nicholas, but in Italy we set out our shoes, so! And we always get them full of presents. (_Places small pair of wooden shoes on table._)  MEENY. I like stockings much better than shoes already, because the stockings can stretch yet, und if they stretch real, real wide out maybe we can get a baby piano or a automobile in our stockings. Jah, stockings is mooch better als shoes.  HULDA. Here is my beautiful star. (_Produces tinsel star._) That will remind us of the Star of Bethlehem that led the three Wise Men across the hills and plains of Judea unto the little manger where, surrounded by cattle and oxen, amid the straw, the Lord of Heaven was born on Christmas Eve.  SCHWILLIE. Und all the angels sang, \"Peace on earth, good will to men,\" didn't they, Klinker?  KLINKER. Und all the shepherds heard them, and they followed the star and came to the manger to see the little Baby.  MEENY. Let us all sit down here in front of the candle and the star, and see if old Santa Claus has forgotten us already. It's almost time for him to be coming. (_All sit down._)  ALL (_sing_).       THE TIME IS NEAR.  [Music illustration:       1. The time is near, the time is near,      San-ta Claus will soon be here!      All the world is sweet-ly sleep-ing,      An-gels now their watch are keep-ing,      And the moon shines clear,      And the moon shines clear.       2. Be-fore the dawn, be-fore the dawn,      Saint Nick will have come and gone!      Now with pa-tience we'll a-wait him,      Hop-ing noth-ing may be-late him,      On his jour-ney long,      On his jour-ney long.]  HULDA. Oh, I do hope Santa Claus will come and visit us tonight. But of course he cannot go every place. Some children have to be left out.  KLINKER. Yes, that's so; but I hope it ain't us. Don't you, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Sure, I do. I wish old Santa would hurry up and come, 'cause the old Sandman is here already. I'm getting awful sleepy.  KLINKER. Me--I'm getting awful sleepy, too. (_Stretches and yawns._)  TOMASSO. I wonder what has become of Anita? She said she had a wonderful secret that was-a verra, verra grand.  MEENY. A secret, Tomasso? (_Goes to him._)  TOMASSO (_standing at C._). Yes, a great, beeg, grand-a secret.  BIDDY MARY (_goes to him and takes his L. arm_). Oh, what is it, Tomasso?  MEENY (_taking his R. arm_). Yes, Tomasso, tell us vot it is already.  BIDDY MARY (_turning_ TOMASSO _around to face her_). Sure, if there's anything on earth I _do_ love, it's a secret.  HULDA (_and the other girls, surrounding_ TOMASSO). Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.  MEENY (_pulling him around to face her_). Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.  TOMASSO (_hesitates_). Well, I----  BIDDY MARY (_pulling him around to face her_). Now, you tell _me_, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.  TOMASSO. Well, I----  MEENY (_pulls him around again_). If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.  BIDDY MARY (_pulls him back_). Neither do I.  HULDA. Neither do I.  MEENY. Neither do any of us.  KLINKER. I don't want to miss nothing neither.  SCHWILLIE. No, und I don't neither.  ALL. Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?  TOMASSO (_loudly_). It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.  ALL. Well, what is Anita's secret.  TOMASSO. She wouldn't tell me.  ALL (_turn away very much disappointed_). Oh!  TOMASSO. She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret. (_All sit or recline around the stage. Lower the lights._)  SERGIUS. It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.  KLINKER (_almost asleep_). Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.  BIDDY MARY (_at R._). Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.  SANO SAN. They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.  AH GOO. Allee samee hang mine. (SANO SAN _and_ AH GOO _each give their lanterns to_ SERGIUS, _who lights them and hangs them on the table. Note: Nails must be put in the table at R. and L. corners facing front for these lanterns._)  SERGIUS. I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. (_Reclines on floor._) Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.  TOMASSO (_yawns_). I wonder what has become of Anita?  HULDA (_stretches_). I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.  OTHERS. So are all of us.  BIDDY MARY. We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.  ALL (_sing sleepily_).       \"WE'RE ALL NODDIN'.\"  [Music illustration:       1. We are all nod-din', nid, nid nod-din',      We are all nod-din', and drop-ping off to sleep.      So see San-ta Claus we've all done our best,      [Transcriber's Note: probably should be \"To see\"]      But we're aw-ful-ly sleep-y, so we'll take a rest.       2. We are all nod-din', nid, nid nod-din',      We are all nod-din', and drop-ping off to sleep.      It's aw-ful-ly late, we'll no lon-ger de-lay,      But ride with the Sand-man, a-way and a-way.]  (ALL _are sound asleep. Stage is dark._)  KLINKER (_talking in his sleep_). Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.  SCHWILLIE (talking in his sleep). Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?  _Soft, mysterious music._ ANITA _dances in from R. She dances around the stage, keeping time to the music and bending over the little sleepers._  ANITA. Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! (_Goes to curtain at rear._) Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.  JACK FROST (_sticks his head out of the curtains_). Hello, what is it?  ANITA. It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.  JACK FROST (_coming down to her_). And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. (_Yawns._) I'm still awfully sleepy.  ANITA. I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.  JACK FROST. You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.  ANITA. The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?  JACK FROST. Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?  ANITA. Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?  JACK FROST. Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?  ANITA (_looking up and off at R._). No, I cannot see a single thing.  JACK FROST (_sees table at rear_). Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.  ANITA (_looking up and off R._). I can't see a thing.  JACK FROST. Here's a telescope. Look through that. (_Takes home-made telescope from his barrel._) Now do you see anything?  ANITA. Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the"]]]
