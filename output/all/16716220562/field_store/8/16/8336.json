He was educated at the College of Beauvais, at the great Jansenist school at Port Royal, and at the College d'Harcourt. He attracted notice by an ode written for the marriage of Louis XIV in 1660, and made his first really great dramatic success with his \"Andromaque.\" His tragic masterpieces include \"Britannicus,\" \"Berenice,\" \"Bajazet,\" \"Mithridate,\" \"Iphigenie,\" and \"Phaedre,\" all written between 1669 and 1677. Then for some years he gave up dramatic composition, disgusted by the intrigues of enemies who sought to injure his career by exalting above him an unworthy rival. In 1689 he resumed his work under the persuasion of Mme. de Maintenon, and produced \"Esther\" and \"Athalie,\" the latter ranking among his finest productions, although it did not receive public recognition until some time after his death in 1699. Besides his tragedies, Racine wrote one comedy, \"Les Plaideurs,\" four hymns of great beauty, and a history of Port Royal.  The external conventions of classical tragedy which had been established by Corneille, Racine did not attempt to modify. His study of the Greek tragedians and his own taste led him to submit willingly to the rigor and simplicity of form which were the fundamental marks of the classical ideal. It was in his treatment of character that he differed most from his predecessor; for whereas, as we have seen, Corneille represented his leading figures as heroically subduing passion by force of will, Racine represents his as driven by almost uncontrollable passion. Thus his creations appeal to the modern reader as more warmly human; their speech, if less exalted, is simpler and more natural; and he succeeds more brilliantly with his portraits of women than with those of men.  All these characteristics are exemplified in \"Phaedre,\" the tragedy of Racine which has made an appeal to the widest audience. To the legend as treated by Euripides, Racine added the love of Hippolytus for Aricia, and thus supplied a motive for Phaedra's jealousy, and at the same time he made the nurse instead of Phaedra the calumniator of his son to Theseus.      PHAEDRA     CHARACTERS       THESEUS, son of Aegeus and King of Athens.      PHAEDRA, wife of Theseus and Daughter of Minos and Pasiphae.      HIPPOLYTUS, son of Theseus and Antiope, Queen of the Amazons.      ARICIA, Princess of the Blood Royal of Athens.      OENONE, nurse of Phaedra.      THERAMENES, tutor of Hippolytus.      ISMENE, bosom friend of Aricia.      PANOPE, waiting-woman of Phaedra.      GUARDS.   The scene is laid at Troezen, a town of the Peloponnesus.     ACT I            SCENE I           HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES             HIPPOLYTUS           My mind is settled, dear Theramenes,           And I can stay no more in lovely Troezen.           In doubt that racks my soul with mortal anguish,           I grow ashamed of such long idleness.           Six months and more my father has been gone,           And what may have befallen one so dear           I know not, nor what corner of the earth           Hides him.            THERAMENES           And where, prince, will you look for him?           Already, to content your just alarm,           Have I not cross'd the seas on either side           Of Corinth, ask'd if aught were known of Theseus           Where Acheron is lost among the Shades,           Visited Elis, doubled Toenarus,           And sail'd into the sea that saw the fall           Of Icarus? Inspired with what new hope,           Under what favour'd skies think you to trace           His footsteps? Who knows if the King, your father,           Wishes the secret of his absence known?           Perchance, while we are trembling for his life,           The hero calmly plots some fresh intrigue,           And only waits till the deluded fair--            HIPPOLYTUS           Cease, dear Theramenes, respect the name           Of Theseus. Youthful errors have been left           Behind, and no unworthy obstacle           Detains him. Phaedra long has fix'd a heart           Inconstant once, nor need she fear a rival.           In seeking him I shall but do my duty,           And leave a place I dare no longer see.            THERAMENES           Indeed! When, prince, did you begin to dread           These peaceful haunts, so dear to happy childhood,           Where I have seen you oft prefer to stay,           Rather than meet the tumult and the pomp           Of Athens and the court? What danger shun you,           Or shall I say what grief?            HIPPOLYTUS           That happy time           Is gone, and all is changed, since to these shores           The gods sent Phaedra.            THERAMENES           I perceive the cause           Of your distress. It is the queen whose sight           Offends you. With a step-dame's spite she schemed           Your exile soon as she set eyes on you.           But if her hatred is not wholly vanish'd,           It has at least taken a milder aspect.           Besides, what danger can a dying woman,           One too who longs for death, bring on your head?           Can Phaedra, sick'ning of a dire disease           Of which she will not speak, weary of life           And of herself, form any plots against you?            HIPPOLYTUS           It is not her vain enmity I fear,           Another foe alarms Hippolytus.           I fly, it must be own'd, from young Aricia,           The sole survivor of an impious race.            THERAMENES           What! You become her persecutor too!           The gentle sister of the cruel sons           Of Pallas shared not in their perfidy;           Why should you hate such charming innocence?            HIPPOLYTUS           I should not need to fly, if it were hatred.            THERAMENES           May I, then, learn the meaning of your flight?           Is this the proud Hippolytus I see,           Than whom there breathed no fiercer foe to love           And to that yoke which Theseus has so oft           Endured? And can it be that Venus, scorn'd           So long, will justify your sire at last?           Has she, then, setting you with other mortals,           Forced e'en Hippolytus to offer incense           Before her? Can you love?            HIPPOLYTUS           Friend, ask me not.           You, who have known my heart from infancy           And all its feelings of disdainful pride,           Spare me the shame of disavowing all           That I profess'd. Born of an Amazon,           The wildness that you wonder at I suck'd           With mother's milk. When come to riper age,           Reason approved what Nature had implanted.           Sincerely bound to me by zealous service,           You told me then the story of my sire,           And know how oft, attentive to your voice,           I kindled when I heard his noble acts,           As you described him bringing consolation           To mortals for the absence of Alcides,           The highways clear'd of monsters and of robbers,           Procrustes, Cercyon, Sciro, Sinnis slain,           The Epidaurian giant's bones dispersed,           Crete reeking with the blood of Minotaur.           But when you told me of less glorious deeds,           Troth plighted here and there and everywhere,           Young Helen stolen from her home at Sparta,           And Periboea's tears in Salamis,           With many another trusting heart deceived           Whose very names have 'scaped his memory,           Forsaken Ariadne to the rocks           Complaining, last this Phaedra, bound to him           By better ties,--you know with what regret           I heard and urged you to cut short the tale,           Happy had I been able to erase           From my remembrance that unworthy part           Of such a splendid record. I, in turn,           Am I too made the slave of love, and brought           To stoop so low? The more contemptible           That no renown is mine such as exalts           The name of Theseus, that no monsters quell'd           Have given me a right to share his weakness.           And if my pride of heart must needs be humbled,           Aricia should have been the last to tame it.           Was I beside myself to have forgotten           Eternal barriers of separation           Between us? By my father's stern command           Her brethren's blood must ne'er be reinforced           By sons of hers; he dreads a single shoot           From stock so guilty, and would fain with her           Bury their name, that, even to the tomb           Content to be his ward, for her no torch           Of Hymen may be lit. Shall I espouse           Her rights against my sire, rashly provoke           His wrath, and launch upon a mad career--            THERAMENES           The gods, dear prince, if once your hour is come,           Care little for the reasons that should guide us.           Wishing to shut your eyes, Theseus unseals them;           His hatred, stirring a rebellious flame           Within you, lends his enemy new charms.           And, after all, why should a guiltless passion           Alarm you? Dare you not essay its sweetness,           But follow rather a fastidious scruple?           Fear you to stray where Hercules has wander'd?           What heart so stout that Venus has not vanquish'd?           Where would you be yourself, so long her foe,           Had your own mother, constant in her scorn           Of love, ne'er glowed with tenderness for Theseus?           What boots it to affect a pride you feel not?           Confess it, all is changed; for some time past           You have been seldom seen with wild delight           Urging the rapid car along the strand,           Or, skilful in the art that Neptune"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1977"],["title","Phaedra (#1)"],["body",",           Making th' unbroken steed obey the bit;           Less often have the woods return'd our shouts;           A secret burden on your spirits cast           Has dimm'd your eye. How can I doubt you love?           Vainly would you conceal the fatal wound.           Has not the fair Aricia touch'd your heart?            HIPPOLYTUS           Theramenes, I go to find my father.            THERAMENES           Will you not see the queen before you start,           My prince?            HIPPOLYTUS           That is my purpose: you can tell her.           Yes, I will see her; duty bids me do it.           But what new ill vexes her dear Oenone?              SCENE II           HIPPOLYTUS, OENONE, THERAMENES             OENONE           Alas, my lord, what grief was e'er like mine?           The queen has almost touch'd the gates of death.           Vainly close watch I keep by day and night,           E'en in my arms a secret malady           Slays her, and all her senses are disorder'd.           Weary yet restless from her couch she rises,           Pants for the outer air, but bids me see           That no one on her misery intrudes.           She comes.            HIPPOLYTUS           Enough. She shall not be disturb'd,           Nor be confronted with a face she hates.              SCENE III           PHAEDRA, OENONE             PHAEDRA           We have gone far enough. Stay, dear Oenone;           Strength fails me, and I needs must rest awhile.           My eyes are dazzled with this glaring light           So long unseen, my trembling knees refuse           Support. Ah me!            OENONE           Would Heaven that our tears           Might bring relief!            PHAEDRA           Ah, how these cumbrous gauds,           These veils oppress me! What officious hand           Has tied these knots, and gather'd o'er my brow           These clustering coils? How all conspires to add           To my distress!            OENONE           What is one moment wish'd,           The next, is irksome. Did you not just now,           Sick of inaction, bid us deck you out,           And, with your former energy recall'd,           Desire to go abroad, and see the light           Of day once more? You see it, and would fain           Be hidden from the sunshine that you sought.            PHAEDRA           Thou glorious author of a hapless race,           Whose daughter 'twas my mother's boast to be,           Who well may'st blush to see me in such plight,           For the last time I come to look on thee,           O Sun!            OENONE           What! Still are you in love with death?           Shall I ne'er see you, reconciled to life,           Forego these cruel accents of despair?            PHAEDRA           Would I were seated in the forest's shade!           When may I follow with delighted eye,           Thro' glorious dust flying in full career,           A chariot--            OENONE           Madam?            PHAEDRA           Have I lost my senses?           What said I? and where am I? Whither stray           Vain wishes? Ah! The gods have made me mad.           I blush, Oenone, and confusion covers           My face, for I have let you see too clearly           The shame of grief that, in my own despite,           O'erflows these eyes of mine.            OENONE           If you must blush,           Blush at a silence that inflames your woes.           Resisting all my care, deaf to my voice,           Will you have no compassion on yourself,           But let your life be ended in mid course?           What evil spell has drain'd its fountain dry?           Thrice have the shades of night obscured the heav'ns           Since sleep has enter'd thro' your eyes, and thrice           The dawn has chased the darkness thence, since food           Pass'd your wan lips, and you are faint and languid.           To what dread purpose is your heart inclined?           How dare you make attempts upon your life,           And so offend the gods who gave it you,           Prove false to Theseus and your marriage vows,           Ay, and betray your most unhappy children,           Bending their necks yourself beneath the yoke?           That day, be sure, which robs them of their mother,           Will give high hopes back to the stranger's son,           To that proud enemy of you and yours,           To whom an Amazon gave birth, I mean           Hippolytus--            PHAEDRA           Ye gods!            OENONE           Ah, this reproach           Moves you!            PHAEDRA           Unhappy woman, to what name           Gave your mouth utterance?            OENONE           Your wrath is just.           'Tis well that that ill-omen'd name can rouse           Such rage. Then live. Let love and duty urge           Their claims. Live, suffer not this son of Scythia,           Crushing your children 'neath his odious sway,           To rule the noble offspring of the gods,           The purest blood of Greece. Make no delay;           Each moment threatens death; quickly restore           Your shatter'd strength, while yet the torch of life           Holds out, and can be fann'd into a flame.            PHAEDRA           Too long have I endured its guilt and shame!            OENONE           Why? What remorse gnaws at your heart? What crime           Can have disturb'd you thus? Your hands are not           Polluted with the blood of innocence?            PHAEDRA           Thanks be to Heav'n, my hands are free from stain.           Would that my soul were innocent as they!            OENONE           What awful project have you then conceived,           Whereat your conscience should be still alarm'd?            PHAEDRA           Have I not said enough? Spare me the rest.           I die to save myself a full confession.            OENONE           Die then, and keep a silence so inhuman;           But seek some other hand to close your eyes.           Tho' but a spark of life remains within you,           My soul shall go before you to the Shades.           A thousand roads are always open thither;           Pain'd at your want of confidence, I'll choose           The shortest. Cruel one, when has my faith           Deceived you! Think how in my arms you lay           New born. For you, my country and my children           I have forsaken. Do you thus repay           My faithful service?            PHAEDRA           What do you expect           From words so bitter? Were I to break silence           Horror would freeze your blood.            OENONE           What can you say           To horrify me more than to behold           You die before my eyes?            PHAEDRA           When you shall know           My crime, my death will follow none the less,           But with the added stain of guilt.            OENONE           Dear Madam,           By all the tears that I have shed for you,           By these weak knees I clasp, relieve my mind           From torturing doubt.            PHAEDRA           It is your wish. Then rise.            OENONE           I hear you. Speak.            PHAEDRA           Heav'ns! How shall I begin?            OENONE           Dismiss vain fears, you wound me with distrust.            PHAEDRA           O fatal animosity of Venus!           Into what wild distractions did she cast           My mother!            OENONE           Be they blotted from remembrance,           And for all time to come buried in silence.            PHAEDRA           My sister Ariadne, by what love           Were you betray'd to death, on lonely shores           Forsaken!            OENONE           Madam, what deep-seated pain           Prompts these reproaches against all your kin?            PHAEDRA           It is the will of Venus, and I perish,           Last, most unhappy of a family           Where all were wretched.            OENONE           Do you love?            PHAEDRA           I feel           All its mad fever.            OENONE           Ah! For whom?            PHAEDRA           Hear now           The crowning horror. Yes, I love--my lips           Tremble to say his name.            OENONE           Whom?            PHAEDRA           Know you him,           Son of the Amazon, whom I've oppress'd           So long?            OENONE           Hippolytus? Great gods!            PHAEDRA           'Tis you           Have named him.            OENONE           All my blood within my veins           Seems frozen. O despair! O cursed race!           Ill-omen'd journey! Land of misery!           Why did we ever reach thy dangerous shores?            PHAEDRA           My wound is not so recent. Scarcely had I           Been bound to Theseus by the marriage yoke,           And happiness and peace seem'd well secured,           When Athens show'd me my proud enemy.           I look'd, alternately turn'd pale and blush'd           To see him, and my soul grew all distraught;           A mist obscured my vision, and my voice           Falter'd, my blood ran cold, then burn'd like fire;           Venus I felt in all my fever'd frame,           Whose fury had so many of my race           Pursued. With fervent vows I sought to shun           Her torments, built and deck'd for her a shrine,           And there, 'mid countless victims did I seek           The reason I had lost; but all for naught,           No remedy could cure the wounds of love!           In vain I offer'd incense on her altars;           When I invoked her name my heart adored           Hippolytus, before me constantly;           And when I made her altars smoke with victims,           'Twas for a god whose name I dared not utter.
