Yes, I see thee, there I see thee--hidden as thou think'st from sight,     In the rushes why conceal thee?--answer me, why speak'st thou not.     Wherefore now ungentle stay'st thou--like to one forsworn, aloof?     Wherefore wilt thou not approach me--to console me in my woe?     For myself I will not sorrow--nor for aught to me befalls.     Thou art all alone, my husband,--I will only mourn for thee.     How will't fare with thee, my Nala--thirsting, famished, faint with toil.     Nor beholding me await thee--underneath the trees at eve.\"     Then, in all her depth of anguish--with her trouble as on fire,     Hither, thither, went she weeping--all around she went and wailed.     Now springs up the desolate princess--now falls down in prostrate grief;     Now she pines in silent sorrow--now she shrieks and wails aloud.     So consumed with inward misery--ever sighing more and more,     Spake at length king Bhima's daughter--spake the still devoted wife:     \"He, by whose dire imprecation--Nala this dread suffering bears,     May he far surpass in suffering--all that Nala suffers now,     May the evil one, to evil--who the blameless Nala drives,     Smitten by a curse as fatal--live a dark unblessed life.\"     Thus her absent lord lamenting--that high-minded raja's queen,     Every-where her lord went seeking--in the satyr-haunted wood.[72]     Like a maniac, Bhima's daughter--wandered wailing here and there;     And \"alas! alas! my husband\"--every-where her cry was heard.     Her beyond all measure wailing--like the osprey screaming shrill,     Miserably still deploring--still renewing her lament.     Suddenly king Bhima's daughter--as she wandered near his lair,     Seized a huge gigantic serpent--in his raging famine fierce.     In the grasp of that fierce serpent--round about with terror girt,     Not herself she pities only--pities she Nishadha's king.     \"O my guardian, thus unguarded--in this savage forest seized,     Seized by this terrific serpent--wherefore art not thou at hand?     How will't be, when thou rememberest--once again thy faithful wife,     From this dreadful curse delivered--mind, and sense, and wealth returned?     When thou'rt weary, when thou'rt hungry--when thou'rt fainting with fatigue,     Who will soothe, O blameless Nala--all thy weariness, thy woe.\"       Then a huntsman as he wandered--in the forest jungle thick,     As he heard her thus bewailing--in his utmost haste drew near.     In the grasp when he beheld her--of that long-eyed serpent fell,     Instant did the nimble huntsman--rapidly as he came on,     Pierce that unresisting serpent--with a sharp and mortal shaft:     In her sight he slew that serpent--skill'd in slaughter of the chase.     Her released he from her peril--washed he then with water pure,     And with sylvan food refreshed her--and with soothing words address'd:     \"Who art thou that roam'st the forest--with the eyes of the gazelle;     How to this extreme of misery--noble lady, hast thou fallen?\"     Damayanti, by the huntsman--thus in soothing tone addressed,     All the story of her misery-told him, as it all befell;     Her, scant-clothed in half a garment--with soft swelling limbs and breast,     Form of youthful faultless beauty--and her fair and moonlike face,     And her eyes with brows dark arching--and her softly-melting speech,     Saw long time that wild beast hunter--kindled all his heart with love.     Then with winning voice that huntsman--bland beginning his discourse,     Fain with amorous speech would soothe her--she his dark intent perceived.     Damayanti, chaste and faithful,--soon as she his meaning knew,     In the transport of her anger--her indignant soul took fire.     In his wicked thought the dastard--her yet powerless to subdue,     On the unsubdued stood gazing--as like some bright flame she shone.     Damayanti, in her sorrow--of her realm, her lord bereft,     On the instant she found language--uttered loud her curse of wrath,[73]--     \"As my pure and constant spirit--swerves not from Nishadha's lord,     Instant so may this base hunter--lifeless fall upon the earth.\"     Scarce that single word was uttered--suddenly that hunter bold     Down upon the earth fell lifeless--like a lightning blasted tree.     BOOK XII.       Slain that savage wild-beast hunter--onward went the lotus-eyed,     Through the dread, and desert forest--ringing with the cricket's song;     Full of lions, pards, and tigers--stags, and buffalos, and bears,     Where all kinds of birds were flocking--and wild men and robbers dwelt.     Trees of every form and stature[74]--every foliage, every name;     Pregnant with rich mines of metal--many a mountain it enclosed,     Many a shady resonant arbour--many a deep and wondrous glen;     Many a lake, and pool, and river--birds and beasts of every shape.     She, in forms terrific round her--serpents, elves, and giants saw:[75]     Pools, and tanks of lucid water--and the shaggy tops of hills,     Flowing streams and headlong torrents--saw, and wondered at the sight.     And the princess of Vidarbha--gazed where in their countless herds,     Buffalos and bears were feeding--boars, and serpents of the wood.     Safe in virtue, bright in beauty--glorious and of high resolve,     Now alone, Vidarbha's daughter--wandering, her lost Nala sought.     Yet no fear king Bhima's daughter--for herself might deign to feel,     Travelling the dreary forest--only for her lord distressed;     Him she mourned, that noble princess--him in bitterest anguish wailed,     Every limb with sorrow trembling--stood she on a beetling rock;     \"Monarch, with broad chest capacious--monarch with the sinewy arm,     Me in this dread forest leaving--whither hast thou fled away?     Thou the holy Aswamedha--thou each sacrificial rite,     Hast performed, to me, me only--in thy holy faith thou'st failed.     That which thou, O best of husbands--in mine hearing hast declared,     Thy most solemn vow remember--call to mind thy plighted faith.     Of the swift-winged swans the language--uttered, monarch, by thy side,     That thyself, before my presence--didst renew, bethink thee well.     Thou the Vedas, thou the Angas--with the Upangas oft hast read,     Of each heaven-descended volume--one and simple is the truth.     Therefore, of thy foes the slayer!--reverence thou the sacred truth     Of thy solemn plighted promise--in my presence sworn so oft.     Am not I the loved so dearly--purely, sinlessly beloved;     In this dark and awful forest--wherefore dost thou not reply?     Here with monstrous jaws wide yawning--with his fierce and horrid form,     Gapes the forest king to slay me--and thou art not here to save.     None but I, thou'st said, for ever--none but I to thee am dear!     Make this oft-repeated language--make this oft-sworn promise true.     To thy queen bereft of reason--to thy weeping wife beloved,     Why repliest thou not--her only thou desir'st--she only thee.     Meagre, miserable, pallid--tainted with the dust and mire,     Scantly clad in half a garment--lone, with no protector near;     Like a large-eyed hind that wanders--separate from the wonted herd,     Thou regard'st me not, thus weeping--oh thou tamer of thy foes.     Mighty king, a lonely wanderer--in this vast and trackless wood,     Damayanti, I address thee--wherefore answerest not my voice?     Nobly born, and nobly minded--beautiful in every limb,     Do I not e'en now behold thee--in this mountain, first of men,     In this lion-haunted forest--in this tiger-howling wood,     Lying down or seated, standing--or in majesty and might     Moving, do I not behold thee--the enhancer of my woe?     Who shall I address, afflicted--wasted by my grief away;     'Hast thou haply seen my Nala--in the solitary wood?'     Who this day will show the monarch--wandering in the forest depth,     Beautiful and royal-minded--conqueror of an host of foes!     'Him thou seek'st with eyes of lotus--Nala, sovereign of men--     Lo, he's here!' whose voice of music--may I hear thus sweetly speak?     Lo, with fourfold tusks before me--and with wide and gaping jaws,     Stands the forest king, the tiger--I approach him without fear.     Of the beasts art thou the monarch--all this forest thy domain,     For the daughter of Vidarbha--Damayanti, know thou me,     Consort of Nishadha's sovereign--Nala, slayer of his foes--     Seeking here my exile husband--lonely, wretched, sorrow-driven,     Thou, O king of beasts, console me--if my Nala thou hast seen;     Or, O lord of all the forest--Nala if thou canst not show,     Best of savage beasts, devour me--from my misery set me free.     Hearing thus my lamentation-now does that fell king of beasts     Go towards the crystal river--flowing downward to the sea.'--     To this mountain then the holy--crowned with many a lofty peak,     In its soul-exalting splendour--rising, many-hued, to heaven;     Full within of precious metal--rich with many a glowing gem,     Rising o'er the spreading forest--like a banner broad and high,     Ranged by elephants and lions--tigers, bears, and boars, and stags;     And of many birds the voices--sweetly sound o'er all its cliffs;     All the trees of richest foliage[76]--all the trees of stateliest height,     All the flowers and golden fruitage--on its crested summits wave,     Down its peaks in many a streamlet--dip the water-birds their wings:     This, the monarch of all mountains--ask I of the king of men;     'O, all-honoured Prince of Mountains, with thy heaven-ward soaring peaks,     Refuge of the lost, most noble--thee, O Mountain, I salute;     I salute thee, lowly bowing--I, the daughter of a king;     Of a king the royal consort--of a king's son I the bride.

Of Vidarbha the protector--conqueror of a host of foes;     Know me of that king the daughter--lowly thus approaching thee.     In Nishadha, mighty Mountain! dwelt the father of my lord.     High the name he won, the illustrious--Virasena was he called.     Of this king the son, the hero--prosperous and truly brave,     He who rules his father's kingdom--by hereditary right,     Slayer of his foes, dark Nala--Punyasloka is he called;     Holy, Veda read, and eloquent--soma quaffing, fire adoring,[78][79]     Sacrificer, liberal giver--warrior, in all points a king,--     Of this monarch, best of mountains--know, the wife before thee stands.     Fallen from bliss, bereft of husband--unprotected, sorrow-doomed,     Seeking every where her husband--him the best of noblest men.     Best of mountains, heaven-upsoaring--with thy hundred stately peaks,     Hast thou seen the kingly Nala--in this dark and awful wood:     Like the elephant in courage--wise, impetuous, with long arms,     Valiant, and of truth unquestioned--my heroic, glorious lord;     Hast thou seen Nishadha's sovereign--mighty Nala hast thou seen?     Why repliest thou not, oh Mountain--sorrowing, lonely, and distressed,     With thy voice why not console me--as thine own afflicted child?       Hero, mighty, strong in duty--true of promise, lord of earth,     If thou art within the forest--show thee in thy proper form.     When so eloquently deep-toned--like the sound of some dark cloud,     Shall I hear thy voice, oh Nala!--sweet as the amrita draught,[80]     Saying, 'daughter of Vidarbha!'--with distinct, with blessed sound,     Musical as holy Veda--rich, and soothing all my pain;     Thus console me, trembling, fainting--thou, oh virtue-loving king!\"       To the holiest of mountains--spake the daughter of the king.     Damayanti then set forward--toward the region of the north.     Three days long, three nights she wandered--then that noble woman saw,     The unrivalled wood of hermits--like to a celestial grove.     To the ancient famous hermits[81]--equal was that sacred crew;     Self-denying, strict in diet[82]--temperate, and undefiled;     Water-drinking, air inhaling--and the leaves their simple food;     Mortified, for ever blessed--seeking the right way to heaven;     Bark for vests and skins for raiment--wore those hermits, sense-subdued.     She beheld the pleasant circle--of those hermits' lonely cells;     Round them flocks of beasts were grazing--wantoned there the monkey tribes.     When she saw those holy dwellings--all her courage was revived.     Lovely browed, and lovely tressed--lovely bosom'd, lovely lipp'd,[83]     In her brightness, in her glory--with her large dark beauteous eyes,     Entered she those hermit dwellings--wife of Virasena's son;     Pearl of women, ever blessed-Damayanti the devout,     She those holy men saluting--stood with modest form half bent.     \"Hail, and welcome!\" thus those hermits--instant with one voice exclaimed.     And those sacred men no sooner--had the fitting homage paid,     \"Take thy seat,\" they said, \"oh lady[84]--and command what we must do.\"     Thus replied the slender waisted--\"Blessed are ye, holy men.     In your sacred fires, your worship[85]--blameless, with your beasts and         birds.[86]     Doth the grace of heaven attend you--in your duties, in your deeds?\"     Answered they, \"The grace of heaven--ever blesses all our deeds.     But say thou, of form so beauteous--who thou art, and what thou would'st?     As thy noble form we gaze on--on thy brightness as we gaze,     In amaze we stand and wonder--cheer thee up, and mourn no more.     Of the wood art thou the goddess--or the mountain goddess thou;     Or the goddess of the river?--Blessed Spirit, speak the truth.     Nor the sylvan goddess am I,\"--to the Wise she thus replied;     \"Neither of the mountain, Brahmins--nor the river nymph am I.     Know me but a mortal being--O, ye rich in holiness!     All my tale at length, I'll tell ye--if meet audience ye will give.     In Vidarbha, mighty guardian--Bhima, dwells the lord of earth;     Of that noble king the daughter--twice-born Sages, know ye me.[87]     And the monarch of Nishadha--Nala named, the great in fame;     Brave in battle, conqueror, prudent--is my lord, the peasants' king;     To the gods devout in worship--friendly to the Brahmin race,     Of Nishadha's race the guardian--great in glory, great in might,     True in word, and skilled in duty--and the slayer of his foes.     Pious, heaven-devoted, prosperous--conqueror of hostile towns;     Nala named, the best of sovereigns--splendid as the king of gods.     Know that large-eyed chief, my husband--like the full-orbed moon his face,     Giver he of costly offerings--deep in th' holy volumes read;     Slayer of his foes in battle--glorious as the sun and moon.     He to some most evil minded--unrespected, wicked men,     After many a challenge, studious--he of virtue and of truth,     To these skilful gamesters, fraudful--lost his kingdom and his wealth.     Know ye me the hapless consort--of that noble king of kings,     Damayanti, so they name me--yearning for my husband's sight.     I through forests, over mountains--stagnant marsh and river broad,     Lake with wide pellucid surface--through the long and trackless wood,     Ever seeking for my husband--Nala, skilful in the fight.     Mighty in the use of weapons--wander desolate and sad.     Tell me, to this pleasant sojourn--sacred to these holy men,     Hath he come, the royal Nala?--hath Nishadha's monarch come?     For whose sake through ways all trackless--terrible, have I set forth,     In this drear, appalling forest--where the lynx and tiger range,     If I see not noble Nala--ere few days, few nights are o'er,     I to happiness will join me--from this mortal frame set free.     Reft of him, my princely husband--what have I to do with life--     How endure existence longer--for my husband thus distressed.\"     To the lady thus complaining--lonely in the savage wood,     Answered thus those holy hermits--spake the gifted seers the truth:--     \"There will be a time hereafter--beautiful, the time will come,     Through devotion now we see him[88]--and thou too wilt see him soon;     That good monarch of Nishadha--Nala, slayer of his foes;     That dispenser of strict justice--Bhima's daughter! free from grief,     From all sin released, thou'lt see him--glittering in his royal gems,     Governing that noble city--o'er his enemies supreme.     To his foemen causing terror--to his friends allaying grief,     Thou, oh noble, shalt thy husband--see, that king of noble race.\"     To the much-loved wife of Nala--to the princess speaking thus,     Vanished then those holy hermits--with their sacred fires, their cells.     As she gazed upon the wonder--wrapt in mute amaze she stood;     Damayanti, fair-limbed princess--wife of Virasena's son;     \"Have I only seen a vision--what hath been this wondrous chance?     Where are all those holy hermits--where the circle of their cells?     Where that pure and pleasant river--haunted by the dipping birds?     Where those trees with grateful umbrage--with their pendant fruits and         flowers?\"     Long within her heart she pondered--Damayanti with sweet smile,     For her lord, to grief abandoned--miserable, pale of hue;     To another region passed she--there with voice by weeping choked,     Mourns she, till with eyes o'erflowing--an Asoca tree she saw.     Best of trees, the Asoca blooming[89]--in the forest she approached,     Gemmed all o'er with glowing fruitage--vocal with the songs of birds.       \"Ah, behold amid the forest--flourishes this happy tree,     With its leafy garlands radiant--as the joyous mountain king.     O thou tree with pleasant aspect--from my sorrow set me free.     Vitasoca, hast thou seen him--hast the fearless raja seen,     Nala, of his foes the slayer--Damayanti's lord beloved?     Hast thou seen Nishadha's monarch--hast thou seen mine only love,     Clad in half a single garment--with his soft and delicate skin;     Hast thou seen th' afflicted hero--wandering in the forest lone.     That I may depart ungrieving--fair Asoca, answer me.     Truly be thou named Asoca[90]--as the extinguisher of grief.\"     Thus in her o'erpowering anguish--moved she round the Asoca tree.     Then she went her way in sadness--to another region dread.     Many a tree she stood and gazed on--many a river passed she o'er;     Passed she many a pleasant mountain--many a wild deer, many a bird;     Many a hill and many a cavern--many a bright and wondrous stream,     Saw king Bhima's wandering daughter--as she sought her husband lost.       Long she roamed her weary journey--Damayanti with sweet smile,     Lo, a caravan of merchants--elephants, and steeds, and cars,     And beyond, a pleasant river--with its waters cool and clear.     'Twas a quiet stream, and waveless--girt about with spreading canes;     There the cuckoo, there the osprey--there the red-geese clamouring stood;     Swarmed the turtles, fish and serpents--there rose many a stately isle.       When she saw that numerous concourse--Nala's once all-glorious wife,     Entered she, the slender-waisted--in the midst of all the host;     Maniac-like in form and feature--and in half a garment clad,     Thin and pallid, travel-tainted--matted all her locks with dust.     As they all beheld her standing--some in terror fled away;     Some stood still in speechless wonder--others raised their voice and cried;     Mocked her some with cruel tauntings--others spake reproachful words;     Others looked on her with pity--and"]]]
