Suddenly he stopped in front of me and threw down his arms. \"Mary,\" he said, \"if Mother were at home, she _would_ despise us for selfishness, wouldn't she just?\"  \"I don't think it's selfish to want spare things for our gardens, if she gives us leave,\" said I.  \"I'm not thinking of that,\" said Arthur; \"and you're not selfish, you never are; but she would despise me, and Adela, and Harry, because we've taken your game, and got our parts, and you've made that preposterous bonnet for Adela to be the Weeding Woman in--much she'll weed!--\"  \"I _shall_ weed,\" said Adela.  \"Oh, yes! You'll weed,--Groundsel!--and leave Mary to get up the docks and dandelions, and clear away the heap. But, never mind. Here we've taken Mary's game, and she hasn't even got a part.\"  \"Yes,\" said I, \"I have; I have got a capital part. I have only to think of a name.\"  \"How shall you be dressed?\" asked Adela.  \"I don't know yet,\" said I. \"I have only just thought of the part.\"  \"Are you sure it's a good-enough one?\" asked Harry, with a grave and remorseful air; \"because, if not, you must take Francis le Vean. Girls are called Frances sometimes.\"  I explained, and I read aloud the bit that had struck my fancy.  Arthur got restless half-way through, and took out the Book of Paradise. His letter was on his mind. But Adela was truly delighted.  \"Oh, Mary,\" she said. \"It is lovely. And it just suits you. It suits you much better than being a Queen.\"  \"Much better,\" said I.  \"You'll be exactly the reverse of me,\" said Harry. \"When I'm digging up, you'll be putting in.\"  \"Mary,\" said Arthur, from the corner where he was sitting with the Book of Paradise in his lap, \"what have you put a mark in the place about honeysuckle for?\"  \"Oh, only because I was just reading there when James brought the letters.\"  \"John Parkinson can't have been quite so nice a man as Alphonse Karr,\" said Adela; \"not so unselfish. He took care of the Queen's Gardens, but he didn't think of making the lanes and hedges nice for poor wayfarers.\"  I was in the rocking-chair, and I rocked harder to shake up something that was coming into my head. Then I remembered.  \"Yes, Adela, he did--a little. He wouldn't root up the honeysuckle out of the hedges (and I suppose he wouldn't let his root-gatherers grub it up, either); he didn't put it in the Queen's Gardens, but left it wild outside--\"  \"To serve their senses that travel by it, or have no garden,\" interrupted Arthur, reading from the book, \"and, oh, Mary! that reminds me--_travel--travellers._ I've got a name for your part just coming into my head. But it dodges out again like a wire-worm through a three-pronged fork. _Travel--traveller--travellers_--what's the common name for the--oh, dear! the what's his name that scrambles about in the hedges. A flower--you know?\"  \"Deadly Nightshade?\" said Harry.  \"Deadly fiddlestick!--\"  \"Bryony?\" I suggested.  \"Oh, no; it begins with C.\"  \"Clematis?\" said Adela.  \"Clematis. Right you are, Adela. And the common name for Clematis is Traveller's Joy. And that's the name for you, Mary, because you're going to serve their senses that travel by hedges and ditches and perhaps have no garden.\"  \"Traveller's Joy,\" said Harry. \"Hooray!\"  \"Hooray!\" said Adela, and she waved the Weeding Woman's bonnet.  It was a charming name, but it was too good for me, and I said so.  Arthur jumped on the rockers, and rocked me to stop my talking. When I was far back, he took the point of my chin in his two hands and lifted up my cheeks to be kissed, saying in his very kindest way, \"It's not a bit too good for you--it's you all over.\"  Then he jumped off as suddenly as he had jumped on, and as I went back with a bounce he cried, \"Oh, Mary! give me back that letter. I must put another postscript and another puzzlewig. 'P.P.S.--Excellent Majesty: Mary will still be our Little Mother on all common occasions, as you wished, but in the Earthly Paradise we call her Traveller's Joy.'\"     CHAPTER VII.   There are two or three reasons why the part of Traveller's Joy suited me very well. In the first place it required a good deal of trouble, and I like taking trouble. Then John was willing to let me do many things he would not have allowed the others to do, because he could trust me to be careful and to mind what he said.  On each side of the long walk in the kitchen garden there are flowers between you and the vegetables, herbaceous borders, with nice big clumps of things that have suckers, and off-shoots and seedlings at their feet.  \"The Long Walk's the place to steal from if I wasn't an _honest_ Root-gatherer,\" said Harry.  John had lovely poppies there that summer. When I read about the poppies Alphonse Karr sowed in the wild nooks of his native country, it made me think of John's French poppies, and paeony poppies, and ranunculus poppies, and carnation poppies, some very large, some quite small, some round and neat, some full and ragged like Japanese chrysanthemums, but all of such beautiful shades of red, rose, crimson, pink, pale blush, and white, that if they had but smelt like carnations instead of smelling like laudanum when you have the toothache, they would have been quite perfect.  In one way they are nicer than carnations. They have such lots of seed, and it is so easy to get. I asked John to let me have some of the heads. He could not possibly want them all, for each head has enough in it to sow two or three yards of a border. He said I might have what seeds I liked, if I used scissors, and did not drag things out of the ground by pulling. But I was not to let the young gentlemen go seed gathering. \"Boys be so destructive,\" John said.  After a time, however, I persuaded him to let Harry transplant seedlings of the things that sow themselves and come up in the autumn, if they came up a certain distance from the parent plants. Harry got a lot of things for our Paradise in this way; indeed, he would not have got much otherwise, except wild flowers; and, as he said, \"How can I be your Honest Root-gatherer if I mayn't gather anything up by the roots?\"  I can't help laughing sometimes to think of the morning when he left off being our Honest Root-gatherer. He did look so funny, and so like Chris.  A day or two before, the Scotch Gardener had brought Saxon to see us, and a new kind of mouldiness that had got into his grape vines to show to John.  He was very cross with Saxon for walking on my garden. (And I am sure I quite forgave him, for I am so fond of him, and he knew no better, poor dear!) But, though he kicked Saxon, the Scotch Gardener was kind to us. He told us that the reason our gardens do not do so well as the big garden, and that my _Jules Margottin_ has not such big roses as John's _Jules Margottin_ is because we have never renewed the soil.  Arthur and Harry got very much excited about this. They made the Scotch Gardener tell them what good soil ought to be made of, and all the rest of the day they talked of nothing but _compost_. Indeed Arthur would come into my room and talk about compost after I had gone to bed.  Father's farming man was always much more good-natured to us than John ever was. He would give us anything we wanted. Warm milk when the cows were milked, or sweet-pea sticks, or bran to stuff the dolls' pillows. I've known him take his hedging-bill, in his dinner-hour, and cut fuel for our beacon-fire, when we were playing at a French Invasion. Nothing could be kinder.  Perhaps we do not tease him so much as we tease John. But when I say that, Arthur says, \"Now, Mary, that's just how you explain away things. The real difference between John and Michael is, that Michael is good-natured and John is not. Catch John showing me the duck's nest by the pond, or letting you into the cow-house to kiss the new calf between the eyes--if he were farm man instead of gardener!\"  And the night Arthur sat in my room, talking about compost, he said, \"I shall get some good stuff out of Michael, I know; and Harry and I see our way to road-scrapings if we can't get sand; and we mean to take precious good care John doesn't have all the old leaves to himself. It's the top-spit that puzzles us, and loam is the most important thing of all.\"  \"What is top-spit?\" I asked.  \"It's the earth you get when you dig up squares of grass out of a field like the paddock. The new earth that's just underneath. I expect John got a lot when he turfed that new piece by the pond, but I don't believe he'd spare us a flower-pot full to save his life.\"  \"Don't quarrel with John, Arthur. It's no good.\"  \"I won't quarrel with him if he behaves himself,\" said Arthur, \"but we mean to have some top-spit somehow.\"  \"If you aggravate him he'll only complain of us to Father.\"  \"I know,\" said Arthur hotly, \"and beastly mean of him, too, when he knows what Father is about this sort of thing.\"  \"I know it's mean. But what's the good of fighting when you'll only get the worst of it?\"  \"Why to show that you're in the right, and that you know you are,\" said Arthur. \"Good-night, Mary. We'll have a compost heap of our own this autumn, mark my words.\"  Next day, in spite of my remonstrances, Arthur and Harry came to open war with John, and loudly and long did they rehearse their grievances, when we were out of Father's hearing.  \"Have we ever swept our own walks, except that once, long ago, when the German women came round with threepenny brooms?\" asked Arthur, throwing out his right arm, as if he were making a speech. \"And think of all the years John has been getting leaf mould for himself out of our copper beech leaves, and now refuses us a barrow-load of loam!\"  The next morning but one Harry was late for breakfast, and then it seemed that he was not dressing he had gone out,--very early, one of the servants said. It frightened me, and I went out to look for him.  When I came upon him in our gardens, it was he who was frightened.  \"Oh, dear,\" he exclaimed, \"I thought you were John.\"  I have often"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19644"],["title","Mary's Meadow, and Other Tales of Fields and Flowers (#7)"],["body"," Harry dirty--very dirty,--but from the mud on his boots to the marks on his face where he had pushed the hair out of his eyes with earthy fingers, I never saw him quite so grubby before. And if there had been a clean place left in any part of his clothes well away from the ground, that spot must have been soiled by a huge and very dirty sack, under the weight of which his poor little shoulders were bent nearly to his knees.  \"What are you doing, Honest Root-gatherer?\" I asked; \"are you turning yourself into a hump-backed dwarf?\"  \"I'm not honest, and I'm not a Root-gatherer just now,\" said Harry, when he had got breath after setting down his load. He spoke shyly and a little surlily, like Chris when he is in mischief.  \"Harry, what's that?\"  \"It's a sack I borrowed from Michael. It won't hurt it, it's had mangel-wurzels in already.\"  \"What have you got in it now? It looks dreadfully heavy.\"  \"It _is_ heavy, I can tell you,\" said Harry, with one more rub of his dirty fingers over his face.  \"You look half dead. What is it?\"  \"It's top-spit;\" and Harry began to discharge his load on to the walk.  \"Oh, Harry; where did you get it?\"  \"Out of the paddock. I've been digging up turfs and getting this out, and putting the turfs back, and stamping them down not to show, ever since six o'clock. It _was_ hard work; and I was so afraid of John coming. Mary, you won't tell tales?\"  \"No, Harry. But I don't think you ought to have taken it without Mother's leave.\"  \"I don't think you can call it stealing,\" said Harry. \"Fields are a kind of wild places anyhow, and the paddock belongs to Father, and it certainly doesn't belong to John.\"  \"No,\" said I, doubtfully.  \"I won't get any more; it's dreadfully hard work,\" said Harry, but as he shook the sack out and folded it up, he added (in rather a satisfied tone), \"I've got a good deal.\"  I helped him to wash himself for breakfast, and half-way through he suddenly smiled and said, \"John Parkinson will be glad when he sees _you-know-what_, Mary, whatever the other John thinks of it.\"  But Harry did not cut any more turfs without leave, for he told me that he had a horrid dream that night of waking up in prison with a warder looking at him through a hole in the door of his cell, and finding out that he was in penal servitude for stealing top-spit from the bottom of the paddock, and Father would not take him out of prison, and that Mother did not know about it.  However, he and Arthur made a lot of compost. They said we couldn't possibly have a Paradise without it.  It made them very impatient. We always want the spring and summer and autumn and winter to get along faster than they do. But this year Arthur and Harry were very impatient with summer.  They were nearly caught one day by Father coming home just as they had got through the gates with Michael's old sack full of road-scrapings, instead of sand (we have not any sand growing near us, and silver sand is rather dear), but we did get leaves together and stacked them to rot into leaf mould.  Leaf mould is splendid stuff, but it takes a long time for the leaves to get mouldy, and it takes a great many too. Arthur is rather impatient, and he used to say--\"I never saw leaves stick on to branches in such a way. I mean to get into some of these old trees and give them a good shaking to remind them what time of year it is. If I don't we shan't have anything like enough leaves for our compost.\"     CHAPTER VIII.   Mother was very much surprised by Arthur's letter, but not so much puzzled as he expected. She knew Parkinson's _Paradisus_ quite well, and only wrote to me to ask, \"What are the boys after with the old books? Does your Father know?\"  But when I told her that he had given us leave to be in the library, and that we took great care of the books, and how much we enjoyed the ones about gardening, and all that we were going to do, she was very kind indeed, and promised to put on a blue dress and lace ruffles and be Queen of our Earthly Paradise as soon as she came home.  When she did come home she was much better, and so was Chris. He was delighted to be our Dwarf, but he wanted to have a hump, and he would have such a big one that it would not keep in its place, and kept slipping under his arm and into all sorts of queer positions.  Not one of us enjoyed our new game more than Chris did, and he was always teasing me to tell him the story I had told the others, and to read out the names of the flowers which \"the real Queen\" had in her \"real paradise.\" He made Mother promise to try to get him a bulb of the real Dwarf Daffodil as his next birthday present, to put in his own garden.  \"And I'll give you some compost,\" said Arthur. \"It'll be ever so much better than a stupid book with 'stuff' in it.\"  Chris did seem much stronger. He had colour in his cheeks, and his head did not look so large. But he seemed to puzzle over things in it as much as ever, and he was just as odd and quaint.  One warm day I had taken the _Tour round my Garden_ and was sitting near the bush in the little wood behind our house, when Chris came after me with a Japanese fan in his hand, and sat down cross-legged at my feet. As I was reading, and Mother has taught us not to interrupt people when they are reading, he said nothing, but there he sat.  \"What is it, Chris?\" said I.  \"I am discontented,\" said Chris.  \"I'm very sorry,\" said I.  \"I don't think I'm selfish, particularly, but I'm discontented.\"  \"What about?\"  \"Oh, Mary, I do wish I had not been away when you invented Paradise, then I should have had a name in the game.\"  \"You've got a name, Chris. You're the Dwarf.\"  \"Ah, but what was the Dwarf's name?\"  \"I don't know,\" I admitted.  \"No; that's just it. I've only one name, and Arthur and Harry have two. Arthur is a Pothecary\" (Chris could never be induced to accept Apothecary as one word), \"and he's John Parkinson as well. Harry is Honest Root-gatherer, and he is Francis le Vean. If I'd not been away I should have had two names.\"  \"You can easily have two names,\" said I. \"We'll call the Dwarf Thomas Brown.\"  Chris shook his big head.  \"No, no. That wasn't his name; I know it wasn't. It's only stuff. I want another name out of the old book.\"  I dared not tell him that the Dwarf was not in the old book. I said:  \"My dear Chris, you really are discontented; we can't all have double names. Adela has only one name, she is Weeding Woman and nothing else; and I have only one name, I'm Traveller's Joy, and that's all.\"  \"But you and Adela are girls,\" said Chris, complacently: \"The boys have two names.\"  I suppressed some resentment, for Christopher's eyes were beginning to look weary, and said:  \"Shall I read to you for a bit?\"  \"No, don't read. Tell me things out of the old book. Tell me about the Queen's flowers. Don't tell me about daffodils, they make me think what a long way off my birthday is, and I'm quite discontented enough.\"  And Chris sighed, and lay down on the grass, with one arm under his head, and his fan in his hand; and, as well as I could remember, I told him all about the different varieties of Cowslips, down to the Franticke, or Foolish Cowslip, and he became quite happy.  Dear Father is rather short-sighted, but he can hold a round glass in his eye without cutting himself. It was the other eye which was next to Chris at prayers the following morning; but he saw his legs, and the servants had hardly got out of the hall before he shouted, \"Pull up your stockings, Chris!\"--and then to Mother, \"Why do you keep that sloven of a girl Bessy, if she can't dress the children decently? But I can't conceive what made you put that child into knickerbockers, he can't keep his stockings up.\"  \"Yes, I can,\" said Christopher, calmly, looking at his legs.  \"Then what have you got 'em down for?\" shouted Father.  \"They're not all down,\" said Chris, his head still bent over his knees, till I began to fear he would have a fit.  \"One of 'em is, anyhow. I saw it at prayers. Pull it up.\"  \"Two of them are,\" said Christopher, never lifting his admiring gaze from his stockings. \"Two of them are down, and two of them are up, quite up, quite tidy.\"  Dear Father rubbed his glass and put it back into his eye.  \"Why, how many stockings have you got on?\"  \"Four,\" said Chris, smiling serenely at his legs; \"and it isn't Bessy's fault. I put 'em all on myself, every one of them.\"  At this minute James brought in the papers, and Father only laughed, and said, \"I never saw such a chap,\" and began to read. He is very fond of Christopher, and Chris is never afraid of him.  I was going out of the room, and Chris followed me into the hall, and drew my attention to his legs, which were clothed in four stockings; one pair, as he said, being drawn tidily up over his knees, the other pair turned down with some neatness in folds a little above his ankles.  \"Mary,\" he said, \"I'm contented now.\"  \"I'm very glad, Chris. But do leave off staring at your legs. All the blood will run into your head.\"  \"I wish things wouldn't always get into _my_ head, and nobody else's,\" said Chris, peevishly, as he raised it; but when he looked back at his stockings, they seemed to comfort him again.  \"Mary, I've found another name for myself.\"  \"Dear Chris! I'm so glad.\"  \"It's a real one, out of the old book. I thought of it entirely by myself.\"  \"Good Dwarf. What is your name?\"  \"_Hose-in-Hose_,\" said Christopher, still smiling down upon his legs.     CHAPTER IX.   Alas for the hose-in-hose!  I laughed over Christopher and his double stockings, and I danced for joy when Bessy's aunt told me that she had got me a fine lot of roots of double cowslips. I never guessed what misery I was about to suffer, because of the hose-in-hose.  I had almost forgotten that Bessy's aunt knew double cowslips. After I became Traveller's Joy I was so busy with wayside planting that I had thought less of my own garden than usual, and had allowed Arthur to do what he liked with it as part of the Earthly Paradise (and he was"]]]
