I breathed once more, Oenone; in his absence           My days flow'd on less troubled than before,           And innocent. Submissive to my husband,           I hid my grief, and of our fatal marriage           Cherish'd the fruits. Vain caution! Cruel Fate!           Brought hither by my spouse himself, I saw           Again the enemy whom I had banish'd,           And the old wound too quickly bled afresh.           No longer is it love hid in my heart,           But Venus in her might seizing her prey.           I have conceived just terror for my crime;           I hate my life, and hold my love in horror.           Dying I wish'd to keep my fame unsullied,           And bury in the grave a guilty passion;           But I have been unable to withstand           Tears and entreaties, I have told you all;           Content, if only, as my end draws near,           You do not vex me with unjust reproaches,           Nor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death           The last faint lingering sparks of vital breath.              SCENE IV           PHAEDRA, OENONE, PANOPE             PANOPE           Fain would I hide from you tidings so sad,           But 'tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.           The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,           And you are last to hear of this disaster.            OENONE           What say you, Panope?            PANOPE           The queen, deceived           By a vain trust in Heav'n, begs safe return           For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son           Learns of his death from vessels that are now           In port.            PHAEDRA           Ye gods!            PANOPE           Divided counsels sway           The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,           Your child, for master; others, disregarding           The laws, dare to support the stranger's son.           'Tis even said that a presumptuous faction           Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.           I deem'd it right to warn you of this danger.           Hippolytus already is prepared           To start, and should he show himself at Athens,           'Tis to be fear'd the fickle crowd will all           Follow his lead.            OENONE           Enough. The queen, who hears you,           By no means will neglect this timely warning.              SCENE V           PHAEDRA, OENONE             OENONE           Dear lady, I had almost ceased to urge           The wish that you should live, thinking to follow           My mistress to the tomb, from which my voice           Had fail'd to turn you; but this new misfortune           Alters the aspect of affairs, and prompts           Fresh measures. Madam, Theseus is no more,           You must supply his place. He leaves a son,           A slave, if you should die, but, if you live,           A King. On whom has he to lean but you?           No hand but yours will dry his tears. Then live           For him, or else the tears of innocence           Will move the gods, his ancestors, to wrath           Against his mother. Live, your guilt is gone,           No blame attaches to your passion now.           The King's decease has freed you from the bonds           That made the crime and horror of your love.           Hippolytus no longer need be dreaded,           Him you may see henceforth without reproach.           It may be, that, convinced of your aversion,           He means to head the rebels. Undeceive him,           Soften his callous heart, and bend his pride.           King of this fertile land, in Troezen here           His portion lies; but as he knows, the laws           Give to your son the ramparts that Minerva           Built and protects. A common enemy           Threatens you both, unite them to oppose           Aricia.            PHAEDRA           To your counsel I consent.           Yes, I will live, if life can be restored,           If my affection for a son has pow'r           To rouse my sinking heart at such a dangerous hour.     ACT II            SCENE I           ARICIA, ISMENE             ARICIA           Hippolytus request to see me here!           Hippolytus desire to bid farewell!           Is't true, Ismene? Are you not deceived?            ISMENE           This is the first result of Theseus' death.           Prepare yourself to see from every side.           Hearts turn towards you that were kept away           By Theseus. Mistress of her lot at last,           Aricia soon shall find all Greece fall low,           To do her homage.            ARICIA           'Tis not then, Ismene,           An idle tale? Am I no more a slave?           Have I no enemies?            ISMENE           The gods oppose           Your peace no longer, and the soul of Theseus           Is with your brothers.            ARICIA           Does the voice of fame           Tell how he died?            ISMENE           Rumours incredible           Are spread. Some say that, seizing a new bride,           The faithless husband by the waves was swallow'd.           Others affirm, and this report prevails,           That with Pirithous to the world below           He went, and saw the shores of dark Cocytus,           Showing himself alive to the pale ghosts;           But that he could not leave those gloomy realms,           Which whoso enters there abides for ever.            ARICIA           Shall I believe that ere his destined hour           A mortal may descend into the gulf           Of Hades? What attraction could o'ercome           Its terrors?            ISMENE           He is dead, and you alone           Doubt it. The men of Athens mourn his loss.           Troezen already hails Hippolytus           As King. And Phaedra, fearing for her son,           Asks counsel of the friends who share her trouble,           Here in this palace.            ARICIA           Will Hippolytus,           Think you, prove kinder than his sire, make light           My chains, and pity my misfortunes?            ISMENE           Yes,           I think so, Madam.            ARICIA           Ah, you know him not           Or you would never deem so hard a heart           Can pity feel, or me alone except           From the contempt in which he holds our sex.           Has he not long avoided every spot           Where we resort?            ISMENE           I know what tales are told           Of proud Hippolytus, but I have seen           Him near you, and have watch'd with curious eye           How one esteem'd so cold would bear himself.           Little did his behavior correspond           With what I look'd for; in his face confusion           Appear'd at your first glance, he could not turn           His languid eyes away, but gazed on you.           Love is a word that may offend his pride,           But what the tongue disowns, looks can betray.            ARICIA           How eagerly my heart hears what you say,           Tho' it may be delusion, dear Ismene!           Did it seem possible to you, who know me,           That I, sad sport of a relentless Fate,           Fed upon bitter tears by night and day,           Could ever taste the maddening draught of love?           The last frail offspring of a royal race,           Children of Earth, I only have survived           War's fury. Cut off in the flow'r of youth,           Mown by the sword, six brothers have I lost,           The hope of an illustrious house, whose blood           Earth drank with sorrow, near akin to his           Whom she herself produced. Since then, you know           How thro' all Greece no heart has been allow'd           To sigh for me, lest by a sister's flame           The brothers' ashes be perchance rekindled.           You know, besides, with what disdain I view'd           My conqueror's suspicions and precautions,           And how, oppos'd as I have ever been           To love, I often thank'd the King's injustice           Which happily confirm'd my inclination.           But then I never had beheld his son.           Not that, attracted merely by the eye, I           love him for his beauty and his grace,           Endowments which he owes to Nature's bounty,           Charms which he seems to know not or to scorn.           I love and prize in him riches more rare,           The virtues of his sire, without his faults.           I love, as I must own, that generous pride           Which ne'er has stoop'd beneath the amorous yoke.           Phaedra reaps little glory from a lover           So lavish of his sighs; I am too proud           To share devotion with a thousand others,           Or enter where the door is always open.           But to make one who ne'er has stoop'd before           Bend his proud neck, to pierce a heart of stone,           To bind a captive whom his chains astonish,           Who vainly 'gainst a pleasing yoke rebels,--           That piques my ardour, and I long for that.           'Twas easier to disarm the god of strength           Than this Hippolytus, for Hercules           Yielded so often to the eyes of beauty,           As to make triumph cheap. But, dear Ismene,           I take too little heed of opposition           Beyond my pow'r to quell, and you may hear me,           Humbled by sore defeat, upbraid the pride           I now admire. What! Can he love? and I           Have had the happiness to bend--            ISMENE           He comes           Yourself shall hear him.              SCENE II           HIPPOLYTUS, ARICIA, ISMENE             HIPPOLYTUS           Lady, ere I go           My duty bids me tell you of your change           Of fortune. My worst fears are realized;           My sire is dead. Yes, his protracted absence           Was caused as I foreboded.

The gods at last have doom'd           Alcides' friend, companion, and successor.           I think your hatred, tender to his virtues,           Can hear such terms of praise without resentment,           Knowing them due. One hope have I that soothes           My sorrow: I can free you from restraint.           Lo, I revoke the laws whose rigour moved           My pity; you are at your own disposal,           Both heart and hand; here, in my heritage,           In Troezen, where my grandsire Pittheus reign'd           Of yore and I am now acknowledged King,           I leave you free, free as myself,--and more.            ARICIA           Your kindness is too great, 'tis overwhelming.           Such generosity, that pays disgrace           With honour, lends more force than you can think           To those harsh laws from which you would release me.            HIPPOLYTUS           Athens, uncertain how to fill the throne           Of Theseus, speaks of you, anon of me,           And then of Phaedra's son.            ARICIA           Of me, my lord?            HIPPOLYTUS           I know myself excluded by strict law:           Greece turns to my reproach a foreign mother.           But if my brother were my only rival,           My rights prevail o'er his clearly enough           To make me careless of the law's caprice.           My forwardness is check'd by juster claims:           To you I yield my place, or, rather, own           That it is yours by right, and yours the sceptre,           As handed down from Earth's great son, Erechtheus.           Adoption placed it in the hands of Aegeus:           Athens, by him protected and increased,           Welcomed a king so generous as my sire,           And left your hapless brothers in oblivion.           Now she invites you back within her walls;           Protracted strife has cost her groans enough,           Her fields are glutted with your kinsmen's blood           Fatt'ning the furrows out of which it sprung           At first. I rule this Troezen; while the son           Of Phaedra has in Crete a rich domain.           Athens is yours. I will do all I can           To join for you the votes divided now           Between us.            ARICIA           Stunn'd at all I hear, my lord,           I fear, I almost fear a dream deceives me.           Am I indeed awake? Can I believe           Such generosity? What god has put it           Into your heart? Well is the fame deserved           That you enjoy! That fame falls short of truth!           Would you for me prove traitor to yourself?           Was it not boon enough never to hate me,           So long to have abstain'd from harbouring           The enmity--            HIPPOLYTUS           To hate you? I, to hate you?           However darkly my fierce pride was painted,           Do you suppose a monster gave me birth?           What savage temper, what envenom'd hatred           Would not be mollified at sight of you?           Could I resist the soul-bewitching charm--            ARICIA           Why, what is this, Sir?            HIPPOLYTUS           I have said too much           Not to say more. Prudence in vain resists           The violence of passion. I have broken           Silence at last, and I must tell you now           The secret that my heart can hold no longer.           You see before you an unhappy instance           Of hasty pride, a prince who claims compassion           I, who, so long the enemy of Love,           Mock'd at his fetters and despised his captives,           Who, pitying poor mortals that were shipwreck'd,           In seeming safety view'd the storms from land,           Now find myself to the same fate exposed,           Toss'd to and fro upon a sea of troubles!           My boldness has been vanquish'd in a moment,           And humbled is the pride wherein I boasted.           For nearly six months past, ashamed, despairing,           Bearing where'er I go the shaft that rends           My heart, I struggle vainly to be free           From you and from myself; I shun you, present;           Absent, I find you near; I see your form           In the dark forest depths; the shades of night,           Nor less broad daylight, bring back to my view           The charms that I avoid; all things conspire           To make Hippolytus your slave. For fruit           Of all my bootless sighs, I fail to find           My former self. My bow and javelins           Please me no more, my chariot is forgotten,           With all the Sea God's lessons; and the woods           Echo my groans instead of joyous shouts           Urging my fiery steeds.            Hearing this tale           Of passion so uncouth, you blush perchance           At your own handiwork. With what wild words           I offer you my heart, strange captive held           By silken jess! But dearer in your eyes           Should be the offering, that this language comes           Strange to my lips; reject not vows express'd           So ill, which but for you had ne'er been form'd.              SCENE III           HIPPOLYTUS, ARICIA, THERAMENES, ISMENE             THERAMENES           Prince, the Queen comes. I herald her approach.           'Tis you she seeks.            HIPPOLYTUS           Me?            THERAMENES           What her thought may be           I know not. But I speak on her behalf.           She would converse with you ere you go hence.            HIPPOLYTUS           What shall I say to her? Can she expect--            ARICIA           You cannot, noble Prince, refuse to hear her,           Howe'er convinced she is your enemy,           Some shade of pity to her tears is due.            HIPPOLYTUS           Shall we part thus? and will you let me go,           Not knowing if my boldness has offended           The goddess I adore? Whether this heart,           Left in your hands--            ARICIA           Go, Prince, pursue the schemes           Your generous soul dictates, make Athens own           My sceptre. All the gifts you offer me           Will I accept, but this high throne of empire           Is not the one most precious in my sight.              SCENE IV           HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES             HIPPOLYTUS           Friend, is all ready?           But the Queen approaches.           Go, see the vessel in fit trim to sail.           Haste, bid the crew aboard, and hoist the signal:           Then soon return, and so deliver me           From interview most irksome.              SCENE V           PHAEDRA, HIPPOLYTUS, OENONE             PHAEDRA (to OENONE)           There I see him!           My blood forgets to flow, my tongue to speak           What I am come to say.            OENONE           Think of your son,           How all his hopes depend on you.            PHAEDRA           I hear           You leave us, and in haste. I come to add           My tears to your distress, and for a son           Plead my alarm. No more has he a father,           And at no distant day my son must witness           My death. Already do a thousand foes           Threaten his youth. You only can defend him           But in my secret heart remorse awakes,           And fear lest I have shut your ears against           His cries. I tremble lest your righteous anger           Visit on him ere long the hatred earn'd           By me, his mother.            HIPPOLYTUS           No such base resentment,           Madam, is mine.            PHAEDRA           I could not blame you, Prince,           If you should hate me. I have injured you:           So much you know, but could not read my heart.           T' incur your enmity has been mine aim.           The self-same borders could not hold us both;           In public and in private I declared           Myself your foe, and found no peace till seas           Parted us from each other. I forbade           Your very name to be pronounced before me.           And yet if punishment should be proportion'd           To the offence, if only hatred draws           Your hatred, never woman merited           More pity, less deserved your enmity.            HIPPOLYTUS           A mother jealous of her children's rights           Seldom forgives the offspring of a wife           Who reign'd before her. Harassing suspicions           Are common sequels of a second marriage.           Of me would any other have been jealous           No less than you, perhaps more violent.            PHAEDRA           Ah, Prince, how Heav'n has from the general law           Made me exempt, be that same Heav'n my witness!           Far different is the trouble that devours me!            HIPPOLYTUS           This is no time for self-reproaches, Madam.           It may be that your husband still beholds           The light, and Heav'n may grant him safe return,           In answer to our prayers.
