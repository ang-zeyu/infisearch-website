The fiddler waved his bow at Uncle Jake, and the boys and girls cried \"Howdy,\" as the visitor stood beaming and smiling in the doorway. To these demonstrations Uncle Jake, \"a chunk of a white man with a whole heart,\" as he described himself, made cordial response, and passed on into the kitchen. The good-humour of Mr. Norris was as prominent as his rotundity. When he was not laughing, he was ready to laugh. He seated himself, looked around at the company, and smiled.  \"It's a long pull betwixt this an' Atlanty,\" he said after a while; \"it is that, certain an' shore, an' I hain't smelt of the jug sence I lef ther'. Pull 'er out, Teague, pull 'er out.\"  The jug was forthcoming.  \"Now, then,\" continued Uncle Jake, removing the corn-cob stopper, \"this looks like home, sweet home, ez I may say. It does, certain an' shore. None to jine me? Well, well! Times change an' change, but the jug is company for one. So be it. Ez St. Paul says, cleave nigh unto that which is good. I'm foreswore not to feel lonesome tell I go to the gallows. Friends! you uv got my good wishes, one an' all!\"  \"What's a-gwine on?\" asked Poteet.  \"The same,\" responded Uncle Jake, after swallowing his dram. \"Allers the same. Wickedness pervails wellnigh unto hit's own jestiflcation. I uv seed sights! You all know the divers besettings wher'by Jackson Ricks wuz took off this season gone--murdered I may say, in the teeth of the law an' good govunment. Sirs! I sot by an' seed his besetters go scotch-free.\"  \"Ah!\"  The exclamation came from Teague Poteet.  \"Yes, sirs! yes, friends!\" continued Uncle Jake, closing his eyes and tilting his chair back. \"Even so. Nuther does I boast ez becometh the fibble-minded. They hurried an' skurried me forth an' hence, to mount upon the witness stan' an' relate the deed. No deniance did I make. Ez St. Paul says, sin, takin' occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of conspicuessence. I told 'em what these here eyes had seed.  \"They errayed me before jedge an' jury,\" Uncle Jake went on, patting the jug affectionately, \"an' I bowed my howdies. 'Gen-termun friends,' s' I, 'foller me close't, bekaze I'm a-givin' you but the truth, stupendous though it be. Ef you thes but name the word,' s' I, 'I'll take an' lay my han' upon the men that done this unrighteousness, for they stan' no furder than yon piller,' s' I. 'Them men,' s' I, 'surroundered the house of Jackson Ricks, gentermun friends, he bein' a member of Friendship Church, an' called 'im forth wi' the ashoreance of Satan an' the intents of evil,' s' I; 'an' ole en decrippled ez he wuz, they shot 'im down--them men at yon piller,' s' I, 'ere he could but raise his trimblin' han' in supplication; an' the boldest of 'em dast not to face me here an' say nay,' s' I.\"  \"An' they uv cler'd the men what kilt pore Jackson Ricks!\" said Teague, rubbing his grizzled chin.  \"Ez clean an' ez cle'r ez the pa'm er my han',\" replied Uncle Jake, with emphasis.  The fiddle in the next room screamed forth a jig, and the tireless feet of the dancers kept time, but there was profound silence among those in the kitchen. Uncle Jake took advantage of this pause to renew his acquaintance with the jug.  Deputy-Marshal Woodward knew of the killing of Jackson Ricks; that is to say, he was familiar with the version of the affair which had been depended upon to relieve the revenue officers of the responsibility of downright murder; but he was convinced that the story told by Uncle Jake Norris was nearer the truth.  As the young man rode down the mountain, leaving the fiddle and the dancers to carry the frolic into the grey dawn, he pictured to himself the results of the raid that he would be expected to lead against Hog Mountain--the rush upon Poteet's, the shooting of the old Moonshiner, and the spectacle of the daughter wringing her hands and weeping wildly. He rode down the mountain, and, before the sun rose, he had written and mailed his resignation. In a private note to the marshal, enclosed with this document, he briefly but clearly set forth the fact that, while illicit distilling was as unlawful as ever, the man who loved a Moonshiner's daughter was not a proper instrument to aid in its suppression.  But his letter failed to have the effect he desired, and in a few weeks he received a communication from Atlanta setting forth the fact that a raid had been determined upon.  Meantime, while events were developing, some of the old women of the Hog Mountain Range had begun to manifest a sort of motherly interest in the affairs of Woodward and Sis Poteet. These women, living miles apart on the mountain and its spurs, had a habit of \"picking up their work\" and spending the day with each other. Upon one occasion it chanced that Mrs. Sue Parmalee and Mrs. Puritha Hightower rode ten miles to visit Mrs. Puss Poteet.  \"Don't lay the blame of it onter me, Puss,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower,--her shrill, thin voice in queer contrast with her fat and jovial appearance; \"don't you lay the blame onter me. Dave, he's been a-complainin' bekaze they wa'n't no salsody in the house, an' I rid over to Sue's to borry some. Airter I got ther', Sue sez, se' she; 'Yess us pick up an' go an' light in on Puss,' se' she, 'an' fine out sump'n' nuther that's a-gwine on 'mongst folks,' se' she.\"  \"Yes, lay it all onter me,\" said Mrs. Parmalee, looking over her spectacles at Mrs. Poteet; \"I sez to Purithy, s' I, 'Purithy, yess go down an' see Puss,' s' I; 'maybe we'll git a glimpse er that air new chap with the slick ha'r. Sid'll be a-peggin' out airter a while,' s' I, 'an' ef the new chap's ez purty ez I hear tell, maybe I'll set my cap fer 'im,' s' I.\"  At this fat Mrs. Puritha Hightower was compelled to lean on frail Mrs. Puss Poteet, so heartily did she laugh.  \"I declar',\" she exclaimed, \"ef Sue hain't a sight! I'm mighty nigh outdone. She's thes bin a-gwine on that a-way all the time, an' I bin that tickled tell a little more an' I'd a drapped on the groun'. How's all?\"  \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Poteet, \"I hope you all know _me_ too well to be a-stan'in' out there makin' excuse. Come right along in, an' take off your things, an' ketch your win'. Sis is home to-day.\"  \"Well, I'm monstus glad,\" said Mrs. Hightower. \"Sis use to think the world an' all er me when she was a slip of a gal, but I reckon she's took on town ways, hain't she? Hit ain't nothin' but natchul.\"  \"Sis is proud enough for to hoi' 'er head high,\" Mrs. Parmalee explained, \"but she hain't a bit stuck up.\"  \"Well, I let you know,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower, untying her bonnet and taking off her shawl, \"I let you know, here's what wouldn't be sot back by nothin' ef she had Sis's chances. In about the las' word pore maw spoke on 'er dying bed, she call me to 'er an' sez, se' she, 'Purithy Emma,' se' she, 'you hol' your head high; don't you bat your eyes for to please none of 'em,' se' she.\"  \"I reckon in reason I oughter be thankful that Sis ain't no wuss,\" said Mrs. Poteet, walking around with aimless hospitality; \"yit that chile's temper is powerful tryin', an' Teague ackshully an' candidly b'leeves she's made out'n pyo'gol'. [Footnote: Pure gold] I wish I may die ef he don't.\"  After a while Sis made her appearance, buoyant and blooming. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks glowed, and her smiles showed beautiful teeth--a most uncommon sight in the mountains, where the girls were in the habit of rubbing snuff or smoking. The visitors greeted her with the effusive constraint and awkwardness that made so large a part of their lives, but after a while Mrs. Hightower laid her fat motherly hand on the girl's shoulder, and looked kindly but keenly into her eyes.  \"Ah, honey!\" she said, \"you hain't sp'ilt yit, but you wa'n't made to fit thish here hill--_that_ you wa'n't, _that_ you wa'n't!\"  Women are not hypocrites. Their little thrills arid nerve-convulsions are genuine while they last. Fortunately for the women themselves, they do not last, but are succeeded by others of various moods, tenses, and genders. These nerve-convulsions are so genuine and so apt that they are known as intuitions, and under this name they have achieved importance. Mrs. Hightower, with all her lack of experience, was capable of feeling that Sis Poteet needed the by no means unsubstantial encouragement that lies in one little note of sympathy, and she was not at all astonished when Sis responded to her intention by giving her a smart little hug.  Presently Mrs. Parmalee, who had stationed herself near the door, lifted her thin right arm and let it fall upon her lap.  \"Well, sir!\" she exclaimed, \"ef yander ain't Sis's bo!\"  Sis ran to the door, saw Woodward coming up the road, and blushed furiously--a feat which Mrs. Hightower and Mrs. Parmalee, with all their experience, had rarely seen performed in that region.  Woodward greeted Mrs. Poteet's visitors with a gentle deference and an easy courtesy that attracted their favour in spite of themselves. Classing him with the \"Restercrats,\" these women took keen and suspicious note of every word he uttered, and every movement he made, holding themselves in readiness to become mortally offended at a curl of the lip or the lifting of an eyebrow; but he was equal to the occasion. He humoured their whims and eccentricities to the utmost, and he was so thoroughly sympathetic, so genial, so sunny, and so handsome withal, that he stirred most powerfully the maternal instincts of those weather-beaten bosoms, and made them his friends and defenders. He told them wonderful stories of life in the great world that lay far beyond Hog Mountain, its spurs and its foot-hills. He lighted their pipes, and even filled them out of his own tobacco-pouch, a proceeding which caused Mrs. Parmalee to remark that she \"would like mannyfac' [Footnote: \"Manufactured\" tobacco, in contradistinction to the natural leaf.] mighty well ef 'twer'n't so powerful weak.\"  Mrs. Hightower found early opportunity to deliver her verdict in Sis's ear, whereupon the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19648"],["title","Mingo, and Other Sketches in Black and White (#8)"],["body","gave her a little hug, and whispered: \"Oh, I just think he's adorable!\" It was very queer, however, that as soon as Sis was left to entertain Mr. Woodward (the women making an excuse of helping Puss about dinner), she lost her blushing enthusiasm, and became quite cold and reserved. The truth is, Sis had convinced herself some days before that she had the right to be very angry with this young man, and she began her quarrel, as lovely woman generally does, by assuming an air of tremendous unconcern. Her disinterestedness was really provoking.  \"How did you like Sue Fraley's new bonnet last Sunday?\" she asked, with an innocent smile.  \"Sue Fraley's new bonnet!\" exclaimed Woodward, surprised in the midst of some serious reflections; \"why, I didn't know she had a new bonnet.\"  \"Oh! you _didn't_? You were right _opposite_. I should think _anybody_ could see she had a new bonnet by the way she tossed her head.\"  \"Well, I didn't notice it, for one. Was it one of these sky-scrapers? I was looking at something else.\"  \"_Oh!_\"  Woodward had intended to convey a very delicately veiled compliment, but this young woman's tone rather embarrassed him. He saw in a moment that she was beyond the reach of the playful and ingenious banter which he had contrived to make the basis of their relations.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I was looking at something else. I had other things to think about.\"  \"Well, she _did_ have a new bonnet, with yellow ribbons. She looked handsome. I hear she's going to get married soon.\"  \"I'm glad to hear it. She's none too young,\" said Woodward.  At another time Sis would have laughed at the suggestion implied in this remark, but now she only tapped the floor gently with her foot, and looked serious.  \"I hope you answered her note,\" she said presently.  \"What note?\" he asked, with some astonishment,  Sis was the picture of innocence.  \"Oh, I didn't think!\" she exclaimed. \"I reckon it's a great _secret_. I mean the note she handed you when she came out of church. It's none of _my_ business.\"  \"Nor of mine either,\" said Woodward, with a relieved air. \"The note was for Tip Watson.\"  This statement, which was not only plausible but true, gave a new direction to Sis's anger.  \"Well, I don't see how anybody that thinks anything of himself could be a mail-carrier for _Sue Fraley!_\" she exclaimed scornfully; whereupon she flounced out, leaving Woodward in a state of bewilderment.  He had not made love to the girl, principally because her moods were elusive and her methods unique. She was dangerously like other women of his acquaintance, and dangerously unlike them. The principal of the academy in Gullettsville--a scholarly old gentleman from Middle Georgia, who had been driven to teaching by dire necessity--had once loftily informed Woodward that Miss Poteet was superior to her books, and the young man had verified the statement to his own discomfiture. She possessed that feminine gift which is of more importance to a woman in this world than scholarly acquirements--aptitude. Even her frankness--perfectly discreet--charmed and puzzled Woodward; but the most attractive of her traits were such as mark the difference between the bird that sings in the tree and the bird that sings in the cage--delightful, but indescribable.  When Sis Poteet began to question him about Sue Fraley, the thought that she was moved by jealousy gave him a thrill that was new to his experience; but when she flounced angrily out of the room because he had confessed to carrying a note from Miss Fraley to Tip Watson, it occurred to him that he might be mistaken. Indeed, so cunning does masculine stupidity become when it is played upon by a woman, that he frightened himself with the suggestion that perhaps, after all, this perfectly original young lady was in love with Tip Watson.  During the rest of the day Woodward had ample time to nurse and develop his new theory, and the more he thought it over the more plausible it seemed to be. It was a great blow to his vanity; but the more uncomfortable it made him the more earnestly he clung to it.  Without appearing to avoid him, Sis managed to make the presence of Mrs. Parmalee and Mrs. Hightower an excuse for neglecting him. She entertained these worthy ladies with such eager hospitality that when they aroused themselves to the necessity of going home, they found to their dismay that it would be impossible, in the language of Mrs. Poteet, to \"git half way acrost Pullium's Summit 'fore night 'ud ketch 'em.\" Sis was so delighted, apparently, that she became almost hilarious; and her gaiety affected all around her except Woodward, who barely managed to conceal his disgust.  After supper, however, Mrs. Poteet and her two guests betook themselves to the kitchen, where they rubbed snuff and smoked their pipes, and gossiped, and related reminiscences of that good time which, with old people, is always in the past. Thus Woodward had ample opportunity to talk with Sis. He endeavoured, by the exercise of every art of manner and conversation of which he was master, to place their relations upon the old familiar footing, but he failed most signally. He found it impossible to fathom the gentle dignity with which he was constantly repulsed. In the midst of his perplexity, which would have been either pathetic or ridiculous if it had not been so artfully concealed, he managed for the first time to measure the depth of his love for this exasperating but charming creature whom he had been patronising. She was no longer amusing; and Woodward, with the savage inconsistency of a man moved by a genuine passion, felt a tragic desire to humble himself before her.  \"I'm going home to-morrow, Miss Sis,\" he said finally, in sheer desperation.  \"Well, you've had a heap of fun--I mean,\" she added, \"that you have had a nice time.\"  \"I have been a fool!\" he exclaimed bitterly. Seeing that she made no response, he continued: \"I've been a terrible fool all through. I came here to hunt up blockade whisky----\"  \"_What!_\"  Sis's voice was sharp and eager, full of doubt, surprise, and consternation.  \"I came to Gullettsville,\" he went on, \"to hunt up blockade whisky, and failed, and three weeks ago I sent in my resignation. I thought I might find a gold mine on my land-lot, but I have failed, and now I am going to sell it. I have failed in everything.\"  Gloating over his alleged misfortunes, Woodward, without looking at Sis Poteet, drew from his pocket a formidable-looking envelope, unfolded its contents leisurely, and continued--  \"Even my resignation was a failure. Hog Mountain will be raided to-morrow or next day.\"  Sis rose from her chair, pale and furious, and advanced toward him as if to annihilate him with her blazing eyes. Such rage, such contempt, he had never before beheld in a woman's face. He sat transfixed. With a gesture almost tragic in its vehemence, the girl struck the papers from his hands.  \"O you mean, sneaking wretch! You----\"  And then, as if realising the weakness of mere words, she turned and passed swiftly from the room. Woodward was thoroughly aroused. He was not used to the spectacle of a woman controlled by violent emotions, and he recognised, with a mixture of surprise and alarm, the great gulf that lay between the rage of Sis Poteet and the little platitudes and pretences of anger which he had seen the other women of his acquaintance manage with such pretty daintiness.  As the girl passed through the kitchen, she seized a horn that hung upon the wall, and went out into the darkness. The old women continued their smoking, their snuff-rubbing, and their gossiping. Mrs. High-tower was giving the details of a local legend showing how and why Edny Favers had \"conjured\" Tabithy Cozby, when suddenly Mrs. Poteet raised her hands--  \"_Sh-h-h!_\"  The notes of a horn--short, sharp, and strenuous--broke in upon the stillness of the night. Once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! It was an alarm that did not need to be interpreted to the sensitive ear of Hog Mountain. The faces of the old women became curiously impassive. The firelight carried their shadows from the floor to the rafters, where they seemed to engage in a wild dance,--whirling, bowing, jumping, quivering; but the women themselves sat as still as statues. They were evidently waiting for something. They did not wait long. In a little while the sharp notes of the horn made themselves heard again--once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice!  Then the old women arose from their low chairs, shook out their frocks, and filed into the room where Mr. Philip Woodward, late of the revenue service, was sitting. There would have been a good deal of constraint on both sides, but before there could be any manifestation of this sort, Sis came in. She seemed to be crushed and helpless, nay, even humiliated.  \"Why, my goodness, Sis!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower, \"you look natchully fagged out. A body 'ud think you'd bin an' taken a run up the mountain. We all 'lowed you wuz in here lookin' airter your comp'ny. Wher'd you git the news?\"  \"From this gentleman here,\" Sis replied, indicating Woodward without looking at him. She was pale as death, and her voice was low and gentle.  Woodward would have explained, but the apparent unconcern of the women gave him no opportunity.  \"I declare, Sis,\" exclaimed her mother, with a fond, apologetic little laugh; \"ef you hain't a plum sight, I hain't never seed none.\"  \"She's thes es much like her Gran'pap Poteet,\" said Mrs. Hightower, \"ez ef he'd 'a' spit'er right out'n his mouth--that she is.\"  This led to a series of reminiscences more or less entertaining, until after a while, Sis, who had been growing more and more restless, rose and said--  \"Good night, folks; I'm tired and sleepy. The clock has struck eleven.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Poteet, \"an' the clock's too fast, bekaze it hain't skacely bin more'u a minnit sence the chickens crowed for ten.\"  This remark contained the essence of"]]]
