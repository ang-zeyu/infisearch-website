Name it and I'll do my best.\"  Doc had a vague idea of village politics, but he had more important things to think of. Most of his foul mood had disappeared with the clue he'd stumbled on, and his chief worry now was to clinch the facts.  Feldman considered the problem. \"I want a report on every case of jumping headache in every village--who had it, when, and how old they were. This place first, but every village you can reach. And I'll want someone to take a letter to Chris Ryan.\"  Jake frowned at that, but went out to issue instructions. Doc sat down at a battered old typewriter. Writing Chris might do no good, but some warning had to be gotten through to Earth, where the vast resources of Medical Lobby could be thrown into the task of finding the cause and cure of the disease. The connection with Selznik's migraine had to be reported. If something could blast the Lobby into action, it wouldn't matter quite so much what they did to him. He wasn't foolish enough to expect gratitude from them, but he was getting used to the idea that his days were numbered. The plague was more important than what happened to him.  The letter had been dispatched by the time Jake returned. \"Here's the dope for this village. Everybody accounted for except you.\"  \"Never had it, Jake.\" Feldman went down the list. \"Most of it fourteen years ago. That fits. About the only exceptions are the kids who seem to get it between the ages of two and three. Eighty-seven out of ninety-one!\"  He stared at the figures sickly. Most of the village not only had the plague but must be near the end of the incubation period. It looked as if most of the village would be dead before another year passed.  \"Bad?\" Jake asked.  \"The first symptom of Martian fever.\"  The old man whistled, the lines around his eyes tightening. \"Must be me,\" he decided. \"I'm the guy who must have brought it here, then. I used to spend a lot of time with Durwood at his diggings!\"  There was a constant commotion all that day and the next as runners went out to the villages and came back with reports. The variation from village to village was only slight. Most of Mars seemed to have advanced cases of Martian fever.  Without animals for investigation and study, real research was difficult. Doc also needed an electron microscope. He was reasonably sure that the disease must travel through the nerves, but he had found no proof beyond the hard lump at the base of the neck. There it was a fair-sized organism. Elsewhere he could find nothing, until the black specks developed.  His eyes ached from trying to see more than was visible in the microscope. The tantalizing suggestions of filaments around the nuclei might be the form of plague that was contagious. They might even be the true form of the bug, with the bigger cell only a transition stage. There were a number of diseases that involved complicated changes in the organisms that caused them. But he couldn't be sure.  He finally buried his head in his hands, trying to do by pure thought what he couldn't do in any other way. And even there, he lacked training. He was a doctor, not a xenobiologist. Research training had been taboo in school, except for a favored few.  The reports continued to come in, confirming the danger. They seemed to have the worst plague on their hands in all human history; and nobody who could do anything about it even knew of it.  \"Molly reports that your letter got some results,\" Jake reported. \"Chris Ryan brought home one of the electron microscopes and a bunch of equipment from the hospital pathology room. Think she'll get anywhere?\"  Doc doubted it. Damn it, he hadn't meant for her to try it, though she might have authority for routine experiments. But it was like her to refuse to pass on the word without trying to prove her own suspicion of him first.  He tried to comfort himself with the fact that some men were immune, or seemed so; about three out of a hundred showed no signs. If that immunity was hereditary, it might save the race. If not....  Jake came in at twilight with a grim face. \"More news from Molly. The Lobby is starting out to comb every village with a fault-finder, starting here. And this hole will show up like a sore thumb. Better start packing. We gotta be out of here in less than an hour!\"     VIII  Fool   Three days later, Doc saw his first runner.  The tractor was churning through the sand just before sundown, heading toward another one-night stand at a new village. Lou was driving, while Doc and Jake brooded silently in the back, paying no attention to the colors that were blazoned over the dunes. The cat-and-mouse game was getting to Doc. There was no real assurance that the village they were approaching might not be the target the Lobby had chosen for the next investigation.  Lou braked the tractor to a sudden halt, and pointed.  A figure was running frantically over one of the low dunes with the little red sun behind him. He seemed headed toward them, but as he drew nearer they could see that he had no definite direction. He simply ran, pumping his legs frantically as if all the devils of hell were after him. His body swayed from side to side in exhaustion, but his arms and legs pumped on.  \"Stop him!\" Jake ordered, and Lou swung the tractor. It halted squarely in the runner's path, and the figure struck against it and toppled.  The legs went on pumping, digging into the dirt and gravel, but the man was too far gone to rise. Jake and Lou shoved him through the doors into the tractor and Doc yanked off his aspirator.  The man was giving vent to a kind of ululating cry, weakened now almost to a whine that rose and fell with the motion of his legs. Sweat had once streaked his haggard face, but it was dry and blanched to a pasty gray.  Doc injected enough narcotic to quiet a maddened bull. It had no effect, except to upset the rhythm of the arms and legs. It took five more minutes for the man to die.  The specks were larger this time--the size of periods in twelve-point type. The lump at the base of the skull was as big as a small hen's egg.  \"From Edison, like the others so far. Jack Kooley,\" Jake answered Doc's question. \"Durwood spent a lot of time here on his first expedition, so it's getting the worst of it.\"  Doc pulled the aspirator mask back over the man's face and they carried him out and laid him on a low dune. They couldn't risk returning the corpse to its people.  This was only the primary circle of infection, direct from Durwood. The second circle could be ten times as large, as the infection spread from one to a few to many. So far it was localized. But it wouldn't stay that way.  Doc climbed slowly out of the tractor, lugging his small supplies of equipment, while Jake made arrangements for them to spend the night in a deserted house. But the figure of the runner and his own failures to find more about the disease kept haunting Doc. He began setting up his equipment grimly.  \"Better get some sleep,\" Jake suggested. \"You're a mite more tired than you think. Anyhow, I thought you told me you couldn't do any more with what you've got.\"  Feldman looked at the supplies he had spread out, and shook his head wearily. He'd been over every chemical and combination a dozen times, without results that showed in the limited magnification of the optical mike.  He snapped the case shut and hit the rude table with the heel of his hand. \"There are other supplies. Jake, do you have any signal to get in touch with Molly at the Ryan house?\"  \"Three raps on the rear left window. I'll get Lou.\"  \"No!\" Doc came to his feet, reaching for his jacket. \"They're looking for three men now. It's safer if I go alone--and I'm the only one who knows what supplies are needed. With luck, I may even get the electron mike. Got a gun I can borrow?\"  Jake found one somewhere, an old revolver with a few loads. He began protesting, but Doc overruled him sharply. Three men could no more fight off the police than one, if they were spotted. He swung toward the tractor.  \"You'd better start spreading the word on everything we know. If people realize they're already safe or doomed it'll be better than having them going crazy to avoid contagion.\"  \"Most of the villages know already,\" Jake told him. \"And damn it, get back here, Doc. If you can't make it, turn tail quick, and we'll think of something else.\"  Southport seemed normal enough as Doc drove through its streets. The stereo house was open, and the little shops were brightly lighted. He stopped once to pull a copy of Southport's little newspaper from a dispenser. All was quiet on its front page, too.  As usual, though, the facts were buried inside. The editorial was pouring too much oil on the waters in its lauding of the role of Medical Lobby on Mars for no apparent reason. The death notices no longer listed the cause of death. Medical knew something was up, at least, and was worried.  He parked the tractor behind Chris' house and slipped to the proper window. Everything was seemingly quiet there. At his knock, the shade was drawn back, and he caught a brief glimpse of Molly looking out. A moment later she opened the rear lock to let him into the kitchen.  \"Shh. She's still up, I think. What can I do, Doc?\"  He tried to smile at her. \"Hide me until it's safe to get into her laboratory. I've got to--\"  The inner kitchen was kicked open and Chris stood beyond it, holding a cocked gun in her hand.  \"It took longer than I expected, Dan,\" she said quietly. \"But after your letter, I knew you'd swallow the bait. You bloody fool! Did you really believe I'd start doing research here just because of your imaginings?\"  He slumped slowly back against the sink. \"So this is a fool's errand, then? There never was any equipment here?\"  \"The equipment's here--in my office. I guessed your spies would report it, so it had to be here. But it won't help you now, pariah Feldman!\"  He came from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19473"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"I'm big enough to protect my Mother, and I'll do it.\"  _p. 42._]     NOW OR NEVER  OR  THE ADVENTURES OF BOBBY BRIGHT   _A STORY FOR YOUNG FOLKS_   OLIVER OPTIC   _NEW EDITION_   NEW YORK THE MERSHON COMPANY PUBLISHERS     Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1856, by  WILLIAM T. ADAMS,  in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.   Copyright, 1884, By WILLIAM T. ADAMS.     NOW OR NEVER.     To my Nephew  CHARLES HENRY POPE  THIS BOOK  IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED     PREFACE   The story contained in this volume is a record of youthful struggles, not only in the world without, but in the world within; and the success of the little hero is not merely a gathering up of wealth and honors, but a triumph over the temptations that beset the pilgrim on the plain of life. The attainment of worldly prosperity is not the truest victory; and the author has endeavored to make the interest of his story depend more on the hero's devotion to principles than on his success in business.  Bobby Bright is a smart boy; perhaps the reader will think he is altogether too smart for one of his years. This is a progressive age, and anything which young America may do need not surprise any person. That little gentleman is older than his father, knows more than his mother, can talk politics, smoke cigars, and drive a 2:40 horse. He orders \"one stew\" with as much ease as a man of forty, and can even pronounce correctly the villanous names of sundry French and German wines and liqueurs. One would suppose, to hear him talk, that he had been intimate with Socrates and Solon, with Napoleon and Noah Webster; in short, that whatever he did not know was not worth knowing.  In the face of these manifestations of exuberant genius, it would be absurd to accuse the author of making his hero do too much. All he has done is to give this genius a right direction; and for politics, cigars, 2:40 horses, and \"one stew,\" he has substituted the duties of a rational and accountable being, regarding them as better fitted to develop the young gentleman's mind, heart, and soul.  Bobby Bright is something more than a smart boy. He is a good boy, and makes a true man. His daily life is the moral of the story, and the author hopes that his devotion to principle will make a stronger impression upon the mind of the young reader, than even the most exciting incidents of his eventful career.

I've got a bite!\" exclaimed Tom Spicer, a rough, hard-looking boy, who sat on a rock by the river's side, anxiously watching the cork float on his line.  \"Catch him, then,\" quietly responded Bobby Bright, who occupied another rock near the first speaker, as he pulled up a large pout, and, without any appearance of exultation, proceeded to unhook and place him in his basket.  \"You are a lucky dog, Bob,\" added Tom, as he glanced into the basket of his companion, which now contained six good-sized fishes. \"I haven't caught one yet.\"  \"You don't fish deep enough.\"  \"I fish on the bottom.\"  \"That is too deep.\"  \"It don't make any difference how I fish; it is all luck.\"  \"Not all luck, Tom; there is something in doing it right.\"  \"I shall not catch a fish,\" continued Tom, in despair.  \"You'll catch something else, though, when you go home.\"  \"Will I?\"  \"I'm afraid you will.\"  \"Who says I will?\"  \"Didn't you tell me you were 'hooking jack'?\"  \"Who is going to know anything about it?\"  \"The master will know you are absent.\"  \"I shall tell him my mother sent me over to the village on an errand.\"  \"I never knew a fellow to 'hook jack,' yet, without getting found out.\"  \"I shall not get found out unless you blow on me; and you wouldn't be mean enough to do that;\" and Tom glanced uneasily at his companion.  \"Suppose your mother should ask me if I had seen you.\"  \"You would tell her you have not, of course.\"  \"Of course?\"  \"Why, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you do as much as that for a fellow?\"  \"It would be a lie.\"  \"A lie! Humph!\"  \"I wouldn't lie for any fellow,\" replied Bobby, stoutly, as he pulled in his seventh fish, and placed him in the basket.  \"Wouldn't you?\"  \"No, I wouldn't.\"  \"Then let me tell you this; if you peach on me, I'll smash your head.\"  Tom Spicer removed one hand from the fish pole and, doubling his fist, shook it with energy at his companion.  \"Smash away,\" replied Bobby, coolly. \"I shall not go out of my way to tell tales; but if your mother or the master asks me the question, I shall not lie.\"  \"Won't you?\"  \"No, I won't.\"  \"I'll bet you will;\" and Tom dropped his fish pole, and was on the point of jumping over to the rock occupied by Bobby, when the float of the former disappeared beneath the surface of the water.  \"You've got a bite,\" coolly interposed Bobby, pointing to the line.  Tom snatched the pole, and with a violent twitch, pulled up a big pout; but his violence jerked the hook out of the fish's mouth, and he disappeared beneath the surface of the river.  \"Just my luck!\" muttered Tom.  \"Keep cool, then.\"  \"I will fix you yet.\"  \"All right; but you had better not let go your pole again, or you will lose another fish.\"  \"I'm bound to smash your head, though.\"  \"No, you won't.\"  \"Won't I?\"  \"Two can play at that game.\"  \"Do you stump me?\"  \"No; I don't want to fight; I won't fight if I can help it.\"  \"I'll bet you won't!\" sneered Tom.  \"But I will defend myself.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"I am not a liar, and the fear of a flogging shall not make me tell a lie.\"  \"Go to Sunday school--don't you?\"  \"I do; and besides that, my mother always taught me never to tell a lie.\"  \"Come! you needn't preach to me. By and by, you will call me a liar.\"  \"No, I won't; but just now you told me you meant to lie to your mother, and to the master.\"  \"What if I did? That is none of your business.\"  \"It _is_ my business when you want me to lie for you, though; and I shall not do it.\"  \"Blow on me, and see what you will get.\"  \"I don't mean to blow on you.\"  \"Yes, you do.\"  \"I will not lie about it; that's all.\"  \"By jolly! see that horse!\" exclaimed Tom, suddenly, as he pointed to the road leading to Riverdale Centre.  \"By gracious!\" added Bobby, dropping his fish pole, as he saw the horse running at a furious rate up the road from the village.  The mad animal was attached to a chaise, in which was seated a lady, whose frantic shrieks pierced the soul of our youthful hero.  The course of the road was by the river's side for nearly half a mile, and crossed the stream at a wooden bridge but a few rods from the place where the boys were fishing.  Bobby Bright's impulses were noble and generous; and without stopping to consider the peril to which the attempt would expose him, he boldly resolved to stop that horse, or let the animal dash him to pieces on the bridge.  \"Now or never!\" shouted he, as he leaped from the rock, and ran with all his might to the bridge.  The shrieks of the lady rang in his ears, and seemed to command him, with an authority which he could not resist, to stop the horse. There was no time for deliberation; and, indeed, Bobby did not want any deliberation. The lady was in danger; if the horse's flight was not checked, she would be dashed in pieces; and what then could excuse him for neglecting his duty? Not the fear of broken limbs, of mangled flesh, or even of a sudden and violent death.  It is true Bobby did not think of any of these things;"]]]
