In that forest to and fro     I can wander, I can go;     See the spider and the fly,     And the ants go marching by     Carrying parcels with their feet     Down the green and grassy street.     I can in the sorrel sit     Where the ladybird alit.     I can climb the jointed grass;         And on high     See the greater swallows pass         In the sky,     And the round sun rolling by     Heeding no such things as I.      Through that forest I can pass     Till, as in a looking-glass,     Humming fly and daisy tree     And my tiny self I see,     Painted very clear and neat     On the rain-pool at my feet.      Should a leaflet come to land     Drifting near to where I stand,     Straight I'll board that tiny boat     Round the rain-pool sea to float.      Little thoughtful creatures sit     On the grassy coasts of it;     Little things with lovely eyes     See me sailing with surprise.     Some are clad in armour green--     (These have sure to battle been!)--     Some are pied with ev'ry hue,     Black and crimson, gold and blue;     Some have wings and swift are gone;     But they all look kindly on.      When my eyes I once again     Open, and see all things plain;     High bare walls, great bare floor;     Great big knobs on drawer and door;     Great big people perched on chairs,     Stitching tucks and mending tears,     Each a hill that I could climb,     And talking nonsense all the time--        O dear me,        That I could be     A sailor on the rain-pool sea,     A climber in, the clover tree,     And just come back, a sleepy-head,     Late at night to go to bed.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     IN PORT       Last, to the chamber where I lie     My fearful footsteps patter nigh,     And come from out the cold and gloom     Into my warm and cheerful room.      There, safe arrived, we turn about     To keep the coming shadows out,     And close the happy door at last     On all the perils that we passed.      Then, when mamma goes by to bed,     She shall come in with tip-toe tread,     And see me lying warm and fast     And in the Land of Nod at last.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     NIGHT AND DAY       When the golden day is done,       Through the closing portal,     Child and garden, flower and sun,       Vanish all things mortal.      As the blinding showers fall,       As the rays diminish,     Under evening's cloak they all       Roll away and vanish.      Garden darkened, daisy shut,       Child in bed, they slumber--     Glow-worm in the highway rut,       Mice among the lumber.      In the darkness houses shine,         Parents move with candles     Till on all, the night divine         Turns the bedroom handles.      Till at last the day begins         In the east a-breaking,     In the hedges and the whins         Sleeping birds a-waking.      In the darkness shapes of things,         Houses, trees and hedges,     Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings         Beat on window ledges.      These shall wake the yawning maid,         She the door shall open--     Finding dew on garden glade         And the morning broken.      There my garden grows again         Green and rosy painted,     As at eve behind the pane         From my eyes it fainted.      Just as it was shut away,         Toy-like, in the even,     Here I see it glow with day         Under glowing heaven.      Every path and every plot,         Every bush of roses,     Every blue forget-me-not         Where the dew reposes.      'Up! they cry, 'the day is come         On the smiling valleys;     We have beat the morning drum;         Playmate, join your allies!'  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     NEST EGGS       Birds all the sunny day       Flutter and quarrel     Here in the arbor-like       Tent of the laurel.      Here in the fork       The brown nest is seated;     Four little blue eggs       The mother keeps heated.      While we stand watching her,       Staring like gabies,     Safe in each egg are the       Bird's little babies.      Soon the frail eggs they shall       Chip, and upspringing     Make all the April woods       Merry with singing.      Younger than we are,       O children, and frailer,     Soon in blue air they'll be,       Singer and sailor.      We, so much older,       Taller and stronger,     We shall look down on the       Birdies no longer.      They shall go flying       With musical speeches     High over head in the       Tops of the beeches.      In spite of our wisdom       And sensible talking,     We on our feet must go       Plodding and walking.  [Illustration]     THE FLOWERS       All the names I know from nurse:     Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,     Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,     And the Lady Hollyhock.      Fairy places, fairy things,     Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,     Tiny trees for tiny dames--     These must all be fairy names!      Tiny woods below whose boughs     Shady fairies weave a house;     Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,     Where the braver fairies climb!      Fair are grown-up people's trees,     But the fairest woods are these;     Where if I were not so tall,     I should live for good and all.  [Illustration]     FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE       Faster than fairies, faster than witches,     Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;     And charging along like troops in a battle,     All through the meadows the horses and cattle:     All of the sights of the hill and the plain     Fly as thick as driving rain;     And ever again in the wink of an eye,     Painted stations whistle by.      Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,     All by himself and gathering brambles;     Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;     And there is the green for stringing the daisies!     Here is a cart run away in the road     Lumping along with man and load;     And here is a mill and there is a river,     Each a glimpse and gone forever!  [Illustration]     MY TREASURES       These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest     Where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest,     Were gathered in autumn by nursie and me     In a wood with a well by the side of the sea.      This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!)     By the side of a field at the end of the grounds.     Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own,     It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone!      The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey,     We discovered I cannot tell _how_ far away;     And I carried it back although weary and cold,     For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold.      But of all of my treasures the last is the king,     For there's very few children possess such a thing;     And that is a chisel, both handle and blade,     Which a man who was really a carpenter made.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     BLOCK CITY       What are you able to build with your blocks?     Castles and palaces, temples and docks.     Rain may keep raining and others go roam,     But I can be happy and building at home.      Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,     There I'll establish a city for me:     A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,     And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride.      Great is the palace with pillar and wall,     A sort of a tower on the top of it all,     And steps coming down in an orderly way     To where my toy vessels lay safe in the bay.      This one is sailing and that one is moored:     Hark to the song of the sailors on board!     And see the steps of my palace, the kings     Coming and going with presents and things!      Now I have done with it, down let it go!     All in a moment the town is laid low.     Block upon block lying scattered and free,     What is there left of my town by the sea?      Yet as I saw it, I see it again,     The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men     And as long as I live and where'er I may be,     I'll always remember my town by the sea.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE GARDENER       The gardener does not love to talk,     He makes me keep the gravel walk;     And when he puts his tools away,     He locks the door and takes the key.      Away behind the currant row     Where no one else but cook may go,     Far in the plots, I see him dig,     Old and serious, brown and big.      He digs the flowers, green, red and blue,     Nor wishes to be spoken to.     He digs the flowers and cuts the hay,     And never seems to want to play.      Silly gardener! summer goes,     And winter comes with pinching toes,     When in the garden bare and brown     You must lay your barrow down.      Well now, and while the summer stays,     To profit by these garden days,     O how much wiser you would be     To play at Indian wars with me!
