HIPPOLYTUS           Could I say more,           Without exposing him to dire disgrace?           How should I venture, by revealing all,           To make a father's brow grow red with shame?           The odious mystery to you alone           Is known. My heart has been outpour'd to none           Save you and Heav'n. I could not hide from you           (Judge if I love you), all I fain would hide           E'en from myself. But think under what seal           I spoke. Forget my words, if that may be;           And never let so pure a mouth disclose           This dreadful secret. Let us trust to Heav'n           My vindication, for the gods are just;           For their own honour will they clear the guiltless;           Sooner or later punish'd for her crime,           Phaedra will not escape the shame she merits.           I ask no other favour than your silence;           In all besides I give my wrath free scope.           Make your escape from this captivity,           Be bold to bear me company in flight;           Linger not here on this accursed soil,           Where virtue breathes a pestilential air.           To cover your departure take advantage           Of this confusion, caused by my disgrace.           The means of flight are ready, be assured;           You have as yet no other guards than mine.           Pow'rful defenders will maintain our quarrel;           Argos spreads open arms, and Sparta calls us.           Let us appeal for justice to our friends,           Nor suffer Phaedra, in a common ruin           Joining us both, to hunt us from the throne,           And aggrandise her son by robbing us.           Embrace this happy opportunity:           What fear restrains? You seem to hesitate.           Your interest alone prompts me to urge           Boldness. When I am all on fire, how comes it           That you are ice? Fear you to follow then           A banish'd man?            ARICIA           Ah, dear to me would be           Such exile! With what joy, my fate to yours           United, could I live, by all the world           Forgotten! but not yet has that sweet tie           Bound us together. How then can I steal           Away with you? I know the strictest honour           Forbids me not out of your father's hands           To free myself; this is no parent's home,           And flight is lawful when one flies from tyrants.           But you, Sir, love me; and my virtue shrinks--            HIPPOLYTUS           No, no, your reputation is to me           As dear as to yourself. A nobler purpose           Brings me to you. Fly from your foes, and follow           A husband. Heav'n, that sends us these misfortunes,           Sets free from human instruments the pledge           Between us. Torches do not always light           The face of Hymen.           At the gates of Troezen,           'Mid ancient tombs where princes of my race           Lie buried, stands a temple, ne'er approach'd           By perjurers, where mortals dare not make           False oaths, for instant punishment befalls           The guilty. Falsehood knows no stronger check           Than what is present there--the fear of death           That cannot be avoided. Thither then           We'll go, if you consent, and swear to love           For ever, take the guardian god to witness           Our solemn vows, and his paternal care           Entreat. I will invoke the name of all           The holiest Pow'rs; chaste Dian, and the Queen           Of Heav'n, yea all the gods who know my heart           Will guarantee my sacred promises.            ARICIA           The King draws near. Depart,--make no delay.           To mask my flight, I linger yet one moment.           Go you; and leave with me some trusty guide,           To lead my timid footsteps to your side.              SCENE II           THESEUS, ARICIA, ISMENE             THESEUS           Ye gods, throw light upon my troubled mind,           Show me the truth which I am seeking here.            ARICIA (aside to ISMENE)           Get ready, dear Ismene, for our flight.              SCENE III           THESEUS, ARICIA             THESEUS           Your colour comes and goes, you seem confused,           Madame! What business had my son with you?            ARICIA           Sire, he was bidding me farewell for ever.            THESEUS           Your eyes, it seems, can tame that stubborn pride;           And the first sighs he breathes are paid to you.            ARICIA           I can't deny the truth; he has not, Sire,           Inherited your hatred and injustice;           He did not treat me like a criminal.            THESEUS           That is to say, he swore eternal love.           Do not rely on that inconstant heart;           To others has he sworn as much before.            ARICIA           He, Sire?            THESEUS           You ought to check his roving taste.           How could you bear a partnership so vile?            ARICIA           And how can you endure that vilest slanders           Should make a life so pure as black as pitch?           Have you so little knowledge of his heart?           Do you so ill distinguish between guilt           And innocence? What mist before your eyes           Blinds them to virtue so conspicuous?           Ah! 'tis too much to let false tongues defame him.           Repent; call back your murderous wishes, Sire;           Fear, fear lest Heav'n in its severity           Hate you enough to hear and grant your pray'rs.           Oft in their wrath the gods accept our victims,           And oftentimes chastise us with their gifts.            THESEUS           No, vainly would you cover up his guilt.           Your love is blind to his depravity.           But I have witness irreproachable:           Tears have I seen, true tears, that may be trusted.            ARICIA           Take heed, my lord. Your hands invincible           Have rid the world of monsters numberless;           But all are not destroy'd, one you have left           Alive--Your son forbids me to say more.           Knowing with what respect he still regards you,           I should too much distress him if I dared           Complete my sentence. I will imitate           His reverence, and, to keep silence, leave you.              SCENE IV             THESEUS (alone)           What is there in her mind? What meaning lurks           In speech begun but to be broken short?           Would both deceive me with a vain pretence?           Have they conspired to put me to the torture?           And yet, despite my stern severity,           What plaintive voice cries deep within my heart?           A secret pity troubles and alarms me.           Oenone shall be questioned once again,           I must have clearer light upon this crime.           Guards, bid Oenone come, and come alone.              SCENE V           THESEUS, PANOPE             PANOPE           I know not what the Queen intends to do,           But from her agitation dread the worst.           Fatal despair is painted on her features;           Death's pallor is already in her face.           Oenone, shamed and driven from her sight,           Has cast herself into the ocean depths.           None knows what prompted her to deed so rash;           And now the waves hide her from us for ever.            THESEUS           What say you?            PANOPE           Her sad fate seems to have added           Fresh trouble to the Queen's tempestuous soul.           Sometimes, to soothe her secret pain, she clasps           Her children close, and bathes them with her tears;           Then suddenly, the mother's love forgotten,           She thrusts them from her with a look of horror,           She wanders to and fro with doubtful steps;           Her vacant eye no longer knows us. Thrice           She wrote, and thrice did she, changing her mind,           Destroy the letter ere 'twas well begun.           Vouchsafe to see her, Sire: vouchsafe to help her.            THESEUS           Heav'ns! Is Oenone dead, and Phaedra bent           On dying too? Oh, call me back my son!           Let him defend himself, and I am ready           To hear him. Be not hasty to bestow           Thy fatal bounty, Neptune; let my pray'rs           Rather remain ever unheard. Too soon           I lifted cruel hands, believing lips           That may have lied! Ah! What despair may follow!              SCENE VI           THESEUS, THERAMENES             THESEUS           Theramenes, is't thou? Where is my son?           I gave him to thy charge from tenderest childhood.           But whence these tears that overflow thine eyes?           How is it with my son?            THERAMENES           Concern too late!           Affection vain! Hippolytus is dead.            THESEUS           Gods!            THERAMENES           I have seen the flow'r of all mankind           Cut off, and I am bold to say that none           Deserved it less.            THESEUS           What! My son dead! When I           Was stretching out my arms to him, has Heav'n           Hasten'd his end? What was this sudden stroke?            THERAMENES           Scarce had we pass'd out of the gates of Troezen,           He silent in his chariot, and his guards           Downcast and silent too, around him ranged;           To the Mycenian road he turn'd his steeds,           Then, lost in thought, allow'd the reins to lie           Loose on their backs. His noble chargers, erst           So full of ardour to obey his voice,           With head depress'd and melancholy eye           Seem'd now to mark his sadness and to share it.           A frightful cry, that issues from the deep,           With sudden discord rends the troubled air;           And from the bosom of the earth a groan           Is heard in answer to that voice of terror.

Publishers New York.                Copyright 1903 by                  W.W.Denslow.              Published, August 1903                 To Mazie La Shelle  [Illustration: THE THREE BEARS.]   A long time ago in a cottage on the edge of a great forest there dwelt a little girl by the name of Golden Hair; she was an orphan and lived with her grandmother who loved her dearly. The grandmother was very old and so most of the house work was done by Golden Hair; but she was so young and strong she did not mind that a bit, for she had plenty of time to play and was merry the whole day long.  Although little Golden Hair lived far from other children she was never lonesome, for she had many friends and playmates in the wild creatures of the wood. The gentle, soft eyed deer would feed from her hand, and the wild birds would come at her musical call; for she knew their language and loved them well.  Golden Hair had never wandered far into the forest. But one day in the early autumn time, as she was gathering bright leaves and golden rod, she strayed farther than she knew and came upon a lonely, gray cabin under the mighty trees. A slab of wood beside the half open door told who lived within. It read:  \"Papa Bear, Mamma Bear, and the Tiny Bear.\"  [Illustration]  \"So this is where the jolly bears live!\" said Golden Hair, as she knocked upon the door. \"I want to meet them.\"  No answer came to her knocking, so she pushed the door wide open and walked in.  It was a most disorderly house, but a bright fire burned on the hearth, over which hung a big, black kettle of bubbling soup, while on the table, near by, were three yellow bowls of different sizes.  \"A big bowl for Papa Bear, a medium sized bowl for Mamma Bear, and a little bowl for the Tiny Bear,\" said Golden Hair.  \"That soup smells good,\" she went on to say, \"but my! what an untidy house! I'll put the place to rights while I am waiting for the bears to come home.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So she went to work to sweep and dust and soon had the room in order. Then she went into the bed room and made up the three beds: the big one for Papa Bear, the medium sized one for Mamma Bear, and the little one for the Tiny Bear; she bustled and had everything as neat as a pin when in bounced the three jolly bears. For a moment the bears stood speechless, with wide open eyes, staring at Golden Hair, who stood, like a ray of sunshine in the dusky room; then they burst into loud laughter and made her welcome to their home. When they saw how nice and clean it was they thanked her heartily and invited her to share their dinner, for the soup was now ready and they were all hungry. Golden Hair spent the rest of the day with the three jolly bears playing \"hi spy\" and many new games which the bears taught her.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  When the afternoon sun was sinking in the west the little girl said she must be getting home, for her grandma would be anxious about her. The three bears would not let her go alone, so they all set off together through the twilight woods,--a merry company.  Golden Hair rode upon the broad back of Papa Bear, while Mamma Bear and Tiny walked gaily on either side. In this way, before night had fallen, they came clear of the wood and up to the home of Golden Hair.  [Illustration]  To be sure the grandmother was much surprised to see this shaggy company with her little Golden Hair; but when she saw how jolly they all were and how handy they were in helping Golden Hair get the supper, she was delighted to have them stay, and gave them welcome. Papa Bear split the wood, brought it in, and built the fire; Mamma Bear got the tea kettle and filled it with water that was carried from the well by the Tiny Bear, and soon they were able to sit down to a good supper of hot biscuit, wild honey and pumpkin pie, with tea for the elders and nice sweet milk for Golden Hair and the Tiny Bear.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The grandmother liked the three bears so well and the bears were so delighted with the comforts of home that they all decided to live together for the general good.  Papa Bear would do the chores and stand guard over the house at night; Mamma Bear would do the housework under the direction of Golden Hair, while the Tiny Bear would wait upon grandmother and run errands for the household.  [Illustration]  And so it came about that the three bears moved their three bowls and their three beds to the home of Golden Hair and her grandmother, the very next day; and from all accounts they were happy ever after. At any rate the fame of Golden Hair and the three bears spread far and wide through all the countryside, so that on holidays troops of children came to play with the four jolly friends.  The good natured bears were always anxious to please the children; they would get up games under the greenwood trees in the summer, and merry sports upon the icy lake or snowy hills in winter. They did their best to make life for all, one glad round of joy. Just how long they lived thus, no one seems to know; for it was a long, long time ago and nothing is left but a joyous memory of a happy golden time.
