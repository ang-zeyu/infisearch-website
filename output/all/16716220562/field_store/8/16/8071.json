On stringed instruments of the violin family the staccato      effect is usually secured by a long, rapid stroke of the bow      for each tone; in the case of harp and drum the hand is      quickly brought in contact with the vibrating body, thus      stopping the tone instantly. On the organ the tone is often      prolonged to one-half the value of the printed note before the      keys are released.  53. _The wedge-shaped dash over the note_ (staccatissimo) was formerly employed to indicate a tone still more detached than that indicated by the dot, but this sign is really superfluous, and is seldom used at present. [Illustration]  54. _A tie_ is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes that call for the same tone. It indicates that they are to be sounded as one tone having a duration equal to the combined value of both notes. _E.g._, a half-note tied to a quarter-note would indicate a tone equal in duration-length to that shown by a dotted half-note; two half-notes tied would indicate a tone equal in duration to that shown by a whole-note. (See examples under Sections 49, 50, and 51).  Fig. 30 illustrates the more common variety of tie, while Fig. 31 shows an example of the _enharmonic[10] tie_.  [Footnote 10: For definition of enharmonic see p. 10, Sec. 27.]  [Illustration: Fig. 30.]  [Illustration: Fig. 31.]  55. The _slur_ is used in so many different ways that it is impossible to give a general definition. It consists of a curved line, sometimes very short (in which case it looks like the tie), but sometimes very long, connecting ten, fifteen, or more notes. Some of the more common uses of the slur are:  A. _To indicate legato_ (sustained or connected) _tones_, as contrasted with staccato (detached) ones.       In violin music this implies playing all tones thus slurred in      one bow; in music for the voice and for wind instruments it      implies singing or playing them in one breath.  B. _As a phrase-mark_, in the interpretation of which the first tone of the phrase is often accented slightly, and the last one shortened in value.       This interpretation of the phrase is especially common when      the phrase is short (as in the two-note phrase), and when the      tones constituting the phrase are of short duration, _e.g._,      the phrase given in Fig. 32 would be played approximately as      written in Fig. 33.  [Illustration: Fig. 32.]  [Illustration: Fig. 33.]       But if the notes are of greater value, especially in slow      tempi, the slur merely indicates legato, _i.e._, sustained or      connected rendition. Fig. 34 illustrates such a case.       [Illustration: Fig. 34.]       This is a matter of such diverse usage that it is difficult to      generalize regarding it. The tendency seems at present to be      in the direction of using the slur (_in instrumental music_)      as a phrase-mark exclusively, it being understood that unless      there is some direction to the contrary, the tones are to be      performed in a connected manner.  C. In vocal music, to show that two or more tones are to be sung to one syllable of text. See Fig. 35.  [Illustration: Fig. 35. MENDELSSOHN (_S. Paul_) re-mem-bers His chil-dren.]       In notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) this same      thing is often indicated by _stroking_ the stems together as      in Fig. 36. This can only be done in cases where the natural      grouping of notes in the measure will not be destroyed.  [Illustration: Fig. 36. ev-er and ev-er, for ev-er and]  D. To mark special note-groups (triplets, etc.), in which case the slur is accompanied by a figure indicating the number of notes in the group. See Fig. 37 (_a_)       The most common of these irregular note-groups is the      _triplet_, which consists of three notes to be performed in      the time ordinarily given to two of the same value. Sometimes      the triplet consists of only two notes as in Fig. 37 (_b_). In      such a case the first two of the three notes composing the      triplet are considered to be tied.       [Illustration: Fig. 37.]       When the triplet form is perfectly obvious, the Fig. 3 (as      well as the slur) may be omitted.       Other examples of irregular note-groups, together with the      names commonly applied, follow.       [Illustration: Doublet. Quintuplet or Quintolet. Sextuplet or      Sextolet. Septolet or Septimole.]  56. The _combination of slur or tie and dots_ over the notes indicates that the tones are to be somewhat detached, but not sharply so. [Illustration]       This effect is sometimes erroneously termed _portamento_ (lit.      _carrying_), but this term is more properly reserved for an      entirely different effect, _viz._, when a singer, or player on      a stringed instrument, passes from a high tone to a low one      (or vice versa) touching lightly on some or all of the      diatonic tones between the two melody tones.  57. The horizontal _dash over a note_ [Illustration] indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented, and sustained. This mark is also sometimes used after a staccato passage to show that the tones are no longer to be performed in detached fashion, but are to be sustained. This latter use is especially common in music for stringed instruments.  58. The combination of _dash and dot over a note_ [Illustration] indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented and separated from its neighboring tones.  59. _Accent marks_ are made in a variety of fashions. The most common forms follow. [horizontal accent symbol] [vertical accent symbol] _sf_ _fz_. All indicate that a certain tone or chord is to be differentiated from its neighboring tones or chords by receiving a certain relative amount of stress.  60. In music for keyboard instruments it is sometimes necessary to indicate that a certain part is to be played by a certain hand. The abbreviations r.h. (right hand), m.d. (mano destra, It.), and m.d. (main droite, Fr.), designate that a passage or tone is to be played with the right hand, while l.h. (left hand), m.s. (mano sinistra, It.), and m.g. (main gauche, Fr.), show that the left hand is to be employed.  61. _The wavy line placed vertically beside a chord_ [Illustration] indicates that the tones are to be sounded consecutively instead of simultaneously, beginning with the lowest tone, all tones being sustained until the duration-value of the chord has expired. This is called _arpeggio playing_. When the wavy line extends through the entire chord (covering both staffs) as in Fig. 38, all the tones of the chord are to be played one after another, beginning with the lowest: but if there is a separate wavy line for each staff as at Fig. 39 then the lowest tone represented on the upper staff is to be played simultaneously with the lowest tone represented on the bass staff.  [Illustration: Fig. 38.]  [Illustration: Fig. 39.]       The word arpeggio (plural arpeggi) is a derivation of the      Italian word _arpa_ (meaning harp), and from this word _arpa_      and its corresponding verb _arpeggiare_ (to play on the harp)      are derived also a number of other terms commonly used in      instrumental music. Among these are--arpeggiamento,      arpeggiando, arpeggiato, etc., all of these terms referring to      a _harp style_ of performance, the tones being sounded one      after another in rapid succession instead of simultaneously as      on the piano.  62. The sign [crescendo-decrescendo symbol] over a note indicates that the tone is to be begun softly, gradually increased in power, and as gradually decreased again, ending as softly as it began. In vocal music this effect is called _messa di voce_.  63. In music for stringed instruments of the violin family, the sign [down-bow symbol] indicates down-bow and the sign [up-bow symbol] up-bow. In cello music the down-bow sign is sometimes written [cello down-bow symbol].     CHAPTER VI  EMBELLISHMENTS   64. _Embellishments (or graces) (Fr. agr√©ments_) are ornamental tones, either represented in full in the score or indicated by certain signs. The following are the embellishments most commonly found: Trill (or shake), mordent, inverted mordent (or prall trill), turn (gruppetto), inverted turn, appoggiatura and acciaccatura.  Usage varies greatly in the interpretation of the signs representing these embellishments and it is impossible to give examples of all the different forms. The following definitions represent therefore only the most commonly found examples and the most generally accepted interpretations.  65. The _trill (or shake_) consists of the rapid alternation of two tones to the full value of the printed note. The lower of these two tones is represented by the printed note, while the upper one is the next higher tone in the diatonic scale of the key in which the composition is written. The interval between the two tones may therefore be either a half-step or a whole-step.       Whether the trill is to begin with the principal tone      (represented by the printed note) or with the one above is a      matter of some dispute among theorists and performers, but it      may safely be said that the majority of modern writers on the      subject would have it begin on the principal tone rather than      on the tone above. Fig. 40.       When the principal note is preceded by a small note on the      degree above, it is of course understood that the trill begins      on the tone above. Fig. 41.  The trill is indicated by the sign [trill symbol].  [Illustration: Fig. 40.]  [Illustration: Fig. 41.]  The above examples would be termed _perfect trills_ because they close with a turn. By inference, an _imperfect trill_ is one closing without a turn.  66. The _mordent_ [mordent symbol] consists of three tones; first the one represented by the printed note; second the one next below it in the diatonic scale; third the one represented by the printed note again.  [Illustration: Fig. 42.]  67. The _double (or long) mordent_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],["title","Music Notation and Terminology (#5)"],["body","five tones (sometimes seven) instead of three, the first two of the three tones of the regular mordent being repeated once or more. (See Fig. 43.)  In the case of both mordent and double-mordent the tones are sounded as quickly as possible, the time taken by the embellishment being subtracted from the value of the principal note as printed.  [Illustration: Fig. 43.]  68. The _inverted mordent_ [inverted mordent symbol] (note the absence of the vertical line) is like the mordent except that the tone below is replaced by the tone above in each case. This ornament is sometimes called a \"transient shake\" because it is really only a part of the more elaborate grace called \"trill.\" (See Fig. 44.)  [Illustration: Fig. 44.]       The confusion at present attending the interpretation of the      last two embellishments described, might be largely obviated      if the suggestion of a recent writer[11] to call the one the      _upward mordent_, and the other the _downward mordent_ were to      be universally adopted.  [Footnote 11: Elson--Dictionary of Music, article _mordent_.]  69. The _turn_ consists of four tones; first, the diatonic scale-tone above the principal tone; second, the principal tone itself; third, the tone below the principal tone; and fourth, the principal tone again.  When the sign ([turn symbol] or [fancy turn symbol]) occurs over a note of small value in rapid tempo (Fig. 45) the turn consists of four tones of equal value; but if it occurs over a note of greater value, or in a slow tempo, the tones are usually played quickly (like the mordent), and the fourth tone is then held until the time-value of the note has expired. (Fig. 46.)  [Illustration: Fig. 45.]  [Illustration: Fig. 46.]  70. _When the turn-sign is placed a little to the right of the note_ the principal tone is sounded first and held to almost its full time-value, then the turn is played just before the next tone of the melody. In this case the four tones are of equal length as in the first example. (See Fig. 47.)  [Illustration: Fig. 47.]       The student should note the difference between these two      effects; in the case of a turn _over_ the note the turn comes      at the beginning, but in the case of the sign _after_ the note      the turn comes at the very end. But in both cases the time      taken by the embellishment is taken from the time-value of      the principal note. For further details see Grove's Dictionary      of Music and Musicians, Vol. V, p. 184. Also Elson, op. cit.      p. 274.  71. Sometimes an accidental occurs with the turn, and in this case when written above the sign it refers to the highest tone of the turn, but when written below, to the lowest (Fig. 48).  [Illustration: Fig. 48.]  72. In the _inverted turn_ the order of tones is reversed, the lowest one coming first, the principal tone next, the highest tone third, and the principal tone again, last.  [Illustration: Fig. 49.]  73. The _appoggiatura_ (lit. _leaning note_) consists of an ornamental tone introduced before a tone of a melody, thus delaying the melody tone until the ornamental tone has been heard. The time taken for this ornamental tone is taken from that of the melody tone.       The appoggiatura was formerly classified into _long      appoggiatura_ and _short appoggiatura_, but modern writers      seem to consider the term \"short appoggiatura\" to be      synonymous with acciaccatura[12], and to avoid confusion the      word _acciaccatura_ will be used in this sense, and defined      under its own heading.  [Footnote 12: In organ music the acciaccatura is still taken to mean that the embellishing tone and the melody tone are to be sounded together, the former being then instantly released, while the latter is held to its full time-value.]  74. Three rules for the interpretation of the appoggiatura are commonly cited, viz.:       (1) When it is possible to divide the principal tone into      halves, then the appoggiatura receives one-half the value of      the printed note. (Fig. 50.)       (2) When the principal note is dotted (division into halves      being therefore not possible), the appoggiatura receives      two-thirds of the value. (Fig. 51.)       (3) When the principal note is tied to a note of smaller      denomination the appoggiatura receives the value of the first      of the two notes. (Fig. 52.)  [Illustration: Fig. 50.]  [Illustration: Fig. 51.]  [Illustration: Fig. 52.]  75. The _acciaccatura_ (or short appoggiatura) is written like the appoggiatura except that it has a light stroke across its stem. [Illustration] It has no definite duration-value, but is sounded as quickly as possible, taking its time from that of the principal tone. The appoggiatura is always accented, but the acciaccatura never is, the stress always falling on the melody tone. (See Grove, op. cit. Vol. I, p. 96.)       The use of embellishments is on the wane, and the student of      to-day needs the above information only to aid him in the      interpretation of music written in previous centuries. In the      early days of instrumental music it was necessary to introduce      graces of all sorts because the instruments in use were not      capable of sustaining tone for any length of time; but with      the advent of the modern piano with its comparatively great      sustaining power, and also with the advent in vocal music of a      new style of singing (German Lieder singing as contrasted with      Italian coloratura singing), ornamental tones were used less      and less, and when found now are usually written out in full      in the score instead of being indicated by signs.     CHAPTER VII  SCALES   76. A _scale_ (from _scala_, a Latin word meaning _ladder_; Ger. _Ton-leiter_) is an ascending or descending series of tones, progressing according to some definite system, and all bearing (in the case of tonality scales at least) a very intimate relation to the first tone--the _key-tone_ or _tonic_. (See p. 28, Sec. 78; also note 1 at bottom of p. 38.)       Many different kinds of scales have existed in various musical      eras, the point of resemblance among them all being the fact      that they have all more or less recognized the _octave_ as the      natural limit of the series. The difference among the various      scales has been in the selection of intervals between the      scale-tones, and, consequently, in the number of tones within      the octave. Thus _e.g._, in our major scale the intervals      between the tones are all whole-steps except two (which are      half-steps), and the result is a scale of _eight_ tones      (including in this number both the key-tone and its octave):      but in the so-called _pentatonic_ scale of the Chinese and      other older civilizations we find larger intervals (_e.g._,      the step-and-a-half), and consequently a smaller number of      tones within the octave. Thus in the scale upon which many of      the older Scotch folk songs are based the intervals are      arranged as follows:       1  whole  2  whole  3  step-and-  4  whole  5  step-and-  6         step      step      a-half        step      a-half       The result is a scale of six tones, corresponding      approximately with C--D--E--G--A--C in our modern system.       The term _pentatonic_ is thus seen to be a misnomer since the      sixth tone is necessary for the completion of the series, just      as the eighth tone is essential in our diatonic scales.       The following Chinese tune (called \"Jasmine\") is based on the      pentatonic scale.       [Illustration]  77. In studying the theory of the scale the student should bear in mind the fact that a scale is not an arbitrary series of tones which some one has invented, and which others are required to make use of. It is rather the result of accustoming the ear to certain melodic combinations (which were originally hit upon by accident), and finally analyzing and systematizing these combinations into a certain definite order or arrangement. The application of this idea may be verified when it is recalled that most primitive peoples have invented melodies of some sort, but that only in modern times, and particularly since the development of instrumental music, have these melodies been analyzed, and the scale upon which they have been based, discovered, the inventors of the melodies being themselves wholly ignorant of the existence of such scales.  78. A _key_ is a number of tones grouping themselves naturally (both melodically and harmonically) about a central tone--the key tone. The word _tonality_ is often used synonymously with _key_ in this sense.       The difference between _key_ and _scale_ is therefore this,      that while both _key_ and _scale_ employ the same tone      material, by _key_ we mean the material in general, without      any particular order or arrangement in mind, while by _scale_      we mean the same tones, but now arranged into a regular      ascending or descending series. It should be noted in this      connection also that not all scales present an equally good      opportunity of having their tones used as a basis for tonality      or key-feeling: neither the chromatic nor the whole-step scale      possess the necessary characteristics for being used as      tonality scales in the same sense that our major and minor      scales are so used.  79. There are _three general classes of scales_ extant at the present time, viz.: (1) Diatonic; (2) Chromatic; (3) Whole-tone.[13]  [Footnote 13: If strictly logical terminology is to be insisted upon the whole-tone scale should be called the \"whole-step\" scale.]  80. The word _diatonic_ means \"through the tones\" (_i.e._, through the tones of the key), and is applied to both major and minor scales of our modern tonality system. In general a diatonic scale may be defined as one which proceeds by half-steps and whole-steps. There is, however, one exception to this principle, viz., in the progression six to seven in the "]]]
