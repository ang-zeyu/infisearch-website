The other boys looked at each other, puzzled. The girl looked half incredulously at Pee-wee and something in his manner gave her a feeling of hope. Most of the others laughed good-humoredly.  They hauled the nozzle end of a garden hose from where it lay coiled near a faucet in the stone foundation. Pee-wee took the nozzle and began to play the stream against the trunk of the tree, all the while looking up at the parrot. Presently, the bird began to \"sit up and take notice,\" as one might say. It was plainly interested. The bystanders began to \"sit up and take notice\" too, and they watched the bird intently as it cocked its head and listened. Pee-wee sent the stream a little higher up the trunk and as he did so the bird became greatly excited. It began uttering, in the modulated form consonant with its size, the discordant squawk of the parrot. The little girl watched eagerly.  \"Get the cage,\" ordered Pee-wee.  Roy brought it and laid it at his feet. The stream played a little higher, and the bird chattered furiously and came lower.  \"Remind you of home?\" Pee-wee asked, looking up and playing the water a little higher. The bystanders watched, in silence. The bird was now upon the lowest branch, chattering like mad and flapping its wings frantically. The little girl, in an ecstasy of fresh hope, called to it and danced up and down.  But Pee-wee, like a true artist, neither saw nor heard his audience. He was playing the bird with this line of water as an angler plays a fish. And never was moth lured by a flame more irresistibly than this little green fugitive was lured by the splashing of that stream.  \"Oh, can you catch him? Can you catch him?\" pleaded the girl as she clutched Pee-wee's arm.  \"Let go a minute,\" said Pee-wee. \"Now, all stand back, here goes!\"  He shot the stream suddenly down at the base of the tree, holding the nozzle close so that the plashing was loud and the spray diffused. And as an arrow goes to its mark the bird came swooping down plunk into the middle of the spray and puddle. Still playing the stream with one hand, Pee-wee reached carefully and with his other gently encircled the little drenched body.  \"Quite an adventure, wasn't it, Greenie?\" he said. \"Where'd you think you were? In the tropics?---- If you ever want to take hold of a bird,\" he added, turning to the girl, \"hold it this way; make a ring out of your thumb and first finger, and let his stomach rest on the palm of your hand. Be sure your hand isn't cold, though. Here you are--that's right.\"  The girl could hardly speak. She stood with her dwarf parrot in her hand, looking at the stream of water which was now shooting silently through the grass and at the puddle which it had made, and she felt that a miracle had been performed before her eyes. Roy, hardly less pleased than she, stepped forward and turned off the water.  \"Good work,\" said a gentleman. \"I've seen many a bird brought down, but never in that fashion before.\"  \"_We_ don't use the other fashion,\" said Tom, with a touch of pride as he put his hand on Pee-wee's shoulder. \"Do we, kid?\"  \"If it was a canary,\" said Pee-wee, \"I might possibly have whistled him down, but not near enough to catch him, I guess. But as soon as I knew that bird came from the tropics, I knew he'd fall for water, 'cause a tropical bird'll go where the sound of water is every time. I guess it's because they have so many showers down there, or something. Then once I heard that it's best to turn on the faucet when you're teaching a parrot to talk. It's the sound of water. Did you get any water on you?\" he asked, suddenly turning to the child.  There was no water on her clothing, but there was some in her eyes.  \"I--I--think you're wonderful,\" she said. \"I think you are just wonderful!\"  \"'Twasn't me,\" said Pee-wee, \"it was the water. Gee,\" he added confidentially, \"I often said I hated water, and I do hate a rainy day. And if you get any water in a carburetor--_goo-od-night_! But I got to admit water's good for some things.\"  \"Oh, I want you please to wait--just a few minutes--I want to go and speak to my father,\" the girl said, as the boys started to move away. They were the only ones left now. \"Please wait just a minute.\"  \"We're on our way to Nyack,\" said Roy, suspecting her intention, \"and I'm afraid we've lost as much time as we dare. We've got to do a little shopping there and our weather prophet here thinks we're going to have a _real_ tropical shower before long.\"  \"But won't you let my father give you each--something? You've been so good and it's--oh--it's just _wonderful_!\"  \"Pee-wee, you're the doctor,\" said Roy.  \"I got to do a good turn every day,\" said the \"doctor,\" \"because we're scouts and that's the rule. If we took anything for it, why, then it wouldn't be a good turn. It would spoil all the fun. We're going on a long hike, up the Hudson to our camp. We don't want to go near railroad trains--and things like that. These fellows are taking me with them; that's a good turn, but if somebody paid 'em to do it, it wouldn't be a good turn, would it? I'm thankful to you and your parrot that you gave me the chance. Now I don't have to think of a good turn again till tomorrow. Besides I just happened to know about parrots and water so it's no credit to me.\"  That was it--he just happened to know! It was one of the dozens of things that he \"just happened to know.\" How he came by the knowledge was a mystery. But perhaps the best thing he knew was that a service is a service and that you knock it in the head as soon as you take payment for it.  The girl watched them, as they jumped the hedge, laughing gaily at Pee-wee's clumsiness and, waving their hats to her, took their belated way along the road.  It was not the most popular way of bringing down a bird, but there was no blood on Pee-wee's hands, and it was a pretty good stunt at that!     CHAPTER VI  THE SHELTER   \"Pee-wee, you're a wonder,\" said Roy. \"You're the only original Boy Scout; how did you get next to that stunt? What do you think of him, Tom?\"  \"Some wrinkle,\" said Tom.  \"Crinkums!\" said Pee-wee. \"I'm mighty glad I got him. If it hadn't succeeded I'd have felt cheap, sure; but when you're dealing with a girl, you always want to act as if you're sure of yourself. Do you know why?\"  \"Can't imagine,\" said Roy. \"Break it to us gently.\"  \"Because girls are never sure of themselves and they'll never take much stock in what you say unless you seem to be sure of yourself. That's one thing I've noticed. I've made a study of girls, kind of---- And you're more apt to succeed if there's a girl watching you--did you ever notice that?\"  Roy laughed.  \"It's so,\" urged Pee-wee. \"And there's another thing about girls, too; they're repulsive.\"  \"What?\" said Tom.  \"_What?_\" said Roy.  \"They say the first thing that comes into their heads.\"  \"_Im_pulsive, you mean,\" laughed Roy.  \"Well, they're all right on good turns,\" said Tom.  \"They don't have any good turns in the Camp Fire Girls,\" said Pee-wee.  \"A girl might do a good turn and you'd never know anything about it,\" said Tom, significantly.  \"Cracky,\" said Pee-wee, \"she was tickled to get that bird back.\"  In a little while they were tramping along the main street of Nyack, heading for the lordly Hudson. It was almost twilight, the shops were shutting their doors, and as they came around the hill which brought them face to face with the river, the first crimson glow of sunset fell upon the rippling current. Across the wide expanse, which seemed the wider for the little winding stream they had so lately followed, the hills were already turning from green to gray and tiny lights were visible upon the rugged heights. A great white steamer with its light already burning was plowing majestically upstream and the little open craft at the shore rocked in the diminishing ripples which it sent across the water, as though bowing in humble obeisance to it.  \"Gee, it's lonely, isn't it!\" said Pee-wee.  \"Not getting homesick, are you, kiddo?\"  \"No, but it seems kind of lonesome. I'm glad there's three of us. Oh, jiminy, look at those hills.\"  The scene was indeed such as to make the mightiest man feel insignificant.  The map showed a road which led to Haverstraw, and this the boys decided to follow until they should find a convenient spot in which to bivouac for the night. It followed the Hudson, sometimes running along the very brink with the mighty highlands rising above it and sometimes running between hills which shut the river from their view.  \"Hark,\" said Tom. \"What did I tell you! Thunder!\"  A low, distant rumble sounded, and as they paused in the gathering darkness, listening, a little fitful gust blew Pee-wee's hat off.  \"We're going to get a good dose of it,\" said Tom. \"I've been smelling it for the last hour; look at those trees.\"  The leaves were blowing this way and that.  \"We should worry,\" said Roy. \"Didn't I tell you we might have to get our feet wet? This is a risky bus----\"  \"Shut up!\" said Pee-wee.  They had walked not more than a quarter of a mile more when they came upon a stretch of road which was very muddy, with a piece of lowland bordering it. It was too dark to see clearly, but in the last remnant of daylight the boys could just distinguish a small, peculiar looking structure in the middle of this vast area.  \"That's a funny place to build a house,\" said Roy.  \"Maybe it's a fisherman's shack,\" Tom suggested.  Whatever it was, it was a most isolated and lonesome habitation, standing in the centre of that desert flat, shut in by the precipitous hills.  \"It would be a good place for a hermit,\" said Roy. \"You don't suppose anyone lives there, do you?\"  \"Cracky, wouldn't you like to be a hermit! Do you know what I'd like to have now----\"  \"An umbrella,\" interrupted Tom.  The remark, notwithstanding that it shocked Pee-wee's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19522"],["title","Tom Slade at Temple Camp (#6)"],["body"," of fitness, inasmuch as they were scouting and \"roughing it,\" was not inappropriate, for even as Tom spoke the patter of great drops was heard.  \"Maybe it's been raining here this afternoon,\" observed Tom, \"and that's what makes all this mud.\"  \"Well, it's certainly raining here now,\" said Roy. \"Me for that shack!\"  The rain suddenly came down in torrents and the boys turned up their collars and made a dash across the marshy land toward the shadowy structure. Roy reached it first and, turning, called: \"Hey, fellows, it's a boat!\"  The others, drenched, but laughing, followed him, scrambling upon the deck and over the combing into the cockpit of a dilapidated cabin launch.  \"What do you know about that!\" said Roy. \"Strike a light and let's see where we're at. I feel like a wet dish rag.\"  Presently Pee-wee's flashlight was poking its bright shaft this way and that as they looked curiously about them. They were in a neglected and disheveled, but very cosy, little cabin with sleeping lockers on either side and chintz curtains at the tiny portholes. A two-cylinder engine, so rusted that the wheel wouldn't turn over and otherwise in a dubious condition, was ineffectually covered by a piece of stiff and rotten oil cloth, the floor was cluttered with junk, industrious spiders had woven their webs all about and a frantic scurrying sound told of the hurried departure of some little animal which had evidently made its home in the forsaken hull.  \"Oh, but this is great!\" enthused Pee-wee. \"This is the kind of an adventure you read about; _now_ our adventures have really started.\"  \"It'll be more to the purpose if we can get our supper really started,\" said Roy.  \"How do you suppose it got here?\" Pee-wee asked.  \"That's easy,\" said Tom. \"I didn't realize it before, but the tide must come up over the road sometimes and flood all this land here. That's what makes the road muddy. There must have been a good high tide some time or other, and it brought the boat right up over the road and here it is, marooned.\"  \"Maybe it was the same flood that did all the damage down our way,\" Roy said. \"Well, here goes; get the things out, Pee-wee, and we'll have some eats. Gee, it's nice in here.\"  It _was_ nice. The rain pattered down on the low roof and beat against the little ports; the boat swayed a little in the heavier gusts of wind and all the delightful accompaniments of a life on the ocean wave were present--except the peril.  \"You get out the cooking things,\" said Roy, \"while I take a squint around and see if I can find something to kindle a fire in.\"  He did not have to go far. Sliding open the little hatch, he emerged into the cockpit, where the wind and rain smote him mercilessly. The storm had grown into a tempest and Roy wondered how it would be out on the wide river on such a night. In the cockpit was nothing but the shredded remnant of a sun awning and a couple of camp chairs, but a few feet from the boat something on the mushy ground cast a faint glimmer, and on going to it he found it to be a battered five-gallon gasoline can, which he brought back in triumph. By this time Tom and Pee-wee had the camp lamp burning and the supper things laid out. It was a very cosy scene.  \"See if there's a Stillson wrench in that locker,\" said Roy.  Among the rusted tools was a \"Stillson,\" and with this Roy disconnected the exhaust pipe from the engine. He next partly \"jabbed\" and partly cut a hole in the gasoline can of about the circumference of the pipe. A larger hole in the side of the can sufficed for a door and he squeezed the end of the exhaust pipe into the hole he had made for it, and presto! there was a very serviceable makeshift stove with the exhaust system of the engine converted into a draught and chimney.  \"The new patent Silver Fox cooking stove,\" said Roy. \"A scout is resourceful. This beats trying to kindle a fire outside, a night like this. Chuck that piece of wood over here.\"  There was an old battery box knocking about and this Roy whittled into shavings, while the others with their belt axes completed the ruin of the awning stanchions by chopping them into pieces a few inches long.  \"Guess they weren't good for much,\" observed Tom.  \"Oh,\" said Pee-wee, \"I'd just like to live in this boat.\"  It was no wonder he felt so. With the fire burning brightly in the old can and sending its smoke out through the boat's exhaust, the smell of the bacon cooking, the sight of their outer garments drying in the cheery warmth, while the wind howled outside and the rain beat down upon the low roof the situation was not half bad and an occasional lurch of the old hull gave a peculiar charm to their odd refuge.  \"Could you dally with a rice cake, kiddo?\" asked Roy, as he deftly stirred up some rice and batter. \"Sling me that egg powder, Tom, and give me something to stir with--not that, you gump, that's the fever thermometer!\"  \"Here's a fountain pen,\" said Pee-wee; \"will that do?\"  \"This screw-driver will be better,\" said Roy. \"Here, kiddo, make yourself useful and keep turning that in the pan. You're a specialist on good turns.\"  Pee-wee stirred, while Tom attended to the fire, and Roy to the cooking. And I might mention on the side that if you should happen to be marooned in a disused boat on a blustering night, and are ingenious enough (as Roy was) to contrive the cooking facilities, you cannot do better than flop a few rice cakes, watching carefully that they don't burn. You can flop them with a shoe horn if you've nothing better at hand.  They spread their balloon silk tent in the cockpit, holding fast to the corners until enough water had fallen into it to fill the coffee-pot, and they had three such cups of coffee as you never fancied in your fondest dreams.  For dessert they had \"Silver Fox Slump,\" an invention of Roy's made with chocolate, honey and, I think, horse-radish. It has to be stirred thoroughly. Pee-wee declared that it was such a _table d'hote_ dinner as he had never before tasted. He was always partial to the scout style of cooking and he added, \"You know how they have music at _table d'hote_ dinners. Well, this music's got it beat, that's one sure thing. Gee, I'll hate to leave the boat, I sure will.\"  The boisterous music gave very little prospect of ceasing, and after the three had talked for an hour or so, they settled down for the night, two on the lockers and one on the floor, with the wind still moaning and the rain coming down in torrents.  When they awoke in the morning the wind had died down somewhat, but it still blew fitfully out of the east and the rain had settled down into a steady drizzle. Tom ventured out into the cockpit and looked about him. The hills across the river were gray in the mist and the wide expanse of water was steel color. He could see now that there was another road close under the precipitous cliffs and that the one which divided this lowland from the river was almost awash. Through the mist and drizzle along this higher road came a man. He left the road and started to pick his way across the flat, hailing as he came. The three boys awaited him in the cockpit.  \"Don't nobody leave that boat!\" he called, \"or I'll shoot.\"  \"Dearie me,\" said Roy. \"He seems to be peeved. What are we up against, anyway?\"  \"Don't shoot, mister,\" called Tom. \"You couldn't drag us out of here with a team of horses.\"  \"Tell him we are Boy Scouts and fear naught,\" whispered Pee-wee. \"Tell him we scorn his--er--what d'you call it?\"  \"Hey, mister,\" called Roy. \"We are Boy Scouts and fear naught, and we scorn your what-d'you-call it.\"  \"Haouw?\" called the man.  \"What's that he's got on?\" said Tom, \"a merit badge?\"  \"It's a cop's badge,\" whispered Pee-wee. \"Oh, crinkums, we're pinched.\"  The man approached, dripping and breathing heavily, and placed his hands on the combing.  \"Anybody here 'sides you youngsters?\" he demanded, at the same time peering inside the cabin.  \"A few spiders,\" said Tom.  \"Whatcher doin' here, anyway?\"  \"We're waiting for the storm to hold up,\" said Roy; \"we beat it from that road when----\"  \"We sought refuge,\" Pee-wee prompted him.  \"Any port in a storm, you know,\" Roy smiled. \"Are we pinched?\"  The man did not vouchsafe an immediate answer to this vital query. Instead he poked his head in, peered about and then said, \"Don' know's ye are, not fur's I'm concerned. I'd like to hev ye answer me one question honest, though.\"  \"You'll have to answer one for us first,\" called Roy, who had disappeared within the little cabin. \"Do you take two lumps of sugar in your coffee?\"  The man now condescended to smile, as Roy brought out a steaming cup and handed it to him.  \"Wall, ye've got all the comforts uv home, ain't ye?\"  \"Give him a rice cake,\" whispered Pee-wee in Roy's ear. \"He's all right.\"  \"Won't you come in?\" said Roy. \"I don't know whose boat this is, but you're welcome. I guess we didn't do any damage. We chopped up a couple of broken stanchions, that's all.\"  \"I guess we'll let ye off without more'n ten year uv hard labor,\" said the man, sipping his coffee. \"But I'll give ye a tip. Get away from here as soon's ye can,--hear? Old man Stanton owns this boat an' he's a bear. He'd run ye in fer trespass and choppin' up them stanchions quick as a gun. Ye come oft'n that outer road, ye say? Strangers here?\"  \"I can see now that road is flooded,\" said Tom. \"Guess it isn't used, is it?\"  \"This is all river land,\" said the man. \"In extra high tides this here land is flooded an' the only ones usin' that thar road is the fishes. This rain keeps up another couple of days an' we get a full moon on top o' that the old hulk'll float, by gol! Ye didn't see no men around here last night now, did ye?\"  \"Not a soul,\" said Roy.  \"'Cause there was a prisoner escaped up yonder last night an' when I see the smoke comin' out o' yer flue contraption here I thought like enough he hit this shelter.\"  \"Up yonder?\" Tom queried.  \"You're strangers, hey?\" the man repeated.  \"We're on a hike,\" said Tom. \"We're on"]]]
