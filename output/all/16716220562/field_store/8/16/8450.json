He was severely criticized for his statement, and yet it is very true, and for more than a generation it had been taught to American boys and girls. Peace societies had sent lecturers to the public schools to point out the wickedness of war and the blessings of peace.  Prizes had been offered to high school, normal school, and college students for the best essays on _Peace_, _How to Maintain the Peace of the World_, and other similar subjects.  To get ready for war by enlarging the army and navy was declared to be the very best way to bring on war.  School reading books made a feature of peace selections, and school histories were making as little of our national wars as possible.  These teachings and the very air of the land of freedom made people too proud to fight, if there were any honorable way of avoiding it.  It is said that \"People judge others by themselves.\"  So Americans, being peaceful, contented, and not possessed with envy of their neighbors, supposed all other civilized people were like themselves. Therefore they could not at first believe that the Germans were different and looked upon war as a glorious thing, because through it they might get possession of the wealth and property of others. Perhaps the Germans, judging other people by themselves, believed that the French and Russians and English, like the Germans, stood ready to go to war whenever through it they might gain wealth and territory; but the Germans did not think this of the people of the United States. They thought that they were a nation of traders and money-getters in love with the Almighty Dollar.  As events proved, this idea was a fatal mistake on the part of the Germans.  In entirely different ways, both Americans and Germans were taught that they were the people above all other peoples in the world.  The German insolently sang \"Germany above All\" while the American good-naturedly boasted his land as the freest, the noblest and best, leading all the other countries and showing them the way to become greater and better. The American people, however, did not intend to force their beliefs upon other nations.  But the Germans were led by the idea that German Kultur would be a blessing for all mankind and that it was their destiny to conquer and improve all other nations.    Thor stood at the northernmost point of the world.   His hammer flew from his hand.   \"So far as my hammer this arm has hurled,   All mine are the sea and the land.\"   And forward flew the giant tool   Over the whole broad earth, to fall   At last in the southernmost pool   To prove that Thor's was all.   Since then 'tis the pleasant German way   By the hammer, lands to win,   And to claim for themselves world-wide sway,   As the Hammer-god's nearest kin.   But the American does not go this far.  While he is inclined to believe himself and his country better than any other people or nation, yet he is content to let others live in their own way as long as they are honest and do not interfere with him and his business.  He is, to be sure, desirous of improving them, but by peaceful means, by building dams and railroads for them, and by giving them schools and sending them missionaries.  It was difficult therefore for Americans to realize that the Germans really planned and desired the war in order that they might rule the world.  It took months and even years of war for the majority of Americans to come to a full realization of this truth.  This should be remembered when the question is asked, not why the United States entered the war, but why she did not enter it earlier.  Americans are honorable and look upon the breaking of a pledge or an agreement as a shameful thing.  It was almost impossible for them to believe that a nation, far advanced in science and learning of all kinds, could look upon a treaty as a scrap of paper and consider its most solemn promises as not binding when it was to its advantage to break them.  Americans in their homes, their churches, and their schools had been taught that \"an honest man is the noblest work of God.\"  They had heard the old saying that \"All is fair in love and war\"; but they could not think for a moment that a whole nation of men and women had been taught that lies and treachery and broken promises were fair because they helped the Fatherland work out its destiny and rule the world.  They knew that Chancellor Bismarck falsified a telegram to bring on the war with France in 1870, and they learned to their dismay that Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg in 1914 declared the treaty with Belgium only \"a scrap of paper\" when Germany wished to cross that country to strike France.  Americans kept learning that Germany's promises to respect hospitals and hospital ships, stretcher-bearers and the Red Cross, not to interfere with non-combatants, not to use poison gas, not to bombard defenseless cities and towns were all \"scraps of paper.\" They discovered even the naturalization papers which Germans in America took out in order to become American citizens were lies sworn to, for the German who declared his loyalty to his new mother country was still held by Germany as owing his first fealty and duty to her.  It must be said, however, that many Germans who became naturalized in the United States did not agree with these secret orders of their Fatherland; but many others did, and the rulers of Germany encouraged such deception.  It was many months after the beginning of the World War before the large body of American citizens would believe that the German nation and the German people made a business of lies and deception, and considered such a business just and proper when in the service of the Fatherland.  But when Germany--after having promised the United States on May 4, 1916, that merchant ships would not be sunk without warning or without giving the crews and passengers an opportunity for safety--on January 31, 1917, informed Washington that she was not going to keep her promise and told the German people that she had only made it in order to get time to build a great submarine fleet which would bring England to her knees in three months--then the American people saw Germany as she was and in her shame.  Of all the peoples of the earth, the Americans are probably the most sympathetic and helpful to the weak and the afflicted.  They are the most merciful, striving to be kind not only to people but even to animals.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, another for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the numberless Bands of Mercy show the feeling of the people of America toward the helpless.  Americans supposed that other people were like them in this respect.  They knew of the German pensions to the widows and to the aged, and they supposed that the efficient and enlightened Germans were among the merciful and sympathetic to the weak and dependent.  The people of the United States knew, of course, of the Zabern incident where two German soldiers held a crippled Alsatian cobbler while a German officer slashed his face with his sword for laughing at him,--they knew that the German army officers were haughty and overbearing, but they thought this came from their training and was not a part of the German character.  Americans had read the Kaiser's directions to the German soldiers going to China during the Boxer uprising to \"Show no mercy!  Take no prisoners!  Use such frightfulness that a Chinaman will never dare look at a German again.  Make a name for yourselves as the Hun did long ago.\"  But the Americans, or most of them, did not believe that in the twentieth century a nation classified among the civilized nations could or would adopt _Frightfulness_ as a policy.  But when they read of the devastation of Belgium and northern France; of the destruction of Louvain; of whole villages of innocent men, women, and children being wiped out; of the horrible crimes of the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the _Falaba_, and the _Laconia_; of the execution of Edith Cavell; of the carrying off into slavery, or worse than slavery, of the able-bodied women and men from the conquered territory--when Americans learned these horrors one after another, they at last were forced to acknowledge that, like the brutal Assyrian kings who sought to terrify their enemies into submission by standing as conquerors upon pyramids of the slain, the modern Huns sought mastery by _Frightfulness_.  When most Americans came to realize that Germany was fighting a war to conquer the world, first Russia and France, then England, and then the United States--for she had written Mexico that if she would attack the United States, Germany and Mexico would make war and peace together--when they came to know the German nature and the idea of the Germans, that Might makes Right and that truth, honesty, and square dealing like mercy, pity, and love are only words of weaklings; that they were a nation of liars and falsifiers and the most brutal of all people of recorded history; when, added to this, the Americans realized that for over two years France and England had really been fighting for everything for which the United States stood and which her people held dear, for her very life and liberty, then America almost as one man declared for war.  Meanwhile Germany had declined to recognize the laws of nations which allowed America to sell munitions to the Allies.  She had scattered spies through the United States to destroy property and create labor troubles.  She had challenged the right of peaceful Americans to travel on the high seas.  She had sunk the _Lusitania_ with a loss of one hundred twenty-four American lives; the _Sussex_, the _Laconia_ with a loss of eight Americans, the _Vigilancia_ with five, the _City of Memphis_, the _Illinois_, the _Healdton_, and others.  She had tried to unite Mexico and Japan against us.  Not until then, after the American people had become fully aware of the German character and purposes, did Congress on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19906"],["title","Winning a Cause: World War Stories (#2)"],["body","6, 1917, declare a state of war existed between Germany and the United States.  On that day the outcome of the war was decided.  Through her hideous selfishness, her stupidity, and her brutality, Germany, after having spent nearly fifty years in preparation, lost her opportunity for world dominion.  The resources and the fighting power of what she looked upon as a nation of cowardly, money-loving merchants decided the conflict.       AMERICA COMES IN    We are coming from the ranch, from the city and the mine,   And the word has gone before us to the towns upon the Rhine;       As the rising of the tide       On the Old-World side,   We are coming to the battle, to the Line.    From the Valleys of Virginia, from the Rockies in the North,   We are coming by battalions, for the word was carried forth:       \"We have put the pen away       And the sword is out today,   For the Lord has loosed the Vintages of Wrath.\"    We are singing in the ships as they carry us to fight,   As our fathers sang before us by the camp-fires' light;       In the wharf-light glare,       They can hear us Over There   When the ships come steaming through the night.    Right across the deep Atlantic where the Lusitania passed,   With the battle-flag of Yankee-land a-floating at the mast       We are coming all the while,       Over twenty hundred mile,   And we're staying to the finish, to the last.    We are many--we are one--and we're in it overhead,   We are coming as an Army that has seen its women dead,       And the old Rebel Yell       Will be loud above the shell   When we cross the top together, seeing red.

As the months grew to years   Their men and their women had watched     through their blood and their tears   For a sign that we knew, we who could not     have come to be free   Without France, long ago.  And at last     from the threatening sea   The stars of our strength on the eyes     of their weariness rose;   And he stood among them,     the sorrow strong hero we chose   To carry our flag to the tomb     of that Frenchman whose name   A man of our country could once more     pronounce without shame.   What crown of rich words would he set     for all time on this day?   The past and the future were listening     what he would say--   Only this, from the white-flaming heart     of a passion austere,   Only this--ah, but France understood!     \"Lafayette, we are here.\"    AMELIA JOSEPHINE BURR.  [Illustration: \"Lafayette, We Are Here!\"  The immortal tribute of General John J. Pershing at the grave of the great Frenchman.  Notice the difference between the American and French salutes.]     AMERICA ENTERS THE WAR  SPEECH BY LLOYD GEORGE, BRITISH PREMIER,  APRIL 12, 1917  I am in the happy position of being, I think, the first British Minister of the Crown who, speaking on behalf of the people of this country, can salute the American Nation as comrades in arms.  I am glad; I am proud.  I am glad not merely because of the stupendous resources which this great nation will bring to the succor of the alliance, but I rejoice as a democrat that the advent of the United States into this war gives the final stamp and seal to the character of the conflict as a struggle against military autocracy throughout the world.  That was the note that ran through the great deliverance of President Wilson.  The United States of America have the noble tradition, never broken, of having never engaged in war except for liberty.  And this is the greatest struggle for liberty that they have ever embarked upon.  I am not at all surprised, when one recalls the wars of the past, that America took its time to make up its mind about the character of this struggle.  In Europe most of the great wars of the past were waged for dynastic aggrandizement and conquest.  No wonder when this great war started that there were some elements of suspicion still lurking in the minds of the people of the United States of America.  There were those who thought perhaps that kings were at their old tricks--and although they saw the gallant Republic of France fighting, they some of them perhaps regarded it as the poor victim of a conspiracy of monarchical swash-bucklers.  The fact that the United States of America has made up its mind finally makes it abundantly clear to the world that this is no struggle of that character, but a great fight for human liberty.  They naturally did not know at first what we had endured in Europe for years from this military caste in Prussia.  It never has reached the United States of America.  Prussia was not a democracy.  The Kaiser promises that it will be a democracy after the war.  I think he is right.  But Prussia not merely was not a democracy.  Prussia was not a state; Prussia was an army.  It had great industries that had been highly developed; a great educational system; it had its universities; it had developed its science.  All these were subordinate to the one great predominant purpose of all--a conquering army which was to intimidate the world.  The army was the spearpoint of Prussia; the rest was merely the haft.  That was what we had to deal with in these old countries.  It got on the nerves of Europe.  They knew what it all meant.  It was an army that in recent times had waged three wars, all of conquest, and the unceasing tramp of its legions through the streets of Prussia, on the parade grounds of Prussia, had got into the Prussian head.  The Kaiser, when he witnessed on a grand scale his reviews, got drunk with the sound of it.  He delivered the law to the world as if Potsdam was another Sinai, and he was uttering the law from the thunder clouds.  But make no mistake.  Europe was uneasy.  Europe was half intimidated. Europe was anxious.  Europe was apprehensive.  We knew the whole time what it meant.  What we did not know was the moment it would come.  This is the menace, this is the apprehension from which Europe has suffered for over fifty years.  It paralyzed the beneficent activity of all states, which ought to be devoted to concentrating on the well-being of their peoples.  They had to think about this menace, which was there constantly as a cloud ready to burst over the land.  No one can tell except Frenchmen what they endured from this tyranny, patiently, gallantly, with dignity, till the hour of deliverance came. The best energies of military science had been devoted to defending itself against the impending blow.  France was like a nation which put up its right arm to ward off a blow, and could not give the whole of her strength to the great things which she was capable of.  That great, bold, imaginative, fertile mind, which would otherwise have been clearing new paths for progress, was paralyzed.  That is the state of things we had to encounter.  The most characteristic of Prussian institutions is the Hindenburg line.  What is the Hindenburg line?  The Hindenburg line is a line drawn in the territories of other people, with a warning that the inhabitants of those territories shall not cross it at the peril of their lives.  That line has been drawn in Europe for fifty years.  You recollect what happened some years ago in France, when the French Foreign Minister was practically driven out of office by Prussian interference.  Why?  What had he done?  He had done nothing which a minister of an independent state had not the most absolute right to do. He had crossed the imaginary line drawn in French territory by Prussian despotism, and he had to leave.  Europe, after enduring this for generations, made up its mind at last that the Hindenburg line must be drawn along the legitimate frontiers of Germany herself.  There could be no other attitude than that for the emancipation of Europe and the world.  It was hard at first for the people of America quite to appreciate that Germany had not interfered to the same extent with their freedom, if at all.  But at last they endured the same experience as Europe had been subjected to.  Americans were told that they were not to be allowed to cross and recross the Atlantic except at their peril.  American ships were sunk without warning.  American citizens were drowned, hardly with an apology--in fact, as a matter of German right.  At first America could hardly believe it.  They could not think it possible that any sane people should behave in that manner.  And they tolerated it once, and they tolerated it twice, until it became clear that the Germans really meant it.  Then America acted, and acted promptly.  The Hindenburg line was drawn along the shores of America, and the Americans were told they must not cross it.  America said, \"What is this?\"  Germany said, \"This is our line, beyond which you must not go,\" and America said, \"The place for that line is not the Atlantic, but on the Rhine--and we mean to help you roll it up.\"  There are two great facts which clinch the argument that this is a great struggle for freedom.  The first is the fact that America has come in.  She would not have come in otherwise.  When France in the eighteenth century sent her soldiers to America to fight for the freedom and independence of that land, France also was an autocracy in those days.  But Frenchmen in America, once they were there, their aim was freedom, their atmosphere was freedom, their inspiration was freedom.  They acquired a taste for freedom, and they took it home, and France became free.  That is the story of Russia.  Russia engaged in this great war for the freedom of Serbia, of Montenegro, of Bulgaria, and has fought for the freedom of Europe.  They wanted to make their own country free, and they have done it.  The Russian revolution is not merely the outcome of the struggle for freedom.  It is a proof of the character of the struggle for liberty, and if the Russian people realize, as there is every evidence they are doing, that national discipline is not incompatible with"]]]
