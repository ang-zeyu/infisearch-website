He is the likeness of God; and His likeness would be lost if inverted or perverted.  According to the evidence of the so-called physical             12 senses, man is material, fallen, sick, depraved, mortal. Science and spiritual sense contradict this, and they afford the only true evidence of the being of God and man, the         15 material evidence being wholly false.  Jesus said of personal evil, that \"the truth abode not in him,\" because there is no material sense.  Matter, as        18 matter, has neither sensation nor personal intelligence. As a pretension to be Mind, matter is a lie, and \"the father of lies;\" Mind is not in matter, and Spirit cannot       21 originate its opposite, named matter.  According to divine Science, Spirit no more changes its species, by evolving matter from Spirit, than natural           24 science, so-called, or material laws, bring about altera- tion of species by transforming minerals into vegetables or plants into animals, -- thus confusing and confounding       27 the three great kingdoms.  No rock brings forth an apple;       1 no pine-tree produces a mammal or provides breast-milk for babes.                                                      3  To sense, the lion of to-day is the lion of six thousand years ago; but in Science, Spirit sends forth its own harm- less likeness.                                                  6  _How should I undertake to demonstrate Christian Science_ _in healing the sick?_  As I have given you only an epitome of the Principle,           9 so I can give you here nothing but an outline of the prac- tice. Be honest, be true to thyself, and true to others; then it follows thou wilt be strong in God, the eternal         12 good. Heal through Truth and Love; there is no other healer.  In all moral revolutions, from a lower to a higher con-         15 dition of thought and action, Truth is in the minority and error has the majority.  It is not otherwise in the field of Mind-healing.  The man who calls himself a Christian         18 Scientist, yet is false to God and man, is also uttering falsehood about good.  This falsity shuts against him the Truth and the Principle of Science, but opens a way             21 whereby, through will-power, sense may say the unchris- tian practitioner can heal; but Science shows that he makes morally worse the invalid whom he is supposed to cure.          24  By this I mean that mortal mind should not be falsely impregnated.  If by such lower means the health is seem- ingly restored, the restoration is not lasting, and the patient 27 is liable to a relapse, -- \"The last state of that man is       1 worse than the first.\"  The teacher of Mind-healing who is not a Christian,             3 in the highest sense, is constantly sowing the seeds of discord and disease.  Even the truth he speaks is more or less blended with error; and this error will spring up       6 in the mind of his pupil.  The pupil's imperfect knowl- edge will lead to weakness in practice, and he will be a poor practitioner, if not a malpractitioner.                    9  The basis of malpractice is in erring human will, and this will is an outcome of what I call _mortal mind_, -- a false and temporal sense of Truth, Life, and Love.  To          12 heal, in Christian Science, is to base your practice on immortal Mind, the divine Principle of man's being; and this requires a preparation of the heart and an answer          15 of the lips from the Lord.  The Science of healing is the Truth of healing.  If one is untruthful, his mental state weighs against his          18 healing power; and similar effects come from pride, envy, lust, and all fleshly vices.  The spiritual power of a scientific, right thought, with-       21 out a direct effort, an audible or even a mental argument, has oftentimes healed inveterate diseases.  The thoughts of the practitioner should be imbued with          24 a clear conviction of the omnipotence and omnipresence of God; that He is All, and that there can be none beside Him; that God is good, and the producer only of good;           27 and hence, that whatever militates against health, har- mony, or holiness, is an unjust usurper of the throne of        1 the controller of all mankind.  Note this, that if you have power in error, you forfeit the power that Truth bestows,       3 and its salutary influence on yourself and others.  You must feel and know that God alone governs man; that His government is harmonious; that He is too pure          6 to behold iniquity, and divides His power with nothing evil or material; that material laws are only human be- liefs, which govern mortals wrongfully. These beliefs arise     9 from the subjective states of thought, producing the be- liefs of a mortal material universe, -- so-called, and of material disease and mortality.  Mortal ills are but errors     12 of thought, -- diseases of mortal mind, and not of matter; for matter cannot feel, see, or report pain or disease,  Disease is a thing of thought manifested on the body;           15 and fear is the procurator of the thought which causes sickness and suffering. Remove this fear by the true sense that God is Love, -- and that Love punishes nothing       18 but sin, -- and the patient can then look up to the loving God, and know that He afflicteth not willingly the children of men, who are punished because of disobedience to His         21 spiritual law.  His law of Truth, when obeyed, removes every erroneous physical and mental state.  The belief that matter can master Mind, and make you ill, is an            24 error which Truth will destroy.  You must learn to acknowledge God in all His ways. It is only a lack of understanding of the allness of God,       27 which leads you to believe in the existence of matter, or that matter can frame its own conditions, contrary to the       1 law of Spirit.  Sickness is the schoolmaster, leading you to Christ;            3 first to faith in Christ; next to belief in God as omnipo- tent; and finally to the _understanding_ of God and man in Christian Science, whereby you learn that God is good,       6 and in Science man is His likeness, the forever reflection of goodness.  Therefore good is one and All.  This brings forward the next proposition in Christian           9 Science, -- namely, that there are no sickness, sin, and death in the divine Mind.  What seem to be disease, vice, and mortality are illusions of the physical senses.  These      12 illusions are not real, but unreal.  Health is the conscious- ness of the unreality of pain and disease; or, rather, the absolute consciousness of harmony and of nothing else.          15 In a moment you may awake from a night-dream; just so you can awake from the dream of sickness; but the demonstration of the Science of Mind-healing by no means        18 rests on the strength of human belief.  This demonstra- tion is based on a true understanding of God and divine Science, which takes away every human belief, and,              21 through the illumination of spiritual understanding, re- veals the all-power and ever-presence of good, whence emanate health, harmony, and Life eternal.                      24  The lecturer, teacher, or healer who is indeed a Christian Scientist, never introduces the subject of human anatomy; never depicts the muscular, vascular, or nervous opera-         27 tions of the human frame.   He never talks about the structure of the material body. He never lays his hands         1 on the patient, nor manipulates the parts of the body sup- posed to be ailing. Above all, he keeps unbroken the Ten        3 Commandments, and practises Christ's Sermon on the Mount.  Wrong thoughts and methods strengthen the sense of              6 disease, instead of cure it; or else quiet the fear of the sick on false grounds, encouraging them in the belief of error until they hold stronger than before the belief that      9 they are first made sick by matter, and then restored through its agency. This fosters infidelity, and is mental quackery, that denies the Principle of Mind-healing.  If        12 the sick are aided in this mistaken fashion, their ailments will return, and be more stubborn because the relief is unchristian and unscientific.                                   15  Christian Science erases from the minds of invalids their mistaken belief that they live in or because of matter, or that a so-called material organism controls the health       18 or existence of mankind, and induces rest in God, divine Love, as caring for all the conditions requisite for the well- being of man.  As power divine is the healer, why should        21 mortals concern themselves with the chemistry of food? Jesus said: \"Take no thought what ye shall eat.\"  The practitioner should also endeavor to free the minds         24 of the healthy from any sense of subordination to their bodies, and teach them that the divine Mind, not material law, maintains human health and life.                           27  A Christian Scientist knows that, in Science, disease is unreal; that Mind is not in matter; that Life is God,        1 good; hence Life is not functional, and is neither matter nor mortal mind; knows that pantheism and theosophy             3 are not Science.  Whatever saps, with human belief, this basis of Christian Science, renders it impossible to demonstrate the Principle of this Science, even in the          6 smallest degree.  A mortal and material body is not the actual individuality of man made in the divine and spiritual image of God.           9 The material body is not the likeness of Spirit; hence it is not the truth of being, but the likeness of error ? the human belief which saith there is more than one God, --         12 there is more than one Life and one Mind.  In Deuteronomy (iv. 35) we read:  \"The Lord, He is God; there is none else "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19666"],["title","Rudimental Divine Science (#2)"],["body","Him.\"  In John (iv. 24)          15 we may read: \"God is Spirit.\"  These propositions, un- derstood in their Science, elucidate my meaning.  When treating a patient, it is not Science to treat every       18 organ in the body.  To aver that harmony is the real and discord is the unreal, and then give special attention to what according to their own belief is diseased, is scientific;  21 and if the _healer realizes_ the truth, it will free his patient.  _What are the means and, methods of trustworthy Christian_ _Scientists?_                                                   24  These people should not be expected, more than others, to give all their time to Christian Science work, receiving no wages in return, but left to be fed, clothed, and sheltered  27 by charity.  Neither can they serve two masters, giving         1 only a portion of their time to God, and still be Christian Scientists.  They must give Him all their services, and         3 \"owe no man.\"  To do this, they must at present ask a suitable price for their services, and then _conscientiously_ _earn their wages_, strictly practising Divine Science, and     6 healing the sick.  The author never sought charitable support, but gave fully seven-eighths of her time without remuneration, ex-       9 cept the bliss of doing good. The only pay taken for her labors was from classes, and often those were put off for months, in order to do gratuitous work.  She has never          12 taught a Primary class without several, and sometimes seventeen, free students in it; and has endeavored to take the full price of tuition only from those who were able to      15 pay.  The student who pays must of necessity do better than he who does not pay, and yet will expect and require others to pay him.  No discount on tuition was made on          18 higher classes, because their first classes furnished students with the means of paying for their tuition in the higher instruction, and of doing charity work besides.  If the         21 Primary students are still impecunious, it is their own fault, and this ill-success of itself leaves them unprepared to enter higher classes.                                        24  People are being healed by means of my instructions, both in and out of class.  Many students, who have passed through a regular course of instruction from me,         27 have been invalids and were healed in the class; but ex- perience has shown that this defrauds the scholar, though       1 it heals the sick.  It is seldom that a student, if healed hi a class, has left     3 it understanding sufficiently the Science of healing to im- mediately enter upon its practice.  Why?  Because the glad surprise of suddenly regained health is a shock to         6 the mind; and this holds and satisfies the thought with exuberant joy.  This renders the mind less inquisitive, plastic, and tract-     9 able; and deep systematic thinking is impracticable until this impulse subsides.  This was the principal reason for advising diseased             12 people not to enter a class.  Few were taken besides inva- lids for students, until there were enough practitioners to fill in the best possible manner the department of healing.     15 Teaching and healing should have separate departments, and these should be fortified on all sides with suitable and thorough guardianship and grace.                                18  Only a very limited number of students can advanta- geously enter a class, grapple with this subject, and well assimilate what has been taught them.  It is impossible         21 to teach thorough Christian Science to promiscuous and large assemblies, or to persons who cannot be addressed individually, so that the mind of the pupil may be dissected    24 more critically than the body of a subject laid bare for anatomical examination.  Public lectures cannot be such lessons in Christian Science as are required to empty and       27 to fill anew the individual mind.  If publicity and material control are the motives for           1 teaching, then public lectures can take the place of private lessons; but the former can never give a thorough knowledge     3 of Christian Science, and a Christian Scientist will never undertake to fit students for practice by such means. Lec- tures in public are needed, but they must be subordinate        6 to thorough class instruction in any branch of education.  None with an imperfect sense of the spiritual significa- tion of the Bible, and its scientific relation to Mind-         9 healing, should attempt overmuch in their translation of the Scriptures into the \"new tongue;\" but I see that some novices, in the truth of Science, and some impostors are   12 committing this error.  _Is there more than one school of scientific healing?_  In reality there is, and can be, but one school of the          15 Science of Mind-healing.  Any departure from Science is an irreparable loss of Science.  Whatever is said and written correctly on this Science originates from the Princi-   18 ple and practice laid down in Science and Health, a work which I published in 1875.  This was the first book, re- corded in history, which elucidates a pathological Science      21 purely mental.  Minor shades of difference in Mind-healing have origi- nated with certain opposing factions, springing up among        24 unchristian students, who, fusing with a class of aspirants which snatch at whatever is progressive, call it their first- fruits, or else _post mortem_ evidence.                         27  A slight divergence is fatal in Science.  Like certain          1 Jews whom St. Paul had hoped to convert from mere motives of self-aggrandizement to the love of Christ, these     3 so-called schools are clogging the wheels of progress by blinding the people to the true character of Christian Science, -- its moral power, and its divine efficacy to         6 heal.  The true understanding of Christian Science Mind- healing never originated in pride, rivalry, or the deification  9 of self.  The Discoverer of this Science could tell you of timidity, of self-distrust, of friendlessness, toil, agonies, and victories under which she needed miraculous vision to           12 sustain her, when taking the first footsteps in this Science.  The ways of Christianity have not changed.  Meek-               15 ness, selflessness, and love are the paths of His testimony and the footsteps of His flock.
