I wouldn't have thought that a celebrated author of whom nobody had ever heard before would be the center of so much interest in monster-hunting circles. I kept looking at my watch while we were talking. After a while, the Times newscast came on the big screen across the room, and everybody moved over toward it.  They watched the _Peenemünde_ being towed down and berthed, and the audiovisual interview with Murell. Then Dad came on the screen with a record player in front of them, and gave them a play-off of my interview with Leo Belsher.  Ordinary bad language I do not mind. I'm afraid I use a little myself, while struggling with some of the worn-out equipment we have at the paper. But when Belsher began explaining about how the price of wax had to be cut again, to thirty-five centisols a pound, the language those hunters used positively smelled. I noticed, though, that a lot of the crowd weren't saying anything at all. They would be Ravick's boys, and they would have orders not to start anything before the meeting.  \"Wonder if he's going to try to give us that stuff about substitutes?\" Oscar said.  \"Well, what are you going to do?\" I asked.  \"I'll tell you what we're not going to do,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"We're not going to take his price cut. If he won't pay our price, he can use his [deleted by censor] substitutes.\"  \"You can't sell wax anywhere else, can you?\"  \"Is that so, we can't?\" Joe started.  Before he could say anything else, Oscar was interrupting:  \"We can eat for a while, even if we don't sell wax. Sigurd Ngozori'll carry us for a while and make loans on wax. But if the wax stops coming in, Kapstaad Chemical's going to start wondering why....\"  By this time, other _Javelin_ men came drifting over--Ramón Llewellyn, the mate, and Abdullah Monnahan, the engineer, and Abe Clifford, the navigator, and some others. I talked with some of them, and then drifted off in the direction of the bar, where I found another hunter captain, Mohandas Gandhi Feinberg, whom everybody simply called the Mahatma. He didn't resemble his namesake. He had a curly black beard with a twisted black cigar sticking out of it, and nobody, after one look at him, would have mistaken him for any apostle of nonviolence.  He had a proposition he was enlisting support for. He wanted balloting at meetings to be limited to captains of active hunter-ships, the captains to vote according to expressed wishes of a majority of their crews. It was a good scheme, though it would have sounded better if the man who was advocating it hadn't been a captain himself. At least, it would have disenfranchised all Ravick's permanently unemployed \"unemployed hunters.\" The only trouble was, there was no conceivable way of getting it passed. It was too much like trying to curtail the powers of Parliament by act of Parliament.  The gang from the street level started coming up, and scattered in twos and threes around the hall, ready for trouble. I'd put on my radio when I'd joined the Kivelsons and Oscar, and I kept it on, circulating around and letting it listen to the conversations. The Ravick people were either saying nothing or arguing that Belsher was doing the best he could, and if Kapstaad wouldn't pay more than thirty-five centisols, it wasn't his fault. Finally, the call bell for the meeting began clanging, and the crowd began sliding over toward the elevators and escalators.  The meeting room was on the floor above, at the front of the building, beyond a narrow hall and a door at which a couple of Ravick henchmen wearing guns and sergeant-at-arms brassards were making everybody check their knives and pistols. They passed me by without getting my arsenal, which consisted of a sleep-gas projector camouflaged as a jumbo-sized lighter and twenty sols in two rolls of forty quarter sols each. One of these inside a fist can make a big difference.  Ravick and Belsher and the secretary of the Co-op, who was a little scrawny henpecked-husband type who never had an opinion of his own in his life, were all sitting back of a big desk on a dais in front. After as many of the crowd who could had found seats and the rest, including the Press, were standing in the rear, Ravick pounded with the chunk of monster tusk he used for a gavel and called the meeting to order.  \"There's a bunch of old business,\" he said, \"but I'm going to rule that aside for the moment. We have with us this evening our representative on Terra, Mr. Leo Belsher, whom I wish to present. Mr. Belsher.\"  Belsher got up. Ravick started clapping his hands to indicate that applause was in order. A few of his zombies clapped their hands; everybody else was quiet. Belsher held up a hand.  \"Please don't applaud,\" he begged. \"What I have to tell you isn't anything to applaud about.\"  \"You're tootin' well right it isn't!\" somebody directly in front of me said, very distinctly.  \"I'm very sorry to have to bring this news to you, but the fact is that Kapstaad Chemical Products, Ltd., is no longer able to pay forty-five centisols a pound. This price is being scaled down to thirty-five centisols. I want you to understand that Kapstaad Chemical wants to give you every cent they can, but business conditions no longer permit them to pay the old price. Thirty-five is the absolute maximum they can pay and still meet competition--\"  \"Aaah, knock it off, Belsher!\" somebody shouted. \"We heard all that rot on the screen.\"  \"How about our contract?\" somebody else asked. \"We do have a contract with Kapstaad, don't we?\"  \"Well, the contract will have to be re-negotiated. They'll pay thirty-five centisols or they'll pay nothing.\"  \"They can try getting along without wax. Or try buying it somewhere else!\"  \"Yes; those wonderful synthetic substitutes!\"  \"Mr. Chairman,\" Oscar Fujisawa called out. \"I move that this organization reject the price of thirty-five centisols a pound for tallow-wax, as offered by, or through, Leo Belsher at this meeting.\"  Ravick began clamoring that Oscar was out of order, that Leo Belsher had the floor.  \"I second Captain Fujisawa's motion,\" Mohandas Feinberg said.  \"And Leo Belsher doesn't have the floor; he's not a member of the Co-operative,\" Tom Kivelson declared. \"He's our hired employee, and as soon as this present motion is dealt with, I intend moving that we fire him and hire somebody else.\"  \"I move to amend Captain Fujisawa's motion,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"I move that the motion, as amended, read, '--and stipulate a price of seventy-five centisols a pound.'\"  \"You're crazy!\" Belsher almost screamed.  Seventy-five was the old price, from which he and Ravick had been reducing until they'd gotten down to forty-five.  Just at that moment, my radio began making a small fuss. I unhooked the handphone and brought it to my face.  \"Yeah?\"  It was Bish Ware's voice: \"Walt, get hold of the Kivelsons and get them out of Hunters' Hall as fast as you can,\" he said. \"I just got a tip from one of my ... my parishioners. Ravick's going to stage a riot to give Hallstock's cops an excuse to raid the meeting. They want the Kivelsons.\"  \"Roger.\" I hung up, and as I did I could hear Joe Kivelson shouting:  \"You think we don't get any news on this planet? Tallow-wax has been selling for the same price on Terra that it did eight years ago, when you two crooks started cutting the price. Why, the very ship Belsher came here on brought the quotations on the commodity market--\"  I edged through the crowd till I was beside Oscar Fujisawa. I decided the truth would need a little editing; I didn't want to use Bish Ware as my source.  \"Oscar, Dad just called me,\" I told him. \"A tip came in to the Times that Ravick's boys are going to fake a riot and Hallstock's cops are going to raid the meeting. They want Joe and Tom. You know what they'll do if they get hold of them.\"  \"Shot while resisting arrest. You sure this is a good tip, though?\"  Across the room, somebody jumped to his feet, kicking over a chair.  \"That's a double two-em-dashed lie, you etaoin shrdlu so-and-so!\" somebody yelled.  \"Who are you calling a so-and-so, you thus-and-so-ing such-and-such?\" somebody else yelled back, and a couple more chairs got smashed and a swirl of fighting started.  \"Yes, it is,\" Oscar decided. \"Let's go.\"  We started plowing through the crowd toward where the Kivelsons and a couple more of the _Javelin_ crew were clumped. I got one of the rolls of quarter sols into my right fist and let Oscar go ahead. He has more mass than I have.  It was a good thing I did, because before we had gone ten feet, some character got between us, dragged a two-foot length of inch-and-a-half high-pressure hose out of his pant leg, and started to swing at the back of Oscar's head. I promptly clipped him behind the ear with a fist full of money, and down he went. Oscar, who must have eyes in the back of his head, turned and grabbed the hose out of his hand before he dropped it, using it to clout somebody in front of him. Somebody else came pushing toward us, and I was about to clip him, too, when he yelled, \"Watch it, Walt; I'm with it!\" It was Cesário Vieira, another _Javelin_ man; he's engaged to Linda Kivelson, Joe's daughter and Tom's sister, the one going to school on Terra.  Then we had reached Tom and Joe Kivelson. Oscar grabbed Joe by the arm.  \"Come on, Joe; let's get moving,\" he said. \"Hallstock's Gestapo are on the way. They have orders to get you dead or alive.\"  \"Like blazes!\" Joe told him. \"I never chickened out on a fight yet, and--\"  That's what I'd been afraid of. Joe is like a Zarathustra veldtbeest; the only tactics he knows is a headlong attack.  \"You want to get your crew and your son killed, and yourself along with them?\" Oscar asked him. \"That's what'll happen if the cops catch you. Now are you coming, or will I have to knock you senseless and drag you out?\"  Fortunately, at that moment somebody took a swing at Joe and grazed his cheek. It was a good thing that was all he did; he was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],["title","Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: HEREFORD FROM THE WYE.]                            HEREFORD FROM THE WYE.  _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      The Cathedral Church Of Hereford  A Description Of Its Fabric And A Brief History Of The Episcopal See By A. Hugh Fisher  London George Bell and Sons  1898      GENERAL PREFACE.   This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide-books at a popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of Archæology and History, and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.  To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful are:—(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2) the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archæological Societies; (3) the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the English Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to the Cathedrals, originated by the late Mr. John Murray; to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees.

The early history of Hereford, like that of the majority of cathedral churches, is veiled in the obscurity of doubtful speculation and shadowy tradition. Although the see had existed from the sixth century, it is not till much later that we have any information concerning the cathedral itself.  From 755 to 794 there reigned in Mercia one of the most powerful and important rulers of those times,—King Offa. He was a contemporary of Charles the Great, and more than once these two sovereigns exchanged gifts and letters. Under Offa Mercia became the first power in Britain, and in addition to much fighting with the West Saxons and the Kentish men he wrested a large piece of the country lying west of the Severn from the Welsh, took the chief town of the district which was afterwards called Shrewsbury, and like another Severus made a great dyke from the mouth of the Wye to that of the Dee which became henceforth the boundary between Wales and England, a position it has held with few changes to the present day. In church history Offa is of no less importance than in secular, for as the most powerful King in England he seems to have determined that ecclesiastical affairs in this country should be more under his control, or at least supervision, than they could possibly be with the Mercian church subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 786, therefore, he persuaded the Pope to create the Archbishopric of Lichfield. Although Canterbury regained its supremacy upon Offa’s death when Lichfield was shorn by a new Pope of its recently acquired honours, the position gained for the latter see by Offa, though temporary in itself, must have had lasting and important influence. Offa is generally held responsible for the murder, about 793, of Æthelberht, King of the East Angles, who had been promised his daughter, Æthelthryth, in marriage.  Had Æthelberht been gifted with a knowledge of future events (which would not have been a more wonderful attribute than many of the virtues which were ascribed afterwards to his dead body), he could hardly have desired a more glorious fate. His murder gained for him martyrdom with its immortal glory, and he could scarce have met his death under happier auspices. Visiting a king’s residence to fetch his bride he died by the order of a man whose memory is sullied by no other stain, a man renowned in war, a maker of laws for the good of his people, and eminent in an ignorant age as one who encouraged learning.  Legend and tradition have so obscured this event that beyond the bare fact of the murder nothing can be positively asserted, and the brief statement of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, \"792. This year Offa, King of the Mercians, commanded the head of King Æthelberht to be struck off,\" contains all that we may be certain of.  One writer speaks of a hired assassin, and others lay the crime at the door of Cynethryth, Offa’s Queen, who is said to have insinuated that the marriage was only sought as a pretext to occupy the Mercian throne. Finding her lord’s courage not equal to the occasion, she herself arranged the end of Æthelberht. There is talk of a pit dug in his sleeping-chamber and a chair arranged thereover, which, with an appearance of luxurious comfort, lured him to his fate. The body was, according to one writer, privately buried on the bank of the river \"Lugg,\" near Hereford.  \"On the night of his burial,\" says the Monkish Annalist, \"a column of light, brighter than the sun, arose towards heaven\"; and three nights afterwards the figure (or ghost) of King Æthelberht appeared to Brithfrid, a nobleman, and commanded him to convey the body to a place called \"Stratus Waye,\" and to inter it near the monastery there. Guided by another column of light, Brithfrid, having placed the body and the head on a carriage, proceeded on his journey. The head fell from the vehicle, but having been discovered by a \"blind man,\" to whom it miraculously communicated sight, was restored by him to the careless driver. Arrived at his place of destination, then called \"Fernlega\" or \"Saltus Silicis,\" and which has since been termed Hereford, he there interred the body. Whatever the motive for the crime, there is ample evidence of Offa’s subsequent remorse.  In atonement he built monasteries and churches, and is even said by some to have gone on a pilgrimage to Rome, though this rests on slight evidence.  The miracles worked at the tomb of the murdered King were, according to Asser, so numerous and incredible that Offa, who had appropriated Æthelberht’s kingdom, was induced to send two bishops to Hereford to ascertain the truth of them, and it is generally agreed that about A.D. 825 Milfrid, who was Viceroy to the Mercian King Egbert after the death of Offa and of his son Egfrid, expended a large sum of money in building \"_Ecclesiam egregiam, lapidea structura_\" at Hereford, which he consecrated to the martyred monarch, and endowed with lands and enriched with ornaments.  Although one of the old chroniclers calls it a church of stone, it is quite uncertain what were the materials, size, or architectural character of this edifice. It seems, however, that by 1012, when Bishop Athelstan was promoted to the see, it had fallen into sheer ruin, or, at any rate, sufficient decay to necessitate his beginning a new building. Of this no clearer account has been handed down to us than of Milfrid’s church. Soon after it was finished Algar or Elfgar, Earl of Chester, son of the Earl of Mercia, was charged with treason at a Witan in London, and (though his guilt is still disputed) was outlawed by Edward the Confessor. He hired a"]]]
