Aw happen could get on misen,    For aw con work a bit, But little sissy, sir, yo see,    Shoo's varry young as yet.  Oh! dunnot let fowk tak mi mam!    Help me to rouse her up! An if shoo wants her physic,    See,--it's in this little cup.  Aw know her heead wor bad last neet,    When putting us to bed; Shoo said, 'God bless yo, little things!'    An that wor all shoo sed.  Aw saw a tear wor in her e'e--    In fact, it's seldom dry: Sin daddy went shoo allus cries,    But nivver tells us why.  Aw think it's coss he isn't here,    'At maks her e'en soa dim; Shoo says, he'll nivver come to us,    But we may goa to him.  But if shoo's gooan an left us here,    What mun we do or say?-- We connot follow her unless,    Somebody 'll show us th' way.\"              ----  My heart was full to bursting,    When I heard the woeful tale; I gazed a moment on the face    Which death had left so pale;  Then clasping to my heaving breast    The little orphan pair, I sank upon my bended knees,    And offered up a prayer,  That God would give me power to aid    Those children in distress, That I might as a father be    Unto the fatherless.  Then coaxingly I led them forth;    And as the road was long, I bore them in my arms by turns--    Their tears had made me strong.  I took them to my humble home,    Where now they may be seen, The lad,--a noble-minded youth,--    His \"sissy,\"--beauty's queen.  And now if you should chance to see,    Far from the bustling throng, An old man, whom a youth and maid    Lead tenderly along;--  And if you, wondering, long to know    The history of the three,-- They are the little orphan pair--    The poor old man is me:  And oft upon the grassy mound    'Neath which their parents sleep, They bend the knee, and pray for me;    I pray for them and weep.    Did yo Ivver!   \"Gooid gracious!\" cried Susy, one fine summer's morn,    \"Here's a bonny to do! aw declare! Aw wor nivver soa capt sin th' day aw wor born!    Aw neer saw sich a seet at a fair.

But its rayther to bad, just to mak her hooam thear;    For mi old en's net fit to be seen in; An this new en, awm thinkin, 'll luk rayther queer    After sich a rum lot as that's been in.  But shut up awr pussy, an heed what aw say;    Yo mun keep a sharp eye or shoo'll chait us; Ah if shoo sees th' mother shoo'll kill it! An pray    What mun become o' these poor helpless crayturs?  A'a dear! fowk have mich to be thankful for, yet,    'At's a roof o' ther own to cawer under, For if we'd to seek ony nook we could get,    Whativver'd come on us aw wonder?

That poor little maase aw dooant think meant me harm,    Shoo ne'er knew what that bonnet had cost me; All shoo wanted wor some little nook snug an warm    An a gooid two-o'-three shillin its lost me.

Let others boast ther bit o' brass,    That's moor nor aw can do; Aw'm nobbut one o'th' workin class,    'At's strugglin to pool throo; An if it's little 'at aw get,    It's little 'at aw need; An if sometimes aw'm pinched a bit,    Aw try to nivver heed.  Some fowk they tawk o' brokken hearts,    An mourn ther sorry fate, Becoss they can't keep sarvent men,    An dine off silver plate; Aw think they'd show more gradely wit    To listen to my creed, An things they find they connot get,    Why, try to nivver heed.  Ther's some 'at lang for parks an halls,    An letters to ther name; But happiness despises walls,    It's nooan a child o' fame.

Aw remember th' furst day aw went cooartin a bit,-- An walked aght thi gronny;--aw'st nivver forget; For we blushed wol us faces wor all in a blaze;-- It wor noa sin to blush i' thi gronfayther's days,  Ther's noa lasses nah, John, 'at's fit to be wed; They've false teeth i' ther maath, an false hair o' ther heead; They're a mak-up o' buckram, an waddin, an stays,-- But a lass wor a lass i' thi gronfayther's days.  At that time a tradesman dealt fairly wi' th' poor, But nah a fair dealer can't keep oppen th' door; He's a fooil if he fails, he's a scamp if he pays; Ther wor honest men lived i' thi gronfayther's days.  Ther's chimleys an factrys i' ivvery nook nah, But ther's varry few left 'at con fodder a caah; An ther's telegraff poles all o'th' edge o'th' highways, Whear grew bonny green trees i' thi gronfayther's days.  We're tell'd to be thankful for blessin's 'at's sent, An aw hooap 'at tha'll alius be blessed wi' content; Tha mun mak th' best tha con o' this world wol tha stays, But aw wish tha'd been born i' thi gronfayther's days.

'Twor hard scrattin to get what wor needed,    But we managed someha, to pool throo'; An what we wor short we ne'er heeded,    For that child fun us plenty to do. But we'd health, an we loved one another,    Soa things breetened up after a while; An nah, that young lad an his mother,    Cheer mi on wi' ther prattle an smile.  Them at th' Hall, may mak feeastin an bluster,    An ther table may grooan wi' its looad; But ther's one thing aw know they can't muster,--    That's a lad hawf as grand as awr Dooad. For his face is like lillies an rooases,    An his limbs sich as seldom are seen; An just like his father's his nooas is,    An he's getten his mother's blue een.  Soa th' lord an his lady are welcome,    To mak all they like o' ther brat; They may hap him i' silk an i' velvet,--    He's net a bit better for that.

Whear Natur Missed it.   As Rueben wor smookin his pipe tother neet,    Bi th' corner o'th' little \"Slip Inn;\" He spied some fowk marchin, an fancied he heeard    A varry queer sooart ov a din. As nearer they coom he sed, \"Bless mi life!    What means all this hullaballoo? If they dooant stop that din they'll sewer get run in,    An just sarve 'em reight if they do.\"  But as they approached, he saw wi' surprise,    They seemed a respectable lot; An th' hymn at they sung he'd net heeard for soa long,    Wol he felt fairly rooited to th' spot. I'th' front wor a woman who walked backards rooad,    Beatin time wi' a big umberel, An he sed, \"Well, aw'll bet, that licks all aw've seen yet,    What they'll do next noa mortal can tell.\"  On they coom like a flood, an shoo saw Rueben stood,--    An her een seemed fair blazin wi' leet; \"Halt!\" shoo cried, an shoo went an varry sooin sent    Rueben's pipe flyin off into th' street. \"Young man,\" shoo began, \"if yo had been born    To smoke that old pipe, then insteead, Ov a nice crop o' hair Natur wod a put thear    A chimly at top o' thi heead.\"  Rueben felt rather mad, for 'twor all th' pipe he had,    An he sed, \"Well, that happen mud be; But aw'm nobbut human, an thee bein a woman    Has proved a salvation to thee. If a chap had done that aw'd ha knocked him daan flat,    But wi' yo its a different thing; But aw'm thinkin someha, th' same law will allaa    Me too smook, at allaas yo to sing.\"  Shoo gloored in his face an went back to her place,    As shoo gave him a witherin luk; An swung her umbrel,--ovverbalanced, an fell    An ligg'd sprawlin her length amang th' muck. All her army seemed dumb, an th' chap wi' th' big drum,    Turned a bulnex, an let on her chest; Wol th' fiddles an flute wor ivvery one mute,    An th' tamborines tuk a short rest.  Then Rueben drew near, an he sed in her ear,    As he lifted her onto her feet; \"Sometimes its as wise when we start to advise,    To be mindful we're net indiscreet. If yo'd been intended to walk backardsway,    To save yo from gettin that bump, Dame Natur, in kindness, aw'll ventur to say,    Wod ha planted a e'e i' yor bustle.\"    That's All.   Mi hair is besprinkled wi' gray,    An mi face has grown wrinkled an wan;-- They say ivvery dog has his day,    An noa daat its th' same way wi a man. Aw know at mi day is nah passed,    An life's twileet is all at remains; An neet's drawin near varry fast,--    An will end all mi troubles an pains.  Aw can see misen, nah, as a lad,    Full ov mischief an frolic an fun;-- An aw see what fine chonces aw had,    An regret lots o' things at aw've done. Thowtless deeds--unkind words--selfish gains,--    Time wasted, an more things beside, But th' saddest thowt ivver remains,--    What aw could ha done, if aw'd but tried.  Aw've had a fair share ov life's joys,    An aw've nivver known th' want ov a meal; Aw've ne'er laiked wi' luxuries' toys,    Nor suffered what starvin fowk feel. But aw'm moor discontented to-day,    When mi memory carries me back, To know what aw've gethered is clay,    Wol diamonds wor strewed on mi track.  Aw can't begin ovver agean,    (Maybe its as weel as it is,) Soa aw'm waitin for th' life 'at's to be,    For ther's nowt to be praad on i' this.

When aw cooarted Mary Hanner,    Aw wor young an varry shy; An shoo used to play th' peanner    Wol aw sheepishly sat by. Aw lang'd to tell her summat,    But aw railly hadn't th' pluck, Tho' monny a time aw started,    Yet, somha aw allus stuck.  Aw'm sewer shoo must ha guess'd it,    But shoo nivver gave a sign; Shoo drummed at that peanner;--    A'a! aw wish it had been mine! Aw'd ha chopt it into matchwood,--    Aw'd ha punced it into th' street, It wor awful aggravatin,    For shoo thumpt it ivvery neet.  Aw'd getten ommost sickened,    When one day another chap Aw saw thear, an he'd getten    Mary Hanner on his lap. Aw didn't stop to argyfy,--    But fell'd him like an ox; An Mary Hanner tried to fly    On top o'th' music box.  But he wor gam,--an sich a job    Aw'd nivver had befor, We fowt, but aw proved maister,    An aw punced him aght o'th' door. Then like a Tigercat, at me    Flew ragin Mary Hammer;-- Yo bet! shoo could thump summat else,    Besides her loud peanner!  Aw had to stand an tak her blows,    Until shoo'd geeten winded; \"Tha scamp!\" shoo says, \"tha little knows    What bargainin tha's hindered! Awr Jack had nobbut coom to pay,    Becoss he's bowt th' peanner, An nah tha's driven him away!\"    \"Forgie me, Mary Hanner.\"  Aw ran aghtside an sooin fan Jack,    An humbly begged his parden;-- \"All reight,\"--he sed, \"aw'm commin back,\"    He didn't care a farden. He paid her th' brass, then fetched a cart,    An hauled away th' peanner;-- We're wed sin then, an nowt shall part,    Me an mi Mary Hanner.    Grondad's Lullaby.   Sleep bonny babby, thi grondad is near,    Noa harm can touch thee, sleep withaat fear; Innocent craytur, soa helpless an waik,    Grondad wod give up his life for thy sake,          Sleep little beauty,          Angels thee keep,          Grondad is watchin,          Sleep, beauty, sleep.  Through the thick mist of past years aw luk back, Vainly aw try to discover the track Buried, alas! for no trace can aw see, Ov the way aw once trod when as sinless as thee,          Sleep little beauty,          Angels thee keep,          Grondad is watchin,          Sleep, beauty, sleep.  Smilin in slumber,--dreamin ov bliss, Feelin in fancy a fond mother's kiss; Richer bi far nor a king on his throne, Fearlessly facing a future unknown.          Sleep little beauty,          Angels thee keep,          Grondad is watchin,          Sleep, beauty, sleep.  What wod aw give could aw once agean be, Innocent, spotless an trustin as thee; May noa grief give thee occasion to weep, Blessins attend thee!--Sleep, beauty, sleep.

Aw'm turned o' sixty, nah, old lass,    Yet weel aw mind the time, When like a young horse turned to grass,    Aw gloried i' mi prime. Aw'st ne'er forget that bonny face    'At stole mi heart away; Tho' years have hurried on apace:--    Aw'm sixty, turned, to-day.  We had some jolly pranks an gams,    E'en fifty year ago, When sportive as a pair o' lambs,    We nivver dreeamed ov woe. When ivvery morn we left us bed,    Wi' spirits leet an gay,-- But nah, old lass, those days have fled:--    Aw'm sixty, turned, to-day.  Yet we've noa reason to repine,    Or luk back wi' regret; Those youthful days ov thine an mine,    Live sweet in mem'ry yet. Thy winnin smile aw still can see,    An tho' thi hair's turned grey; Tha'rt still as sweet an dear to me,    Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.  We've troubles had, an sickness too,    But then in spite ov all, We've somha managed to pool throo,    Whativver might befall. Awr pleasurs far outweighed the pain    We've met along life's way; An losses past aw caant as gain,--    When sixty, turned, to-day.  Awr childer nah are wed an gooan,    To mak hooams for thersels; But we shall nivver feel alooan,    Wol love within us dwells. We're drawin near awr journey's end,    We can't much longer stay; Yet still awr hearts together blend,    Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.  Then let us humbly bow the knee,    To Him, whose wondrous love, Has helpt an guided thee an me,    On th' pathway to above. His mercies we will ne'er forget,    Then let us praise an pray, To Him whose wings protect us yet;    Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.    That Lad Next Door.   Aw've nowt agean mi naybors,    An aw wod'nt have it sed 'At aw wor cross an twazzy,    For aw'm kind an mild asteead. But ther's an end to patience,    E'en Job knew that aw'm sewer;-- An he nivver had noa dealins    Wi' that lad 'at lives next door.  It wod'nt do to tell 'em    What aw think abaat that lad, One thing aw'm sarten sewer on,    Is, he's ivverything 'at's bad. He's nivver aght o' mischief,    An he nivver stops his din,-- He's noa sooiner aght o' one scrape,    Nor he's another in.  If he wor mine aw'd thresh him,    Wol th' skin coom off his back; Aw'd cure him teein door-snecks,    Then givin th' door a whack. Aw'd leearn him to draw th' shape o' me    Wi' chalk on th' nessy door, An mak mud pies o' awr front steps    An leeav 'em thear bi th' scooar.  He's been a trifle quieter    For this last day or two; He's up to some new devilment,--    Aw dooant know what he'll do.
