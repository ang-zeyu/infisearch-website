He got tired of gazing and wondering, and even began to smile with contempt at the silly fops as they sauntered along, and the gayly dressed ladies, that flaunted like so many idle butterflies, on the sidewalk. It was an exciting scene; but it did not look real to him. It was more like Herr Grunderslung's exhibition of the magic lantern, than anything substantial. The men and women were like so many puppets. They did not seem to be doing anything, or to be walking for any purpose.  He got out of the butcher's cart at the Old South. His first impression, as he joined the busy throng, was, that he was one of the puppets. He did not seem to have any hold upon the scene, and for several minutes this sensation of vacancy chained him to the spot.  \"All right!\" exclaimed he to himself at last. \"I am here. Now's my time to make a strike. Now or never.\"  He pulled Mr. Bayard's card from his pocket, and fixed the number of his store in his mind. Now, numbers were not a Riverdale institution, and Bobby was a little perplexed about finding the one indicated. A little study into the matter, however, set him right, and he soon had the satisfaction of seeing the bookseller's name over his store.  \"F. Bayard,\" he read; \"this is the place.\"  \"Country!\" shouted a little ragged boy, who dodged across the street at that moment.  \"Just so, my beauty!\" said Bobby, a little nettled at this imputation of verdancy.  \"What a greeny!\" shouted the little vagabond from the other side of the street.  \"No matter, rag-tag! We'll settle that matter some other time.\"  But Bobby felt that there was something in his appearance which subjected him to the remarks of others, and as he entered the shop, he determined to correct it as soon as possible.  A spruce young gentleman was behind the counter, who cast a mischievous glance at him as he entered.  \"Mr. Bayard keep here?\" asked Bobby.  \"Well, I reckon he does. How are all the folks up country?\" replied the spruce clerk, with a rude grin.  \"How are they?\" repeated Bobby, the color flying to his cheek.  \"Yes, ha-ow do they dew?\"  \"They behave themselves better than they do here.\"  \"Eh, greeny?\"  \"Eh, sappy?\" repeated Bobby, mimicking the soft, silky tones of the young city gentleman.  \"What do you mean by sappy?\" asked the clerk indignantly.  \"What do you mean by greeny?\"  \"I'll let you know what I mean!\"  \"When you do, I'll let you know what I mean by sappy.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed one of the salesmen, who had heard part of this spirited conversation. \"You will learn better by and by, Timmins, than to impose upon boys from out of town.\"  \"You seem to be a gentleman, sir,\" said Bobby, approaching the salesman. \"I wish to see Mr. Bayard.\"  \"You can't see him!\" growled Timmins.  \"Can't I?\"  \"Not at this minute; he is engaged just now,\" added the salesman, who seemed to have a profound respect for Bobby's discrimination. \"He will be at liberty in a few moments.\"  \"I will wait, then,\" said Bobby, seating himself on a stool by the counter.  Pretty soon the civil gentleman left the store to go to dinner, and Timmins, a little timid about provoking the young lion, cast an occasional glance of hatred at him. He had evidently found that \"Country\" was an embryo American citizen, and that he was a firm believer in the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.  Bobby bore no ill will towards the spruce clerk, ready as he had been to defend his \"certain inalienable rights.\"  \"You do a big business here,\" suggested Bobby, in a conciliatory tone, and with a smile on his face which ought to have convinced the uncourteous clerk that he meant well.  \"Who told you so?\" replied Timmins, gruffly.  \"I merely judged from appearances. You have a big store, and an immense quantity of books.\"  \"Appearances are deceitful,\" replied Timmins; and perhaps he had been impressed by the fact from his experience with the lad from the country.  \"That is true,\" added Bobby, with a good-natured smile, which, when interpreted, might have meant, \"I took you for a civil fellow, but I have been very much mistaken.\"  \"You will find it out before you are many days older.\"  \"The book business is good just now, isn't it?\" continued Bobby, without clearly comprehending the meaning of the other's last remark.  \"Humph! What's that to you?\"  \"O, I intend to go into it myself.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha! Good! You do?\"  \"I do,\" replied Bobby, seemingly unconcerned at the taunts of the clerk.  \"I suppose you want to get a place here,\" sneered Timmins, alarmed at the prospect. \"But let me tell you, you can't do it. Bayard has all the help he wants; and if that is what you come for, you can move on as fast as you please.\"  \"I guess I will see him,\" added Bobby, quietly.  \"No use.\"  \"No harm in seeing him.\"  As he spoke he took up a book that lay on the counter, and began to turn over the leaves.  \"Put that book down!\" said the amiable Mr. Timmins.  \"I won't hurt it,\" replied Bobby, who had just fixed his eye upon some very pretty engravings in the volume.  \"Put it down!\" repeated Mr. Timmins, in a loud, imperative tone.  \"Certainly I will, if you say so,\" said Bobby, who, though not much intimidated by the harsh tones of the clerk, did not know the rules of the store, and deemed it prudent not to meddle.  \"I _do_ say so!\" added Mr. Timmins, magnificently; \"and what's more, you'd better mind me, too.\"  Bobby had minded, and probably the stately little clerk would not have been so bold if he had not. Some people like to threaten after the danger is over.  Then our visitor from the country espied some little blank books lying on the counter. He had already made up his mind to have one, in which to keep his accounts; and he thought, while he was waiting, that he would purchase one. He meant to do things methodically; so when he picked up one of the blank books, it was with the intention of buying it.  \"Put that book down!\" said Mr. Timmins, encouraged in his aggressive intentions by the previous docility of our hero.  \"I want to buy one.\"  \"No, you don't; put it down.\"  \"What is the price of these?\" asked Bobby, resolutely.  \"None of your business!\"  \"Is that the way you treat your customers?\" asked Bobby, with a little sternness in his looks and tones. \"I say I want to buy one.\"  \"Put it down.\"  \"But I will not; I say I want to buy it.\"  \"No, you don't!\"  \"What is the price of it?\"  \"Twenty-five cents,\" growled Timmins, which was just four times the retail price.  \"Twenty-five cents! That's high.\"  \"Put it down, then.\"  \"Is that your lowest price?\" asked Bobby, who was as cool as a cucumber.  \"Yes, it is; and if you don't put it down, I'll kick you out of the store.\"  \"Will you? Then I won't put it down.\"  Mr. Timmins took this as a \"stump;\" his ire was up, and he walked round from behind the counter to execute his threat.  I must say I think Bobby was a little forward, and I would have my young readers a little more pliant with small men like Timmins. There are always men enough in the world who are ready and willing to quarrel on any provocation; and it is always best not to provoke them, even if they are overbearing and insolent, as Mr. Timmins certainly was.  \"Hold on a minute before you do it,\" said Bobby, with the same provoking coolness. \"I want to buy this book, and I am willing to pay a fair price for it. But I happen to know that you can buy them up in Riverdale, where I came from, for six cents.\"  \"No matter,\" exclaimed the indignant clerk, seizing Bobby by the coat collar for the purpose of ejecting him; \"you shall find your way into the street.\"  Now Bobby, as I have before intimated, was an embryo American citizen, and the act of Mr. Timmins seemed like an invasion of his inalienable rights. No time was given him to make a formal declaration of rights in the premises; so the instinct of self-preservation was allowed to have free course.  Mr. Timmins pulled and tugged at his coat collar, and Bobby hung back like a mule; and for an instant there was quite a spirited scene.  \"Hallo! Timmins, what does this mean?\" said a voice, at which the valiant little clerk instantly let go his hold.     CHAPTER VIII  IN WHICH MR. TIMMINS IS ASTONISHED, AND BOBBY DINES IN CHESTNUT STREET   It was Mr. Bayard. He had finished his business with the gentleman by his side, and hearing the noise of the scuffle, had come to learn the occasion of it.  \"This impudent young puppy wouldn't let the books alone!\" began Mr. Timmins. \"I threatened to turn him out if he didn't; and I meant to make good my threat. I think he meant to steal something.\"  Bobby was astonished and shocked at this bold imputation; but he wished to have his case judged on its own merits; so he turned his face away, that Mr. Bayard might not recognize him.  \"I wanted to buy one of these blank books,\" added Bobby, picking up the one he had dropped on the floor in the struggle.  \"All stuff!\" ejaculated Timmins. \"He is an impudent, obstinate puppy! In my opinion he meant to steal that book.\"  \"I asked him the price, and told him I wanted to buy it,\" added Bobby, still averting his face.  \"Well, I told him; and he said it was too high.\"  \"He asked me twenty-five cents for it.\"  \"Is this true, Timmins?\" asked Mr. Bayard, sternly.  \"No, _sir_! I told him fourpence,\" replied Timmins, boldly.  \"By gracious! What a whopper!\" exclaimed Bobby, startled out of his propriety by this monstrous lie. \"He said twenty-five cents; and I told him I could buy one up in Riverdale, where I came from, for six cents. Can you deny that?\"  \"It's a lie!\" protested Timmins.  \"Riverdale,\" said Mr. Bayard. \"Are you from Riverdale, boy?\"  \"Yes, sir, I am; and if you will look on your memorandum book you will find my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19473"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright (#8)"],["body"," there.\"  \"Bless me! I am sure I have seen that face before,\" exclaimed Mr. Bayard, as he grasped the hand of Bobby, much to the astonishment and consternation of Mr. Timmins. \"You are----\"  \"Robert Bright, sir.\"  \"My brave little fellow! I am heartily glad to see you;\" and the bookseller shook the hand he held with hearty good will. \"I was thinking of you only a little while ago.\"  \"This fellow calls me a liar,\" said Bobby, pointing to the astonished Mr. Timmins, who did not know what to make of the cordial reception which \"Country\" was receiving from his employer.  \"Well, Robert, we know that _he_ is a liar; this is not the first time he has been caught in a lie. Timmins, your time is out.\"  The spruce clerk hung his head with shame and mortification.  \"I hope, sir, you will----\" he began, but pride or fear stopped him short.  \"Don't be hard with him, sir, if you please,\" said Bobby. \"I suppose I aggravated him.\"  Mr. Bayard looked at the gentleman who stood by his side, and a smile of approbation lighted up his face.  \"Generous as he is noble! Butler, this is the boy that saved Ellen.\"  \"Indeed! He is a little giant!\" replied Mr. Butler, grasping Bobby's hand.  Even Timmins glanced with something like admiration in his looks at the youth whom he had so lately despised. Perhaps, too, he thought of that Scripture wisdom about entertaining angels unawares. He was very much abashed, and nothing but his silly pride prevented him from acknowledging his error and begging Bobby's forgiveness.  \"I can't have a liar about me,\" said Mr. Bayard.  \"There may be some mistake,\" suggested Mr. Butler.  \"I think not. Robert Bright couldn't lie. So brave and noble a boy is incapable of a falsehood. Besides, I got a letter from my friend Squire Lee by this morning's mail, in which he informed me of my young friend's coming.\"  Mr. Bayard took from his pocket a bundle of letters, and selected the squire's from among them. Opening it, he read a passage which had a direct bearing upon the case before him.  \"'I do not know what Bobby's faults are,'\"--the letter said,--\"'but this I do know: that Bobby would rather be whipped than tell a lie. He is noted through the place for his love of truth.'--That is pretty strong testimony; and you see, Bobby,--that's what the squire calls you,--your reputation has preceded you.\"  Bobby blushed, as he always did when he was praised, and Mr. Timmins was more abashed than ever.  \"Did you hear that, Timmins? Who is the liar now?\" said Mr. Bayard, turning to the culprit.  \"Forgive me, sir, this time. If you turn me off now, I cannot get another place, and my mother depends upon my wages.\"  \"You ought to have thought of this before.\"  \"He aggravated me, sir, so that I wanted to pay him off.\"  \"As to that, he commenced upon me the moment I came into the store. But don't turn him off, if you please, sir,\" said Bobby, who even now wished no harm to his discomfited assailant. \"He will do better hereafter: won't you, Timmins?\"  Thus appealed to, Timmins, though he did not relish so direct an inquiry, and from such a source, was compelled to reply in the affirmative; and Mr. Bayard graciously remitted the sentence he had passed against the offending clerk.  \"Now, Robert, you will come over to my house and dine with me. Ellen will be delighted to see you.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Bobby, bashfully, \"I have been to dinner\"--referring to the luncheon he had eaten at Brighton.  \"But you must go to the house with me.\"  \"I should be very glad to do so, sir, but I came on business. I will stay here with Mr. Timmins till you come back.\"  The truth is, he had heard something about the fine houses of the city, and how stylish the people were, and he had some misgivings about venturing into such a strange and untried scene as the parlor of a Boston merchant.  \"Indeed, you must come with me. Ellen would never forgive you or me, if you did not come.\"  \"I would rather rest here till you return,\" replied Bobby, still willing to escape the fine house and the fine folks. \"I walked from Riverdale, sir, and I am rather tired.\"  \"Walked!\" exclaimed Mr. Bayard. \"Had you no money?\"  \"Yes, sir, enough to pay my passage; but Dr. Franklin says that 'a penny saved is a penny earned,' and I thought I would try it. I shall get rested by the time you return.\"  \"But you must go with me. Timmins, go and get a carriage.\"  Timmins obeyed, and before Mr. Bayard had finished asking Bobby how all the people in Riverdale were, the carriage was at the door.  There was no backing out now, and our hero was obliged to get into the vehicle, though it seemed altogether too fine for a poor boy like him. Mr. Bayard and Mr. Butler (whom the former had invited to dine with him) seated themselves beside him, and the driver was directed to set them down at No. --, Chestnut Street, where they soon arrived.  Though my readers would, no doubt, be very much amused to learn how carefully Bobby trod the velvet carpets, how he stared with wonder at the drapery curtains, at the tall mirrors, the elegant chandeliers, and the fantastically shaped chairs and tables that adorned Mr. Bayard's parlor, the length of our story does not permit us to pause over these trivial matters.  When Ellen Bayard was informed that her little deliverer was in the house, she rushed into the parlor like a hoiden school girl, grasped both his hands, kissed both his rosy cheeks, and behaved just as though she had never been to a boarding school in her life.  She had thought a great deal about Bobby since that eventful day, and the more she thought of him, the more she liked him. Her admiration of him was not of that silly, sentimental character which moonstruck young ladies cherish towards those immaculate young men who have saved them from drowning in a horse pond, pulled them back just as they were tumbling over a precipice two thousand five hundred feet high, or rescued them from a house seven stories high, bearing them down a ladder seventy-five odd feet long. The fact was, Bobby was a boy of thirteen and there was no chance for much sentiment; so the young lady's regard was real, earnest, and lifelike.  Ellen said a great many very handsome things; but I am sure she never thought of such a thing as that he would run away with her, in case her papa was unnecessarily obstinate. She was very glad to see him, and I have no doubt she wished Bobby might be her brother, it would be so glorious to have such a noble little fellow always with her.  Bobby managed the dinner much better than he had anticipated; for Mr. Bayard insisted that he should sit down with them, whether he ate anything or not. But the Rubicon passed, our hero found that he had a pretty smart appetite, and did full justice to the viands set before him. It is true the silver forks, the napkins, the finger bowls, and other articles of luxury and show, to which he had been entirely unaccustomed, bothered him not a little; but he kept perfectly cool, and carefully observed how Mr. Butler, who sat next to him, handled the \"spoon fork,\" what he did with the napkin and the finger bowl, so that, I will venture to say, not one in ten would have suspected he had not spent his life in the parlor of a millionaire.  Dinner over, the party returned to the parlor, where Bobby unfolded his plan for the future. To make his story intelligible, he was obliged to tell them all about Mr. Hardhand.  \"The old wretch!\" exclaimed Mr. Bayard. \"But, Robert, you must let me advance the sixty dollars, to pay Squire Lee.\"  \"No, sir; you have done enough in that way. I have given my note for the money.\"  \"Whew!\" said Mr. Butler.  \"And I shall soon earn enough to pay it.\"  \"No doubt of it. You are a lad of courage and energy, and you will succeed in everything you undertake.\"  \"I shall want you to trust me for a stock of books, on the strength of old acquaintance,\" continued Bobby, who had now grown quite bold, and felt as much at home in the midst of the costly furniture, as he did in the \"living room\" of the old black house.  \"You shall have all the books you want.\"  \"I will pay for them as soon as I return. The truth is, Mr. Bayard, I mean to be independent. I didn't want to take that thirty-five dollars, though I don't know what Mr. Hardhand would have done to us, if I hadn't.\"  \"Ellen said I ought to have given you a hundred, and I think so myself.\"  \"I am glad you didn't. Too much money makes us fat and lazy.\"  Mr. Bayard laughed at the easy self-possession of the lad--at his big talk; though, big as it was, it meant something. When he proposed to go to the store, he told Bobby he had better stay at the house and rest himself.  \"No, sir; I want to start out to-morrow, and I must get ready to-day.\"  \"You had better put it off till the next day; you will feel more like it then.\"  \"Now or never,\" replied Bobby. \"That is my motto, sir. If we have anything to do, now is always the best time to do it. Dr. Franklin says, 'Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.'\"  \"Right, Robert! you shall have your own way. I wish my clerks would adopt some of Dr. Franklin's wise saws. I should be a great deal better off in the course of a year if they would.\"     CHAPTER IX  IN WHICH BOBBY OPENS VARIOUS ACCOUNTS, AND WINS HIS FIRST VICTORY   \"Now, Bobby, I understand your plan,\" said Mr. Bayard, when they reached the store; \"but the details must be settled. Where do you intend to go?\"  \"I hardly know, sir. I suppose I can sell books almost anywhere.\"  \"Very true; but in some places much better than in others.\"  Mr. Bayard mentioned a large town about eighteen miles from the city, in which he thought a good trade might be carried on, and Bobby at once decided to adopt the suggestion.  \"You can make this place your headquarters for the week; if books do not sell well right in the village, why, you can go out a little way, for the country in the vicinity is peopled by intelligent farmers, who are well off, and who can afford to buy books.\"  \"I was"]]]
