Eleven of them dipped in the milk and came out handsome young men. The Twelfth sat disconsolately on the window sill and remained a pigeon. The eleven laughed at him and twitted him with having had a bride that had betrayed him. Then the eleven went away laughing arm in arm. Before the Twelfth could fly after them, the Princess ran out from behind the door and cried:  \"My dear one, I have found you at last!\"  The Pigeon flew into her hands and she took him and kissed his coral beak and smoothed his gleaming plumage with her lips. Then she put him in the milk and the feather shirt opened and her own true love stepped out.  She led him at once to her father and when the King found him well trained in all the arts a prince should know he accepted him as his future son-in-law and presented him to the people.  So after all the Princess's mother was able to give her daughter the gorgeous wedding she had planned for years and years. Preparations were begun at once but the Queen insisted on making such vast quantities of little round cakes and candied fruits and sweetmeats of all kinds that it was three whole months before the wedding actually took place. By that time the roses were again blooming in the Princess's cheeks, her eyes were brighter than before, and her long shining hair was more golden than ever.  All the neighboring kings were invited to the wedding and when they saw the bride they shook their heads sadly and said among themselves:  \"Lost her looks indeed! What did people mean by saying such a thing? Why, she's the most beautiful princess in the world! What a pity she didn't marry one of our sons!\"  But when they met the Prince of her choice, they saw at once why the Princess had fallen in love with him.  \"Any girl would!\" they said.  It was a big wedding, as I told you before, and the only guest present who was not a king or a queen or a royal personage of some sort was the poor girl who saw the rooster with wooden shoes in the first place. The Queen, of course, had wanted only royalty but the Princess declared that the poor girl was her dear friend and would have to be invited. So the Queen, when she saw that the Princess was set on having her own way, had the poor girl come to the palace before the wedding and decked her out in rich clothes until people were sure that she was some strange princess whom the bride had met on her travels.  \"My dear,\" whispered the Princess as they sat down beside each other at the wedding feast, \"how beautiful you look!\"  \"But I'm not as beautiful as you!\" the girl said.  The Princess laughed.  \"Of course not! No one can be as beautiful as I am because I have the secret of beauty!\"  \"Dear Princess,\" the poor girl begged, \"won't you tell me the secret of beauty?\"  The Princess leaned over and whispered something in the poor girl's ear.  It was only one word:  \"Happiness!\"  [Illustration]     THE LITTLE LAME FOX   [Illustration]  _The Story of the Youngest Brother Who Found the Magic Grape-Vine and Married the Golden Maiden_     THE LITTLE LAME FOX   There was once a wealthy farmer who had three sons. The oldest was a selfish overbearing fellow. The second was a weak chap who always did everything his brother suggested. The youngest whose name was Janko was not as bright and clever as his brothers but he was honest and, moreover, he had a good heart and in this world a good heart, you know, is more likely to bring its owner happiness than wicked brains.  \"That booby!\" the oldest brother would say whenever he saw Janko. And the second would snicker and repeat the ugly word, \"Booby!\"  The father was proud of his three sons and happy to see them grow up strong and healthy.  \"They're good boys,\" he'd say to himself, \"and I'm a fortunate father.\"  Now there was one very curious thing about this farmer that nobody understood. One of his eyes was always laughing and the other was always weeping.  \"What's the matter with your father's eyes?\" people used to ask the sons.  The sons didn't know any more than any one else. One day they were in the garden discussing the matter among themselves.  \"Why don't we just go and ask him?\" Janko suggested.  \"If anybody is to ask him, I will!\" declared the oldest brother importantly.  So he went indoors to his father and said:  \"Father, people are forever talking about your eyes. Now I wish you would tell me why one of them is always laughing and the other always weeping.\"  \"My eyes, indeed!\" cried the farmer, and in a rage he snatched up a knife and hurled it straight at his son. The young man dodged aside and fled and the knife stuck in the door jamb.  All out of breath the oldest brother returned to the others but of course he was ashamed to tell them what had happened. So he said to them:  \"If you want to know what's the matter with father's eyes, you'll have to ask him yourselves.\"  So the second brother went in to the farmer and he had exactly the same experience. When he came out he gave his older brother a wink and said to Janko:  \"Now it is your turn, Booby. Father is waiting for you.\"  So Janko went in to his father and said:  \"You have told my brothers why one of your eyes is always laughing and the other always weeping. Now please tell me for I, too, want to know.\"  In a rage the farmer snatched up the knife again and lifted his arm to hurl it. But Janko stood perfectly still. Why should he turn and run away as though he had done something wrong? He had only asked his father a civil question and if his father did not wish to answer it, he could tell him so.  The farmer when he saw that the boy was not to be frightened smiled and laid the knife aside.  \"Thank God,\" he said, \"I have one son who is not a coward! I have been waiting these many years to have my sons ask me this very question. My right eye laughs because God has blessed me and made me rich and has allowed my three sons to grow to manhood, strong and healthy. My left eye weeps because I can never forget a Magic Grape-Vine which once grew in my garden. It used to give me a bucket of wine every hour of the twenty-four! One night a thief came and stole my Magic Vine and I have never heard of it since. Do you wonder that my left eye weeps at the memory of this wonderful Vine? Alas, the bucket of wine that used to flow out of it every hour of the day and night--I have never tasted its like since!\"  \"Father,\" Janko said, \"dry your weeping eye! I and my brothers will go out into the world and find your Magic Grape-Vine wherever it is hidden!\"  With that Janko ran out to his brothers and when they heard what he had to say they laughed and called him, \"Booby!\" and asked him didn't he suppose that they had already planned to do just this thing. Of course they hadn't, but they were so jealous and ill-natured that they couldn't bear the thought of his being the first to suggest anything.  \"We mustn't lose any more time,\" Janko said.  \"It doesn't matter how much time you lose, Mr. Booby! As for us we two are going to start out to-morrow at sunrise.\"  \"But, brothers,\" Janko begged, \"please let me go, too!\"  \"No!\" they told him shortly. \"You can stay home and look after the farm!\"  But their father when he heard the discussion said, no, Janko was also to go as he was the bravest of them all. After that the brothers, because they didn't want their father to tell how they had been afraid and run away, had to agree.  So the next morning early the three of them started out, each with a wallet well-stocked with food.  \"How are we going to get rid of the Booby?\" the second one whispered.  \"Trust me!\" the oldest one whispered back with a wink.  Presently they came to a crossroads where three roads branched. Now the oldest brother knew that after a short distance two of the roads came together again. So he motioned the second brother slyly that he was to take the middle road. Then he said:  \"Brothers, let us part here and each take a different road. Do you agree?\"  \"Yes,\" the other two said, \"we agree.\"  \"Then suppose Janko take the left-hand road.\"  \"And I'll take the middle road,\" the second cried.  \"And I,\" the eldest said, \"will take the one that's left. So farewell, brothers, and let us meet here in a year's time.\"  \"God bless us all,\" Janko called out, \"and grant that one of us may find our dear father's Magic Grape-Vine.\"  The two older brothers of course met in a short time when their roads joined and they had a good laugh to think how they had outwitted the Booby.  \"Time enough to look for that old Grape-Vine when we've had a little fun!\" the eldest said. \"Let us sit down here and eat a bite and then push on to the next village. There's an inn there where we can try our luck at cards.\"  So they sat down by the roadside, opened their wallets, and laid out some bread and cheese. Just then a Little Lame Fox came limping up on three feet, and whimpering and fawning it begged for something to eat.  \"Get out!\" bawled the older brother and the second, picking up a handful of stones, threw them at the Fox.  The little animal shied and then came timidly back, again begging for something to eat.  \"Let's kill it!\" cried one of the brothers.  They both jumped up and tried to strike the little creature with their sticks. The Fox limped off and they followed, hitting at it as they ran and always just missing it. It was so weak and lame that they expected every minute to overtake it and so kept on chasing it until it had led them pretty far into the woods. Then suddenly it disappeared and there was nothing left for the brothers to do but make their way back to the roadside grumbling and cursing. In their absence some shepherd dogs had found their open wallets and eaten all their food. So now they really had something to curse about.  Janko meanwhile had been trudging along steadily on the third road. At last when he began to feel hungry, he sat down by the wayside and opened his wallet. Instantly the same Little Lame Fox came limping up and whimpered and fawned "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],["title","The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#8)"],["body","begged for something to eat.  \"You poor little creature,\" Janko said, \"are you hungry?\"  He held out his hand coaxingly and the animal gave it a timid sniff.  \"Of course I'll give you something to eat,\" Janko said. \"There's enough for both of us.\"  With that he divided his bread and cheese and gave the Little Fox half. Then they ate together and the Little Fox allowed Janko to pat her head.  When they finished eating the Fox sat up on her haunches and said:  \"Now, Janko, tell me about yourself. Who are you and where are you going?\"  The Fox seemed such a sensible little person that it didn't surprise Janko in the least to have her sit up and talk. Janko's brothers would have said that he hadn't sense enough to be surprised. But he had a good heart, Janko had, and as you'll soon hear a good heart is a much better guide for conduct than wicked brains.  Janko answered the Fox simply and truthfully. He told about his father and his two brothers and about his father's weeping eye and the Magic Grape-Vine for which he and his brothers were gone in search.  \"You've been good to me,\" the Little Fox said. \"You've shared your bread with me and that makes us friends. So from now on if you'll be a brother to me, I'll be a little sister to you.\"  Goodness knows Janko's own brothers weren't very good to him, but Janko understood what the Little Fox meant and he agreed.  \"Well then, brother,\" the Fox said, \"I know where that Grape-Vine is and I'm going to help you to get it. If you do just as I say I don't believe you'll have any trouble. Now take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"  So Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and sure enough away they went. Whether they sailed through the air or just ran fleetly along the ground I don't know. But I do know that they went a great distance and that when they stopped Janko didn't feel in the least tired or breathless.  \"Now, my brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"listen carefully to what I tell you. The king of this country has a wonderful garden. In the midst of it your father's Grape-Vine is planted. We are close to the garden now. It is protected by twelve watches each of which is composed of twelve guards. To get to the Grape-Vine you will have to pass them all. Now as you approach each watch look carefully. If the eyes of all the guards are open and staring straight at you, have no fear. They sleep with their eyes open and they won't see you. But if their eyes are closed, then be careful for when their eyes are closed they are awake and ready to see you. You will find the Grape-Vine in the very center of the garden. Standing near it you will see two spades, a wooden spade and a golden spade. Take the wooden spade and dig up the Vine as quickly as you can. Under no condition touch the golden spade. Now, Janko, do you understand?\"  Yes, Janko thought he understood. He slipped into the garden and the first thing he saw were twelve fierce looking guards who were staring at him with great round eyes. He was much frightened until he remembered that the Little Fox had said that if their eyes were open they were fast asleep. So he picked up courage and walked straight by them and sure enough they didn't see him. He passed watch after watch in the same way and at last reached the center of the garden. He saw the Grape-Vine at once. There was no mistaking it for at that very moment it was pouring out wine of itself into a golden bucket. Near it were two spades, Janko in great excitement snatched up the first that came to his hand and began to dig. Alas, it was the golden spade and as Janko drove it into the earth it sent out a loud ringing sound that instantly woke the guards. They came running from all directions with their eyes tightly closed for now, of course, they were awake. They caught Janko and dragged him to the king to whom they said:  \"A thief! A thief! We found him trying to steal your Magic Grape-Vine!\"  \"My Magic Grape-Vine!\" thundered the king. \"Young man, what do you mean trying to steal my Magic Grape-Vine?\"  \"Well, you see,\" Janko answered simply, \"the Grape-Vine really belongs to my father. It was stolen from him years ago and ever since then his left eye has wept over the loss of it. Give me the Vine, O king, for if you don't I shall have to come back and try again to steal it for it belongs to my father and I have sworn to get it!\"  The king frowned in thought and at last he said:  \"I can't give away my precious Grape-Vine for nothing, young man, but I tell you what I'll do: I'll give it to you provided you get for me the Golden Apple-Tree that bears buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every twenty-four hours.\"  With that Janko was dismissed and turned out of the garden.  The Little Fox was waiting for him and Janko had the shame of confessing that he had forgotten the warning about the golden spade and had been caught.  \"But the king says he will give me the Grape-Vine provided I get for him the Golden Apple-Tree that bears buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every twenty-four hours.\"  \"Well, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"you were good to me, so I'll help you again. Take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"  Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and away they went a greater distance than before. In spite of going so quickly it took them a long time but whether it was weeks or months I don't know. Whichever it was when they stopped Janko didn't feel in the least tired or breathless.  \"Now, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"here we are in another country close to the king's garden where the Golden Apple-Tree grows. To reach it you will have to pass twenty-four watches of twelve guards each. Take care that you pass each guard as before when his eyes are wide open and staring straight at you for that means he is asleep. When you reach the Golden Apple-Tree you will see two long poles on the ground--a wooden pole and a golden pole. Take the wooden pole and beat down some of the golden fruit. Don't touch the golden pole. Remember!\"  So Janko crept into the second garden and succeeded in passing all the guards of the twenty-four watches when their eyes were wide open and staring straight at him. He reached the Golden Apple-Tree and saw at once the two long poles that were lying near it on the ground. Now whether because he was excited or because he forgot what the Fox said--he had a good heart, Janko had, but he was a little careless sometimes--I don't know. But I do know that instead of taking the wooden pole as the Fox had told him, he took the golden pole. At the first stroke of the golden pole against the golden branches of the tree, the golden branches sent out a loud clear whistle that woke all the sleeping guards. Every last one of them came running to the Apple-Tree and in no time at all they had captured poor Janko and carried him to their master, the king.  \"Trying to steal my Golden Apple-Tree, is he?\" roared the king in a great rage. \"What do you want with my Golden Apple-Tree, young man?\"  \"Well, you see,\" Janko answered simply, \"I have to have the Golden Apple-Tree to exchange it for the Magic Grape-Vine that really belongs to my father. It was stolen from him years ago and ever since then his left eye has wept over the loss of it. Give me the Golden Apple-Tree, O king, for if you don't I shall have to come back and try again to steal it.\"  The king seemed impressed with Janko's words for after a moment he said:  \"Janko, I can't give you the Golden Apple-Tree for nothing, but I tell you what I'll do: I'll let you have it provided you get for me the Golden Horse that can race around the world in twenty-four hours.\"  With that Janko was dismissed and turned out of the garden.  As usual the Little Fox was waiting for him and again Janko had the shame of confessing that he had forgotten the warning about the golden pole and had been caught.  \"But the king says he will give me the Golden Apple-Tree provided I get him the Golden Horse that can race around the world in twenty-four hours. I wonder, dear Little Fox, will you help me again?\"  \"Yes, brother, I will help you again for you were good to me. Take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"  So Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and away they went. How far they went and how long they were gone I don't know, but it was a great distance and a long time. However they arrived without feeling in the least tired or breathless.  \"Now, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"this time listen carefully to what I tell you. Here we are in another kingdom close to the king's own stable where the Golden Horse is guarded by thirty-six watches of twelve guards each. When night comes you must slip into the stable and pass all those guards when they are asleep with their eyes wide open and staring straight at you. When you reach the Golden Horse you will see hanging beside him a golden bridle and a common bridle made of hempen rope. Slip the hempen bridle over the Horse's head and lead him quietly out of the stable. But mind you don't touch the golden bridle! This time don't forget!\"  Janko promised faithfully to remember what the Little Fox said and when night came he crept into the stable and cautiously made his way through the sleeping guards. He reached at last the stall of the Golden Horse. It was the most beautiful horse in the world and the gleam of its shining flanks was like sunshine in the dark stable.  Janko stroked its golden mane and whispered softly into its ear. The horse responded to his touch and rubbed its muzzle against his shoulder.  Janko reached over to take the hempen bridle and then he paused. \"It would be an outrage,\" he thought to himself, \"to put a common rope on this glorious creature!\"  Just think of it! For the third time Janko forgot the Little Fox's warning! I have no excuse to make for him. I don't see how he could have forgotten a third time! But he did. He took the golden bridle instead of the hempen one and put it over the head of the Golden Horse. The Horse neighed and instantly all the"]]]
