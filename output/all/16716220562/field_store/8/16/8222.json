He turned now to Hanlon.  \"My very sincere thanks, young man, for your quickness and alertness in saving my life. I shall be eternally grateful.\"  Hanlon waved his hand deprecatingly. \"It was my job, sir. I'm sorry your day was spoiled that way.\"  \"I still can't make out why?\" The Simonidean said slowly, and Hanlon, probing, could sense that his mind was full of question marks. \"I'm not that important. If it had been the emperor\"--Hanlon caught an impression of loyalty and love for that dignitary--\"or even the Minister\"--here he caught a feeling of doubt and some dislike--\"it might make sense. Just as I cannot figure out why I should have been sent here for this purpose. It's almost ...\" he was silent, and Hanlon's probes found only puzzlement.  \"Nuts!\" the young Corpsman felt frustrated. \"If only I could really read minds! I think this guy knows something I want to learn, but I can't get the least idea of what it is.\"  But he kept trying, and not only with the mind of this one man he had been sent here to guard. He reached out to all other minds in the room, but none of them seemed to have any thoughts about the why of this unexpected happenstance. There were mostly feelings of anger that their beautiful new Embassy building had not been properly dedicated, and their ceremony ruined.  Abrams had sunk into a chair, and it soon became apparent to Hanlon that he wasn't planning on handling any of his other outside errands that day.  \"Will you want me any more, sir?\" he finally asked after a considerable period of uneasy fidgetting. The Simonidean broke out of his abstraction, and rose to his feet.  \"No, I shall stay here for the balance of the day at least. You may as well return to your other duties. Again, thank you, personally, for saving my life, and please express my thanks to the Corps for sending you. But I still can't understand ...\" He turned away, muttering.  Hanlon saluted the other members of the Embassy staff, and rode the slideways back to Base, reporting to Admiral Rogers, to whom he gave a full and concise account of all that had happened.  \"Whatever Mr. Abrams and the police may think, I still believe it was all carefully planned,\" he concluded thoughtfully. \"It wasn't just one man, for I could see at least a dozen. Though, of course,\" he added quickly, \"one man may have been behind it.\"  \"Undoubtedly,\" the admiral said. \"There was the chance of something like this, which is why I picked you for the job, hoping you could get some leads from it.\"  \"I told you I couldn't read specific thoughts or information,\" Hanlon said. \"If you and the top brass picked me for the SS because you thought I could, you'd better release me from it. I can't work in a crowd at all, for there's such a jumble of thought-emanations I can't separate them. Even working with an individual I can only sense something of his feelings. Just as now,\" he grinned mirthlessly, \"you're disappointed because I didn't get any data, and thinking my so-called mind-reading is all a fake.\"  The admiral almost jumped. \"Why, I am not ...,\" then he looked surprised, and laughed. \"By Snyder, I was, too!\" He sobered. \"But if you can do that, even if you can't actually read the words of the thought, you'll still be able to help, I'm sure. No, you keep on studying. I'll bet you'll be able to do a lot more before long.\"  \"I sure hope so,\" Hanlon slowly unfastened the aiguellettes and removed the sword and belt, laying them on the corner of the big desk. At touch of that weapon he suddenly realized what he had done with it, and shuddered, while his face grew white and strained.  \"What's the matter?\" the admiral asked anxiously.  \"I ... killed ... a ... man,\" Hanlon trembled.  \"No! You killed a snake!\" Admiral Rogers laid his arm comfortingly about the younger man's shoulders. \"It isn't the same at all. Don't let it bother you.\"  Hanlon tried manfully to rise from his dark mood. \"You're right, in a way, sir, and I'll try to look at it that way. As to the mind-reading, I'll keep on trying, and I hope I can prove of some use.\"  The admiral patted his shoulder encouragingly. \"You will. Dismiss.\"     Chapter 4   The cadets were all keyed up about graduation, now so near, and most of them were cramming at every opportunity on the subjects in which they felt themselves deficient. Such tenseness is natural before any final examinations, but in their case more so than it would have been in an ordinary school or university.  For not until the final marks were posted from these last examinations, plus their marks for the entire five years, would any of them--except Hanlon, of course--know for a surety that he would be graduated and become a permanent member of the Inter-Stellar Corps. And how intensely each of them wanted to belong!  Four days had now passed since George Hanlon's fateful interview with the Commandant of Cadets, and its unexpected outcome. He could hardly believe, even yet, that he was now actually a member of the unknown Secret Service of the Corps.  Only the great inner joy he knew at the recovery of his once-adored dad, and the complete dismissal of all those black hatreds, gave proof that it wasn't all a fantastic dream.  Hanlon hadn't experienced anything unusual in the cadet routine, and was growing more and more nervous as to just what was to happen to him. He still shivered every time he thought of that coming, dreaded ordeal. And all this waiting, this worrying, this wondering when--it wasn't making life any easier. If only they would get it over and done with!  But he strove to compose himself for it as best he could, and it was a measure of his inherent stability that he never let his comrades, even his roommate, see how apprehensive he was.  Now the day had come for the first of their finals. Hanlon never worried about exams, for he had always been near the top of his class. Now, especially, since he was already graduated and a Senior Lieutenant, he could have taken things easily. But pride in his scholarship made him anxious as always to do his best.  Their first examination was History, one of Hanlon's pet subjects, for he loved this story of Mankind, his ups and downs and gradual growth.  When the examination papers were handed out and he noted the first question he smiled. If only they were all that easy.       _\"Give briefly a resume of the events leading up to the formation      of the Inter-Stellar Corps.\"_  Hanlon uncapped his writo, and began:  \"In the middle of the Twentieth Century the various governments of Earth were all tending toward either a totalitarian or a welfare-form state. More and more power became vested in the Executive branch; more and more citizens were either working directly for government, or were supported by relief funds. Business was, to an increasingly greater extent, stifled by over-control. Public debts became a staggering load, and workers had less and less of their income available for living needs.  \"When atomic energy was first released by the United States, in the form of a bomb during a war, the military took complete control of it. Neither private nor industrial scientists or technicians were allowed to experiment with possibilities of getting power directly from atomic fission.  \"In 1958 a young man named Travis Burkett was elected to the United States Congress from California. During his four terms as member of the Lower House he became increasingly well-known as possessor of one of the finest minds in public life. In 1966 he was advanced to the Senate, and soon became its leading member.  \"In 1976 (prophetic year) he ran for President on the simple platform of 'give the country back to the people'. His ideas and views so fired the minds and hopes of the citizens of America, regimented and ground down by the cancerous growth of bureaucracy, that even most of the bureaucrats and reliefers joined to elect him by one of the greatest pluralities ever polled.  \"During his two terms of office, with the help of a Cabinet of men who believed as he did, he fulfilled his promises. The tremendous power of the Executive was gradually returned to the Legislative, where it belonged. Unnecessary, over-lapping, and duplicated bureaus and agencies were reduced to the minimum. Only persons actually in need were supported from the public purse. Where almost 80% of the citizenry had been working for or supported by government when he took office, less than 15% were doing so when he retired.  \"Tax restrictions and governmental meddling in industry and business were reduced save for a few necessary safe-guards of minimum-wage and maximum-safety laws. With these restrictions removed, and with control of so many vital sciences and technologies taken away from the military, inventions took an accelerated up-swing.  \"The peoples of other countries, fired by the realization of what could be done, staged revolutions, happily largely bloodless, and soon, working through the United Nations Council, a United World government became an actuality, and Burkett one of its first presidents.  \"An American named John Snyder had, years before, secretly worked out a simple and inexpensive method of obtaining practically unlimited power directly from atomic fission. Now he could legally bring this to the public, and soon homes, public transportation and industry were using his power method.  \"Snyder attracted to him a group of gifted scientists and technicians. These now turned their attention to space flight and Man, the Insatiable, began stretching out greedy hands to the Stars.  \"They put a robot rocket on the Moon in less than two years. Their third rocket carried two scientists who did not make the return trip--they stayed to study and to learn. Five years later the first ship landed on Mars, and within a decade that planet was largely colonized. So, two years later, was Venus. Another fifteen years saw colonization of most of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19660"],["title","Man of Many Minds (#5)"],["body","moons of the outer planets.  \"For, using new techniques and inventions learned from many experiments, the moons and planets were given air, water and warmth as needed. Android robots, developed by Varney, one of Snyder's scientists, helped greatly in this work, especially one young female android who was a true genius.  \"Then Man reached the Stars ... and the planets of those distant suns. It was here that the now-aged Snyder proved himself again one of the greatest humanitarians ever to have lived. He promulgated the ruling that is still in force:       _\"'Man must never colonize any planet having inhabitants      intelligent enough to show cultural activity and growth'._  \"Controlling all means of transportation between planets as he did, because he held all the basic patents, Snyder was able to enforce that ruling. To do so, he organized the 'Snyder Patrol', which later was taken over by the Federated Planets when that organization was formed, and became today's Inter-Stellar Corps.  \"Today there are fifty-seven planets colonized by former inhabitants of Tellus or their descendants from colonized planets. These each have their own sovereignty and chosen form of government, but are united in a loosely-knit Federation which is solely a Court of Arbitration for Inter-Planetary affairs. The I-S C is the Federation's Investigation and Enforcement branch, not a governing or military patrol.\"  Hanlon had finished that question and the second, which asked for the dates of the war between the colonists of Mars and those of the Jovian satellites. He was resting his eyes by glancing unseeingly about the room momentarily before starting the third question, when he heard the loud, angry voice of the instructor in charge.  \"Cadet Hanlon, on your feet, sir! Just how, Mister, do you think you can get away with cheating at a final examination?\"  Hanlon's head jerked up and his face went dead-white as the blood drained from it. He stumbled to his feet and, conscious of the amazed expressions of his classmates, looked up at the teacher.  \"Bu ... but I don't understand, sir. I wasn't cheating.\"  \"Don't lie to me!\" the voice was a whiplash. \"I distinctly saw you looking at Cadet Fox's paper. The idea of any cadet, this close to graduation, trying such a contemptible thing!\"  Hanlon's bewilderment was changing to anger at such an unjust accusation, when suddenly a thought struck him ...  _This was it!_  Cheating at examinations always meant expulsion and disgrace.  He had all he could do to keep from betraying himself as he probed quickly toward the mind on the rostrum. Now he perceived the feeling of commiseration which the stern, hot eyes of the apparently outraged instructor did not reveal.  Hanlon remembered his father's instructions to \"play it up big\". He made himself glare back at the teacher, and his blue eyes took on the hardness of glacial ice.  \"You're making a colossal mistake, sir,\" his voice was louder and angrier than it should ever have been. \"If our regular instructor was giving this exam he'd never make such an accusation. I've led this class in grades all through school. And not by cheating, either.\"  \"Lower your voice, Mister, and don't talk back!\" But Hanlon's mind-probing was receiving approbation now. \"I saw you cheating, and I know what I saw. Do you want to resign, or will you force me to take you to the commandant?\"  \"I don't know who you are, but you're a stupid fool!\" Hanlon apparently lost all control of himself, and his voice and red face showed the anger he was simulating so well. \"If you think you're going to frame me out of this class and out of graduating, you're a confounded idiot! Ask any of these chaps here--they all know I'm not a cheat.\"  But the cadets, though puzzled and dismayed, were far too clever to get mixed up in this unexpected brawl. They all sat, eyes lowered but faces straight ahead, arms folded across their chests, having no part in it at all.  The examining instructor, a man much larger and heavier than Hanlon's five feet eleven inches and one hundred and seventy-five pounds, rushed down from the platform. He grabbed at the cadet's arms, but Hanlon swivelled away, then stepped back in and struck at the officer.  That was mutiny! It was unthinkable for a cadet to strike an officer, under any circumstances or provocation.  The teacher, however, snared the cadet in a neo-judo hold that no neophyte, however skilled or strong could break. He dragged the struggling Hanlon up to the rostrum and, with his elbow, activated the intercom.  \"Ask the commandant to come to room 12-B. A cadet, caught cheating at examinations, has mutinied.\"  Still holding the struggling, angry Hanlon, the instructor-officer excoriated his victim for such breach of cadet honor. Hanlon, meanwhile, yelled insults and oaths. He twisted and squirmed as though trying to escape, although he had quickly realized he was now being held in a loose though apparently-valid grip he could have broken easily had he so desired.  Yet during all this Hanlon was receiving from the officer's mind the distinct impression that the latter hated what he was doing, yet was approving the way the new SS man was playing his part. Further, Hanlon sensed he was being welcomed into the fellowship of those unknown SS men to whom he was now brother.  Soon Admiral Rogers, followed by two hulking space marines, came running into the room.  \"What's going on here?\" he barked.  Quickly the teacher repeated his charges, while Hanlon yelled denials and vituperations at the moronic imbecile who dared accuse him of such treachery.  \"I'm ashamed of you, Hanlon!\" the admiral said coldly. \"We had high hopes for you, as I told you when I interviewed you about your initial assignment.\"  \"Then why don't you listen to me instead of taking the word of this slime-snake who calls himself an instructor? Bah! He oughta be digging ditches!\"  \"That'll do!\" Disgust showed on the admiral's face as he gestured to the marines, who jumped forward and grabbed Hanlon's arms, twisting them behind his back and handcuffing them.  \"George Hanlon, you are hereby officially dismissed from the Inter-Stellar Corps' Cadet School!\"  So saying, Admiral Rogers ripped all identifying symbols from Hanlon's uniform, then turned again to the marines. \"Take him outside the Reservation.\"  They hauled Hanlon, still shrieking and cursing, out of the room, out of the building, across the park, and to the gate of the Corps' property.  There his handcuffs were removed, and the sneering marines literally and not-too-gently booted him into the street, where he sprawled face downward in a muddy puddle.  Hanlon pulled himself erect, apparently mad clear through. He shook his fist at the grinning marines gathered just inside the gate. He cursed them fluently with every foul oath and name he could remember ever having heard. Innately clean of speech and thought, this swearing nearly gagged him. But he was \"putting on a good act.\"  They stood his insults for some time, but when he began to get too personal, a couple of them started toward him, their mocking laughter gone. To \"make his act better,\" Hanlon now pretended to be frightened, cowardly, and accompanied by the jeers of the civilian on-lookers who had quickly congregated to see what all the rumpus was about, he fled down the city street away from the Reservation.  At first opportunity, after he had outdistanced his pursuers, Hanlon ducked into an alley. He ran down this until he spotted the back door of a little cafe, and dodged inside. There, in the washroom, he cleaned himself as best he could.  Again somewhat presentable, he left by the front door and rode the slideways to a section of the city where he could buy some good but not too expensive clothing.  Now inconspicuously dressed, he got a hotel room, then went to the bank where he bought some shares of stock, arranged for insurance, and rented a deposit box.     Chapter 5   In the hotel room assigned him, George Hanlon threw himself on the bed and for an hour lay there reviewing this sudden, strange turn of events, and all it presaged. He tried in vain to thrust out of his mind the astonished consternation of his classmates, the sneers of the marines and the jeers of the civilians there at the gate, who had seen his disgrace. Almost in tears now, he realized at last this was but a prelude to years of being scorned and vilified as a despised outcast.  Finally he calmed a bit, then got up to pace the room, wondering what the next move would be. The answer came almost at once. A rap on the door disclosed a messenger with a package for him. On opening it, after the man had gone, Hanlon found the sleep-instructor and reels. On top was a smaller reel marked, \"No. 1. Listen to this awake.\"  He plugged in the machine, and put on the reel. It was his father's voice.  \"You've got this far, now begins your real work. You should be able to memorize the contents of these reels in two weeks. Briefly, here is what they contain. Simonides Four was colonized under the direction of a Greek merchant who gave it his name. Four is the only habitable planet. Most of the original inhabitants under him were of his nationality, and the present language is an outgrowth of modern Greek, which you know somewhat. There are now, of course, many variations and new words, terms peculiar to their growing and evolving culture. The reels give all this more fully.  \"The last reel tells their history, geography and economic situation as of today. Also, details about their various large cities, especially New Athens, their capitol. We believe you will find that city the best place to start your investigations. When you have these reels memorized, go to the bank, get your final instructions from the box, and your money for the trip.  \"As to the problem, again briefly this is it: In the past year or so Federation agents have sensed a movement there, but have not been able to interpret it. Whatever it is, it is very,"]]]
