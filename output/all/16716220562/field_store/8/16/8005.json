Then we may not even sing the new psalms; but ribald songs, as many as we please. And why? There is heresy in them, they say, and heaven knows what. I have sung some of them, however; they are new, to be sure, but I see no harm in them.  Buyck. Ask their leave, forsooth! In our province, we sing just what we please. That's because Count Egmont is our stadtholder, who does not trouble himself about such matters. In Ghent, Ypres, and throughout the whole of Flanders, anybody sings them that chooses. (Aloud to Ruysum.) There is nothing more harmless than a spiritual song--Is there, father?  Ruysum. What, indeed! It is a godly work, and truly edifying.  Jetter. They say, however, that they are not of the right sort, not of their sort, and, since it is dangerous, we had better leave them alone. The officers of the Inquisition are always lurking and spying about; many an honest fellow has already fallen into their clutches. They had not gone so far as to meddle with conscience! If they will not allow me to do what I like, they might at least let me think and sing as I please.  Soest. The Inquisition won't do here. We are not made like the Spaniards, to let our consciences be tyrannized over. The nobles must look to it, and clip its wings betimes.  Jetter. It is a great bore. Whenever it comes into their worships' heads to break into my house, and I am sitting there at my work, humming a French psalm, thinking nothing about it, neither good nor bad--singing it just because it is in my throat;--forthwith I'm a heretic, and am clapped into prison. Or if I am passing through the country, and stand near a crowd listening to a new preacher, one of those who have come from Germany; instantly I'm called a rebel, and am in danger of losing my head! Have you ever heard one of these preachers?  Soest. Brave fellows! Not long ago, I heard one of them preach in a field, before thousands and thousands of people. A different sort of dish he gave us from that of our humdrum preachers, who, from the pulpit, choke their hearers with scraps of Latin. He spoke from his heart; told us how we had till now been led by the nose, how we had been kept in darkness, and how we might procure more light;--ay, and he proved it all out of the Bible.  Jetter. There may be something in it. I always said as much, and have often pondered over the matter. It has long been running in my head.  Buyck. All the people run after them.  Soest. No wonder, since they hear both what is good and what is new.  Jetter. And what is it all about? Surely they might let every one preach after his own fashion.  Buyck. Come, sirs! While you are talking, you; forget the wine and the Prince of Orange.  Jetter. We must not forget him. He's a very wall of defence. In thinking of him, one fancies, that if one could only hide behind him, the devil himself could not get at one. Here's to William of Orange! Hurrah!  All. Hurrah! Hurrah!  Soest. Now, grey-beard, let's have your toast.  Ruysum. Here's to old soldiers! To all soldiers! War for ever!  Buyck. Bravo, old fellow. Here's to all soldiers. War for ever!  Jetter. War! War! Do ye know what ye are shouting about? That it should slip glibly from your tongue is natural enough; but what wretched work it is for us, I have not words to tell you. To be stunned the whole year round by the beating of the drum; to hear of nothing except how one troop marched here, and another there; how they came over this height, and halted near that mill; how many were left dead on this field, and how many on that; how they press forward, and how one wins, and another loses, without being able to comprehend what they are fighting about; how a town is taken, how the citizens are put to the sword, and how it fares with the poor women and innocent children. This is a grief and a trouble, and then one thinks every moment, \"Here they come! It will be our turn next.\"  Soest. Therefore every citizen must be practised in the use of arms.  Jetter. Fine talking, indeed, for him who has a wife and children. And yet I would rather hear of soldiers than see them.  Buyck. I might take offence at that.  Jetter. It was not intended for you, countryman. When we got rid of the Spanish garrison, we breathed freely again.  Soest. Faith! They pressed on you heavily enough.  Jetter. Mind your own business.  Soest. They came to sharp quarters with you.  Jetter. Hold your tongue.  Soest. They drove him out of kitchen, cellar, chamber--and bed. (They laugh.)  Jetter. You are a blockhead.  Buyck. Peace, sirs! Must the soldier cry peace? Since you will not hear anything about us, let us have a toast of your own--a citizen's toast.  Jetter. We're all ready for that! Safety and peace!  Soest. Order and freedom!  Buyck. Bravo! That will content us all.  (They ring their glasses together, and joyously repeat the words, but in such a manner that each utters a different sound, and it becomes a kind of chant. The old man listens, and at length joins in.)  All. Safety and peace! Order and freedom!    SCENE II.---Palace of the Regent  Margaret of Parma (in a hunting dress). Courtiers, Pages, Servants  Regent. Put off the hunt, I shall not ride to-day. Bid Machiavel attend me.  [Exeunt all but the Regent.  The thought of these terrible events leaves me no repose! Nothing can amuse, nothing divert my mind. These images, these cares are always before me. The king will now say that these are the natural fruits of my kindness, of my clemency; yet my conscience assures me that I have adopted the wisest, the most prudent course. Ought I sooner to have kindled, and spread abroad these flames with the breath of wrath? My hope was to keep them in, to let them smoulder in their own ashes. Yes, my inward conviction, and my knowledge of the circumstances, justify my conduct in my own eyes; but in what light will it appear to my brother! For, can it be denied that the insolence of these foreign teachers waxes daily more audacious? They have desecrated our sanctuaries, unsettled the dull minds of the people, and conjured up amongst them a spirit of delusion. Impure spirits have mingled among the insurgents, horrible deeds have been perpetrated, which to think of makes one shudder, and of these a circumstantial account must be transmitted instantly to court. Prompt and minute must be my communication, lest rumour outrun my messenger, and the king suspect that some particulars have been purposely withheld. I can see no means, severe or mild, by which to stem the evil. Oh, what are we great ones on the waves of humanity? We think to control them, and are ourselves driven to and fro, hither and thither.  [Enter Machiavel.  Regent. Are the despatches to the king prepared?  Machiavel. In an hour they will be ready for your signature.  Regent. Have you made the report sufficiently circumstantial?  Machiavel. Full and circumstantial, as the king loves to have it. I relate how the rage of the iconoclasts first broke out at St. Omer. How a furious multitude, with staves, hatchets, hammers, ladders, and cords, accompanied by a few armed men, first assailed the chapels, churches, and convents, drove out the worshippers, forced the barred gates, threw everything into confusion, tore down the altars, destroyed the statues of the saints, defaced the pictures, and dashed to atoms, and trampled under foot, whatever came in their way that was consecrated and holy. How the crowd increased as it advanced, and how the inhabitants of Ypres opened their gates at its approach. How, with incredible rapidity, they demolished the cathedral, and burned the library of the bishop. How a vast multitude, possessed by the like frenzy, dispersed themselves through Menin, Comines, Verviers, Lille, nowhere encountered opposition; and how, through almost the whole of Flanders, in a single moment, the monstrous conspiracy declared itself, and was accomplished.  Regent. Alas! Your recital rends my heart anew; and the fear that the evil will wax greater and greater, adds to my grief. Tell me your thoughts, Machiavel!  Machiavel. Pardon me, your Highness, my thoughts will appear to you but as idle fancies; and though you always seem well satisfied with my services, you have seldom felt inclined to follow my advice. How often have you said in jest: \"You see too far, Machiavel! You should be an historian; he who acts, must provide for the exigence of the hour.\" And yet have I not predicted this terrible history? Have I not foreseen it all?  Regent. I too foresee many things, without being able to avert them.  Machiavel. In one word, then:---you will not be able to suppress the new faith. Let it be recognized, separate its votaries from the true believers, give them churches of their own, include them within the pale of social order, subject them to the restraints of law,--do this, and you will at once tranquillize the insurgents. All other measures will prove abortive, and you will depopulate the country.  Regent. Have you forgotten with what aversion the mere suggestion of toleration was rejected by my brother? Know you not, how in every letter he urgently recommends to me the maintenance of the true faith? That he will not hear of tranquility and order being restored at the expense of religion? Even in the provinces, does he not maintain spies, unknown to us, in order to ascertain who inclines to the new doctrines? Has he not, to our astonishment, named to us this or that individual residing in our very neighbourhood, who, without its being known, was obnoxious to the charge of heresy? Does he not enjoin harshness and severity? and am I to be lenient? Am I to recommend for his adoption measures of indulgence and toleration? Should I not thus lose all credit with him, and at once forfeit his confidence?  Machiavel. I know it. The king commands and puts you in full possession of his intentions. You are to restore tranquillity and peace by measures which cannot fail"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1945"],["title","Egmont (#2)"],["body","more to embitter men's minds, and which must inevitably kindle the flames of war from one extremity of the country to the other. Consider well what you are doing. The principal merchants are infected--nobles, citizens, soldiers. What avails persisting in our opinion, when everything is changing around us? Oh, that some good genius would suggest to Philip that it better becomes a monarch to govern burghers of two different creeds, than to excite them to mutual destruction.  Regent. Never let me hear such words again. Full well I know that the policy of statesmen rarely maintains truth and fidelity; that it excludes from the heart candour, charity, toleration. In secular affairs, this is, alas! only too true; but shall we trifle with God as we do with each other? Shall we be indifferent to our established faith, for the sake of which so many have sacrificed their lives? Shall we abandon it to these far-fetched, uncertain, and self-contradicting heresies?  Machiavel. Think not the worse of me for what I have uttered.  Regent. I know you and your fidelity. I know too that a man may be both honest and sagacious, and yet miss the best and nearest way to the salvation of his soul. There are others, Machiavel, men whom I esteem, yet whom I needs must blame.  Machiavel. To whom do you refer?  Regent. I must confess that Egmont caused me to-day deep and heart-felt annoyance.  Machiavel. How so?  Regent. By his accustomed demeanour, his usual indifference and levity. I received the fatal tidings as I was leaving church, attended by him and several others. I did not restrain my anguish, I broke forth into lamentations, loud and deep, and turning to him, exclaimed, \"See what is going on in your province! Do you suffer it, Count, you, in whom the king confided so implicitly?\"  Machiavel. And what was his reply?  Regent. As if it were a mere trifle, an affair of no moment, he answered: \"Were the Netherlanders but satisfied as to their constitution! The rest would soon follow.\"  Machiavel. There was, perhaps, more truth than discretion or piety in his words. How can we hope to acquire and to maintain the confidence of the Netherlander, when he sees that we are more interested in appropriating his possessions, than in promoting his welfare, temporal or spiritual? Does the number of souls saved by the new bishops exceed that of the fat benefices they have swallowed? And are they not for the most part foreigners? As yet, the office of stadtholder has been held by Netherlanders; but do not the Spaniards betray their great and irresistible desire to possess themselves of these places? Will not people prefer being governed by their own countrymen, and according to their ancient customs, rather than by foreigners, who, from their first entrance into the land, endeavour to enrich themselves at the general expense, who measure everything by a foreign standard, and who exercise their authority without cordiality or sympathy?  Regent. You take part with our opponents?  Machiavel. Assuredly not in my heart. Would that with my understanding I could be wholly on our side!  Regent. If such your disposition, it were better I should resign the regency to them; for both Egmont and Orange entertained great hopes of occupying this position. Then they were adversaries, now they are leagued against me, and have become friends--inseparable friends.  Machiavel. A dangerous pair.  Regent. To speak candidly, I fear Orange.--I fear for Egmont.--Orange meditates some dangerous scheme, his thoughts are far-reaching, he is reserved, appears to accede to everything, never contradicts, and while maintaining the show of reverence, with clear foresight accomplishes his own designs.  Machiavel. Egmont, on the contrary, advances with a bold step, as if the world were all his own.  Regent. He bears his head as proudly as if the hand of majesty were not suspended over him.  Machiavel. The eyes of all the people are fixed upon him, and he is the idol of their hearts.  Regent. He has never assumed the least disguise, and carries himself as if no one had a right to call him to account. He still bears the name of Egmont. Count Egmont is the title by which he loves to hear himself addressed, as though he would fain be reminded that his ancestors were masters of Guelderland. Why does he not assume his proper title,--Prince of Gaure? What object has he in view? Would he again revive extinguished claims?  Machiavel. I hold him for a faithful servant of the king.  Regent. Were he so inclined, what important service could he not render to the government? Whereas, now, without benefiting himself, he has caused us unspeakable vexation. His banquets and entertainment have done more to unite the nobles and to knit them together than the most dangerous secret associations. With his toasts, his guests have drunk in a permanent intoxication, a giddy frenzy, that never subsides. How often have his facetious jests stirred up the minds of the populace? and what an excitement was produced among the mob by the new liveries, and the extravagant devices of his followers!  Machiavel. I am convinced he had no design.  Regent. Be that as it may, it is bad enough. As I said before, he injures us without benefiting himself. He treats as a jest matters of serious import; and, not to appear negligent and remiss, we are forced to treat seriously what he intended as a jest. Thus one urges on the other; and what we are endeavouring to avert is actually brought to pass. He is more dangerous than the acknowledged head of a conspiracy; and I am much mistaken if it is not all remembered against him at court. I cannot deny that scarcely a day passes in which he does not wound me--deeply wound me.  Machiavel. He appears to me to act on all occasions, according to the dictates of his conscience.  Regent. His conscience has a convenient mirror. His demeanour is often offensive. He carries himself as if he felt he were the master here, and were withheld by courtesy alone from making us feel his supremacy; as if he would not exactly drive us out of the country; there'll be no need for that.  Machiavel. I entreat you, put not too harsh a construction upon his frank and joyous temper, which treats lightly matters of serious moment. You but injure yourself and him.  Regent. I interpret nothing. I speak only of inevitable consequences, and I know him. His patent of nobility and the Golden Fleece upon his breast strengthen his confidence, his audacity. Both can protect him against any sudden outbreak of royal displeasure. Consider the matter closely, and he is alone responsible for the whole mischief that has broken out in Flanders. From the first, he connived at the proceedings of the foreign teachers, avoided stringent measures, and perhaps rejoiced in secret that they gave us so much to do. Let me alone; on this occasion, I will give utterance to that which weighs upon my heart; I will not shoot my arrow in vain. I know where he is vulnerable. For he is vulnerable.  Machiavel. Have you summoned the council? Will Orange attend?  Regent. I have sent for him to Antwerp. I will lay upon their shoulders the burden of responsibility; they shall either strenuously co-operate with me in quelling the evil, or at once declare themselves rebels. Let the letters be completed without delay, and bring them for my signature. Then hasten to despatch the trusty Vasca to Madrid, he is faithful and indefatigable; let him use all diligence, that he may not be anticipated by common report, that my brother, may receive the intelligence first through him. I will myself speak with him ere he departs.  Machiavel. Your orders shall be promptly and punctually obeyed.    SCENE III.--Citizen's House  Clara, her Mother, Brackenburg  Clara. Will you not hold the yarn for me, Brackenburg?  Brackenburg. I entreat you, excuse me, Clara.  Clara. What ails you? Why refuse me this trifling service?  Brackenburg. When I hold the yarn, I stand as it were spell-bound before you, and cannot escape your eyes.  Clara. Nonsense! Come and hold!  Mother. (knitting in her arm-chair). Give us a song! You used to be merry once, and I had always something to laugh at.  Brackenburg. Once!  Clara. Well, let us sing.  Brackenburg. As you please.  Clara. Merrily, then, and sing away! 'Tis a soldier's song, my favourite.  (She winds yarn, and sings with Brackenburg.)       The drum is resounding,      And shrill the fife plays;      My love, for the battle,      His brave troop arrays;      He lifts his lance high,      And the people he sways.      My blood it is boiling!      My heart throbs pit-pat!      Oh, had I a jacket,      With hose and with hat!      How boldly I'd follow,      And march through the gate;      Through all the wide province      I'd follow him straight.      The foe yield, we capture      Or shoot them! Ah, me!      What heart-thrilling rapture      A soldier to be!  (During the song, Brackenburg has frequently looked at Clara; at length his voice falters, his eyes fill with tears, he lets the skein fall, and goes to the window. Clara finishes the song alone, her Mother motions to her, half displeased, she rises, advances a few steps towards him, turns back, as if irresolute, and again sits down.)  Mother. What is going on in the street, Brackenburg? I hear soldiers marching.  Brackenburg. It is the Regent's body-guard.  Clara. At this hour? What can it mean? (She rises and joins Brackenburg at the window.) That is not the daily guard; it is more numerous! almost all the troops! Oh, Brackenburg, go! Learn what it means. It must be something unusual. Go, good Brackenburg, do me this favour.  Brackenburg. I am going! I will return immediately. (He offers his hand to Clara, and she gives him hers.)  [Exit Brackenburg.  Mother. Thou sendest him away so soon!  Clara. I am curious; and, besides--do not be angry, Mother--his presence pains me. I never know how I ought to behave towards him. I have done him a wrong, and it goes to my"]]]
