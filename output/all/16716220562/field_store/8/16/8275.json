A church almost razed to the ground, with the spire blown off and buried point down in the earth, moulders in    (p. 081) ruins at the back. It is said that the ghosts of dead monks pray nightly at the shattered altar, and some of our men state that they often hear the organ playing when they stand as sentries on the banquette.  \"The fire trench to-night,\" said Stoner that evening, a nervous light in his soft brown eyes, as he fumbled with the money on the card table. His luck had been good, and he had won over six francs; he generally loses. \"Perhaps we're in for the high jump when we get up there.\"  \"The high jump?\" I queried, \"what's that?\"  \"A bayonet charge,\" he replied, dealing a final hand and inviting us to double the stakes as the deal was the last. A few wanted to play for another quarter of an hour, but he would not prolong the game. Turning up an ace he shoved the money in his pocket and rose to his feet.  In an hour we were ready to move. We carried much weight in addition to our ordinary load, firewood, cooking utensils, and extra loaves. We bought the latter at a neighbouring _boulangerie_, one that still plied its usual trade in dangerous proximity to the firing-line.  The loaves cost 6-1/2_d._ each, and we prefer them to the English  (p. 082) bread which we get now and again, and place them far above the tooth-destroying army biscuits. Fires were permitted in the trenches, we were told, and our officers advised us to carry our own wood with us. So it came about that the enemy's firing served as a useful purpose; we pulled down the shrapnel shattered rafters of our billets, broke them up into splinters with our entrenching tools, and tied them up into handy portable bundles which we tied on our packs.  At midnight we entered Harley Street, and squeezed our way through the narrow trench. The distance to the firing-line was a long one; traverse and turning, turning and traverse, we thought we should never come to the end of them. There was no shelling, but the questing bullet was busy, it sung over our heads or snapped at the sandbags on the parapet, ever busy on the errand of death and keen on its mission. But deep down in the trench we regarded it with indifference. Our way was one of safety. Here the bullet was foiled, and pick and shovel reigned masters in the zone of death.  We were relieving the Scots Guards (many of my Irish friends       (p. 083) belong to this regiment). Awaiting our coming, they stood in the full marching order of the regulations, packs light, forks and spoons in their putties, and all little luxuries which we still dared to carry flung away. They had been holding the place for seven days, and were now going back somewhere for a rest.  \"Is this the firing-line?\" asked Stoner.  \"Yes, sonny,\" came the answer in a voice which seemed to be full of weariness.  \"Quiet here?\" Mervin enquired, a note of awe in his voice.  \"Naethin' doin',\" said a fresh voice that reminded me forcibly of Glasgow and the Cowcaddens. \"It's a gey soft job here.\"  \"No casualties?\"  \"Yin or twa stuck their heads o'er the parapet when they shouldn't and they copped it,\" said Glasgow, \"but barrin' that 'twas quiet.\"  In the traverse where I was planted I dropped into Ireland; heaps of it. There was the brogue that could be cut with a knife, and the humour that survived Mons and the Marne, and the kindliness that sprang from the cabins of Corrymeela and the moors of Derrynane.  \"Irish?\" I asked.                                                  (p. 084)  \"Sure,\" was the answer. \"We're everywhere. Ye'll find us in a Gurkha regiment if you scratch the beggars' skins. Ye're not Irish!\"  \"I am,\" I answered.  \"Then you've lost your brogue on the boat that took ye over,\" somebody said. \"Are ye dry?\"  I wiped the sweat from my forehead as I sat down on the banquette. \"Is there something to drink?\" I queried.  \"There's a drop of cold tay, me boy,\" the man near me replied. \"Where's yer mess-tin, Mike?\"  A tin was handed to me, and I drank greedily of the cold black tea. The man Mike gave some useful hints on trench work.  \"It's the Saxons that's across the road,\" he said, pointing to the enemy's lines which were very silent. I had not heard a bullet whistle over since I entered the trench. On the left was an interesting rifle and machine gun fire all the time. \"They're quiet fellows, the Saxons, they don't want to fight any more than we do, so there's a kind of understanding between us. Don't fire at us and we'll not fire at you. There's a good dug-out there,\" he continued, pointing to a dark    (p. 085) hole in the parados (the rear wall of the trench), \"and ye'll find a pot of jam and half a loaf in the corner. There's also a water jar half full.\"  \"Where do you get water?\"  \"Nearly a mile away the pump is,\" he answered. \"Ye've to cross the fields to get it.\"  \"A safe road?\" asked Stoner.  \"Not so bad, ye know,\" was the answer.  \"This place smells 'orrid,\" muttered Bill, lighting a cigarette and flinging on his pack. \"What is it?\"  \"Some poor devils between the trenches; they've been lyin' there since last Christmas.\"  \"Blimey, what a stink,\" muttered Bill, \"Why don't ye bury them up?\"  \"Because nobody dare go out there, me boy,\" was the answer. \"Anyway, it's Germans they are. They made a charge and didn't get as far as here. They went out of step so to speak.\"  \"Woo-oo-oo!\" Bill suddenly yelled and kicked a tin pail on to the floor of the trench. A shower of sparks flew up into the air and fluttered over the rim of the parapet. \"I put my 'and on it, 'twas like a    (p. 086) red 'ot poker, it burned me to the bone!\"  \"It's the brazier ye were foolin' about with,\" said Mike, who was buckling his pack-straps preparatory to moving, \"See, and don't put yer head over the top, and don't light a fire at night. Ye can put up as much flare as you like by day. Good-bye, boys, and good luck t'ye.\"  \"Any Donegal men in the battalion?\" I called after him as he was moving off.  \"None that I know of,\" he shouted back, \"but there are two other battalions that are not here, maybe there are Donegal men there. Good luck, boys, good luck!\"  We were alone and lonely, nearly every man of us. For myself I felt isolated from the whole world, alone in front of the little line of sand bags with my rifle in my hand. Who were we? Why were we there? Goliath, the junior clerk, who loved Tennyson; Pryor, the draughtsman, who doted on Omar; Kore, who read Fanny Eden's penny stories, and never disclosed his profession; Mervin, the traveller, educated for the Church but schooled in romance; Stoner, the clerk, who reads my books and says he never read better; and Bill, newsboy, street-arab, and Lord knows what, who reads _The Police News_, plays            (p. 087) innumerable tricks with cards, and gambles and never wins. Why were we here holding a line of trench, and ready to take a life or give one as occasion required? Who shall give an answer to the question?     CHAPTER VII                                                        (p. 088)  BLOOD AND IRON--AND DEATH    At night the stars are shining bright,     The old-world voice is whispering near,   We've heard it when the moon was light,     And London's streets were verydear;   But dearer now they are, sweetheart,     The 'buses running to the Strand,   But we're so far, so far apart,     Each lonely in a different land.   The night was murky and the air was splashed with rain. Following the line of trench I could dimly discern the figures of my mates pulling off their packs and fixing their bayonets. These glittered brightly as the dying fires from the trench braziers caught them, and the long array of polished blades shone into their place along the dark brown sandbags. Looking over the parados I could see the country in rear, dim in the hazy night. A white, nebulous fog lay on the ground and enveloped the lone trees that stood up behind. Here and there I could discern houses where no light shone, and where no people dwelt. All the inhabitants were gone, and in the village away to the right    (p. 089) there was absolute silence, the stillness of the desert. To my mind came words I once read or heard spoken, \"The conqueror turns the country into a desert, and calls it peace.\"  I clamped my bayonet into its standard and rested the cold steel on the parapet, the point showing over; and standing up I looked across to the enemy's ground.  \"They're about three hundred yards away,\" somebody whispered taking his place at my side. \"I think I can see their trenches.\"  An indistinct line which might have been a parapet of sandbags, became visible as I stared through the darkness; it looked very near, and my heart thrilled as I watched. Suddenly a stream of red sparks swooped upwards into the air and circled towards us. Involuntarily I stooped under cover, then raised my head again. High up in the air a bright flame stood motionless lighting up the ground in front, the space between the lines. Every object was visible: a tree stripped of all its branches stood bare, outlined in black; at its foot I could see the barbed wire entanglements, the wire sparkling as if burnished; further back was a ruined cottage, the bare beams and rafters giving it the appearance of a skeleton. A year ago a humble farmer might  (p. 090) have lived there; his children perhaps played where dead were lying. I could see the German trench, the row of sandbags, the country to rear, a ruined village on a hill, the flashes of rifles on the left ... the flare died out in mid-air and darkness cloaked the whole scene again.  \"What do you think of it, Stoner?\" I asked the figure by my side.  \"My God, it's great,\" he answered. \"To think that they're over there, and the poor fellows lying out on the field!\"  \"They're their own bloomin' tombstones, anyway,\" said Bill, cropping up from somewhere.  \"I feel sorry for the poor beggars,\" I said.  \"They'll feel sorry for themselves, the beggars,\" said Bill."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],["title","The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#0)"],["body","=THE LAUGHING PRINCE=  A book of Jugoslav Fairy Tales and Folk Tales.

The gorgeousness of the imagery in the stories, their rollicking humor, the adventures, were entirely new to child and adult readers. The stories in this third volume reflect the folk lore of many races, for the country now known as Jugoslavia has been one of the great highways and battlefields of the world where Orient and Occident, Greek and Roman, Turk and Slav have fought out their national aspirations. Basically, it has the Slavic exuberance of imagination and humor, but it has also absorbed much of the spirit and tales of the Near and Far East.  _Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc._ 757 THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK 17, N.

COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY  PARKER FILLMORE  RENEWED BY LOUISE FILLMORE  0.1.68   PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA     TO BUTTON  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     NOTE   In calling this _A Book of Jugoslav Fairy Tales and Folk Tales_ I have used the word Jugoslav in its literal sense of Southern Slav. The Bulgars are just as truly Southern Slavs as the Serbs or Croats or any other of the Slav peoples now included within the state of Jugoslavia. Moreover in this case it would be particularly difficult to make the literary boundaries conform strictly to the political boundaries since much the same stories and folk tales are current among all these Slav peoples of the Balkan Peninsula. The special student taking the variants of the same story might discover special differences that would mark each variant as the product of some one locality. The work of such a student would have philological and ethnological value but not a very strong appeal to the general reader. My appeal is first of all to the general reader--to the child who loves fairy tales and to the adult who loves them. I hope they will both find these stories entertaining and amusing quite aside from any interest in their source.  Yet these tales as presented do give the reader a true idea of the amazing vigor and the artistic inventiveness of the Jugoslav imagination, and also of the various influences, Oriental and Northern as well as Slavic, which have made that imagination what it is to-day. Here are gay picaresque tales of adventure--how they go on and on and on!--charming little stories of sentiment, a few folk tales of stark simplicity and grim humor, one story showing a superficial Turkish influence, and one spiritual allegory as deep and moving as anything in the Russian.  The renderings in every case are my own and are not in any sense translations. I have taken the old stories and retold them in a new language. To do them justice in this new language I have found it necessary to present them with a new selection of detail and with an occasional shifting of emphasis. I do not mean by this that I have invented detail in any unwarranted fashion. I haven't had to for any folk tale, however bald, contains all sorts of things by implication. The true story teller, it seems to me, is he who is able to grasp these implications and turn them to his own use.  I must confess that the setting in which I have placed the famous old Serbian nonsense story, _In my young days when I was an old, old man_, is my own invention. The nonsense story needs a setting and as it chanced I had one ready as I have long wanted to tell the world what was back of the determination of that princess who refused to eat until some one had made her laugh.  So far as I know most of these stories are not familiar to English readers--certainly not in this form. Madame Mijatovich uses one of them in her _Serbian Fairy Tales_, but I make no apology for offering a sprightlier version. Nor do I apologize for presenting any stories that may have been included somewhere among the indifferent translations to which Andrew Lang lent his name.  I am of course deeply indebted to the various people who told me these stories in the first place and to many scholarly folklorists, Jugoslav, Czechoslovak, Bulgarian, German, and English whose books and reports I have studied.

The eldest son was a studious boy who learned so much out of books that the farmer said:  \"We must send Mihailo to school and make a priest of him.\"  The second boy was a trader. Whatever you had he would get it from you by offering you something else for it. And always what he gave you was worth less than what you gave him.  \"Jakov will make a fine peddler,\" the farmer said. \"He's industrious and sharp and some day he will probably be a rich man.\"  But Stefan, the farmer's youngest son, had no special talent and because he didn't spend all his time with his nose in a book and because he never made the best of a bargain his brothers scorned him. Militza, his little sister, loved him dearly for he was kind and jolly and in the evening he was always ready to tell her stories and play with her. But the farmer, of course, listened to the older brothers.  \"I don't know about poor Stefan,\" he used to say. \"He's a good boy but he talks nonsense. I suppose he'll have to stay on the farm and work.\"  Now the truth is the farm was a fine place for Stefan for he was strong and lusty and he liked to plow and harvest and he had a wonderful way with the animals. He talked to them as if they were human beings and the horses all whinnied when he came near, and the cows rubbed their soft noses against his shoulder, and as for the pigs--they loved him so much that whenever they saw him they used to run squealing between his legs.  \"Stefan is nothing but a farmer!\" Mihailo used to say as though being a farmer was something to be ashamed of.  And Jakov said:  \"If the village people could see the pigs following him about, how they'd laugh at him! I hope when I go to the village to live he won't be visiting me all the time!\"  Another thing the older brothers couldn't understand about Stefan was why he was always laughing and joking. He did the work of two men but whether he was working or resting you could always hear him cracking his merry jokes and laughing his jolly laugh.  \"I think he's foolish!\" Mihailo said.  Jakov hoped that the village people wouldn't hear about his carryings on.  \"They'd laugh at him,\" he said, \"and they'd laugh at us, too, because we're his brothers.\"  But Stefan didn't care. The more they frowned at him, the louder he laughed, and in spite of their dark looks he kept on cracking his merry jokes and talking nonsense. And every evening after supper his little sister, Militza, clapped her hands and cried:  \"Now, Stefan, tell me a story! Tell me a story!\"  \"Father,\" Mihailo would say, \"you ought to make him keep quiet! He's foolish and all he does is fill Militza's head with nonsense!\"  This always made Militza very indignant and she would stamp her little foot and say:  \"He isn't foolish! He knows more than any one! And he can do more things than any one else and he's the handsomest brother in the world!\"  You see Militza loved Stefan dearly and when you love a person of course you think that person is wonderful. But the father supposed that Mihailo must be right for Mihailo studied in books. So he shook his head and sighed every time he thought of Stefan.  Now the kingdom in which the three brothers lived was ruled over by a great Tsar who had an only daughter. In disappointment that he had no son, the Tsar was having his daughter brought up as though she were a boy. He sent all over the world for tutors and teachers and had the poor girl taught statecraft and law and philosophy and all the other things"]]]
