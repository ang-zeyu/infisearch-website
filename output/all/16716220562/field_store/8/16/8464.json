No class of articles of textile nature were more universally employed by the aborigines than mats of split cane, rushes, and reeds, and our information, derived from literature and from such remnants of the articles themselves as have been recovered from graves and caves, is quite full and satisfactory. Mats are not so varied in form and character as are baskets, but their uses were greatly diversified; they served for carpeting, seats, hangings, coverings, and wrappings, and they were extensively employed in permanent house construction, and for temporary or movable shelters. A few brief extracts will serve to indicate their use in various classes of construction by the tribes first encountered by the whites.  Hariot says that the houses of the Virginia Indians--      Are made of small poles made fast at the tops in rounde forme     after the maner as is vsed in many arbories in our gardens of     England, in most townes couered with barkes, and in some with     artificiall mattes made of long rushes; from the tops of the     houses downe to the ground.[17]  [Illustration: PL. I. PRODUCTS OF THE TEXTILE ART.  _a_, Openwork fish baskets of Virginia Indians; _b_, manner of weaving; _c_, basket strainer; _d_, quiver of rushes; _e_, mat of rushes.]  It would appear from a study of the numerous illustrations of houses given by this author that the mats so often referred to were identical in construction with those still in use among the tribes of the upper Mississippi and the far west. The rushes are laid close together side by side and bound together at long intervals by cords intertwined across. In _e_, plate I, is reproduced a small portion of a mat from Hariot's engraving of the dead-house of the Virginia Indians, which shows this method of construction.  The modern use of mats of this class in house construction is known by an example which I have seen represented in a small photograph, taken about the year 1868, and representing a Chippewa village, situated somewhere in the upper Missouri valley, probably not far from Sioux City, Iowa.  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Use of mats in an Indian council (after Lafitau).]  Mats were used not only in and about the dwellings of the aborigines, but it was a common practice to carry them from place to place to sleep on, or for use as seats or carpeting in meetings or councils of ceremonious nature. The latter use is illustrated in a number of the early accounts of the natives. Figure 2, copied from Lafitau, serves to indicate the common practice.  The omnipresent sweat-house of the aborigines is thus described by Smith:      Sometimes they are troubled with dropsies, swellings, aches,     and such like diseases; for cure whereof they build a Stone     in the forme of a Doue-house with mats, so close that a few     coales therein covered with a pot, will make the patient     sweat extreamely.[18]  Bartram, speaking of the Seminoles, states that the wide steps leading up to the canopied platform of the council house are \"covered with carpets or mats, curiously woven of split canes dyed of various colours.\"[19]  The use of mats in the mound country in very early times is described by Joutel as follows:      Their moveables are some bullocks' hides and goat skins well     cured, some mats close wove, wherewith they adorn their huts,     and some earthen vessels which they are very skilful at     making, and wherein they boil their flesh or roots, or     sagamisé, which, as has been said, is their pottage. They     have also some small baskets made of canes, serving to put in     their fruit and other provisions. Their beds are made of     canes, raised 2 or 3 feet above the ground, handsomely fitted     with mats and bullocks' hides, or goat skins well cured,     which serve them for feather beds, or quilts and blankets;     and those beds are parted one from another by mats hung     up.[20]  The mats so much used for beds and carpets and for the covering of shelters, houses, etc., were probably made of pliable materials such as rushes. De la Potherie illustrates their use as beds,[21] one end of the mat being rolled up for a pillow as shown in figure 3.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Use of mat in sleeping (after De la Potherie).]  The sizes of mats were greatly varied; the smallest were sufficient for seating only a single person, but the largest were many yards in length, the width being restricted to a few feet by the conditions of construction.  Mats were woven in two or more styles. Where the strands or parts were uniform in size and rigidity they were simply interlaced, but when one strong or rigid series was to be kept in place by a pliable series, the latter were twisted about the former at the intersections as in ordinary twined weaving. The heavy series of strands or parts were held together side by side by the intertwined strands placed far apart, a common practice yet among native mat-makers. Much variety of character and appearance was given to the fabric by varying the order of the strands in intersection. It was a common practice to interweave strands of different size, shape, or color, thus producing borders and patterns of no little beauty. Du Pratz thus mentions the use of dyes by the Louisiana Indians: \"The women sometimes add to this furniture of the bed mats woven of cane, dyed of 3 colours, which colours in the weaving are formed into various figures.\"[22] This is well illustrated in the mat from a rock shelter in Tennessee, later to be described, and the Indians of the east and north practiced the same art.  Speaking of the ceremony of smoking the calumet among the Iroquois, De la Potherie says:      The ceremony is held in a large cabin in winter and in summer     in an open field. The place being chosen, it is surrounded     with branches to shade the company. In the center is spread a     large mat of canes dyed in various colors, which serves as a     carpet.[23]  Frequent mention is made of the use of mats in burial. Two brief extracts will serve to illustrate this use. Butel-Dumont makes the following statement regarding tribes of the lower Mississippi:      The Paskagoulas and Billoxis do not inter their chief when he     dies, but they dry the corpse with fire and smoke in such a     way that it becomes a mere skeleton. After it is reduced to     this state they carry it to the temple (for they have one as     well as the Natchez) and put it in the place of its     predecessor, which they take from the spot it occupied and     place it with the bodies of the other chiefs at the bottom of     the temple, where they are arranged one after the other,     standing upright like statues. As for the newly deceased, he     is exposed at the entrance of the temple on a sort of altar     or table made of cane and covered with a fine mat very neatly     worked in red and yellow squares with the skin of the     canes.[24]  Brackenridge[25] says that a few years ago, in the state of Tennessee, \"Two human bodies were found in a copperas cave in a surprising state of preservation. They were first wrapped up in a kind of blanket, supposed to have been manufactured of the lint of nettles, afterwards with dressed skins, and then a mat of nearly 60 yards in length.\"     [17] A Brief and True account of the New Found Land of    Virginia, Thomas Hariot, p. 24.

The use of simple strands or parts in textile art precedes the use of spun threads, but the one use leads very naturally up to the other. In employing rushes, stems, grasses, etc., the smaller strands were doubled to secure uniformity of size, and when a number of parts were used they were combined into one by twisting or plaiting. In time the advantage in strength and pliability of twisted strands came to be recognized, and this led to the general utilization of fibrous substances, and finally to the manufacture of suitable fibers by manipulating the bark of trees and plants. Spinning was probably not devised until the weaver's art had made considerable advance, but its invention opened a new and broad field and led to the development of a magnificent industry. Semi-rigid fabrics served for a wide range of uses, as already described, but soft and pliable cloths for personal use and ornament were made possible only by the introduction of spinning.  On the arrival of the whites the native art was well advanced; thread, cordage, and even ropes of considerable weight were made with a degree of uniformity and refinement that surprises us. The finest threads with which I am acquainted are perhaps not as fine as our no. 10 ordinary spool cotton thread, but we are not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19921"],["title","Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States (#4)"],["body","in assuming that more refined work was not done. What we have is only that which happened to be preserved through burial with the dead or by impression on the plastic surface of clay used in the arts.  The materials employed for spinning by the aborigines were greatly diversified. Through historical as well as through purely archeologic sources we learn that both vegetal and animal filaments and fibers were freely used. The inner bark of the mulberry was a favorite material, but other fibrous barks were utilized. Wild hemp, nettles, grasses, and other like growths furnished much of the finer fibers. The hackling was accomplished by means of the simplest devices, such as pounding with hammers or sticks. The hair and sinews of animals were frequently spun into threads and woven into cloth.  A few citations from early authors will indicate sufficiently for present purposes the methods of spinning and weaving employed by tribes which, if not in all cases mound-builders, were at least the neighbors and relatives of the mound-building Indians.   CLOTHS.  The character of the woven articles is to a great extent indicated in the extracts which follow. It evidently was not customary to weave \"piece\" goods, but rather to make separate units of costumes, furnishing, etc., for use without cutting, fitting, and sewing. Each piece was practically complete when it came from the frame or loom. For clothing and personal use there were mantles, shawls, and cloaks to be worn over one or both shoulders or about the body as described by Hariot, Smith, the Knight of Elvas, Du Pratz, and others; there were skirts fastened about the waist and drawn with an inserted cord or looped over a belt; there were belts, sashes, garters, shot pouches, and bags. For household use there were hangings, covers for various articles, and bedclothing; there were nets for fishing and cords for angling. Some of these extracts describe the whole group of activities included in the practice of the art as well as the use of the products. I have considered it preferable to quote as a unit all that is said on the subject by each author, giving cross reference, when necessary, in discussing particular topics under other headings.  Weaving among the Indians of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and the northeast is described by Kalm, De la Potherie, and others. The following extracts are from Kalm, and will serve to indicate the status of the art over a wide area:      _Apocynum cannabinum_ was by the Swedes called Hemp of the     Indians; and grew plentifully in old corn grounds, in woods on     hills, and in high glades. The Swedes had given it the name of     Indian hemp, because the Indians formerly, and even now, apply     it to the same purposes as the Europeans do hemp; for the     stalk may be divided into filaments, and is easily prepared.     When the Indians were yet settled among the Swedes, in     Pensylvania and New Jersey, they made ropes of this apocynum,     which the Swedes bought, and employed them as bridles, and for     nets. These ropes were stronger, and kept longer in water,     than such as were made of common hemp. The Swedes commonly got     fourteen yards of these ropes for one piece of bread. Many of     the Europeans still buy such ropes, because they last so well.     The Indians likewise make several other stuffs of their hemp.     On my journey through the country of the Iroquese, I saw the     women employed in manufacturing this hemp. They made use     neither of spinning wheels nor distaffs, but rolled the     filaments upon their bare thighs, and made thread and strings     of them, which they dyed red, yellow, black, etc., and     afterwards worked them into stuffs, with a great deal of     ingenuity. The plant is perennial, which renders the annual     planting of it altogether unnecessary. Out of the root and     stalk of this plant, when it is fresh, comes a white milky     juice, which is somewhat poisonous. Sometimes the fishing     tackle of the Indians consists entirely of this hemp. The     Europeans make no use of it, that I know of.[26]  In another place this author describes the weaving of bark fibers:      The _Direa palustris_, or Mouse-wood, is a little shrub which     grows on hills, towards swamps and marshes, and was now in     full blossom. The English in Albany call it Leather-wood,     because its bark is as tough as leather. The French in Canada     call it Bois de Plomb, or Leaden-wood because the wood itself     is as soft and as tough as lead. The bark of this shrub was     made use of for ropes, baskets, etc., by the Indians, whilst     they lived among the Swedes. And it is really very fit for     that purpose, on account of its remarkable strength, and     toughness, which is equal to that of the Lime-tree bark. The     English and the Dutch in many parts of North America, and the     French in Canada, employ this bark in all cases where we make     use of Lime-tree bark in Europe. The tree itself is very     tough, and you cannot easily separate its branches without     the help of a knife: some people employ the twigs for     rods.[27]  De la Potherie, who wrote at an earlier date than Kalm, says--      The women spin on their knees, twisting the thread with the     palm of the hand; they make this thread, which should rather     be called twine (fisselle), into little balls.[28]  Hariot, John Smith, and Adair bear witness to the primitive practice of the art in Virginia and the Carolinas. Smith uses the following words:       Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin,      the barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kinde of grasse      they call Pemmenaw, of these they make a thread very even      and readily. This thread serveth for many vses. As about      their housing apparell, as also they make nets for fishing,      for the quantitie as formally as ours. They make also with      it lines for angles.[29]  The Cherokees and other Indians with whom Adair came in contact preserved in their purity many of the ancient practices. The following extracts are, therefore, of much importance to the historian of the textile art in America:      Formerly, the Indians made very handsome carpets. They have a     wild hemp that grows about six feet high, in open, rich,     level lands, and which usually ripens in July: it is plenty     on our frontier settlements. When it is fit for use, they     pull, steep, peel, and beat it; and the old women spin it off     the distaffs, with wooden machines, having some clay on the     middle of them, to hasten the motion. When the coarse thread     is prepared, they put it into a frame about six feet square,     and instead of a shuttle, they thrust through the thread with     a long cane, having a large string through the web, which     they shift at every second course of the thread. When they     have thus finished their arduous labour, they paint each side     of the carpet with such figures, of various colours, as their     fruitful imaginations devise; particularly the images of     those birds and beasts they are acquainted with; and likewise     of themselves, acting in their social, and martial stations.     There is that due proportion and so much wild variety in the     design, that would really strike a curious eye with pleasure     and admiration. J. W--t, Esq., a most skilful linguist in the     Muskohge dialect, assures me, that time out of mind they     passed the woof with a shuttle; and they have a couple of     threddles, which they move with the hand so as to enable them     to make good dispatch, something after our manner of weaving.     This is sufficiently confirmed by their method of working     broad garters, sashes, shot pouches, broad belts, and the     like, which are decorated all over with beautiful stripes and     chequers.      The women are the chief, if not the only, manufacturers; the     men judge that if they performed that office, it would     exceedingly depreciate them. * * * In the winter season, the     women gather buffalo's hair, a sort of coarse, brown, curled     wool; and having spun it as fine as they can, and properly     doubled it, they put small beads of different colours upon     the yarn, as they work it, the figures they work in those     small webs, are generally uniform, but sometimes they     diversify them on both sides. The Choktah weave shot-pouches     which have raised work inside and outside. They likewise make     turkey feather blankets with the long feathers of the neck     and breast of that large fowl--they twist the inner end of     the feathers very fast into a strong double thread of hemp,     or the inner bark of the mulberry tree, of the size and     strength of coarse twine, as the fibres are sufficiently     fine, and they work it in manner of fine netting. As the     feathers are long and glittering, this sort of blankets is     not only very warm, but pleasing to the eye.[30]  The extent and importance of the art among the Gulf tribes are indicated by a number of early observers. The Knight of Elvas speaks of the use of blankets by the Indians, 83 degrees west longitude, and 32 degrees north latitude, or near the central portion of Georgia:      These are like shawls, some of them are made from the inner     barks of trees, and others from a grass resembling nettle,     which, by threading out, becomes like flax. The women use     them for covering, wearing one about the body from the waist     downward, and another over the shoulder, with the right arm     left free, after the manner of the gypsies: the men wear but     one, which they carry over their shoulders in the same way,     the loins being covered with a bragueiro of deer-skin, after     the fashion of the woolen breech-cloth that was once the     custom of Spain. The skins are well dressed, the color being     given to them that is wished, and in such perfection, that,     when of vermilion, they look"]]]
