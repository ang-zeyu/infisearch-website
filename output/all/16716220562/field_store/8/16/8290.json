Some people have the faculty of unconsciously formulating principles from their everyday observations, but it is a slow process, and many never acquire it unless it is taught them.  The spelling problem is not to learn how to spell nine tenths of our words correctly.  Nearly all of us can and do accomplish that. The good speller must spell nine hundred and ninety-nine one thousandths of his word correctly, which is quite another matter. Some of us go even one figure higher.  Our first task is clearly to commit the common irregular words to memory. How may we do that most easily?  It is a huge task at best, but every pound of life energy which we can save in doing it is so much gained for higher efforts.  We should strive to economize effort in this just as the manufacturer tries to economize in the cost of making his goods.  In this particular matter, it seems to the present writer that makers of modern spelling-books have committed a great blunder in mixing indiscriminately regular words with irregular, and common words with uncommon.  Clearly we should memorize first the words we use most often, and then take up those which we use less frequently.  But the superintendent of the Evanston schools has reported that out of one hundred first-reader words which he gave to his grammar classes as a spelling test, some were misspelled by all but sixteen per cent{.} of the pupils.  And yet these same pupils were studying busily away on _categories, concatenation,_ and _amphibious_.  The spelling-book makers feel that they must put hard words into their spellers.  Their books are little more than lists of words, and any one can make lists of common, easy words.  A spelling-book filled with common easy words would not seem to be worth the price paid for it.  Pupils and teachers must get their money's worth, even if they never learn to spell.  Of course the teachers are expected to furnish drills themselves on the common, easy words; but unfortunately they take their cue from the spelling-book, each day merely assigning to the class the next page.  They haven't time to select, and no one could consistently expect them to do otherwise than as they do do.  To meet this difficulty, the author of this book has prepared a version of the story of Robinson Crusoe which contains a large proportion of the common words which offer difficulty in spelling.  Unluckily it is not easy to produce classic English when one is writing under the necessity of using a vocabulary previously selected.  However, if we concentrate our attention on the word-forms, we are not likely to be much injured by the ungraceful sentence-forms.  This story is not long, but it should be dictated to every school class, beginning in the fourth grade, until _every_ pupil can spell _every_ word correctly. A high percentage is not enough, as in the case of some other studies. Any pupil who misses a single word in any exercise should be marked zero.  But even if one can spell correctly every word in this story, he may still not be a good speller, for there are thousands of other words to be spelled, many of which are not and never will be found in any spelling-book.  The chief object of a course of study in spelling is to acquire two habits, the habit of observing articulate sounds, and the habit of observing word-forms in reading.  1.  Train the Ear.  Until the habit of observing articulate sounds carefully has been acquired, the niceties of pronunciation are beyond the student's reach, and equally the niceties of spelling are beyond his reach, too.  In ordinary speaking, many vowels and even some consonants are slurred and obscured.  If the ear is not trained to exactness, this habit of slurring introduces many inaccuracies.  Even in careful speaking, many obscure sounds are so nearly alike that only a finely trained ear can detect any difference.  Who of us notices any difference between _er_ in _pardoner_ and _or_ in _honor_?  Careful speakers do not pass over the latter syllable quite so hastily as over the former, but only the most finely trained ear will detect any difference even in the pronunciation of the most finely trained voice.  In the lower grades in the schools the ear may be trained by giving separate utterance to each sound in a given word, as f-r-e-n-d, _friend,_ allowing each letter only its true value in the word.  Still it may also be obtained by requiring careful and distinct pronunciation in reading, not, however, to the extent of exaggerating the value of obscure syllables, or painfully accentuating syllables naturally obscure.  Adults (but seldom children) may train the ear by reading poetry aloud, always guarding against the sing-song style, but trying to harmonize nicely the sense and the rhythm.  A trained ear is absolutely necessary to reading poetry well, and the constant reading aloud of poetry cannot but afford an admirable exercise.  For children, the use of diacritical marks has little or no value, until the necessity arises for consulting the dictionary for pronunciation. They are but a mechanical system, and the system we commonly use is so devoid of permanence in its character that every dictionary has a different system.  The one most common in the schools is that introduced by Webster; but if we would consult the Standard or the Century or the Oxford, we must learn our system all over again.  To the child, any system is a clog and a hindrance, and quite useless in teaching him phonetic values, wherein the voice of the teacher is the true medium.  For older students, however, especially students at home, where no teacher is available, phonetic writing by means of diacritical marks has great value.*  It is the only practicable way of representing the sounds of the voice on paper.  When the student writes phonetically he is obliged to observe closely his own voice and the voices of others in ordinary speech, and so his ear is trained.  It also takes the place of the voice for dictation in spelling tests by mail or through the medium of books.   *There should be no more marks than there are sounds.  When two vowels have the same sound one should be written as a substitute for the other, as we have done in this book.  2.  Train the Eye.  No doubt the most effective way of learning spelling is to train the eye carefully to observe the forms of the words we read in newspapers and in books.  If this habit is formed, and the habit of general reading accompanies it, it is sufficient to make a nearly perfect speller.  The great question is, how to acquire it.  Of course in order to read we are obliged to observe the forms of words in a general way, and if this were all that is needed, we should all be good spellers if we were able to read fluently.  But it is not all. The observation of the general form of a word is not the observation that teaches spelling.  We must have the habit of observing every letter in every word, and this we are not likely to have unless we give special attention to acquiring it.  The “visualization” method of teaching spelling now in use in the schools is along the line of training the eye to observe every letter in a word.  It is good so far as it goes; but it does not go very far. The reason is that there is a limit to the powers of the memory, especially in the observation of arbitrary combinations of letters. What habits of visualization would enable the ordinary person to glance at such a combination as the following and write it ten minutes afterward with no aid but the single glance: _hwgufhtbizwskoplmne?_ It would require some minutes' study to memorize such a combination, because there is nothing to aid us but the sheer succession of forms. The memory works by association.  We build up a vast structure of knowledge, and each new fact or form must be as securely attached to this as the new wing of a building; and the more points at which attachment can be formed the more easily is the addition made.  The Mastery of Irregular Words.  Here, then, we have the real reason for a long study of principles, analogies, and classifications.  They help us to remember.  If I come to the word _colonnade_ in reading, I observe at once that the double _n_ is an irregularity.  It catches my eye immediately.  “Ah!” I reflect almost in the fraction of a second as I read in continuous flow, “here is another of those exceptions.”  Building on what I already know perfectly well, I master this word with the very slightest effort.  If we can build up a system which will serve the memory by way of association, so that the slight effort that can be given in ordinary reading will serve to fix a word more or less fully, we can soon acquire a marvellous power in the accurate spelling of words.  Again: In a spelling-book before me I see lists of words ending in _ise, ize,_ and _yse,_ all mixed together with no distinction.  The arrangement suggests memorizing every word in the language ending with either of these terminations, and until we have memorized any particular word we have no means of knowing what the termination is.  If, however, we are taught that _ize_ is the common ending, that _ise_ is the ending of only thirty-one words, and _yse_ of only three or four, we reduce our task enormously and aid the memory in acquiring the few exceptions.  When we come to _franchise_ in reading we reflect rapidly, “Another of those verbs in _ise_!” or to _paralyse,_ “One of those very few verbs in _yse_!”  We give no thought whatever to all the verbs ending in _ize,_ and so save so much energy for other acquirements.  If we can say, “This is a violation of such and such a rule,” or “This is a strange irregularity,” or “This belongs to the class of words which substitutes _ea_ for the long sound of _e,_ or for the short sound of _e_.”  We have an association of the unknown with the known that is the most powerful possible aid to the memory.  The system may fail in and of itself, but it more than serves its purpose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],["title","The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#3)"],["body"," indirectly in aiding the memory.  We have not spoken of the association of word forms with sounds, the grouping of the letters of words into syllables, and the aid that a careful pronunciation gives the memory by way of association; for while this is the most powerful aid of all, it does not need explanation.  The Mastery of Regular Words.  We have spoken of the mastery of irregular words, and in the last paragraph but one we have referred to the aid which general principles give the memory by way of association in acquiring the exceptions to the rules. We will now consider the great class of words formed according to fixed principles.  Of course these laws and rules are little more than a string of analogies which we observe in our study of the language.  The language was not and never will be built to fit these rules.  The usage of the people is the only authority.  Even clear logic goes down before usage.  Languages grow like mushrooms, or lilies, or bears, or human bodies.  Like these they have occult and profound laws which we can never hope to penetrate,―which are known only to the creator of all things existent.  But as in botany and zoölogy and physiology we may observe and classify our observations, so we may observe a language, classify our observations, and create an empirical science of word-formation.  Possibly in time it will become a science something more than empirical.  The laws we are able at this time to state with much definiteness are few (doubling consonants, dropping silent e's, changing y's to i's, accenting the penultimate and antepenultimate syllables, lengthening and shortening vowels).  In addition we may classify exceptions, for the sole purpose of aiding the memory.  Ignorance of these principles and classifications, and knowledge of the causes and sources of the irregularities, should be pronounced criminal in a teacher; and failure to teach them, more than criminal in a spelling-book.  It is true that most spelling-books do give them in one form or another, but invariably without due emphasis or special drill, a lack which renders them worthless.  Pupils and students should be drilled upon them till they are as familiar as the multiplication table.  We know how most persons stumble over the pronunciation of names in the Bible and in classic authors.  They are equally nonplussed when called upon to write words with which they are no more familiar.  They cannot even pronounce simple English names like _Cody,_ which they call “Coddy,” in analogy with _body,_ because they do not know that in a word of two syllables a single vowel followed by a single consonant is regularly long when accented.  At the same time they will spell the word in all kinds of queer ways, which are in analogy only with exceptions, not with regular formations.  Unless a person knows what the regular principles are, he cannot know how a word should regularly be spelled. A strange word is spelled quite regularly nine times out of ten, and if one does not know exactly how to spell a word, it is much more to his credit to spell it in a regular way than in an irregular way.  The truth is, the only possible key we can have to those thousands of strange words and proper names which we meet only once or twice in a lifetime, is the system of principles formulated by philologists, if for no other reason, we should master it that we may come as near as possible to spelling proper names correctly.   CHAPTER I.  LETTERS AND SOUNDS.  We must begin our study of the English language with the elementary sounds and the letters which represent them.  Name the first letter of the alphabet——_a_.  The mouth is open and the sound may be prolonged indefinitely.  It is a full, clear sound, an unobstructed vibration of the vocal chords.  Now name the second letter of the alphabet——_b_.  You say _bee_ or _buh_. You cannot prolong the sound.  In order to give the real sound of _b_ you have to associate it with some other sound, as that of _e_ or _u_. In other words, _b_ is in the nature of an obstruction of sound, or a modification of sound, rather than a simple elementary sound in itself. There is indeed a slight sound in the throat, but it is a closed sound and cannot be prolonged.  In the case of _p,_ which is similar to _b,_ there is no sound from the throat.  So we see that there are two classes of sounds (represented by two classes of letters), those which are full and open tones from the vocal chords, pronounced with the mouth open, and capable of being prolonged indefinitely; and those which are in the nature of modifications of these open sounds, pronounced with or without the help of the voice, and incapable of being prolonged.  The first class of sounds is called vowel sounds, the second, consonant sounds.  Of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, _a, e, i, o,_ and _u_ (sometimes _y_ and _w_) represent vowel sounds and are called vowels; and the remainder represent consonant sounds, and are called consonants.  A syllable is an elementary sound, or a combination of elementary sounds, which can be given easy and distinct utterance at one effort. Any vowel may form a syllable by itself, but as we have seen that a consonant must be united with a vowel for its perfect utterance, it follows that every syllable must contain a vowel sound, even if it also contains consonant sounds.  With that vowel sound one or more consonants may be united; but the ways in which consonants may combine with a vowel to form a syllable are limited.  In general we may place any consonant before and any consonant after the vowel in the same syllable: but _y_ for instance, can be given a consonant sound only at the beginning of a syllable, as in _yet_; at the end of a syllable _y_ becomes a vowel sound, as in _they_ or _only_. In the syllable _twelfths_ we find seven consonant sounds; but if these same letters were arranged in almost any other way they could not be pronounced as one syllable―as for instance _wtelthfs_.  A word consists of one or more syllables to which some definite meaning is attached.  The difficulties of spelling and pronunciation arise largely from the fact that in English twenty-six letters must do duty for some forty-two sounds, and even then several of the letters are unnecessary, as for instance _c,_ which has either the sound of _s_ or of _k_; _x,_ which has the sound either of _ks, gs,_ or _z_; _q,_ which in the combination _qu_ has the sound of _kw_.  All the vowels represent from two to seven sounds each, and some of the consonants interchange with each other.  The Sounds of the Vowels.―(1)  Each of the vowels has what is called a long sound and a short sound.  It is important that these two sets of sounds be fixed clearly in the mind, as several necessary rules of spelling depend upon them.  In studying the following table, note that the long sound is marked by a straight line over the letter, and the short sound by a curve.  _Long       Short_   āte         ăt   gāve        măn   nāme        băg    thēse       pĕt   mē          tĕn   (com)plēte  brĕd    kīte        sĭt   rīce        mĭll   līme        rĭp    nōte        nŏt   rōde        rŏd   sōle        Tŏm    cūre        bŭt   cūte        rŭn   (a)būse     crŭst    scұthe      (like)lў  If we observe the foregoing list of words we shall see that each of the words containing a long vowel followed by a single consonant sound ends in silent _e_.  After the short vowels there is no silent _e_. In each case in which we have the silent _e_ there is a single long vowel followed by a single consonant, or two consonants combining to form a single sound, as _th_ in _scythe_.  Such words as _roll, toll,_ etc., ending in double _l_ have no silent _e_ though the vowel is long; and such words as _great, meet, pail,_ etc., in which two vowels combine with the sound of one, take no silent _e_ at the end. We shall consider these exceptions more fully later; but a _single long_ vowel followed by a _single_ consonant _always_ takes silent _e_ at the end.  As carefully stated in this way, the rule has no exceptions. The reverse, however, is not always true, for a few words containing a short vowel followed by a single consonant do take silent _e_; but there are very few of them.  The principal are _have, give,_ {(I)} _live, love, shove, dove, above;_ also _none, some, come,_ and some words in three or more syllables, such as _domicile_.  2.  Beside the long and short sounds of the vowels there are several other vowel sounds.  A has two other distinct sounds:  ̣ạ broad, like _aw,_ as in _all, talk,_ etc.  ä Italian, like _ah,_ as in _far, father,_ etc.  Double o has two sounds different from long or short _o_ alone:  long ōō as in _room, soon, mood,_ etc.  short ŏŏ, as in _good, took, wood,_ etc.  Ow has a sound of its own, as in _how, crowd, allow,_ etc.; and _ou_ sometimes has the same sound, as in _loud, rout, bough,_ etc.  (_Ow_ and _ou_ are also sometimes sounded like long _o,_ as in _own, crow, pour,_ etc., and sometimes have still other sounds, as _ou_ in _bought_).  Oi and oy have a distinct sound of their own, as in _oil, toil, oyster, void, boy, employ,_ etc.  _Ow_ and _oi_ are called proper diphthongs, as the two vowels combine to produce a sound different from either, while such combinations as _ei, ea, ai,_ etc., are called improper diphthongs (or digraphs), because they have the sound of one or other of the simple vowels.  3.  In the preceding paragraphs we have given all the distinct vowel sounds of the language, though many of them are slightly modified in certain combinations.  But in many cases one vowel will be given the sound of another vowel, and two or more vowels will combine with a variety of sounds.  These irregularities occur chiefly in a few hundred common words, and cause the main difficulties of spelling the English language.  The following are the leading substitutes:  ew with the sound of _u_ long, as in _few, chew,_ etc. (perhaps this may be considered a"]]]
