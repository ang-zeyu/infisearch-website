[Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     THE LITTLE LONDON GIRL.     In my little Green House, quite content am I,   When the hot sun pours down from the sky;   For oh, I love the country--the beautiful country.   Who'd live in a London street when there's the country?    I live in a London street, then I long and long   To be the whole day the sweet Flowers among   Instead of tall chimney-pots up in the sky,   The joy of seeing Birds and Dragon Flies go by.    At home I lie in bed, and cannot go to sleep,   For the sound of cart-wheels upon the hard street.   But here my eyes close up to no sound of anything   Except it is to hear the nightingales sing.    And then I see the Chickens and the Geese go walking,   I hear the Pigs and the Ducks all talking.   And the Red and the Spotted Cows they stare at me,   As if they wondered whoever I could be.    I see the little Lambs out with their mothers--   Such pretty little white young sisters and brothers.   Oh, I'll stay in the country, and make a daisy chain,   And never go back to London again.  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     TO BABY.     Oh, what shall my blue eyes go see?     Shall it be pretty Quack-Quack to-day?   Or the Peacock upon the Yew Tree?     Or the dear little white Lambs at play?             Say Baby.   For Baby is such a young Petsy,     And Baby is such a sweet Dear.   And Baby is growing quite old now--     She's just getting on for a year.         =================================  [Illustration]     WILLY AND HIS SISTER.     Willy said to his sister,     \"Please may I go with you?\"   She said, \"You must behave     Very nicely if you do.\"    \"Please will you take me then     To look at the mill?\"   \"Yes,\" she said, \"because you are     So very good--I will.\"    \"The miller he is     So very white and kind;   And sprinkled all over     With the flour they grind.    \"And the big heaps of corn     That lie upon the floor;   He will let me play with those     I am quite sure.    \"I like to hear the wheel     Make such a rushing sound,   And see the pretty water     Go round, and round, and round.    \"So take me to the mill,     For then you shall see   What a very, very good boy     I really mean to be.\"  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     AT SCHOOL.     Five little Girls, sitting on a form,   Five little Girls, with lessons to learn,   Five little Girls, who, I'm afraid,   Won't know them a bit when they have to be said.    For little eyes are given to look   Anywhere else than on their book;   And little thoughts are given to stray   Anywhere--ever so far away.         =================================  [Illustration]     HAPPY DAYS.     \"Are you going next week to see Phillis and Phoebe?     Phillis on Monday will be just fourteen.   She says we shall all have our tea in the garden,     And afterwards have some nice games on the green.    \"I wanted a new frock, but mother said, 'No,'     So I must be content with my old one you see.   But then white is so pretty, and kind Aunt Matilda     Has sent down a beautiful necklace for me.\"  [Illustration]    \"Oh, yes, I am going, and Peggy is going,     And mother is making us new frocks to wear;   I shall have my red sash and my hat with pink ribbons--     I know all the girls will be smart who are there.    \"And then, too, we're going to each take a nosegay--     The larger the better--for Phillis to say   That all her friends love her, and wish her so happy,     And bring her sweet flowers upon her birthday.    \"And won't it be lovely, in beautiful sunshine,     The table spread under the great apple tree,   To see little Phillis--that dear little Phillis--     Look smiling all round as she pours out the tea!\"         =================================  [Illustration]     THE LITTLE QUEEN'S COMING.         With Roses--red Roses,       We'll pelt her with Roses,   And Lilies--white Lilies we'll drop at her feet;       The little Queen's coming,       The people are running--   The people are running to greet and to meet.        Then clash out a welcome,       Let all the bells sound, come,   To give her a welcoming proud and sweet.       How her blue eyes will beam,       And her golden curls gleam,   When the sound of our singing rings down the street.         =================================  [Illustration]     ON THE WALL TOP.     Dancing and prancing to town we go,   On the top of the wall of the town we go.   Shall we talk to the stars, or talk to the moon,   Or run along home to our dinner so soon?         =================================  [Illustration]     ON THE WALL TOP.     So high--so high on the wall we run,   The nearer the sky--why, the nearer the sun,   If you give me one penny, I'll give you two,   For that's the way good neighbours do.         =================================  [Illustration]     TIP-A-TOE.     Tip-a-Toe,   See them go;   One, two, three--   Chloe, Prue, and me;   Up and down,   To the town.   A Lord was there,   And the Lady fair.   And what did they sing?   Oh, \"Ring-a-ding-ding;\"   And the Black Crow flew off   With the Lady's Ring.         =================================  [Illustration]     MAMMAS AND BABIES.     \"My Polly is so very good,     Belinda never cries;   My Baby often goes to sleep,     See how she shuts her eyes.    \"Dear Mrs. Lemon tell me when     Belinda goes to school;   And what time does she go to bed?\"     \"Well, eight o'clock's the rule.    \"But now and then, just for a treat,     I let her wait awhile;   You shake your head--why, wouldn't you?     Do look at Baby's smile!\"  [Illustration]    \"Dear Mrs. Primrose will you come     One day next week to tea?   Of course bring Rosalinda, and     That darling--Rosalie.\"    \"Dear Mrs. Cowslip, you _are_ kind;     My little folks, I know,   Will be so very pleased to come;     Dears--tell Mrs. Cowslip so.    \"Oh, do you know--perhaps you've not heard--     She had a dreadful fright;   My Daisy with the measles     Kept me up every night.    \"And then I've been so worried--     Clarissa had a fit;   And the doctor said he couldn't     In the least account for it.\"  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     MY LITTLE GIRLIE.     Little girlie tell to me   What your wistful blue eyes see?   Why you like to stand so high,   Looking at the far off sky.    Does a tiny Fairy flit   In the pretty blue of it?   Or is it that you hope so soon   To see the rising yellow Moon?    Or is it--as I think I've heard--   You're looking for a little Bird   To come and sit upon a spray,   And sing the summer night away?         =================================  [Illustration]     THE CATS HAVE COME TO TEA.     What did she see--oh, what did she see,   As she stood leaning against the tree?   Why all the Cats had come to tea.    What a fine turn out--from round about,   All the houses had let them out,   And here they were with scamper and shout.    \"Mew--mew--mew!\" was all they could say,   And, \"We hope we find you well to-day.\"    Oh, what should she do--oh, what should she do?   What a lot of milk they would get through;   For here they were with \"Mew--mew--mew!\"    She didn't know--oh, she didn't know,   If bread and butter they'd like or no;   They might want little mice, oh! oh! oh!    Dear me--oh, dear me,   All the cats had come to tea.         =================================  [Illustration]     THE TEA PARTY.     In the pleasant green Garden     We sat down to tea;   \"Do you take sugar?\" and     \"Do you take milk?\"   She'd got a new gown on--     A smart one of silk.   We all were so happy     As happy could be,   On that bright Summer's day     When she asked us to tea.  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     UNDER ROSE ARCHES.     Under Rose Arches to Rose Town--     Rose Town on the top of the hill;   For the Summer wind blows and music goes,     And the violins sound shrill.    Twist and twine Roses and Lilies,     And little leaves green,     Fit for a queen;   Twist and twine Roses and Lilies.    Oh, Roses shall be for her carpet,     And her curtains of Roses so fair;   And a Rosy crown, while far adown     Floats her long golden hair.    Twist and twine Roses and Lilies,     And all the bells ring,     And all the people sing;   Twist and twine Roses and Lilies.         =================================  [Illustration]     A GENTEEL FAMILY.     Some children are so naughty,     And some are very good;   But the Genteel Family     Did always what it should.    They put on gloves when they went out,     And ran not in the street;   And on wet days not one of them     Had ever muddy feet.    Then they were always so polite,     And always thanked you so;   And never threw their toys about,     As naughty children do.    They always learnt their lessons     When it was time they should;   And liked to eat up all their crusts--     They were so very good.    And then their frocks were never torn,     Their tuckers always clean;   And their hair so very tidy--     Always quite fit to be seen.    Then they made calls with their mamma     And were so very neat;   And learnt to bow becomingly     When they met you in the street.    And really they were everything     That children ought to be;   And well may be examples now     For little you--and me.  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     BABY MINE.     Baby mine, over the trees;     Baby mine, over the flowers;   Baby mine, over the sunshine;     Baby mine, over the showers.    Baby mine, over the land;     Baby mine, over the water.   Oh, when had a mother before     Such a sweet--such a sweet, little daughter!         =================================  [Illustration]     LITTLE"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19541"],["title","Marigold Garden (#2)"],["body","AND LITTLE LAMBS.     In the May-time flowers grow;   Little girls in meadows go;   Little lambs frisk with delight,   And in the green grass sleep at night.   Little birds sing all the day,   Oh, in such a happy way!   All the day the sun is bright,   Little stars shine all the night.   The Cowslip says to the Primrose,   \"How soft the little Spring wind blows!\"   The Daisy and the Buttercup   Sing every time that they look up.   For beneath the sweet blue sky   They see a pretty Butterfly;   The Butterfly, when he looks down,   Says, \"What a pretty Flower Town!\"  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     FROM WONDER WORLD.     Out of Wonder World I think you come;   For in your eyes the wonder comes with you.   The stars are the windows of Heaven,   And sometimes I think you peep through.   Oh, little girl, tell us do the Flowers   Tell you secrets when they find you all alone?   Or the Birds and Butterflies whisper   Of things to us unknown?    Or do angel voices speak to you so softly,   When _we_ only hear a little wind sigh;   And the peaceful dew of Heaven fall upon you   When _we_ only see a white cloud passing by?  [Illustration]         =================================  [Illustration]     CHILD'S SONG.     The King and the Queen were riding     Upon a Summer's day,   And a Blackbird flew above them,     To hear what they did say.    The King said he liked apples,     The Queen said she liked pears.   And what shall we do to the Blackbird     Who listens unawares.         =================================  [Illustration]     MISS MOLLY AND THE LITTLE FISHES.     Oh, sweet Miss Molly,   You're so fond   Of Fishes in a little Pond.   And perhaps they're glad   To see you stare   With such bright eyes   Upon them there.   And when your fingers and your thumbs   Drop slowly in the small white crumbs   I hope they're happy. Only this--   When you've looked long enough, sweet miss.   Then, most beneficent young giver,   Restore them to their native river.         =================================     THE LITTLE JUMPING GIRLS.   [Illustration]    Jump--jump--jump--     Jump away   From this town into     The next, to-day.    Jump--jump--jump--     Jump over the moon;   Jump all the morning,     And all the noon.    Jump--jump--jump--     Jump all night;   Won't our mothers     Be in a fright?    Jump--jump--jump--     Over the sea;   What wonderful wonders     We shall see.    Jump--jump--jump--     And leave behind   Everything evil     That we may find.    Jump--jump--jump--     Jump far away;   And all come home     Some other day.         =================================     RING-A-RING.     Ring-a-ring of little boys.     Ring-a-ring of girls;   All around--all around,     Twists and twirls.  [Illustration]    You are merry children;     \"Yes, we are.\"   Where do you come from?     \"Not very far.    \"We live in the mountain,     We live in the tree;   And I live in the river-bed,     And you won't catch me!\"         =================================  [Illustration]     ON THE BRIDGE.     If I could see a little fish--   That is what I just now wish!   I want to see his great round eyes   Always open in surprise.    I wish a water rat would glide   Slowly to the other side;   Or a dancing spider sit   On the yellow flags a bit.    I think I'll get some stones to throw,   And watch the pretty circles show.   Or shall we sail a flower-boat,   And watch it slowly--slowly float?    That's nice--because you never know   How far away it means to go;   And when to-morrow comes, you see,   It may be in the great wide sea.         =================================  [Illustration]     BALL.     One--two, is one to you:   One--two--three, is one to me.   Throw it fast or not at all,   And mind you do not let it fall.    Fairy Blue Eyes     And Fairy Brown,   And dear little Golden Curls,     Look down.   I say \"Good-bye\"--     \"Good-bye\" with no pain--   Till some happy day     We meet again!
