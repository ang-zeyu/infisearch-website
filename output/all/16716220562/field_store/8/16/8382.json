I was not a member, but on invitation addressed the Convention. The succeeding Legislature instructed me, as a Senator, to assert this equality, and, under the existing circumstances, to resist by all constitutional means the admission of California as a State. At a called session of the Legislature in 1850, a self-constituted committee called on me, by letter, for my views. They were men who had enacted or approved the resolutions of the Convention of 1849, and instructed me, as members of the Legislature, in regular session, in the early part of the year 1850. To them I replied that I adhered to the policy they had indicated and instructed me in their official character to pursue.  \"I pointed out the mode in which their policy could, in my opinion, be executed without bloodshed or disastrous convulsion, but in terms of bitter scorn alluded to such as would insult me with a desire to destroy the Union, for which my whole life proved me to be a devotee.  \"Pardon the egotism, in consideration of the occasion, when I say to you that my father and my uncles fought through the Revolution of 1776, giving their youth, their blood, and their little patrimony to the constitutional freedom which I claim as my inheritance. Three of my brothers fought in the war of 1812. Two of them were comrades of the Hero of the Hermitage, and received his commendation for gallantry at New Orleans. At sixteen years of age I was given to the service of my country; for twelve years of my life I have borne its arms and served it, zealously, if not well. As I feel the infirmities, which suffering more than age has brought upon me, it would be a bitter reflection, indeed, if I was forced to conclude that my countrymen would hold all this light when weighed against the empty panegyric which a time-serving politician can bestow upon the Union, for which he never made a sacrifice.  \"In the Senate I announced that, if any respectable man would call me a disunionist, I would answer him in monosyllables.... But I have often asserted the right, for which the battles of the Revolution were fought--the right of a people to change their government whenever it was found to be oppressive, and subversive of the objects for which governments are instituted--and have contended for the independence and sovereignty of the States, a part of the creed of which Jefferson was the apostle, Madison the expounder, and Jackson the consistent defender.  \"I have written freely, and more than I designed. Accept my thanks for your friendly advocacy. Present me in terms of kind remembrance to your family, and believe me, very sincerely yours,  \"Jefferson Davis.  \"Note.--No party in Mississippi ever advocated disunion. They differed as to the mode of securing their rights in the Union, and on the power of a State to secede--neither advocating the exercise of the power.  \"J.D.\" ]     CHAPTER IV.

Happy in the peaceful pursuits of a planter; busily engaged in cares for servants, in the improvement of my land, in building, in rearing live-stock, and the like occupations, the time passed pleasantly away until my retirement was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, who had been elected to the Presidency of the United States in November, 1852. Although warmly attached to Mr. Pierce personally, and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and political principles, private and personal reasons led me to decline the offer. This was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his inauguration, which took place on the 4th of March, 1853. While in Washington, on this visit, I was induced by public considerations to reconsider my determination and accept the office of Secretary of War. The public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed.  While in the Senate, I had advocated the construction of a railway to connect the valley of the Mississippi with the Pacific coast; and, when an appropriation was made to determine the most eligible route for that purpose, the Secretary of War was charged with its application. We had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem. Several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the United States. The arguments which I had used as a Senator were \"the military necessity for such means of transportation, and the need of safe and rapid communication with the Pacific slope, to secure its continuance as a part of the Union.\"  In the organization and equipment of these parties, and in the selection of their officers, care was taken to provide for securing full and accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of the route. The only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line, and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys.  In like manner, my advocacy while in the Senate of an extension of the Capitol, by the construction of a new Senate-Chamber and Hall of Representatives, may have caused the appropriation for that object to be put under my charge as Secretary of War.  During my administration of the War Department, material changes were made in the models of arms. Iron gun-carriages were introduced, and experiments were made which led to the casting of heavy guns hollow, instead of boring them after casting. Inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder, which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery.  During the same period the army was increased by the addition of two regiments of infantry and two of cavalry. The officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life. In making the selections from the army, I was continually indebted to the assistance of that pure-minded and accurately informed officer, Colonel Samuel Cooper, the Adjutant-General, of whom it may be proper here to say that, although his life had been spent in the army, and he, of course, had the likes and dislikes inseparable from men who are brought into close contact and occasional rivalry, I never found in his official recommendations any indication of partiality or prejudice toward any one.  When the first list was made out, to be submitted to the President, a difficulty was found to exist, which had not occurred either to Colonel Cooper or myself. This was, that the officers selected purely on their military record did not constitute a roster conforming to that distribution among the different States, which, for political considerations, it was thought desirable to observe--that is to say, the number of such officers of Southern birth was found to be disproportionately great. Under instructions from the President, the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution. This, as I am happy to remember, was the only occasion in which the current of my official action, while Secretary of War, was disturbed in any way by sectional or political considerations.  Under former administrations of the War Office it had not been customary to make removals or appointments upon political grounds, except in the case of clerkships. To this usage I not only adhered, but extended it to include the clerkships also. The Chief Clerk, who had been removed by my predecessor, had peculiar qualifications for the place; and, although known to me only officially, he was restored to the position. It will probably be conceded by all who are well informed on the subject that his restoration was a benefit to the public service.[11]  [The reader desirous for further information relative to the administration of the War Department during this period may find it in the various official reports and estimates of works of defense prosecuted or recommended, arsenals of construction and depots of arms maintained or suggested, and foundries employed, during the Presidency of Mr. Pierce, 1853-'57.]  Having been again elected by the Legislature of Mississippi as Senator to the United States, I passed from the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, on the last day of his term (March 4, 1857), to take my seat in the Senate.  The Administration of Franklin Pierce presents the only instance in our history of the continuance of a Cabinet for four years without a single change in its _personnel_. When it is remembered that there was much dissimilarity if not incongruity of character among the members of that Cabinet, some idea may be formed of the power over men possessed and exercised by Mr. Pierce. Chivalrous, generous, amiable, true to his friends and to his faith, frank and bold in the declaration of his opinions, he never deceived any one. And, if treachery had ever come near him, it would have stood abashed in the presence of his truth, his manliness, and his confiding simplicity.   [Footnote 11: Soon after my entrance upon duty as secretary of War, General Jesup, the Quartermaster-General, presented to me a list of names from which to make selection of a clerk for his department. Observing that he had attached certain figures to these names, I asked whether the figures were intended to indicate the relative qualifications, or preference in his estimation, of the several applicants;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19834"],["title","Ethel Morton's Holidays (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: THE GIRLS MADE CANDIES AND COOKIES FOR EVERYBODY _Page 73_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Juvenile Library  Girls Series  ETHEL MORTON'S HOLIDAYS  BY MABELL S.

Cleveland  ------------------------------------------------------------------------     ETHEL MORTON'S HOLIDAYS  CHAPTER I  PREPARATIONS   The big brown automobile gave three honks as it swung around the corner from Church Street. Roger Morton, raking leaves in the yard beside his house, threw down his rake and vaulted over the gate.  \"Good afternoon, sir,\" he called to his grandfather, saluting, soldier fashion.  \"Good afternoon, son. I stopped to tell you that those pumpkins are ready for you. If you'll hop in now we can go out and get them and I'll bring you back again.\"  \"Good enough!\" exclaimed Roger. \"I'll tell Mother I'm going. She may have some message for Grandmother,\" and he vaulted back over the gate and dashed up the steps.  In a minute he was out again and climbing into the car.  \"Where are the girls this afternoon?\" inquired Mr. Emerson, as he threw in the clutch and started toward the outskirts of Rosemont where he had land enough to allow him to do a little farming.  \"Helen and Ethel Brown have gone to the West Woods,\" replied Roger, accounting for his sisters. \"Somebody told them that there was a wild grapevine there that still had yellow leaves bright enough for them to use for decorating tomorrow evening.\"  \"I should be afraid last night's frost would have shriveled them. What are Ethel Blue and Dorothy up to?\" asked Mr. Emerson.  Ethel Blue was Roger's cousin who had lived with the Mortons since her babyhood. Dorothy Smith was also his cousin. She and her mother lived in a cottage on Church Street.  \"They must be over at Dorothy's working up schemes for tomorrow,\" Roger answered his grandfather's question. \"I haven't seen them since luncheon.\"  \"How many do you expect at your party?\"  \"Just two or three more besides the United Service Club. James Hancock won't be able to come, though. His leg isn't well enough yet.\"  \"Pretty bad break?\"  \"He says it's bad enough to make him remember not to cut corners when he's driving a car. Any break is too bad in my humble opinion.\"  \"In mine, too. How many in the Club? Ten?\"  \"Ten; yes, sir. There'll be nine of us tomorrow evening--Helen and the Ethels and Dorothy and Dicky and the two Watkinses and Margaret Hancock. She's going to spend the night with Dorothy.\"  \"Anybody from school?\"  \"George Foster, the fellow who danced the minuet so well in our show; and Dr. Edward Watkins is coming out with Tom and Della.\"  \"Isn't he rather old to come to a kids' party?\"  \"Of course he's loads older than we are--he's twenty-five--but he said he hadn't been to a Hallowe'en party for so long that he wanted to come, and Tom and Della said he put up such a plaintive wail that they asked if they might bring him.\"  \"I suspect he hasn't forgotten how to play,\" chuckled Grandfather Emerson, speeding up as they entered the long, open stretch of road that ended almost at his own door. \"Any idea what you're going to do?\"  \"Not much. Helen and Ethel Brown are the decoration committee and I'm the jack-o'-lantern committee, as you know, and Ethel Blue and Dorothy are thinking up things to do and we're all going to add suggestions. I think the girls had a note from Della this morning with an idea of some sort in it.\"  \"You ought to get Burns's poem.\"  \"On Hallowe'en?\"  \"We'll look it up when we get to the house. You may find some 'doings' you haven't heard of that you can revive for the occasion.\"  \"We decided that whatever we did do, there were certain stunts we wouldn't do.\"  \"Namely?\"  \"Swap signs and take off gates and brilliant jokes of that sort.\"  \"As a Service Club you couldn't very well crack jokes whose point lies in some one's discomfort, could you?\"  \"Those things have looked like dog mean tricks to me and not jokes at all ever since I saw an old woman at the upper end of Main Street trying to hang her gate last year the day after Hallowe'en.\"  \"Too heavy for her?\"  \"I should say so. She couldn't do anything with it. I offered to help her, and she said, 'You might as well, for I suppose you had the fun of unhanging it last night'.\"  \"A false accusation, I suppose.\"  \"It happened to be that time, but I had done it before,\" confessed Roger, flushing.  \"You never happened to see the result of it before.\"  \"That's it. I just thought of the people's surprise when they waked up in the morning and found their gates gone. I never thought at all of the real pain and discomfort that it may have given a lot of them.\"  \"Your Club may be doing a good service to all Rosemont if it proves that young people can have a good time without making the 'innocent bystander' pay for it.\"  \"We're going to prove it; to ourselves, anyway,\" insisted Roger stoutly, as he leaped out of the car and took his grandfather's parcels into the house.  \"The pumpkins are in the barn,\" Mr. Emerson called after him. \"Go down there and pick them out when you've given those bundles to your grandmother.\"  The big yellow globes were loaded into the car--half a dozen of them--and Mr. Emerson drove back to the house. As he stopped at the side porch for a last word with his wife he gave a cry of recognition.  \"Look who comes here!\" he exclaimed.  \"Helen and Ethel Brown,\" guessed Roger. \"Don't they look like those soldiers we read about in 'Macbeth'--the fellows who marched along holding boughs in their hands so that it looked as if Birnamwood had come to Dunsinane.\"  \"Roger is quoting Shakespeare about your personal appearance,\" laughed Mr. Emerson as he and his grandson relieved the girls of their burdens.  They sank down on the steps of the porch and panted.  \"You're tired out,\" exclaimed their grandmother. \"Roger, bring out that pitcher of lemonade you'll find in the dining-room. How far have you walked?\"  \"About a thousand miles, I should say,\" declared Helen. \"We were bound we'd get out-of-door decorations if they were to be had, and they weren't to be had except by hunting.\"  \"You're like me--I like to use out-of-door things as late as I can; there are so many months when you have to go to the greenhouse or to draw on your house plants.\"  \"Ethel Blue and Dorothy have been educating the Club artistically. They've been pointing out how much color there is in the fields and the woods even after the bright autumn colors have gone by.\"  \"That's quite true. Look at that meadow.\"  Mrs. Emerson waved her hand at the field across the road. On it sedges were waving, softly brown; tufts of mouse-gray goldenrod nodded before the breeze; chestnut-hued cat-tails stood guard in thick ranks, and a delicate Indian Summer haze blended all into a harmony of warm, dull shades.  \"You found your grapevine,\" said Roger, pouring the lemonade for his weary sisters, and nodding toward a trail of handsome leaves, splendidly yellow.  \"It took a hunt, though. What are you doing over here?\"  \"Getting the pumpkins Grandfather promised us.\"  \"You're just in time to have a ride home,\" said Mr. Emerson.  \"You're in no hurry, Father; let the girls rest a while,\" urged Mrs. Emerson. \"Can't you make a jack-o'-lantern while you're waiting, Roger?\"  \"Yes, _ma'am_, I can turn you out a truly superior article in a wonderfully short time,\" bragged Roger.  \"He really does make them very well,\" confirmed Helen, \"but it's because he always has the benefit of our valuable advice.\"  \"Here you are to give it if I need it,\" said Roger good naturedly. \"We'll show Grandmother what our united efforts can do.\"  So the girls leaned back comfortably against the pillars at the sides of the steps and Mrs. Emerson sat in an arm chair at the top of the flight and Mr. Emerson sat in the car at the foot of the steps and Roger began his work.  \"It'll be a wonder if I make anything but a failure with so many bosses,\" he complained.  \"Keep your hand steady, old man,\" teased his grandfather. \"Don't let your knife go through the side or you'll let out a crack of light where you don't mean to.\"  \"Be sure your knife doesn't slip and cut your fingers,\" advised Mrs. Emerson.  \"Save me the inside,\" begged Ethel Brown. \"I'm going to try to make a pumpkin pie.\"  \"Save the top for a hat,\" laughed Helen. \"I'll trim it with brown ribbon and set a new style at school.\"  Roger dug away industriously under the spur of these remarks.  \"Is this the first year you've had a Hallowe'en party?\" Mrs. Emerson asked.  \"We used to do a few little things when we were children,\" Helen answered; \"but for the last few years we've been asked somewhere.\"  \"And with all due respect to our hosts we did a lot of the stupidest and meanest things we ever got let in for,\" declared Roger. \"I was telling Grandfather about some of them coming over.\"  \"So we made up our minds that we'd celebrate as a club this year, and do whatever we wanted to. There's a lot more to a party than just the party,\" said Ethel Brown wisely.  Her grandmother nodded.  \"You're right. The preparation is half the fun,\" she agreed. \"And it's fun to have every part of it perfect--the decorations and the refreshments as well as whatever it is you do for your main amusement.\"  \"That's what I think,\" said Helen. \"I like to think that the house is going to be appropriately dressed for our Hallowe'en party just as much as we ourselves.\"  \"Why doesn't your club give a series of holiday parties?\" suggested Grandfather. \"Make each one of them a really appropriate celebration and not just an ordinary party hung on the holiday as an excuse peg. I believe you could have some interesting times and do some good, too, so that it could honestly be brought within the scope of your Club's activities.\"  \"We seem to have made a "]]]
