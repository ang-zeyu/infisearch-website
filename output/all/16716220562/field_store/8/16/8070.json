The _extent of the staff_ may be increased either above or below by the addition of short lines called _leger lines_,[4] and notes may be written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them.  [Footnote 4: The word _leger_ is derived from the French word _LÃ‰GER_, meaning light, and this use of the word refers to the fact that the leger lines, being added by hand, are lighter--_i.e._, less solid in color--than the printed lines of the staff itself.]  14. The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger lines if any) are often referred to as _staff degrees_, _i.e._, each separate line and space is considered to be \"a degree of the staff.\" The tones of a scale are also sometimes referred to as \"degrees of the scale.\"  15. A _clef_[5] is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches are to be represented by its lines and spaces. Thus, _e.g._, the G clef shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G, but that the first line represents E, the first space F, etc. The F clef similarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the first A below middle C, the fourth line the first F below middle C, etc.  [Footnote 5: The word _clef_ is derived from _CLAVIS_--a key--the reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the meaning of the staff, as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the puzzle.]  The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of the letters G and F, which (among others) were used to designate the pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first inaugurated. For a fuller discussion of this matter see Appendix A, p. 101. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"Appendix I\" in original.]  16. When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the _treble staff_, and when the F clef is used, as the _bass staff_. Such expressions as \"singing from the treble clef,\" or \"singing in the treble clef,\" and \"singing in the bass clef\" are still frequently heard, but are preferably replaced by \"singing from the treble staff,\" and \"singing from the bass staff.\" Fig. 6 shows the permanent names of lines and spaces when the G and F clefs are used.[6]  [Footnote 6: The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with two exceptions, viz., our B is called by them H, and our B[flat] is called B. The scale of C therefore reads: C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C; the scale of F reads F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The signatures are in all cases written exactly as we write them.  In France and Italy where the \"fixed DO\" system is in vogue, pitches are usually referred to by the syllable names; _e.g._, C is referred to as DO (or UT), D as RE, etc.]  [Illustration: Fig. 6.]  17. _The movable C clef_ [C clef symbol] or [tenor clef symbol], formerly in very common use, is now utilized for only two purposes, viz., (1) in music written for certain orchestral instruments (cello, viola, etc.) of extended range, in order to avoid having to use too many leger lines; and (2) for indicating the tenor part in vocal music. This latter usage seems also to be disappearing however, and the tenor part is commonly written on the treble staff, it being understood that the tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate.  The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9. It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is placed represents \"middle C.\"  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Soprano clef.]  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Alto clef.]  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Tenor clef.]  18. A _sharp_ is a character which causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it otherwise would.       Thus in Fig. 10 (_a_) the fifth line and first space represent      the pitch F, but in Fig. 10 (_b_) these same staff degrees      represent an entirely different tone--F[sharp]. The student      should note that the sharp does not then _raise_ anything; it      merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than      it otherwise would. There is just as much difference between F      and F[sharp] as between B and C, and yet one would never think      of referring to C as \"B raised\"!  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]  19. A _flat_ is a character that causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a tone one half-step lower than it otherwise would. (See note under Sec. 18 and apply the same discussion here.)  20. A _double-sharp_ causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step higher than it would without any sharp. Similarly, a double-flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than it would without any flat.       Double-sharps and double-flats are generally used on staff      degrees that have already been sharped or flatted, therefore      their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent      pitches respectively a half-step higher and a half-step lower      than would be represented by those same degrees in their      diatonic condition. Thus in Fig. 10 (_b_) the first space in      its diatonic condition[7] represents F-sharp, and the      double-sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a      pitch one-half step higher than F-sharp, _i.e._,      F-double-sharp.  [Footnote 7: The expression \"diatonic condition\" as here used refers to the staff after the signature has been placed upon it, in other words after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the diatonic scale.]     CHAPTER III  SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED (_Continued_)   21. The _natural_[8] (sometimes called _cancel_) annuls the effect of previous sharps, flats, double-sharps, and double-flats, within the measure in which it occurs. After a double-sharp or double-flat the combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a flat is often found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled. (Sometimes also the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, cancelling the double-sharp or double-flat). The natural is often used when a composition changes key, as in Fig. 11, where a change from E to G is shown.  [Footnote 8: It has already been noted (p. 6, Note) that in the German scale our b-flat is called b, and our b is called H. From this difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H (now made [natural]) to show that _any_ staff-degree is in _natural_ condition, _i.e._, not sharped or flatted.]  [Illustration: Fig. 11.]  22. The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is written. They are called collectively the _key-signature_.  23. The same key-signature may stand for either one of two keys, the major key, or its relative minor, hence in order to determine in what key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA. In a harmonized composition it is almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last bass note; if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is in the major key, but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the minor key. Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig. 12 the composition is clearly in G major, while if it appears as in Fig. 13, it is just as surely in E minor.  [Illustration: Fig. 12.]  [Illustration: Fig. 13.]  24. Sharps, flats, naturals, double-sharps and double-flats, occurring in the course of the composition (_i.e._, after the key signature) are called _accidentals_, whether they actually cause a staff degree to represent a different pitch as in Fig. 14 or simply make clear a notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig. 15, measure two. The effect of such accidentals terminates at the bar.  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]  [Illustration: Fig. 15.]  25. In the case of a _tie across a bar_ an accidental remains in force until the combined value of the tied notes expires. In Fig. 16 first measure, third beat, an accidental sharp makes the third space represent the pitch C sharp. By virtue of the tie across the bar the third space continues to represent C sharp thru the first beat of the second measure, but for the remainder of the measure the third space will represent C unless the sharp is repeated as in Fig. 17.  [Illustration: Fig. 16.]  [Illustration: Fig. 17.]  26. The following rules for making staff degrees represent pitches different from those of the diatonic scale will be found useful by the beginner in the study of music notation. These rules are quoted from \"The Worcester Musical Manual,\" by Charles I. Rice.       1. To sharp a natural degree, use a sharp. Fig. 18.      2. To sharp a sharped degree, use a double sharp. Fig. 19.      3. To sharp a flatted degree, use a natural. Fig. 20.      4. To flat a natural degree, use a flat. Fig. 21.      5. To flat a flatted degree, use a double flat. Fig. 22.      6. To flat a sharped degree, use a natural. Fig. 23.  [Illustration: Fig. 18.]  [Illustration: Fig. 19.]  [Illustration: Fig. 20.]  [Illustration: Fig. 21.]  [Illustration: Fig. 22.]  [Illustration: Fig. 23.]  27. When two different notations represent the same pitch, the word _enharmonic_ is applied. Thus we may say that F sharp and G flat (on keyboard instruments at least) are enharmonically the same.  This word _enharmonic_ is used in such expressions as enharmonic change, enharmonic keys, enharmonic interval, enharmonic modulation, enharmonic relation, etc., and in all such combinations it has the same meaning, viz.--a change in notation but no change in the pitch represented.  28. A _note_ is a character expressing relative duration, which when placed on a staff indicates that a certain tone is to be sounded for a certain relative length of time. The pitch of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],["title","Music Notation and Terminology (#3)"],["body"," tone to be sounded is shown by the position of the note on the staff, while the length of time it is to be prolonged is shown by the shape of the note. Thus _e.g._, a half-note on the second line of the treble staff indicates that a specific pitch (g') is to be played or sung for a period of time twice as long as would be indicated by a quarter-note in the same composition.  29. A _rest_ is a character which indicates a rhythmic silence of a certain relative length.  30. The _notes and rests in common use_ are as follows:  [symbol] Whole-note. An open note-head without stem. [symbol] Half-note. An open note-head with stem. [symbol] Quarter-note. A closed note-head with stem. [symbol] Eighth-note. A closed note-head with stem and one hook. [symbol] Sixteenth-note. A closed note-head with stem and two hooks. [symbol] Thirty-second-note. A closed note-head with stem and three hooks. [symbol] Whole-rest. [symbol] Half-rest. [symbol] Quarter-rest. [symbol] Eighth-rest. [symbol] Sixteenth-rest. [symbol] Thirty-second-rest.  31. The _English names_ for these notes are:  Whole-note--semi-breve. Half-note--minim. Quarter-note--crotchet. Eighth-note--quaver. Sixteenth-note--semi-quaver. Thirty-second-note--demi-semi-quaver.  The corresponding rests are referred to by the same system of nomenclature: _e.g._, _semi-breve rest_, etc.  32. _Sixty-fourth_ and _one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth-notes_ are occasionally found, but are not in common use. The _double-whole-note_ (_breve_), made [breve symbol] or [old breve symbol], is still used, especially in English music, which frequently employs the half-note as the beat-unit. Thus in four-half measure the breve would be necessary to indicate a tone having four beats.  33. The _whole-rest_ has a peculiarity of usage not common to any of the other duration symbols, viz., that it is often employed as a _measure-rest_, filling an entire measure of beats, no matter what the measure-signature may be. Thus, not only in four-quarter-measure, but in two-quarter, three-quarter, six-eighth, and other varieties, the whole-rest fills the entire measure, having a value sometimes greater, sometimes less than the corresponding whole-note. Because of this peculiarity of usage the whole-rest is termed _Takt-pausa_ (measure-rest) by the Germans.  34. A _bar_ is a vertical line across the staff, dividing it into measures. The word _bar_ is often used synonymously with _measure_ by orchestral conductors and others; thus, \"begin at the fourteenth bar after J.\" This use of the word, although popular, is incorrect.  35. A _double-bar_ consists of two vertical lines across the staff, at least one of the two being a heavy line. The double bar marks the end of a division, movement, or entire composition.     CHAPTER IV  ABBREVIATIONS, SIGNS, ETC.   36. A _double bar_ (or single heavy bar) with either two or four dots indicates that a section is to be repeated. If the repeat marks occur at only one point the entire preceding part is to be repeated, but if the marks occur twice (the first time at the right of the bar but the second time at the left), only the section thus enclosed by the marks is to be repeated.  [Illustration]  37. Sometimes a different cadence (or ending) is to be used for the repetition, and this is indicated as in Fig. 24.  [Illustration: Fig. 24.]  38. The Italian word _bis_ is occasionally used to indicate that a certain passage or section is to be repeated. This use is becoming obsolete.  39. The words _da capo_ (_D.C._) mean literally \"from the head,\" _i.e._, repeat from the beginning. The words _dal segno_ (_D.S._) indicate a repetition from the sign ([segno symbol] or [segno symbol]) instead of from the beginning.  In the case of both _D.C._ and _D.S._ the word _fine_ (meaning literally _the end_) is ordinarily used to designate the point at which the repeated section is to terminate. The fermata ([fermata symbol]) was formerly in common use for this same purpose, but is seldom so employed at present.       _D.C._ (_sin_[9]) _al fine_ means--repeat from the beginning      to the word \"fine.\"       [Footnote 9: The word _sin_ is a contraction of the Italian      word _sino_, meaning \"as far as\" or \"until\"; in the term given      above (Sec. 39) it is really superfluous as the word _al_      includes in itself both preposition and article, meaning \"to      the.\"]       _D.C. al_ [fermata symbol] means--repeat to the fermata (or      hold).       _D.C. senza repetizione_, or _D.C. ma senza repetizione_,      [Transcriber's Note: Corrected misspelling \"repetitione\"] both      mean--repeat from the beginning, but without observing other      repeat marks during the repetition.       _D.C. e poi la coda_ means--repeat the first section only to      the mark [coda symbol], then skip to the coda. (See p. 74,      Sec. 157, for discussion of _coda_).  40. In certain cases where the repetition of characteristic figures can be indicated without causing confusion, it is the practice of composers (especially in orchestral music) to make use of certain _signs of repetition_. Some of the commonest of these abbreviations are shown in the following examples.  [Illustration: Fig. 25.]  [Illustration: Fig. 26.]  [Illustration: Fig. 27.]  In Fig. 28 the repetition of an entire measure is called for.  [Illustration: Fig. 28.]  41. The word _simile_ [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"similie\"] (sometimes _segue_) indicates that a certain effect previously begun is to be continued, as _e.g._, staccato playing, pedalling, style of bowing in violin music, etc. The word _segue_ is also occasionally used to show that an accompaniment figure (especially in orchestral music) is to be continued.  42. _When some part is to rest for two or more measures_ several methods of notation are possible. A rest of two measures is usually indicated thus [Illustration]. Three measures thus [Illustration]. Four measures thus [Illustration]. Rests of more than four measures are usually indicated in one of the following ways: [Illustration]. Sometimes the number of measures is written directly on the staff, thus; [Illustration].  43. The letters G.P. (general pause, or grosse pause), the words _lunga pausa_, or simply the word _lunga_, are sometimes written over a rest to show that there is to be a prolonged pause or rest in all parts. Such expressions are found only in ensemble music, _i.e._, music in which several performers are engaged at the same time.  44. The _fermata_ or _hold_ [fermata symbol] over a note or chord indicates that the tone is to be prolonged, the duration of the prolongation depending upon the character of the music and the taste of the performer or conductor. It has already been noted that the hold over a bar was formerly used to designate the end of the composition, as the word _fine_ is employed at present, but this usage has practically disappeared and the hold over the bar now usually indicates a short rest between two sections of a composition.  45. The sign _8va......_ (an abbreviation of _all'ottava_, [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"al ottava\" in original.] literally at the octave) above the staff, indicates that all tones are to be sounded an octave higher than the notes would indicate. When found below the staff the same sign serves to indicate that the tones are to be sounded an octave lower. The term _8va bassa_ has also this latter signification.  46. Sometimes the word _loco_ (in place) is used to show that the part is no longer to be sounded an octave higher (or lower), but this is more often indicated by the termination of the dotted (or wavy) line.  47. The sign _Col 8_ (_coll'ottava_--with the octave) shows that the tones an octave higher or lower are to be sounded _with_ the tones indicated by the printed notes. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"col ottava\" in original.]  48. For the sake of definiteness in referring to pitches, a particular name is applied to each octave, and all pitches in the octave are referred to by means of a uniform nomenclature. The following figure will make this system clear:  [Illustration: Fig. 29.]  Thus _e.g._, \"great G\" (written simply G), is the G represented by the first line of the bass staff. Small A (written a), is represented by the fifth line of the bass staff. Two-lined G, (written [2-lined g symbol]), is represented by the space above the fifth line, treble staff. Three-lined C, (written [3-lined c symbol]), is represented by the second added line above the treble staff, etc. The _one-lined octave_ may be described as the octave from _middle C_ to the B represented by the third line of the treble staff, and any tone within that octave is referred to as \"one-lined.\" Thus--_one-lined_ D, _one-lined_ G, etc.       In scientific works on acoustics, etc., the pitches in the sub      octave (or sub-contra octave as it is often called) are      referred to as C_2, D_2, E_2, etc.; those in the contra octave      as C_1, D_1, etc.; in the great octave, as c^1, d^1, etc.; in      the small octave as c^2, d^2, etc.     CHAPTER V  ABBREVIATIONS, SIGNS, ETC., (_Continued_)   49. _A dot after a note_ shows that the value of the note is to be half again as great as it would be without the dot, _i.e._, the value is to be three-halves that of the original note.  [Illustration]  50. _When two dots follow the note_ the second dot adds half as much as the first dot has added, _i.e._, the entire value is seven-fourths that of the original note.  [Illustration]  51. _When three dots follow the note_ the third dot adds one-half the value added by the second, _i.e._, the entire value of the triple-dotted note is fifteen-eighths that of the original note.  [Illustration]  52. _A dot over or under a note_ is called the _staccato mark_ and indicates that the tone is to be sounded and then instantly released. [Illustration] In music for organ and for some other instruments the staccato note is sometimes interpreted differently, this depending on the"]]]
