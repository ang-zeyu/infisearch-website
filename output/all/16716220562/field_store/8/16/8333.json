I      have always loved the truth, and sought it; if I have not found      it, the greater my misfortune.'[8]  When Borrow is twenty years of age we have another glimpse of father and son, the father in his last illness, the son eager as usual to draw out his parent upon the one subject that appeals to his adventurous spirit, 'I should like to know something about Big Ben,' he says:       'You are a strange lad,' said my father; 'and though of late I      have begun to entertain a more favourable opinion than      heretofore, there is still much about you that I do not      understand. Why do you bring up that name? Don't you know that      it is one of my temptations? You wish to know something about      him? Well, I will oblige you this once, and then farewell to      such vanities--something about him. I will tell you--his--skin      when he flung off his clothes--and he had a particular knack in      doing so--his skin, when he bared his mighty chest and back      for combat; and when he fought he stood, so--if I remember      right--his skin, I say, was brown and dusky as that of a toad.      Oh me! I wish my elder son was here!'  Concerning the career of Borrow's father there seem to be no documents other than one contained in _Lavengro_, yet no _Life of Borrow_ can possibly he complete that does not draw boldly upon the son's priceless tributes. And so we come now to the last scene in the career of the elder Borrow--his death-bed--which is also the last page of the first volume of _Lavengro_. George Borrow's brother has arrived from abroad. The little house in Willow Lane, Norwich, contained the mother and her two sons sorrowfully awaiting the end, which came on 28th February 1824.       At the dead hour of night--it might be about two--I was      awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from the room      immediately below that in which I slept. I knew the cry--it was      the cry of my mother; and I also knew its import, yet I made no      effort to rise, for I was for the moment paralysed. Again the      cry sounded, yet still I lay motionless--the stupidity of      horror was upon me. A third time, and it was then that, by a      violent effort, bursting the spell which appeared to bind me, I      sprang from the bed and rushed downstairs. My mother was      running wildly about the room; she had awoke and found my      father senseless in the bed by her side. I essayed to raise      him, and after a few efforts supported him in the bed in a      sitting posture. My brother now rushed in, and, snatching up a      light that was burning, he held it to my father's face. 'The      surgeon! the surgeon!' he cried; then, dropping the light, he      ran out of the room, followed by my mother; I remained alone,      supporting the senseless form of my father; the light had been      extinguished by the fall, and an almost total darkness reigned      in the room. The form pressed heavily against my bosom; at last      methought it moved. Yes, I was right; there was a heaving of      the breast, and then a gasping. Were those words which I heard?      Yes, they were words, low and indistinct at first, and then      audible. The mind of the dying man was reverting to former      scenes. I heard him mention names which I had often heard him      mention before. It was an awful moment; I felt stupefied, but I      still contrived to support my dying father. There was a pause;      again my father spoke: I heard him speak of Minden, and of      Meredith, the old Minden Serjeant, and then he uttered another      name, which at one period of his life was much on his lips, the      name of ----; but this is a solemn moment! There was a deep      gasp: I shook, and thought all was over; but I was mistaken--my      father moved, and revived for a moment; he supported himself in      bed without my assistance. I make no doubt that for a moment he      was perfectly sensible, and it was then that, clasping his      hands, he uttered another name clearly, distinctly--it was the      name of Christ. With that name upon his lips the brave old      soldier sank back upon my bosom, and, with his hands still      clasped, yielded up his soul.  Did Borrow's father ever really fight Big Ben Brain or Bryan in Hyde Park, or is it all a fantasy of the artist's imagining? We shall never know. Borrow called his _Lavengro_ 'An Autobiography' at one stage of its inception, although he wished to repudiate the autobiographical nature of his story at another. Dr. Knapp in his anxiety to prove that Borrow wrote his own memoirs in _Lavengro_ and _Romany Rye_ tells us that he had no creative faculty--an absurd proposition. But I think we may accept the contest between Ben Brain and Thomas Borrow, and what a revelation of heredity that impressive death-bed scene may be counted. Borrow on one occasion in later life declared that his favourite hooks were the Bible and the Newgate Calendar. We know that he specialised on the Bible and Prize-Fighting in no ordinary fashion--and here we see his father on his death-bed struggling between the religious sentiments of his maturity and the one great worldly escapade of his early manhood.   FOOTNOTES:  [3] In the year 1870 Borrow was asked for material for a biography by the editor of _Men of the Time_, a publication which many years later was incorporated in the present _Who's Who_. He drew up two drafts in his own handwriting, which are so interesting, and yet vary so much in certain particulars, that we are tempted to print both here, or at least that part of the second draft that differs from the first. The concluding passages of both drafts are alike. The biography as it stands in the 1871 edition of _Men of the Time_ appears to have been compiled from the earlier of these drafts. It must have been another copy of Draft No. 1 that was forwarded to the editor:  DRAFT I.--George Henry Borrow, born at East Dereham in the county of Norfolk in the early part of the present century. His father was a military officer, with whom he travelled about most parts of the United Kingdom. He was at some of the best schools in England, and also for about two years at the High School at Edinburgh. In 1818 he was articled to an eminent solicitor at Norwich, with whom he continued five years. He did not, however, devote himself much to his profession, his mind being much engrossed by philology, for which at a very early period he had shown a decided inclination, having when in Ireland acquired the Irish language. At the age of twenty he knew little of the law, but was well versed in languages, being not only a good classical scholar but acquainted with French, Italian, Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic dialects, and also with the peculiar language of the English Romany Chals or Gypsies. This speech, which, though broken and scanty, exhibits evident signs of high antiquity, he had picked up amongst the wandering tribes with whom he had formed acquaintance on a wild heath near Norwich, where they were in the habit of encamping. At the expiration of his clerkship, which occurred shortly after the death of his father, he betook himself to London, and endeavoured to get a livelihood by literature. For some time he was a hack author. His health failing he left London, and for a considerable time lived a life of roving adventure. In the year 1833 he entered the service of he British and Foreign Bible Society, and being sent to Russia edited at Saint Petersburg the New Testament in the Manchu or Chinese Tartar. Whilst at Saint Petersburg he published a book called _Targum_, consisting of metrical translations from thirty languages. He was subsequently for some years agent of the Bible Society in Spain, where he was twice imprisoned for endeavouring to circulate the Gospel. In Spain he mingled much with the Cal√≥re or Zincali, called by the Spaniards Gitanos or Gypsies, whose language he found to be much the same as that of the English Romany. At Madrid he edited the New Testament in Spanish, and translated the Gospel of Saint Luke into the language of the Zincali. Leaving the service of the Bible Society he returned to England in 1839, and shortly afterwards married a Suffolk lady. In 1841 he published _The Zincali_, or an account of the Gypsies of Spain, with a vocabulary of their language, which he proved to be closely connected with the Sanskrit. This work obtained almost immediately a European celebrity, and was the cause of many learned works being published on the continent on the subject of the Gypsies. In 1842 he gave to the world _The Bible in Spain_, or an account of an attempt to circulate the Gospel in the peninsula, a work which received a warm and eloquent eulogium from Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons. In 1844 he was wandering amongst the Gypsies of Hungary, Walachia, and Turkey, gathering up the words of their respective dialects of the Romany, and making a collection of their songs. In 1851 he published _Lavengro_, in which he gives an account of his early life, and in 1857 _The Romany Rye_, a sequel to the same. His latest publication is _Wild Wales_. He has written many other works, some of which are not yet published. He has an estate in Suffolk, but spends the greater part of his time in wandering on foot through various countries.         *       *       *       *       *  DRAFT II.--George Henry Borrow was born at East Dereham in the county of Norfolk on the 5th July 1803. His father, Thomas Borrow, who died captain and adjutant of the West Norfolk Militia, was of an ancient but reduced Cornish family, tracing descent from the de Burghs, and entitled to carry their arms. His mother, Ann Perfrement, was a native of Norfolk, and descended from a family of French Protestants banished from France on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He was the youngest of two sons. His brother, John Thomas, who was endowed with various and very"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19767"],["title","George Borrow and His Circle (#4)"],["body","talents, died at an early age in Mexico. Both the brothers had the advantage of being at some of the first schools in Britain. The last at which they were placed was the Grammar School at Norwich, to which town their father came to reside at the termination of the French war. In the year 1818 George Borrow was articled to an eminent solicitor in Norwich, with whom he continued five years. He did not devote himself much to his profession, his mind being engrossed by another and very different subject--namely philology, for which at a very early period he had shown a decided inclination, having when in Ireland with his father acquired the Irish language. At the expiration of his clerkship he knew little of the law, but was well versed in languages, being not only a good Greek and Latin scholar, but acquainted with French, Italian, and Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic dialects, and likewise with the peculiar language of the English Romany Chals or Gypsies. This speech or jargon, amounting to about eleven hundred and twenty-seven words, he had picked up amongst the wandering tribes with whom he had formed acquaintance on Mousehold, a wild heath near Norwich, where they were in the habit of encamping. By the time his clerkship was expired his father was dead, and he had little to depend upon but the exercise of his abilities such as they were. In 1823 he betook himself to London, and endeavoured to obtain a livelihood by literature. For some time he was a hack author, doing common work for booksellers. For one in particular he prepared an edition of the Newgate Calendar, from the careful study of which he has often been heard to say that he first learned to write genuine English. His health failed, he left London, and for a considerable time he lived a life of roving adventure.  [4] Knapp's _Life of Borrow_, vol. i. p. 6.  [5] The writer recalls at his own school at Downham Market in Norfolk an old Crimean Veteran--Serjeant Canham--drilling the boys each week, thus supplementing his income precisely in the same manner as did Serjeant Borrow.  [6] The date has always hitherto been wrongly given. I find it in one of Ann Borrow's notebooks, but although every vicar of every parish in Chelmsford and Colchester has searched the registers for me, with agreeable courtesy, I cannot discover a record of John's birthplace, and am compelled to the belief that Dr. Knapp was wrong in suggesting one or other of these towns.

CHAPTER II  BORROW'S MOTHER   Throughout his whole life George Borrow adored his mother, who seems to have developed into a woman of great strength of character far remote from the pretty play-actor who won the heart of a young soldier at East Dereham in the last years of the eighteenth century. We would gladly know something of the early years of Ann Perfrement. Her father was a farmer, whose farm at Dumpling Green we have already described. He did not, however, 'farm his own little estate' as Borrow declared. The grandfather--a French Protestant--came, if we are to believe Borrow, from Caen in Normandy after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but there is no documentary evidence to support the contention. However, the story of the Huguenot immigration into England is clearly bound up with Norwich and the adjacent district. And so we may well take the name of 'Perfrement' as conclusive evidence of a French origin, and reject as utterly untenable the not unnatural suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that Borrow's mother was 'of gypsy descent.'[9] She was one of the eight children of Samuel and Mary Perfrement, all of whom seem to have devoted their lives to East Anglia.[10] We owe to Dr. Knapp's edition of _Lavengro_ one exquisite glimpse of Ann's girlhood that is not in any other issue of the book. Ann's elder sister, curious to know if she was ever to be married, falls in with the current superstition that she must wash her linen and 'watch' it drying before the fire between eleven and twelve at night. Ann Perfrement was ten years old at the time. The two girls walked over to East Dereham, purchased the necessary garment, washed it in the pool near the house that may still be seen, and watched and watched. Suddenly when the clock struck twelve they heard, or thought they heard, a footstep on the path, the wind howled, and the elder sister sprang to the door, locked and bolted it, and then fell in convulsions on the floor. The superstition, which Borrow seems to have told his mother had a Danish origin, is common enough in Ireland and in Celtic lands. It could scarcely have been thus rehearsed by two Norfolk children had they not had the blood of a more imaginative race in their veins. In addition to this we find more than one effective glimpse of Borrow's mother in _Lavengro_. We have already noted the episode in which she takes the side of her younger boy against her husband, with whom John was the favourite. We meet her again in the following dialogue, with its pathetic allusions to Dante and to the complaint--a kind of nervous exhaustion which he called 'the horrors'--that was to trouble Borrow all his days:       'What ails you, my child?' said a mother to her son, as he lay      on a couch under the influence of the dreadful one; 'what ails      you? you seem afraid!'       _Boy._ And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon me.       _Mother._ But of what? there is no one can harm you; of what      are you apprehensive?       _Boy._ Of nothing that I can express. I know not what I am      afraid of, but afraid I am.       _Mother._ Perhaps you see sights and visions. I knew a lady      once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed man      threaten her, but it was only an imagination, a phantom of the      brain.       _Boy._ No armed man threatens me; and 'tis not a thing like      that would cause me any fear. Did an armed man threaten me I      would get up and fight him; weak as I am, I would wish for      nothing better, for then, perhaps, I should lose this fear;      mine is a dread of I know not what, and there the horror lies.       _Mother._ Your forehead is cool, and your speech collected. Do      you know where you are?       _Boy._ I know where I am, and I see things just as they are;      you are beside me, and upon the table there is a book which was      written by a Florentine; all this I see, and that there is no      ground for being afraid. I am, moreover, quite cool, and feel      no pain--but, but----       And then there was a burst of 'gemiti, sospiri ed alti guai.'      Alas, alas, poor child of clay! as the sparks fly upward, so      wast thou born to sorrow--Onward![11]  Our next glimpse of Mrs. Borrow is when after his father's death George had shouldered his knapsack and made his way to London to seek his fortune by literature. His elder brother had remained at home, determined upon being a painter, but joined George in London, leaving the widowed mother momentarily alone in Norwich.       'And how are things going on at home?' said I to my brother,      after we had kissed and embraced. 'How is my mother, and how is      the dog?'       'My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,' said my brother,      'but very much given to fits of crying. As for the dog, he is      not so well; but we will talk more of these matters anon,' said      my brother, again glancing at the breakfast things. 'I am very      hungry, as you may suppose, after having travelled all night.'       Thereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform      the duties of hospitality, and I made my brother welcome--I may      say more than welcome; and when the rage of my brother's hunger      was somewhat abated, we recommenced talking about the matters      of our little family, and my brother told me much about my      mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but said that of late      the said fits of crying had much diminished, and she appeared      to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much mistaken, my      brother told me that my mother had of late the prayer-book      frequently in her hand, and yet oftener the Bible.[12]  Ann Borrow lived in Willow Lane, Norwich, for thirty-three years. That Borrow was a devoted husband these pages will show. He was also a devoted son. When he had made a prosperous marriage he tried hard to persuade his mother to live with him at Oulton, but all in vain. She had the wisdom to see that such an arrangement is rarely conducive to a son's domestic happiness. She continued to live in the little cottage made sacred by many associations until almost the end of her days. Here she had lived in earlier years with her husband and her two ambitious boys, and in Norwich, doubtless, she had made her own friendships, although of these no record remains. The cottage still stands in its modest court, but is at the moment untenanted. There is a letter extant from Cecilia Lucy Brightwell, who wrote _The Life of Mrs. Opie_, to Mary Borrow at Oulton, when Mrs. Borrow the elder had gone to live there, which records the fact that in 1851, two years after Mrs. Borrow had left the cottage in Willow Lane, it had already changed its appearance. Mrs. Brightwell writes:       Give my kind love to dear mother. Tell her I went past her      house to-day and looked up the court. It is quite changed: all      the trees and the ivy taken away.  The house was the property of Thomas King, a carpenter. You enter from Willow Lane through a covered passage into what was then known as King's Court. Here the little house faces you, and you meet it with a peculiarly agreeable sensation, recalling more than one incident in _Lavengro_ that transpired there. In 1897 the then mayor made the one attempt of his city of a whole half century to honour Borrow by calling this court Borrow's Court--thereby conferring a ridiculously small distinction upon Borrow,[13] and removing a landmark connected with one of its own worthy"]]]
