A working knowledge of these auxiliary terms will aid the student greatly in arriving at the meaning of hundreds of terms without stopping to look up each individual one.     CHAPTER X  MEASURE   97. From the standpoint of the eye, a _measure_ is that portion of the staff found between two bars, (in certain cases this space may be less than a measure, as _e.g._, at the beginning and end of a movement); but from the standpoint of the ear a single, isolated measure is not possible, and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form.  _Measures_ are similarly accented groups of evenly-spaced beats, each group having at least one accented and one non-accented beat. The strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure.  Two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical measure:  (1) A group of even beats (or pulses), always felt, though not always actually sounded, one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest;  (2) Certain rhythmic figures ([Illustration], etc.) which form the actual musical content of these groups.       The student will note the essential difference between rhythm      and measure. Rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a      series of beats (or pulses), while measure is the grouping of      these beats according to some specified system. In listening      to a piece of music, two hearers A and B may feel the _rhythm_      equally strongly, but A may subjectively group the beats      into--_one_, two | _one_, two |--etc., while B feels the      groups as--_one_, two, _three_, four | _one_, two, _three_,      four |--etc. Rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing,      inherent in the music itself, while measure is to a certain      extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have      adopted for practical purposes.  98. In _syncopation_ the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure. Syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents, _i.e._, accenting a beat that is usually not accented. Thus _e.g._, in Fig. 56, measure _one_ has the regular system of accents normally found in four-quarter-measure, (strong accent on one, secondary accent on three); but measure _three_ has only one accent, and it falls on the second beat.  [Illustration: Fig. 56.]  99. Measures are usually classified as _simple_ and _compound_. A _simple measure_ is one which has but a single accent, _i.e._, the measure cannot be divided into smaller constituent groups. There are two main classes of simple measures, two-beat measure, and three-beat measure. A _compound measure_ is (as its name implies) one made up by combining two or more simple measures, or by the elaboration of a single measure (in slow tempo) into several constituent groups. The principal compound measures are four-beat and six-beat, both being referred to as compound-duple measures. Five-beat, seven-beat, nine-beat, and twelve-beat measures are also classified as compound measures.       An English writer[23] classifies measures as duple, triple, or      quadruple, specifying that a simple measure is one in which      each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided      into halves ([Illustration] etc.) and that a compound measure      is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted-note,      whose value can be divided into three parts, ([Illustration]).      There is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as      to the meaning of the words _simple_ and _compound_ when      applied in this connection, the principal question at issue      being whether four-beat measure is an individual variety, or      whether it is a variety compounded out of two-beat measures,      either by placing two of these in a group or by the      elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats,      as is often necessary in slow tempi. Perhaps the easiest way      out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true--but      in different compositions. That is, it is frequently      impossible to tell whether a composition that is being      listened to is in two-beat, or in four-beat measure; and yet      it _is_ sometimes possible so to discriminate. Since, however,      one cannot in the majority of cases distinguish between      two-beat and four-beat measures, it will probably be best to      leave the original classification intact and regard four-beat      measure as a compound variety.  [Footnote 23: Pearse--Rudiments of Musical Knowledge, p. 37.]  100. The _commonest varieties of measure_ are:       1. _Duple_ (sometimes called even measure, or even time), in      which there are two beats, the first one being accented.      Examples of duple measure are 2/4, 2/8, 2/2, two-quarter,[24]      two-eighth, and two-half measure, respectively.       [Footnote 24: For explanation of terminology, see p. 48, Sec.      106.]       2. _Triple_, (the old perfect measure), in which there are      three beats, the first one being accented, the second and      third unaccented. Examples are 3/8, 3/4, 3/2, three-eighth,      three-quarter, and three-half measure, respectively.       3. _Quadruple_, in which there are four beats, the first and      third being accented (primary accent on _one_, secondary      accent on _three_), the second and fourth unaccented. (See      note above, under Sec. 99.)       4. _Sextuple_, in which there are six beats, the first and      fourth being accented, the others not. In rapid tempi this is      always taken as compound duple measure, a dotted quarter note      having a beat. It will be noted that the two measures      [Illustration] are identical in effect with [Illustration].  101. Other varieties of measure sometimes found are 9/8 and 12/8, but these are practically always taken as three-beat and four-beat measures respectively, being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet. [Illustration] is identical in effect with [Illustration].  102. _Quintuple_ (five-beat) and _septuple_ (seven-beat) measures are occasionally met with, but these are rare and will always be sporadic. The five-beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two, or of two and three (sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition), while the seven-beat measure is taken in groups of four and three, or of three and four.  103. The sign [common-time symbol] is usually understood to mean four-quarter measure, and the sign [cut-time symbol], two-half measure, but usage varies somewhat, and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four-half measure. It may safely be said however that the sign [cut-time symbol] always indicates that a half-note has a beat.

September was again at hand, and the cadets at Fardale Military Academy had broken camp, and returned to barracks.  For all of past differences, which had been finally settled between them--for all that they had once been bitter enemies, and were by disposition and development as radically opposite as the positive and negative points of a magnetic needle, Frank Merriwell and Bartley Hodge had chosen to room together.  There was to be no more \"herding\" in fours, and so Barney Mulloy, the Irish lad, and Hans Dunnerwust, the Dutch boy, were assigned to another room.  Like Hodge, Barney and Hans were Frank Merriwell's stanch friends and admirers.  They were ready to do anything for the jolly young plebe, who had become popular at the academy, and thus won both friends and foes among the older cadets.  Barney was shrewd and ready-witted, while Hans, for all of his speech and his blundering ways, was much brighter than he appeared.  Still being plebes, Merriwell and Hodge had been assigned to the \"cock-loft\" of the third division, which meant the top floor on the north side of the barracks--the sunless side.  The other sides, and the lower floors, with the exception of the first, were reserved for the older cadets.  Their room contained two alcoves, or bedrooms, at the end opposite the door.  These alcoves were made by a simple partition that separated one side from the other, but left the bedrooms open to the rest of the room.  Against the walls in the alcoves stood two light iron bedsteads, with a single mattress on each, carefully folded back during the day, and made up only after tattoo.  The rest of the bedding was carefully and systematically piled on the mattresses.  In the partitions were rows of iron hooks, on which their clothing must be placed in regular order, overcoats to the front, then rubber coats, uniform coats, jackets, trousers, and underclothing following, with a bag for soiled clothing at the rear.  On the broad wooden bar that ran across the front of these alcoves, near the ceiling, the names of the cadets who occupied the bedrooms were posted, so inspecting officers could tell at a glance who occupied the beds.  At the front of the partition the washstand was placed, with the bucket of water, dipper, and washbowl, which must always be kept in a certain order, with the washbowl inverted, and the soapdish on top of it.  Rifles were kept in the rack, barrels to the front, with dress hats on the shelf, and a mirror in the middle of the mantelshelf. Accoutrements and forage saps were hung on certain hooks, and clothing and other things allowable and necessary were always to be kept in an unvarying order on a set of open-faced shelves.  The broom and slop-bucket were to be deposited behind the door, the chairs against the table, when not in use, and the table against the wall opposite the fireplace.  At the foot of each bed the shoes were placed in a line, neatly dusted, with toes to the front.  It was required that the room should be constantly kept in perfect order, and Merriwell and Hodge were called on to take turns, week and week about, at being orderly, and the name of the one responsible for the appearance of the room was placed on the orderly board, hung to the front of the alcove partition.  Back of the door was another board, on which each was required to post his hours of recitation, and to account for his absence from the room at any inspection.  In fact, a rigid effort was made at Fardale to imitate in every possible way the regulations and requirements enforced at West Point, and it was the boast that the school was, in almost every particular, identical with our great Military Academy.  Of course, it was impossible to enforce the rules as rigidly as they are at the Point, for the cadets at Fardale were, as a class, far younger, and the disgrace of expulsion or failure in any way was not to be compared with that attending unfortunates at the school where youths are graduated into actual service as officers of the United States army.  Many of the cadets at Fardale had been sent there by parents who could not handle them at home, and who had hoped the discipline they would receive at a military school would serve to tone down their wildness. Thus it will be seen that many harum-scarum fellows got into the school, and that they could not readily be compelled to conform to the rules and requirements.  For all that Frank Merriwell was a jolly, fun-loving fellow, he was naturally orderly and neat, so that it seemed very little effort for him to do his part in keeping the room in order.  On the other hand, Bartley Hodge was naturally careless, and he had a persistent way of displacing things that annoyed Frank, although the latter said little about it at first.  Whenever the inspecting officer found anything wrong about the room, he simply glanced at the orderly board, and down went the demerit against the lad whose name was posted there.  It made no difference who had left a chair out of place, hung a coat where it should not be, or failed to invert the washbowl, the room orderly had to assume the responsibility.  Now, it was the last thing in the world that Hodge could wish to injure Merriwell, but three times in Frank's first week as room orderly he was reported for things he could not help, and for which Bart was entirely responsible.  Merriwell had risen to the first section in recitation at the very start, while Hodge, who had been placed in the third, was soon relegated to the second.  Frank was trying to curb his almost unbounded inclination for mischief, and he was studying assiduously.  On the other hand, while Hodge did not seem at all mischievous by nature, he detested study, and he was inclined to spend the time when he should have been \"digging,\" in reading some story, or in idly yawning and wishing the time away.  One day, after having taken his third demerit on his roommate's account, the inspector having detected tobacco smoke in the room, Frank said:  \"Why don't you swear off on cigarettes, Bart?  They don't do a fellow any good, and they are pretty sure to get him into trouble here at the academy.\"  Hodge was in anything but a pleasant frame of mind, and he instantly retorted:  \"I know what you mean.  You are orderly, and I ought to have spoken up and told the inspector I had been smoking.  I didn't know what it was he put down, but I'll go and confess my crime now.\"  He sprang up petulantly, but Frank's hand dropped on his arm, and Merriwell quietly said:  \"Don't go off angry, old man.  You know I don't want you to do anything of the sort.  I will take my medicine when I am orderly, and I know you will do the same when it comes your turn.\"  \"Well, I didn't know----\" began Bart, in a somewhat sulky manner.  \"You ought to know pretty well by this time.  I am not much given to kicking or growling, but I do want to have a sober talk with you, and I hope you will not fire up at anything I say.\"  \"All right; go ahead,\" said Hodge, throwing himself wearily into a chair, and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets.  \"I'll listen to your sermon.\"  \"It isn't to be a sermon.  You should know I am not the kind of a fellow to preach.\"  \"That's so.  Don't mind me.  Drive ahead.\"  \"First, I want to ask how it is you happened to let yourself be put back in recitations?\"  \"Oh, Old Gunn just put me back--that's all.\"  \"But you are fully as good a scholar as I am, and you could have gone ahead into the first section if you had braced up.\"  \"Perhaps so.\"  \"I know it.  You do not study.\"  \"What's the use of boning all the time!  I wasn't cut out for it.\"  \"That's the only way to get ahead here.\"  \"I don't care much about getting ahead.  All I want is to pull through and graduate.  Then I can go to college if I wish.  These fellows who get the idea that they must dig, dig, dig here, just as they say they do at West Point, give me a pain.  What is there to dig for?  We're not working for commissions in the army.\""]]]
