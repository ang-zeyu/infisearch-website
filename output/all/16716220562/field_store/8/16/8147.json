He is a modern, yet not very recent addition, the fowler, as is shown by the fact that he carries a flint-lock fowling-piece. Drumming and fifing being absolute essentials to every sort of Provençal festivity, a conspicuous figure always is found playing on a _tambourin_ and _galoubet_. Itinerant knife-grinders are an old institution here, and in some obscure way--possibly because of their thievish propensities--are associated intimately with the devil; and so there is either a knife-grinder simple, or a devil with a knife-grinder's wheel. Of old it was the custom for the women to carry distaffs and to spin out thread as they went to and from the fields or along the roads (just as the women nowadays knit as they walk), and therefore a spinning-woman always is of the company. Because child-stealing was not uncommon here formerly, and because gypsies still are plentiful, there are three gypsies lurking about the inn all ready to steal the Christ-Child away. As the inn-keeper naturally would come out to investigate the cause of the commotion in his stable-yard, he is found, with the others, lantern in hand. And, finally, there is a group of women bearing as gifts to the Christ-Child the essentials of the Christmas feast: codfish, chickens, carde, ropes of garlic, eggs, and the great Christmas cakes, _poumpo_ and _fougasso_.  Many other figures may be, and often are, added to the group--of which one of the most delightful is the Turk who makes a solacing present of his pipe to Saint Joseph; but all of these which I have named have come to be now quite as necessary to a properly made crèche as are the few which are taken direct from the Bible narrative: and the congregation surely is one of the quaintest that ever poetry and simplicity together devised!  In Provençal the diminutive of saint is _santoun_; and it is as santouns that all the personages of the crèche--including the whole of the purely human and animal contingent, and even the knife-grinding devil--are known. They are of various sizes--the largest, used in churches, being from two to three feet high--and in quality of all degrees: ranging downward from real magnificence (such as may be seen in the seventeenth-century Neapolitan crèche in Room V. of the Musée de Cluny) to the rough little clay figures two or three inches high in common household use throughout Provence. These last, sold by thousands at Christmas time, are as crude as they well can be: pressed in rude moulds, dried (not baked), and painted with glaring colours, with a little gilding added in the case of Jehovah and the angels and the Kings.  For two centuries or more the making of clay santouns has been a notable industry in Marseille. It is largely a hereditary trade carried on by certain families inhabiting that ancient part of the city, the Quarter of Saint-Jean, which lies to the south of the Vieux Port. The figures sell for the merest trifle, the cheapest for one or two sous, yet the Santoun Fair--held annually in December in booths set up in the Cour-du-Chapitre and in the Allée-des-Capucins--is of a real commercial importance; and is also--what with the oddly whimsical nature of its merchandise, and the vast enjoyment of the children under parental or grand-parental convoy who are its patrons--the very gayest sight in that city of which gayety is the dominant characteristic the whole year round.   VII  Not until \"the day of the Kings,\" the Feast of the Epiphany, is the crèche completed. Then are added to the group the figures of the three Kings--the Magi, as we call them in English: along with their gallant train of servitors, and the hump-backed camels on which they have ridden westward to Bethlehem guided by the Star. The Provençal children believe that they come at sunset, in pomp and splendour, riding in from the outer country, and on through the street of the village, and in through the church door, to do homage before the manger in the transept where the Christ-Child lies. And the children believe that it may be seen, this noble procession, if only they may have the good fortune to hit upon the road along which the royal progress to their village is to be made. But Mistral has told about all this far better than I can tell about it, and I shall quote here, by his permission, a page or two from the \"Memoirs\" which he is writing, slowly and lovingly, in the between-whiles of the making of his songs:      \"To-morrow's the festival of the Kings. This evening they arrive. If     you want to see them, little ones, go quickly to meet them--and take     presents for them, and for their pages, and for the poor camels who     have come so far!\"      That was what, in my time, the mothers used to say on the eve of     Epiphany--and, _zòu!_ all the children of the village would be off     together to meet \"les Rois Mages,\" who were coming with their pages     and their camels and the whole of their glittering royal suite to     adore the Christ-Child in our church in Maillane! All of us     together, little chaps with curly hair, pretty little girls, our     sabots clacking, off we would go along the Arles road, our hearts     thrilling with joy, our eyes full of visions. In our hands we would     carry, as we had been bidden, our presents: fougasso for the Kings,     figs for the pages, sweet hay for the tired camels who had come so     far.      On we would go through the cold of dying day, the sun, over beyond     the Rhône, dipping toward the Cévennes; leafless trees, red in low     sun-rays; black lines of cypress; in the fields an old woman with a     fagot on her head; beside the road an old man scratching under the     hedge for snails.      \"Where are you going, little ones?\"      \"We are going to meet the Kings!\" And on we would run proudly along     the white road, while the shrewd north wind blew sharp behind us,     until our old church tower would drop away and be hidden behind the     trees. We could see far, far down the wide straight road, but it     would be bare! In the cold of the winter evening all would be dumb.     Then we would meet a shepherd, wrapped in his long brown cloak and     leaning on his staff, a silhouette against the western sky.      \"Where are you going, little ones?\"      \"We are going to meet the Kings! Can you tell us if they are far     off?\"      \"Ah, the Kings. Certainly. They are over there behind the cypresses.     They are coming. You will see them soon.\"      On we would run to meet the Kings so near, with our fougasso and our     figs and our hay for the hungry camels. The day would be waning     rapidly, the sun dropping down into a great cloud-bank above the     mountains, the wind nipping us more shrewdly as it grew still more     chill. Our hearts also would be chilling. Even the bravest of us     would be doubting a little this adventure upon which we were bound.      [Illustration: THE PASSING OF THE KINGS]      Then, of a sudden, a flood of radiant glory would be about us, and     from the dark cloud above the mountains would burst forth a     splendour of glowing crimson and of royal purple and of glittering     gold!      \"Les Rois Mages! Les Rois Mages!\" we would cry. \"They are coming!     They are here at last!\"      But it would be only the last rich dazzle of the sunset. Presently     it would vanish. The owls would be hooting. The chill night would be     settling down upon us, out there in the bleak country, sorrowful,     alone. Fear would take hold of us. To keep up our courage a little,     we would nibble at the figs which we had hoped to give to the pages,     at the fougasso which we had hoped to present to the Kings. As for     the hay for the hungry camels, we would throw it away. Shivering in     the wintry dusk, we would return sadly to our homes.      And when we reached our homes again our mothers would ask: \"Well,     did you see them, the Kings?\"      \"No; they passed by on the other side of the Rhône, behind the     mountains.\"      \"But what road did you take?\"      \"The road to Arles.\"      \"Ah, my poor child! The Kings don't come that way. They come from     the East. You should have gone out to meet them on the road to     Saint-Remy. And what a sight you have missed! Oh, how beautiful it     was when they came marching into Maillane--the drums, the trumpets,     the pages, the camels! _Mon Dieu_, what a commotion! What a sight it     was! And now they are in the church, making their homage before the     manger in which the little Christ-Child lies. But never mind; after     supper you shall see them all.\"      Then we would sup quickly, and so be off to the church, crowded with     all Maillane. Barely would we be entered there when the organ would     begin, at first softly and then bursting forth formidably, all our     people singing with it, with the superb noël:                    In the early morning                   I met a train         Of three great Kings who were going on a journey!      High up before the altar, directly above the manger in which the     Christ-Child was lying, would be the glittering _bello estello_;     and making their homage before the manger would be the Kings whom it     had guided thither from the East: old white-bearded King Melchior     with his gift of incense; gallant young King Gaspard with his gift     of treasure; black King Balthazar the Moor with his gift of myrrh.     How reverently we would gaze on them, and how we would admire the     brave pages who carried the trains of their long mantles, and the     hump-backed camels whose heads towered high above Saint Mary and     Saint Joseph and the ox and the ass.      Yes, there they were at last--the Kings!  Many and many a time in the after years have I gone a-walking on the Arles road at nightfall on the Eve of the Kings. It is the same--but not the same. The sun, over beyond the Rhône, is dipping toward the Cévennes; the leafless trees are red in the low sun-rays; across"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19587"],["title","The Christmas Kalends of Provence (#6)"],["body"," fields stretch the black lines of cypress; even the old man, as long ago, is scratching in the hedge by the roadside for snails. And when darkness comes quickly, with the sun's setting, the owls hoot as of old.  But in the radiant glory of the sunset I no longer see the dazzle and the splendour of the Kings!  \"Which way went they, the Kings?\"  \"Behind the mountains!\"   VIII  In the morning of the day preceding Christmas a lurking, yet ill-repressed, excitement pervaded the Château and all its dependencies. In the case of the Vidame and Misè Fougueiroun the excitement did not even lurk: it blazed forth so openly that they were as a brace of comets--bustling violently through our universe and dragging into their erratic wakes, away from normal orbits, the whole planetary system of the household and all the haply intrusive stars.  With my morning coffee came the explanation of a quite impossible smell of frying dough-nuts which had puzzled me on the preceding day: a magnificent golden-brown _fougasso_, so perfect of its kind that any Provençal of that region--though he had come upon it in the sandy wastes of Sahara--would have known that its creator was Misè Fougueiroun. To compare the _fougasso_ with our homely dough-nut does it injustice. It is a large flat open-work cake--a grating wrought in dough--an inch or so in thickness, either plain or sweetened or salted, fried delicately in the best olive-oil of Aix or Maussane. It is made throughout the winter, but its making at Christmas time is of obligation; and the custom obtains among the women--though less now than of old--of sending a _fougasso_ as a Christmas gift to each of their intimates. As this custom had in it something more than a touch of vainglorious emulation, I well can understand why it has fallen into desuetude in the vicinity of Vièlmur--where Misè Fougueiroun's inspired kitchening throws all other cook-work hopelessly into the shade. As I ate the \"horns\" (as its fragments are called) of my _fougasso_ that morning, dipping them in my coffee according to the prescribed custom, I was satisfied that it deserved its high place in the popular esteem.  When I joined the Vidame below stairs I found him under such stress of Christmas excitement that he actually forgot his usual morning suggestion--made always with an off-hand freshness, as though the matter were entirely new--that we should take a turn along the lines of the Roman Camp. He was fidgeting back and forth between the hall (our usual place of morning meeting) and the kitchen: torn by his conflicting desires to attend upon me, his guest, and to take his accustomed part in the friendly ceremony that was going on below. Presently he compromised the divergencies of the situation, though with some hesitation, by taking me down with him into Misè Fougueiroun's domain--where he became frankly cheerful when he found that I was well received.  Although the morning still was young, work on the estate had been ended for the day, and about the door of the kitchen more than a score of labourers were gathered: all with such gay looks as to show that something of a more than ordinarily joyous nature was in train. Among them I recognized the young fellow whom we had met with his wife carrying away the yule-log; and found that all of them were workmen upon the estate who--either being married or having homes within walking distance--were to be furloughed for the day. This was according to the Provençal custom that Christmas must be spent by one's own fire-side; and it also was according to Provençal custom that they were not suffered to go away with empty hands.  Misè Fougueiroun--a plump embodiment of Benevolence--stood beside a table on which was a great heap of her own _fougasso_, and big baskets filled with dried figs and almonds and celery, and a genial battalion of bottles standing guard over all. One by one the vassals were called up--there was a strong flavour of feudalism in it all--and to each, while the Vidame wished him a \"_Bòni fèsto!_\" the housekeeper gave his Christmas portion: a _fougasso_, a double-handful each of figs and almonds, a stalk of celery, and a bottle of _vin cue_[2]--the cordial that is used for the libation of the yule-log and for the solemn yule-cup; and each, as he received his portion, made his little speech of friendly thanks--in several cases most gracefully turned--and then was off in a hurry for his home. Most of them were dwellers in the immediate neighbourhood; but four or five had before them walks of more than twenty miles, with the same distance to cover in returning the next day. But great must be the difficulty or the distance that will keep a Provençal from his own people and his own hearth-stone at Christmas-tide!  In illustration of this home-seeking trait, I have from my friend Mistral the story that his own grandfather used to tell regularly every year when all the family was gathered about the yule-fire on Christmas Eve:  It was back in the Revolutionary times, and Mistral the grandfather--only he was not a grandfather then, but a mettlesome young soldier of two-and-twenty--was serving with the Army of the Pyrénées, down on the borders of Spain. December was well on, but the season was open--so open that he found one day a tree still bearing oranges. He filled a basket with the fruit and carried it to the Captain of his company. It was a gift for a king, down there in those hard times, and the Captain's eyes sparkled. \"Ask what thou wilt, _mon brave_,\" he said, \"and if I can give it to thee it shall be thine.\"  Quick as a flash the young fellow answered: \"Before a cannon-ball cuts me in two, Commandant, I should like to go to Provence and help once more to lay the yule-log in my own home. Let me do that!\"  Now that was a serious matter. But the Captain had given his word, and the word of a soldier of the Republic was better than the oath of a king. Therefore he sat down at his camp-table and wrote:      Army of the Eastern Pyrénées, December 12, 1793.      We, Perrin, Captain of Military Transport, give leave to the citizen     François Mistral, a brave Republican soldier, twenty-two years old,     five feet six inches high, chestnut hair and eyebrows, ordinary     nose, mouth the same, round chin, medium forehead, oval face, to go     back into his province, to go all over the Republic, and, if he     wants to, to go to the devil!  \"With an order like that in his pocket,\" said Mistral, \"you can fancy how my grandfather put the leagues behind him; and how joyfully he reached Maillane on the lovely Christmas Eve, and how there was danger of rib-cracking from the hugging that went on. But the next day it was another matter. News of his coming had flown about the town, and the Mayor sent for him.  \"'In the name of the law, citizen,' the Mayor demanded, 'why hast thou left the army?'  \"Now my grandfather was a bit of a wag, and so--with never a word about his famous pass--he answered: 'Well, you see I took a fancy to come and spend my Christmas here in Maillane.'  \"At that the Mayor was in a towering passion. 'Very good, citizen,' he cried. 'Other people also may take fancies--and mine is that thou shalt explain this fancy of thine before the Military Tribunal at Tarascon. Off with him there!'  \"And then away went my grandfather between a brace of gendarmes, who brought him in no time before the District Judge: a savage old fellow in a red cap, with a beard up to his eyes, who glared at him as he asked: 'Citizen, how is it that thou hast deserted thy flag?'  \"Now my grandfather, who was a sensible man, knew that a joke might be carried too far; therefore he whipped out his pass and presented it, and so in a moment set everything right.  \"'Good, very good, citizen!' said old Redcap. 'This is as it should be. Thy Captain says that thou art a brave soldier of the Republic, and that is the best that the best of us can be. With a pass like that in thy pocket thou canst snap thy fingers at all the mayors in Provence; and the devil himself had best be careful--shouldst thou go down that way, as thy pass permits thee--how he trifles with a brave soldier of France!'  \"But my grandfather did not try the devil's temper,\" Mistral concluded. \"He was satisfied to stay in his own dear home until the Day of the Kings was over, and then he went back to his command.\"   IX  The day dragged a little when we had finished in the kitchen with the giving of Christmas portions and the last of the farm-hands, calling back \"_Bòni fèsto!_,\" had gone away. For the womenkind, of course, there was a world to do; and Misè Fougueiroun whisked us out of her dominions with a pretty plain statement that our company was less desirable than our room. But for the men there was only idle waiting until night should come.  As for the Vidame--who is a fiery fume of a little old gentleman, never happy unless in some way busily employed--this period of stagnation was so galling that in sheer pity I mounted him upon his hobby and set him to galloping away. 'Twas an easy matter, and the stimulant that I administered was rather dangerously strong: for I brought up the blackest beast in the whole herd of his abominations by asking him if there were not some colour of reason in the belief that Marius lay not at Vièlmur but at Glanum--now Saint-Remy-de-Provence--behind the lines of Roman wall which exist there to this day.  So far as relieving the strain of the situation was concerned, my expedient was a complete success; but the storm that I raised was like to have given the Vidame such an attack of bilious indigestion begotten of anger as would have spoiled the Great Supper for him; and as for myself, I was overwhelmed for some hours by his avalanche of words. But the long walk that we took in the afternoon, that he might give me convincing proof of the soundness of his archæological theories, fortunately set matters right again; and when we returned in the late day to the Château my old friend had"]]]
