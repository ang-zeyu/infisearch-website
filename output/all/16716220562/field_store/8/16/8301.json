I was nearly back to the spaceport by now, across from the street-shrine at the edge of the square. It was here that the little toy-seller had vanished. But it was exactly like a thousand, a hundred thousand other such street-shrines on Wolf, a smudge of incense reeking and stinking before the squatting image of Nebran, the Toad God whose face and symbol are everywhere on Wolf. I stared for a moment at the ugly idol, then slowly moved away.  The lighted curtains of the spaceport cafe attracted my attention and I went inside. A few spaceport personnel in storm gear were drinking coffee at the counter, a pair of furred _chaks_, lounging beneath the mirrors at the far end, and a trio of Dry-towners, rangy, weathered men in crimson and blue shirt cloaks, were standing at a wall shelf, eating Terran food with aloof dignity.  In my business clothes I felt more conspicuous than the _chaks_. What place had a civilian here, between the uniforms of the spacemen and the colorful brilliance of the Dry-towners?  A snub-nosed girl with alabaster hair came to take my order. I asked for _jaco_ and bunlets, and carried the food to a wall shelf near the Dry-towners. Their dialect fell soft and familiar on my ears. One of them, without altering the expression on his face or the easy tone of his voice, began to make elaborate comments on my entrance, my appearance, my ancestry and probably personal habits, all defined in the colorfully obscene dialect of Shainsa.  That had happened before. The Wolfan sense of humor is only half-human. The finest joke is to criticize and insult a stranger, preferably an Earthman, to his very face, in an unknown language, perfectly deadpan. In my civilian clothes I was obviously fair game.  A look or gesture of resentment would have lost face and dignity--what the Dry-towners call their _kihar_--permanently. I leaned over and remarked in their own dialect that I would, at some future and unspecified time, appreciate the opportunity to return their compliments.  By rights they should have laughed, made some barbed remark about my command of language and crossed their hands in symbol of a jest decently reversed on themselves. Then we would have bought each other a drink, and that would be that.  But it didn't happen that way. Not this time. The tallest of the three whirled, upsetting his drink in the process. I heard its thin shatter through the squeal of the alabaster-haired girl, as a chair crashed over. They faced me three abreast, and one of them fumbled in the clasp of his shirtcloak.  I edged backward, my own hand racing up for a skean I hadn't carried in six years, and fronted them squarely, hoping I could face down the prospect of a roughhouse. They wouldn't kill me, this close to the HQ, but at least I was in for an unpleasant mauling. I couldn't handle three men; and if nerves were this taut in the Kharsa, I might get knifed. Quite by accident, of course.  The _chaks_ moaned and gibbered. The Dry-towners glared at me and I tensed for the moment when their steady stare would explode into violence.  Then I became aware that they were gazing, not at me, but at something or someone behind me. The skeans snicked back into the clasps of their cloaks.  Then they broke rank, turned and ran. They _ran_, blundering into stools, leaving havoc of upset benches and broken crockery in their wake. One man barged into the counter, swore and ran on, limping. I let my breath go. Something had put the fear of God into those brutes, and it wasn't my own ugly mug. I turned and saw the girl.  She was slight, with waving hair like spun black glass, circled with faint tracery of stars. A black glass belt bound her narrow waist like clasped hands, and her robe, stark white, bore an ugly embroidery across the breasts, the flat sprawl of a conventionalized Toad God, Nebran. Her features were delicate, chiseled, pale; a Dry-town face, all human, all woman, but set in an alien and unearthly repose. The great eyes gleamed red. They were fixed, almost unseeing, but the crimson lips were curved with inhuman malice.  She stood motionless, looking at me as if wondering why I had not run with the others. In half a second, the smile flickered off and was replaced by a startled look of--recognition?  Whoever and whatever she was, she had saved me a mauling. I started to phrase formal thanks, then broke off in astonishment. The cafe had emptied and we were entirely alone. Even the _chaks_ had leaped through an open window--I saw the whisk of a disappearing tail.  We stood frozen, looking at one another while the Toad God sprawled across her breasts rose and fell for half a dozen breaths.  Then I took one step forward, and she took one step backward, at the same instant. In one swift movement she was outside in the dark street. It took me only an instant to get into the street after her, but as I stepped across the door there was a little stirring in the air, like the rising of heat waves across the salt flats at noon. Then the street-shrine was empty, and nowhere was there any sign of the girl. She had vanished. She simply was not there.  I gaped at the empty shrine. She had stepped inside and vanished, like a wraith of smoke, like--  --Like the little toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa.  There were eyes in the street again and, becoming aware of where I was, I moved away. The shrines of Nebran are on every corner of Wolf, but this is one instance when familiarity does not breed contempt. The street was dark and seemed empty, but it was packed with all the little noises of living. I was not unobserved. And meddling with a street-shrine would be just as dangerous as the skeans of my three loud-mouthed Dry-town roughnecks.  I turned and crossed the square for the last time, turning toward the loom of the spaceship, filing the girl away as just another riddle of Wolf I'd never solve.  How wrong I was!     CHAPTER THREE   From the spaceport gates, exchanging brief greetings with the guards, I took a last look at the Kharsa. For a minute I toyed with the notion of just disappearing down one of those streets. It's not hard to disappear on Wolf, if you know how. And I knew, or had known once. Loyalty to Terra? What had Terra given me except a taste of color and adventure, out there in the Dry-towns, and then taken it away again?  If an Earthman is very lucky and very careful, he lasts about ten years in Intelligence. I had had two years more than my share. I still knew enough to leave my Terran identity behind like a worn-out jacket. I could seek out Rakhal, settle our blood-feud, see Juli again....  How could I see Juli again? As her husband's murderer? No other way. Blood-feud on Wolf is a terrible and elaborate ritual of the code duello. And once I stepped outside the borders of Terran law, sooner or later Rakhal and I would meet. And one of us would die.  I looked back, just once, at the dark rambling streets away from the square. Then I turned toward the blue-white lights that hurt my eyes, and the starship that loomed, huge and hateful, before me.  A steward in white took my fingerprint and led me to a coffin-sized chamber. He brought me coffee and sandwiches--I hadn't, after all, eaten in the spaceport cafe--then got me into the skyhook and strapped me, deftly and firmly, into the acceleration cushions, tugging at the Garensen belts until I ached all over. A long needle went into my arm--the narcotic that would keep me safely drowsy all through the terrible tug of interstellar acceleration.  Doors clanged, buzzers vibrated lower down in the ship, men tramped the corridors calling to one another in the language of the spaceports. I understood one word in four. I shut my eyes, not caring. At the end of the trip there would be another star, another world, another language. Another life.  I had spent all my adult life on Wolf. Juli had been a child under the red star. But it was a pair of wide crimson eyes and black hair combed into ringlets like spun black glass that went down with me into the bottomless pit of sleep....         *       *       *       *       *  Someone was shaking me.  \"Ah, come on, Cargill. Wake up, man. Shake your boots!\"  My mouth, foul-tasting and stiff, fumbled at the shapes of words. \"Wha' happened? Wha' y' want?\" My eyes throbbed. When I got them open I saw two men in black leathers bending over me. We were still inside gravity.  \"Get out of the skyhook. You're coming with us.\"  \"Wha'--\" Even through the layers of the sedative, that got to me. Only a criminal, under interstellar law, can be removed from a passage-paid starship once he has formally checked in on board. I was legally, at this moment, on my \"planet of destination.\"  \"I haven't been charged--\"  \"Did I say you had?\" snapped one man.  \"Shut up, he's doped,\" the other said hurriedly. \"Look,\" he continued, pronouncing every word loudly and distinctly, \"get up now, and come with us. The co-ordinator will hold up blastoff if we don't get off in three minutes, and Operations will scream. Come on, please.\"  Then I was stumbling along the lighted, empty corridor, swaying between the two men, foggily realizing the crew must think me a fugitive caught trying to leave the planet.  The locks dilated. A uniformed spaceman watched us, fussily regarding a chronometer. He fretted. \"The dispatcher's office--\"  \"We're doing the best we can,\" the Spaceforce man said. \"Can you walk, Cargill?\"  I could, though my feet were a little shaky on the ladders. The violet moonlight had deepened to mauve, and gusty winds spun tendrils of grit across my face. The Spaceforce men shepherded me, one on either side, to the gateway.  \"What the hell is all this? Is something wrong with my pass?\"  The guard shook his head. \"How would I know? Magnusson put out the order, take it up with him.\"  \"Believe me,\" I muttered, \"I will.\"  They looked at each other. \"Hell,\" said one, \"he's not under arrest, we don't have to haul him"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],["title","The Door Through Space (#3)"],["body","like a convict. Can you walk all right now, Cargill? You know where the Secret Service office is, don't you? Floor 38. The Chief wants you, and make it fast.\"  I knew it made no sense to ask questions, they obviously knew no more than I did. I asked anyhow.  \"Are they holding the ship for me? I'm supposed to be leaving on it.\"  \"Not that one,\" the guard answered, jerking his head toward the spaceport. I looked back just in time to see the dust-dimmed ship leap upward, briefly whitened in the field searchlights, and vanish into the surging clouds above.  My head was clearing fast, and anger speeded up the process. The HQ building was empty in the chill silence of just before dawn. I had to rout out a dozing elevator operator, and as the lift swooped upward my anger rose with it. I wasn't working for Magnusson any more. What right had he, or anybody, to grab me off an outbound starship like a criminal? By the time I barged into his office, I was spoiling for a fight.  The Secret Service office was full of grayish-pink morning and yellow lights left on from the night before. Magnusson, at his desk, looked as if he'd slept in his rumpled uniform. He was a big bull of a man, and his littered desk looked, as always, like the track of a typhoon in the salt flats.  The clutter was weighted down, here and there, with solidopic cubes of the five Magnusson youngsters, and as usual, Magnusson was fiddling with one of the cubes. He said, not looking up, \"Sorry to pull this at the last minute, Race. There was just time to put out a pull order and get you off the ship, but no time to explain.\"  I glared at him. \"Seems I can't even get off the planet without trouble! You raised hell all the time I was here, but when I try to leave--what is this, anyhow? I'm sick of being shoved around!\"  Magnusson made a conciliating gesture. \"Wait until you hear--\" he began, and broke off, looking at someone who was sitting in the chair in front of his desk, somebody whose back was turned to me. Then the person twisted and I stopped cold, blinking and wondering if this were a hallucination and I'd wake up in the starship's skyhook, far out in space.  Then the woman cried, \"Race, _Race_! Don't you know me?\"  I took one dazed step and another. Then she flew across the space between us, her thin arms tangling around my neck, and I caught her up, still disbelieving.  \"_Juli!_\"  \"Oh, Race, I thought I'd die when Mack told me you were leaving tonight. It's been the only thing that's kept me alive, knowing--knowing I'd see you.\" She sobbed and laughed, her face buried in my shoulder.  I let her cry for a minute, then held my sister at arm's length. For a moment I had forgotten the six years that lay between us. Now I saw them, all of them, printed plain on her face. Juli had been a pretty girl. Six years had fined her face into beauty, but there was tension in the set of her shoulders, and her gray eyes had looked on horrors.  She looked tiny and thin and unbearably frail under the scanty folds of her fur robe, a Dry-town woman's robe. Her wrists were manacled, the jeweled tight bracelets fastened together by the links of a long fine chain of silvered gilt that clashed a little, thinly, as her hands fell to her sides.  \"What's wrong, Juli? Where's Rakhal?\"  She shivered and now I could see that she was in a state of shock.  \"Gone. He's gone, that's all I know. And--oh, Race, Race, he took Rindy with him!\"  From the tone of her voice I had thought she was sobbing. Now I realized that her eyes were dry; she was long past tears. Gently I unclasped her clenched fingers and put her back in the chair. She sat like a doll, her hands falling to her sides with a thin clash of chains. When I picked them up and laid them in her lap she let them lie there motionless. I stood over her and demanded, \"Who's Rindy?\" She didn't move.  \"My daughter, Race. Our little girl.\"  Magnusson broke in, his voice harsh. \"Well, Cargill, should I have let you leave?\"  \"Don't be a damn fool!\"  \"I was afraid you'd tell the poor kid she had to live with her own mistakes,\" growled Magnusson. \"You're capable of it.\"  For the first time Juli showed a sign of animation. \"I was afraid to come to you, Mack. You never wanted me to marry Rakhal, either.\"  \"Water under the bridge,\" Magnusson grunted. \"And I've got lads of my own, Miss Cargill--Mrs.--\" he stopped in distress, vaguely remembering that in the Dry-towns an improper form of address can be a deadly insult.  But she guessed his predicament.  \"You used to call me Juli, Mack. It will do now.\"  \"You've changed,\" he said quietly. \"Juli, then. Tell Race what you told me. All of it.\"  She turned to me. \"I shouldn't have come for myself--\"  I knew that. Juli was proud, and she had always had the courage to live with her own mistakes. When I first saw her, I knew this wouldn't be anything so simple as the complaint of an abused wife or even an abandoned or deserted mother. I took a chair, watching her and listening.  She began. \"You made a mistake when you turned Rakhal out of the Service, Mack. In his way he was the most loyal man you had on Wolf.\"  Magnusson had evidently not expected her to take this tack. He scowled and looked disconcerted, shifting uneasily in his big chair, but when Juli did not continue, obviously awaiting his answer, he said, \"Juli, he left me no choice. I never knew how his mind worked. That final deal he engineered--have you any idea how much that cost the Service? And have you taken a good look at your brother's face, Juli girl?\"  Juli raised her eyes slowly, and I saw her flinch. I knew how she felt. For three years I had kept my mirror covered, growing an untidy straggle of beard because it hid the scars and saved me the ordeal of facing myself to shave.  Juli whispered, \"Rakhal's is just as bad. Worse.\"  \"That's some satisfaction,\" I said, and Mack stared at us, baffled. \"Even now I don't know what it was all about.\"  \"And you never will,\" I said for the hundredth time. \"We've been over this before. Nobody could understand it unless he'd lived in the Dry-towns. Let's not talk about it. You talk, Juli. What brought you here like this? What about the kid?\"  \"There's no way I can tell you the end without telling you the beginning,\" she said reasonably. \"At first Rakhal worked as a trader in Shainsa.\"  I wasn't surprised. The Dry-towns were the core of Terran trade on Wolf, and it was through their cooperation that Terra existed here peaceably, on a world only half human, or less.  The men of the Dry-towns existed strangely poised between two worlds. They had made dealings with the first Terran ships, and thus gave entrance to the wedge of the Terran Empire. And yet they stood proud and apart. They alone had never yielded to the Terranizing which overtakes all Empire planets sooner or later.  There were no Trade Cities in the Dry-towns; an Earthman who went there unprotected faced a thousand deaths, each one worse than the last. There were those who said that the men of Shainsa and Daillon and Ardcarran had sold the rest of Wolf to the Terrans, to keep the Terrans from their own door.  Even Rakhal, who had worked with Terra since boyhood, had finally come to a point of decision and gone his own way. And it was not Terra's way.  That was what Juli was saying now.  \"He didn't like what Terra was doing on Wolf. I'm not so sure I like it myself--\"  Magnusson interrupted her again. \"Do you know what Wolf was like when we came here? Have you seen the Slave Colony, the Idiot's Village? Your own brother went to Shainsa and routed out The Lisse.\"  \"And Rakhal helped him!\" Juli reminded him. \"Even after he left you, he tried to keep out of things. He could have told them a good deal that would hurt you, after ten years in Intelligence, you know.\"  I knew. It was, although I wasn't going to tell Juli this, one reason why, at the end--during that terrible explosion of violence which no normal Terran mind could comprehend--I had done my best to kill him. We had both known that after this, the planet would not hold the two of us. We could both go on living only by dividing it unevenly. I had been given the slow death of the Terran Zone. And he had all the rest.  \"But he never told them anything! I tell you, he was one of the most loyal--\"  Mack grunted, \"Yeah, he's an angel. Go ahead.\"  She didn't, not immediately. Instead she asked what sounded like an irrelevant question. \"Is it true what he told me? That the Empire has a standing offer of a reward for a working model of a matter transmitter?\"  \"That offer's been standing for three hundred years, Terran reckoning. One million credits cash. Don't tell me he was figuring to invent one?\"  \"I don't think so. But I think he heard rumors about one. He said with that kind of money he could bargain the Terrans right out of Shainsa. That was where it started. He began coming and going at odd times, but he never said any more about it. He wouldn't talk to me at all.\"  \"When was all this?\"  \"About four months ago.\"  \"In other words, just about the time of the riots in Charin.\"  She nodded. \"Yes. He was away in Charin when the Ghost Wind blew, and he came back with knife cuts in his thigh. I asked if he had been mixed-up in the anti-Terran rioting, but he wouldn't tell me. Race, I don't know anything about politics. I don't really care. But just about that time, the Great House in Shainsa changed hands. I'm sure Rakhal had something to do with that.  \"And then--\" Juli twisted her chained hands together in her lap--\"he tried to mix Rindy up in it. It was crazy, awful! He'd brought her some sort of nonhuman toy from one of the lowland towns, Charin I think. It was a weird thing, scared me. But he'd sit Rindy down in the sunlight and have her look into it, and Rindy would gabble all sorts of nonsense about little men and birds and a toymaker.\"  The chains about Juli's wrists clashed as she twisted her hands together. I stared somberly at the fetters. The chain, which was long, did"]]]
