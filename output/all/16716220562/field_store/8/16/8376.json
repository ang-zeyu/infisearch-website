Anita, a little Italian girl, alone has faith in the coming of the good Saint. She is wandering around the ship when all of a sudden, much to her surprise, she hears a mysterious noise in a great big barrel, and who should jump out but little Jack Frost himself. Jack assures her that Santa Claus really is coming to visit the ship, and more than that, he is going to make an especial trip in an air ship! And this is little Anita's secret. The children all fall asleep, but Anita keeps watch for the mysterious aeroplane that will bring joy to every little heart in the steerage, and, sure enough, just a little before midnight Anita and Jack Frost look through a telescope and see the lights of the approaching air ship.  Soon Santa Claus himself is on board, and such a time as he and Anita and jolly Jack Frost have in arranging a wonderful Christmas surprise for the children. As an especial favor the good Saint decides to awaken the children himself very early on Christmas morning. The clock strikes twelve and it is Christmas Day. The bells of merry Christmas are heard chiming in the distance, and Santa Claus and jolly Jack Frost hold a Christmas morning revel with the little immigrant children away down in the steerage of the big vessel.         *       *       *       *       *  SCENE: _The steerage of a large ocean-going vessel.

The ship is sail-ing ver-y fast,      We can't go out to play;      But Christmas Day is com-ing soon,      It is-n't far a-way.       2. We're sail-ing to A-mer-i-ca,      So far a-cross the sea,      We're hap-py lit-tle im-mi-grants,      Our hearts are light and free.       3. We're hap-py lit-tle for-eign-ers,      From far a-cross the way,      But soon we will be cit-i-zens      Of dear old U.S.A.       Then clap, clap, clap to-geth-er,      Clap, clap, a-way;      The steer-age is a hap-py place--      Tomorrow's Christmas Day.]  (_On the words \"clap, clap, clap together,\" the children hold left hand horizontally in front of their chests, palm upward, raising the right hand and bringing it down on the left with a sharp clap._  _Sing the first verse seated around stage. On the first four lines of the second verse nod heads and smile at audience. On the line \"We're happy little immigrants,\" each one points to chest, nods head and smiles broadly._  _For the third verse all rise and stand in couples in small groups all around stage. On the first two lines of the third verse each one faces his partner slightly, nods at him and shakes index finger of right hand at partner. On \"dear, old U.S.A.\" all make a deep bow to audience. After third verse is completed, all form a circle and skip around in time to the music, repeating the third verse. On \"clap, clap, clap together,\" they stand still and clap hands as before. When the song is ended all resume former positions, as at the rise of the curtain, but the boys do not play leapfrog._)  TOMASSO (_seated on floor at C._). Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?  PADDY MIKE (_seated near him, nods his head_). Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.  MEENY (_seated down L., knitting stocking_). The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? (_Nods head._) Sure it is.  SCHWILLIE. Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?  KLINKER. Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  HULDA. That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.  KLINKER. But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?  HULDA. How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.  MEENY. Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful. (SERGIUS, TOMASSO, YAKOB, PADDY MIKE _and_ AH GOO _play jack-stones._)  KLINKER. But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?  KLINKER. Sure. We've been awfully good boys.  HULDA. Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.  MEENY. Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.  BIDDY MARY. Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?  SERGIUS. Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike saw it, too.  PADDY MIKE. Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all. (MIEZE _and_ SANO SAN _turn backs to audience and look over the railing into the water._)  HULDA (_to the twins_). There! Now if you get to see the great big whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't it?  SCHWILLIE. Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they, Klinker?  KLINKER. Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SERGIUS. Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?  HULDA (_astonished_). Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und visits all the little children in Holland.  MEENY (_proudly_). Und in Germany, too. (SERGIUS _goes to_ HULDA.)  KLINKER. Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?  KLINKER. Sure. Und me also.  HULDA (_to_ SERGIUS). On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star. And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor. Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!  KLINKER. Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas fills 'em with candy.  SCHWILLIE. Und we put a leedle bit of hay in our shoes for his good old horsie, Sleipner. Dot makes him happy.  MEENY. In Germany we call him Santa Claus, und he comes riding in a sleigh drawn through the sky mit reindeers. Und we have Christmas trees all lighted mit candles und things, und full of toys und paper stars und angels und apples. But Santa Claus could never get out here in der middle of der ocean. If he did maybe he'd get seasick already, und all der reindeers would get drownded in der water.  SERGIUS (_standing R.C._). In Russia there is an old woman named Babouska who visits all the children on the night before Christmas. She carries a big basket full of good things.  TOMASSO (_seated on floor at C._). In sunny Italy the children all go to midnight church on Christmas Eve, and when we make ourselves awake on Christmas morning, our shoes are all full of candy and chestnuts and figs and oranges. But of course on a big ship like-a this we'll not get-a nothing at all.  KLINKER (_crying_). But I want some presents already.  SCHWILLIE (_crying_). Und me also. I want some presents, too.  KLINKER. Und Saint Nicholas can't come. Oh, oh! He can't get out on the big ocean.  SCHWILLIE. Maybe he could float out on a piece of ice yet. Could he, Hulda?  HULDA. No. I don't think he's much of a floater.  MEENY. If he did it would make him awful seasick.  KLINKER. I wish we was landed in New York yet, so I do.  SCHWILLIE. Where is Anita? She'll know.  HULDA. Yes, Anita will know whether he is coming or not. She knows almost everything.  PADDY MIKE (_standing at rear L._). Here comes Anita now, and sure she's having a grand time, so she is.  ALL (_rising and going to rear, looking off L._). Here she comes. Hurrah for Anita. (_Music: The same as for the Opening Song._)  TOMASSO (_calling_). Anita, Anita, come here quick. We want you.  ANITA (_outside L._). I'm coming. Wait a minute. I'm coming.  _Music swells louder._ ANITA _dances in from L., all sing as she dances around, waving her tambourine._  ALL (_singing to tune of the \"Opening Song\"_).       We're sailing to America,        Away across the sea,      We're happy little immigrants,        Our hearts are light and free.      Then clap, clap, clap together,  (_All skip around._)         Clap, clap away;      The steerage is a happy place--        Tomorrow's Christmas Day.  ANITA (_comes forward to C. surrounded by the others_). Oh, I've just had the grandest time. It was so superb, magnificent, sublime! (_Extends arms in ecstasy._) I have-a been at the leetla window watching the great, grand, magnificent ocean. It was all so blue and so green and so purple--and the sinking sun is all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],["title","The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#6)"],["body","on the great-a, beeg waves, like-a sparkling diamonds. (_Use elaborate gestures at all times._) And me, the poor, leetla Italian girl, gets to see all this great-a, grand-a ocean. It is superb, magnificent, sublime! Ah, I am so happy, I could sing and dance and kees everybody on the great-a, grand-a earth!  MEENY (_at L._). Vot makes you so happy, Anita? Maybe I'd be happy yet also, if I didn't get seasick once in a while.  ANITA. What makes me so happy, Meeny? It's the sun and the waves, and the sunlight shining like diamonds on the great-a, grand-a ocean. Are you not also happy, Biddy Mary?  BIDDY MARY (_standing by_ ANITA). I am not. Sure, I niver do be having time to be seeing diamonds on the great big waves. I have to be hard at work, so I do, peeling the praties for our Christmas breakfast.  ANITA. I watched the great-a red sun as he began to sink, sink, sink way down in the ocean. And the beeg-a waves got more beeg and more beeg and on top of them I saw long white lace fringe. The green silk waves were all-a trimmed with white lace fringe. And sometimes I think I see the leetla mermaid fairies dancing in the foam. Leetla green and white mermaids with the long long-a hair.  TOMASSO (_at R._). You make-a me seek, Anita. There is-a no such things as fairies.  ANITA. But I love to _think_ there is. It is a great, grand-a pleasure just to think there is. Is it not, Meeny?  MEENY (_stolidly_). Oh, sure.  ANITA. And that is why we should all be so verra, verra happy. We can think such-a lovely things. The poor leetla children at-a home, pouf! They cannot think such things, because they have never seen such a great, beeg-a ship, or such a great, beeg-a ocean--  SERGIUS. Or a whale.  PADDY MIKE. Or a sailor man.  HULDA. Or a nice little steerage bed built just like a shelf in the wall.  TOMASSO. Or the great beeg-a engine that makes the ship go.  MEENY. Or the tons and tons of coal vay down deep by the cellar.  SERGIUS (_mocking her_). Way down deep by the cellar! Whoever heard of a cellar on board of a ship? You mean--down in the hatch.  MEENY. Hatch? Vot is dot hatch? Dis ain't a chicken, it's a boat. (_All laugh._)  KLINKER (_takes_ SCHWILLIE _by the hand and goes to_ ANITA). Anita, we want to ask you a question.  ANITA. Well, and what is the question of the leetla Dutch twins?  SCHWILLIE. Tonight is the night before Christmas.  KLINKER. Und we want to know if the good Saint Nicholas is coming tonight.  ANITA. I don't know. You see it would be a great beeg-a, long-a trip way out here on the ocean.  KLINKER (_half crying_). But I want him to come. I've been a awful good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Sure, you is. Und me also, ain't I, Klinker?  ANITA. If you have both been verra, verra good I think that maybe the good Saint will come. (_Looks around._) Have you all been verra, verra good?  OTHERS. Yes, all of us.  HANS. We're always very, very good at Christmas time.  AH GOO. Me velly, _velly_ good.  ANITA (_points off R._). See, way up there on the upper deck, are the rich, grand-a ladies and gentlemen coming out from the great, beeg-a dining-room. If you go and stand under the hole maybe they'll throw you some oranges or candy. They're awful nice peoples on the upper deck.  MEENY. Let's all go right away quick. Maybe we'll get some oranges und candy.  KLINKER. Oh, how I do love oranges und candy, don't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?  SCHWILLIE. Sure, und me also, don't I, Klinker?  SERGIUS. Let us all go together. (_All come forward and sing to tune of the Opening Song._)       We're happy little immigrants,        We'll sing our happy song,      Our hearts are light, our faces bright--        The good ship speeds along.      Then clap, clap, clap together,        Clap, clap away;      The steerage is a happy place--        Tomorrow's Christmas Day.  (_All the children except_ ANITA _go out at R., repeating the chorus of their song._)  ANITA. Surely the good-a Saint Nicholas will come tonight, because there are so many, many verra good children on board this-a ship. (_Counting on fingers._) There's Hulda from Holland and her two leetla brothers, the Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They must have a great-a beeg-a Christmas present. And there's Sergius from Russia, and Meeny and Paddy Mike and Biddy Mary, and Neelda from Spain, and Yakob and Hans and Ah Goo and Mieze and leetla Sano San from afar away Japan. They must all have the great-a, grand-a presents. Maybe I could write old Santa Claus a leetla letter and tell how good the poor children way down in the steerage have been. And there's my cousin Tomasso from Italy. Oh, Santa Claus must bring him a new violin. Then he can make-a the beautiful music on the golden streets of New York. If there is anybody at all in the whole beeg world who should have a nice-a, beeg-a Christmas, it is the verra poor leetla children whose mammas and papas haven't got very much money. But sometimes the good Santa Claus forgets all about the verra poor leetla children--and that's the mostest saddest thing of all, for they are the verra ones he should remember. When I get to be a great-a, beeg, grand-a, reech lady in the golden streets of New York, ah! then I will buy presents and presents and presents, and I will-a give them to all the verra poor leetla children in the world. I wonder why it is that the verra good Santa Claus sometimes forgets the poor leetla children on-a Christmas Day. He never forgets the reech leetla children, only those who are verra, verra poor. And that is a sad misfortune. If I had-a nice-a Christmas present, with many candies and figs and oranges, I could never rest until I had given something nice to all the poor leetla children in the city--for that is what makes the mostest happy Christmas of all.  _Enter_ SERGIUS _from R. quietly. He comes down behind_ ANITA _and places his hands over her eyes._  SERGIUS. Guess who it is.  ANITA. Sergius!  SERGIUS (_disappointed_). Why, I thought that you would think it was a goblin.  ANITA. Goblin? What is a goblin, Sergius?  SERGIUS. It's a little, wee bit of a man with a long beard. And they go around having a good time at night. They are always very active on the night before Christmas. (_Looks cautiously around._) I shouldn't be at all surprised if we should see some tonight.  ANITA (_frightened_). Oh, Sergius, will they harm us?  SERGIUS. Not very much. They just like to have a little fun, that's all. We have lots of them in Russia. And I believe there are some down here in the steerage.  ANITA (_grasps his arm_). Oh, Sergius! Where are they?  SERGIUS. Well, last night I could not sleep, so I got up and came in here, and just as I was passing by that barrel (_points to barrel up L.C. where_ JACK FROST _is concealed_), I thought I heard a noise. It was like some one rapping on the barrel. Like this. (_Raps on another barrel._) I thought it was a goblin and I never stopped running until I was safe in my bunk with the bedclothes around my head.  ANITA. Pooh! I'm not afraid. No leetla goblin man can make-a me afraid.  SERGIUS. They do wonderful things on Christmas Eve. But come; let us go to the bottom of the stairs. The ladies and gentlemen are looking down and Tomasso is playing his violin. Soon they will throw apples and oranges down to us, and perhaps money. Come and see.  ANITA. No, I'd rather wait here.  SERGIUS (_crossing to door at R._). All right, but don't let the goblin man catch you. (_Exits at R._)  ANITA. The goblin man! Poof! There is no such thing as a goblin man. In-a Italy we do not have such goblin mans. He said he heard something rap, rap on the inside of the barrel. Poof! Sergius must have been having one beeg, grand-a dream. Never in all my life did I ever hear anything go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel. (_Stands close to_ JACK FROST'S _barrel._) And if I did, I'd think it was a leetla, weeny-teeny mouse. But a leetla, weeny-teeny mouse never could go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel, try as hard as he could. It must have been a dream.  JACK FROST (_raps sharply on the inside of the barrel_).  ANITA. Oh, what was that? I thought I heard something. (_Goes toward barrel cautiously._) Maybe it is the leetla, teeny-weeny baby mouse. (Rises on tiptoes to peer into the barrel.) I'll just peek in and see. (_Just as she looks into the barrel_, JACK FROST _pops up his head almost in her very face._)  JACK FROST. Hello!  ANITA (_starting back, very much frightened_). Oh!  JACK FROST. Did you say oh, or hello?  ANITA. I just said, oh.  JACK FROST. Well, then, hello. (_Climbs out of the barrel._)  ANITA. Hello.  JACK FROST (_goes to her_). You aren't frightened, are you?  ANITA (_at R._). Well, I'm a leetla frightened, but not verra much.  JACK FROST. Why? I won't hurt you.  ANITA. You came up so sudden. I never expected to find a boy in that barrel. And you are such a queer looking boy.  JACK FROST. Boy? I'm not a boy.  ANITA. You're not? You look like a boy. You're not a girl, are you?  JACK FROST (_indignantly_). Well, I should say not! I'm just a kind of a sort of a kind of an idea, that's all. I'm your imagination.  ANITA. I hope you're not a goblin.  JACK FROST. Oh, no. I'm not a goblin. They're old and have long beards. I'm not old at all. (_Twirls around on toes._) See, I'm even younger than you are. (_Makes low bow._) I'm a pixie.  ANITA. And what is a pixie?  JACK FROST. I told you before, it's just your imagination.  ANITA. You look like a boy. What is your name?  JACK FROST. My name is Claus.  ANITA. Claus! Why, what a funny leetla name. I never heard a name like that in Italy. Claus what?  JACK FROST. Santa Claus. Haven't you ever heard of Santa Claus?  ANITA. Oh, yes; many, many times. But you _can't_ be Santa Claus.  JACK FROST (_indignantly_). I'd like to know why I can't! It's my name, isn't it?  ANITA. But you are not the real, real truly Santa Claus. He is an old, old man. A leetla fat old man with white-a hair just like-a the snow, and "]]]
