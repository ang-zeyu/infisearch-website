He was not excessively fond of money, and had there been need would not have objected to a reduction of his allowance. But to be deprived of his rights in favor of a fellow like Thorne was intolerable. If Nicholas wished to annoy and anger him, he had succeeded.  \"Who told you this?\" demanded Jasper, sharply.  \"My mother,\" answered Nicholas, with a gratified smile.  \"When?\"  \"About fifteen minutes ago,\" replied Thorne, with provoking coolness.  \"I don't think she would do anything so outrageous.\"  \"Don't you? You'll find mother's got plenty of grit.\"  \"So have I,\" said Jasper, his face hardening. \"If your mother undertakes to wrong me she will repent it.\"  \"You had better not say that to her,\" said Thorne, insolently.  \"I shall when the proper time comes. My allowance is not due yet. I don't care for the money, but my father knew what it was proper for me to have.\"  \"There's going to be a row,\" thought Nicholas, with satisfaction. \"I'll bet on mother. She'll put down this whipper-snapper.\"  Jasper turned away, and walked out of the yard.  \"Where are you going?\" asked Thorne.  \"To walk.\"  \"I guess I'll go along, too.\"  \"I would rather go alone.\"  \"You're not very polite.\"  \"Excuse me,\" said Jasper, with the instinct of a gentleman. \"You would find me very poor company. Another time we will walk together.\"  \"Oh, just as you like; I don't want to intrude,\" said Thorne, sulkily.  They did not meet again till supper. Mrs. Kent presided. On one side sat Nicholas, on the other Jasper. Our hero looked sad. The kind, worn face he was accustomed to see at the head of the table was gone forever. He felt that he was indeed desolate. His appetite was very small, while, on the other hand, Nicholas seemed to be famished. His mother kept plying him with dainties and tidbits, and he appeared to like the treatment amazingly.  \"Why don't you eat, Jasper?\" asked Thorne with his mouth full.  \"I am not hungry.\"  \"I should think your walk might have given you an appetite.\"  \"It doesn't appear to.\"  \"You look awful glum. Is it what I said this afternoon?\"  \"About what?\"  \"Your allowance being cut down.\"  \"I wasn't thinking about that particularly. Besides, you are not the one from whom I expect to receive such communications.\"  \"It's all true, though, as you will find. Ain't it, mother?\" persisted Nicholas, who was anxious to have the row come off as soon as possible.  Jasper turned his glance upon Mrs. Kent.  \"You needn't have introduced the subject, Nicholas,\" she said, with slight reproof.  \"Why not, mother?\"  \"It isn't a proper subject to introduce at the supper-table.\"  \"You see, Jasper didn't half believe what I told him.\"  \"He may rely upon your statement,\" said Mrs. Kent.  \"Am I to understand that my allowance is reduced to three dollars a week?\" asked Jasper, who felt that he had been dragged into the discussion.  \"Yes. I consider that three dollars a week is a liberal allowance for a boy of your age.\"  \"My father gave me five.\"  \"Your father acted according to his judgment,\" said Mrs. Kent, coldly. \"On some points I differ from him in judgment. I think that he indulged you too much, probably because you were his only child.\"  \"He was always kind to me,\" said Jasper. \"It was his nature to be kind.\"  \"You will find me kind, too, if you deserve it,\" said his step-mother. But her tone belied her words.  \"Nicholas tells me that his allowance is to be five dollars,\" said Jasper.  \"I conceive that the amount of his allowance has nothing to do with yours,\" said Mrs. Kent.  \"Is it true?\" persisted Jasper.  \"It is,\" said Mrs. Kent, with a defiant look, which Jasper interpreted to mean \"What are you going to do about it?\"  \"Why is he to receive five dollars, if I am only to get three?\"  \"Because I choose.\"  \"You have answered rightly,\" said Jasper, scornfully. \"Even you are unable to defend it on the score of fairness or justice.\"  Mrs. Kent's thin lips compressed.  \"Audacious boy!\" she exclaimed, \"do you dare to speak to me in this style?\"  \"I am not aware of any impropriety, madam. I am protesting against your unjust partiality for Nicholas.\"  \"He is my son.\"  \"I am aware of that; but the money out of which the allowance is paid came to you from my father.\"  \"Do you dare to continue your impertinent remarks?\" exclaimed his step-mother, pale with rage.  \"Madam, I am only stating the truth,\" said Jasper, sturdily. \"You cannot expect me to submit tamely to such an injustice. Had you reduced my allowance and given Nicholas no more I would have let it pass.\"  \"I won't submit to this impertinence!\" exclaimed Mrs. Kent, furiously. \"Nicholas, will you sit there and see your mother insulted?\"  \"What do you want me to do, mother?\" asked Thorne, not exactly liking the turn matters had taken.  \"Put that unmannerly boy out of the room.\"  \"Oh, there ain't any need of that,\" said Thorne, who knew by experience Jasper's strength.  \"Do as I say, or I will give you no allowance at all!\" said Mrs. Kent, stamping her foot angrily.  Nicholas unwillingly arose from his seat and approached Jasper.  \"You'd better not try it, Thorne,\" said Jasper, coolly.  \"Do you hear that, sir? He has insulted you, too,\" said Mrs. Kent, in a furious passion.  It was these words, perhaps, that spurred Nicholas to his task. Jasper had now risen, and Thorne threw himself upon him.  But Jasper was prepared. In less time than I have required to tell it, Thorne found himself prostrate on the floor.  \"Madam,\" said Jasper, turning to his step-mother, \"I am ready to leave your presence now, but of my own accord.\"  He left the room. Mrs. Kent was too astonished to speak. She had felt no doubt that Nicholas was more than a match for Jasper, as he certainly was bigger, and weighed twenty pounds more.  \"My poor boy!\" she said, pitifully, bending over her son; \"are you much hurt?\"  \"Yes,\" said Nicholas; \"and it's all on account of you!\"  \"I thought you were stronger than he.\"  \"So I am, but he knows how to wrestle; besides, he's so quick.\"  \"I thought you could have put him out easily.\"  \"Well, don't set me to doing it again,\" said Thorne, sulkily. \"I didn't want to fight. You made me.\"  \"Don't mind it, my dear boy. It was because I was angry with him.\"  \"Oh, how my head aches!\"  \"I'll put on some cologne. I'll give you an extra five dollars, too, for standing by your mother.\"  \"All right, mother,\" said Thorne, in a more cheerful tone. \"That's the way to talk. Give it to me now.\"  Jasper did not see either of them again that evening. He called on a friend, and, entering the house at ten o'clock, went directly to his own room.     CHAPTER XII.  A SCHEME OF VENGEANCE.   Mrs. Kent had never cared for Jasper. Since the marriage she had disliked him. Now that he had struck down Nicholas in her presence, she positively hated him. She did not stop to consider that he was provoked to it, and only acted in self-defense. She thirsted for revenge--more, indeed, than Nicholas, who, bully as he was, having been fairly worsted, was disposed to accept his defeat philosophically. If he could annoy or thwart Jasper he would have been glad to do it, but he did not desire to injure him physically.  Not so Mrs. Kent.  Her darling had been assaulted and defeated in her presence. She did not again wish to put him against Jasper lest he should be again defeated, but she wished Jasper, her detested step-son, to drink the same cup of humiliation which had been forced upon Nicholas.  So she sat pondering how to accomplish the object she had in view. She could not herself beat Jasper, though, had he been younger and smaller, she would certainly have attempted it. She must do it by deputy.  Under the circumstances she thought of Tom Forbes, a strong and stalwart hired man, who had been for some months working on the place. Probably he would not like the task, but she would threaten to discharge him if he refused to obey her commands, and this, she thought, would bring him around.  \"I wonder where Jasper is?\" said Nicholas, about eight o'clock, as he sat opposite the little table where his mother was sewing.  \"Gone out, I suppose,\" said Mrs. Kent.  \"He found the house too hot to hold him,\" suggested Thorne.  \"He certainly will if he conducts himself in the future as he has already done. He makes a mistake if he thinks I will tolerate such conduct.\"  \"It's because you're a woman,\" said her son. \"Boys of his age don't make much account of women.\"  \"Do you speak for yourself as well as for him?\" asked Mrs. Kent, sharply.  \"Of course not,\" said Nicholas, whose interest it was to keep on good terms with his mother. \"Of course not; besides, you are my mother.\"  \"You are much more of a gentleman than Jasper is,\" said his mother, appeased.  \"I hope so,\" said Nicholas.  \"As for him, I consider him a young ruffian.\"  \"So he is,\" said Thorne, who was ready to assent to anything that his mother might say.  \"And yet his father thought him a paragon!\" continued Mrs. Kent, her lip curling. \"It is strange how parents can be deceived!\"  Unconsciously she illustrated the truth of this remark in her own person. She considered Nicholas handsome, spirited, and amiable--indeed, as an unusually fascinating and attractive boy. To others he was big, overgrown, malicious, and stupid. But then mothers are apt to look through different spectacles from the rest of the world.  \"I guess Jasper'll want to change his guardian,\" said Thorne, laughing. \"You and he won't hitch horses very well.\"  \"Don't use such a common expression, Nicholas. I want you to grow up a well-bred gentleman.\"  \"Oh, well, I mean to. But I say, if his father liked him so much, what made him appoint you to take care of him?\"  \"He didn't know how I felt toward Jasper. I humored his fancies, and treated him better than I felt toward him.\"  \"Then you wanted to be his guardian?\"  \"Yes, I wanted to pay off old scores,\" said Mrs. Kent, again compressing her lips with unpleasant firmness.  \"What made"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19594"],["title","The Eugenic Marriage, Volume 1 (of 4) (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note: A few typographical errors have been corrected: they are listed at the end of the text.
