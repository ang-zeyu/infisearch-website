When the early Nordics outgrew their first home beside the Baltic they began sailing off to seek their fortune overseas.  In course of time they not only spread over the greater part of northern Europe but went as far south as Italy and Spain, where the good effects of their bracing blood have never been lost.  They even left descendants among the Berbers of North Africa; and, as we have learnt already, some of them went as far east as the Black Sea.  The Belgians, Dutch, and Germans of Caesar's day were all Nordic.  So were the Franks, from whom France takes its name.  The Nordic blood, of course, became more or less mingled with that of the different peoples the Nordic tribes subdued; and new blood coming in from outside made further changes still.  But the Nordic strain prevailed, as that of the conquerors, even where the Nordic folk did not outnumber all the rest, as they certainly did in Great Britain.  The Franks, whose name meant \"free men\", at last settled down with the Gauls, who outnumbered them; so that the modern French are a blend of both.  But the Gauls were the best warriors of all the Celts: it took Caesar eight years to conquer them.  So we know that Frenchmen got their soldier blood from both sides.  We also know that they learnt a good deal of their civilization from the Romans and passed it on to the empire-building Normans, who brought more Nordic blood into France.  The Normans in their turn passed it on to the Anglo-Saxons, who, with the Jutes and Danes, form the bulk, as the Normans form the backbone, of most English-speaking folk within the British Empire.  The Normans are thus the great bond of union between the British Empire and the French.  They are the Franco-British kinsfolk of the sea.  We must not let the fact that Prussia borders on the North Sea and the Baltic mislead us into mistaking the Prussians for the purest offspring of the Nordic race.  They are nothing of the kind.  Some of the finest Nordics did stay near their Baltic home.  But these became Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes; while nearly all the rest of the cream of this mighty race went far afield.  Its Franks went into France by land.  Its Normans went by sea.  Others settled in Holland and Belgium and became the Dutch and Flemings of today.  But the mightiest host of hardy Norsemen crossed the North Sea to settle in the British Isles; and from this chosen home of merchant fleets and navies the Nordic British have themselves gone forth as conquering settlers across the Seven Seas.  The Prussians are the least Nordic of all the Germans, and most Germans are rather the milk than the cream of the Nordic race; for the cream generally sought the sea, while the milk stayed on shore.  The Prussians have no really Nordic forefathers except the Teutonic Knights, who killed off the Borussi or Old-Prussian savages, about seven hundred years ago, and then settled the empty land with their soldiers of fortune, camp-followers, hirelings, and serfs.  These gangs had been brought together, by force or the hope of booty, from anywhere at all.  The new Prussians were thus a pretty badly mixed lot; so the Teutonic Knights hammered them into shape as the newer Prussians whom Frederick the Great in the eighteenth century and Bismarck in the nineteenth turned into a conquering horde.  The Kaiser's newest Prussians need no description here.  We all know him and them; and what became of both; and how it served them right.  The first of the hardy Norsemen to arrive in England with a regular fleet and army were the two brothers, Hengist and Horsa, whom the Celts employed to defend them against the wild Picts that were swarming down from the north.  The Picts once beaten, the Celts soon got into the same troubles that beset every people who will not or can not fight for themselves.  More and more Norsemen kept coming to the Isle of Thanet, the easternmost point of Kent, and disputes kept on growing between them and the Celts over pay and food as well as over the division of the spoils.  The Norsemen claimed most of the spoil, because their sword had won it.  The Celts thought this unfair, because the country was their own.  It certainly was theirs at that time.  But they had driven out the people who had been there before them; so when they were themselves driven out they suffered no more than what they once had made these others suffer.  Presently the Norsemen turned their swords on the Celts and began a conquest that went on from father to son till there were hardly any Celts left in the British Isles outside of Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, and the greater part of Ireland.  Every place easily reached from the sea fell into the hands of the Norsemen whenever they chose to take it; for the Celts never even tried to have a navy.  This, of course, was the chief reason why they lost the war on land; because the Norsemen, though fewer by far at first, could move men, arms, and supplies ten times better than the Celts whenever the battlefields were anywhere near the sea.  Islands, harbours, and navigable rivers were often held by the Norsemen, even when the near-by country was filled with Celts.  The extreme north of Scotland, like the whole of the south, became Norse, as did the northern islands of Orkney and Shetland.  Scapa Flow, that magnificent harbour in the Orkneys, was a stronghold of Norsemen many centuries before their descendants manned the British Grand Fleet there during the recent war.  The Isle of Man was taken by Norsemen.  Dublin, Waterford, and other Irish cities were founded by them.  They attacked Wales from Anglessey; and, wherever they conquered, their armies were based on the sea.  If you want to understand how the British Isles changed from a Celtic to a Nordic land, how they became the centre of the British Empire, and why they were the Mother Country from which the United States were born, you must always view the question from the sea.  Take the sea as a whole, together with all that belongs to it--its islands, harbours, shores, and navigable rivers.  Then take the roving Norsemen as the greatest seamen of the great seafaring Nordic race.  Never mind the confusing lists of tribes and kings on either side--the Jutes and Anglo-Saxons, the Danes and Normans, on one side, and the Celts of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, on the other; nor yet the different dates and places; but simply take a single bird's-eye view of all the Seven Seas as one sea, of all the British Norsemen as one Anglo-Norman folk, and of all the centuries from the fifth to the twentieth as a single age; and then you can quite easily understand how the empire of the sea has been won and held by the same strong \"Hardy-Norseman\" hands these fifteen hundred years.  There is nothing to offend the Celts in this.  They simply tried to do what never can be done: that is, they tried to hold a sea-girt country with nothing but an army, while their enemy had an army and a fleet. They fought well enough in the past on many a stricken field to save any race's honour; and none who know the glorious deeds of the really Celtic Highland, Welsh, or Irish regiments can fail to admire them now. But this book is about seamen and the sea, and how they have changed the fate of landsmen and the land.  So we must tell the plain truth about the Anglo-Norman seamen without whom there could be no British Empire and no United States.  The English-speaking peoples owe a great deal to the Celts; and there is Celtic blood in a good many who are of mostly Nordic stock.  But the British Empire and the American Republic were founded and are led more by Anglo-Normans than even Anglo-Normans know.  For the Anglo-Normans include not only the English and their descendants overseas but many who are called Scotch and Irish, because, though of Anglo-Norman blood, they or their forefathers were born in Scotland or Ireland.  Soldiers and sailors like Wellington, Kitchener, and Beatty are as Anglo-Norman by descent as Marlborough, Nelson, and Drake, though all three were born in Ireland.  They are no more Irish Celts than the English-speaking people in the Province of Quebec are French-Canadians.  They might have been as good or better if born Irish Celts or French-Canadians.  But that is not the point.  The point is simply a fact without which we cannot understand our history; and it is this: that, for all we owe to other folk and other things than fleets, our sea-girt British Empire was chiefly won, and still is chiefly kept, by warriors of the sea-borne \"Hardy-Norseman\" breed.    THE SEA-FARER      Desire in my heart ever urges my spirit to wander,   To seek out the home of the stranger in lands afar off.     There is no one that dwells on earth so exalted in mind,   So large in his bounty, nor yet of such vigorous youth,     Nor so daring in deeds, nor to whom his liege lord is so kind,   But that he has always a longing, a sea-faring passion     For what the Lord God shall bestow, be it honour or death.   No heart for the harp has he, nor for acceptance of treasure,     No pleasure has he in a wife, no delight in the world,   Nor in aught save the roll of the billows; but always a longing,     A yearning uneasiness hastens him on to the sea.  _Anonymous_.  _Translated from the Anglo-Saxon_.     CHAPTER VI  THE IMPERIAL NORMAN  (1066-1451)  The Celts had been little more than a jumble of many different tribes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19849"],["title","Flag and Fleet: How the British Navy Won the Freedom of the Seas (#5)"],["body","the Romans came.  The Romans had ruled England and the south of Scotland as a single country.  But when they left it the Celts had let it fall to pieces again.  The Norsemen tried, time after time, to make one United Kingdom; but they never quite succeeded for more than a few years.  They had to wait for the empire-building Normans to teach them how to make, first, a kingdom and then an empire that would last.  Yet Offa, Edgar, and Canute went far towards making the first step by trying to raise a Royal Navy strong enough to command at least the English sea.  Offa, king of Mercia or Middle England (757-796) had no sooner fought his way outwards to a sure foothold on the coast than he began building a fleet so strong that even the great Emperor Charlemagne, though ruling the half of Europe, treated him on equal terms.  Here is Offa's good advice to all future kings of England: \"He who would be safe on land must be supreme at sea.\"  Alfred the Great (871-901) was more likely to have been thinking of the navy than of anything else when, as a young man hiding from the Danes, he forgot to turn the cakes which the housewife had left him to watch.  Anyhow he tried the true way to stop the Danes, by attacking them before they landed, and he caused ships of a new and better kind to be built for the fleet.  Edgar (959-975) used to go round Great Britain every year inspecting the three different fleets into which his navy was divided; one off the east of England, another off the north of Scotland, and the third in the Irish Sea.  It is said that he was once rowed at Chester on the River Dee by no less than eight kings, which showed that he was following Offa's advice by making his navy supreme over all the neighbouring coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.  After Edgar's death the Danes held command of the sea.  They formed the last fierce wave of hardy Norsemen to break in fury on the English shore and leave descendants who are seamen to the present day.  Nelson, greatest of all naval commanders, came from Norfolk, where Danish blood is strongest.  Most of the fishermen on the east coast of Great Britain are of partly Danish descent; and no one served more faithfully through the Great War than these men did against the submarines and mines. King George V, whose mother is a Dane, and who is himself a first-rate seaman, must have felt a thrill of ancestral pride in pinning V.C.'s over their undaunted hearts.  Fifty years before the Norman conquest Canute the Dane became sole king of England.  He had been chosen King of Denmark by the Danish Fleet.  But he was true to England as well; and in 1028, when he conquered Norway, he had fifty English vessels with him.  Meanwhile another great Norseman, Leif Ericsson, seems to have discovered America at the end of the tenth century: that is, he was as long before Columbus as Columbus was before our own day.  In any case Norsemen settled in Iceland and discovered Greenland; so it may even be that the \"White Eskimos\" found by the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913 were the descendants of Vikings lost a thousand years ago.  The Saga of Eric the Red tells how Leif Ericsson found three new countries in the Western World--Helluland, Markland, and Vinland.  As two of these must have been Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, which Cabot discovered with his English crew in 1497, it is certain that Canada was seen first either by Norsemen or by their descendants.  The Norse discovery of America cannot be certainly proved like the discoveries made by Cabot and Columbus.  But one proved fact telling in favour of the Norsemen is that they were the only people who built vessels \"fit to go foreign\" a thousand years ago.  All other people hugged the shore for centuries to come.  The Norsemen feared not any sea.  Some years ago a Viking (or Warrior's) ship, as old as those used by Ericsson, was found in the \"King's Mound\" in Gokstad, Southern Norway. Seated in her was the skeleton of the Viking Chief who, as the custom used to be, was buried in his floating home.  He must have stood well over six foot three and been immensely strong, judging by his deep chest, broad shoulders, and long arms fit to cleave a foeman at a single stroke.  This Viking vessel is so well shaped to stand the biggest waves, and yet slip through the water with the greatest ease, that she could be used as a model now.  She has thirty-two oars and a big square sail on a mast, which, like the one in the old Egyptian boat we were talking of in Chapter II, could be quickly raised or lowered. If she had only had proper sails and rigging she could have tacked against the wind.  But, as we shall soon see, the art of tacking was not invented till five centuries later; though then it was done by an English descendant of the Vikings.  Eighty foot long and sixteen in the beam, this Viking vessel must have looked the real thing as she scudded before a following wind or dashed ahead when her thirty-two oars were swept through the water by sixty-four pairs of the strongest arms on earth.  Her figure-head has gone; but she probably had a fierce dragon over the bows, just ready to strike.  Her sides were hung with glittering shields; and when mere landsmen saw a Viking fleet draw near, the oars go in, the swords come out, and Vikings leap ashore--no wonder they shivered in their shoes!  It was in this way that the Normans first arrived in Normandy and made a home there in spite of Franks and Gauls, just as the Danes made English homes in spite of Celts and Anglo-Saxons.  There was no navy to oppose them.  Neither was there any fleet to oppose William the Conqueror in 1066, when he crossed the Channel to seize the English Crown.  Harold of England had no great fleet in any case; and what he had was off the Yorkshire coast, where his brother had come to claim the Crown, backed by the King of Norway.  The Battle of Hastings, which made William king of England, was therefore a land battle only.  But the fact that William had a fleet in the Channel, while Harold had not, gave William the usual advantage in the campaign.  From that day to this England has never been invaded; and for the best of all reasons--because no enemy could ever safely pass her fleet.  [Illustration: WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR'S TRANSPORTS]  The Normans at last gave England what none of her other Norsemen gave her, the power of becoming the head and heart of the future British Empire.  The Celts, Danes, Jutes, and Anglo-Saxons had been fusing together the iron of their natures to make one strong, united British race.  The Normans changed this iron into steel: well tempered, stronger than iron could be, and splendidly fit for all the great work of imperial statesmen as well as for that of warriors by land and sea.  The Normans were not so great in numbers.  But they were very great in leadership.  They were a race of rulers.  Picked men of Nordic stock to start with, they had learnt the best that France could teach them: Roman law and order and the art of founding empires, Frankish love of freedom, a touch of Celtic wit, and the new French civilization.  They went all over seaboard Europe, conquerors and leaders wherever they went.  But nowhere did they set their mark so firmly and so lastingly as in the British Isles.  They not only conquered and became leaders among their fellow-Norsemen but they went through most of Celtic Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, founding many a family whose descendants have helped to make the Empire what it is.  William the Conqueror built a fleet as soon as he could; for only a few of the vessels he brought over from Normandy were of any use as men-of-war.  But there were no great battles on the water till the one off the South Foreland more than a century after his death.  He and the kings after him always had to keep their weather eye open for Danes and other rovers of the sea as well as for the navy of the kings of France. But, except when Henry II went to Ireland in 1171, there was no great expedition requiring a large fleet.  Strongbow and other ambitious nobles had then begun conquering parts of Ireland on their own account. So Henry recalled his Englishmen, lest they should go too far without him, and held a court at which they promised to give him, as their liege overlord, all the conquests they either had made or might make. Henry, who understood the value of sea-power, at once granted them whatever they could conquer, except the seaports, which he would keep for the Crown.  When Henry died Richard the Lion-Hearted and Philip Augustus of France agreed to join in a great Crusade.  Zeal for the Christian religion and love of adventure together drew vast numbers of Crusaders to the Holy Land.  But sea-power also had a great deal to do with the Crusades. The Saracens, already strong at sea in the East, were growing so much stronger that Western statesmen thought it high time to check them, lest their fleets should command the whole Mediterranean and perhaps the seas beyond.  In 1190 Richard joined his fleet at Messina, in Sicily, where roving Normans were of course to be found as leaders in peace and war. Vinesauf the historian, who was what we should now call a war correspondent, wrote a glowing account of the scene.  \"As soon as the people heard of his arrival they rushed in crowds to the shore to behold the glorious King of England, and saw the sea covered with innumerable galleys.  And the sound of trumpets from afar, with the sharper blasts of clarions, resounded in their ears.  And they saw the galleys rowing near the land, adorned and furnished with all kinds of arms, with countless pennons floating in the breeze, ensigns at the tops of lances, the beaks of the galleys beautified by painting, and glittering shields hanging from the prows.  The sea looked as if it was boiling from the vast number of oar blades in it.  The trumpets grew almost deafening.  And each arrival was greeted with bursts of cheering.  Then our splendid King "]]]
