The chief modifications of the elementary sounds are the following:  before _r_ each of the vowels _e, i, o, u,_ and _y_ has almost the same sound (marked like the Spanish ñ) as in _her, birth, honor, burr,_ and _myrtle; o_ before _r_ sometimes has the sound of _aw,_ as in _or, for,_ etc.;  in unaccented syllables, each of the long vowels has a slightly shortened sound, as in f_a_tality, n_e_gotiate, int_o_nation, ref_u_tation, indicated by a dot above the sign for the long sound; (in a few words, such as d_i_gress, the sound is not shortened, however);  long _a_ (â) is slightly modified in such words as _care, fare, bare,_ etc., while _e_ has the same sound in words like _there, their,_ and _where_; (New Englan{d}פּ people give _a_ the short sound in such words as _care,_ etc., and pronounce _there_ and _where_ with the short sound of _a,_ while _their_ is pronounced with the short sound of _e_: this is not the best usage, however);  in _pass, class, command, laugh,_ etc., we have a sound of _a_ between Italian _a_ and short _a_ (indicated by a single dot over the _a_), though most Americans pronounce it as short, and most English give the Italian sound:  the correct pronunciation is between these two.  The Sounds of the Consonants.  We have already seen that there are two classes of consonant sounds, those which have a voice sound, as _b,_ called _sonant,_ and those which are mere breath sounds, like _p,_ called _surds_ or aspirates.  The chief difference between _b_ and _p_ is that one has the voice sound and the other has not.  Most of the other consonants also stand in pairs.  We may say that the sonant consonant and its corresponding surd are the hard and soft forms of the same sound.  The following table contains also simple consonant sounds represented by two letters: _Sonant                    Surd_     b                        p     d                        t     v                        f     g (hard)                 k     j                        ch     z                        s     th (in _thine_)          th (in _thin_)     zh (or z as in _azure_)  sh     w     y     l     m     n     r                        h  If we go down this list from the top to the bottom, we see that _b_ is the most closed sound, while _h_ is the most slight and open, and the others are graded in between (though not precisely as arranged above).  These distinctions are important, because in making combinations of consonants in the same syllable or in successive syllables we cannot pass abruptly from a closed sound to an open sound, or the reverse, nor from a surd sound to a sonant, or the reverse.  _L, m, n,_ and _r_ are called liquids, and easily combine with other consonants; and so do the sibilants (_s, z,_ etc.). In the growth of the language, many changes have been made in letters to secure harmony of sound (as changing _b_ to _p_ in _sub-port——support,_ and _s,_ to _f_ in _differ_―from _dis_ and _fero_).  Some combinations are not possible of pronunciation, others are not natural or easy; and hence the alterations.  The student of the language must know how words are built; and then when he comes to a strange word he can reconstruct it for himself.  While the short, common words may be irregular, the long, strange words are almost always formed quite regularly.  Most of the sonants have but one sound, and none of them has more than three sounds.  The most important variations are as follows:  C and G have each a soft sound and a hard sound.  The soft sound of _c_ is the same as _s,_ and the hard sound the same as _k_.  The soft sound of _g_ is the same as _j,_ and the hard sound is the true sound of _g_ as heard in _gone, bug, struggle_.  Important Rule.  _C_ and _G_ are soft before _e, i,_ and _y,_ and hard before all the other vowels, before all the other consonants, and at the end of words.  The chief exceptions to this rule are a few common words in which _g_ is hard before _e_ or _i_.  They include―_give, get, gill, gimlet, girl, gibberish, gelding, gerrymander, gewgaw, geyser, giddy, gibbon, gift, gig, giggle, gild, gimp, gingham, gird, girt, girth, eager,_ and _begin_.  G is soft before a consonant in _judgment{,} lodgment, acknowledgment,_ etc.  Also in a few words from foreign languages _c_ is soft before other vowels, though in such cases it should always be written with a cedilla (ç).  N when marked ñ in words from the Spanish language is pronounced _n-y_ (cañon like _canyon_).  Ng has a peculiar nasal sound of its own, as heard in the syllable _ing_.  N alone also has the sound of _ng_ sometimes before _g_ and _k,_ as in _angle, ankle, single,_ etc. (pronounced _ang-gle, ang-kle, sing-gle_).  Ph has the sound of _f,_ as in prophet.  Th has two sounds, a hard sound as in _the, than, bathe, scythe,_ etc., and a soft sound as in _thin, kith, bath, Smith,_ etc.  Contrast _breathe_ and _breath, lath_ and _lathe_; and _bath_ and _baths, lath_ and _laths,_ etc.  S has two sounds, one its own sound, as in _sin, kiss, fist_ (the same as _c_ in _lace, rice,_ etc.), and the sound of _z,_ as in _rise_ (contrast with _rice_), _is, baths, men's,_ etc.  X has two common sounds, one that of _ks_ as in _box, six,_ etc., and the other the sound of _gs,_ as in _exact, exaggerate_ (by the way, the first _g_ in this word is silent).  At the beginning of a word _x_ has the sound of _z_ as in _Xerxes_.  Ch has three sounds, as heard first in _child,_ second in _machine,_ and third in _character_.  The first is peculiar to itself, the second is that of _sh,_ and the third that of _k_.  The sound of _sh_ is variously represented:  by _sh{,}_ as in _share, shift, shirt,_ etc.  by _ti,_ as in _condition, mention, sanction,_ etc.  by _si,_ as in _tension, suspension, extension,_ etc.  by _ci,_ as in _suspicion_.  (Also, _crucifixion_.)  The kindred sound of _zh_ is represented by _z_ as in _azure,_ and _s_ as in _pleasure,_ and by some combinations.  Y is always a consonant at the beginning of a word when followed by a vowel, as in _yet, year, yell,_ etc.; but if followed by a consonant it is a vowel, as in _Ypsilanti_.  At the end of a word it is {al}ways a vowel, as in all words ending in the syllable _ly_.  Exercises.  It is very important that the student should master the sounds of the language and the symbols for them, or the diacritical marks, for several reasons:  First, because it is impossible to find out the true pronunciation of a word from the dictionary unless one clearly understands the meaning of the principal marks;  Second, because one of the essentials in accurate pronunciation and good spelling is the habit of analyzing the sounds which compose words, and training the ear to detect slight variations;  Third, because a thorough knowledge of the sounds and their natural symbols is the first step toward a study of the principles governing word formation, or spelling and pronunciation.  For purposes of instruction through correspondence or by means of a textbook, the diacritical marks representing distinct sounds of the language afford a substitute for the voice in dictation and similar exercises, and hence such work requires a mastery of what might at first sight seem a purely mechanical and useless system.  One of the best exercises for the mastery of this system is to open the unabridged dictionary at any point and copy out lists of words, writing the words as they ordinarily appear in one column, and in an adjoining column the phonetic form of the word.  When the list is complete, cover one column and reproduce the other from an application of the principles that have been learned.  After a few days, reproduce the phonetic forms from the words as ordinarily written, and again the ordinary word from the phonetic form.  Avoid memorizing as much as possible, but work solely by the application of principles.  Never write down a phonetic form without fully understanding its meaning in every detail.  A key to the various marks will be found at the bottom of every page of the dictionary, and the student should refer to this frequently.  In the front part of the dictionary there will also be found an explanation of all possible sounds that any letter may have; and every sound that any letter may have may be indicated by a peculiar mark, so that since several letters "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],["title","The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#5)"],["body","represent the same sound there are a variety of symbols for the same sound.  For the purposes of this book it has seemed best to offer only one symbol for each sound, and that symbol the one most frequently used.  For that reason the following example will not correspond precisely with the forms given in the dictionary, but a study of the differences will afford a valuable exercise.  Illustration.*   *In this exercise, vowels before r marked in webster with the double curve used over the Spanish n, are left unmarked.  Double o with the short sound is also left unmarked.    The first place that I can well remember was a large,   Thĕ first plās  thăt I kan wĕl  rēmĕmber woz ā lärj,  pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it.

Note.  In Webster's dictionary letters which are unmarked have an obscure sound often not unlike uh, or are silent, and letters printed in italics are nearly elided, so very slight is the sound they have if it can be said to exist at all.  In the illustration above, all very obscure sounds have been replaced by the apostrophe, while no distinction has been made between short vowels in accented and unaccented syllables.  Studies from the Dictionary.  The following are taken from Webster's Dictionary:  Ab-dŏm′-i-noŭs: The _a_ in _ab_ is only a little shorter than _a_ in _at,_ and the _i_ is short being unaccented, while the _o_ is silent, the syllable having the sound nŭs as indicated by the mark over the _u_.  Lĕss′en, (lĕs′n), lĕs′son, (lĕs′sn), lĕss′er, lĕs′sor: Each of these words has two distinct syllables, though there is no recognizable vowel sound in the last syllables of the first two.  This eliding of the vowel is shown by printing the _e_ and the _o_ of the final syllables in italics.  In the last two words the vowels of the final syllables are not marked, but have nearly the sound they would have if marked in the usual way for _e_ and _o_ before _r_.  As the syllables are not accented the vowel sound is slightly obscured.  Or in _lessor_ has the sound of the word _or_ (nearly), not the sound of _or_ in _honor,_ which will be found re-spelled (ŏn′ur).  It will be noted that the double s is divided in two of the words and not in the other two.  In _lesser_ and _lessen_ all possible stress is placed on the first syllables, since the terminations have the least possible value in speaking; but in _lesson_ and _lessor_ we put a little more stress on the final syllables, due to the greater dignity of the letter _o,_ and this draws over a part of the s sound.  Hon′-ey▬cōmb (hŭn′y–kōm): The heavy hyphen indicates that this is a compound word and the hyphen must always be written.  The hyphens printed lightly in the dictionary merely serve to separate the syllables and show how a word may be divided at the end of a line. The student will also note that the _o_ in _-comb_ has its full long value instead of being slighted.  This slight added stress on the _o_ is the way we have in speaking of indicating that _-comb_ was once a word by itself, with an accent of its own.  Exercise. Select other words from the dictionary, and analyse as we have done above, giving some explanation for every peculiarity found in the printing and marks.  Continue this until there is no doubt or hesitation in regard to the meaning of any mark that may be found.   CHAPTER II.  WORD-BUILDING.  English speaking peoples have been inclined to exaggerate the irregularities of the English word-formation.  The fact is, only a small number of common words and roots are irregular in formation, while fully nine tenths of all the words in the language are formed according to regular principles, or are regularly derived from the small number of irregular words.  We use the irregular words so much more frequently that they do indeed constitute the greater part of our speech, but it is very necessary that we should master the regular principles of word-building, since they give us a key to the less frequently used, but far more numerous, class which fills the dictionary, teaching us both the spelling of words of which we know the sound, and the pronunciation of words which we meet for the first time in reading.  Accent.  In English, accent is an essential part of every word. It is something of an art to learn to throw it on to any syllable we choose, for unless we are able to do this we cannot get the true pronunciation of a word from the dictionary and we are helpless when we are called on to pronounce a word we have never heard.  Perhaps the best way to learn the art of throwing accent is by comparing words in which we are in the habit of shifting the accent to one syllable or another according to the meaning, as for instance the following:   1.  Accent.  a.  What _ac′cent_ has this word?  b.  With what _accent′uation_ do you _accent′_ this word?   2.  Concert.  a.  Did you go to the _con′cert_ last night?  b.  By _concert′ed_ action we can do anything.   3.  Contrast.  {a}Ъ.  What a _con′trast_ between the rich man and the poor man!  b.  _Contrast′_ good with bad, black with white, greatness with littleness.   4.  Permit.  a.  I have a building_-per′mit_.  b.  My mother will not _permit′_ me to go.   5.  Present.  a.  He received a beautiful Christmas _pres′ent_.  b.  She was _present′ed_ at court.   6.  Prefix.  a.  Sub is a common _pre′fix_.  b.  _Prefix′_ sub to port and you get support.   7.  Compound.  a.  He can _compound′_ medicine like a druggist.  b.  Nitroglycerine is a dangerous _com′pound_.  As a further illustration, read the following stanza of poetry, especially accenting the syllables as marked:       Tell′ me not′ in mourn′ful num′bers,        “Life′ is but′ an emp′ty dream′!”      For′ the soul′ is dead′ that slum′bers,        And′ things are′ not what′ they seem′.  This is called scanning, and all verse may be scanned in the same way. It is an excellent drill in learning the art of throwing the stress of the voice on any syllable that may be desired.  Two Laws of Word-Formation.  We are now prepared to consider the two great laws governing word-formation.  These are:  1.  Law: All vowels in combination with consonants are naturally short unless the long sound is given by combination with other vowels, by accent, or by position in the syllable with reference to consonants.  2.  Law: Words derived from other words by the addition of prefixes or suffixes always retain the original form as far as possible.  1.  We are likely to suppose that the natural or original sound of a vowel is the long sound, because that is the sound we give it when naming it in the alphabet.  If we will examine a number of words, however, we shall soon see that in combination with consonants all vowels have a tendency to a short or obscure pronunciation.  The sounds of the consonants are naturally obscure, and they draw the vowels to a similar obscurity.  Since such is the case, when a vowel is given its long sound there is always a special reason for it.  In the simple words _not, pin, her, rip, rid, cut, met,_ we have the short sounds of the vowels; but if we desire the long sounds we must add a silent _e,_ which is not pronounced as _e,_ but has its sound value in the greater stress put upon the vowel with which it is connected.  By adding silent _e_ to the above words we have _note, pine, here, ripe, ride, mete_.  In each of these cases the _e_ follows the consonant, though really combining with the vowel before the consonant; but if we place the additional _e_ just after the first _e_ in _met_ we have _meet,_ which is a word even more common than _mete.  E_ is the only vowel that may be placed after the consonant and still combine with the vowel before it {while being silent}; but nearly all the other vowels may be placed beside the vowel that would otherwise be short in order to make it long, and sometimes this added vowel is placed before as well as after the vowel to be lengthened.  Thus we have _boat, bait, beat, field, chief,_ etc.  There are a very, very few irregular words in which the vowel sound has been kept short in spite of the added vowel, as for instance, _head, sieve,_ etc.  It appears that with certain consonants the long sound is especially difficult, and so in the case of very common words the wear of common speech has shortened the vowels in spite of original efforts to strengthen them. This is peculiarly true of the consonant _v,_ and the combination _th,_ and less so of _s_ and _z_.  So in {(I) }_live, have, give, love, shove, move,_ etc., the vowel sound is more or less obscured even in spite of the silent _e,_ though in the less common words _alive, behave,_ etc., the long sound strengthened by accent has"]]]
