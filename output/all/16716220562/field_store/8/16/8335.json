John, we judge, seems to have had plenty of shrewdness, and was not without a sense of his own limitations. A chance came to him of commercial success in a distant land, and he seized that chance. A Norwich friend, Allday Kerrison, had gone out to Mexico, and writing from Zacatecas in 1825 asked John to join him. John accepted. His salary in the service of the Real del Monte Company was to be Â£300 per annum. He sailed for Mexico in 1826, having obtained from his Colonel, Lord Orford, leave of absence for a year, it being understood that renewals of that leave of absence might be granted. He was entitled to half-pay as a Lieutenant of the West Norfolk Militia, and this he settled upon his mother during his absence. His career in Mexico was a failure. There are many of his letters to his mother and brother extant which tell of the difficulties of his situation. He was in three Mexican companies in succession, and was about to be sent to Columbia to take charge of a mine when he was stricken with a fever, and died at Guanajuato on 22nd November 1838. He had far exceeded any leave that his Colonel could in fairness grant, and before his death his name had been taken off the army rolls. The question of his pay produced a long correspondence, which can be found in the archives of the Rolls Office. I have the original drafts of these letters in Borrow's handwriting. The first letter by Borrow is dated 8th September 1831; it is better to give the correspondence in its order.[20] The letters speak for themselves, and require no comment.   I  To the Rt. Hon. The Secretary at War                  WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _September 8, 1831._       SIR,--I take the liberty of troubling you with these lines for      the purpose of enquiring whether there is any objection to the      issuing of the disembodied allowance of my brother Lieut. John      Borrow of the Welsh Norfolk Militia, who is at present abroad.      I do this by the advice of the Army Pay Office, a power of      Attorney having been granted to me by Lieut. Borrow to receive      the said allowance for him. I beg leave to add that my brother      was present at the last training of his regiment, that he went      abroad with the leave of his Commanding Officer, which leave of      absence has never been recalled, that he has sent home the      necessary affidavits, and that there is no clause in the Pay      and Clothing Act to authorize the stoppage of his allowance. I      have the honor to remain, Sir, your most obedient, humble      servant,                  GEORGE BORROW.   II  To the Right Hon. The Secretary at War                  WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _17th Septr. 1831._       SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of No. 33,063, dated      16th inst., from the War Office, in which I am informed that      the Office does not feel authorized to give instructions for      the issue of the arrears of disembodied allowance claimed by my      brother Lieut. Borrow of the West Norfolk, until he attend the      next training of his regiment, and I now beg leave to ask the      following question, and to request that I may receive an      answer with all convenient speed. What farther right to his      _present_ arrears of disembodied allowance will Lieut. Borrow's      appearance at the _next training_ of his regiment confer upon      him, and provided there is no authority at present for ordering      the payment of those arrears, by what authority will the War      Office issue instructions for the payment of the same, after      his arrival in this country and attendance at the training?      Sir, provided Lieut. Borrow is not entitled to his arrears of      disembodied allowance at the present moment, he will be      entitled to them at no future period, and I was to the last      degree surprised at the receipt of an answer which tends to      involve the office in an inextricable dilemma, for it is in      fact a full acknowledgment of the justice of Lieutenant      Borrow's claims, and a refusal to satisfy them until a certain      time, which instantly brings on the question, 'By what      authority does the War Office seek to detain the disembodied      allowance of an officer, to which he is entitled by Act of      Parliament, a moment after it has become due and is legally      demanded?' If it be objected that it is not legally demanded, I      reply that the affidavits filled up in the required form are in      the possession of the Pay Office, and also a power of Attorney      in the Spanish language, together with a Notarial translation,      which power of Attorney has been declared by the Solicitor of      the Treasury to be legal and sufficient. To that part of the      Official letter relating to my brother's appearance at the next      training I have to reply, that I believe he is at present lying      sick in the Mountains above Vera Cruz, the pest-house of the      New World, and that the last time I heard from him I was      informed that it would be certain death for him to descend into      the level country, even were he capable of the exertion, for      the fever was then raging there. Full six months have elapsed      since he prepared to return to his native country, having      received information that there was a probability that his      regiment would be embodied, (but) the hand of God overtook him      on his route. He is the son, Sir, of an Officer who served his      King abroad and at home for upwards of half a century; he had      intended his disembodied allowance for the use of his widowed      and infirm mother, but it must now be transmitted to him for      his own support until he can arrive in England. But, Sir, I do      not wish to excite compassion in his behalf, all I request is      that he may have justice done him, and if it be, I shall be      informed in the next letter, that the necessary order has been      given to the Pay Office for the issue of his arrears. I have      the honor to remain, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,                  GEORGE BORROW.   III  To the Right Hon. The Secretary at War                  NORWICH, _Novr. 24, 1831._       SIR,--Not having been favoured with an answer to the letter      which I last addressed to you concerning the arrears of      disembodied allowance due to Lieut. John Borrow of the West      Norfolk Militia, I again take the liberty of submitting this      matter to your consideration. More than six months have elapsed      since by virtue of a power of attorney granted to me by Lieut.      Borrow, I made demand at the army Pay Office for a portion of      those arrears, being the amount of two affidavits which were      produced, but owing to the much unnecessary demur which ensued,      chiefly with respect to the power of Attorney, since declared      to be valid, that demand has not hitherto been satisfied. I      therefore am compelled to beg that an order may be issued to      the Pay Office for the payment to me of the sums specified in      the said affidavits, that the amount may be remitted to Lieut.      Borrow, he being at present in great need thereof. If it be      answered that Lieut. Borrow was absent at the last training of      his regiment, and that he is not entitled to any arrears of      pay, I must beg leave to observe that the demand was legally      made many months previous to the said training, and cannot now      be set aside by his non-appearance, which arose from      unavoidable necessity; he having for the last year been lying      sick in one of the provinces of New Spain. And now, Sir, I will      make bold to inquire whether Lieut. Borrow, the son of an      Officer, who served his country abroad and at home, for upwards      of fifty years, is to lose his commission for being incapable,      from a natural visitation, of attending at the training; if it      be replied in the affirmative, I have only to add that his case      will be a cruelly hard one. But I hope and trust, Sir, that      taking all these circumstances into consideration you will not      _yet_ cause his name to be stricken off the list, and that you      will permit him to retain his commission in the event of his      arriving in England with all the speed which his health of body      will permit, and that to enable him so to do his arrears[21]      you will forthwith give an order for the payment of his      arrears. I have the honor to be, Sir, your very humble servant,                  GEORGE BORROW.   IV  To the Rt. Hon. The Secretary at War                  NORWICH, _Decr. 13, 1831._       SIR,--I have just received a letter from my brother Lieutenant      J. Borrow, from which it appears he has had leave of absence      from his Colonel, the Earl of Orford, up to the present year.      He says 'in a letter dated Wolterton, 21st June 1828, Lord      Orford writes: \"should you want a further leave I will not      object to it.\" 20th May 1829 says: \"I am much obliged to you      for a letter of the 18th March, and shall be glad to allow you      leave of absence for a twelvemonth.\" I enclose his last letter      from Brussels, August 6, 1829. At the end it gives very evident      proof that my remaining in Mexico _was not only by his      Lordship's permission, but even by his advice_. Sir, if you      should require it I will transmit this last letter of the Earl      of Orford's, which my brother has sent to me, but beg leave to      observe that no blame can be attached to his Lordship in this      case, he having from a multiplicity of important business      doubtless forgotten these minor matters. I hope now, Sir, that      you will have no further objection to issue an order for the      payment of that portion of my brother's arrears specified in      the two affidavits in the possession of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19767"],["title","George Borrow and His Circle (#8)"],["body","General.      By the unnecessary obstacles which have been flung in my      brother's way in obtaining his arrears he has been subjected to      great inconvenience and distress. An early answer on this point      will much oblige, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,                  GEORGE BORROW.   V  To the Rt. Hon. The Secretary at War                  WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _May 24, 1833._       SIR,--I take the liberty of addressing you for the purpose of      requesting that an order be given to the Paymaster General for      the issue of the arrears of pay of my brother Lieutenant John      Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia, whose agent I am by virtue      of certain powers of Attorney, and also for the continuance of      the payment of his disembodied allowance. Lieutenant Borrow was      not present at the last training of his Regiment, being in      Mexico at the time, and knowing nothing of the matter. I beg      leave to observe that no official nor other letter was      dispatched to him by the adjutant to give him notice of the      event, nor was I, his agent, informed of it, he therefore      cannot have forfeited his arrears and disembodied allowance. He      was moreover for twelve months previous to the training, and      still is, so much indisposed from the effects of an attack of      the yellow fever, that his return would be attended with great      danger, which can be proved by the certificate of a Medical      Gentleman practising in Norwich, who was consulted from Mexico.      Lieutenants Harper and Williams, of the same Regiment, have      recovered their pay and arrears, although absent at the last      training, therefore it is clear and manifest that no objection      can be made to Lieut. Borrow's claim, who went abroad with his      Commanding Officer's permission, which those Gentlemen did not.      In conclusion I have to add that I have stated nothing which I      cannot substantiate, and that I court the most minute scrutiny      into the matter. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most      obedient and most humble servant,                  GEORGE BORROW.  [Illustration: GEORGE BORROW  From a portrait by his brother John Thomas Borrow taken in early youth when his hair was black. This portrait is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London.]  The last of these letters is in another handwriting than that of Borrow, who by this time had started for St. Petersburg for the Bible Society. The officials were adamant. To one letter the War Office replied that they could not consider any claims until Lieutenant Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia should have arrived in England to attend the training of his regiment. These five letters are, as we have said, in the Rolls Office, although the indefatigable Professor Knapp seems to have dropped across only two of them there. Their chief interest is in that they are the earliest in order of date of the hitherto known letters of Borrow. There is one further letter on the subject written somewhat later by old Mrs. Borrow. She also appeals to the War Office for her son's allowance.[22] It would seem clear that the arrears were never paid.   To the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Orford                  WILLOW LANE, NORWICH, _26 May 1834._       MY LORD,--I a few days since received the distressing      intelligence of the death of my dear son John, a lieutenant in      your Lordship's West Norfolk Regiment of Militia, after the      sufferings of a protracted and painful illness; the melancholy      event took place on the 22nd November last at Guanajuato in      Mexico. Having on the former irreparable loss of my dear      husband experienced your Lordship's kindness, I am induced to      trespass on your goodness in a like case of heavy affliction,      by requesting that you will be pleased to make the necessary      application to the Secretary at War to authorise me to receive      the arrears of pay due to my late son, viz.: ten months to the      period of the training, and from that time to the day of his      decease, for which I am informed it is requisite to have your      Lordship's certificate of leave of absence from the said      training. The amount is a matter of great importance to me in      my very limited circumstances, having been at considerable      expense in fitting him out, which, though at the time it      occasioned me much pecuniary inconvenience, I thought it my      duty to exert all my means to accomplish, my present distress      of mind is the greater having to struggle with my feelings      without the consolation and advice of my son George, who is at      this time at St. Petersburg. Your Lordship will, I trust,      pardon the liberty I am taking, and the trouble I am giving,      and allow for the feelings of an afflicted mother. I have the      honor to be your Lordship's most obedient servant,                  ANN BORROW.  I have said that there are letters of John Borrow's extant. Fragments of these will be found in Dr. Knapp's book. These show a keen intelligence, great practicality, and common sense. George--in 1829--had asked his brother as to joining him in Mexico. 'If the country is soon settled I shall say \"yes,\"' John answers. With equal wisdom he says to his brother, 'Do not enter the army; it is a bad spec.' In this same year, 1829, John writes to ask whether his mother and brother are 'still living in that windy house of old King's; it gives me the rheumatism to think of it.' In 1830 he writes to his mother that he wishes his brother were making money. 'Neither he nor I have any luck, he works hard and remains poor.' In February of 1831 John writes to George suggesting that he should endeavour to procure a commission in the regiment, and in July of the same year to try the law again:       I am convinced that your want of success in life is more owing      to your being unlike other people than to any other cause.  John, as we have seen, died in Mexico of fever. George was at St. Petersburg working for the Bible Society when his mother writes from Norwich to tell him the news. John had died on 22nd November 1833. 'You are now my only hope,' she writes, '... do not grieve, my dear George. I trust we shall all meet in heaven. Put a crape on your hat for some time.' Had George Borrow's brother lived it might have meant very much in his life. There might have been nephews and nieces to soften the asperity of his later years. Who can say? Meanwhile, _Lavengro_ contains no happier pages than those concerned with this dearly loved brother.  [Illustration: GEORGE BORROW'S BIRTHPLACE AT DUMPLING GREEN  _From a drawing by Fortunino Matania_]   FOOTNOTES:  [15] I am not able to trace more than three of John Borrow's pictures: firstly, a portrait of George Borrow, reproduced in this book, which was long in the possession of Mr. William Jarrold, the well-known publisher of Norwich, and is now in the National Portrait Gallery in London, having been purchased by the Director in 1912; secondly, the portrait of Borrow's father in the possession of a lady at Leamington; and thirdly, _The Judgment of Solomon_, which for a long time hung as an overmantel in the Borrow Home in Willow Lane, Norwich. Dr. Knapp also saw in Norwich 'A Portrait of a Gentleman,' by John Borrow. A second portrait of George Borrow by his brother was taken by the latter to Mexico, and has not since been heard of.

[18] Or perhaps the experience contained in a letter to Miss Mitford in 1824 (_Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table Talk_, 2 vols., 1876):  'I have had a horrid week with a mother and eight daughters! Mamma _remembering_ herself a beauty; Sally and Betsey, etc., see her a matron. They say, \"Oh! this is more suitable to mamma's age,\" and \"that fits mamma's time of life!\" But mamma does not agree. Betsey, and Sally, and Eliza, and Patty want \"mamma\"! Mamma wants herself as she looked when she was Betsey's age, and papa fell in love with her. So I am distracted to death. I have a great mind to paint her with a long beard like Salvator, and say, \"That's _my_ idea of a fit accompaniment.\"'  [19] _Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table Talk_, with a Memoir by his son Frederic Wordsworth Haydon, vol. i. pp. 360-61.

CHAPTER IV  A WANDERING CHILDHOOD   We do not need to inquire too deeply as to Borrow's possible gypsy origin in order to account for his vagabond propensities. The lives of his parents before his birth, and the story of his own boyhood, sufficiently account for the dominant tendency in Borrow. His father and mother were married in 1793. Almost every year they changed their domicile. In 1801 a son was born to them--they still continued to change their domicile. Captain Borrow followed his regiment from place to place, and his family accompanied him on these journeys. Dover, Colchester, Sandgate, Canterbury, Chelmsford--these are some of the towns where the Borrows sojourned. It was the merest accident--the Peace of Amiens, to be explicit--that led them back to East Dereham in 1803, so that the second son was born in his grandfather's house. George was only a month old when he was carried off to Colchester; in 1804 he was in the barracks of Kent, in 1805 of Sussex, in 1806 at Hastings, in 1807 at Canterbury, and so on. The indefatigable Dr. Knapp has recorded every detail for all who love the minute, the meticulous, in biography. The whole of the first thirteen years of Borrow's life is filled up in this way, until in 1816 he and his parents found a home of some permanence in Norwich. In 1809-10 they were at East Dereham, in 1810-11 at Norman Cross, in 1812"]]]
