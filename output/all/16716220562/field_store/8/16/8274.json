Four of our men stopped behind to bury the dog, the rest of us found our way into the communication trench. A signboard at the entrance, with the words \"To Berlin,\" stated in trenchant words underneath, \"This way to the war.\"  The communication trench, sloping down from the roadway, was a narrow cutting dug into the cold, glutinous earth, and at every fifty paces in alternate sides a manhole, capable of holding a soldier with full equipment, was hollowed out in the clay. In front shells were exploding, and now and again shrapnel bullets and casing splinters sung over our heads, for the most part delving into the field on either side, but sometimes they struck the parapets and dislodged a pile of earth and dust, which fell on the floor of the trench. The floor was paved with bricks, swept clean, and almost free from dirt; there was a general air of cleanliness about the place, the level floor, the smooth sides, and the well-formed parapets. An Engineer walking along the top, and well back from the side, counted us as we walked along in line with him. He had taken charge of our section as a working party, and when he turned to me in making up his tally I saw that he wore a ribbon (p. 064) on his breast.  \"He has got the Distinguished Conduct Medal,\" Mervin whispered. \"How did you get it?\" he called up to the man.  \"Just the luck of war,\" was the modest answer. \"Eleven, twelve, thirteen, that will be quite sufficient for me. Are you just new out?\" he asked.  \"Oh, we've been a few weeks in training here.\"  We met another Engineer coming out, his face was dripping with blood, and he had a khaki handkerchief tied round his hand.  \"How did it happen?\" I asked.  \"Oh, a damned pip-squeak (a light shrapnel shell) caught me on the parapet,\" he laughed, squeezing into a manhole. \"Two of your boys have copped it bad along there. No, I don't think it was your fellows. Who are you?\"  \"The London Irish.\"  \"Oh! 'twasn't you, 'twas the ----,\" he said, rubbing a miry hand across the jaw, dripping with blood, \"I think the two poor devils are done in. Oh, this isn't much,\" he continued, taking out a spare handkerchief and wiping his face, \"'twon't bring me back to England, worse      (p. 065) luck! Are you from Chelsea?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What about the chances for the Cup Final?\" he asked, and somebody took up the thread of conversation as I edged on to the spot where the two men lay.  They were side by side, face upwards, in a disused trench that branched off from ours; the hand of one lay across the arm of the other, and the legs of both were curled up to their knees, almost touching their chests. They were mere boys, clean of lip and chin and smooth of forehead, no wrinkles had ever traced a furrow there. One's hat was off, it lay on the floor under his head. A slight red spot showed on his throat, there was no trace of a wound. His mate's clothes were cut away across the belly, the shrapnel had entered there under the navel, and a little blood was oozing out on to the trouser's waist, and giving a darkish tint to the brown of the khaki. Two stretcher-bearers were standing by, feeling, if one could judge by the dejected look on their faces, impotent in the face of such a calamity. Two first field dressings, one open and the contents trod on the ground, the other fresh as when it left the hands of the makers,   (p. 066) lay idle beside the dead man. A little distance to the rear a youngster was looking vacantly across the parapet, his eyes fixed on the ruined church in front, but his mind seemed to be deep in something else, a problem which he failed to solve.  One of the stretcher-bearers pointed at the youth, then at the hatless body in the trench.  \"Brothers,\" he said.  For a moment a selfish feeling of satisfaction welled up in our lungs. Teak gave it expression, his teeth chattering even as he spoke, \"It might be two of us, but it isn't,\" and somehow with the thought came a sensation of fear. It might be our turn next, as we might go under to-day or to-morrow; who could tell when the turn of the next would come? And all that day I was haunted by the figure of the youth who was staring so vacantly over the rim of the trench, heedless of the bursting shells and indifferent to his own safety.  The enemy shelled persistently. Their objective was the ruined church, but most of their shells flew wide or went over their mark, and made matters lively in Harley Street, which ran behind the house of God.  \"Why do they keep shellin' the church?\" Bill asked the engineer,   (p. 067) who never left the parapet even when the shells were bursting barely a hundred yards away. Like the rest of us, Bill took the precaution to duck when he heard the sound of the explosion.  \"That's what they always do,\" said Stoner, \"I never believed it even when I read it in the papers at home, but now--\"  \"They think that we've ammunition stored there,\" said the engineer, \"and they always keep potting at the place.\"  \"But have we?\"  \"I dunno.\"  \"We wouldn't do it,\" said Kore, who was of a rather religious turn of mind. \"But they, the bounders, would do anything. Are they the brutes the papers make them out to be? Do they use dum-dum bullets?\"  \"This is war, and men do things that they'd not do in the ordinary way,\" was the noncommittal answer of the Engineer.  \"Have you seen many killed?\" asked Mervin.  \"Killed!\" said the man on the parapet. \"I think I have! You don't go through this and not see sights. I never even saw a dead man before this war. Now!\" he paused. \"That what we saw just now,\" he         (p. 068) continued, alluding to the death of the two soldiers in the trench, \"never moves me. _You'll_ feel it a bit being just new out, but when you're a while in the trenches you'll get used to it.\"  In front a concussion shell blew in a part of the trench, filling it up to the parapet. That afternoon we cleared up the mess and put down a flooring of bricks in a newly opened corner. When night came we went back to the village in the rear. \"The Town of the Last Woman\" our men called it. Slept in cellars and cooked our food, our bully stew, our potatoes, and tea in the open. Shells came our way continually, but for four days we followed up our work and none of our battalion \"stopped a packet.\"     CHAPTER VI                                                         (p. 069)  IN THE TRENCHES    Up for days in the trenches,     Working and working away;   Eight days up in the trenches     And back again to-day.   Working with pick and shovel,     On traverse, banquette, and slope,   And now we are back and working     With tooth-brush, razor, and soap.   We had been at work since five o'clock in the morning, digging away at the new communication trench. It was nearly noon now, and rations had not come; the cook's waggons were delayed on the road.  Stoner, brisk as a bell all the morning, suddenly flung down his shovel.  \"I'm as hungry as ninety-seven pigs,\" he said, and pulled a biscuit from his haversack.  \"Now I've got 'dog,' who has 'maggot'?\"  \"Dog and maggot\" means biscuit and cheese, but none of us had the latter; cheese was generally flung into the incinerator, where it wasted away in smoke and smell. This happened of course when we were new to the grind of war.  \"I've found out something,\" said Mervin, rubbing the sweat from    (p. 070) his forehead and looking over the parapet towards the firing line. A shell whizzed by, and he ducked quickly. We all laughed, the trenches have got a humour peculiarly their own.  \"There's a house in front,\" said Mervin, \"where they sell _caf√© noir_ and _pain et beurre_.\"  \"Git,\" muttered Bill. \"Blimey, there's no one 'ere but fools like ourselves.\"  \"I've just been in the house,\" said Mervin, who had really been absent for quite half an hour previously. \"There are two women there, a mother and daughter. A good-looking girl, Bill.\" The eyes of the Cockney brightened.  \"Twopence a cup for black coffee, and the same for bread and butter.\"  \"No civilians are allowed here,\" Pryor remarked.  \"It's their own home,\" said Mervin. \"They've never left the place, and the roof is broken and half the walls blown away.\"  \"I'm for coffee,\" Stoner cried, jumping over the parapet and stopping a shower of muck which a bursting shell flung in his face. We were with him immediately, and presently found ourselves at the door    (p. 071) of a red brick cottage with all the windows smashed, roof riddled with shot, and walls broken, just as Mervin had described.  A number of our men were already inside feeding. An elderly, well-dressed woman, with close-set eyes, rather thick lips, and a short nose, was grinding coffee near a flaming stove, on which an urn of boiling water was bubbling merrily. A young girl, not at all good-looking but very sweet in manner, said \"Bonjour, messieurs,\" as we entered, and approached each of us in turn to enquire into our needs. Mervin knew the language, and we placed the business in his hands, and sat down on the floor paved with red bricks; the few chairs in the house were already occupied.  The house was more or less in a state of disorder; the few pictures on the wall, the portrait of the woman herself, _The Holy Family Journeying to Egypt_, a print of Millet's _Angelus_, and a rude etching of a dog hung anyhow, the frames smashed and the glass broken. A Dutch clock, with figures of nymphs on the face, and the timing piece of a shell dangling from the weights, looked idly down, its pendulum gone and the glass broken.  Bill, naughty rascal that he is, wanted a kiss with his coffee,    (p. 072) and finding that Mervin refused to explain this to the girl, he undertook the matter himself.  \"Madham mosselle,\" he said, lingering over every syllable, \"I get no milk with cawfee, compree?\" The girl shook her head, but seemed to be amused.  \"Not compree,\" he continued, \"and me learnin' the lingo. I don't like French, you spell it one way and speak it the other. Nark (confound) it, I say, Mad-ham-m"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19710"],["title","The Red Horizon (#7)"],["body","oss-elle, voo (what's \"give,\" Mervin?) dunno, that's it. Voo dunno me a kiss with the cawfee, compree, it's better'n milk.\"  \"Don't be a pig, Bill,\" Stoner cut in. \"It's not fair to carry on like that.\"  \"Nark you, Stoner!\" Bill answered. \"It mayn't be fair, but it'd be nice if I got one.\"  \"Kiss a face like yours,\" muttered Mervin, \"she'd have a taste for queer things if she did.\"  \"There's no accountin' for tastes, you know,\" said Bill. \"Oh, Blimey, that's done it,\" he cried, stooping low as a shell exploded overhead, and drove a number of bullets into the roof. The old woman raised her head for a moment and crossed herself, then she continued her      (p. 073) work; the daughter looked at Bill, laughed, and punched him on the shoulder. In the action there was a certain contempt, and Bill forthwith relapsed into silence and troubled the girl no further. When we got out to our work again he spoke.  \"She was a fine hefty wench,\" he said, \"I'm tip over toes in love with her.\"  \"She's not one that I'd fancy,\" said Stoner.  \"Her finger nails are so blunt,\" mumbled Pryor, \"I never could stand a woman with blunt finger nails.\"  \"What is your ideal of a perfect woman, Pryor?\" I asked.  \"There is no perfect woman,\" was his answer, \"none that comes up to my ideal of beauty. Has she a fair brow? It's merely a space for wrinkles. Are her eyes bright? What years of horror when you watch them grow watery and weak with age. Are her teeth pearly white? The toothache grips them and wears them down to black and yellow stumps. Is her body graceful, her waist slender, her figure upright. She becomes a mother, and every line of her person is distorted, she becomes a nightmare to you. Ah, perfect woman! They could not      (p. 074) fashion you in Eden! When I think of a woman washing herself! Ugh! Your divinity washes the dust from her hair and particles of boiled beef from between her teeth! Think of it, Horatio!\"  \"Nark it, you fool,\" said Bill, lifting a fag end from the bottom of the trench and lighting it at mine. \"Blimey, you're balmy as nineteen maggots!\"  It was a few days after this incident that, in the course of a talk with Stoner, the subject of trenches cropped up.  \"There are trenches and trenches,\" he remarked, as we were cutting poppies from the parapet and flinging the flowers to the superior slope. \"There are some as I almost like, some as I don't like, and some so bad that I almost ran away from them.\"  For myself I dislike the narrow trench, the one in which the left side keeps fraying the cloth of your sleeve, and the right side strives to open furrows in your hand. You get a surfeit of damp, earthy smell in your nostrils, a choking sensation in your throat, for the place is suffocating. The narrow trench is the safest, and most of the English communication trenches are narrow--so narrow, indeed, that a man with a pack often gets held, and sticks there until his comrades pull   (p. 075) him clear.  The communication trenches serve, however, for more purposes than for the passage of troops; during an attack the reserves wait there, packed tight as sardines in a tin. When a man lies down he lies on his mate, when he stands up, if he dare to do such a thing, he runs the risk of being blown to eternity by a shell. Rifles, packs, haversacks, bayonets, and men are all messed up in an intricate jumble, the reserves lie down like rats in a trap, with their noses to the damp earth, which always reminds me of the grave. For them there is not the mad exhilaration of the bayonet charge, and the relief of striking back at the aggressor. They lie in wait, helpless, unable to move backward or forward, ears greedy for the latest rumours from the active front, and hearts prone to feelings of depression and despair.  The man who is seized with cramp groans feebly, but no one can help him. To rise is to court death, as well as to displace a dozen grumbling mates who have inevitably become part of the human carpet that covers the floor of the trench. A leg moved disturbs the whole pattern; the sufferer can merely groan, suffer, and wait. When an  (p. 076) attack is on the communication trenches are persistently shelled by the enemy with a view to stop the advance of reinforcements. Once our company lay in a trench as reserves for fourteen hours, and during that time upwards of two thousand shells were hurled in our direction, our trench being half filled with rubble and clay. Two mates, one on my right and one on my left, were wounded. I did not receive a scratch, and Stoner slept for eight whole hours during the cannonade; but this is another story.  Before coming out here I formed an imaginary picture of the trenches, ours and the enemy's, running parallel from the Vosges in the South to the sea in the North. But what a difference I find in the reality. Where I write the trenches run in a strange, eccentric manner. At one point the lines are barely eighty yards apart; the ground there is under water in the wet season; the trench is built of sandbags; all rifle fire is done from loop-holes, for to look over the parapet is to court certain death. A mountain of coal-slack lies between the lines a little further along, which are in \"dead\" ground that cannot be covered by rifle fire, and are 1,200 yards apart. It is here that the sniper plies his trade. He hides somewhere in the slack, and pots  (p. 077) at our men from dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn. He knows the range of every yard of our communication trenches. As we come in we find a warning board stuck up where the parapet is crumbling away. \"Stoop low, sniper,\" and we crouch along head bent until the danger zone is past.  Little mercy is shown to a captured sniper; a short shrift and swift shot is considered meet penalty for the man who coolly and coldly singles out men for destruction day by day. There was one, however, who was saved by Irish hospitality. An Irish Guardsman, cleaning his telescopic-rifle as he sat on the trench banquette, and smoking one of my cigarettes told me the story.  \"The coal slack is festooned with devils of snipers, smart fellows that can shoot round a corner and blast your eye-tooth out at five hundred yards,\" he said. \"They're not all their ones, neither; there's a good sprinkling of our own boys as well. I was doing a wee bit of pot-shot-and-be-damned-to-you work in the other side of the slack, and my eyes open all the time for an enemy's back. There was one near me, but I'm beggared if I could find him. 'I'll not lave this place    (p. 078) till I do,' I says to meself, and spent half the nights I was there prowlin' round like a dog at a fair with my eyes open for the sniper. I came on his post wan night. I smelt him out because he didn't bury his sausage skins as we do, and they stunk like the hole of hell when an ould greasy sinner is a-fryin'. In I went to his sandbagged castle, with me gun on the cock and me finger on the trigger, but he wasn't there; there was nothin' in the place but a few rounds of ball an' a half empty bottle. I was dhry as a bone, and I had a sup without winkin'. 'Mother of Heaven,' I says, when I put down the bottle, 'its little ye know of hospitality, stranger, leaving a bottle with nothin' in it but water. I'll wait for ye, me bucko,' and I lay down in the corner and waited for him to come in.  \"But sorrow the fut of him came, and me waiting there till the colour of day was in the sky. Then I goes back to me own place, and there was he waiting for me. He only made one mistake, he had fallen to sleep, and he just sprung up as I came in be the door.  \"Immediately I had him by the big toe. 'Hands up, Hans'! I said, and he didn't argue, all that he did was to swear like one of ourselves and flop down. 'Why don't ye bury yer sausages, Hans?' I asked     (p. 079) him. 'I smelt yer, me bucko, by what ye couldn't eat. Why didn't ye have something better than water in yer bottle?' I says to him. Dang a Christian word would he answer, only swear, an swear with nothin' bar the pull of me finger betwixt him and his Maker. But, ye know, I had a kind of likin' for him when I thought of him comin' in to my house without as much as yer leave, and going to sleep just as if he was in his own home. I didn't swear back at him but just said, 'This is only a house for wan, but our King has a big residence for ye, so come along before it gets any clearer,' and I took him over to our trenches as stand-to was coming to an end.\"  Referring again to our trenches there is one portion known to me where the lines are barely fifty yards apart, and at the present time the grass is hiding the enemy's trenches; to peep over the parapet gives one the impression of looking on a beautiful meadow splashed with daisy, buttercup, and poppy flower; the whole is a riot of colour--crimson, heliotrope, mauve, and green. What a change from some weeks ago! Then the place was littered with dead bodies, and limp, (p. 080) lifeless figures hung on to the barbed wire where they had been caught in a mad rush to the trenches which they never took. A breeze blows across the meadow as I write, carrying with it the odour of death and perfumed flowers, of aromatic herbs and summer, of desolation and decay. It is good that Nature does her best to blot out all traces of the tragedy between the trenches.  There is a vacant spot in our lines, where there is no trench and none being constructed; why this should be I do not know. But all this ground is under machine-gun fire and within rifle range. No foe would dare to cross the open, and the foe who dared would never live to get through. Further to the right, is a pond with a dead German stuck there, head down, and legs up in air. They tell me that a concussion shell has struck him since and part of his body was blown over to our lines. At present the pond is hidden and the light and shade plays over the kindly grasses that circle round it. On the extreme right there is a graveyard. The trench is deep in dead men's"]]]
