Here and there in the streets he met sentinels and occasionally an airplane sailed overhead. How he envied the men in those airplanes!  He glanced in through broken windows at the interiors of simple abodes which the bestial Huns had devastated. It thrilled him that the boys from America had dragged and driven the enemy out of these homes and would dig their protecting trenches around the other side of this stricken village, like a great embracing arm. It stirred him to think that it was now within the refuge of the American lines and that the arrogant Prussian officers could no longer defile those low, raftered rooms.  He inquired of a sentinel where he could get some gasoline which he would need later.  \"There's a supply station along that road,\" the man said; \"just beyond the clearing.\"  Tom turned in that direction. The road took him out of the village and through a little clump of woods to a clearing where several Americans were guarding a couple of big gasoline tanks--part of the spoils of war. He lingered for a few minutes and then strolled on toward the edge of the denser wood beyond where the firing, though less frequent, could still be heard.  He intended to go just far enough into this wood for a glimpse of the forest shade which his scouting had taught him to love, and then to return to headquarters for his machine.  Crossing a plank bridge across a narrow stream, he paused in the edge of the woods and listened to the firing which still occurred at intervals in the higher ground beyond. He knew that the fighting there was of the old-fashioned sort, from behind protecting trees and wooded hillocks, something like the good old fights of Indians and buckskin scouts away home in the wild west of America. And he could not repress his impulse to venture farther into the solitude.  [Illustration: TOM SLIPPED BEHIND A TREE AND WATCHED THE MAN WHO PAUSED LIKE A STARTLED ANIMAL.]  The stream which he had crossed had evidently its source in the more densely wooded hills beyond and he followed it on its narrowing way up toward the locality where the fighting seemed now to be going on. Once a group of khaki-clad figures passed stealthily among the trees, intent upon some quest. The sight of their rifles reminded Tom that he was himself in danger, but he reflected that he was in no greater danger than they and that he had with him the small arm which all messengers carried.  A little farther on he espied an American concealed behind a tree, who nodded his head perfunctorily as Tom passed, seeming to discourage any spoken greeting.  The path of the stream led into an area of thick undergrowth covering the side of a gentle slope where the water tumbled down in little falls. He must be approaching very near to the source, he thought, for the stream was becoming a mere trickle, picking its way around rocky obstacles in a very jungle of thick underbrush.  Suddenly he stopped at a slight rustling sound very near him.  It was the familiar sound which he had so often heard away back in the Adirondack woods, of some startled creature scurrying to shelter.  He was the scout again now, standing motionless and silent--keenly waiting. Then, to his amazement, a clump of bushes almost at his feet stirred slightly. He waited still, watching, his heart in his mouth. Could it have been the breeze? But there was no breeze.  Startled, but discreetly motionless, he fixed his eyes upon the leafy clump, still waiting. Presently it stirred again, very perceptibly now, then moved, clumsily and uncannily, and with a slight rustling of its leaves, along the bank of the stream!     CHAPTER NINE  THE MYSTERIOUS FUGITIVE   Suddenly the thing stopped, and its whole bulk was shaken very noticeably. Then a head emerged from it and before Tom could realize what had happened a German soldier was fully revealed, brushing the leaves and dirt from his gray coat as he stole cautiously along the edge of the stream, peering anxiously about him and pausing now and again to listen.  He was already some distance from Tom, whom apparently he had not discovered, and his stealthy movements suggested that he was either in the act of escaping or was bent upon some secret business of importance.  Without a sound Tom slipped behind a tree and watched the man who paused like a startled animal at every few steps, watching and listening.  Tom knew that, notwithstanding his non-combatant status, he was quite justified in drawing his pistol upon this fleeing Boche, but before he had realized this the figure had gone too far to afford him much hope of success with the small weapon which he was not accustomed to. Moreover, just because he _was_ a \"non-com\" he balked at using it. If he should miss, he thought, the man might turn upon him and with a surer aim lay him low.  But there was one thing in which Tom Slade felt himself to be the equal of any German that lived, and that was stalking. Here, in the deep woods, among these protecting trees, he felt at home, and the lure of scouting was upon him now. No one could lose him; no one could get away from him. And a bird in the air would make no more noise than he!  Swiftly, silently, he slipped from one tree to another, his keen eye always fixed upon the fleeting figure and his ears alert to learn if, perchance, the Boche was being pursued. Not a sound could he hear except that of the distant shooting.  It occurred to him that the precaution of camouflaging might be useful to him also, and he silently disposed one of the leafy boughs which the German had left diagonally across his breast with the fork over his shoulder so that it formed a sort of adjustable screen, more portable and less clumsy than the leafy mound which had covered the Boche.  With this he stole along, sometimes hiding behind trees, sometimes crouching among the rocks along the bank, and keeping at an even distance from the man. His method with its personal dexterity was eloquent of the American scout, just as the Boche, under his mound of foliage, had been typical of the German who depends largely upon _device_ and little upon personal skill and dexterity.  The scout from Temple Camp had his ruses, too, for once when the German, startled by a fancied sound, seemed about to look behind him, Tom dexterously hurled a stone far to the left of his quarry, which diverted the man's attention to that direction and kept it there while Tom, gliding this way and that and raising or lowering his scant disguise, crept after him.  They were now in an isolated spot and the distant firing seemed farther and farther away. The stream, reduced to a mere trickle, worked its way down among rocks and the German followed its course closely. What he was about in this sequestered jungle Tom could not imagine, unless, indeed, he was fleeing from his own masters. But surely open surrender to the Americans would have been safer than that, and Tom remembered how readily those other German soldiers had rushed into the arms of himself and his companions.  Moreover, the more overgrown the brook became and the more involved its path, the more the hurrying German seemed bent upon following it and instead of finding any measure of relief from anxiety in this isolated place, he appeared more anxious than ever and peered carefully about him at every few steps.  At length, to Tom's astonishment, he stepped across the brook and felt of a clump of bush which grew on the bank. Could he have expected to find another camouflaged figure, Tom wondered?  Whatever he was after, he apparently thought he had reached his destination for he now moved hurriedly about, feeling the single bushes and moving among the larger clumps as if in quest of something. After a few moments he paused as if perplexed and moved farther up the stream. And Tom, who had been crouching behind a bush at a safe distance, crept silently to another one, greatly puzzled but watching him closely.  Selecting another spot, the Boche moved about among the bushes as before, carefully examining each one which stood by itself. Tom expected every minute to see some grim, gray-coated figure step out of his leafy retreat to join his comrade, but why such a person should wait to be discovered Tom could not comprehend, for he must have heard and probably seen this beating through the bushes.  An especially symmetrical bush stood on the brink of the stream and after poking about this as usual, the German stood upon tiptoe, apparently looking down into it, then kneeled at its base while Tom watched from his hiding-place.  Suddenly a sharp report rang out and the German jumped to his feet, clutched frantically at the brush which seemed to furnish a substantial support, then reeled away and fell headlong into the brook, where he lay motionless.  The heedless current, adapting itself readily to this grim obstruction, bubbled gaily around the gray, crumpled form, accelerating its cheery progress in the narrow path and showing little glints of red in its crystal, dancing ripples.     CHAPTER TEN  THE JERSEY SNIPE   Tom hurried to the prostrate figure and saw that the German was quite dead. There was no other sign of human presence and not a sound to be heard but the rippling of the clear water at his feet.  For a few moments he stood, surprised and silent, listening. Then he fancied that he heard a rustling in the bushes some distance away and he looked in that direction, standing motionless, alert for the slightest stir.  Suddenly there emerged out of the undergrowth a hundred or more feet distant a strange looking figure clad in a dull shade of green with a green skull cap and a green scarf, like a scout scarf, loosely thrown about his neck. Even the rifle which he carried jauntily over his shoulder was green in color, so that he seemed to Tom to have that general hue which things assume when seen through green spectacles. He was lithe and agile, gliding through the bushes as if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19495"],["title","Tom Slade, Motorcycle Dispatch Bearer (#7)"],["body"," were a part of them, and he came straight toward Tom, with a nimbleness which almost rivalled that of a squirrel.  There was something about his jaunty, light step which puzzled Tom and he narrowed his eyes, watching the approaching figure closely. The stranger removed a cigarette from his mouth to enable him the better to lay his finger upon his lips, imposing silence, and as he did so the movement of his hand and his way of holding the cigarette somehow caused Tom to stare.  Then his puzzled scrutiny gave way to an expression of blank amazement, as again the figure raised his finger to his lips to anticipate any impulse of Tom's to call. Nor did Tom violate this caution until the stranger was within a dozen feet or so.  \"Roscoe--Bent!\" he ejaculated. \"Don't you know me? I'm Tom Slade.\"  \"Well--I'll--be----\" Roscoe began, then broke off, holding Tom at arm's length and looking at him incredulously. \"Tom Slade--_I'll be--jiggered_!\"  \"I kinder knew it was you,\" said Tom in his impassive way, \"as soon as I saw you take that cigarette out of your mouth, 'cause you do it such a swell way, kind of,\" he added, ingenuously; \"just like the way you used to when you sat on the window-sill in Temple Camp office and jollied Margaret Ellison. Maybe you don't remember.\"  Still Roscoe held him at arm's length, smiling all over his handsome, vivacious face. Then he removed one of his hands from Tom's shoulder and gave him a push in the chest in the old way.  \"It's the same old Tom Slade, I'll be---- And with the front of your belt away around at the side, as usual. This is better than taking a hundred prisoners. How are you and how'd you get here, you sober old tow-head, you?\" and he gripped Tom's hand with impulsive vehemence. \"This sure does beat all! I might have known if I found you at all it would be in the woods, you old pathfinder!\" and he gave Tom another shove, then rapped him on the shoulder and slipped his hand around his neck in a way all his own.  \"I--I like to hear you talk that way,\" said Tom, with that queer dullness which Roscoe liked; \"it reminds me of old times.\"  \"Kind of?\" prompted Roscoe, laughing. \"Is our friend here dead?\"  \"Yes, he's very dead,\" said Tom soberly, \"but I think there are others around in the bushes.\"  \"There are some enemies there,\" said Roscoe, \"but we won't kill them. Contemptible murderers!\" he muttered, as he hauled the dead Boche out of the stream. \"I'll pick you off one by one, as fast as you come up here, you gang of back-stabbers! Look here,\" he added.  \"I got to admit you can do it,\" said Tom with frank admiration.  Roscoe pulled away the shrubbery where the German had been kneeling when he was struck and there was revealed a great hogshead, larger, Tom thought, than any he had ever seen.  \"That's the kind of weapons they fight with,\" Roscoe said, disgustedly. \"Look here,\" he added, pulling the foliage away still more. \"Don't touch it. See? It leads down from another one. It's poison.\"  Tom, staring, understood well enough now, and he peered into the bushes about him in amazement as he heard Roscoe say,  \"Arsenic, the sneaky beasts.\"  \"See what he was going to do?\" he added, startling Tom out of his silent wondering. \"There's half a dozen or more of these hogsheads in those bushes. As fast as this one empties it fills up again from another that stands higher. There's a whole nest of them here. See how the pipe from this one leads into the stream?\"  \"What's the wire for?\" said Tom.  \"Oh, that's so's they can open this little cock here, see? Start the thing going. Don't pull away the camouflage. There may be another chap up here in a little while, to see what's the matter. _Tommy'll_ take care of them all right, won't you, _Tommy_?\"  \"Do you mean me?\" Tom asked.  \"I mean your namesake here,\" Roscoe said, slapping his rifle. \"I named it after you, you old glum head. Remember how you told me a feller couldn't aim straight, _kind of_\" (he mimicked Tom's tone). \"You said a feller couldn't aim straight, _kind of_, if he smoked cigarettes.\"  \"I got to admit I was wrong,\" said Tom.  \"You bet you have! Jingoes, it's good to hear you talk!\" Roscoe laughed. \"How in the world did you get here, anyway?\"  \"I'll tell you all about it,\" said Tom, \"only first tell me, are you the feller they call the Jersey Snipe?\"  \"Snipy, for short,\" said Roscoe.  \"Then maybe you saved my life already,\" said Tom, \"out in No Man's Land.\"  \"Were you the kid on that wheel?\" Roscoe asked, surprised.  \"Yes, and I always knew you'd make a good soldier. I told everybody so.\"  \"_Kind of?_ Tommy, old boy, don't forget it was _you_ made me a soldier,\" Roscoe said soberly. \"Come on back to my perch with me,\" he added, \"and tell me all about your adventures. This is better than taking Berlin. There's only one person in this little old world I'd rather meet in a lonely place, and that's the Kaiser. Come on--quiet now.\"  \"You don't think you can show _me_ how to stalk, do you?\" said Tom.     CHAPTER ELEVEN  ON GUARD   \"You see it was this way,\" said Roscoe after hie had scrambled with amazing agility up to his \"perch\" in a tree several hundred feet distant but in full view of the stream. Tom had climbed up after him and was looking with curious pleasure at the little kit of rations and other personal paraphernalia which hung from neighboring branches. \"How do you like my private camp? Got Temple Camp beat, hey?\" he broke off in that erratic way of his. \"All the comforts of home. Come on, get into your camouflage.\"  \"You don't seem the same as when you used to come up to our office from the bank downstairs--that's one sure thing,\" said Tom, pulling the leaves about him.  \"You thought all I was good for was to jolly Margaret Ellison, huh?\"  \"I see now that you didn't only save my life but lots of other fellers', too,\" said Tom. \"Go on, you started to tell me about it.\"  It was very pleasant and cosy up there in the sniper's perch where Roscoe had gathered the thinner branches about him, forming a little leafy lair, in which his agile figure and his quick glances about reminded Tom for all the world of a squirrel. He could hardly believe that this watchful, dexterous creature, peering cautiously out of his romantic retreat, was the same Roscoe Bent who used to make fun of the scouts and sneak upstairs to smoke cigarettes in the Temple Camp office; who thought as much of his spotless high collar then as he seemed to think of his rifle now.  \"I got to thank you because you named it after me,\" said Tom.  \"And I _got to thank you_ that you gave me the chance to get it to name after you, Tommy. Well, you see it was this way,\" Roscoe went on in a half whisper; \"there were half a dozen of us over here in the woods and we'd just cleaned out a machine gun nest when we saw this miniature forest moving along. I thought it was a decorated moving van.\"  \"That's the trouble with them,\" agreed Tom; \"they're no good in the woods; they're clumsy. They're punk scouts.\"  \"Scouts!\" Roscoe chuckled. \"If we had to fight this gang of cut-throats and murderers in the woods where old What's-his-name--Custer--had to fight the Indians, take it from me, we'd have them wiped up in a month. That fellow's idea of camouflaging was to bury himself under a couple of tons of green stuff and then move the whole business along like a clumsy old Zeppelin. I can camouflage myself with a branch with ten leaves on it by studying the light.\"  \"Anybody can see you've learned something about scouting--that's one sure thing,\" said Tom proudly.  \"_One sure thing!_\" Roscoe laughed inaudibly. \"It's the same old Tommy Slade. Well, I was just going to bean this geezer when my officer told me I'd better follow him.\"  \"I was following him, too,\" said Tom; \"stalking is the word you ought to use.\"  \"Captain thought he might be up to something special. So I followed--_stalked_--how's that?\"  \"All right.\"  \"So I stalked him and when I saw he was following the stream I made a detour and waited for him right here. You see what he was up to? Way down in Cantigny they could turn a switch and start this blamed poison, half a dozen hogsheads of it, flowing into the stream. They waited till they lost the town before they turned the switch, and they probably thought they could poison us Americans by wholesale. Maybe they had some reason to think the blamed thing hadn't worked, and sent this fellow up. I beaned him just as he was going to turn the stop-cock.\"  \"Maybe you saved a whole lot of lives, hey?\" said Tom proudly.  Roscoe shrugged his shoulder in that careless way he had. \"I'll be glad to meet any more that come along,\" he said.  It was well that Tom Slade's first sight of deliberate killing was in connection with so despicable a proceeding as the wholesale poisoning of a stream. He could feel no pity for the man who, fleeing from those who fought cleanly and like men instead of beasts, had sought to pour this potent liquid of anguish and death into the running crystal water. Such acts, it seemed to him, were quite removed from the sphere of honorable, manly fighting.  As a scout he had learned that it was wrong even to bathe in a stream whence drinking water was obtained, and at camp he had always scrupulously observed this good rule. He felt that it was cowardly to defile the waters of a brook. It was not a \"mailed fist\" at all which could do such things, but a fist dripping with poison.  And Tom Slade felt no qualm, as otherwise he might have felt, at hiding there waiting for new victims. He was proud and thrilled to see his friend, secreted in his perch, keen-eyed and alert, guarding alone the crystal purity of this laughing, life-giving brook, as it hurried along its pebbly bed and tumbled in little gushing falls and wound cheerily around the rocks, bearing its grateful refreshment to the weary, thirsty boys who were holding the neighboring village.  \"I used to think I wouldn't like to be a sniper,\" he said, \"but now it seems different. I saw two fellers in the village and"]]]
