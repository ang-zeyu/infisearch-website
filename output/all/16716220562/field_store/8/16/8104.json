Lady--in the forest seek'st thou aught?     At thy sight we stand confounded--art thou of our mortal race?     Of this wood art thou the goddess?--of this mountain? of that plain?     Who art thou, O noble Lady--thee, our refuge, we adore.     Art thou sylvan nymph or genius--or celestial nymph divine?     Every-way regard our welfare--and protect us, undespised:     So our caravan in safety--may pursue its onward way,     So ordain it, O illustrious!--that good fortune wait on all.\"     Thus addressed by that assemblage--Damayanti, kingly-born,     Answered thus with gentle language--grieving for her husband lost.     Of that caravan the leader--and the whole assembled host,     Youths and boys, and grey-haired elders--and the guides, thus answered she:     \"Know me, like yourselves, a mortal--daughter of a king of men,     Of another king the consort--seeking for my royal lord;     Know, Vidarbha's king, my father--and Nishadha's king, my lord,     Nala, is his name, the glorious--him, th' unconquered do I seek;     Know ye aught of that good monarch--tell me, quick, of my beloved,     Of the tiger hero, Nala--slayer of a host of foes.\"       Of the caravan the captain--thus the lovely-limbed addressed,     Suchi was his name, the merchant--\"Hear, illustrious queen, my speech;     Of this caravan the captain--I, O Lady with sweet smile,     Him that bears the name of Nala--nowhere have these eyes beheld.     Elephants, and pards, and tigers--lynxes, buffaloes, and bears,     See I in this trackless forest--uninhabited by men;     Save thyself, of human feature--nought, or human form, I've seen.     So may he, the king of Yakshas--Manibhadra, guard us well.\"[91]     To the merchants then she answered--to the leader of the host,     \"Tell me whither do ye travel!--whither bound your caravan?\"      _The_ CAPTAIN _of the caravan spake._      \"To the realm of Chedi's sovereign[92]--truth-discerning Subahu,     Soon this caravan will enter--travelling in search of gain.\"     BOOK XIII.       [93]This, the lovely princess hearing--from the captain of the band,     With the caravan set forward--seeking still her royal lord.     Long their journey through the forest--through the dark and awful glens;     Then a lake of loveliest beauty--fragrant with the lotus flowers,     Saw those merchants, wide and pleasant--with fresh grass and shady trees;     Flowers and fruits bedecked its borders--where the birds melodious sang:     In its clear delicious waters--soul-enchanting, icy cool,     With their horses all o'erwearied--thought they then to plunge and bathe;     At the signal of the captain--entered all that pleasant grove.     At the close of day arriving--there encamped they for the night.       When the midnight came, all noiseless--came in silence deep and still,     Weary slept the band of merchants--lo, a herd of elephants,[94]     Oozing moisture from their temples--came to drink the troubled stream.     When that caravan they gazed on--with their slumbering beasts at rest,     The tame elephants they scented--those wild forest elephants;     Forward rush they fleet and furious--mad to slay, and wild with heat;     Irresistible the onset--of the rushing ponderous beasts,     As the peaks from some high mountain--down the valley thundering roll;     Strewn was all the way before them--with the boughs, the trunks of trees;     On they crash'd to where the travellers--slumbered by the lotus lake.     Trampled down without a struggle--helpless on the earth they lay,     \"Woe, oh, woe!\" shrieked out the merchants--wildly some began to fly,     In the forest thickets' plunging;--some stood gasping, blind with sleep;     And the elephants down beat them--with their tusks, their trunks, their         feet.     Many saw their camels dying--mingled with the men on foot,     And in frantic tumult rushing--wildly struck each other down;     Many miserably shrieking--cast them down upon the earth,     Many climbed the trees in terror--on the rough ground stumbled some.     Thus in various wise and fatal--by the elephants assailed,     Lay that caravan so wealthy--scattered all abroad or slain.     Such, so fearful was the tumult--the three worlds seemed all appalled,[95]     \"'Tis a fire amid th' encampment--save ye, fly ye, for your lives.     Lo, your precious pearls ye trample--take them up, why fly so fast?     Save them, 'tis a common venture--fear ye not that I deceive.\"     Thus t' each other shrieked the merchants--as in fear they scattered round.     \"Yet again I call upon you--cowards! think ye what ye do.\"     All around this frantic carnage--raging through the prostrate host,     Damayanti, soon awakened--with her heart all full of dread;     There she saw a hideous slaughter--the whole world might well appal.     To such sights all unfamiliar--gazed the queen with lotus eyes,     Pressing in her breath with terror--slowly rose she on her feet.     And the few that scaped the carnage--few that scaped without a wound,     All at once exclaimed together--\"Of whose deeds is this the doom?     Hath not mighty Manibhadra--adoration meet received.     And Vaisravana the holy[96]--of the Yakshas lord and king,     Have not all that might impede us--ere we journied, been addressed?     Was it doomed, that all good omens--by this chance should be belied!     Were no planets haply adverse?--how hath fate, like this, befall'n!\"     Others answered in their misery--reft of kindred and of wealth,     \"Who is that ill-omened woman--that with maniac-staring eyes,     Joined our host, misshaped in aspect--and with scarcely human form?     Surely all this wicked witchcraft--by her evil power is wrought;     Witch or sorceress she, or d√¶mon--fatal cause of all our fears,     Hers is all the guilt, the misery--who such damning proof may doubt?     Could we but behold that false one--murtheress, bane of all our host,     With the clods, the dust, the bamboos--with our staves, or with our hands,     We would slay her on the instant--of our caravan the fate.\"     But no sooner Damayanti--their appalling words had heard,     In her shame and in her terror--to the forest shade she fled.     And that guilt imputed dreading--thus her fate began to wail:     \"Woe is me, still o'er me hovers--the terrific wrath of fate;     No good fortune e'er attends me--of what guilt is this the doom?     Not a sin can I remember--not the least to living man.     Or in deed, or thought, or language--of what guilt is this the doom?     In some former life committed[97]--expiate I now the sin.     To this infinite misfortune--hence by penal justice doomed?     Lost my husband, lost my kingdom--from my kindred separate;     Separate from noble Nala--from my children far away,     Widowed of my rightful guardian--in the serpent-haunted wood.\"       Of that caravan at morning--then the sad surviving few,     Setting forth from that dread region--o'er that hideous carnage grieve;     Each a brother mourns, or father--or a son, or dearest friend,     Still Vidarbha's princess uttered--\"What the sin that I have done?     Scarcely in this desert forest--had I met this host of men,     By the elephants they perish--this is through my luckless fate;     A still lengthening life of sorrow--I henceforth must sadly lead.     Ere his destined day none dieth--this of aged seers the lore;     Therefore am not I too trampled--by this herd of furious beasts.     Every deed of living mortal--by over-ruling fate is done.     Yet no sin have I committed--in my blameless infancy,     To deserve this dire disaster--or in word, or deed, or thought.     For the choosing of my husband--are the guardians of the world,     Angry are the gods, rejected--for the noble Nala's sake?     From my lord this long divorcement--through their power do I endure.\"     Thus the noblest of all women--to bewail her fate began,     The deserted Damayanti--with these sad and bitter words;     With some Veda-reading Brahmins--that survived that scattered host,     Then she went her way in sadness--like the young moon's sickle pale,     And ere long a mighty city--that afflicted queen drew near:     'Twas the king of Chedi's city--truth-discerning Subahu.     Scantly clad in half a garment--entered she that stately town;     Her disturbed, emaciate, wretched--with dishevelled hair, unwashed,     Like a maniac, onward-moving--saw that city's wondering throng;     Gazing on her as she entered--to the monarch's royal seat;     All the boys her footsteps followed--in their curious gamesome play;[98]     Circled round by these she wandered--near the royal palace gate.     From that palace lofty terrace--her the mother of the king     Saw, and thus her nurse addressed she--\"Go, and lead that wanderer in!     Sad she roves, without a refuge--troubled by those gazing men;     Yet in form so bright, irradiate--is our palace where she moves.     Though so maniac-like, half-clothed--like Heaven's long-eyed queen she         seems.\"     She those crowding men dispersing--quickly to the palace top     Made her mount--and in amazement--her the mother-queen addressed:     \"Thus though bowed and worn with sorrow--such a shining form thou wear'st,     As through murky clouds the lightning--tell me who thou art and whence:     For thy form is more than human--of all ornament despoiled:     Men thou fear'st not, unattended--in celestial beauty safe.\"       Hearing thus her gentle language--Bhima's daughter made reply,     \"Know me like thyself a mortal--a distressed, devoted wife;     Of illustrious race an handmaid--making where I will mine home;     On the roots and wild-fruits feeding--lonely, at the fall of eve.     Gifted with unnumber'd virtues--is my true, my faithful lord,     And I still the hero followed--like his shadow on the way.     'Twas his fate, with desp'rate fondness--to pursue the love of play,     And in play subdued and ruined--entered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],["title","Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#8)"],["body","yon lonely wood;     Him, arrayed in but one garment,--like a madman wandering wild,     To console my noble husband--I too entered the deep wood;     He within that dreary forest--for some cause, to me unknown,     Wild with hunger, reft of reason--that one single robe he lost.     I with but one robe, him naked[99]--frantic, and with mind diseased,     Following through the boundless forest--many a night I had not slept;     Then, when I had sunk to slumber--me the blameless leaving there,     Half my garment having severed--he his sinless consort fled;     Seeking him, my outcast husband--night and day am I consumed:     Him I see not, ever shining--like the lotus cup, beloved;     Find him not, most like th' immortals--lord of all, my life, my soul.\"       Even as thus, with eyes o'erflowing--uttered she her sad lament,     Sad herself, sad Bhima's daughter--did the mother queen address:     \"Dwell with me, then, noble Lady--deep the joy in thee I feel,     And the servants of my household--shall thy royal husband seek;     Haply hither he may wander--as he roams about the world:     Dwelling here in peace and honour--thou thy husband wilt rejoin.\"       To the king of Chedi's mother--Damayanti made reply;     \"On these terms, O nurse of heroes!--I with thee may make abode:     That I eat not broken victuals[100]--wash not feet with menial hand:[101]     Nor with stranger men have converse--in my chaste, secluded state;     If that any man demand me--be he punished; if again,     Be he put to death on th' instant--this the vow that I have sworn.     Only, if they seek my husband--holy Brahmins will I see.     Be my terms by thee accepted--gladly will I sojourn here,     But on other terms no sojourn--will this heart resolved admit.\"       Then to her with joyful spirit--spake the mother of the king:     \"As thou wilt shall all be ordered--be thou blest, since such thy vow.\"     Speaking thus to Bhima's daughter--did the royal mother then,     In these words address her daughter--young Sunanda was her name:     \"See this handmaid, my Sunanda--gifted with a form divine;     She in age thy lovely compeer--be she to thee as a friend;     Joined with her in sweet communion--take thy pleasure without fear.\"     Young Sunanda, all rejoicing--to her own abode went back,     Taking with her Damayanti--circled with her virgin peers.     BOOK XIV.       Damayanti when deserting--royal Nala fled, ere long     Blazing in the forest jungle--he a mighty fire beheld;     Thence as of a living being--from the midst a voice he heard:     \"Hasten, Nala!\" oft and loudly--\"Punyasloka, haste,\" it cried.     \"Fear thou not,\" king Nala answered--plunging in the ruddy flame;     There he saw the king of serpents--lying, coiled into a ring.     There with folded hands the serpent--trembling, thus to Nala spake:     \"Me, Karkotaka, the Serpent--know, thou sovereign of men;     Narada, the famous hermit[102]--I deceived, the holy sage;     He in righteous indignation--smote me with this awful curse:     Stay thou there as one unmoving--till king Nala passing by,     Lead thee hence; save only Nala--none can free thee from this curse.     Through this potent execration--I no step have power to move;     I the way to bliss will show thee--if thou sav'st me from this fate.     I will show thee noble friendship--serpent none is like to me;     Lightly shall I weigh, uplift me--in thy hand, with speed, O king.\"     Thus when spake the king of serpents--to a finger's size he shrank;     Him when Nala lightly lifted--to the unburning space he passed.     To the air all cool and temperate--brought him, by the flame unreached.     As he fain on th' earth would place him--thus Karkotaka began.     \"Move thou now, O king, and slowly--as thou movest, count thy steps.     Then the best of all good fortune--will I give thee, mighty armed!\"     Ere the tenth step he had counted[103]--him the sudden serpent bit:     As he bit him, on the instant--all his kingly form was changed.     There he stood, and gazed in wonder--Nala, on his altered form.     In his proper shape the serpent--saw the sovereign of men.     Then Karkotaka the serpent--thus to Nala comfort spake:     \"Through my power thy form is altered--lest thou should'st be known of men.     He through whom thou'rt thus afflicted--Nala, with intensest grief,     Through my poison, shall in anguish--ever dwell within thy soul.     All his body steeped in poison--till he free thee from thy woe,     Shall he dwell within thee prison'd--in the ecstacy of pain.     So from him, by whom, thou blameless!--sufferest such unworthy wrong,     By the curse I lay upon him--my deliverance shall be wrought.     Fear not thou the tusked wild boar--foeman fear not thou, O king,     Neither Brahmin fear, nor Sages[104]--safe through my prevailing power.     King, this salutary poison--gives to thee nor grief nor pain;     In the battle, chief of Rajas--victory is ever thine.     Go thou forth, thyself thus naming--Vahuca, the charioteer,     To the royal Rituparna--in the dice all-skilful he;     To Ayodhya's pleasant city--sovereign of Nishadha! go;     He his skill in dice will give thee--for thy skill in taming steeds:     Of Ikshw√†ku's noble lineage--he will be thy best of friends.     Thou the skill in dice possessing--soon wilt rise again to bliss;     With thy consort reunited--yield not up thy soul to grief.     Thou thy kingdom, thou thy children--wilt regain, the truth I speak.     When again thou would'st behold thee--in thy proper form, O king,     Summon me to thy remembrance--and this garment put thou on:     In this garment clad resum'st thou--instantly thy proper form.\"     Saying thus, of vests celestial--gave he to the king a pair.[105]     And king Nala, thus instructed--gifted with these magic robes,     Instantly the king of serpents--vanished from his sight away.     BOOK XV.       Vanished thus the King of Serpents--set Nishadha's raja forth,     Rituparna's royal city--on the tenth day entered he.     Straight before the royal presence--\"Vahuca am I,\" he said,     \"In the skill of taming horses--on the earth is not my peer;     Use me, where the difficult counsel--where thou want'st the dexterous hand;     In the art of dressing viands[106]--I am skilful above all.     Whatsoe'er the art, whatever--be most difficult to do,     I will strive to execute it--take me to thy service, king.\"      RITUPARNA _spake_.      \"Vahuca, I bid thee welcome--all this service shalt thou do,     On my horses' rapid motion--deeply is my mind engaged.     Take thou then on thee the office--that my steeds be fleet of foot,     Of my horse be thou the master--hundred hundreds is thy pay:[107]     Ever shalt thou have for comrades--Varshneya and Jivala:     With these two pursue thy pleasure--Vahuca, abide with me.\"     Thus addressed, did Nala, honoured--by king Rituparna long,     With Varshneya in that city--and with Jivala abide:     There abode he, sadly thinking--of Vidarbha's daughter still.     In the evening, every evening--uttered he this single verse;     \"Where is she, by thirst and hunger--worn, and weary, pious still,     Thinking of her unwise husband--in whose presence is she now!\"     Thus the raja, ever speaking--Jivala one night addressed;     \"Who is she, for whom thou grievest?--Vahuca, I fain would hear.\"     [108]Answered thus the royal Nala--\"To a man of sense bereft,     Once belonged a peerless lady--most infirm of word was he;     From some cause from her dissevered--went that frantic man away,     In his foolish soul thus parted--wanders he, by sorrow racked;     Night and day, and still for ever--by his parching grief consumed:     Nightly brooding o'er his sorrows--sings he this sad single verse.     O'er the whole wide earth a wanderer--chance-alighting in some place,     Dwells that woful man, unworthy,--ever wakeful with his grief.     Him that noble lady following--in the forest lone and dread,     Lives, of that bad man forsaken--hard it is to say, she lives!     Lone, and young, the ways unknowing--undeserving of such fate,     Pines she there with thirst and hunger--hard it is to say, she lives.     In that vast and awful forest--haunted by fierce beasts of prey,     By her lord she roams forsaken--hapless, by that luckless lord.\"     Thus remembering Damayanti--did Nishadha's king unknown,     Long within that dwelling sojourn--in the palace of the king.     BOOK XVI.       Nala thus bereft of kingdom--with his wife to slavery sunk,     Forth king Bhima sent the Brahmins--Nala through the world to seek.     Thus the royal Bhima charged them--with abundant wealth supplied:--     \"Go ye now and seek king Nala--Damayanti seek, my child:     And, achieved this weighty business--found Nishadha's royal lord,     Whosoe'er shall hither bring them--shall a thousand kine receive;     And a royal grant for maintenance[109]--of a village like a town.     If nor hither Damayanti--nor king Nala may be brought,     Know we where they are, rich guerdon--still we give, ten hundred kine.\"     Thus addressed, the joyful Brahmins--went to every clime of earth,     Through the cities, through the kingdoms--seeking Nala and his queen:     Nala, or king Bhima's daughter--in no place might they behold.     Then a Brahmin, named Sudeva--came to pleasant Chedi-pur;     There within the kingly palace--he Vidarbha's daughter saw,     Standing with the fair Sunanda--on a royal holiday.[110]     With her beauty once so peerless--worthy now of little praise,     Like the sun-light feebly shining--through the dimness of a cloud.     Gazing on the large-eyed princess--dull in look, and wasted still,     Lo, he thought, king Bhima's daughter--pondering thus within his mind.--      SUDEVA _spake_.      \"Even as once I wont to see her--such is yonder woman's form,     I my work have done, beholding--like the goddess world-adored,     Like the full moon, darkly beauteous--with her fair and swelling"]]]
