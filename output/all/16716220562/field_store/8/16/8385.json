I'm sure she wouldn't keep you waiting. And the house is only a step from the main street--can't we take her?\"  So Margaret was added to the party that sped on to the ferry. To everybody's surprise, when they reached the New York end of the ferry Edward Watkins signalled the chauffeur to stop.  \"Roger telephoned Tom and Della about the baby,\" he explained, \"and about your coming in today and I thought perhaps I might do something to help. I don't want to intrude--\"  \"We're going to the School of Mothercraft,\" said Mrs. Morton, \"and we'd be glad to have you go with us. I don't know that we shall need to call on your professional advice but if you can spare the time we'd like to have you.\"  \"Unfortunately, time is the commodity I'm richest in,\" smiled the young doctor, taking the seat beside the chauffeur.  The ride up town was a pleasure to the girls who did not often come to the city, and then seldom had an opportunity to ride in any automobile but a taxi-cab. As soon as possible they swung in to Fifth Avenue, whose brilliant shop windows and swiftly moving traffic excited them. They were quite thrilled when they drew up before a pretty house, no different in appearance from any of its neighbors, except that an unobtrusive sign notified seekers that they had found the right place.  \"It's a school to learn home-making in,\" Helen explained to Margaret in a low tone as they followed the elders up the steps, \"so it ought to be in a real house and not a schoolhouse-y place.\"  Margaret nodded, for they were being ushered into a cheerful reception room, simply but attractively furnished. In a minute they were being greeted by the Director who remembered meeting at Chautauqua all of them except Edward, and she recalled other members of his family and especially the Watkins bull-dog, Cupid, who was a prominent figure in Chautauqua life.  Mrs. Morton explained their errand, and also the reasons that had brought so large a number of them to the School.  \"We're a deputation representing several families and a club, all of which are interested in the baby, but I should like to have the young woman you select for us understand that we are going to rely on her knowledge and skill, and that she won't be called to account by a council of war every time she washes the baby's face.\"  The Director smiled.  \"I quite understand,\" she said. \"I think I know just the young woman you want. She finished her course here last May, and then she went with me to Chautauqua for the summer and helped me there with the work we did in measurements and in making out food schedules and so on for children whose mothers brought them to us for our advice. Miss Merriam--Gertrude Merriam is her name--is taking just one course here now, and I think she'll be willing to give it up and glad to undertake the care of a baby that needs such special attention as your little waif.\"  The whole party followed the Director upstairs and looked over with interest the scientifically appointed rooms. There was a kindergarten where those of the children in the house who were old enough, together with a few from outside, were taught in the morning hours. The nursery with its spotless white beds and furniture and its simple and appropriate pictures was as good to look at as a hospital ward, \"and a lot pleasanter,\" said Dr. Watkins. Out of it opened a wee roof garden and there a few of the children dressed in thick coats and warm hoods were playing, while a sweet-faced young woman sitting on the floor seemed quite at home with them. She tried to rise as the Director's party came out unexpectedly on her. Her foot caught in her skirt and Dr. Watkins sprang forward to give her a helping hand.  \"This is Miss Merriam of whom I was speaking,\" said the Director, introducing her. \"Will you ask Miss Morgan to come out here with the children and will you join us in the study?\" she asked.  Miss Merriam assented and when her successor arrived the flock went in again to see the children's dining-room and the arrangements made for doing special cooking for such of them as needed it.  \"We try not to have elaborate equipment,\" explained the Director. \"I want my young women to be able to work with what any mother provides for her home and not to be dependent on machines and utensils that are seldom found outside of hospitals. They are learning thoroughly the scientific side. Miss Merriam, who, I hope, will go to you, is a college graduate, and in college she studied biology and food values and ventilation and sanitation and such matters. Since she has been here she has reviewed all that work under the physicians who lecture here, and she has practised first aid and made a special study of infant requirements. You couldn't have any one better trained for what you need.\"  Dr. Watkins gave his chair to Miss Merriam when she came to join the conference, and asked Mrs. Morton by a motion of the eyebrows if he should withdraw. When her reply was negative he sat down again. Miss Merriam blushed as she faced the group but she was entirely at her ease. Mrs. Morton explained their need.  \"A Belgian baby!\" she cried. \"And you want me to take care of her! Why, Mrs. Morton, there's nothing in the world I should like better. The poor little dud! When shall I go to you?\"  \"Just as soon as you can,\" replied Mrs. Morton. \"We've left her today in charge of my little boy's old nurse, but as soon as you come we shall move her to my sister-in-law's.\"  Miss Merriam turned inquiringly to Mrs. Smith, who smiled in return.  \"Mrs. Smith has only her daughter and herself in her family so she has more space in her house than I have.\"  \"But it's just round the corner from us so we can see the baby every day,\" cried Helen.  \"I can go to Rosemont early tomorrow morning,\" said Miss Merriam. \"Tell me, please, how to reach there.\"  She glanced at Mrs. Morton, but Dr. Watkins answered her.  \"If you'll allow me,\" he said; \"I have an errand in Rosemont tomorrow and I'd be very glad to show you the way.\"  Miss Merriam's blue eyes rested on him questioningly.  \"I'm an 'in-law' of the Club,\" he explained. \"My brother and sister, Tom and Della, are devoted members of the U. S. C. and sometimes they let me join them.\"  \"The doctor's bull-dog is an 'in-law,' too,\" laughed Mrs. Smith. \"Don't you remember him at Chautauqua?\"  \"The dog with the perfectly _extraordinary_ face? I do indeed remember him,\" and the inquiring blue eyes twinkled.  \"He appeared in an entertainment that the Club gave a few weeks ago for the Christmas Ship and I think he received more applause than any other performer.\"  \"I'm not surprised,\" exclaimed Miss Merriam. \"Thank you, Dr. Watkins, I shall be glad of your help,\" and Edward had a comfortable feeling that he was accepted as a friend, though he was not quite sure whether it was on his own merits or because he had a share in the ownership of a dog with an _extraordinary_ face.  He did not care which it was, however, when he called the next morning and found Miss Merriam waiting for him. She was well tailored and her handbag was all that it should be.  \"I hate messy girls with messy handbags,\" he thought to himself after a sweeping glance had assured him that there was nothing \"messy\" about this Mothercraft girl. The blue eyes were serious this morning, but they had a laugh in them, too, when he told her of the way the Belgian baby was first called for, upon a young girl's impulse, and the reward James Hancock had received for his cordial joining in the cry.  \"I'm going to like them all, every one of them,\" Miss Merriam said in the soft voice that was at the same time clear and firm.  \"I'm sure they'll like you,\" responded Edward.  \"I hope they will. I shall try to make them. But the baby will be a delight, any way.\"  At Rosemont, to Dr. Watkins's disappointment, they found Grandmother Emerson and the automobile waiting at the station. Edward bowed his farewell and went off upon his errand, and Mrs. Emerson and Miss Merriam drove to Mrs. Smith's where they found Elisabeth already installed in a sunny room out of which opened another for Miss Merriam. The arrangement had been made by Dorothy's moving into a smaller chamber over the front door.  \"I don't mind it a bit,\" she declared to her mother, \"and please don't say a word about it to Miss Merriam--she might feel badly.\"  So Gertrude Merriam accepted her room all unconsciously, and rejoiced in its brightness. The baby was lying before the window of her own room when Gertrude entered. It moved a listless hand as she knelt beside it.  \"You little darling creature!\" she exclaimed and Elisabeth gave her infrequent smile as if she knew that woman's love and science were going to work together for her.     CHAPTER IV  ELISABETH MAKES FRIENDS   Under Miss Merriam's skilful care Elisabeth of Belgium slowly climbed the hill of health. She had grown so weak that she required to be treated like a child much younger than she really was. Miss Merriam gave her extremely nourishing food in small amounts and often; she made her rest hours as long as those of a baby of a year and her naps were always taken in the open air, where she lay warmly curled up in soft rugs like a little Eskimo. At night she and her care-taker slept on an upper porch where she drew deep draughts of fresh air far down into the depths of her tiny relaxed body.  \"Ayleesabet\"--everybody adopted her own pronunciation--was napping in Dicky's old perambulator on the porch of Dorothy's cottage one Saturday morning early in December. The Ethels, their coat collars turned up and rugs wrapping their knees, were keeping guard beside her. Both of them were alternately knitting and warming their fingers.  \"When she wakes up we can roll her down the street a little way,\" said Ethel Blue.  \"Did Miss Merriam say so?\"  \"Yes, she said we might keep her out until twelve.\"  \"Are the Hancocks and Watkinses coming early to the Club meeting?\"  \"A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19834"],["title","Ethel Morton's Holidays (#6)"],["body","half past two. The afternoons are so short now that they thought they'd better come early so it wouldn't be pitch black night when they got home.\"  \"We ought to do some planning for Christmas this afternoon. There's a lot to think about.\"  \"There's one Christmas gift I wish Aunt Marian would give us.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Ethel Brown expectantly for she had great faith in the ideas that Ethel Blue brought forth now and then.  \"Don't you think it would be nice if she would let us have a visit from Katharine Jackson for one of our presents?\"  Katharine Jackson was the daughter of an army officer stationed at Fort Edward in Buffalo. Her father and Ethel Blue's father had been in the same class at West Point and her mother had known Ethel Blue's mother who had died when she was a tiny baby. The two Ethels had had a week-end with Katharine the previous summer, going to Buffalo from Chautauqua for the purpose of spending a glorious Saturday at Niagara Falls.  \"O-oh!\" cried Ethel Brown, \"that's one of the finest things you ever thought of! Let's speak to Mother as soon as we go home and write to Mrs. Jackson and Katharine this afternoon if she says 'yes'.\"  \"I'm almost sure she will say 'yes'.\"  \"So am I. If Katharine comes we can save all our Christmas festivities for the time she's here so there'll be plenty to entertain her.\"  \"Ayleesabet is waking. Hullo, sweet lamb,\" and both girls leaned over the carriage, happy because their nursling condescended to smile on them when she opened her eyes. Miss Merriam brought out a cup of warm food when it was reported to her that her charge had finished her nap, and when the luncheon was consumed with evidences of satisfaction the Ethels took the carriage out on to the sidewalk. Elisabeth sat up, still sleepy-eyed and rosy from her nap, and gazed about her seriously at the road that was already becoming familiar.  \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Ethel Blue under her breath, \"there are the Misses Clark coming out of their house.\"  \"I hope they aren't going to complain of Roger,\" Ethel Brown said, for Roger acted as furnace man for these elderly ladies who had gained for themselves a reputation of being ill-natured.  \"It's too late to cross the street. They look as if they were coming expressly to speak to us. See, they haven't got their hats on.\"  It did indeed look as if the little procession was being waylaid, for the Misses Clark stood inside their gate waiting for the Ethels to come up.  \"We saw you coming,\" they said when the carriage came near enough, \"and we came out to see the baby. This is the Belgian baby?\"  \"Yes; this is Ayleesabet.\"  \"Ayleesabet? Elisabeth, I suppose. Why do you call her that?\"  \"That's what she calls herself, and it seems to be the only word she remembers so we thought we'd let her hear it instead of giving her a new name.\"  \"Ayleesabet,\" repeated the elder Miss Clark, coming through the gate. \"Will you shake hands with me, Ayleesabet?\"  She held out her hand to the solemn child who sat staring at her with unmoved expression. Ethel Blue hesitatingly began to explain that the baby did not yet know how to shake hands, when to their amazement Elisabeth extended a tiny mittened paw and laid it in Miss Clark's hand.  \"The dear child!\" exclaimed both women, and the elder flushed warmly as if the delicate contact had touched an intimate chord. She gave the mitten a pressure and held it, Elisabeth making no objection.  \"Won't you bring her in to see us once in a while?\" begged the younger Miss Clark. \"We should like so much to have you. We've watched her go by with that charming looking young woman who takes care of her.\"  \"Miss Merriam. She's from the School of Mothercraft,\" and Ethel Brown explained the work of the school.  \"How fortunate you were to know about the school. It would have been anxious work for Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith if they had had full responsibility for such a feeble baby.\"  \"We all love Miss Merriam,\" said Ethel Blue. \"Say 'Gertrude,' Elisabeth,\" and Elisabeth obediently repeated \"Gertrude\" in her soft pipe, and looked about for the owner of the name.  \"We'll bring her in to call on you,\" promised the Ethels, saying \"Good-bye,\" and they went on feeling far more gently disposed toward their cross-patch neighbors than they ever had before. As for the \"cross-patches,\" they looked after the carriage as long as it was in sight.  When the girls returned to Dorothy's they found Edward Watkins there.  \"It's very nice of you to come out to see how the baby is getting along,\" said Ethel Brown, going in to the living room, while Ethel Blue helped Miss Merriam take Elisabeth out of the carriage.  \"I mean to keep an eye on her,\" replied Edward gravely.  \"You don't really have to do it if it isn't convenient, you know,\" returned Ethel. \"Of course we appreciate it tremendously, but Dr. Hancock is nearer and he's been coming over quite regularly.\"  \"I shan't try to compete with Dr. Hancock,\" promised Dr. Watkins; \"but Elisabeth is the Club baby, you know, and Tom and Della are members so as their brother I feel almost a personal interest.\"  \"It's lovely of you to feel so. I just didn't want you to be bothered,\" explained Ethel conscientiously.  When Miss Merriam brought the baby in he examined her carefully as one tiny hand after another was released from its mitten and one slender leg after the other emerged from the knitted trousers.  \"She isn't what you'd call really fat yet, is she?\" he commented.  \"She's a porpoise compared with what she was at the beginning,\" insisted Ethel Blue stoutly. \"Miss Merriam can tell you how many ounces she has gained.\"  \"She's gained in happiness, any way,\" smiled the young physician as the baby murmured \"Gertrude\" and patted Gertrude's flushing cheek.  There was a full meeting of the United Service Club when Helen called it to order at a quarter of three and informed the members that it was high time for them to discuss what they were going to do as a club for Christmas.  \"To tell the truth, I was awfully ashamed about our forgetting to do anything for anybody on Thanksgiving. It all came out right, because our 'show' for the Home went off well and the old ladies were pleased, but we didn't originate the idea and I feel as if we ought to make up for our forgetfulness by doing something extra at Christmas. Now who has any suggestions?\"  \"I'd like to know first,\" asked James, the treasurer, \"just how we stand with regard to Elisabeth. I know we can't afford to pay Miss Merriam's salary; I am afraid we've got to call on the grownups for that--but we can do something and we must, and we ought to find out about it exactly.\"  \"Mrs. Emerson is paying half Miss Merriam's salary,\" explained Dorothy.  \"And Aunt Louise the other half,\" added Ethel Brown.  \"I wrote to Father about Elisabeth,\" said Ethel Blue, \"and he said he'd send us a hundred dollars a year for her. We could put it in the bank for her, he said, if we didn't need to use it for doctors' bills or anything else.\"  \"Here's my pay from the Misses Clark; they forked over this morning,\" said Roger elegantly, as he in turn \"forked over\" a bill to James. \"Madam President, may the treasurer report, please?\"  \"The treasurer will kindly tell us what there is at the Club's disposal,\" directed Helen.  \"The treasurer is obliged to confess that there isn't very much,\" admitted James. \"The Christmas Ship just about cleaned us out, and the cost of some of the material for costumes for 'Miles Standish' nearly used up what was left. This greenback of Roger's is the best looking thing I've seen for some days.\"  \"I haven't paid my dues for December,\" confessed Ethel Blue. \"Here they are.\"  It proved that one or two of the others were also delinquent, but even after all had paid there was a very small sum in hand compared with what they needed.  \"There isn't any use getting gloomy over the situation,\" urged Helen. \"If we haven't got the money, we haven't, that's all, and we must do the best we can without it. Mother and Aunt Louise will wait to be paid. It isn't as if we had been extravagant and run into debt. The baby came unexpectedly and had to be made comfortable right off. We can assume that responsibility and pay up when we are able. I don't think that we ought to let that interrupt any plans we have to make Christmas pleasant for anybody.\"  \"I believe you're right,\" agreed Tom, \"but I think we must limit ourselves somewhat.\"  \"You'll be limited by the low state of the treasury, young man,\" growled James.  \"Wait and hear me. I imagine that what the president has in mind for our Christmas work is doing something for the children in the Glen Point orphanage.\"  Helen and Margaret nodded.  \"What do you say, then, if we decide to limit our Christmas work as a club to doing something for the orphanage and for Elisabeth? And I should like to suggest that no one of us gives a personal present that costs more than ten cents to any relative or friend. Then we can place in the club treasury whatever we had intended to spend more than that, and do the best we can with whatever amount that puts into James's hands for the Glen Point orphans and Elisabeth. Am I clear?\" and he sank back in his chair in seeming exhaustion.  \"You're very long-winded, Thomas,\" pronounced Roger, patting his friend on the shoulder, \"but we get your idea. I second the motion, Madam President. We'll give ten cent presents to our relatives and friends and put all the rest of our stupendous fortunes into giving the orphans a good time and getting some duds for Ayleesabet or paying for what she has already.\"  The motion was carried unanimously, and each one of them handed to James a calculation of how much he would be able to contribute to the Christmas fund.  \"It will come pretty near being ten cent presents for the orphans,\" James pronounced after some work with pencil and paper. \"We can't give them anything that the wildest imagination could call handsome.\"  \"There are plenty of people interested in the orphanage who"]]]
