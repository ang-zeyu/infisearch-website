I'd like to be going up to camp with them, and     I'd kind of like to be back in the office, too. I remember how I     used to be scared of you and you said you must be worse than the     Germans 'cause I wasn't afraid of them. I hope you're working     there yet and I'd like to see Mr. Burton, too.      \"I was going to write to Roy but I decided I'd send a letter to     you because whenever something is going to happen the fellows     write letters home and leave them to be mailed in case they don't     get back. So if you get this you'll know I'm killed. Most of them     write to girls or their mothers, and as long as I haven't got any     mother I thought I'd write to you. Because maybe you'd like to     hear I'm killed more than anybody. I mean maybe you'd be more     interested.      \"I'm going to go over the top with this regiment. I got sent way     over to this sector for special service. A fellow told me he     heard it was because I got a level head. I can't tell you where I     am, but this morning we're going to take a town. I didn't have to     go, 'cause I'm a non-com., but I volunteered. I don't know what     I'll have to do.      \"I ain't exactly scared, but it kind of makes me think about home     and all like that. I often wished I'd meet Roscoe Bent over here.     Maybe he wrote to you. I bet everybody likes him wherever he is     over here. It's funny how I got to thinking about you last night.     I'll--there goes the bugle, so I can't write any more. Anyway,     you won't get it unless I'm killed. Maybe you won't like my     writing, but every fellow writes to a girl the last thing. It     seems kind of lonely if you can't write to a girl.      \"Your friend,      \"TOM SLADE.\"     CHAPTER SIX  OVER THE TOP   The first haze of dawn was not dispelled when the artillery began to thunder and Tom knew that the big job was on. Stolid as he was and used to the roar of the great guns, he made hasty work of his breakfast for he was nervous and anxious to be on the move.  Most of the troops that were to go seemed to have gone already. He joined the two signal corps men, one of whom carried the wire and the other a telephone apparatus, and as they moved along the road other signal corps men picked up the wire behind them at intervals, carrying it along.  Tom was as proud of his machine as a general could be of his horse, and he wheeled it along beside him, keeping pace with the slow advance of his companions, his heart beating high.  \"If you have to come back with any message, you'll remember Headquarters, won't you?\" one asked him.  \"I always remember Headquarters,\" said Tom.  \"And don't get rattled.\"  \"I never get rattled.\"  \"Watch the roads carefully as we go, so you can get back all right. Noise don't bother you?\"  \"No, I'm used to artillery--I mean the noise,\" said Tom.  \"You probably won't have much to do unless in an emergency. If Fritzie cuts the wire or it should get tangled and we couldn't reach the airmen quick enough you'd have to beat it back. There's two roads out of Cantigny. Remember to take the south one. We're attacking on a mile front. If you took----\"  \"If I have to come back,\" said Tom, \"I'll come the same way. You needn't worry.\"  His advisor felt sufficiently squelched. And indeed, he had no cause to worry. The Powers that Be had sent Thatchy into the West where the battle line was changing every day and roads were being made and destroyed and given new directions; where the highway which took one to Headquarters one day led into the lair of the Hun on the next, and all the land was topsy-turvy and changing like the designs in a kaleidoscope--for the very good reason that Thatchy invariably reached his destination and could be depended upon to come back, through all the chaos, as a cat returns to her home. The prison camps in Germany were not without Allied dispatch-riders who had become \"rattled\" and had blundered into the enemy's arms, but Thatchy had a kind of uncanny extra sense, a bump of locality, if you will, and that is why they had sent him into this geographical tangle where maps became out of date as fast as they were made.  The sun was not yet up when they reached a wider road running crossways to the one out of the village and here many troops were waiting as far up and down the road as Tom could see. A narrow ditch led away from the opposite side of the road through the fields beyond, and looking up and down the road he could see that there were other ditches like it.  The tanks were already lumbering and waddling across the fields, for all the world like great clumsy mud turtles, with soldiers perched upon them as if they were having a straw ride. Before Tom and his companions entered the nearest ditch he could see crowds of soldiers disappearing into other ditches far up the road.  [Illustration: SHOWING WHERE THE AMERICANS WERE BILLETED: CANTIGNY, WHICH THEY CAPTURED AND THE ROUTE TAKEN BY TOM AND THE CARRIERS. ARROWS SHOW THE AREA OF ATTACK.]  The fields above them were covered with shell holes, a little cemetery flanked one side of the zigzag way, and the big dugouts of the reserves were everywhere in this backyard of the trench area. Out of narrow, crooked side avenues soldiers poured into the communication trench which the wire carriers were following, falling in ahead of them.  \"We'll get into the road after the boys go over and then you'll have more room for your machine. Close quarters, hey?\" Tom's nearest companion said.  When they reached the second-line trench the boys were leaving it, by hundreds as it seemed to Tom, and crowding through the crooked communication trenches. The wire carriers followed on, holding up the wire at intervals. Once when Tom peeped over the edge of the communication trench he saw the tanks waddling along to right and left, rearing up and bowing as they crossed the trench, like clumsy, trained hippopotamuses. And all the while the artillery was booming with continuous, deafening roar.  Tom did not see the first of the boys to go over the top for they were over by the time he reached the second-line trench, but as he passed along the fire trench toward the road he could see them crowding over, and when he reached the road the barbed wire entanglements lay flat in many places, the boys picking their way across the fallen meshes, the clumsy tanks waddling on ahead, across No Man's Land. As far as Tom could see along the line in either direction this shell-torn area was being crossed by hundreds of boys in khaki holding fixed bayonets, some going ahead of the tanks and some perching on them.  Above him the whole district seemed to be in pandemonium, men shouting and their voices drowned by the thunder of artillery.  His first real sight of the attack was when he clambered out of the trench where it crossed the road and faced the flattened meshes of barbed wire with its splintered supporting poles all tangled in it. Never was there such a wreck.  \"All right,\" he shouted down. \"It's as flat as a pancake--careful with the machine--lift the back wheel--that's right!\"  He could hardly hear his own voice for the noise, and the very earth seemed to shake under the heavy barrage fire which protected them. In one sweeping, hasty glance he saw scores of figures in khaki running like mad and disappearing into the enemy trenches beyond.  \"Do you mean to let the wire rest on this?\" he asked, as his machine was lifted up and the first of the wire carriers came scrambling up after it; \"it might get short-circuited.\"  \"We'll run it over the poles, only hurry,\" the men answered.  They were evidently the very last of the advancing force, and even as Tom looked across the shell-torn area of No Man's Land, he could see the men picking their way over the flattened entanglements and pouring into the enemy trenches. The tanks had already crossed these and were rearing and waddling along, irresistible yet ridiculous, like so many heroic mud turtles going forth to glory. Here and there Tom could see the gray-clad form of a German clambering out of the trenches and rushing pell-mell to the rear.  But it was no time to stand and look. Hurriedly they disentangled a couple of the supporting poles, laying them so that the telephone wire passed over them free of the barbed meshes and Tom, mounting his machine, started at top speed along the road across No Man's Land, dragging the wire after him. Scarcely had he started when he heard that wasplike whizzing close to him--once, twice, and then a sharp metallic sound as a bullet hit some part of his machine. He looked back to see if the wire carriers were following, but there was not a sign of any of them except his companion who carried the apparatus, and just as Tom looked this man twirled around like a top, staggered, and fell.  The last of the Americans were picking their way across the tangle of fallen wire before the German fire trench. He could see them now and again amid dense clouds of smoke as they scrambled over the enemy sandbags and disappeared.  On he sped at top speed, not daring to look around again. He could feel that the wire was dragging and he wondered where its supporters could be; but he opened his cut-out to get every last bit of power and sped on with the accumulating train of wire becoming a dead weight behind him.  Now, far ahead, he could see gray-coated figures scrambling frantically out of the first line trench, and he thought that the Americans must have carried the attack successfully that far, in any event. Again came that whizzing sound close to him, and still again a sharp metallic ring as another bullet struck his machine. For a moment he feared least a tire had been punctured, but when neither collapsed he took fresh courage and sped on.  The drag on the wire was lessening the speed of his machine now and jerking dangerously at intervals. But he thought of what one of those soldiers had said banteringly to another--_Stick around at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19495"],["title","Tom Slade, Motorcycle Dispatch Bearer (#5)"],["body","end of it and listen to what you hear_, and he was resolved that if limited horse power and unlimited will power could get this wire to those brave boys who were surging and battling in the trenches ahead of him, could drag it to them wherever they went, for the glorious message they intended to send back across it, it should be done.  There was not another soul visible on that road now nor in the shell-torn area of No Man's Land through which it ran. But the lone rider forged ahead, zig-zagging his course to escape the bullets of that unseen sharpshooter and because it seemed to free the dragging, catching wire, affording him little spurts of unobstructed speed.  Then suddenly the wire caught fast, and his machine stopped and strained like a restive horse, the power wheel racing furiously. Hurriedly he looked behind him where the sinuous wire lay along the road, far back--as far as he could see, across the trampled entanglements and trenches. Where were the others who were to help carry it over? Killed?  Alone in the open area of No Man's Land, Tom Slade paused for an instant to think. What should he do?  Suddenly there appeared out of a shell hole not twenty feet ahead of him a helmeted figure. It rose up grimly, uncannily, like a dragon out of the sea, and levelled a rifle straight at him. So that was the lair of the sharpshooter!  Tom was not afraid. He knew that he had been facing death and he was not afraid of what he had been facing. He knew that the sharpshooter had him at last. Neither he nor the wire were going to bear any message back.  \"Anyway, I'm glad I wrote that letter,\" he muttered.  [Illustration: TOM WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF UNINJURED, WHILE THE BOCHE COLLAPSED INTO HIS SHELL HOLE.]     CHAPTER SEVEN  A SHOT   Then, clear and crisp against the sound of the great guns far off, there was the sharp crack of a rifle and Tom was surprised to find himself still standing by his machine uninjured, while the Boche collapsed back into his shell hole like a jack-in-the-box.  He did not pause to think now. Leaving his machine, he rushed pell-mell back to the barbed wire entanglement where the line was caught, disengaged it and ran forward again to his wheel. Shells were bursting all about him, but as he mounted he could see two figures emerge, one after the other, from the American trench where it crossed the road, and take up the burden of wire. He could feel the relief as he mounted and rode forward and it lightened his heart as well as his load. What had happened to delay the carriers he did not know. Perhaps those who followed him now were new ones and his former companions lay dead or wounded within their own lines. What he thought of most of all was his extraordinary escape from the Boche sharpshooter and he wondered who and where his deliverer could be.  He avoided looking into the shell hole as he passed it and soon he reached the enemy entanglements which the tanks had flattened. Even the flat meshes had been cleared from the road and here several regulars waited to help him. They were covered with dirt and looked as if they had seen action.  \"Bully for you, kid!\" one of them said, slapping Tom on the shoulder.  \"You're all right, Towhead!\"  \"Lift the machine,\" said Tom; \"they always put broken glass in the roads. I thought maybe they'd punctured my tire out there.\"  \"They came near puncturing _you_, all right! What's your name?\"  \"Thatchy is mostly what I get called. My motorcycle is named _Uncle Sam_. Did you win yet?\"  For answer they laughed and slapped him on the shoulder and repeated, \"You're all right, kid!\"  \"Looks as if Snipy must have had his eye on you, huh?\" one of them observed.  \"Who's Snipy?\" Tom asked.  \"Oh, that's mostly what _he_ gets called,\" said someone, mimicking Tom's own phrase. \"His rifle's named _Tommy_. He's probably up in a tree somewheres out there.\"  \"He's a good shot,\" said Tom simply. \"I'd like to see him.\"  \"Nobody ever sees him--they _feel_ him,\" said another.  \"He must have been somewhere,\" said Tom.  \"Oh, he was _somewhere_ all right,\" several laughed.  A couple of the Signal Corps men jumped out of the trench near by and greeted Tom heartily, praising him as the others had done, all of which he took with his usual stolidness. Already, though of course he did not know it, he was becoming somewhat of a character.  \"You've got Paul Revere and Phil Sheridan beat a mile,\" one of the boys said.  \"I don't know much about Sheridan,\" said Tom, \"but I always liked Paul Revere.\"  He did not seem to understand why they laughed and clapped him on the shoulder and said, \"You'll do, kiddo.\"  But it was necessary to keep moving, for the other carriers were coming along. The little group passed up the road, Tom pushing his wheel and answering their questions briefly and soberly as he always did. Planks had been laid across the German trenches where they intersected the road and as they passed over them Tom looked down upon many a gruesome sight which evidenced the surprise by the Americans and their undoubted victory. Not a live German was to be seen, nor a dead American either, but here and there a fallen gray-coat lay sprawled in the crooked topsy-turvy ditch. He could see the Red Cross stretcher-bearers passing in and out of the communication trenches and already a number of boys in grimy khaki were engaged in repairing the trenches where the tanks had caved them in. In the second line trench lay several wounded Americans and Tom was surprised to see one of these propped up smoking a cigarette while the surgeons bandaged his head until it looked like a great white ball. Out of the huge bandage a white face grinned up as the little group passed across on the planks and seeing the men to be wire carriers, the wounded soldier called, \"Tell 'em we're here.\"  \"Ever hear of Paul Revere?\" one of the Signal men called back cheerily. And he rumpled Tom's hair to indicate whom he meant.  Thus it was that Thatchy acquired the new nickname by which he was to be known far and wide in the country back of the lines and in the billet villages where he was to sit, his trusty motorcycle close at hand, waiting for messages and standing no end of jollying. Some of the more resourceful wits in khaki even parodied the famous poem for his benefit, but he didn't care. He would have matched _Uncle Sam_ against Paul Revere's gallant steed any day, and they could jolly him and \"kid\" him as their mood prompted, but woe be to the person who touched his faithful machine save in his watchful presence. Even General Pershing would not have been permitted to do that.     CHAPTER EIGHT  IN THE WOODS   Beyond the enemy second line trench the road led straight into Cantigny and Tom could see the houses in the distance. Continuous firing was to be heard there and he supposed that the Germans, routed from their trenches, were making a stand in the village and in the high ground beyond it.  \"They'll be able to 'phone back, won't they?\" he asked anxiously.  \"They sure will,\" one of the men answered.  \"It ain't that I don't want to ride back,\" Tom explained, \"but a feller's waiting on the other end of this wire, 'cause I heard somebody tell him to, and I wouldn't want him to be disappointed.\"  \"He won't be disappointed.\"  The road, as well as the open country east and west of it, was strewn with German dead and wounded, among whom Tom saw one or two figures in khaki. The Red Cross was busy here, many stretchers being borne up toward the village where dressing stations were already being established. Then suddenly Tom beheld a sight which sent a thrill through him. Far along the road, in the first glare of the rising sun, flew the Stars and Stripes above a little cottage within the confines of the village.  \"Headquarters,\" one of his companions said, laconically.  \"Does it mean we've won?\" Tom asked.  \"Not exactly yet,\" the other answered, \"but as long as the flag's up they probably won't bother to take it down,\" and he looked at Tom in a queer way. \"There's cleaning up to do yet, kid,\" he added.  As they approached the village the hand-to-hand fighting was nearing its end, and the Germans were withdrawing into the woods beyond where they had many machine gun nests which it would be the final work of the Americans to smoke out. But Tom saw a little of that kind of warfare which is fought in streets, from house to house, and in shaded village greens. Singly and in little groups the Americans sought out, killing, capturing and pursuing the diminishing horde of Germans. Two of these, running frantically with apparently no definite purpose, surrendered to Tom's group and he thought they seemed actually relieved.  At last they reached the little cottage where the flag flew and were received by the weary, but elated, men in charge.  \"All over but the shouting,\" someone said; \"we're finishing up back there in the woods.\"  The telephone apparatus was fastened to a tree and Tom heard the words of the speaker as he tried to get into communication with the village which lay back across that shell-torn, trench-crossed area which they had traversed. At last he heard those thrilling words which carried much farther than the length of the sinuous wire:  \"Hello, this is Cantigny.\"  And he knew that whatever yet remained to be done, the first real offensive operation of the Americans was successful and he was proud to feel that he had played his little part in it.  He was given leave until three o'clock in the afternoon and, leaving _Uncle Sam_ at the little makeshift headquarters, he went about the town for a sight of the \"clean-up.\"  Farther back in the woods he could still hear the shooting where the Americans were searching out machine gun nests and the boom of artillery continued, but although an occasional shell fell in the town, the place was quiet and even peaceful by comparison with the bloody clamor of an hour before.  It seemed strange that he, Tom Slade, should be strolling about this quaint, war-scarred"]]]
