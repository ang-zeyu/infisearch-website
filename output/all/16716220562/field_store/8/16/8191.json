This _simulacrum_ rises out of the earth like an exhalation, and groups itself into shape above the spade with which all that is corporeal of its late owner has been interred. Please remark the uncomforted and dismal expression of the _simulacrum_. We must remember that the ghost or “Ka” is not the “soul,” which has other destinies in the future world, good or evil, but is only a shadowy resemblance, condemned, as in the Egyptian creed, to dwell in the tomb and hover near it.  The Chinese and Japanese have their own definite theory of the next world, and we must by no means confuse the eternal fortunes of the permanent, conscious, and responsible self, already inhabiting other worlds than ours, with the eccentric vagaries of the semi-material tomb-haunting larva, which so often develops a noisy and bear-fighting disposition quite unlike the character of its proprietor in life.                      [Picture: A Well and Water bogie]  The next bogie, so limp and washed-out as he seems, with his white, drooping, dripping arms and hands, reminds us of that horrid French species of apparition, “la lavandière de la nuit,” who washes dead men’s linen in the moonlit pools and rivers.  Whether this _simulacrum_ be meant for the spirit of the well (for everything has its spirit in Japan), or whether it be the ghost of some mortal drowned in the well, I cannot say with absolute certainty; but the opinion of the learned tends to the former conclusion.  Naturally a Japanese child, when sent in the dusk to draw water, will do so with fear and trembling, for this limp, floppy apparition might scare the boldest.  Another bogie, a terrible creation of fancy, I take to be a vampire, about which the curious can read in Dom Calmet, who will tell them how whole villages in Hungary have been depopulated by vampires; or he may study in Fauriel’s ‘Chansons de la Grèce Moderne’ the vampires of modern Hellas.  Another plan, and perhaps even more satisfactory to a timid or superstitious mind, is to read in a lonely house at midnight a story named ‘Carmilla,’ printed in Mr. Sheridan Le Fanu’s ‘In a Glass Darkly.’ That work will give you the peculiar sentiment of vampirism, will produce a gelid perspiration, and reduce the patient to a condition in which he will be afraid to look round the room.  If, while in this mood, some one tells him Mr. Augustus Hare’s story of Crooglin Grange, his education in the practice and theory of vampires will be complete, and he will be a very proper and well-qualified inmate of Earlswood Asylum.  The most awful Japanese vampire, caught red-handed in the act, a hideous, bestial incarnation of ghoulishness, we have carefully refrained from reproducing.                         [Picture: Raising the wind]  Scarcely more agreeable is the bogie, or witch, blowing from her mouth a malevolent exhalation, an embodiment of malignant and maleficent sorcery. The vapour which flies and curls from the mouth constitutes “a sending,” in the technical language of Icelandic wizards, and is capable (in Iceland, at all events) of assuming the form of some detestable supernatural animal, to destroy the life of a hated rival.  In the case of our last example it is very hard indeed to make head or tail of the spectre represented.  Chinks and crannies are his domain; through these he drops upon you.  He is a merry but not an attractive or genial ghost. Where there are such “visions about” it may be admitted that children, apt to believe in all such fancies, have a youth of variegated and intense misery, recurring with special vigour at bed-time.  But we look again at our first picture, and hope and trust that Japanese boys and girls are as happy as these jolly little creatures appear.

The great Napoleon lays his hand       Upon this eagle-headed N,    That marks for his a pamphlet banned       By all but scandal-loving men,—    A libel from some nameless den       Of Frankfort,—_Arnaud à la Sphère_,    Wherein one spilt, with venal pen,       Lies o’er the loves of Molière. {66}     Another shade—he does not see    “Boney,” the foeman of his race—    The great Sir Walter, this is he    With that grave homely Border face.    He claims his poem of the chase    That rang Benvoirlich’s valley through;    And _this_, that doth the lineage trace    And fortunes of the bold Buccleuch; {67a}     For these were his, and these he gave    To one who dwelt beside the Peel,    That murmurs with its tiny wave    To join the Tweed at Ashestiel.

Our names, like his, remembered not,    Like his, shall flutter on fly-leaves!     At least in pleasant company    We bookish ghosts, perchance, may flit;    A man may turn a page, and sigh,    Seeing one’s name, to think of it.

IN the whole amusing history of impostures, there is no more diverting chapter than that which deals with literary frauds.  None contains a more grotesque revelation of the smallness and the complexity of human nature, and none—not even the records of the Tichborne trial, nor of general elections—displays more pleasantly the depths of mortal credulity.  The literary forger is usually a clever man, and it is necessary for him to be at least on a level with the literary knowledge and critical science of his time.  But how low that level commonly appears to be!  Think of the success of Ireland, a boy of eighteen; think of Chatterton; think of Surtees of Mainsforth, who took in the great Sir Walter himself, the father of all them that are skilled in ballad lore.  How simple were the artifices of these ingenious impostors, their resources how scanty; how hand-to-mouth and improvised was their whole procedure!  Times have altered a little.  Jo Smith’s revelation and famed ‘Golden Bible’ only carried captive the polygamous _populus qui vult decipi_, reasoners a little lower than even the believers in Anglo-Israel.  The Moabite Ireland, who once gave Mr. Shapira the famous MS. of Deuteronomy, but did not delude M. Clermont-Ganneau, was doubtless a smart man; he was, however, a little too indolent, a little too easily satisfied.  He might have procured better and less recognisable materials than his old “synagogue rolls;” in short, he took rather too little trouble, and came to the wrong market.  A literary forgery ought first, perhaps, to appeal to the credulous, and only slowly should it come, with the prestige of having already won many believers, before the learned world.  The inscriber of the Phoenician inscriptions in Brazil (of all places) was a clever man.  His account of the voyage of Hiram to South America probably gained some credence in Brazil, while in England it only carried captive Mr. Day, author of ‘The Prehistoric Use of Iron and Steel.’  But the Brazilians, from lack of energy, have dropped the subject, and the Phoenician inscriptions of Brazil are less successful, after all, than the Moabite stone, about which one begins to entertain disagreeable doubts.  The motives of the literary forger are curiously mixed; but they may, perhaps, be analysed roughly into piety, greed, “push,” and love of fun. Many literary forgeries have been pious frauds, perpetrated in the interests of a church, a priesthood, or a dogma.  Then we have frauds of greed, as if, for example, a forger should offer his wares for a million of money to the British Museum; or when he tries to palm off his Samaritan Gospel on the “Bad Samaritan” of the Bodleian.  Next we come to playful frauds, or frauds in their origin playful, like (perhaps) the Shakespearian forgeries of Ireland, the _supercheries_ of Prosper Mérimée, the sham antique ballads (very spirited poems in their way) of Surtees, and many other examples.  Occasionally it has happened that forgeries, begun for the mere sake of exerting the imitative faculty, and of raising a laugh against the learned, have been persevered with in earnest.  The humorous deceits are, of course, the most pardonable, though it is difficult to forgive the young archæologist who took in his own father with false Greek inscriptions.  But this story may be a mere fable amongst archæologists, who are constantly accusing each other of all manner of crimes.  Then there are forgeries by “pushing” men, who hope to get a reading for poems which, if put forth as new, would be neglected.  There remain forgeries of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1961"],["title","Books and Bookmen (#8)"],["body"," the motives are so complex as to remain for ever obscure.  We may generally ascribe them to love of notoriety in the forger; such notoriety as Macpherson won by his dubious pinchbeck Ossian.  More difficult still to understand are the forgeries which real scholars have committed or connived at for the purpose of supporting some opinion which they held with earnestness.  There is a vein of madness and self-deceit in the character of the man who half-persuades himself that his own false facts are true.  The Payne Collier case is thus one of the most difficult in the world to explain, for it is equally hard to suppose that Mr. Payne Collier was taken in by the notes on the folio he gave the world, and to hold that he was himself guilty of forgery to support his own opinions.  The further we go back in the history of literary forgeries, the more (as is natural) do we find them to be of a pious or priestly character.  When the clergy alone can write, only the clergy can forge.  In such ages people are interested chiefly in prophecies and warnings, or, if they are careful about literature, it is only when literature contains some kind of title-deeds.  Thus Solon is said to have forged a line in the Homeric catalogue of the ships for the purpose of proving that Salamis belonged to Athens.  But the great antique forger, the “Ionian father of the rest,” is, doubtless, Onomacritus.  There exists, to be sure, an Egyptian inscription professing to be of the fourth, but probably of the twenty-sixth, dynasty.  The Germans hold the latter view; the French, from patriotic motives, maintain the opposite opinion.  But this forgery is scarcely “literary.”  I never can think of Onomacritus without a certain respect: he began the forging business so very early, and was (apart from this failing) such an imposing and magnificently respectable character.  The scene of the error and the detection of Onomacritus presents itself always to me in a kind of pictorial vision.  It is night, the clear, windless night of Athens; not of the Athens whose ruins remain, but of the ancient city that sank in ashes during the invasion of Xerxes.  The time is the time of Pisistratus the successful tyrant; the scene is the ancient temple, the stately house of Athenê, the fane where the sacred serpent was fed on cakes, and the primeval olive-tree grew beside the well of Posidon.  The darkness of the temple’s inmost shrine is lit by the ray of one earthen lamp.  You dimly discern the majestic form of a venerable man stooping above a coffer of cedar and ivory, carved with the exploits of the goddess, and with _boustrophedon_ inscriptions.  In his hair this archaic Athenian wears the badge of the golden grasshopper.  He is Onomacritus, the famous poet, and the trusted guardian of the ancient oracles of Musaeus and Bacis.  What is he doing?  Why, he takes from the fragrant cedar coffer certain thin stained sheets of lead, whereon are scratched the words of doom, the prophecies of the Greek Thomas the Rhymer.  From his bosom he draws another thin sheet of lead, also stained and corroded.  On this he scratches, in imitation of the old “Cadmeian letters,” a prophecy that “the Isles near Lemnos shall disappear under the sea.”  So busy is he in this task, that he does not hear the rustle of a chiton behind, and suddenly a man’s hand is on his shoulder!  Onomacritus turns in horror. Has the goddess punished him for tampering with the oracles?  No; it is Lasus, the son of Hermiones, a rival poet, who has caught the keeper of the oracles in the very act of a pious forgery.  (Herodotus, vii. 6.)  Pisistratus expelled the learned Onomacritus from Athens, but his conduct proved, in the long run, highly profitable to the reputations of Musaeus and Bacis.  Whenever one of their oracles was not fulfilled, people said, “Oh, _that_ is merely one of the interpolations of Onomacritus!” and the matter was passed over.  This Onomacritus is said to have been among the original editors of Homer under Pisistratus. {73}  He lived long, never repented, and, many years later, deceived Xerxes into attempting his disastrous expedition.  This he did by “keeping back the oracles unfavourable to the barbarians,” and putting forward any that seemed favourable.  The children of Pisistratus believed in him as spiritualists go on giving credit to exposed and exploded “mediums.”  Having once practised deceit, it is to be feared that Onomacritus acquired a liking for the art of literary forgery, which, as will be seen in the case of Ireland, grows on a man like dram-drinking.  Onomacritus is generally charged with the authorship of the poems which the ancients usually attributed to Orpheus, the companion of Jason.  Perhaps the most interesting of the poems of Orpheus to us would have been his ‘Inferno,’ or, Κατάβασις ὲς ᾄδου, in which the poet gave his own account of his descent to Hades in search of Eurydice.  But only a dubious reference to one adventure in the journey is quoted by Plutarch.  Whatever the exact truth about the Orphic poems may be (the reader may pursue the hard and fruitless quest in Lobeck’s ‘Aglaophamus’ {74}), it seems certain that the period between Pisistratus and Pericles, like the Alexandrian time, was a great age for literary forgeries.  But of all these frauds the greatest (according to the most “advanced” theory on the subject) is the “Forgery of the Iliad and Odyssey!”  The opinions of the scholars who hold that the Iliad and Odyssey, which we know and which Plato knew, are not the epics known to Herodotus, but later compositions, are not very clear nor consistent.  But it seems to be vaguely held that about the time of Pericles there arose a kind of Greek Macpherson.  This ingenious impostor worked on old epic materials, but added many new ideas of his own about the gods, converting the Iliad (the poem which we now possess) into a kind of mocking romance, a Greek Don Quixote.  He also forged a number of pseudo-archaic words, tenses, and expressions, and added the numerous references to iron, a metal practically unknown, it is asserted, to Greece before the sixth century.  If we are to believe, with Professor Paley, that the chief incidents of the Iliad and Odyssey were unknown to Sophocles, Æschylus, and the contemporary vase painters, we must also suppose that the Greek Macpherson invented most of the situations in the Odyssey and Iliad.  According to this theory the ‘cooker’ of the extant epics was far the greatest and most successful of all literary impostors, for he deceived the whole world, from Plato downwards, till he was exposed by Mr. Paley.  There are times when one is inclined to believe that Plato must have been the forger himself, as Bacon (according to the other hypothesis) was the author of Shakespeare’s plays.  Thus “Plato the wise, and large-browed Verulam,” would be “the first of those who” forge! Next to this prodigious imposture, no doubt, the false ‘Letters of Phalaris’ are the most important of classical forgeries.  And these illustrate, like most literary forgeries, the extreme worthlessness of literary taste as a criterion of the authenticity of writings.  For what man ever was more a man of taste than Sir William Temple, “the most accomplished writer of the age,” whom Mr. Boyle never thought of without calling to mind those happy lines of Lucretius,—               Quem tu, dea, tempore in omni     Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.  Well, the ornate and excellent Temple held that “the Epistles of Phalaris have more race, more spirit, more force of wit and genius, than any others he had ever seen, either ancient or modern.”  So much for what Bentley calls Temple’s “Nicety of Tast.”  The greatest of English scholars readily proved that Phalaris used (in the spirit of prophecy) an idiom which did not exist to write about matters in his time not invented, but “many centuries younger than he.”  So let the Nicety of Temple’s Tast and its absolute failure be a warning to us when we read (if read we must) German critics who deny Homer’s claim to this or that passage, and Plato’s right to half his accepted dialogues, on grounds of literary taste.  And farewell, as Herodotus would have said, to the Letters of Phalaris, of Socrates, of Plato; to the Lives of Pythagoras and of Homer, and to all the other uncounted literary forgeries of the classical world, from the Sibylline prophecies to the battle of the frogs and mice.  Early Christian frauds were, naturally, pious.  We have the apocryphal Gospels, and the works of Dionysius the Areopagite, which were not exposed till Erasmus’s time.  Perhaps the most important of pious forgeries (if forgery be exactly the right word in this case) was that of ‘The False Decretals.’  “Of a sudden,” says Milman, speaking of the pontificate of Nicholas I. (_ob._ 867 A.D.), “Of a sudden was promulgated, unannounced, without preparation, not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently over-awing at once all doubt, a new Code, which to the former authentic documents added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest Popes from Clement to Melchiades, and the donation of Constantine, and in the third part, among the decrees of the Popes and of the Councils from Sylvester to Gregory II., thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts of several unauthentic Councils.”  “The whole is composed,” Milman adds, “with an air of profound piety and reverence.” The False Decretals naturally assert the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome. “They are full and minute on Church Property” (they were sure to be that); in fact, they remind one of another forgery, pious and Aryan, ‘The Institutes of Vishnu.’  “Let him not levy any tax upon Brahmans,” says the Brahman forger of the Institutes, which “came from the mouths of Vishnu,” as he sat “clad in a yellow robe, imperturbable, decorated with all kinds of gems, while Lakshmi was stroking his feet with her soft palms.”  The Institutes took excellent care of Brahmans and cows, as the"]]]
