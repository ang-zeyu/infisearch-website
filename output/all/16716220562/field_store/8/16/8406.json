Bundle was a reign of peace and plenty, of loving-kindness and all good things. Moreover it was a reign of wholesomeness, both for body and mind. She did not give me cheese and beer from her own supper when she was in a good temper, nor pound my unfortunate head with her knuckles if I displeased her. She was strict in the maintenance of a certain old-fashioned nursery etiquette, which obliged me to put away my chair after meals, fold my clothes at bedtime, put away my toys when I had done with them, say \"please,\" \"thank you,\" grace before and after meals, prayers night and morning, a hymn in bed, and the Church Catechism on Sunday. She snubbed the maids who alluded in my presence to things I could not or should not understand, and she directed her own conversation to me, on matters suitable to my age, instead of talking over my childish head to her gossips. The stories of horror and crime, the fore-doomed babies, the murders, the mysterious whispered communications faded from my untroubled brain. Nurse Bundle's tales were of the young masters and misses she had known. Her worst domestic tragedy was about the boy who broke his leg over the chair he had failed to put away after breakfast. Her romances were the good old Nursery Legends of Dick Whittington, the Babes in the Wood, and so forth. My dreams became less like the columns of a provincial newspaper. I imagined myself another Marquis of Carabas, with Rubens in boots. I made a desert island in the garden, which only lacked the geography-book peculiarity of \"water all round\" it. I planted beans in the fond hope that they would tower to the skies and take me with them. I became--in fancy--Lord Mayor of London, and Mrs. Bundle shared my civic throne and dignities, and we gave Rubens six beefeaters and a barge to wait upon his pleasure.  Life, in short, was utterly changed for me. I grew strong, and stout, and well, and happy. And I loved Nurse Bundle.     CHAPTER III  THE DARK LADY--TROUBLE IMPENDING--BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN MAMMA   So two years passed away. Nurse Bundle was still with me. With her I \"did lessons\" after a fashion. I learned to read, I had many of the Psalms and a good deal of poetry--sacred and secular--by heart. In an old-fashioned, but slow and thorough manner, I acquired the first outlines of geography, arithmetic, etc., and what Mrs. Bundle taught me I repeated to Rubens. But I don't think he ever learned the \"capital towns of Europe,\" though we studied them together under the same oak tree.  We had a happy two years of it together under the Bundle dynasty, and then trouble came.  I was never fond of demonstrative affection from strangers. The ladies who lavish kisses and flattery upon one's youthful head after eating papa's good dinner--keeping a sharp protective eye on their own silk dresses, and perchance pricking one with a brooch or pushing a curl into one eye with a kid-gloved finger--I held in unfeigned abhorrence. But over and above my natural instinct against the unloving fondling of drawing-room visitors, I had a special and peculiar antipathy to Miss Eliza Burton.  At first, I think I rather admired her. Her rolling eyes, the black hair plastered low upon her forehead,--the colour high, but never changeable or delicate--the amplitude and rustle of her skirts, the impressiveness of her manner, her very positive matureness, were just what the crude taste of childhood is apt to be fascinated by. She was the sister of my father's man of business; and she and her brother were visiting at my home. She really looked well in the morning, \"toned down\" by a fresh, summer muslin, and all womanly anxiety to relieve my father of the trouble of making the tea for breakfast.  \"Dear Mr. Dacre, _do_ let me relieve you of that task,\" she cried, her ribbons fluttering over the sugar-basin. \"I never like to see a gentleman sacrificing himself for his guests at breakfast. You have enough to do at dinner, carving large joints, and jointing those terrible birds. At breakfast a gentleman should have no trouble but the cracking of his own egg and the reading of his own newspaper. Now do let me!\"  Miss Burton's long fingers were almost on the tea-caddy; but at that moment my father quietly opened it, and began to measure out the tea.  \"I never trouble my lady visitors with this,\" he said, quietly. \"I am only too well accustomed to it.\"  Child as I was, I felt well satisfied that my father would let no one fill my mother's place. For so it was, and all Miss Burton's efforts failed to put her, even for a moment, at the head of his table.  I do not quite know how or when it was that I began to realize that such was her effort. I remember once hearing a scrap of conversation between our most respectable and respectful butler and the housekeeper--\"behind the scenes\"--as the former worthy came from the breakfast-room.  \"And how's the new missis this morning, Mr. Smith?\" asked the housekeeper, with a bitterness not softened by the prospect of possible dethronement.  \"Another try for the tea-tray, ma'am,\" replied Smith, \"but it's no go.\"  \"A brazen, black-haired old maid!\" cried the housekeeper. \"To think of her taking the place of that sweet angel, Mrs. Dacre (and she barely two years in her grave), and pretending to act a mother's part by the poor boy and all. I've no patience!\"  On one excuse or another, the Burtons contrived to extend their visit; and the prospect of a marriage between my father and Miss Burton was now discussed too openly behind his back for me to fail to hear it. Then Nurse Bundle on this subject hardly exercised her usual discretion in withholding me from servants' gossip, and servants' gossip from me. Her own indignation was strongly aroused, and I had no difficulty in connecting her tearful embraces, and her allusions to my dead mother, with the misfortune we all believed to be impending.  [Illustration: The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, \"And how is Miss Eliza's little beau?\"]  At first I had admired Miss Burton's bouncing looks. Then my head had been turned to some extent by her flattery, and by the establishment of that most objectionable of domestic jokes, the parody of love affairs in connection with children. Miss Burton called me her little sweetheart, and sent me messages, and vowed that I was quite a little man of the world, and then was sure that I was a desperate flirt. The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, \"And how is Miss Eliza's little beau?\" And I laughed, and looked important, and talked rather louder, and escaped as often as I could from the nursery, and endeavoured to act up to the character assigned me with about as much grace as Ã†sop's donkey trying to dance. I must have become a perfect nuisance to any sensible person at this period, and indeed my father had an interview with Nurse Bundle on the subject.  \"Master Reginald seems to me to be more troublesome than he used to be, nurse,\" said my father.  \"Indeed you say true, sir,\" said Mrs. Bundle, only too glad to reply; \"but it's the drawing-room and not the nursery as does it. Miss Burton is always a begging for him to be allowed to stay up at nights and to lunch in the dining-room, and to come down of a morning, and to have a half-holiday in an afternoon; and, saving your better knowledge, sir, it's a bad thing to break into the regular ways of children. It ain't for their happiness, nor for any one else's.\"  \"You are perfectly right, perfectly right,\" said my father, \"and it shall not occur again. Ah! my poor boy,\" he added in an irrepressible outburst, \"you suffer for lack of a mother's care. I do what I can, but a man cannot supply a woman's place to a child.\"  Mrs. Bundle's feelings at this soliloquy may be imagined. \"You might have knocked me down with a feather, sir,\" she assured the butler (unlikely as it seemed!) in describing the scene afterwards. She found strength, however, to reply to my father's remark.  \"Indeed, sir, a mother's place never can be filled to a child by no one whatever. Least of all such a mother as he had in your dear lady. But he's a boy, sir, and not a girl, and in all reason a father is what he'll chiefly look to in a year or two. And for the meanwhile, sir, I ask you, could Master Reginald look better or behave better than he did afore the company come? It's only natural as smart ladies who knows nothing whatever of children, and how they should be brought up, and what's for their good, should think it a kindness to spoil them. Any one may see the lady has no notion of children, and would be the ruin of Master Reginald if she had much to do with him; but when the company's gone, sir, and he's left quiet with his papa, you'll find him as good as any young gentleman needs to be, if you'll excuse my freedom in speaking, sir.\"  Whatever my father thought of Mrs. Bundle's freedom of speech, he only said,  \"Master Reginald will be quite under your orders for the future, Nurse,\" and so dismissed her.  And Mrs. Bundle having \"said her say,\" withdrew to say it over again in confidence to the housekeeper.  As for me, if my vanity was stronger than my good taste for a while, the quickness of childish instinct soon convinced me that Miss Burton had no real affection for me. Then I was puzzled by her spasmodic attentions when my father was in the room, and her rough repulses when I \"bothered\" her at less appropriate moments. I got tired of her, too, of the sound of her voice, of her black hair and unchanging red cheeks. And from the day that I caught her beating Rubens for lying on the edge of her dress, I lived in terror of her. Those rolling black eyes had not a pleasant look when the lady was out of temper. And was she really to be the new mistress of the house? To take the place of my fair, gentle, beautiful mother? That wave of household gossip which for ever surges behind the master's back was always breaking over me now, in expressions of pity for the motherless child of \"the dear lady dead and gone.\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19859"],["title","A Flat Iron for a Farthing; or, Some Passages in the Life of an only Son (#3)"],["body","don't like black hair,\" I announced one day at luncheon; \"I like beautiful, shining, golden hair, like poor mamma's.\"  \"Don't talk nonsense, Reginald,\" said my father, angrily, and shortly afterwards I was dismissed to the nursery.  If I had only had my childish memory to trust to, I do not think that I could have kept so clear a remembrance of my mother as I had. But in my father's dressing-room there hung a water-colour sketch of his young wife, with me--her first baby--on her lap. It was a very happy portrait. The little one was nestled in her arms, and she herself was just looking up with a bright smile of happiness and pride. That look came full at the spectator, and perhaps it was because it was so very lifelike that I had (ever since I could remember) indulged a curious freak of childish sentiment by nodding to the picture and saying, \"Good-morning, mamma,\" whenever I came into the room. Such little superstitions become part of one's life, and I freely confess that I salute that portrait still! I remember, too, that as time went on I lost sight of the fact that it was I who lay on my mother's lap, and always regarded the two as Mamma and Sister Alice--that ever-baby sister whom I had once kissed, and no more. I generally saw them at least once a day, for it was my privilege to play in my father's dressing-room during part of his toilet, and we had a stereotyped joke between us in reference to his shaving, which always ended in my receiving a piece of the creamy lather on the tip of my nose.  But it was one evening when the shadow hanging over the household was deepest upon me, that I slipped unobserved out of the drawing-room where Miss Burton was \"performing\" on my mother's piano, and crept slowly and sadly upstairs. I went slowly, partly out of my heavy grief, and partly because I carried Rubens in my arms. Had not the lawyer kicked him because he lay upon the pedal? I was resolved that after such an insult he should not so much as have the trouble of walking upstairs. So I carried him, and as I went I condoled with him.  \"Did the nasty man kick him? My poor Ru, my darling, dear Ru! The pedal is yours, and not his, and the whole house is yours, and not his nor Miss Burton's; and oh, I wish they would go!\"  As I whined, Rubens whined; as I kissed him he licked me, and the result was unfavourable to balance, and I was obliged to sit down on a step. And as I sat I wept, and as I wept that overpowering mother-need came over me, which drives even the little ragamuffin of the gutter to carry his complaints to \"mother\" for comfort and redress. And I took up Rubens in my arms again, sobbing, and saying, \"I shall go to Mamma!\" and so weeping and in the darkness we crept into the dressing-room.  I could see nothing, but I knew well where \"Mamma\" was, and standing under the picture, I sobbed out my incoherent complaint.  \"Good-evening, Mamma! Good-evening, Sister Alice! Please, Mamma, it's me and Rubens.\" (Sobs on my part, and frantic attempts by Rubens to lick every inch of my face at once.) \"And please, Mamma, we're very miser-r-r-r-rable. And oh! please, Mamma, don't let papa marry Miss Burton. Please, please don't, dear, beautiful, golden Mamma! And oh! how we wish you could come back! Rubens and I.\"  My voice died away with a wail which was dismally echoed by Rubens. Then, suddenly, in the darkness came a sob that was purely human, and I was clasped in a woman's arms, and covered with tender kisses and soothing caresses. For one wild moment, in my excitement, and the boundless faith of childhood, I thought my mother had heard me, and come back.  But it was only Nurse Bundle. She had been putting away some clothes in my father's bedroom, and had been drawn to the dressing-room by hearing my voice.  I think this scene decided her to take some active steps. I feel convinced that in some way it was through her influence that a letter of invitation was despatched the following day to Aunt Maria.     CHAPTER IV  AUNT MARIA--THE ENEMY ROUTED--LONDON TOWN   Aunt Maria was my father's sister. She was married to a wealthy gentleman, and had a large family of children. It was from her that we originally got Nurse Bundle; and anecdotes of her and of my cousins, and wonderful accounts of London (where they lived), had long figured conspicuously in Mrs. Bundle's nursery chronicles.  Aunt Maria came, and Uncle Ascott came with her.  It is not altogether without a reason that I speak of them in this order. Aunt Maria was the active partner of their establishment. She was a clever, vigorous, well-educated, inartistic, kindly, managing woman. She was not exactly \"meddling,\" but when she thought it her duty to interfere in a matter, no delicacy of scruples, and no nervousness baulked the directness of her proceedings. When she was most sweeping or uncompromising, Uncle Ascott would say, \"My dear Maria!\" But it was generally from a spasm of nervous cowardice, and not from any deliberate wish to interrupt Aunt Maria's course of action. He trusted her entirely.  Aunt Maria was very shrewd, and that long interview with Nurse Bundle in her own room was hardly needed to acquaint her with the condition of domestic politics in our establishment. She \"took in\" the Burtons with one glance. The ladies \"fell out\" the following evening. The Burtons left Dacrefield the next morning, and at lunch Aunt Maria \"pulled them to pieces\" with as little remorse as a cook would pluck a partridge. I never saw Miss Eliza Burton again.  Aunt Maria did not fondle or spoil me. She might perhaps have shown more tenderness to her brother's only and motherless child; but, after Miss Burton, hers was a fault on the right side. She had a kindly interest in me, and she showed it by asking me to pay her a visit in London.  \"It will do the child good, Regie,\" she said to my father. \"He will be with other children, and all our London sights will be new to him. I will take every care of him, and you must come up and fetch him back. It will do you good too.\"  \"To be sure!\" chimed in Uncle Ascott, patting me good-naturedly on the head; \"Master Reginald will fancy himself in Fairy Land. There are the Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud's Waxwork Exhibition, and the Pantomime, and no one knows what besides! We shall make him quite at home! He and Helen are just the same age, I think, and Polly's a year or so younger, eh, mamma?\"  \"Nineteen months,\" said Aunt Maria, decisively; and she turned once more to my father, upon whom she was urging certain particulars.  It was with unfeigned joy that I heard my father say,  \"Well, thank you, Maria. I do think it will do him good. And I'll certainly come and look you and Robert up myself.\"  There was only one drawback to my pleasure, when the much anticipated time of my first visit to London came. Aunt Maria did not like dogs; Uncle Ascott too said that \"they were very rural and nice for the country, but that they didn't do in a town house. Besides which, Regie,\" he added, \"such a pretty dog as Rubens would be sure to be stolen. And you wouldn't like that.\"  \"I will take good care of Rubens, my boy,\" added my father; and with this promise I was obliged to content myself.  The excitement and pleasure of the various preparations for my visit were in themselves a treat. There had been some domestic discussion as to a suitable box for my clothes, and the matter was not quickly settled. There happened to be no box of exactly the convenient size in the house, and it was proposed to pack my things with Nurse Bundle's in one of the larger cases. This was a disappointment to my dignity; and I ventured to hint that I \"should like a trunk all to myself, like a grown-up gentleman,\" without, however, much hope that my wishes would be fulfilled. The surprise was all the pleasanter when, on the day before our departure, there arrived by the carrier's cart from our nearest town a small, daintily-finished trunk, with a lock and key to it, and my initials in brass nails upon the outside. It was a parting gift from my father.  \"I like young ladies and gentlemen to have things nice about 'em,\" Nurse Bundle observed, as we prepared to pack my trunk. \"Then they takes a pride in their things, and so it stands to reason they takes more care of 'em.\"  To this excellent sentiment I gave my heartiest assent, and proceeded to illustrate it by the fastidious care with which I selected and folded the clothes I wished to take. As I examined my socks for signs of wear and tear, and then folded them by the ingenious process of grasping the heels and turning them inside out, in imitation of Nurse Bundle, an idea struck me, based upon my late reading and approaching prospects of travel.  \"Nurse,\" said I, \"I think I should like to learn to darn socks, because, you know, I might want to know how, if I was cast away on a desert island.\"  \"If ever you find yourself on a desolate island, Master Reginald,\" said Nurse Bundle, \"just you write straight off to me, and I'll come and do them kind of things for you.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"only mind you bring Rubens, if I haven't got him.\"  For I had dim ideas that some Robinson Crusoe adventures might befall me before I returned home from this present expedition.  My father's place was about sixty miles from London. Mr. and Mrs. Ascott had come down in their own carriage, and were to return the same way.  I was to go with them, and Nurse Bundle also. She was to sit in the rumble of the carriage behind. Every particular of each new arrangement afforded me great amusement; and I could hardly control my impatience for the eventful day to arrive.  It came at last. There was very early breakfast for us all in the dining-room. No appetite, however, had I; and very cruel I thought Aunt Maria for insisting that I should swallow a certain amount of food, as a condition of being allowed to go at all. My enforced breakfast over, I went to look for Rubens. Ever since the day when it was first settled that I should go, the dear dog"]]]
