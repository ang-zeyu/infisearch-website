We're caught in it. Let's try to get a little off shore; we'll have one of those trees come tumbling down on our heads the first thing we know.\"  \"Not so easy,\" said Hervey, as they tried to backwater and at the same time get out from under the mountain.  \"Put her in reverse,\" said Roy, who never failed to get the funny squint on a situation.  But there was no use, the rushing water had them in its grip and they were borne along pell-mell, with trees and broken limbs which had fallen down the mountainside.  They were directly opposite the camp now, and cheerful lights could be seen in the pavilion where the whole camp community was congregated, safe from the storm. The noises which had seemed weird enough at camp were appalling now, as out of that havoc far above them, great bowlders came tumbling down into the lake with loud splashes.  Tom realized, all too late, the cause of the dreadful peril they were in. Out on the body of the lake and toward the camp shore the wind was blowing a gale from the mountains and, as it were, forcing the water back. But directly under the mountain there was no wind, and their position was as that of a person who is _under_ the curve of a waterfall. And here, because there was no wind to counteract it, the water was rushing toward what was left of the cove. It was like a rapid river flowing close to the shore and bearing upon its hurrying water the d√©bris which had crashed down from that lonesome, storm-torn height.  The boat was caught in this rushing water and the danger was increased by its closeness to the shore where every missile of rock or tree, cast by that frowning monster, might at any minute dash the craft to splinters.  The little flickering lights which shone through the spray and fine blown rain across that black water seemed very cheerful and inviting now.     CHAPTER IV  THE TREE   \"We're in a bad fix,\" said Tom; \"let's try to make a landing and see if we can scramble along shore to the cove.\"  It is doubtful whether they could have scrambled along that precipitous bank, but in any case, so great was the impetus of the rushing water that even making a landing was impossible. The boat was borne along with a force that all their exertions could not counteract, headlong for the cove.  \"What can we do?\" Roy asked.  \"The only thing that I know of,\" said Tom, \"is to get within reach of the shore in the cove. If we can do that we might get to safety even if we have to jump.\"  Presently the boat went careening into the cove; an appalling sound of scraping, then of tearing, was heard beneath it, it reared up forward, spilling its occupants into the whirling water and, settling sideways, remained stationary.  The boys found themselves clinging to the branches of a broken tree which was wedged crossways in the cove, its trunk entirely submerged. It formed a sort of makeshift dam and the boat, caught in its branches, added to the obstruction.  If it had not been for this tree the boat would have been borne upon the flood, with what tragic sequel who shall say?  \"All right,\" said Tom, \"we're lucky; keep hold of the branches, it's only a few feet to shore; careful how you step. If you let go it's all over. We could never swim in this torrent.\"  \"Where do you suppose this tree came from?\" Roy asked.  \"From the top of the mountain for all I know,\" Tom answered. \"Watch your step and follow me. We're in luck.\"  \"You don't call this luck, do you?\" Westy asked.  \"Watch me, I can go scout-pace on the trunk,\" said Hervey, handing himself along.  \"Never mind any of those stunts,\" said Tom; \"you watch what you're doing and follow me.\"  \"The pleasure is mine,\" said Hervey; \"a scout is always--whoa! There's where I nearly dipped the dip. Watch me swing over this branch. I bet you can't hang by your knees--like this.\"  There are some people who think that trees were made to bear fruit and to afford shade, and to supply timber. But that is a mistake; they were made for Hervey Willetts. They were the scenes of his gayest stunts. He had even been known to dive under the water and shimmy up a tree that was reflected there. He even claimed that he got a splinter in his hand, so doing! Upside down or wedged across a channel under water, trees were all the same to Hervey Willetts. He lived in trees. He knew nothing whatever about the different kinds of trees and he could not tell spruce from walnut. But he could hang by one leg from a rotten branch, the while playing a harmonica. He was for the boy scout movement, because he was for movement generally. As long as the scouts kept moving, he was with them. He had a lot of merit badges but he did not know how many. \"He should worry,\" as Roy said of him.  \"Here's a good one--known as the jazzy-jump,\" he exclaimed. \"Put your left foot....\"  \"You put your left foot on the trunk and don't let go the branches and follow me,\" said Tom, soberly. \"Do you think this is a picnic we're on?\"  \"After you, my dear Tomasso,\" said Hervey, blithely. \"I guess we're not going to be killed after all, hey?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" said Tom.  \"I wish I had an ice cream soda, I know that,\" said Roy.  \"Careful how you step ashore now,\" Tom said.  \"Terra cotta at last,\" said Roy; \"I mean terra firma.\"  \"Jump it,\" called Hervey, who was behind Roy.  Thus, emerging from a peril, which none but Tom had fully realized, they found themselves on the comparatively low shore of the cove. The tree, itself a victim of the storm, poked its branches up out of the black water like specters, which seemed the more grewsome as they swayed in the wind. These had guided the little party to shore.  So it was that that once stately denizen of the lofty forest had paused here to make a last stand against the storm which had uprooted it. So it was that this fallen monarch, friend of the scouts, had contrived to check somewhat the mad rush of water out of their beloved lake, and had guided four of them to safety.     CHAPTER V  WIN OR LOSE   The dying mission of that noble tree suggested a thought to Tom. The water from the lake was pouring over it, though checked somewhat by the tree and the boat. If this tree, firmly wedged in place, could be made the nucleus of a mass of wreckage, the flood might be effectually checked, temporarily, at least. One thing, a moment's glance at the condition of the cove showed all too certainly what must have happened at the road-crossing. That the little rustic bridge there could have withstood the first overwhelming rush of the flood was quite unthinkable. Berry's garage too, perched on the edge of the hollow, must have been swept away.  [Illustration: THE TREE POKED ITS BRANCHES UP OUT OF THE BLACK WATER AND GUIDED THEM TO SAFETY. Tom Slade's Double Dare. Page 25]  [Illustration: (Transcriber's note: Map including Black Lake, the rustic bridge, and Berry's Garage.)]  And where was the lumbering old bus? That was the question now. If it had been a motor bus its lights might have foretold the danger. But it was one of those old-fashioned horse-drawn stages which are still seen in mountain districts.  In all that tumult of storm, Tom Slade paused to think. All about them was Bedlam. Down the precipitous mountainside hard by, were crashing the torn and uprooted trophies of the storm high in those dizzy recesses above, where eagles, undisturbed by any human presence, made their homes upon the crags. The rending and crashing up there was conjured by the distance into a hundred weird and uncanny voices which now and again seemed like the wailing of human souls.  The rush of water, gathering force in the narrow confines of the cove, became a torrent and threw a white spray in the faces of the boys as it beat against the fallen tree. It seemed strange that they could be so close to this paroxysm of the elements, in the very center of it as one might say, and yet be safe. Nature was in a mad turmoil all about them, yet by a lucky chance they stood upon a little oasis of temporary refuge.  \"There are two things that have to be done--quick,\" said Tom. \"Somebody has got to pick his way down the west shore back to camp. It's through the mountains and maybe two of you had better go. Here, take my compass,\" he added, handing it to Westy. \"Have you got some matches?\"  \"I've got my flashlight,\" said Roy.  So it fell out that Westy and Roy were the ones to make the journey back to camp.  \"Keep as close to the shore as you can, it's easier going and shorter,\" Tom said. \"Anyway, use the compass and keep going straight south till you see the lights at camp, then turn east. You ought to be able to do it in an hour. Tell everybody to get busy and throw everything in the water that'll help plug up the passage. Chuck in the logs from the woodshed.\"  \"How about the remains of Pee-wee's signal tower?\"  \"Good, chuck that in. Throw in everything that can be spared. Most of it will drift over here and get caught in the rush. If the wind dies it will all come over. Hurry up! I'll stay here and try to get in place anything more that comes in in the meantime. There are a lot of broken limbs and things around here. Hurry up now, _beat it!_ And don't stop till you get there.... Don't let anybody try to start over in a boat,\" he called after them.  Scarcely had they set off when he turned to Hervey Willetts, placing both his hands on the boy's shoulders. The rain was streaming down from Hervey's streaked hair. The funny little rimless hat cut full of holes which he wore on the side of his head and which was the pride of his life had collapsed by reason of being utterly soaked, for he had very early discarded the oilskin \"roof\" in preference for this old love. One of his stockings was falling down and he hoisted this up as Tom spoke to him.  \"Hervey, I'm glad you're going alone, because you won't have to do any stunts for anybody's benefit. You're going to keep your mind on just one thing. Understand?\"  \"I can think of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19590"],["title","Tom Slade's Double Dare (#3)"],["body"," things at once,\" said Hervey, blithely, \"and sing _Over There_ and eat a banana at the same time. How's that?\"  \"That's fine. Now listen--just two seconds. You're to hit right straight up through this country--north. You notice I gave the compass to Roy? That's because I know you can't get rattled when you're alone and when you put your mind on a thing. You're to go straight north till you reach the road. I'll have to keep the lantern here, but you won't need it. You've got about a quarter of a mile of rough country and then easy going. Straight north beyond the road is Crows Nest Mountain. Turn around, that's right. Shut your eyes. One--two--three--four--five. Now open them suddenly. You see that black bulk. That's Crows Nest. Now you know how to see a dark thing in the dark....\"  \"Do you know how to tell time with a clothespin?\"  \"Never mind that. About every ten minutes stop and shut your eyes and old Crows Nest will guide you. Don't get rattled. When you get to the road wait for the bus and _stop it_. If it has passed by now, we can't help it. I'm afraid it has. But if it _hasn't_, there are two troops in it and their _lives depend on you_. Now get out of here--quick!\"  \"What was that?\" Hervey said, pausing and clutching Tom's arm.  \"What was what?\"  \"That sound--away off. Hear it?\"  Amid the wild clamor of the tempest, the dashing of the impeded water close by, and the ghostly voices up in that mountain wilderness, there sounded, far off, subdued and steady, a low melodious call, spent and thin from the distance, and blended with the myriad sounds of the raging storm.  \"_It's the train_,\" said Tom.  Still Hervey did not move, only clutched his companion's arm. One second--two seconds--three, four, five, six. The sound died away in the uproar of wind and rain.... Still the two paused for just a moment more, as if held by a spell.  \"A mile and a half--four miles,\" said Tom. \"Four miles of road. A mile and a half of hills and swamps. They're at the station now. You _can't_ do it, kid. But you'd better fail trying than not try at all. What do you say?\"  There was no answer, for Hervey Willetts had already plunged into the torrent, by which hazardous act ten minutes might be saved. Or everything lost. Tom caught a glimpse of that funny perforated hat bobbing in the rushing water of the cove, pulled tight down over its young owner's ears. Sober as his thoughts were in the face of harrowing peril, he could not repress a smile that Hervey should toss his life so blithely into the enterprise and yet be careful to save that precious hat. He was more proud of it than of all his deeds of reckless valor.  Tom knew there was no restraining him, or advising him. He knew no more of discipline than a skylark does. He was either the best scout in the world or no scout at all, as you choose to look at it. He was going upon this business in reckless haste, without forethought or caution. He would stake his life to save twenty yards of distance. There was no discretion in his valor. Blithe young gambler that he was, he would do the thing in his own way. No one could tell him. Tom knew the utter futility of shouting any last warnings or instructions to him.  For Hervey Willetts was like a shot out of a rifle. With him it was a case of hit or miss. He had no rules....     CHAPTER VI  SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT   One thing Hervey did bear in mind, and that was what Tom had told him about how to distinguish a dark object in the dark. He would not remember this twenty-four hours hence, but he remembered it then, and that is saying much for him. He tried to improve upon the formula by experimenting with his eyes cross-eyed, but it didn't work. Skirting the lower western reach of the mountain and beyond, in the comparatively flat country, he kept squinting away at old Crows Nest and its shadowy, black mass guided him. \"Slady's got the right dope on mountains,\" he said to himself.  The race was about as Tom had said; four miles for the horses, against a mile and a half for Hervey. Both routes were bad, Hervey's the worse of the two. All things considered, hills, muddy roads, trackless woodland, swampy areas, it should take the heavily loaded team a little over an hour to reach the bridge. By Tom's calculation it must take Hervey at least an hour and a half.  So there you are.  Going straight north, Hervey would have that dim black mass, hovering on the verge of invisibility, to guide him. Traveling a little west of north he might have reached the road at a nearer point. But here the traveling was bad and the danger of getting lost greater. Tom had weighed one thing against another and told Hervey to go straight north.  Hervey found the first half hour of his journey very difficult, picking his way around the base of the mountain. Beyond the country was flat and comparatively open, being mostly sparse woodland. The wind was very keen here, since there was no mountain to break its force and the rain blew in his face, almost blinding him.  Again and again he wiped his dripping face with his sleeve and plodded on, picking out his beacon now and again in the darkness. It was surprising how easy it was for him to do this by the little trick of which Tom had told him. His eyes would just catch the mountain for a second, then it would evaporate in the surrounding blackness, like breath on a pane of glass.  Suddenly, something happened which quite unnerved him. He was hurrying through a patch of woodland when, not more than ten feet ahead of him, he was certain that he saw something dark glide from one tree to another.  He stopped short, his heart in his mouth. The minutes, he knew, were precious, but he could not move. The wind in the trees moaned like some lost soul, and in his stark fear the beating of the drops on the leafy carpet startled him. He heard these because he was standing still, and the ceasing of his own footfalls emphasized the steady patter. Somewhere, in all that stormy solitude and desolation, an uncanny owl hooted its dismal song.  Hervey did not move.  It was not till he bethought him of those horses lumbering along the road ever nearer and nearer to that trap of death that he got control of himself and started off.  It was just the gloom of those dark woods, the play of some freakish and deceptive shadow conjuring itself into a human presence, that he had seen.... Who would be out in that lonely wood on such a night?  With a sudden, desperate impulse to challenge his fear and have done with it, he stepped briskly toward the tree to glance about it and dispel his illusion. If it was just some branch broken by the wind and hanging loose....  He approached the trunk and edged around it. As he did so a form moved around the trunk also. Hervey paused. The pounding of his heart seemed louder than the noises of the storm. In his throat was a queer burning sensation. He could not speak. He could not stir. The dark form moved again, ever so little....     CHAPTER VII  THE LIGHT THAT FAILED   The suspense was worse than any outcome could be, and Hervey, in another impulse of desperation, took a step to the right, then quickly another to the left. This ruse brought the two face to face. And in a flash Hervey realized that he had little to fear from one who had tried so desperately to escape his notice.  The figure was that of a young man, his raiment torn and disordered and utterly drenched. He wore a plaid cap, which being pulled down over his ears by reason of the wind, gave him an appearance of toughness which his first words belied.  \"You needn't be afraid,\" he said.  \"I'm not afraid,\" said Hervey. \"Who are you?\"  \"Did you hear some one scream?\" the stranger asked.  \"Scream? No. It was the wind, I guess. Are you lost, or what?\"  \"I want to get out of here, that's all,\" the young man said. \"This place is full of children screaming. Did you ever kill anybody?\"  \"No,\" said Hervey, somewhat agitated.  The stranger placed a trembling hand on Hervey's shoulder. \"Do you know a person can scream after he's dead?\" he said.  \"I don't know,\" said Hervey, somewhat alarmed and not knowing what to say. \"Anyway, I have to hurry; it's up to me to save some people's lives. There's a bridge washed away along the road.\"  He did not wait longer to talk with this singular stranger, but thoughts of the encounter lingered in his mind, particularly the young fellow's speech about dead people and children screaming. As he hurried on, Hervey concluded that the stranger was demented and had probably wandered away from some village in the neighborhood. He had reason later to recall this encounter, but he soon forgot it in the more urgent matter of reaching the road.  He had now about half a mile of level country to traverse, consisting of fields separated by stone walls. The land was soggy, and here and there in the lower places were areas of water. These he would not take the time to go around, but plunged through them, often going knee deep into the marshy bottom. It was sometimes with difficulty that he was able to extricate his leg from these soggy entanglements.  But he no longer needed the uncertain outline of that black mass amid the surrounding blackness to guide him, for now the cheerful lights of an isolated house upon the road shone in the distance. There was the road, sure enough, though he could not see it.  \"That's what Slady calls deduction,\" he panted, as he trudged on, running when he could, and dragging his heavy, mud-bedraggled feet out of the mire every dozen steps or so. Over a stone wall he went and scrambled to his feet and hastened on.  The lights in the house cheered and guided him and he made straight for this indubitable beacon. \"Mountains are all--all right,\" he panted, \"but kerosene lamps--for--for--mine. I hope that--bunch--doesn't go to--bed.\" His heart was pounding and he had a cruel stitch in his side from running, which pained him excruciatingly when he ran fast. He tried scout pace but it didn't work; he was not much of a"]]]
