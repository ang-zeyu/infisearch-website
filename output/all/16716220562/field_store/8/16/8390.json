After this he landed, beautifully dressed, and showed himself graciously to all who approached him.\"  The whole English fleet numbered about two hundred and thirty vessels, with stores for a year and money enough for longer still.  A southerly gale made nearly everybody sea-sick; for the Italian rowers in the galleys were little better as seamen than the soldiers were, being used to calm waters.  Some vessels were wrecked on the rocks of Cyprus, when their crews were robbed by the king there.  This roused the Lion-Hearted, who headed a landing party which soon brought King Comnenus to his senses.  Vinesauf wrote to say that when Comnenus sued for peace Richard was mounted on a splendid Spanish war-horse and dressed in a red silk tunic embroidered with gold.  Red seems to have been a favourite English war colour from very early times.  The red St. George's Cross on a white field was flown from the masthead by the commander-in-chief of the fleet, just as it is today.  On another flag always used aboard ship three British lions were displayed.  After putting Comnenus into silver chains and shutting him up in a castle Richard set two governors over Cyprus, which thus became the first Eastern possession of the British Crown.  Seven centuries later it again came into British hands, this time to stay.  Richard then sailed for the siege of Acre in Palestine.  But on the way he met a Turkish ship of such enormous size that she simply took Vinesauf's breath away.  No one thought that any ship so big had ever been built before, \"unless it might be Noah's Ark\", Richard had a hundred galleys. The Turkish ship was quite alone; but she was a tough nut to crack, for all that.  She was said to have had fifteen hundred men aboard, which might be true, as soldiers being rushed over for the defence of Acre were probably packed like herrings in a barrel.  As this was the first English sea fight in the Crusades, and the first in which a King of all England fought, the date should be set down: the 7th of June, 1191.  The Turk was a very stoutly built vessel, high out of the water and with three tall masts, each provided with a fighting top from which stones and jars of Greek fire could be hurled down on the galleys.  She also had \"two hundred most deadly serpents, prepared for killing Christians.\"  Altogether, she seems to have been about as devilish a craft as even Germans could invent.  As she showed no colours Richard hailed her, when she said she was a French ship bound for Acre.  But as no one on board could speak French he sent a galley to test her.  As soon as the Englishmen went near enough the Turks threw Greek fire on them.  Then Richard called out: \"Follow me and take her!  If she escapes you lose my love for ever.  If you take her, all that is in her will be yours.\"  But when the galleys swarmed round her she beat them off with deadly showers of arrows and Greek fire.  There was a pause, and the galleys seemed less anxious to close again.  Then Richard roared out: \"If this ship escapes every one of you men will be hanged!\" After this some men jumped overboard with tackle which they made fast to the Turkish rudder.  They and others then climbed up her sides, having made ropes fast with grapnels.  A furious slashing and stabbing followed on deck.  The Turks below swarmed up and drove the English overboard.  Nothing daunted, Richard prepared to ram her.  Forming up his best galleys in line-abreast he urged the rowers to their utmost speed.  With a terrific rending crash the deadly galley beaks bit home. The Turk was stove in so badly that she listed over and sank like a stone.  It is a pity that we do not know her name.  For she fought overwhelming numbers with a dauntless courage that nothing could surpass.  As she was the kind of ship then called a \"dromon\" she might be best remembered as \"the dauntless dromon.\"  King John, who followed Richard on the throne of England, should be known as John the Unjust.  He was hated in Normandy, which Philip Augustus of France took from him in 1204.  He was hated in England, where the English lords forced him to sign Magna Charta in 1215.  False to his word, he had no sooner signed it than he began plotting to get back the power he had so shamefully misused; and the working out of this plot brought on the first great sea fight with the French.  Looking out for a better king the lords chose Prince Louis of France, who landed in England next year and met them in London.  But John suddenly died.  His son, Henry III, was only nine.  So England was ruled by William Marshal, the great Earl of Pembroke, one of the ablest patriots who ever lived.  Once John was out of the way the English lords who had wrung from him the great charter of English liberties became very suspicious of Louis and the French.  A French army was besieging Lincoln in 1217, helped by the English followers of Louis, when the Earl Marshal, as Pembroke is called, caught this Anglo-French force between his own army and the garrison, who joined the attack, and utterly defeated it in a battle the people called the Fair of Lincoln. Louis, who had been besieging Dover, at once sent to France for another army.  But this brought on the battle of the South Foreland, which was the ruin of his hopes.  The French commander was Eustace the Monk, a Flemish hireling who had fought first for John and then for Louis.  He was good at changing sides, having changed from monk to pirate because it paid him better, and having since been always up for sale to whichever side would pay him best.  But he was bold and skilful; he had a strong fleet; and both he and his followers were very keen to help Louis, who had promised them the spoils of England if they won.  Luckily for England this danger brought forth her first great sea commander, Hubert de Burgh: let his name be long remembered.  Hubert had stood out against Louis as firmly as he had against John, and as firmly as he was again to face another bad king, when Henry III tried to follow John's example. Hubert had refused to let Louis into Dover Castle.  He had kept him out during the siege that followed.  And he was now holding this key to the English Channel with the same skill and courage as was shown by the famous Dover Patrol throughout the war against the Germans.  Hubert saw at once that the best way to defend England from invasion was to defeat the enemy at sea by sailing out to meet him.  This is as true today as ever.  The best possible way of defending yourself always is to destroy the enemy's means of destroying you; and, with us of the British Empire, the only sure way to begin is to smash the enemy's fleet or, if it hides in port, blockade it.  Hubert, of course, had trouble to persuade even the patriotic nobles that his own way was the right one; for, just as at the present day, most people knew nothing of the sea.  But the men of the Cinque Ports, the five great seaports on the south-east coast of England, did know whereof they spoke when they answered Hubert's call: \"If this tyrant Eustace lands he will lay the country waste.  Let us therefore meet him while he is at sea.\"  Hubert's English fleet of forty ships sailed from Dover on the 24th of August, 1217, and steered towards Calais; for the wind was south-south-east and Hubert wished to keep the weather gage.  For six hundred years to come, (that is, till, after Trafalgar, sails gave way to steam), the sea commanders who fought to win by bold attack always tried to keep the weather gage.  This means that they kept on the windward side of the enemy, which gave them a great advantage, as they could then choose their own time for attacking and the best weak spot to attack, while the enemy, having the wind ahead, could not move half so fast, except when running away.  Hubert de Burgh was the first commander who understood all about the weather gage and how to get it. Even the clever Eustace was taken in, for he said, \"I know these clever villains want to plunder Calais.  But the people there are ready for them.\"  So he held his course to the Forelands, meaning to round into the mouth of Thames and make for London.  Then Hubert bore down.  His fleet was the smaller; but as he had the weather gage he succeeded in smashing up the French rear before the rest could help it.  As each English vessel ranged alongside it threw grappling irons into the enemy, who were thus held fast.  The English archers hailed a storm of well aimed arrows on the French decks, which were densely crowded by the soldiers Eustace was taking over to conquer England.  Then the English boarded, blinding the nearest French with lime, cutting their rigging to make their vessels helpless, and defeating the crews with great slaughter.  Eustace, having lost the weather gage, with which he had started out that morning, could only bring his fleet into action bit by bit.  Hubert's whole fleet fought together and won a perfect victory.  More than a century later the unhappy Hundred Years War (1336-1431) broke out.  All the countries of Western Europe took a hand in it at one time or another.  Scotland, which was a sort of sub-kingdom under the King of England, sided with France because she wished to be independent of England, while the smaller countries on the eastern frontier of France sided with England because they were afraid of France.  But the two great opponents were always France and England. The Kings of England had come from Normandy and other parts of what is now France and what then were fiefs of the Crown of France, as Scotland was a fief of the Crown of England.  They therefore took as much interest in what they held in France as in their own out-and-out Kingdom of England.  Moreover, they not only wanted to keep what they had in France but to make it as independent of the French King as the Scotch King wanted to make "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19849"],["title","Flag and Fleet: How the British Navy Won the Freedom of the Seas (#7)"],["body","independent of them.  In the end the best thing happened; for it was best to have both kingdoms completed in the way laid out by Nature: France, a great land-power, with a race of soldiers, having all that is France now; and England, the great sea-power, with a race of sailors, becoming one of the countries that now make up the United Kingdom of the British Isles. But it took a hundred years to get the English out of France, and much longer still to bring all parts of the British Isles under a single king.  In the fourteenth century the population of France, including all the French possessions of the English Crown, was four times the population of England.  One would suppose that the French could easily have driven the English out of every part of France and have carried the war into England, as the Romans carried their war into Carthage.  But English sea-power made all the difference.  Sea-power not only kept Frenchmen out of England but it helped Englishmen to stay in France and win many a battle there as well.  Most of the time the English fleet held the command of the sea along the French as well as along the English coast. So the English armies enjoyed the immense advantage of sea-transport over land-transport, whenever men, arms, horses, stores, food, and whatever else their armies needed could be moved by water, while the French were moving their own supplies by land with more than ten times as much trouble and delay.  Another and most important point about the Hundred Years War is this: that it does not stand alone in history, but is only the first of the two very different kinds of Hundred Years War which France and England have fought out.  The first Hundred Years War was fought to decide the absolute possession of all the lands where Frenchmen lived; and France, most happily, came out victorious.  The second Hundred Years War (1689-1815) was fought to decide the command of the sea; and England won.  When we reach this second Hundred Years War, and more especially when we reach that part of it which was directed by the mighty Pitt, we shall understand it as the war which made the British Empire of today.  The first big battle of the first Hundred Years War was fought in 1340 between the French and English fleets at Sluys, a little seaport up a river in the western corner of what is Holland now.  King Philip of France had brought together all the ships he could, not only French ones but Flemish, with hired war galleys and their soldiers and slave oarsmen from Genoa and elsewhere.  But, instead of using this fleet to attack the English, and so clear the way for an invasion of England, he let it lie alongside the mudbanks of Sluys.  Edward III, the future victor of Cressy, Poitiers, and Winchelsea, did not take long to seize so good a chance.  The French fleet was placed as if on purpose to ensure its own defeat; for it lay at anchor in three divisions, each division with all the vessels lashed together, and the whole three in one line with a flank to the sea.  The English officers who had landed to look at it saw at once that if this flank was properly attacked it could be smashed in on the next bit of the line, and that on the next, and so on, before the remaining bits could come to the rescue.  On the turn of the tide Edward swooped down with his best ships, knocked this flank to pieces, and then went on till two divisions had been rolled up in complete confusion.  Then the ebb-tide set out to sea; and the Genoese of the third division mostly got away.  Ten years later (1350) the English for the first time fought a Spanish fleet and won a battle sometimes called Winchelsea and sometimes Espagnols-sur-mer or Spaniards-on-the-sea.  Edward III had sworn vengeance against the Basque traders from the coast of Spain who had plundered the English vessels coming in from France.  So he made ready to attack the Spanish Basques sailing home from Antwerp, where they had hired Flemings and others to join the fray.  This time each fleet was eager to attack the other; and a battle royal followed.  On the fine afternoon of the 28th of August King Edward sat on the deck of his flagship listening to Sir John Chandos, who was singing while the minstrels played.  Beside him stood his eldest son, the famous Black Prince, then twenty years of age, and his youngest son, John of Gaunt, then only ten.  Suddenly the lookout called down from the tops: \"Sire, I see one, two, three, four--I see so many, so help me God, I cannot count them.\"  Then the King called for his helmet and for wine, with which he and his knights drank to each others' health and to their joint success in the coming battle.  Queen Philippa and her ladies meanwhile went into Winchelsea Abbey to pray for victory, now and then stealing out to see how their fleet was getting on.  The Spaniards made a brave show.  Their fighting tops (like little bowl-shaped forts high up the masts) glinted with armed men.  Their soldiers stood in gleaming armour on the decks.  Long narrow flags gay with coloured crests fluttered in the breeze.  The English, too, made a brave show of flags and armoured men.  They had a few more vessels than the Spaniards, but of a rather smaller kind, so the two fleets were nearly even.  The King steered for the Spaniards; though not so as to meet them end-for-end but at an angle.  The two flagships met with a terrific crash; and the crowded main-top of the Spaniard, snapping from off the mast, went splash into the sea, carrying its little garrison down with all their warlike gear.  The charging ships rebounded for a moment, and then ground against each others' sides, wrecked each others' rigging, and began the fight with showers of arrows, battering stones from aloft, and wildfire flying to and fro.  The Spanish flagship was the bigger of the two, more stoutly built, and with more way on when they met; so she forged ahead a good deal damaged, while the King's ship wallowed after, leaking like a sieve.  The tremendous shock of the collision had opened every seam in her hull and she began to sink.  The King still wanted to follow the Spanish flagship; but his sailors, knowing this was now impossible, said: \"No, Sire, your Majesty can not catch her; but we can catch another.\"  With that they laid aboard the next one, which the king took just in time, for his own ship sank a moment after.  The Black Prince had the same good luck, just clearing the enemy's deck before his own ship sank.  Strange to say, the same thing happened to Robert of Namur, a Flemish friend of Edward's, whose vessel, grappled by a bigger enemy, was sinking under him as the two were drifting side by side, when Hanekin, an officer of Robert's, climbed into the Spanish vessel by some entangled rigging and cut the ropes which held the Spanish sails.  Down came the sails with a run, flopping about the Spaniards' heads; and before the confusion could be put right Robert was over the side with his men-at-arms, cutting down every Spaniard who struggled out of the mess.  The Basques and Spaniards fought most bravely.  But the chief reason why they were beaten hand-to-hand was because the English archers, trained to shooting from their boyhood up, had killed and wounded so many of them before the vessels closed.  The English won a great victory.  But it was by no means complete, partly because the Spanish fleet was too strong to be finished off, and partly because the English and their Flemish friends wanted to get home with their booty.  Time out of mind, and for at least three centuries to come, fleets were mostly made up of vessels only brought together for each battle or campaign; and even the King's vessels were expected to make what they could out of loot.  With the sea roads open to the English and mostly closed to the French and Scots the English armies did as well on land as the navy did at sea.  Four years before this first great battle with the Spaniards the English armies had won from the French at Cressy and from the Scots at Neville's Cross.  Six years after the Spanish fight they won from the French again at Poitiers.  But in 1374 Edward III, worn out by trying to hold his lands in France, had been forced to neglect his navy; while Jean de Vienne, founder of the regular French Navy, was building first-class men-of-war at Rouen, where, five hundred years later, a British base was formed to supply the British army during the Great War.  With Shakespeare's kingly hero, Henry V, the fortunes of the English armies in France revived.  In 1415 he won a great battle at Agincourt, a place, like Cressy, within a day's march of his ships in the Channel. Harfleur, at the mouth of the Seine, had been Henry's base for the Agincourt campaign.  So the French were very keen to get it back, while the English were equally keen to keep it.  Henry sent over a great fleet under the Duke of Bedford.  The French, though their fleet was the smaller of the two, attacked with the utmost gallantry, but were beaten back with great loss.  Their Genoese hirelings fought well at the beginning, but made off towards the end.  In 1417 Henry himself was back in France with his army.  But he knew what sea-power meant, and how foolish it was to land without making sure that the seaways were quite safe behind him.  So he first sent a fleet to make sure, and then he crossed his army, which now had a safe \"line of communication,\" through its base in France, with its great home base in England.  Henry V was not, of course, the only man in England who then understood sea-power.  For in 1416, exactly five hundred years before Jellicoe's victory of Jutland, Henry's Parliament passed a resolution in which you still can read these words: \"that the Navy is the chief support of the wealth, the business, and the whole prosperity of England.\"  Some years later Hungerford, one of Henry's admirals, wrote a _Book of English Policy_, \"exhorting all England to keep the sea\" and explaining what Edward III had meant "]]]
