Pardo paused, halfway up the low hill and drew Merriwell toward him.  \"That's Bosley, the crusherman,\" said he. \"He'll tell you where you can find Porter. Bring the prospector to my office, if you like. It isn't quite so noisy as the mill, and you can talk to better advantage.\"  The super turned and went back. Frank and his friends moved on to the ore platform, jumped to the top of it, and yelled their query at Bosley.  \"Nick?\" the crusherman bawled, leaning for a moment on his shovel, and appraising the boys as well as he could. \"Oh, he's communin' with himself in the feed loft. Right through that hole,\" he finished, pointing to an opening in the wall, \"and down the steps.\"  Frank led the way through the opening, and, at the foot of the steps, he and his chums found themselves in a small inferno. The bright, shimmering stems of twenty batteries, each of five stamps, were marking time before their eyes like, a row of steel soldiers. Each stamp weighed eight hundred and fifty pounds, and it rose and fell ninety-five times to the minute. The uproar was steady and deafening.  Ore feeders were shoveling crushed ore into the stamp hoppers. Frank's eyes ranged over the sweating, seminude, powerful figures as they worked. He could see nothing of Nick Porter.  While Frank's eyes were searching the loft, Clancy nudged him with an elbow. Frank turned, and Clancy made signs and pointed. Looking in the direction indicated by Clancy's finger, Frank saw the slouching form of Porter, the prospector.  He was sitting on a keg in an angle of the wall. He was leaning back against the boards behind him, a cob pipe between his teeth. His eyes, peering out of the jungle of beard that covered his face, were fixed speculatively on the three boys.  Merry immediately stepped to the prospector's side. \"Hello, Porter!\" he yelled in his ear.  The prospector probably grunted, although Frank could hear nothing.  \"I want to talk with you for a few minutes,\" Merry went on, in a manner calculated to disarm any suspicions Porter may have had. \"Come up to the super's office, will you?\"  He stepped back. The prospector sat still on the keg for a moment, then slowly knocked the ashes from his pipe and stood up. Frank was congratulating himself that Porter was to make for Pardo's office without any further persuasion; but in this he was mistaken.  Clancy stood on the prospector's right, Merry in front of him, and Ballard on the left--between the spot where, Porter was standing and the opening that led into the feed loft. The prospector slipped his pipe into his pocket, moving in a slow, sluggish way that suggested weariness.  He was not weary, however. Suddenly, without warning of any sort, he put out one arm and threw Clancy sideways, so that he fell over a heap of crushed stone. Another moment and Porter had leaped for a flight of stairs and had vanished downward into the body of the mill.  It was all so quickly done that Frank was taken by surprise. The thought flashed through his mind that Porter, unless he knew something about Professor Borrodaile and suspected why the boys were there, would not be showing his teeth in that fashion. An instant after the prospector had disappeared down the stairs, Frank jumped after him. Ballard followed close on Frank's heels; and Clancy, hastily picking himself up, stifled an exclamation of anger and rushed after Ballard.  The stairs led down to the floor where the boxes were placed, and where the plates, whose silver recovered the gold from the ore, stretched the length of the mill. Amalgamators and batterymen were going and coming through all the pounding racket of this part of the establishment, but the prospector had somehow managed to lose himself.  So suddenly and completely had Porter disappeared that it seemed little short of magical. Frank took three or four steps from the foot of the stairs, peering along the row of plates covered with dirty water from the battery boxes, and looking back into the shadowy recesses under the ore loft.  He was asking himself if Porter would have had time to get away into the darkness back of the batteries, when a red-shirted amalgamator stepped to his side.  \"Lookin' fer Porter?\" he yelled.  Frank nodded.  \"He ducked out o' the door yonder,\" and the amalgamator, with a jerk of his thumb, indicated an opening that led out into the night.  Ballard was nearest the door. He had heard the amalgamator, and whirled like lightning and dashed out of the mill and into the darkness.  Frank was tight at his heels, while Clancy brought up the rear of the little file of pursuers. The noise was not so deafening outside the mill, but the boys were blinded temporarily by their quick transition from the bright glow of the mill to the outer gloom. They stared around them, but could see nothing of the prospector.  Ballard, however, heard something or other which gave him a clew. \"This way!\" he shouted.  Frank heard his chum's feet swiftly crunching the sand and gravel, and followed the sound. In a moment or two his vision cleared somewhat and he was able to see several rows of huge wooden tanks. A plank incline led to the top of one row, and Ballard could be distinguished racing up the incline. Beyond Ballard, traveling at speed over a plank gangway that spanned the tanktops, was a burly figure silhouetted against the lighter gloom of the night. With a shout to Clancy, Merriwell hustled after Ballard.  Those tanks were part of the cyanide plant, wherein the refuse of the mill was treated with deadly cyanide of potassium for recovering what little gold was left after the refuse, or \"tailings,\" had come from the stamp mill.  The cyanide plant, presumably, was familiar ground to Porter, whereas the boys had never seen it before. In the gloom the prospector could navigate across the big vats with something like accuracy, while the boys carried on their pursuit at a tremendous disadvantage.  Recklessly Ballard ran on. Merriwell called a warning to him, but Ballard either did not hear it or else paid no attention.  The form of the prospector, leaping and plunging onward, sprang from one row of vats to another. Each row was a little lower than the row to the north, so that the tiers took on the form of a flight of giant steps.  Porter gained the top tier, and stood for a moment on a plank spanning a vat that was three or four times as large as any of the others. Ballard climbed to the same plank. Porter dropped down with a savage, snarling cry. Clinging for a moment to the edge of the tank, he twisted the plank from under Ballard's feet. Ballard dropped with a splash.  \"Merciful powers!\" yelled a voice in wild alarm. \"Get him out, quick! That's the solution tank and is filled with cyanide!\"  Merriwell's heart almost stopped beating. In a gleam of light from the mill he saw the white, drawn face of Pardo peering toward the spot where Ballard was splashing in the deadly cyanide solution. An instant later he bounded to the rescue.    CHAPTER IV.  A CLOSE CALL.  Just one thing saved Ballard from going over his head into the cyanide solution, and that was this: Porter had not twisted the plank off the rim of the tank, but had manipulated it in such a way as to cause Ballard to lose his footing and drop into the poisonous liquid beneath. As Ballard dropped, he flung out his arms, seized the plank, and so kept head and shoulders out of the cyanide. Had he gone under or swallowed even a few drops of the deadly stuff, that pursuit of the savage prospector would have had a tragic termination. Ballard, kicking around in the solution, was trying to drag himself up on the plank as Merry crept toward him.  \"Steady there, Pink!\" called Frank. \"Don't splash the stuff around, and keep out of it as much as you can. It's a deadly poison.\"  \"Never mind me,\" cried, Ballard. \"Keep after that confounded prospector He'll get away if you don't.\"  \"You first, old chap,\" Frank answered. \"It has a scurvy trick Porter played on you, and--and it might have resulted fatally. Now, then!\"  Gripping his chum by the arms, Frank heaved him upward until he was on his knees on the plank.  \"Want any help?\" came the agitated voice of Clancy, from just below the solution tank.  \"No,\" answered Merriwell, \"we're making it all right.\"  \"Drop him over the side,\" called Pardo, \"here, over in this direction. There's a tank of clear water next to the solution vat, and the quicker your friend rinses that cyanide out of his clothes, the better.\"  \"Oh, hang the cyanide!\" shouted Ballard. \"I was only half into the stuff, anyhow. Stop Porter, if you can. The brute is guilty of something or he wouldn't act like that.\"  \"Drop into that tank of water, Pink,\" ordered Merry, \"or I'll throw you in.\"  Ballard, without further discussion, lowered himself down into the reservoir of water that supplied the mill and kicked around in it for a few moments; then, drawing himself up on the rim of the vat, he jumped off to the ground at the superintendent's side. Merry and Clany quickly joined him.  \"Say,\" cried the startled Pardo, grabbing Ballard by the arm, \"did you swallow any of the solution?\"  \"How could I?\" was the answer. \"I only went in to the waist.\"  \"Got any cuts or sores on the lower part of your body?\"  \"No.\"  \"By gorry.\" declared Pardo, \"you're a lucky kid all right. Cyanide of potassium is the most virulent poison known. If a person scratches his finger on the tin in opening a case, and gets some of the solution in the cut, in less than fifteen minutes he's a goner. You don't know, son, how much you've got to be thankful for.\"  Now that it was all over, and Ballard was beginning to realize how deadly was the bath in which he had been plunged, a few cold shivers started up and down his spine.  \"My skin is getting up and walking all over me with cold feet,\" said he. \"I've got to warm up, and right now there's only one thing I want, and that is to get my hands in Porter's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19867"],["title","Frank Merriwell, Junior's, Golden Trail; Or, The Fugitive Professor (#4)"],["body"," and twist his neck. Let's hotfoot it around and see if we can find him.\"  \"This way, my lads,\" shouted Pardo. \"If the thing has happened that I've got in my mind, there's no use in hunting around this camp for the prospector. We'll find out in a brace of shakes.\"  With Pardo leading the way, the boys ran to a corral on the other side of the camp. Pardo stopped. The corral gate was swinging open.  \"That looks,\" he commented, \"as though some one had taken out a horse in a hurry. I'll just go in and see if Porter's horse is tied in its usual place. If it isn't, why, we can make up our minds that--\"  Just at that moment a man approached from the corral. The boys jumped forward instinct spelled by the thought that it might be Porter. But it was not.  \"That you, Cummins?\" called the super.  \"Yep, Pardo, it's Cummins,\" was the answer.  \"Seen anything of Nick Porter?\"  \"Jest about. Say, Nick Porter stormed in here a minute ago, got the gear on his bronk in record time, an' was off and away afore I could git close enough to find out what was up.\"  \"Which way did he go?\" demanded Frank. \"Toward town?\"  \"Nary. I rushed around the corral jest in time to see him p'intin' for Pete Loco's, which is right the other way from town.\"  \"He's made a get-away, boys,\" said Pardo, \"and you might as well give him up.\"  \"We're not going to give him up,\" Frank answered decidedly. \"We've got to keep after him, and run him down. It's--it's important.\"  \"Well, now,\" protested the super, \"you'd better think twice about that. Porter has shown that he won't stop at anything. He don't want to talk with you, does he? He's shown his teeth once; next time he does that he'll probably bite, and bite hard.\"  \"We'll look out for ourselves,\" put in the impatient Clancy. \"He's the fellow we want, Chip. Why did he turn on us as he did if he hasn't a guilty mind?\"  \"You think,\" spoke up Pardo, \"that he knows what has become of your friend, the professor? Mr. Bradlaugh told me, over the phone,\" he explained, \"why you wanted to talk with Porter.\"  \"It's a cinch, strikes me,\" answered Merry, \"that Porter can tell us something about the missing prof. Wouldn't you figure it out that way, Mr. Pardo?\"  \"Well, yes,\" acknowledged the superintendent. \"I don't know but I would. What I'm trying to get at is this: Old Nick Porter has proved that he isn't a safe proposition for you boys to tackle.\"  \"You don't know us, Mr. Pardo,\" laughed Clancy. \"That wasn't a fair shake the prospector gave us on top of those cyanide tanks. We ought to keep right after him. If we come close, we'll land on him by strategy.\"  \"That's the talk, Red!\" approved Ballard, through his chattering teeth. \"I'll furnish the strategy, if Chip should fall down on it. Let's get to moving. Three horses, Mr. Pardo, if you can spare 'em.\"  \"You haven't the slightest notion where Porter is going,\" said the super, plainly disapproving the plan of the boys to follow Porter, and marshaling every argument he could against it.  \"Where can he go along that trail toward Pete Loco's?\" returned Frank. \"There are only two places the trail leads to--one is Loco's and the other is McGurvin's. The trail stops at McGurvin's.\"  \"We haven't a horse for you. All that's left in the corral is the prospector's pack burro.\"  \"How about the two motor cycles?\" Frank asked. \"Mr. Bradlaugh said you had a couple of the machines here, and that we would be welcome to them if we found they'd come handy.\"  \"Well, yes,\" said Pardo, \"I've got the motor cycles. If you insist on going after the prospector, you can take them. But they'll only carry two--one of you will have to stay behind.\"  \"We'll draw straws, Red and I, to see who stays,\" chattered Ballard.  \"No, you won't,\" cut in Merry firmly. \"Pink, you've done enough for one night, and have thrown a scare into me that I won't get over in a hurry. You want to warm up, and the best way for you to do that is to sprint for town, kick off those cyanide-soaked clothes, and get into bed.\"  \"Now look here,\" Ballard protested, \"I'm just as able to go on with this chase as either you or Red. I've got an ax of my own to grind, too. Remember, Chip, I'm the one that Porter dropped into the solution tank. The prospector owes me something for that. Let Clancy go back to the hotel--\"  \"You're as wet as a drowned rat, Pink,\" struck in Clancy, \"and if you don't go back to town Chip and I will worry our heads off about you.\"  \"Oh, yes, you'll worry a lot,\" derided Ballard. \"The excitement is just beginning, and I'm entitled to a little of it.\"  \"There are only two motor cycles, Pink,\" argued Merry, \"so only two of us can go.\"  \"I'll ride the burro,\" suggested Ballard desperately.  \"And we'd go to the Picket Posts and back while you were getting to Loco's,\" laughed Clancy. \"You for town, Pink. Don't hang back. Maybe you'll dream some more.\"  \"You go to blazes,\" growled Ballard, seeing that the argument was already decided against him and that his protests were only delaying the pursuit.  \"Where are the machines, Mr. Pardo?\" asked Merry.  \"This way,\" the super answered, and led the boys to an adobe storehouse not far from the corral.  The motor cycles proved to be twin-cylinder, highpowered machines.  \"They're loaded with gasoline and oil,\" said Pardo, \"for we always keep them in trim for an emergency.\"  The gas lamps attached to the front of the motor cycles were lighted, and two penciled gleams searched out the ground far in advance.  \"Porter has a good, long start of us,\" remarked Clancy, an exultant note in his voice, \"but on these buzz buggies we ought to be able to travel a dozen yards to his one.\"  \"I don't know whether I ought to let you go,\" said Pardo. \"I'd go on one of the machines myself if the assistant superintendent wasn't away so that I am needed here. What will Mr. Bradlaugh say?\"  Merriwell laughed at the super's foolish fears.  \"Mr. Bradlaugh knows us better than you do, Mr. Pardo,\" he answered, \"and he'll say you did just right to let us have the machines and take up the chase where we dropped it at the cyanide tanks.\"  Merry, astride his wheel, was cranking with the pedals. The engine began to pop and sputter and was finally crooning its steady song of speed. Clancy had likewise turned his own engine over.  \"I wish you luck, anyhow,\" said Pardo.  \"We'll find that golden trail of yours, Pink,\" joked Clancy, \"and bring you one of the nuggets as a souvenir.\"  \"Just bring back your scalp, Red,\" answered Ballard. \"That's all the souvenir I want.\"  Frank dropped a foot and give his Machine a hunch forward. The pneumatic tires touched ground, the iron rests folded up automatically, and he started through the gloom toward the trail that led to Pete Loco's. A moment later Clancy darted after him.    CHAPTER V.  ON TO HAPPENCHANCE.  The boys were not long in discovering that the two motor cycles they were riding were fine machines. With the searchlights boring long holes in the dark, Merry and Clancy seemed fairly to fly over the trail. It seemed to them as though they had hardly started before the mass of deep shadow which marked the location of Loco's adobe lay almost in front of them on the right.  The house was dark. Frank, after getting out of the saddle, examined his watch under the lamp.  \"Ten o'clock,\" he announced to Clancy. \"The Loco family must all be in bed, Clan.\"  \"Rout some one out, Chip,\" said Clan, \"and see if you can pick up any news. While you're doing that I'll skirmish around and see if there is a recently ridden horse at Pete's hitching pole or in his corral.\"  Frank crossed the open space that lay between the road and the adobe and drummed on the front door with his knuckles. After two or three attempts he succeeded in arousing some one who demanded to know what was wanted.  \"I want a word with Pete Loco.\" Frank called.  The door was unbolted and drawn open, revealing a swarthy-visaged man in shirt and trousers, holding a candle.  \"What in blazes d'ye want?\" asked the man with the candle in no very pleasant tone. \"I'm Pete Loco.\"  \"Any visitors staying with you to-night, Mr. Loco,\" Frank inquired.  \"I reckon not! Think this here's a hotel?\"  \"I'm looking for a prospector named Porter. The last we saw of him he was coming in this direction.\"  \"Nick Porter? He's over to the mine. Seen him there this afternoon.\"  \"He's not there now. He left the mine and came this way.\"  \"Well, I haven't seen him, an' he ain't here.\"  With that Pete Loco shut the door, and Frank could hear him shoot the bolt. Turning away, Frank met Clancy just coming around the corner of the house.  \"Loco says he doesn't know anything about our man, Clancy,\" reported Frank.  \"I guess he's telling the truth, Chip,\" Clancy replied. \"I can't find any extra live stock around, and it's hardly possible, anyhow, that Porter would stop such a short distance from the mine. It's a safe bet that he's gone on to McGurvin's.\"  Frank was in a quandary.  \"This adobe,\" said he, \"is at the forks of the trail. One branch goes to the mine and Ophir, and the other leads to Gold Hill. It's just possible that Porter took the Gold Hill fork and didn't go on to McGurvin's.\"  \"He wouldn't do that, Chip.\" Clancy answered. \"If he had wanted to go to Gold Hill he would have turned north from the mine and taken the shorter road through Ophir.\"  \"Unless,\" Frank qualified, \"he had reasons for not wanting to pass through Ophir. Porter might have thought that we would use the telephone if he went that way, and have some one stop him.\"  \"Tell you what we can do,\" Clancy suggested, taken somewhat with Merry's logic and yet not quite satisfied to recede from his own position, \"we can go on to McGurvin's; then, if we don't overhaul Porter on the road, or pick up any clews at McGurvin's, we can come back and take the Gold Hill fork from here. We can get over the ground like an express train with these machines, and can ride circles all around that horse that carried the prospector away from the mine.\"  \"Good!\" agreed Frank. \"We'll see"]]]
