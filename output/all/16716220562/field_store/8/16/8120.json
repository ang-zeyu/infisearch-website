It will also be of great value to those who are undergoing training.  It is full of practical information presented in a simple and direct manner and gives in detail much data not easily found elsewhere. It is a useful book, easily understandable by those who have had little or no military experience.  It will be useful not only at training camps but it will be of very great value at schools and colleges where military instruction is being given.  The authors of this book have performed a valuable service, one which will tend to facilitate and aid very much the development of military training in this country. In addition to the purely mechanical details of training the book presents in a very effective and simple manner the tactical use of troops under various conditions.  In a word it is a useful and sound work and one which can be commended to those who contemplate a course in military training.  (Signed) Leonard Wood, Major General U. S. A.  February 27, 1917.     PREFACE   This book is intended to serve as a foundation upon which the military beginner may build so that he may in time be able to study the technical service manuals intelligently. It has been written as an elementary textbook for those who desire to become Reserve Officers, for schools and colleges, and for those who may be called to the colors.  The authors have commanded companies at Plattsburg, New York, and, noting the need of such a text, compiled their observations while there.  The average man undergoing military training wants to know as much as possible about the art and science of war. He wants to acquire a good knowledge of the principles involved. He is interested in the technique of movements. He is willing to work for these things, but he often becomes lost in confusion when he attempts to study the technical service manuals. He does not know how to select the most important and omit the less important. The authors have selected from the standard texts some of the vitally important subjects and principles and have presented them to the civilian in a simple and plain way.  The first part of the text is for the beginner. It tells him how to prepare physically for strenuous military work. After assisting him through the elementary part of his instruction, it presents for his consideration and study the Officers' Reserve Corps.  The second part, or supplement, is a more technical discussion of those subjects introduced in the first. It is intended principally for those who have made excellent progress.

The departments and their headquarters are as follows:       (1) The Northeastern Department, with headquarters at Boston,          Massachusetts.       (2) The Eastern Department, with headquarters at Governors Island,          New York.       (3) The Southeastern Department, with Headquarters at Charleston,          South Carolina.       (4) The Central Department, with Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois.       (5) The Southern Department, with Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston,          Texas.       (6) The Western Department, with Headquarters at San Francisco,          California.       Overseas    { (7) The Philippine Department, with Headquarters at      Departments {     Manila.                  {                  { (8) The Hawaiian Department, Departments with                  {     Headquarters at Honolulu, Hawaii.  (For States comprising each department, see Appendix)  If you are a civilian and desire any information in regard to the army, any training camps, the officers' reserve corps, or any military legislation or orders affecting you, write to the \"Commanding General\" of the Department in which you live. Address your letter to him at his headquarters.    MAIL   Mail is most often delayed because there is not sufficient information for the Postmaster on the envelope. The delivery of your mail will be delayed unless your letters are sent to the company and the regiment to which you belong. Therefore, prepare, before you reach camp, several stamped postal cards, addressed to your family and business associates, containing directions to address all communications to you care of Company----, Regiment----. As soon as you are assigned to a company and regiment, fill in these data and mail these postal cards at once. This should be done by wire in case important mail is expected during the first week of camp. Mail is delivered to each company as soon as a complete roll of the organizations can be made out and sent to the post-office.    INOCULATIONS AND VACCINATION   As soon as you become a member of the army, whether as a private or as an officer, you will receive the typhoid prophylaxis inoculation and be vaccinated against smallpox.    WHAT TO BRING       1. Travel light. Bring only the bare necessities of life with you.     Don't bring a trunk. Enlisted men (not officers) will be supplied     with all necessary uniforms and underwear. This includes shoes.      2. Bring a pair of sneakers, or slippers. They will add greatly to     your comfort after a long march or hard day's work. A complete     bathing suit often comes in handy.      3. Report in uniform if you have one.      4. The Government will provide you with the necessary shoes.     However, if you can afford it, buy before you report for duty, a     pair of regulation tan shoes, larger than you ordinarily wear, and     break them in well before arrival. Rubber heels are recommended.      5. Bring your toilet articles (comb, brush, mirror shaving     equipment, etc.), and a good supply of handkerchiefs, and towels.    WHAT TO DO ON YOUR ARRIVAL   There is a general rule of procedure to follow in reporting for duty at any post or training camp.      1. If you receive an order directing you to report for duty at a     camp or post at a certain specified time, read it carefully, put it     in a secure place, and, on the day that you are to report for duty     at the camp or post, present yourself in uniform, if you have one,     with your order. Be careful not to lose your order or leave it at     home. Have it in your pocket book.      2. Upon being assigned to a company, unless you receive orders to     the contrary, report at once with your baggage to your company     commander (captain), whom you can easily find when you reach your     barracks or company street. If you cannot locate your company     commander, report to the first sergeant.      3. It is a custom of the service to have an experienced soldier     explain to a new man exactly where he is to go and what he is to do.     Feel no embarrassment at being ignorant of your new duties and     surroundings. The Government does not expect anything of you except     eagerness to learn and willingness to obey.      4. After reporting to your company commander or first sergeant, you     will have a bed assigned to you and you will be issued the property     and uniforms necessary to your comfort and duties. Check your     property carefully as it is issued to you. You will have to sign for     all of it. Look after your property at all times.      5. After checking your property, make up your bed and arrange neatly     your personal and issued property on or under your bed or cot.      6. Spend all your spare time cleaning your rifle and bayonet until     they satisfy your company commander. Then keep them clean.      7. Don't leave the company street or barracks on the first day,     except with the permission of your company commander. Don't ask for     this permission unless you have a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],["title","The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#1)"],["body","reason.    RULES OF CONDUCT FOR CAMP LIFE   The first few days will be easy and profitable if you will read carefully and adhere to the following plan of procedure:      1. Get up at the first note of reveille and get quickly into proper     uniform.      2. Get within two or three feet of your place in ranks and await the     sounding of assembly for reveille and then step into ranks.      3. Stand at attention after the first sergeant commands \"Fall In.\"     Remember that this command is equivalent to \"Company, Attention.\"      4. After reveille, make up your bed, arrange neatly your equipment,     and clean up the ground under and around your cot. The company     commander will require the beds made up and the equipment arranged     in a prescribed way.      5. Wash for breakfast.      6. Upon returning from breakfast, go at once to the toilet. Next,     prepare the equipment prescribed to be worn to drill. This is     especially important when the full pack is prescribed. Assist your     tent mates in policing the ground in and around your tent.      7. If you need medical attention give your name to the first     sergeant at reveille and report to him at his tent upon your return     from breakfast. Don't wait until you are sick to report to the     hospital, but go as soon as you feel in the least unwell.      8. When the first call for drill is blown, put on your equipment,     inspect your bed and property to see that everything is in order,     and then go to your place in ranks.      9. After the morning drill, get ready for dinner. Get a little rest     at this time if possible.      10. After dinner a short rest is usually allowed before the     afternoon drill. Take advantage of this opportunity; get off your     feet and rest. Be quiet so that your tent mates may rest.      11. Following the afternoon drill there is a short intermission     before the ceremony of retreat. During this time take a quick bath,     shave, get into the proper uniform for retreat, shine your shoes and     brush your clothes and hat. Be the neatest man in the company.      12. Supper usually follows retreat.      13. After supper, you usually have some spare time until taps. The     Y. M. C. A. generally provides a place supplied with Bibles,     newspapers, good magazines, and writing material. Don't be ashamed     to read the Bible. Don't forget to write to the folks back home.      14. Be in bed with lights out at taps. After taps and before     reveille, remain silent, thus showing consideration for those who     are sleeping or trying to sleep.      15. Consult the company bulletin board at least twice daily. On this     bulletin board is usually found the following information:          (a) A list of calls.         (b) The proper uniform for each formation.         (c) Schedule of drills.         (d) Special orders and instructions.      16. Get all your orders from (a) the bulletin board, (b) the first     sergeant, (c) the acting noncommissioned officers, (d) the company     commander. Don't put much faith in rumors.    ADVICE REGARDING HABITS   Your life in camp in regard to food, exercise, hours of sleep, surroundings, and comforts, will differ greatly from that you lead as a civilian. You will submit your body to a sudden, severe, physical test. In order to prepare your body for this change in manner of living and work, we recommend that for a short time prior to your arrival in camp, and thereafter, you observe the following suggestions:       1. Use no alcohol of any kind.       2. Stop smoking, or at least be temperate in the use of tobacco.       3. Eat and drink moderately. Chew your food well. It is advisable,      however, to drink a great deal of cool (not cold) water between      meals.       4. Don't eat between meals.       5. Accustom yourself to regular hours as to sleeping, eating, and      the morning functions.       6. Keep away from all soda fountains and soft drink stands.       7. For at least two weeks prior to your arrival at camp, take      regularly the exercises described in this book.  Most men are troubled with their feet during the first week of each camp, usually because they do not observe the following precautions:       1. If you have ever had trouble with the arches of your feet, wear         braces for them.       2. Lace your shoe as tightly as comfort will permit.       3. Wash the feet daily.       4. Every morning shake a little talcum powder or \"Foot Ease\" in         each shoe.       5. Each morning put on a fresh pair of socks. Your socks should fit         the feet so neatly that no wrinkles remain in them and yet not be         so tight that they bind the foot. Do not wear a sock with a hole in         it or one that has been darned.       6. Some men cannot wear light wool socks with comfort. Do not wear         silk or cotton socks until you have given light wool socks a fair         trial.       7. In case of a blister, treat it as directed in Chapter X.       8. Most of the foot troubles are caused by wearing shoes that do         not fit properly. If the shoe is too large it rubs blisters, if too         small it cramps the foot and causes severe pain. Marching several         hours while carrying about thirty pounds of equipment causes each         foot to expand at least one half a size in length and         correspondingly in breadth; hence the size of the shoe you wear in         the office will be too small for training camp use. If you have         been living a sedentary life, ask for a pair of shoes larger than         you ordinarily wear.       9. In case the tendon in your heel becomes tender, report at once         to the hospital tent and get it strapped.    A DISCIPLINED SOLDIER   You will be expected to become quickly amenable both mentally and physically to discipline. A clear conception on your part of what drills are disciplinary in character and what discipline really is, will help you to become a disciplined soldier. Drills executed at attention are disciplinary exercises and are designed to teach precise and soldierly movements and to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience which is essential to proper military control. Hence, all corrections should be given and received in an impersonal manner. Never forget that you lose your identity as an individual when you step into ranks; you then become merely a unit of a mass. As soon as you obey properly, promptly, and, at times, unconsciously, the commands of your officers, as soon as you can cheerfully give up pleasures and personal privileges that conflict with the new order of life to which you have submitted, you will then have become a disciplined man.    DRESS   The uniform you will wear stands for Duty, Honor, and Country. You should not disgrace it by the way you wear it or by your conduct any more than you would trample the flag of the United States of America under foot. You must constantly bear in mind that in our country a military organization is too often judged by the acts of a few of its members. When one or two soldiers in uniform conduct themselves in an ungentlemanly or unmilitary manner to the disgrace of the uniform, the layman shakes his head and condemns all men wearing that uniform. Hence, show by the way in which you wear your uniform that you are proud of it; this can be best accomplished by observing the following rules:       1. Carry yourself at all times as though you were proud of         yourself, your uniform, and your country.       2. Wear your hat so that the brim is parallel to the ground.       3. Have all buttons fastened.       4. Never have sleeves rolled up.       5. Never wear sleeve holders.       6. Never leave shirt or coat unbuttoned at the throat.       7. Have leggins and trousers properly laced.       8. Keep shoes shined.       9. Always be clean shaved.      10. Keep head up and shoulders square.      11. Camp life has a tendency to make one careless as to personal         cleanliness. Bear this in mind.    SALUTING   The military salute is universal. It is at foundation but a courteous recognition between two individuals of their common fellowship in the same honorable profession, the profession of arms. Regulations require that it be rendered by both the senior and the junior, as bare courtesy requires between gentlemen in civil life. It is the military equivalent of the laymen's expressions \"Good Morning,\" or \"How do you do?\" Therefore be punctilious about saluting; be proud of the manner in which you execute your salute, and make it indicative of discipline and good breeding. Always look at the officer you are saluting. The junior salutes first. It is very unmilitary to salute with the left hand in a pocket, or with a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in the mouth. Observe the following general rules:       1. Never salute an officer when you are in ranks.       2. Indoors (in your tent) unarmed, do not salute but stand at         attention, uncovered, on the entrance of an officer. If he speaks         to you, then salute.       3. Indoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle         salute at order arms or at trail.       4. Outdoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle         salute at right shoulder arms.       5. Outdoors, unarmed, or armed with side arms, salute with the         right hand.    ARMY SLANG   The following army slang is universally employed:       \"Bunkie\"--the soldier who shares the shelter half or tent of a      comrade in the field. A bunkie looks after his comrade's property      in the event the latter is absent.       \"Doughboy\"--the infantryman.       \"French leave\"--unauthorized absence.       \"Holy Joe\"--the chaplain.       \"K.O.\"--the commanding officer.       \"On the carpet\"--a call before the commanding officer for      admonition.       \"Q.M.\"--quartermaster.       \"Rookie\"--a new recruit.       \"Sand rat\"--a soldier on duty in the rifle pit during target      practice.
