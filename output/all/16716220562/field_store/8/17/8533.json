Too well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in, and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they themselves most believe in.  Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body do they also believe most; and their own body is for them the thing-in-itself.  But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves preach backworlds.  Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a more upright and pure voice.  More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     IV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.  To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,--and thus be dumb.  “Body am I, and soul”--so saith the child. And why should one not speak like children?  But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”  The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.  An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest “spirit”--a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.  “Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater thing--in which thou art unwilling to believe--is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.  What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.  Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.  Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth, conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.  Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage--it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.  There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?  Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. “What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?” it saith to itself. “A by-way to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions.”  The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!” And thereupon it suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto--and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.  The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!” Thereupon it rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice--and for that very purpose it IS MEANT to think.  To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?  The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.  Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.  No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:--create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.  But it is now too late to do so:--so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.  To succumb--so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.  And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.  I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to the Superman!--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     V. JOYS AND PASSIONS.  My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one.  To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.  And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!  Better for thee to say: “Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.”  Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.  Thus speak and stammer: “That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do _I_ desire the good.  Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises.  An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom.  But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it--now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”  Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.  Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.  Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then became they thy virtues and joys.  And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;  All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.  Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming songstresses.  Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow, affliction, milkedst thou--now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her udder.  And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.  My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.  Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.  My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.  Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth thy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.  Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.  He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.  Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?  Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou love thy virtues,--for thou wilt succumb by them.--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     VI. THE PALE CRIMINAL.  Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh the great contempt.  “Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaketh it out of that eye.  When he judged himself--that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate!  There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it be speedy death.  Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!  It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own survival!  “Enemy” shall ye say but not “villain,” “invalid” shall ye say but not “wretch,” “fool” shall ye say but not “sinner.”  And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in thought, then would every one cry: “Away with the nastiness and the virulent reptile!”  But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll between them.  An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.  Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.  The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.  Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is BEFORE the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!  Thus speaketh the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!  But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him. “What matter about blood!” it said; “wishest thou not, at least, to make booty thereby? Or take revenge?”  And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon him--thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness.  And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.  Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who shaketh that head?  What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through the spirit; there they want to get their prey.  What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among themselves--so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.  Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself--it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the happiness of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1998"],["title","Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (#8)"],["body","knife.  Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.  Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to cause suffering.  But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!  Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this pale criminal!  Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in wretched self-complacency.  I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     VII. READING AND WRITING.  Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.  It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.  He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers--and spirit itself will stink.  Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.  Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.  He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart.  In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.  The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.  I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh.  I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh--that is your thunder-cloud.  Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted.  Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?  He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.  Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive--so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.  Ye tell me, “Life is hard to bear.” But for what purpose should ye have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?  Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all of us fine sumpter asses and assesses.  What have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a drop of dew hath formed upon it?  It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we are wont to love.  There is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some method in madness.  And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.  To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit about--that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.  I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.  And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity--through him all things fall.  Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the spirit of gravity!  I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to fly; since then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.  Now am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself. Now there danceth a God in me.--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     VIII. THE TREE ON THE HILL.  Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus:  “If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.  But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.”  Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra answered:  “Why art thou frightened on that account?--But it is the same with man as with the tree.  The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep--into the evil.”  “Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?”  Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.”  “Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more.  “Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen?  I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.  When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?  My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?  How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the height!”  Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus:  “This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high above man and beast.  And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high hath it grown.  Now it waiteth and waiteth,--for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first lightning?”  When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent gestures: “Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!”--Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.  And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak thus:  It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell me all thy danger.  As yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom. Too unslept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.  On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul. But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.  Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.  Still art thou a prisoner--it seemeth to me--who deviseth liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked.  To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his eye still to become.  Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not thy love and hope away!  Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.  Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.  The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth the good man, and that the old should be conserved.  But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.  Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they disparaged all high hopes.  Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day had hardly an aim.  “Spirit is also voluptuousness,”--said they. Then broke the wings of their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.  Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A trouble and a terror is the hero to them.  But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     IX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.  There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom desistance from life must be preached.  Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the “life eternal”!  “The yellow ones”: so are called the preachers of death, or “the black ones.” But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.  There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration.  They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach desistance from life, and pass away themselves!  There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation.  They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins!  They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse--and immediately they say: “Life is refuted!”  But they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only one aspect of existence.  Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for"]]]
