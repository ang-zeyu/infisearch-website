RECTOR OF THE ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL, EDINBURGH  FORMERLY PROFESSOR OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY  IN THE YORKSHIRE COLLEGE, LEEDS     LONDON  PERCIVAL AND CO.  1891  _All rights reserved_     PREFACE  The main purpose which I have had in view in writing this book has been to present an account of Greek philosophy which, within strict limits of brevity, shall be at once authentic and interesting--_authentic_, as being based on the original works themselves, and not on any secondary sources; _interesting_, as presenting to the ordinary English reader, in language freed as far as possible from technicality and abstruseness, the great thoughts of the greatest men of antiquity on questions of permanent significance and value.  There has been no attempt to shirk the really philosophic problems which these men tried in their day to solve; but I have endeavoured to show, by a sympathetic treatment of them, that these problems were no mere wars of words, but that in fact the philosophers of twenty-four centuries ago were dealing with exactly similar difficulties as to the bases of belief and of right action as, under different forms, beset thoughtful men and women to-day.  In the general treatment of the subject, I have followed in the main the order, and drawn chiefly on the selection of passages, in Ritter and Preller's _Historia Philosophiae Graecae_.  It is hoped that in this way the little book may be found useful at the universities, as a running commentary on that excellent work; and the better to aid students in the use of it for that purpose, the corresponding sections in Ritter and Preller are indicated by the figures in the margin.  In the sections on Plato, and occasionally elsewhere, I have drawn to some extent, by the kind permission of the Delegates of the Clarendon Press and his own, on Professor Jowett's great commentary and translation.  JOHN MARSHALL.     Transcriber's notes:  The passage numbers in the Ritter-Preller book mentioned in the second paragraph above are indicated in this book with square brackets, e.g. \"[10]\".  In the original book they were formatted as sidenotes.  In this e-book they are embedded in the text approximately where they appear in the original book, unless they are at the start of a paragraph, in which case they appear immediately before that paragraph.  Page numbers are indicated with curly brackets, e.g. \"{5}\".  They are embedded into the text where page breaks occurred in the original book.  In the original book, pages had headings that varied with the material being discussed on that pair of pages.  In this e-book, those headings have been collected into an \"introductory\" paragraph at the beginning of each chapter.   The original book uses several Greek words.  These words, the chapters they are used in, and their transliterations are as follows:  Chapter I (pages 3, 4, 12) - \"arche\" - alpha (with the soft-breathing mark), rho, chi, eta; \"phloios\" - phi, lambda, omicron, iota, omicron, final sigma.  Chapter III (page 28) - \"soma\" - sigma, omega, mu, alpha; \"sema\" - sigma, eta, mu, alpha.  Chapter IV (page 33, 34 - \"doxa\" - delta, omicron, xi, alpha; \"Peri\" - PI, epsilon, rho, iota; \"Phueos\" - PHI, upsilon, sigma, epsilon, omega, final sigma.  Chapter V (page 48) - \"logos\" - lambda, omicron, gamma, omicron, final sigma; \"hule\" - upsilon with rough breathing mark, lambda, eta.     CONTENTS   CHAP.

THALES.--For several centuries prior to the great Persian invasions of Greece, perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek world was Miletus.  Situate about the centre of the Ionian coasts of Asia Minor, with four magnificent harbours and a strongly defensible position, it gathered to itself much of the great overland trade, which has flowed for thousands of years eastward and westward between India and the Mediterranean; while by its great fleets it created a new world of its own along the Black Sea coast.  Its colonies there were so numerous that Miletus was named 'Mother of Eighty Cities.'  From Abydus on the Bosphorus, past Sinope, and so onward to the Crimea and the Don, and thence round to Thrace, a busy community of colonies, mining, manufacturing, ship-building, corn-raising, owned Miletus for their mother-city.  Its {2} marts must therefore have been crowded with merchants of every country from India to Spain, from Arabia to Russia; the riches and the wonders of every clime must have become familiar to its inhabitants.  And fitly enough, therefore, in this city was born the first notable Greek geographer, the first constructor of a map, the first observer of natural and other curiosities, the first recorder of varieties of custom among various communities, the first speculator on the causes of strange phenomena,--Hecataeus.  His work is in great part lost, but we know a good deal about it from the frequent references to him and it in the work of his rival and follower, Herodotus.  The city naturally held a leading place politically as well as commercially.  Empire in our sense was alien to the instincts of the Greek race; but Miletus was for centuries recognised as the foremost member of a great commercial and political league, the political character of the league becoming more defined, as first the Lydian and then the Persian monarchy became an aggressive neighbour on its borders.  [8]  It was in this active, prosperous, enterprising state, and at the period of its highest activity, that Thales, statesman, practical engineer, mathematician, philosopher, flourished.  Without attempting to fix his date too closely, we may take it that he was a leading man in Miletus for the greater part of the {3} first half of the sixth century before Christ.  We hear of an eclipse predicted by him, of the course of a river usefully changed, of shrewd and profitable handling of the market, of wise advice in the general councils of the league. He seems to have been at once a student of mathematics and an observer of nature, and withal something having analogy with both, an inquirer or speculator into the _origin_ of things.  To us nowadays this suggests a student of geology, or physiography, or some such branch of physical science; to Thales it probably rather suggested a theoretical inquiry into the simplest _thinkable_ aspect of things as existing. \"Under what form known to us,\" he would seem to have asked, \"may we assume an identity in all known things, so as best to cover or render explicable the things as we know them?\"  The 'beginning' of things (for it was thus he described this assumed identity) was not conceived by him as something which was long ages before, and which had ceased to be; rather it meant the reality of things now.  Thales then was the putter of a question, which had not been asked expressly before, but which has never ceased to be asked since.  He was also the formulator of a new meaning for a word; the word 'beginning' ((Greek) _arche_) got the meaning of 'underlying reality' and so of 'ending' as well.  In short, he so dealt with a word, on the surface of it implying {4} time, as to eliminate the idea of time, and suggest a method of looking at the world, more profound and far-reaching than had been before imagined.[1]  It is interesting to find that the man who was thus the first philosopher, the first observer who took a metaphysical, non-temporal, analytical view of the world, and so became the predecessor of all those votaries of 'other-world' ways of thinking,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20500"],["title","A Short History of Greek Philosophy (#1)"],["body","--whether as academic idealist, or 'budge doctor of the Stoic fur,' or Christian ascetic or what not, whose ways are such a puzzle to the 'hard-headed practical man,'--was himself one of the shrewdest men of his day, so shrewd that by common consent he was placed foremost in antiquity among the Seven Sages, or seven shrewd men, whose practical wisdom became a world's tradition, enshrined in anecdote and crystallised in proverb.  [9]  The chief record that we possess of the philosophic teaching of Thales is contained in an interesting notice of earlier philosophies by Aristotle, the main part of which as regards Thales runs as follows:  \"The early philosophers as a rule formulated the originative principle ((Greek) _arche_) of all things under some material expression.  By the originative principle or element of things they meant that of which all {5} existing things are composed, that which determines their coming into being, and into which they pass on ceasing to be.  Where these philosophers differed from each other was simply in the answer which they gave to the question what was the nature of this principle, the differences of view among them applying both to the number, and to the character, of the supposed element or elements.  \"Thales, the pioneer of this philosophy, maintained that _Water_ was the originative principle of all things.  It was doubtless in this sense that he said that the earth rested on water.  What suggested the conception to him may have been such facts of observation, as that all forms of substance which promote life are moist, that heat itself seems to be conditioned by moisture, that the life-producing seed in all creatures is moist, and so on.\"  Other characteristics of water, it is elsewhere suggested, may have been in Thales' mind, such as its readiness to take various shapes, its convertibility from water into vapour or ice, its ready mixture with other substances, and so forth.  What we have chiefly to note is, that the more unscientific this theory about the universe may strike us as being, the more completely out of accord with facts now familiar to everybody, the more striking is it as marking a new mood of mind, in which _unity_, though only very partially suggested or discoverable by the senses, is {6} preferred to that infinite and indefinite _variety_ and _difference_ which the senses give us at every moment.  There is here the germ of a new aspiration, of a determination not to rest in the merely momentary and different, but at least to try, even against the apparent evidence of the senses, for something more permanently intelligible.  As a first suggestion of what this permanent underlying reality may be, _Water_ might very well pass.  It is probable that even to Thales himself it was only a symbol, like the figure in a mathematical proposition, representing by the first passable physical phenomenon which came to hand, that ideal reality underlying all change, which is at once the beginning, the middle, and the end of all. That he did not mean Water, in the ordinary prosaic sense, to be identical with this, is suggested by some [10] other sayings of his. \"Thales,\" says Aristotle elsewhere, \"thought the whole universe was full of gods.\"  \"All things,\" he is recorded as saying, \"have a _soul_ in them, in virtue of which they move other things, and are themselves moved, even as the magnet, by virtue of its life or soul, moves the iron.\"  Without pushing these fragmentary utterances too far, we may well conclude that whether Thales spoke of the soul of the universe and its divine indwelling powers, or gods, or of water as the origin of things, he was only vaguely symbolising in different ways an idea as yet formless and void, like the primeval chaos, but nevertheless, {7} like it, containing within it a promise and a potency of greater life hereafter.  II. ANAXIMANDER.--Our information with respect to thinkers so remote as these men is too scanty and too fragmentary, to enable us to say in what manner or degree they influenced each other.  We cannot say for certain that any one of them was pupil or antagonist of another.  They appear each of them, one might say for a moment only, from amidst the darkness of antiquity; a few sayings of theirs we catch vaguely across the void, and then they disappear.  There is not, consequently, any very distinct progression or continuity observable among them, and so far therefore one has to confess that the title 'School of Miletus' is a misnomer.  We have already quoted the words of Aristotle in which he classes the Ionic philosophers together, as all of them giving a _material_ aspect of some kind to the originative principle of the universe (see above, P. 4).  But while this is a characteristic observable in some of them, it is not so obviously discoverable in the second of their number, Anaximander.  This philosopher is said to have been younger by [11] one generation than Thales, but to have been intimate with him.  He, like Thales, was a native of Miletus, and while we do not hear of him as a person, like Thales, of political eminence and activity, he was certainly the equal, if not the superior, of Thales in {8} mathematical and scientific ability.  He is said to have either invented or at least made known to Greece the construction of the sun-dial.  He was associated with Hecataeus in the construction of the earliest geographical charts or maps; he devoted himself with some success to the science of astronomy. His familiarity with the abstractions of mathematics perhaps accounts for the more abstract form, in which he expressed his idea of the principle of all things.  [21]  To Anaximander this principle was, as he expressed it, the _infinite_; not water nor any other of the so-called elements, but a different thing from any of them, something hardly namable, out of whose formlessness the heavens and all the worlds in them came to be.  And by necessity into that same infinite or indefinite existence, out of which they originally emerged, did every created thing return.  Thus, as he poetically expressed it, \"Time brought its revenges, and for the wrong-doing of existence all things paid the penalty of death.\"  The momentary resting-place of Thales on the confines of the familiar world of things, in his formulation of Water as the principle of existence, is thus immediately removed.  We get, as it were, to the earliest conception of things as we find it in Genesis; before the heavens were, or earth, or the waters under the earth, or light, or sun, or moon, or grass, or the beast of the field, when the \"earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the {9} face of the deep.\"  Only, be it observed, that while in the primitive Biblical idea this formless void precedes in _time_ an ordered universe, in Anaximander's conception this formless infinitude is always here, is in fact the only reality which ever is here, something without beginning or ending, underlying all, enwrapping all, governing all.  To modern criticism this may seem to be little better than verbiage, having, perhaps, some possibilities of poetic treatment, but certainly very unsatisfactory if regarded as science.  But to this we have to reply that one is not called upon to regard it as science.  Behind science, as much to-day when our knowledge of the details of phenomena is so enormously increased, as in the times when science had hardly begun, there lies a world of mystery which we cannot pierce, and yet which we are compelled to assume.  No scientific treatise can begin without assuming Matter and Force as data, and however much we may have learned about the relations of _forces_ and the affinities of _things_, Matter and Force as such remain very much the same dim infinities, that the originative 'Infinite' was to Anaximander.  It is to be noted, however, that while modern science assumes necessarily _two_ correlative data or originative principles,--Force, namely, as well as Matter,--Anaximander seems to have been content {10} with the formulation of but one; and perhaps it is just here that a kinship still remains between him and Thales and other philosophers of the school.  He, no more than they, seems to have definitely raised the question, How are we to account for, or formulate, the principle of _difference_ or change?  What is it that causes things to come into being out of, or recalls them back from being into, the infinite void? It is to be confessed, however, that our accounts on this point are somewhat conflicting.  One authority actually says that he formulated motion as eternal also.  So far as he attempted to grasp the idea of difference in relation to that of unity, he seems to have regarded the principle of change or difference as inhering in [13] the infinite itself.  Aristotle in this connection contrasts his doctrine with that of Anaxagoras, who formulated _two_ principles of existence--Matter and Mind (see below, p. 54).  Anaximander, he points out, found all he wanted in the one.  As a mathematician Anaximander must have been familiar in various aspects with the functions of the Infinite or Indefinable in the organisation of thought.  To the student of Euclid, for example, the impossibility of adequately defining any of the fundamental elements of the science of geometry--the point, the line, the surface--is a familiar fact.  In so far as a science of geometry is possible at all, the exactness, which is its essential characteristic, is only {11} attainable by starting from data which are in themselves impossible, as of a point which has no magnitude, of a line which has no breadth, of a surface which has no thickness.  So in the science of abstract number the fundamental assumptions, as that 1=1, _x=x_, etc., are contradicted by every fact of experience, for in the world as we know it, absolute equality is simply impossible to discover; and yet these fundamental conceptions are in their development most powerful instruments for the"]]]
