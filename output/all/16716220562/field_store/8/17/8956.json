Pell Rolls.]  At that period of our history, persons married at a much earlier age than is usually the case among us now; and the espousals of young people often preceded for some years the period of quitting their parents' home, and living together, as man and wife. In the year 1381 Henry, at that time only fifteen years of age, was espoused[9] to his future wife, Mary Bohun, daughter of the Earl of Hereford, who had (p. 008) then not reached her twelfth year. These espousals were in those days accompanied by the religious service of matrimony, and the bride assumed the title of her espoused husband.[10]                     [Footnote 9: In this same year Bolinbroke's life                    was put into imminent peril during the insurrection                    headed by Wat Tiler. The rebels broke into the                    Tower of London, though it was defended by some                    brave knights and soldiers; seized and murdered the                    Archbishop and others; and, carrying the heads of                    their victims on pikes, proceeded in a state of                    fury to John of Gaunt's palace at the Savoy, which                    they utterly destroyed and burnt to the ground.                    Gaunt himself was in the North: but his son                    Bolinbroke was in the Tower of London, and owed his                    life to the interposition of one John Ferrour of                    Southwark. This is a fact not generally known to                    historians; and since the document which records                    it, bears testimony to Bolinbroke's spirit of                    gratitude, it will not be thought out of place to                    allude to it here. This same John Ferrour, with Sir                    Thomas Blount and others, was tried in the Castle                    of Oxford for high treason, in the first year of                    Henry IV. Blount and the others were condemned and                    executed; but to John Ferrour a free pardon, dated                    Monday after the Epiphany, was given, \"our Lord the                    King remembering that in the reign of Richard the                    Second, during the insurrection of the Counties of                    Essex and Kent, the said John saved the King's life                    in the midst of that commonalty, in a wonderful and                    kind manner, whence the King happily remains alive                    unto this day. For since every good whatever                    naturally and of right requires another good in                    return, the King of his especial grace freely                    pardons the said John.\" Plac. Cor. in Cast. Oxon.]                     [Footnote 10: Thus, in a warrant, dated 6th March                    1381, an order is given by the Duke for payment to                    a Goldsmith in London, of 10_l._ 18_s._ for a                    present made by our dear daughter Philippa, to our                    very dear daughter Mary, Countess of Derby, on the                    day of her marriage; and also \"40 shillings for as                    many pence put upon the book on the day of the                    espousals of our much beloved son, the Earl of                    Derby.\" Eight marks are ordered to be paid for \"a                    ruby given by us to our very dear daughter Mary:\"                    13_s._ 4_d._ for the offering at the mass. Ten                    marks from us to the King's minstrels being there                    on the same day; and ten marks to four minstrels of                    our brother the Earl of Cambridge being there; and                    fifty marks to the officers of our cousin, the                    Countess of Hereford! On the 31st of January                    following, the Duke lays himself under a bond to                    pay to \"Dame Bohun, Countess of Hereford, her                    mother, the sum of one hundred marks annually, for                    the charge and cost of his daughter-in-law, Mary,                    Countess of Derby, until the said Mary shall attain                    the full age of fourteen years.\"]  We shall probably not be in error, if we fix the period of the Countess of Derby leaving her mother's for her husband's roof somewhere in the year 1386, when he was twenty, and she sixteen years old; and we are not without reason for believing that they made Monmouth Castle their home.  Some modern writers affirm that this was the favourite residence of John of Gaunt's family: but it is very questionable whether from having themselves experienced the beauty and loveliness of the spot, they have not been unconsciously tempted to venture this assertion (p. 009) without historical evidence. Monmouth is indeed situated in one of the fairest and loveliest valleys within the four seas of Britain. Near its centre, on a rising ground between the river Monnow (from which the town derives its name) and the Wye and not far from their confluence, the ruins of the Castle are still visible. The poet Gray looked over it from the side of the Kymin Hill, when he described the scene before him as \"the delight of his eyes, and the very seat of pleasure.\" With his testimony, unbiassed as it was by local attachment, it would be unwise to mingle the feelings of affection entertained by one whose earliest associations, \"redolent of joy and youth,\" can scarcely rescue his judgment from the suspicion of partiality. At that time John of Gaunt's estates and princely mansions studded, at various distances, the whole land of England from its northern border to the southern coast. And whether he allowed Henry of Bolinbroke to select for himself from the ample pages of his rent-roll the spot to which he would take his bride, or whether he assigned it of his own choice to his son as the fairest of his possessions; or whether any other cause determined the place of Henry the Fifth's birth, we have no reasonable ground for doubting that he was born in the Castle of Monmouth, on the 9th of August 1387.  Of Monmouth Castle, the dwindling ruins are now very scanty, and in point of architecture present nothing worthy of an antiquary's     (p. 010) research. They are washed by the streams of the Monnow, and are embosomed in gardens and orchards, clothing the knoll on which they stand; the aspect of the southern walls, and the rocky character of the soil admirably adapting them for the growth of the vine, and the ripening of its fruits. In the memory of some old inhabitants, who were not gathered to their fathers when the Author could first take an interest in such things, and who often amused his childhood with tales of former days, the remains of the Hall of Justice were still traceable within the narrowed pile; and the crumbling bench on which the Justices of the Circuit once sate, was often usurped by the boys in their mock trials of judge and jury. Somewhat more than half a century ago, a gentleman whose garden reached to one of the last remaining towers, had reason to be thankful for a marked interposition in his behalf of the protecting hand of Providence. He was enjoying himself on a summer's evening in an alcove built under the shelter and shade of the castle, when a gust of wind blew out the candle by his side, just at the time when he felt disposed to replenish and rekindle his pipe. He went consequently with the lantern in his hand towards his house, intending to renew his evening's recreation; but he had scarcely reached the door when the wall fell, burying his retreat, and the entire slope, with its shrubs and flowers and fruits, under one mass of ruin.  From this castle, tradition says, that being a sickly child, Henry (p. 011) was taken to Courtfield, at the distance of six or seven miles from Monmouth, to be nursed there. That tradition is doubtless very ancient; and the cradle itself in which Henry is said to have been rocked, was shown there till within these few years, when it was sold, and taken from the house. It has since changed hands, if it be any longer in existence. The local traditions, indeed, in the neighbourhood of Courtfield and Goodrich are almost universally mingled with the very natural mistake that, when Henry of Monmouth was born, his father was king; and so far a shade of improbability may be supposed to invest them all alike; yet the variety of them in that one district, and the total absence of any stories relative to the same event on every other side of Monmouth, should seem to countenance a belief that some real foundation existed for the broad and general features of these traditionary tales. Thus, though the account acquiesced in by some writers, that the Marchioness of Salisbury was Henry of Monmouth's nurse at Courtfield, may have originated in an officious anxiety to supply an infant prince with a nurse suitable to his royal birth; still, probably, that appendage would not have been annexed to a story utterly without foundation, and consequently throws no incredibility on the fact that the eldest son of the young Earl of Derby was nursed at Courtfield. Thus, too, though the recorded salutation of the ferryman of Goodrich congratulates his Majesty on the birth of a   (p. 012) noble prince, as the King was hastening from his court and palace of Windsor to his castle of Monmouth; yet the unstationary habits of Bolingbroke, his love of journeyings and travels, and his restlessness at home, render it very probable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20488"],["title","Henry of Monmouth, Volume 1 (#5)"],["body","he was absent from Monmouth even when the hour of perilous anxiety was approaching; and thus on his return homeward (perhaps too from Richard's court at Windsor) the first tidings of the safety of his Countess and the birth of the young lord may have saluted him as he crossed the Wye at Goodrich Ferry. So again in the little village of Cruse, lying between the church and the castle of Goodrich, the cottagers still tell, from father to son, as they have told for centuries over their winter's hearth, how the herald, hurrying from Monmouth to Goodrich fast as whip and spur could urge his steed onward, with the tidings of the Prince of Wales' birth, fell headlong, (the horse dropping under him in the short, steep, and rugged lane leading to the ravine, beyond which the castle stands,) and was killed on the spot. No doubt the idea of its being the news of a prince's birth, that was thus posted on, has added, in the imagination of the villagers, to the horse's fleetness and the breathless impetuosity of the messenger; but it is very probable that the news of the young lord's birth, heir to the dukedom of Lancaster, should have been hastened from the castle of Monmouth to Goodrich; and there is no solid reason for discrediting the story.           (p. 013)  Still, beyond tradition, there is no evidence at all to fix the young lord either at Courtfield, or indeed at Monmouth, for any period subsequently to his birth. On the contrary, several items of expense in the \"Wardrobe account of Henry, Earl of Derby,\" would induce us to infer either that the tradition is unfounded, or that at the utmost the infant lord was nursed at Courtfield only for a few months. In that account[11] we find an entry of a charge for a \"_long gown_\" for the young lord Henry; and also the payment of 2_l._ to a midwife for her attendance on the Countess during her confinement at the birth of the young lord Thomas, the gift of the Earl, \"_at London_\". By this document it is proved that Henry's younger brother, the future Duke of Clarence, was born before October 1388, and that some time in the preceding year Henry was himself still in the long robes of an infant; and that the family had removed from Monmouth to London. In the Wardrobe expenses of the Countess for the same year, we find several items of sums defrayed for the clothes of the young lords Henry and Thomas together, but no allusion whatever to the brothers being separate: one entry,[12] fixing Thomas and his nurse at Kenilworth soon after his birth, leaves no ground for supposing that his      (p. 014) elder brother was either at Monmouth or at Courtfield. It may be matter of disappointment and of surprise that Henry's name does not occur in connexion with the place of his birth in any single contemporary document now known. The fact, however, is so. But whilst the place of Henry's nursing is thus left in uncertainty, the name of his nurse--in itself a matter not of the slightest importance--is made known to us not only in the Wardrobe account of his mother, but also by a gratifying circumstance, which bears direct testimony to his own kind and grateful, and considerate and liberal mind. Her name was Johanna Waring; on whom, very shortly after he ascended the throne, he settled an annuity of 20_l._ \"in consideration of good service done to him in former days.\"[13]                     [Footnote 11: Between 30th Sept. 1387 and 1st Oct.                    1388.]                     [Footnote 12: An item of five yards of cloth for                    the bed of the nurse of Thomas at Kenilworth; and                    an ell of canvass for his cradle.]                     [Footnote 13: This is one of those incidents,                    occurring now and then, the discovery of which                    repays the antiquary or the biographer for wading,                    with toilsome search, through a confused mass of                    uninteresting details, and often encourages him to                    persevere when he begins to feel weary and                    disappointed.]  Very few incidents are recorded which can throw light upon Henry's childhood, and for those few we are indebted chiefly to the dry details of account-books. In these many particular items of expense occur relative as well to Henry as to his brothers; which, probably, would differ very little from those of other young noblemen of England at that period of her history. The records of the Duchy of Lancaster provide us with a very scanty supply of such particulars as convey (p. 015) any interesting information on the circumstances and occupations and amusements of Henry of Monmouth. From these records, however, we learn that he was attacked by some complaint, probably both sudden and dangerous, in the spring of 1395; for among the receiver's accounts is found the charge of \"6_s._ 8_d._ for Thomas Pye, and a horse hired at London, March 18th, to carry him to Leicester with all speed, on account of the illness of the young lord Henry.\" In the year 1397, when he was just ten years old, a few entries occur, somewhat interesting, as intimations of his boyish pursuits. Such are the charge of \"8_d._ paid by the hands of Adam Garston for harpstrings purchased for the harp of the young lord Henry,\" and \"12_d._ to Stephen Furbour for a new scabbard of a sword for young lord Henry,\" and \"1_s._ 6_d._ for three-fourths of an ounce of tissue of black silk bought at London of Margaret Stranson for a sword of young lord Henry.\" Whilst we cannot but be sometimes amused by the minuteness with which the expenditure of the smallest sum in so large an establishment as John of Gaunt's is detailed, these little incidents prepare us for the statement given of Henry's early youth by the chroniclers,--that he was fond both of minstrelsy and of military exercises.  The same dry pages, however, assure us that his more severe studies were not neglected. In the accounts for the year ending February 1396, we find a charge of \"4_s._ for seven books of Grammar contained    (p. 016) in one volume, and bought at London for the young Lord Henry.\" The receiver-general's record informs us of the name of the lord Humfrey's tutor;[14] but who was appointed to instruct the young lord Henry does not appear; nor can we tell how soon he was put under the guidance of Henry Beaufort. If, as we have reason to believe, he had that celebrated man as his instructor, or at least the superintendent of his studies, in Oxford so early as 1399, we may not, perhaps, be mistaken in conjecturing, that even this volume of Grammar was first learned under the direction of the future Cardinal.                     [Footnote 14: \"Thomæ Rothwell informanti Humfridum                    filium Domini Regis pro salario suo de termino                    Paschæ, 13_s._ 4_d._\"--1 Hen. IV.]  Scanty as are the materials from which we must weave our opinion with regard to the first years of Henry of Monmouth, they are sufficient to suggest many reflections upon the advantages as well as the unfavourable circumstances which attended him: We must first, however, revert to a few more particulars relative to his family and its chief members.  His father, who was then about twenty-four years of age, certainly left England[15] between the 6th of May 1390 and the 30th of April (p. 017) 1391, and proceeded to Barbary. During his absence his Countess was delivered of Humfrey, his fourth son. Between the summers of 1392 and 1393 he undertook a journey to Prussia, and to the Holy Sepulchre.                     [Footnote 15: The treasurer's account, during the                    Earl's absence, contains some items which remove                    all doubt from this statement: among others, 20_l._                    to Lancaster the herald, on Nov. 5, going toward                    England; and in the same month, to three                    \"persuivantes,\" being with the Earl, eight nobles;                    and to a certain English sailor, carrying the news                    of the birth of Humfrey, son of my lord, 13_s._                    4_d._]  The next year visited Henry with one of the most severe losses which can befall a youth of his age. His mother,[16] then only twenty-four years old, having given birth to four sons and two daughters, was taken away from the anxious cares and comforts of her earthly career, in the very prime of life.[17] Nor was this the only bereavement which befell the family at this time. Constance, the second wife of John of Gaunt, a lady to whose religious and moral worth the strongest and warmest testimony is borne by the chroniclers of the time; and who might (had it so pleased the Disposer of all things) have watched  (p. 018) over the education of her husband's grandchildren, was also this same year removed from them to her rest: they were both buried at Leicester, then one of the chief residences of the family.                     [Footnote 16: King Richard II, the Duke of                    Lancaster, and his son, Henry of Bolinbroke, became                    widowers in the same year.]                     [Footnote 17: That Henry cherished the memory of                    his mother with filial tenderness, may be inferred                    from the circumstance that only two months after he                    succeeded to the throne, and had the means and the                    opportunity of testifying his grateful remembrance                    of her, we find money paid \"in advance to William                    Goodyere for newly devising and making an image in                    likeness of the Mother of the present lord the                    King, ornamented with diverse arms of the kings of                    England, and placed over the tomb of the said                    king's mother, within the King's College at                    Leicester, where she is buried and entombed.\"--Pell                    Rolls, May 20, 1413.]  The mind cannot"]]]
