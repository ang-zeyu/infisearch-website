Then the boat was made fast, the oars put away, and the doctor and the colored man started for the Ruthven mansion.     CHAPTER XI.  MRS. RUTHVEN SPEAKS HER MIND.   Leaving the shore of the bay, St. John Ruthven walked slowly toward the home of his aunt.  It irritated him greatly to think that his cousin preferred the society of Jack to his own.  \"I must speak to Aunt Alice about this,\" he said to himself. \"It is getting worse and worse.\"  He found his aunt sitting in the garden reading. She looked up in surprise at his approach.  \"Aunt Alice, can you spare me a few minutes?\" he said, after the usual greeting.  \"Surely, St. John. What is it that you wish?\"  \"I wish to speak to you about Marion.\"  \"About Marion?\" Mrs. Ruthven looked somewhat surprised.  \"Yes. I saw her out again in a boat with that boy.\"  \"That boy? Do you mean Jack?\"  \"Yes. I wonder you trust her to his care--after what happened at the wreck.\"  \"Why should I not? Jack understands how to manage a boat. Marion is safe with her brother.\"  \"But he is not her brother,\" cried St. John.  \"Not in blood, perhaps, but in affection. They have been brought up together as children of one family.\"  \"My dear Aunt Alice, do you think you have done wisely in encouraging this intimacy?\" he said earnestly.  \"What can you mean?\" she demanded. \"Jack is fourteen years old and Marion is eighteen.\"  \"Of course. But you know nothing of the boy's parentage. He is an unknown waif, cast upon the shore in his infancy, very possibly of a low family.\"  \"No, you are wrong there. Remember, I saw his mother. Everything indicated her to be a lady. The child's clothing was of fine texture. But even if it were otherwise, he has endeared himself to me by his noble qualities. I regard him as a son.\"  St. John shrugged his shoulders. \"You look upon him with the eyes of affection. To me he seems----\"  \"Well?\"  \"A commonplace boy,--a mechanic's child, very possibly,--who is quite out of place among the Ruthvens.\"  At this Mrs. Ruthven grew indignant.  \"You are prejudiced!\" she cried. \"I will not discuss the matter farther with you. I wish no one to speak to me against Jack. He is as dear to me as Marion herself.\"  The young man drew a deep breath. \"I am silenced, Aunt Alice. But I wish to speak to you about Marion. She is no longer a child, but a young lady.\"  \"Yes, she is now eighteen,\" answered Mrs. Ruthven slowly. \"But to me she seems a child still.\"  \"Well--er--at what age did you marry, aunt?\"  \"At eighteen.\"  \"Then, Aunt Alice, you cannot be surprised if I have thought of Marion as my future wife. I love her warmly and sincerely.\"  At this abrupt declaration Mrs. Ruthven was considerably surprised.  \"Why, St. John, do you wish to marry that child?\" she exclaimed.  \"Why not? She is eighteen.\"  \"Yes, but I had never thought of her as old enough to be married. Have you spoken to her?\"  \"Yes,\" he returned slowly, and with a cloud on his face.  \"And what did she say?\"  \"Nothing--that is, she was taken by surprise and did not wish to discuss the matter at present.\"  Mrs. Ruthven drew a breath of relief. \"She was sensible. Have you any reason to think that she loves you?\"  \"I think she will soon. I am not conceited, Aunt Alice, but I think I have a good appearance and--I am a Ruthven.\"  \"You are much older than she, St. John.\"  \"I am, but a man of my age is still a young man.\"  \"I should not object if she loved you, but I have never seen any indications of it.\"  \"Will you let her know that you favor my suit?\"  At this Mrs. Ruthven shrugged her shoulders.  \"But I am not sure that I do,\" she returned slowly.  \"Have you heard anything to my discredit?\" he demanded stiffly.  \"No, no, St. John; but don't be precipitate. Let the matter rest for the present.\"  \"Well, if you insist upon it, Aunt Alice,\" he said, his face falling.  \"It seems to me best.\"  \"But still, Aunt Alice, if Marion allows her affections to drift in another direction----\"  \"I do not think she will, for the present. She is more interested in the war than in anything else. Why, if I would allow it, she would go off and offer her services as a nurse.\"  \"Don't let her go, aunt--I beg of you.\"  Mrs. Ruthven looked at her nephew curiously.  \"What makes you so afraid of this war, St. John?\"  \"Afraid? I am not afraid exactly,\" he stammered. \"I was thinking of dear Marion. It would be horrible for her to put up with the hardships, and such sights!\"  \"But somebody must bear such sights and sounds. War is war, and our beloved country must be sustained, even in her darkest hour.\"  He trembled and turned pale, but quickly recovered.  \"What you say is true, Aunt Alice. I have wanted to go to the front, but my mother positively refuses her permission. She is in mortal terror that the Yankees will come to our plantation and loot the place in my absence.\"  \"Do you think you can keep them from coming?\"  \"No, but I can--er--I can perhaps protect my mother.\"  \"If you went off, she could come over here and remain with me.\"  \"She wishes to remain at home. The old place is very dear to her. It would break her heart to have the enemy destroy it.\"  \"I should not wish our place destroyed. Yet the only way to keep the enemy back is to go to the front and fight them.\"  \"Well--I presume you are right, and I shall go some time--when I can win my mother over,\" said St. John lamely.  He wanted to speak of Marion again, but, on looking across the garden, saw his cousin and Jack approaching. Soon the pair came up and Marion greeted St. John with a slight bow.  \"We have been out rowing, mother,\" said Jack, as he came up and kissed Mrs. Ruthven. \"It was lovely on the bay.\"  \"Did you go far?\"  \"We went over to Hoskin's beach. Marion rowed part of the way.\"  \"I hope you had a nice time,\" said St. John stiffly, turning to Marion.  \"We had a lovely time,\" answered the girl. \"Jack is the best rower around here.\"  \"Humph! Why, he's only a boy!\" sneered the spendthrift.  \"Yes, I am only a boy, St. John, but I reckon I can row as good as you,\" replied our hero warmly. He had not forgotten the encounter on the road.  \"Do you, indeed?\"  \"Yes, I do. Some day we can try a race. I'll give you choice of boats and beat you.\"  At this Marion set up a merry laugh.  \"I believe Jack can beat you at rowing, St. John,\" she said.  \"I never race with boys,\" answered the spendthrift, more stiffly than ever.  \"I'll race you to-day,\" went on Jack. \"And I've rowed three or four miles already.\"  \"Oh, Jack! you are too tired and the sun is too strong,\" remonstrated Mrs. Ruthven, although inwardly pleased to see the lad stand up for himself.  \"I said I never raced with boys,\" said St. John.  \"I would like to see a race,\" came from Marion. \"I dare you to row Jack, St. John.\"  \"Let us make it to the rocks and back,\" said Jack. \"And you can have any of the boats you please. I dare you to do it,\" and he looked at St. John defiantly.  \"St. John may be tired. Perhaps he has been working,\" suggested Mrs. Ruthven, although she knew better.  \"No, he has been walking and resting along shore,\" said Marion. \"We saw him from our boat.\"  \"I'll give you another advantage, besides choice of boats,\" said Jack, bound that St. John should not back out. \"I'll carry Marion as extra weight.\"  \"Oh, that wouldn't be fair!\" cried the girl. \"Let St. John carry mamma.\"  \"No, I must decline to go,\" said Mrs. Ruthven.  \"I'll take Marion, and St. John need carry only himself,\" said our hero. \"I am certain I can beat him. I dare him to take me up.\"  There seemed no help for it, so St. John gave in, and soon the three were on the way to Old Ben's boathouse.     CHAPTER XII.  THE BOAT RACE ON THE BAY.   \"I think this is a very foolish proceeding,\" observed St. John as they walked along.  \"I think it's going to be lots of fun,\" replied Marion. \"The one who wins shall receive a lovely bunch of roses from me.\"  \"Then I'll win,\" said the spendthrift, and bestowed a meaning smile upon her, which instantly made her turn her head.  They used a short cut to the beach, consequently they did not meet Old Ben and Dr. Mackey.  When the boathouse was gained they went to inspect the four boats lying there.  St. John knew the boats well, for he was by no means an unskilled rower.  He picked out the lightest of the craft, one which was long and narrow, and also took the best pair of oars.  Marion was going to remonstrate, but Jack silenced her.  \"But, Jack, if you have a poor boat, and carry me, too----\" she began, in a whisper.  \"I'll beat him, anyway,\" replied our hero. \"I know I can do it.\"  Soon they had the boats out.  Marion half expected St. John to invite her to enter his craft, but in this she was mistaken. The spendthrift was afraid that the extra weight would prove fatal to his success. Yet it angered him to have his cousin go off with Jack.  \"Marion, you ought to remain on shore,\" he said. \"The race ought to be rowed with both boats empty.\"  \"Well, if you think best----\" she began.  \"No, Marion, you are to go with me,\" put in Jack hastily. \"I said I would row with you in my boat, and I will.\"  \"But I am quite a weight----\"  \"Never mind; jump in.\"  As there seemed no help for it, Marion entered Jack's boat and our hero"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20437"],["title","The Frog Prince and Other Stories (#0)"],["body","Frog Prince and other stories  By  Walter Crane   The Frog Prince Princess Belle-Etoile Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp   First published by George Routledge 1874     THE FROG PRINCE.   In the olden time, when wishing was having, there lived a King, whose daughters were all beautiful; but the youngest was so exceedingly beautiful that the Sun himself, although he saw her very often, was enchanted every time she came out into the sunshine.  Near the castle of this King was a large and gloomy forest, and in the midst stood an old lime-tree, beneath whose branches splashed a little fountain; so, whenever it was very hot, the King's youngest daughter ran off into this wood, and sat down by the side of this fountain; and, when she felt dull, would often divert herself by throwing a golden ball up in the air and catching it. And this was her favourite amusement.  Now, one day it happened, that this golden ball, when the King's daughter threw it into the air, did not fall down into her hand, but on the grass; and then it rolled past her into the fountain. The King's daughter followed the ball with her eyes, but it disappeared beneath the water, which was so deep that no one could see to the bottom. Then she began to lament, and to cry louder and louder; and, as she cried, a voice called out, \"Why weepest thou, O King's daughter? thy tears would melt even a stone to pity.\" And she looked around to the spot whence the voice came, and saw a Frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water. \"Ah! you old water-paddler,\" said she, \"was it you that spoke? I am weeping for my golden ball, which has slipped away from me into the water.\"  [Illustration]  \"Be quiet, and do not cry,\" answered the Frog; \"I can give thee good advice. But what wilt thou give me if I fetch thy plaything up again?\"  \"What will you have, dear Frog?\" said she. \"My dresses, my pearls and jewels, or the golden crown which I wear?\"  The Frog answered, \"Dresses, or jewels, or golden crowns, are not for me; but if thou wilt love me, and let me be thy companion and playfellow, and sit at thy table, and eat from thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,--if thou wilt promise me all these, then will I dive down and fetch up thy golden ball.\"  [Illustration]  \"Oh, I will promise you all,\" said she, \"if you will only get me my ball.\" But she thought to herself, \"What is the silly Frog chattering about? Let him remain in the water with his equals; he cannot mix in society.\" But the Frog, as soon as he had received her promise, drew his head under the water and dived down. Presently he swam up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was full of joy when she again saw her beautiful plaything; and, taking it up, she ran off immediately. \"Stop! stop!\" cried the Frog; \"take me with thee. I cannot run as thou canst.\" But all his croaking was useless; although it was loud enough, the King's daughter did not hear it, but, hastening home, soon forgot the poor Frog, who was obliged to leap back into the fountain.  The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with her father and all his courtiers, and was eating from her own little golden plate, something was heard coming up the marble stairs, splish-splash, splish-splash; and when it arrived at the top, it knocked at the door, and a voice said, \"Open the door, thou youngest daughter of the King!\" So she rose and went to see who it was that called her; but when she opened the door and caught sight of the Frog, she shut it again with great vehemence, and sat down at the table, looking very pale. But the King perceived that her heart was beating violently, and asked her whether it were a giant who had come to fetch her away who stood at the door. \"Oh, no!\" answered she; \"it is no giant, but an ugly Frog.\"  \"What does the Frog want with you?\" said the King.  \"Oh, dear father, when I was sitting yesterday playing by the fountain, my golden ball fell into the water, and this Frog fetched it up again because I cried so much: but first, I must tell you, he pressed me so much, that I promised him he should be my companion. I never thought that he could come out of the water, but somehow he has jumped out, and now he wants to come in here.\"  At that moment there was another knock, and a voice said,--      \"King's daughter, youngest,         Open the door.     Hast thou forgotten     Thy promises made     At the fountain so clear     'Neath the lime-tree's shade?     King's daughter, youngest,         Open the door.\"  Then the King said, \"What you have promised, that you must perform; go and let him in.\" So the King's daughter went and opened the door, and the Frog hopped in after her right up to her chair: and as soon as she was seated, the Frog said, \"Take me up;\" but she hesitated so long that at last the King ordered her to obey. And as soon as the Frog sat on the chair, he jumped on to the table, and said, \"Now push thy plate near me, that we may eat together.\" And she did so, but as everyone saw, very unwillingly. The Frog seemed to relish his dinner much, but every bit that the King's daughter ate nearly choked her, till at last the Frog said, \"I have satisfied my hunger and feel very tired; wilt thou carry me upstairs now into thy chamber, and make thy bed ready that we may sleep together?\" At this speech the King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold Frog, and dared not touch him; and besides, he actually wanted to sleep in her own beautiful, clean bed.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But her tears only made the King very angry, and he said, \"He who helped you in the time of your trouble, must not now be despised!\" So she took the Frog up with two fingers, and put him in a corner of her chamber. But as she lay in her bed, he crept up to it, and said, \"I am so very tired that I shall sleep well; do take me up or I will tell thy father.\" This speech put the King's daughter in a terrible passion, and catching the Frog up, she threw him with all her strength against the wall, saying, \"Now, will you be quiet, you ugly Frog?\"  But as he fell he was changed from a frog into a handsome Prince with beautiful eyes, who, after a little while became, with her father's consent, her dear companion and betrothed. Then he told her how he had been transformed by an evil witch, and that no one but herself could have had the power to take him out of the fountain; and that on the morrow they would go together into his own kingdom.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next morning, as soon as the sun rose, a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with ostrich feathers on their heads, and golden bridles, drove up to the door of the palace, and behind the carriage stood the trusty Henry, the servant of the young Prince. When his master was changed into a frog, trusty Henry had grieved so much that he had bound three iron bands round his heart, for fear it should break with grief and sorrow. But now that the carriage was ready to carry the young Prince to his own country, the faithful Henry helped in the bride and bridegroom, and placed himself in the seat behind, full of joy at his master's release. They had not proceeded far when the Prince heard a crack as if something had broken behind the carriage; so he put his head out of the window and asked Henry what was broken, and Henry answered, \"It was not the carriage, my master, but a band which I bound round my heart when it was in such grief because you were changed into a frog.\"  Twice afterwards on the journey there was the same noise, and each time the Prince thought that it was some part of the carriage that had given way; but it was only the breaking of the bands which bound the heart of the trusty Henry, who was thenceforward free and happy.     PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE.   Once upon a time there were three Princesses, named Roussette, Brunette, and Blondine, who lived in retirement with their mother, a Princess who had lost all her former grandeur. One day an old woman called and asked for a dinner, as this Princess was an excellent cook. After the meal was over, the old woman, who was a fairy, promised that their kindness should be rewarded, and immediately disappeared.  Shortly after, the King came that way, with his brother and the Lord Admiral. They were all so struck with the beauty of the three Princesses, that the King married the youngest, Blondine, his brother married Brunette, and the Lord Admiral married Roussette.  The good Fairy, who had brought all this about, also caused the young Queen Blondine to have three lovely children, two boys and a girl, out of whose hair fell fine jewels. Each had a brilliant star on the forehead, and a rich chain of gold around the neck. At the same time Brunette, her sister, gave birth to a handsome boy. Now the young Queen and Brunette were much attached to each other, but Roussette was jealous of both, and the old Queen, the King's mother, hated them. Brunette died soon after the birth of her son, and the King was absent on a warlike expedition, so Roussette joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to injure Blondine. They ordered Feintise, the old Queen's waiting-woman, to strangle the Queen's three children and the son of Princess Brunette, and bury them secretly. But as she was about to execute this wicked order, she was so struck by their beauty, and the appearance of the sparkling stars on their foreheads, that she shrank from the deed.  So she had a boat brought round to the beach, and put the four babes, with some strings of jewels, into a cradle, which she placed in the boat, and then set it adrift. The boat was soon far out at sea. The waves rose, the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared. Feintise could not doubt that the boat would be swamped, and felt relieved by the thought that the poor little innocents would perish, for she would otherwise always be haunted by the fear that something would occur to"]]]
