Afterward, meeting Master _Burly_, the Town Clark, demanded the Keyes of the Prison from him, which, being granted, they, with those Gentlemen formerly named, went again to the Town Hall to Treat, and came to an agreement, which was, that forty or fifty of their own men should keep the Town that night, being compleatly armed, which being performed (the morning issued) and they continued in arms till Tuesday morning: There are none as yet dead, but diverse dangerously hurt.  \"Master _Sheriffe_ taking _White's_ part, and striving to keep the Peace, was knockt down, and his head fearfully broke; it was God's mercy his braines were not beat out, but it should seem he had a clung[10] pate of his own.  [Footnote 10: Tough or strong.]  \"They went also without S. _George's_ gate, and did much injury to Mr. _Lee_.  \"As I am credibly informed, the injuries done are these.  \"They have beat down all the windowes of Mr. _Major's_ House, burnt the Stoups at the comming in of his dore, Master _Reeves'_ Windowes were broke, Master _Page_, and Master _Pollen_, one _Buchurst_, Captaine _Bridge_, _Thomas Harris_, a busie prating fellow, and others were sorely wounded.  \"It is Ordered that _Richard White_ and _Robert Hues_, being in fetters, be tryed according to the Law, and upon faire Composition, the multitude have delivered their Armes into the Hands of the City, upon engagements of the best of the City that no man shall further question or trouble them.\"  On this Christmas day, Parliament,[11] \"on Saturday, December 25th, commonly called Christmas day, received some complaints of the countenancing of malignant ministers in some parts of London, where they preach and use the Common Prayer Book, contrary to the order of Parliament, and some delinquent Ministers have power given them to examine and punish churchwardens, sequestrators, and others that do countenance delinquent ministers to preach, and commit them, if they see cause; upon which some were taken into Custody.\" One instance of this is given in Whitelocke's _Memorials_ (p. 286). \"Mr. Harris, a Churchwarden of St. Martius, ordered to be committed for bringing delinquents to preach there, and to be displaced from his office of Churchwarden.\"  [Footnote 11: Rushworth's _Historical Collections_, pt. iv. vol. ii. p. 944.]  And so it went on, the Parliament and Nonconformists doing their best to suppress Christ-tide, and the populace stubbornly refusing to submit, as is shown in a letter from Sir Thomas Gower to Mr. John Langley, on December 28, 1652.[12] \"There is little worth writing, most of the time being spent in endeavouring to take away the esteem held of Christmas Day, to which end, order was made that whoever would open shops should be protected by the State; yet I heard of no more than two who did so, and one of them had better have given Â£50, his wares were so dirtyed; and secondly, that no sermons should be preached, which was observed (for aught I hear) save at Lincoln's Inn.\"  [Footnote 12: Hist. MSS. Commission Reports, v. p. 192.]  Evelyn, who was a staunch Episcopalian, writes in deep despondency as to the keeping of Christ-tide. \"1652, Dec. 25, Christmas day, no Sermon any where, no church being permitted to be open, so observed it at home. The next day, we went to Lewisham, where an honest divine preached.\" \"1653, Dec. 25, Christmas-day. No churches, or public assembly. I was fain to pass the devotions of that Blessed day with my family at home.\" \"1654, Dec. 25, Christmas-day. No public offices in Churches, but penalties on observers, so as I was constrained to celebrate it at home.\"  On November 27, 1655, Cromwell promulgated an edict, prohibiting all ministers of the Church of England from preaching or teaching in any schools, and Evelyn sadly notes the fact. \"Dec. 25. There was no more notice taken of Christmas day in Churches. I went to London, where Dr. Wild preached the funeral sermon of Preaching,[13] this being the last day; after which, Cromwell's proclamation was to take place, that none of the Church of England should dare either to preach, or administer Sacraments, teach school, etc., on pain of imprisonment or exile. So this was the mournfullest day that in my life I had seen, or the Church of England herself, since the Reformation; to the great rejoicing of both Papist and Presbyter. So pathetic was his discourse, that it drew many tears from the auditory. Myself, wife, and some of our family received the Communion: God make me thankful, who hath hitherto provided for us the food of our souls as well as bodies! The Lord Jesus pity our distressed Church, and bring back the captivity of Zion!\"  [Footnote 13: His text was 2 Cor. xiii. 9.]  His next recorded Christ-tide was an eventful one for him, and he thus describes it: \"1657, Dec. 25. I went to London with my wife to celebrate Christmas day, Mr. Gunning preaching in Exeter Chapel, on Michah vii. 2. Sermon ended, as he was giving us the Holy Sacrament, the Chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the Communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away. It fell to my share to be confined to a room in the house, where yet I was permitted to dine with the master of it, the Countess of Dorset, Lady Hatton, and some others of quality who invited me. In the afternoon, came Colonel Whalley, Goffe, and others, from Whitehall, to examine us one by one; some they committed to the Marshal, some to prison. When I came before them, they took my name and abode, examined me why, contrary to the ordinance made, that none should any longer observe the superstitious time of the Nativity (so esteemed by them), I durst offend, and particularly be at Common Prayers, which they told me was but the Mass in English, and particularly pray for Charles Stuart, for which we had no Scripture. I told them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for all Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors. They replied, in doing so we prayed for the King of Spain, too, who was their enemy, and a Papist, with other frivolous and ensnaring questions and much threatening; and, finding no colour to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity of my ignorance. These were men of high flight and above ordinances, and spake spiteful things of our Lord's Nativity. As we went up to receive the Sacrament, the miscreants held their muskets against us, as if they would have shot us at the Altar, but yet suffering us to finish the Office of the Communion, as, perhaps, not having instructions what to do, in case they found us in that action. So I got home late the next day: blessed be God!\"  Cromwell himself seems to have been somewhat ashamed of these persecutions and severities, for[14] (25th December 1657) \"Some Congregations being met to observe this day, according to former solemnity, and the _Protector_ being moved that Souldiers might be sent to repress them, he advised against it, as that which was contrary to the _Liberty of Conscience_ so much owned and pleaded for by the _Protector_ and his friends; but, it being contrary to Ordinances of Parliament (which were also opposed in the passing of them) that these days should be so solemnized, the _Protector_ gave way to it, and those meetings were suppressed by the Souldiers.\"  [Footnote 14: Whitelock's _Memorials_, ed. 1682, p. 666.]  But his life was drawing to a close, and with the Restoration of the king came also that of Christ-tide, and there was no longer any need of concealment, as Pepys tells us how he spent his Christmas day in 1662. \"Had a pleasant walk to White Hall, where I intended to have received the Communion with the family, but I came a little too late. So I walked up into the house, and spent my time looking over pictures, particularly the ships in King Henry the VIII.ths voyage to Bullaen; marking the great difference between those built then and now. By and by down to the Chapel again, where Bishop Morley[15] preached upon the Song of the Angels, 'Glory to God on high, on earth peace, and good will towards men.' Methought he made but a poor Sermon, but long, and, reprehending the common jollity of the Court for the true joy that shall and ought to be on these days; he particularized concerning their excess in playes and gaming, saying that he whose office it is to keep the gamesters in order and within bounds, serves but for a second rather in a duell, meaning the groome-porter. Upon which it was worth observing how far they are come from taking the reprehensions of a bishop seriously, that they all laugh in the Chapel when he reflected on their ill actions and courses. He did much press us to joy in these public days of joy, and to hospitality; but one that stood by whispered in my eare that the Bishop do not spend one groate to the poor himself. The Sermon done, a good anthem followed with vialls, and the King come down to receive the Sacrament. But I staid not, but, calling my boy from my Lord's lodgings, and giving Sarah some good advice, by my Lord's order, to be sober, and look after the house, I walked home again with great pleasure, and there dined by my wife's bed side with great content, having a mess of brave plum-porridge and a roasted pullet for dinner, and I sent for a mince pie abroad, my wife not being well, to make any herself yet.\"  [Footnote 15: Bishop of Winchester, died 1684.]  The popular love of Christmas is well exemplified in a little 16mo book, printed in 1678, entitled \"The Examination and Tryal of old Father CHRISTMAS; Together with his Clearing by the Jury, at the Assizes held at the Town of _Difference_, in the County of _Discontent_.\" The Jury was evidently a packed one. \"Then saith the _Clerk_ to the _Cryer_, count them--_Starve-mouse_, one, _All-pride_, two, _Keep-all_, three, _Love-none_, four, _Eat-alone_, five, _Give-little_, six, _Hoard-corn_, seven,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1998"],["title","Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (#0)"],["body","SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA  A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE   By Friedrich Nietzsche   Translated By Thomas Common   PG Editorâs Note:  Archaic spelling and punctuation usages have not been changed.

Notes on âThus Spake Zarathustraâ by Anthony M. Ludovici.     INTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.  HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.  âZarathustraâ is my brotherâs most personal work; it is the history of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by different names; âbut in the end,â he declares in a note on the subject, âI had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his âHazar,â--his dynasty of a thousand years.â  All Zarathustraâs views, as also his personality, were early conceptions of my brotherâs mind. Whoever reads his posthumously published writings for the years 1869-82 with care, will constantly meet with passages suggestive of Zarathustraâs thoughts and doctrines. For instance, the ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings during the years 1873-75; and in âWe Philologistsâ, the following remarkable observations occur:--  âHow can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?--Even among the Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.â  âThe Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared such a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible? The question is one which ought to be studied.  âI am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their evil instincts.  âWITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. Here we may still be hopeful: in the rearing of exceptional men.â  The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal Nietzsche already had in his youth, that âTHE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALSâ (or, as he writes in âSchopenhauer as Educatorâ: âMankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great men--this and nothing else is its duty.â) But the ideals he most revered in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No, around this future ideal of a coming humanity--the Superman--the poet spread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious heights man can still ascend? That is why, after having tested the worth of our noblest ideal--that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations, the poet cries with passionate emphasis in âZarathustraâ:  âNever yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest and the smallest man:--  All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the greatest found I--all-too-human!â--  The phrase âthe rearing of the Superman,â has very often been misunderstood. By the word ârearing,â in this case, is meant the act of modifying by means of new and higher values--values which, as laws and guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In general the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with other ideas of the authorâs, such as:--the Order of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have been seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations must be placed over mankind--namely, that of the strong, mighty, and magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith--the Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing, which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and âmodernâ race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system of valuing would be: âAll that proceeds from power is good, all that springs from weakness is bad.â  This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.  The author of âZarathustraâ never lost sight of that egregious example of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively short time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such revolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?  In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression âSupermanâ (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying âthe most thoroughly well-constituted type,â as opposed to âmodern manâ; above all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman. In âEcco Homoâ he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring to a certain passage in the âGay Scienceâ:--  âIn order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this condition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS. I know not how to express my meaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in one of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the âGaya Scienzaâ.â  âWe, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,â--it says there,--âwe firstlings of a yet untried future--we"]]]
