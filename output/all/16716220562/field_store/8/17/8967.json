It contained a single bed, a chest of drawers, a washstand, and a wardrobe. The latter, a cumbrous article of furniture, stood between the bed and the wall, against the side nearest to Mr. Glenthorpe's room.  Galloway strode across to the window, which was open, and looked out. The hillside fell away so rapidly that the bottom of the window was quite eight feet from the ground outside.  \"Not much of a drop for an athletic young fellow like Ronald,\" said Galloway to Colwyn, who had joined him.  \"The window is very much smaller than the one in Mr. Glenthorpe's bedroom,\" said Colwyn.  \"But large enough for a man to get through. Look here! I can get my head and shoulders through, and where the head and shoulders go the rest of the body will follow. Ronald got through it last night and into the next room by the other window. There can be no doubt that that was how the murder was committed.\"  Galloway left the window, and examined the bedroom carefully. He turned down the bed-clothes, and scrutinised the sheets and pillows.  \"I thought he might have left some blood-stains on the linen, after carrying the body downstairs,\" he explained. \"But he hasn't.\"  \"Sir Henry says the bleeding was largely internal,\" remarked Mr. Cromering. \"That would account for the absence of any tell-tale marks on the bed-clothes.\"  \"He was too clever to wash his hands when he came back,\" grumbled Galloway, turning to the washstand and examining the towels. \"He's a cool customer.\"  \"I notice that the candle in the candlestick is a wax one,\" said Colwyn.  \"And burnt more than half-way down,\" commented Galloway, glancing at it.  \"You attach no significance to the fact that the candle is a wax one?\" questioned the detective.  \"No, do you?\" replied Galloway, with a puzzled glance.  Colwyn did not reply to the question. He was looking attentively at the large wardrobe by the side of the bed.  \"That's a strange place to put a wardrobe,\" he said. \"It would be difficult to get out of bed without barking one's shins against it.\"  \"It was probably put there to hide the falling wall-paper,--the place is going to rack and ruin,\" said Galloway, pointing to the top of the wardrobe, where the faded wall-paper, mildewed and wet with damp, was hanging in festoons. \"Now, Queensmead, lead the way outside. I've seen all I want to see in this room.\"  \"Would you like to see the room where Ronald and Mr. Glenthorpe dined?\" suggested the constable. \"It's on this floor, on the other side of Mr. Glenthorpe's bedroom.\"  \"We can see that later. I want to examine outside before it gets dark.\"  They left the room. The innkeeper was waiting patiently in the passage, standing motionless at the head of the staircase, with his head inclining forward, like a marsh heron fishing in a dyke. He hastened towards them.  \"I noticed a reading-lamp by Mr. Glenthorpe's bedside, Mr. Benson,\" said Colwyn. \"Did he use that as well as the gas?\"  \"He rarely used the gas, sir, though it was put into the room at his request. He found the reading-lamp suited his sight better.\"  \"Did he use candles? I saw no candlestick in the room.\"  \"He never used candles, sir--only the reading-lamp.\"  \"When was the gas-globe smashed? Last night?\"  \"It must have been, sir. Ann says it was quite all right yesterday.\"  \"I've got my own idea how that was done,\" said Galloway, who had been an attentive listener to the innkeeper's replies to Colwyn's questions. \"Show the way downstairs to the back door, Mr. Benson.\"  The innkeeper preceded them down the stairs and along the passage to another one, which terminated in a latched door, which he opened.  \"How was this door fastened last night?\" asked Galloway.  \"By this bolt at the top,\" said the innkeeper, pointing to it. \"There is no key--only this catch.\"  \"Is this the only back outlet from the inn?\" asked Colwyn.  \"Yes, sir.\"  At Galloway's suggestion they first went to the side of the inn, in order to examine the ground beneath the windows. The fence enclosing the yard had fallen into disrepair, and had many gaps in it. There were no footprints visible in the red clay of the natural passage-way between the inn wall and the hill, either beneath the window of Ronald's room or Mr. Glenthorpe's window.  \"The absence of footprints means nothing,\" said Galloway. \"Ronald may have climbed from one room to the other in his stocking feet, and then put on his boots to remove the body. Even if he wore his boots he might have left no marks, if he walked lightly.\"  \"I am not so sure of that,\" said Colwyn. \"But what do you make of this?\"  He pointed to an impression in the red earth underneath Mr. Glenthorpe's window--a line so faint as to be barely noticeable, running outward from the wall for about eighteen inches, with another line about the same length running at right angles from it. Superintendent Galloway examined these two lines closely and then shook his head as though to intimate he could make nothing of them.  \"What do you think they are?\" said Mr. Cromering, turning to Colwyn.  \"I think they may have been made by a box,\" was the reply.  \"You are not suggesting that the murderer threw a box out of the window?\" exclaimed Superintendent Galloway, staring at the detective. \"Look how straight the line from the wall is! A box would have fallen crookedly.\"  \"I do not suggest anything of the kind. If it was a box, it is more likely it was placed outside the window.\"  \"For what purpose?\"  \"To help the murderer climb into the room.\"  \"He didn't need it,\" replied Galloway. \"It's an easy matter to get through this window from the ground. I can do it myself.\" He placed his hands on the sill, sprang on to the window ledge, and dropped back again. \"I attach no importance to these lines. They are so faint that they might have been made months ago. There is nothing to be seen here, so we may as well go and look at the footprints. Show us where the marks of the footsteps commence, Queensmead.\"  The constable led the way to the other side of the house and across the green. The grass terminated a little distance from the inn in a clay bank bordering a wide tract of bare and sterile land, which extended almost to the summit of the rise. Clearly defined in the clay and the black soft earth were two sets of footprints, one going towards the rise, and the other returning. The outgoing footsteps were deeply and distinctly outlined from heel to toe. The right foot plainly showed the circular mark of a rubber heel, which was missing in the other, though a sharp indentation showed the mark of the spike to which the rubber had been fastened.  \"The footprints lead straight to the mouth of the pit where the body was thrown,\" said Queensmead.  \"What a clue!\" exclaimed Superintendent Galloway, his eyes sparkling with excitement. \"You are quite certain the inn servant can swear that these marks were made by Ronald's boots, Queensmead?\"  \"There's no doubt on that point, sir,\" replied the constable. \"She had the boots in her hands this morning, just before Ronald put them on, and she distinctly noticed that there was a rubber heel on the right boot, but not on the other.\"  \"It seems a strange thing for a young man of Ronald's position to have rubber heels affixed to his boots,\" remarked Mr. Cromering. \"I was under the impression that they were an economical device of the working classes. But perhaps he found them useful to save his feet from jarring.\"  \"We shall find them useful to hang him,\" responded Galloway curtly. \"Let us proceed to the pit, gentlemen. May I ask you to keep clear of the footprints? I do not want them obliterated before I can take plaster casts.\"  They followed the footsteps up the rise. Near the summit they disappeared in a growth of nettles, but reappeared on the other side, skirting a number of bowl-shaped depressions clustered in groups along the brow of the rise. These were the hut circles--the pit dwellings of the early Britons, shallow excavations from six to eight feet deep, all running into one another, and choked with a rank growth of weeds. Between them and a little wood which covered the rest of the summit was an open space, with a hole gaping nakedly in the bare earth.  \"That's the pit where the body was thrown,\" said Queensmead, walking to the brink.  The pit descended straight as a mining shaft until the sides disappeared in the interior gloom. It was impossible to guess at its depth because of the tangled creepers which lined its sides and obscured the view, but Mr. Cromering, speaking from his extensive knowledge of Norfolk geology, said it was fully thirty feet deep. He added that there was considerable difference of opinion among antiquaries to account for its greater depth. Some believed the pit was simply a larger specimen of the adjoining hut circles, running into a natural underground passage which had previously existed. But the more generally accepted theory was that the hut circles marked the site of a prehistoric village, and the deeper pit had been the quarry from which the Neolithic men had obtained the flints of which they made their implements. These flints were imbedded in the chalk a long way from the surface, and to obtain them the cave men burrowed deeply into the clay, and then excavated horizontal galleries into the chalk. Several of the red-deer antler picks which they used for the purpose had been discovered when the pit was first explored twenty-five years ago.  \"Mr. Glenthorpe was very much interested in the prehistoric and late Stone Age remains which are to be found in abundance along the Norfolk coast,\" he added. \"He has enriched the national museums with a valuable collection of prehistoric man's implements and utensils, which he recovered in various parts of Norfolk. For some time past he had been carrying out explorations in this district in order to add to the collection. It is sad to think that he met his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20496"],["title","Legends of the Rhine (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                              LEGENDS OF THE RHINE                               BY                         WILHELM RULAND                 WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM PAINTINGS                     BY CELEBRATED ARTISTS                           8TH EDITION                             KÖLN AM RHEIN                 VERLAG VON HOURSCH & BECHSTEDT           \"O, the pride of the German heart is this noble river!

Last year I made the journey between Mainz and Bonn on one of our splendid Rhine steamers. Our vessel glided along like a great water-bird. On the shore rose mountains, castles, and ruins, and over all the sun shined brightly from a blue August sky. It was twelve years since I had visited the scenes of my youth, and every Rhinelander will understand with what pleasure I saw again those smiling landscapes arrayed in their summer beauty. Wandering back to my deck-chair, I soon became absorbed in the ever-changing panorama.  Then the sound of a melodious female voice speaking English fell on my ears. I looked around. A girl was bending over a book, and entertaining her father and mother by reading something of special interest and beauty. I listened and recognised some of my own sentences rendered into the speech of Shakespeare. These three were learning to feel the charms of the Lorelei legend as I had felt it. I confess my pulse beat quicker as I heard my poor endeavours highly praised, and I could not refrain from advancing and thanking the young reader for her kindly appreciation of my endeavours. She seemed delighted when she discovered that I was the author, and rose to greet me in the most amiable manner. I complimented the travellers that during the past century the Rhine had become the home of romance for the English speaking nations, the same as Italy for the Germans. The girl smiled, and remarked that I must pay that compliment to her mother in particular, as she was by birth an Englishwoman. But the head of the family hastened to add that among Americans, whom he might speak for, the enthusiasm for the beauties of the Rhine was not less than among their Anglo-Saxon cousins. These two nations which are bound by so many ties to each other, and also to ourselves, were thus represented before me. The English-speaking people undoubtedly form by far the largest contingent of our Rhine travellers, and it was pleasant indeed to receive so fine a testimonial to the beauties of my birth place.  We had a most interesting conversation, and I was not a little moved, as I observed that these foreigners who had travelled over half the world, and had seen the grandeur of Switzerland and the charms of Italy, should have such an unaffected admiration for our grand old river. I am rather sorry for those who neglect the Rhine. \"Aren't Lohengrin and Siegfried, immortalised by the great Master of Bayreuth, also heroic figures in your Rhine legends?\" remarked the young Anglo-American enthusiastically. It was the first time I had seriously thought of this. I was indeed touched, and my thoughts travelled back to the days of \"long, long ago\" when as a little chap in my native Bonn, I had first listened with interest to the charming voices of the golden-haired daughters of old Albion who came in large numbers to reside in the famous Beethoven-town.  As I separated from my friends at the foot of the Drachenfels I gave them a small present to keep as a memento of the Rhine and one of its poets.        München, Mai 1906.

GOTTHARD  The Petrified Alp   [Illustration: Aus dem Quellgebiet des Rheines--Near the Source of the Rhine--Au pays du Rhin]  In the region where the Rhine has its source there towered in ancient times a green Alp. This Alp belonged to an honest peasant, and along with a neat little house in the valley below formed his only possession.  The man died suddenly and was deeply mourned by his wife and child. Some days after an unexpected visitor was announced to the widow. He was a man who had much pastureland up in that region, but for a long time his one desire had been to possess the Alp of his neighbour now deceased, as by it his property would be rounded off to his satisfaction.  Quickly making his resolution he declared to the dismayed woman that the Alp belonged to him: her husband had secretly pledged it to him in return for a loan, after the bad harvest of the previous year. When the widow angrily accused him of being a liar the man produced a promissory note, spread it out, and with a hard laugh showed her his statement was confirmed in black and white. The distressed woman burst into tears and declared it was impossible that her late husband should have made a secret transaction of such a nature. The Alp was the sole inheritance of their son, and never would she willingly surrender it.  \"I will pay you compensation for the renunciation of your claim, although nothing obliges me to do so,\" declared the visitor with apparent compassion, in the meantime producing his purse.  The weeping woman motioned to him to put back his gold and told him to go, which he did.  Three days later the widow was summoned before the judge. There the neighbour produced his document and repeated his demand for the possession of the disputed Alp.  The judge, who had been shamefully bribed, declared the document valid and awarded the Alp to the pursuer. The broken-hearted widow staggered home.  The new possessor of the Alp on the other hand hastened up to the mountains at full gallop. The man could no longer master his impatience to see for the first time as his legally recognised property the pastureland he had acquired by deceit.  There, for three days a storm had raged uninterruptedly. As quickly as the soaked ways would permit he ascended to the high country.  Having arrived he stared around with"]]]
