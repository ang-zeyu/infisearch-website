Such was the outward aspect of things in August, 1572, but there were not wanting rumours that already Coligny, taking advantage of the footing given him, had gained an influence over the young king, which threatened Catharine de' Medici herself.  The admiral, therefore, to whom the Huguenot half of France had long looked as to its leader, was now the object of the closest interest to all; the Guise faction, hating him--as the alleged assassin of the Duke of Guise--with an intensity which probably was not to be found in the affection of his friends, popular with the latter as he was.  Still, many who were not Huguenots had a regard for him as a great Frenchman and a gallant soldier.  We--though we were of the old faith, and the other side--had heard much of him, and much good.  The Vicomte had spoken of him always as a great man, a man mistaken, but brave, honest and capable in his error.  Therefore it was that when the landlord mentioned him, I forgot even my hunger.  \"He was shot, my lords, as he passed through the Rue des Fosses, yesterday,\" the man declared with bated breath.  \"It is not known whether he will live or die.  Paris is in an uproar, and there are some who fear the worst.\"  \"But,\" I said doubtfully, \"who has dared to do this?  He had a safe conduct from the king himself.\"  Our host did not answer; shrugging his shoulders instead, he opened the door, and ushered us into the eating-room.  Some preparations for our meal had already been made at one end of the long board.  At the other was seated a man past middle age; richly but simply dressed.  His grey hair, cut short about a massive head, and his grave, resolute face, square-jawed, and deeply-lined, marked him as one to whom respect was due apart from his clothes.  We bowed to him as we took our seats.  He acknowledged the salute, fixing us a moment with a penetrating glance; and then resumed his meal.  I noticed that his sword and belt were propped against a chair at his elbow, and a dag, apparently loaded, lay close to his hand by the candlestick.  Two lackeys waited behind his chair, wearing the badge we had remarked in the inn yard.  We began to talk, speaking in low tones that we might not disturb him. The attack on Coligny had, if true, its bearing on our own business. For if a Huguenot so great and famous and enjoying the king's special favour still went in Paris in danger of his life, what must be the risk that such an one as Pavannes ran?  We had hoped to find the city quiet. If instead it should be in a state of turmoil Bezers' chances were so much the better; and ours--and Kit's, poor Kit's--so much the worse.  Our companion had by this time finished his supper.  But he still sat at table, and seemed to be regarding us with some curiosity. At length he spoke.  \"Are you going to Paris, young gentlemen?\" he asked, his tone harsh and high-pitched.  We answered in the affirmative.  \"To-morrow?\"  he questioned.  \"Yes,\" we answered; and expected him to continue the conversation.  But instead he became silent, gazing abstractedly at the table; and what with our meal, and our own talk we had almost forgotten him again, when looking up, I found him at my elbow, holding out in silence a small piece of paper.  I started his face was so grave.  But seeing that there were half-a-dozen guests of a meaner sort at another table close by, I guessed that he merely wished to make a private communication to us; and hastened to take the paper and read it.  It contained a scrawl of four words only--    \"Va chasser l'Idole.\"  No more.  I looked at him puzzled; able to make nothing out of it.  St. Croix wrinkled his brow over it with the same result. It was no good handing it to Marie, therefore.  \"You do not understand?\"  the stranger continued, as he put the scrap of paper back in his pouch.  \"No,\" I answered, shaking my head.  We had all risen out of respect to him, and were standing a little group about him.  \"Just so; it is all right then,\" he answered, looking at us as it seemed to me with grave good-nature.  \"It is nothing.  Go your way. But--I have a son yonder not much younger than you, young gentlemen. And if you had understood, I should have said to you, 'Do not go! There are enough sheep for the shearer!'\"  He was turning away with this oracular saying when Croisette touched his sleeve.  \"Pray can you tell us if it be true,\" the lad said eagerly, \"that the Admiral de Coligny was wounded yesterday?\"  \"It is true,\" the other answered, turning his grave eyes on his questioner, while for a moment his stern look failed him, \"It is true, my boy,\" he added with an air of strange solemnity.  \"Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.  And, God forgive me for saying it, whom He would destroy, He first maketh mad.\"  He had gazed with peculiar favour at Croisette's girlish face, I thought:  Marie and I were dark and ugly by the side of the boy. But he turned from him now with a queer, excited gesture, thumping his gold-headed cane on the floor.  He called his servants in a loud, rasping voice, and left the room in seeming anger, driving them before him, the one carrying his dag, and the other, two candles.  When I came down early next morning, the first person I met was Blaise Bure.  He looked rather fiercer and more shabby by daylight than candlelight.  But he saluted me respectfully; and this, since it was clear that he did not respect many people, inclined me to regard him with favour.  It is always so, the more savage the dog, the more highly we prize its attentions.  I asked him who the Huguenot noble was who had supped with us.  For a Huguenot we knew he must be.  \"The Baron de Rosny,\" he answered; adding with a sneer, \"He is a careful man!  If they were all like him, with eyes on both sides of his head and a dag by his candle--well, my lord, there would be one more king in France--or one less!  But they are a blind lot:  as blind as bats.\"  He muttered something farther in which I caught the word \"to-night.\"  But I did not hear it all; or understand any of it.  \"Your lordships are going to Paris?\"  he resumed in a different tone. When I said that we were, he looked at me in a shamefaced way, half timid, half arrogant.  \"I have a small favour to ask of you then,\" he said.  \"I am going to Paris myself.  I am not afraid of odds, as you have seen.  But the roads will be in a queer state if there be anything on foot in the city, and--well, I would rather ride with you gentlemen than alone.\"  \"You are welcome to join us,\" I said.  \"But we start in half-an-hour. Do you know Paris well?\"  \"As well as my sword-hilt,\" he replied briskly, relieved I thought by my acquiescence, \"And I have known that from my breeching.  If you want a game at PAUME, or a pretty girl to kiss, I can put you in the way for the one or the other.\"  The half rustic shrinking from the great city which I felt, suggested to me that our swashbuckling friend might help us if he would.  \"Do you know M. de Pavannes?\"  I asked impulsively, \"Where he lives in Paris, I mean?\"  \"M. Louis de Pavannes?\"  quoth he.  \"Yes.\"  \"I know--\" he replied slowly, rubbing his chin and looking at the ground in thought--\"where he had his lodgings in town a while ago, before--Ah!  I do know!  I remember,\" he added, slapping his thigh, \"when I was in Paris a fortnight ago I was told that his steward had taken lodgings for him in the Rue St. Antoine.\"  \"Good!\"  I answered overjoyed.  \"Then we want to dismount there, if you can guide us straight to the house.\"  \"I can,\" he replied simply.  \"And you will not be the worse for my company.  Paris is a queer place when there is trouble to the fore, but your lordships have got the right man to pilot you through it.\"  I did not ask him what trouble he meant, but ran indoors to buckle on my sword, and tell Marie and Croisette of the ally I had secured.  They were much pleased, as was natural; so that we took the road in excellent spirits intending to reach the city in the afternoon.  But Marie's horse cast a shoe, and it was some time before we could find a smith.  Then at Etampes, where we stopped to lunch, we were kept an unconscionable time waiting for it.  And so we approached Paris for the first time at sunset.  A ruddy glow was at the moment warming the eastern heights, and picking out with flame the twin towers of Notre Dame, and the one tall tower of St. Jacques la Boucherie.  A dozen roofs higher than their neighbours shone hotly; and a great bank of cloud, which lay north and south, and looked like a man's hand stretched over the city, changed gradually from blood-red to violet, and from violet to black, as evening fell.  Passing within the gates and across first one bridge and then another, we were astonished and utterly confused by the noise and hubbub through which we rode.  Hundreds seemed to be moving this way and that in the narrow streets.  Women screamed to one another from window to window. The bells of half-a-dozen churches rang the curfew.  Our country ears were deafened.  Still our eyes had leisure to take in the tall houses with their high-pitched roofs, and here and there a tower built into the wall; the quaint churches, and the groups of townsfolk--sullen fellows some of them with a fierce gleam in their eyes--who, standing in the mouths of reeking alleys, watched us go by.  But presently we had to stop.  A crowd had gathered to watch a little cavalcade of six gentlemen pass across our path.  They were riding two and two, lounging in their saddles and chattering to one another, disdainfully unconscious of the people about them, or the remarks they excited.  Their graceful bearing and the richness of their dress and equipment surpassed anything I had ever seen.  A dozen pages and lackeys were attending them on foot, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2041"],["title","The House of the Wolf: A Romance (#7)"],["body","the sound of their jests and laughter came to us over the heads of the crowd.  While I was gazing at them, some movement of the throng drove back Bure's horse against mine.  Bure himself uttered a savage oath; uncalled for so far as I could see.  But my attention was arrested the next moment by Croisette, who tapped my arm with his riding whip. \"Look!\"  he cried in some excitement, \"is not that he?\"  I followed the direction of the lad's finger--as well as I could for the plunging of my horse which Bure's had frightened--and scrutinized the last pair of the troop.  They were crossing the street in which we stood, and I had only a side view of them; or rather of the nearer rider.  He was a singularly handsome man, in age about twenty-two or twenty-three with long lovelocks falling on his lace collar and cloak of orange silk.  His face was sweet and kindly and gracious to a marvel.  But he was a stranger to me.  \"I could have sworn,\" exclaimed Croisette, \"that that was Louis himself--M. de Pavannes!\"  \"That?\"  I answered, as we began to move again, the crowd melting before us.  \"Oh, dear, no!\"  \"No!  no!  The farther man!\"  he explained.  But I had not been able to get a good look at the farther of the two. We turned in our saddles and peered after him.  His back in the dusk certainly reminded me of Louis.  Bure, however, who said he knew M. de Pavannes by sight, laughed at the idea.  \"Your friend,\" he said, \"is a wider man than that!\"  And I thought he was right there--but then it might be the cut of the clothes. \"They have been at the Louvre playing paume, I'll be sworn!\"  he went on.  \"So the Admiral must be better. The one next us was M. de Teligny, the Admiral's son-in-law.  And the other, whom you mean, was the Comte de la Rochefoucault.\"  We turned as he spoke into a narrow street near the river, and could see not far from us a mass of dark buildings which Bure told us was the Louvre--the king's residence.  Out of this street we turned into a short one; and here Bure drew rein and rapped loudly at some heavy gates.  It was so dark that when, these being opened, he led the way into a courtyard, we could see little more than a tall, sharp-gabled house, projecting over us against a pale sky; and a group of men and horses in one corner. Bure spoke to one of the men, and begging us to dismount, said the footman would show us to M. de Pavannes.  The thought that we were at the end of our long journey, and in time to warn Louis of his danger, made us forget all our exertions, our fatigue and stiffness.  Gladly throwing the bridles to Jean we ran up the steps after the servant.  The thing was done.  Hurrah!  the thing was done!  The house--as we passed through a long passage and up some steps--seemed full of people.  We heard voices and the ring of arms more than once.  But our guide, without pausing, led us to a small room lighted by a hanging lamp.  \"I will inform M. de Pavannes of your arrival,\" he said respectfully, and passed behind a curtain, which seemed to hide the door of an inner apartment.  As he did so the clink of glasses and the hum of conversation reached us.  \"He has company supping with him,\" I said nervously.  I tried to flip some of the dust from my boots with my whip.  I remembered that this was Paris.  \"He will be surprised to see us,\" quoth Croisette, laughing--a little shyly, too, I think.  And so we stood waiting.  I began to wonder as minutes passed by--the gay company we had seen putting it in my mind, I suppose--whether M. de Pavannes, of Paris, might not turn out to be a very different person from Louis de Pavannes, of Caylus; whether the king's courtier would be as friendly as Kit's lover.  And I was still thinking of this without having settled the point to my satisfaction, when the curtain was thrust aside again.  A very tall man, wearing a splendid suit of black and silver and a stiff trencher-like ruff, came quickly in, and stood smiling at us, a little dog in his arms.  The little dog sat up and snarled:  and Croisette gasped. It was not our old friend Louis certainly!  It was not Louis de Pavannes at all.  It was no old friend at all, It was the Vidame de Bezers!  \"Welcome, gentlemen!\"  he said, smiling at us--and never had the cast been so apparent in his eyes.  \"Welcome to Paris, M. Anne!\"    CHAPTER IV.  ENTRAPPED!  There was a long silence.  We stood glaring at him, and he smiled upon us--as a cat smiles.  Croisette told me afterwards that he could have died of mortification--of shame and anger that we had been so outwitted.  For myself I did not at once grasp the position.  I did not understand.  I could not disentangle myself in a moment from the belief in which I had entered the house--that it was Louis de Pavannes' house. But I seemed vaguely to suspect that Bezers had swept him aside and taken his place.  My first impulse therefore--obeyed on the instant--was to stride to the Vidame's side and grasp his arm.  \"What have you done?\"  I cried, my voice sounding hoarsely even in my own ears.  \"What have you done with M. de Pavannes?  Answer me!\"  He showed just a little more of his sharp white teeth as he looked down at my face--a flushed and troubled face doubtless. \"Nothing--yet,\" he replied very mildly.  And he shook me off.  \"Then,\" I retorted, \"how do you come here?\"  He glanced at Croisette and shrugged his shoulders, as if I had been a spoiled child.  \"M. Anne does not seem to understand,\" he said with mock courtesy, \"that I have the honour to welcome him to my house the Hotel Bezers, Rue de Platriere.\"  \"The Hotel Bezers!  Rue de Platriere!\"  I cried confusedly.  \"But Blaise Bure told us that this was the Rue St. Antoine!\"  \"Ah!\"  he replied as if slowly enlightened--the hypocrite!  \"Ah! I see!\"  and he smiled grimly.  \"So you have made the acquaintance of Blaise Bure, my excellent master of the horse! Worthy Blaise! Indeed, indeed, now I understand.  And you thought, you whelps,\" he continued, and as he spoke his tone changed strangely, and he fixed us suddenly with angry eyes, \"to play a rubber with me!  With me, you imbeciles! You thought the wolf of Bezers could be hunted down like any hare! Then listen, and I will tell you the end of it.  You are now in my house and absolutely at my mercy.  I have two score men within call who would cut the throats of three babes at the breast, if I bade them! Ay,\" he, added, a wicked exultation shining in his eyes, \"they would, and like the job!\"  He was going on to say more, but I interrupted him.  The rage I felt, caused as much by the thought of our folly as by his arrogance, would let me be silent no longer.  \"First, M. de Bezers, first,\" I broke out fiercely, my words leaping over one another in my haste, \"a word with you!  Let me tell you what I think of you!  You are a treacherous hound, Vidame!  A cur!  a beast!  And I spit upon you!  Traitor and assassin!\"  I shouted, \"is that not enough?  Will nothing provoke you? If you call yourself a gentleman, draw!\"  He shook his head; he was still smiling, still unmoved.  \"I do not do my own dirty work,\" he said quietly, \"nor stint my footmen of their sport, boy.\"  \"Very well!\"  I retorted.  And with the words I drew my sword, and sprang as quick as lightning to the curtain by which he had entered. \"Very well, we will kill you first!\"  I cried wrathfully, my eye on his eye, and every savage passion in my breast aroused, \"and take our chance with the lackeys afterwards! Marie!  Croisette!\"  I cried shrilly, \"on him, lads!\"  But they did not answer!  They did not move or draw.  For the moment indeed the man was in my power.  My wrist was raised, and I had my point at his breast, I could have run him through by a single thrust. And I hated him.  Oh, how I hated him!  But he did not stir.  Had he spoken, had he moved so much as an eyelid, or drawn back his foot, or laid his hand on his hilt, I should have killed him there.  But he did not stir and I could not do it.  My hand dropped.  \"Cowards!\"  I cried, glancing bitterly from him to them--they had never failed me before. \"Cowards!\"  I muttered, seeming to shrink into myself as I said the word.  And I flung my sword clattering on the floor.  \"That is better!\"  he drawled quite unmoved, as if nothing more than words had passed, as if he had not been in peril at all. \"It was what I was going to ask you to do.  If the other young gentlemen will follow your example, I shall be obliged.  Thank you.  Thank you.\"  Croisette, and a minute later Marie, obeyed him to the letter!  I could not understand it.  I folded my arms and gave up the game in despair, and but for very shame I could have put my hands to my face and cried. He stood in the middle under the lamp, a head taller than the tallest of us; our master.  And we stood round him trapped, beaten, for all the world like children.  Oh, I could have cried!  This was the end of our long ride, our aspirations, our knight-errantry!  \"Now perhaps you will listen to me,\" he went on smoothly, \"and hear what I am going to do.  I shall keep you here, young gentlemen, until you can serve me by carrying to mademoiselle, your cousin, some news of her betrothed.  Oh, I shall not detain you long,\" he added with an evil smile.  \"You have arrived in Paris at a fortunate moment.  There is going to be a--well, there is a little scheme on foot appointed for to-night--singularly lucky you are!--for removing some objectionable people, some friends of ours perhaps among them, M. Anne.  That is all. You will hear shots, cries, perhaps screams.  Take no notice.  You will be in no danger.  For M. de Pavannes,\" he continued, his voice sinking, \"I think that by morning I shall be able to give you a--a more particular account of him to take to Caylus--to Mademoiselle, you understand.\"  For a moment the mask was off.  His face took a sombre brightness.  He moistened his lips with his tongue as though he saw his vengeance worked out then and there before him, and were gloating over the picture.  The idea that "]]]
