You don't suppose his brother, the squire, with a wife and family of his own, would have kept them, though the Beauchamps had received her civilly enough at the time of the marriage! She had to milk the cows when the cow-man was otherwise wanted. I do not say that many a better born woman than she was has not done as much and thought little of it, only it was not in Aunt Penny's line. I can just remember her when I was a small boy, a pretty creature who read Italian, sang to her guitar, and made bread seals for her amusement. She had such a mortal terror where cows were concerned that she would run like a lapwing when she heard one come lowing up the lane behind the house. Paton, the man from Sydney who remembered them, thought they did a little better towards the end, when they got a store, and Mrs. Beauchamp kept it. Do you hear that, Maria?\" cried the Doctor, with a half-humorous, half-indignant emphasis.  \"Yes, I hear,\" replied Mrs. Millar, with an obstinate inflection of her voice which said, \"I am of my own opinion still.\" She illustrated this by adding, in an undertone, \"They were in Australia.\"  \"A store,\" continued the Doctor, \"is the rudest, most uncouth kind of shop; and Beauchamp was not fit to keep it, he had to turn it over to his wife, who was thankful to serve shepherds and bush-rangers for aught I know. She lost one child in the bush, God help her! The little thing wandered away and was never heard of again; and her other child, a boy, who grew up, did not turn out well. I tell you, I never like to think or speak of the mother.\"  \"Poor Aunt Penny!\" said Mrs. Millar hastily. \"But there is one thing\"--with a sudden accent of triumph in the perception that she had the advantage of her husband at last--\"your Aunt Penny married the man she cared for; she got her choice, and in that light she had no reason to complain, though she had to abide by it.\"  The Doctor was a little taken aback. \"I do not know that she complained--at least her people at home heard nothing of it. And you must do me the justice of owning that I have done nothing to force Dora's inclinations. Indeed, I am not clear that I have done my duty. I ought to have reasoned with the girl. Robinson is not only a good man, he is also a gentleman, every inch of him, so was his father before him.\"  \"In the choice of Jenny Coppock, of Coppock's Farm, for a wife!\" exclaimed Mrs. Millar, still rebellious, even satirical and disdainful.  \"He was entitled to choose whom he would, I suppose, so long as she was an honest woman, and Jenny Coppock was that quite as much as her husband was a gentleman. She made him happy, I believe, strange as it may sound to some people, as ladies do not always make their husbands happy--you know I mean nothing personal, Maria. Whether she was quite happy herself is a different question, of which I have had no means of judging. But I have heard you yourself say that she never presumed on her rise in rank, or sought to thrust her comely, kindly face where it was not wanted. Her son has a look of her, without her good looks. Poor Mrs. Robinson! I was with her in her first and last illness, as you are aware, and a more courageous, self-forgetful soul I had never the privilege to attend.\"  Mrs. Millar turned back in the conversation, and took to dogmatizing. \"People who are well-informed and well-bred will never descend to a lower level without great discomfort and serious loss. I for one, though I have not profited by the advantages the girls have commanded, and I daresay have not their brains\"--she made the frank admission with womanly, motherly humility--\"though I could not to save my life make one of Rose's beautiful water-colour sketches, or read Greek and Latin like 'little May,' or even talk to the point on every subject under the sun like Annie, still I should not be happy if I had to keep company with Wilkins the butcher's or Ord the baker's wife, and they would not be happy either. It would not matter, in one sense, though I knew they were respectable, worthy women, and were ever so much better off as to money than I. That would not keep me from feeling thoroughly out of place and having hardly an idea in common with my neighbours in their plush-trimmed gowns and fur-lined mantles. I could not stand such degradation for my girls,\" she protested, with rising agitation. \"I had far rather that they and I should be the poorest ladies in the land, should have to pinch and deny ourselves all round.\"  \"It is little you know of it,\" muttered Dr. Millar, shaking his white head, and pensively contemplating his finger-nails.  \"While we still retained the position to which we were born, and the associations among which we were reared,\" ended Mrs. Millar, with a gasp.  \"Bless the woman, what does she mean?\" cried Dr. Millar after his lively fashion, with an air of injured innocence. \"Does she pretend that Tom Robinson has not been educated--stamped, for that matter, with the last university brand, to which he does credit, I must say? Stay, there goes the night-bell. I am wanted for somebody.\"  \"You'll never go out again to-night, Jonathan,\" pleaded Mrs. Millar, \"after all your worry, when you have not had more than a couple of hours' rest.\" She was already reproaching herself keenly for having contradicted and argued with him. She had never been able to comprehend, for her comfort, that to a man like him an argument is both rousing and refreshing. In the middle of her remorse she instinctively held up her head, and balanced her cap as a Dutchwoman of the last century balanced her milk-pail, or a girl of the Roman Campagna her sheaf of grass and wild flowers. \"It is a shame,\" she reflected indignantly; \"it is very likely nothing of any consequence, just one of those inconsiderate people who think that a professional man ought to be always at their beck and call.\"  \"There, Maria, you're scoring another point for trade,\" said the little doctor, getting on his feet, and buttoning up his coat as a preliminary to obeying the call. \"I'll warrant Wilkins and Ord will be toasting their toes, and retiring to bed with the comfortable conviction that their night's rest will not be disturbed; since Wilkins's head-man attends to the slaughter-house, and the eldest journeyman baker sees to the setting of the sponge. Why don't you say, _noblesse oblige_, Maria? But I think I know the name of the inconsiderate individual who has interrupted our conversation, and I assure you he would not if he could. It is little Johnny Fleming--Fleming the grocer's son--whose case is critical, I fear. I told his mother if he got worse to send for me at once. When I am out, at any rate, I'll just look in on old Todd, in Skinners' Buildings. He appeared in a dying state this morning; but as the family have not sent to let me know of the death, if he has hung on so long, the chance is he will rally and come round this bout. I'll be some time; don't sit up for me, my dear.\"  \"It is too bad,\" Mrs. Millar fretted. \"They ought to send at night for Newton or Capes from Woodleigh--it is only a step for any of the young doctors, instead of disturbing a man of your age.\"  \"Good heavens! don't breathe such a thing. I could not afford it. I thought of taking a young partner twenty years ago, but I put it off till it was too late. Perhaps it was a mistake; we all make mistakes,\" he sighed. \"An active young practitioner, well up to date, might have kept the business better together.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried his wife energetically. \"Nobody would have looked at him when they could have had your skill and experience.\"  \"Then be thankful I'm still fit for work--one must take the bad with the good. It is the fortune of war, Maria,\" said the gallant old doctor as he departed.     CHAPTER IV.  THE CRASH.   Within a month Carey's Bank broke, not altogether unexpectedly. The breaking carried dismay and desolation into not a few households in Redcross, and administered a sharp shock--productive of much startled speculation, and roused distrust, even in those quarters which had not suffered financially by the bankruptcy. The stoppage of a bank, with little hope of its resuming its functions, is like the stoppage of a heart which will never beat again. It may have been dreaded as a possible calamity, and occasionally hinted at in awed whispers; but when the blow falls it does so with a stunning, crushing force because of its irreparable nature and far-reaching ruin.  There was just a little preparation to herald the catastrophe. Poor Carey, an honest, weak tool of dishonest speculators and birds of prey in the shape of needy, unscrupulous relations, when the appalling tidings reached him which could only betoken immediate wreck, did all that there was left to him to do. He called a meeting of the Redcross shareholders. These were the leading professional men in the town who had invested their savings, and a small proportion of the neighbouring country gentlemen who had put a little capital--not often to spare in those days--in a concern once regarded as sound and incapable of collapse as the Bank of England itself. With a faltering tongue and a hanging head the nominal head of the firm told to those nearly concerned what was coming on them. Nobody reproached him; either no man had the heart, or all felt the uselessness of reproaches. Certainly these shareholders' silence was his heaviest punishment.  They made a hasty examination, as far as they could, for themselves, and then the meeting broke up. Its members did not even linger to consult, being well assured that consultation, like reproaches, would be of no avail; the failure was so much more extensive and complete than their worst fears had led them to anticipate. The men looked blankly in each other's whitening faces and sought the refuge of their own houses at first. There would be time enough for outcry, for desperate plans and schemes a little later.  Poor Dr. Millar had not even this "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20081"],["title","A Houseful of Girls (#7)"],["body","space. It happened to be a particularly busy day with him. Various neutral individuals, in no way concerned with Carey's Bank, even when its misfortunes should be made public, took that inconvenient time for falling ill, and their medical man had to attend upon them with spasmodic promptitude and mechanical attention--projected, as it were, against the dazed and confused background of his brain. After all he was glad of his profession with its outward and immediate calls, taking him out of himself in the hour when he had heard the worst. He preferred to be about the town doing battle with this man's attack of paralysis and that woman's symptoms of typhoid, even though his ears were ringing with clamorous questions which no one else could hear or answer. How was he to pay up the liabilities of his bank shares from his dwindling practice? What about inexperienced young girls driven out to make their own way in the world, and the gentlewoman (in every sense of the word) whom he had loved and cherished for four-and-twenty years, soon to be left a desolate, all but unprovided for widow? But better a thousand times to be dragged in different directions than to be sitting like Russell, locked in his room, his little children and their young mother shut out, holding between his hands the erect head of a soldier who had come out of many a hard battle, but none so hard as this ambuscade which had been sprung upon him after he had been invalided a dozen years before, and returned home to spend his declining years in peace. Better than to have to write sermons and read prayers, like the Rector, and pause between every sentence to take himself sternly to task. Was it common forethought and prudence, with the necessity of providing for the wants of a household, which even the apostle Paul had commended, or was it worldly-mindedness and greed which had brought him, a beneficed clergyman, a priest in holy orders, the vowed servant of a King whose kingdom was not of this world, to this lamentable pass? Yes; he would be dishonoured in the eyes of men, a debtor who could not pay his debts, and even with the support of his bishop would be scarcely able to weather the storm, while he must make up his mind, as he was an honest man, that he and his should endure the pinch of poverty for the rest of his days.  Annie and Dora had been out on a shopping expedition, and were coming in talking and laughing as usual, when they were startled by the apparition of their mother standing in the doorway of her room, and motioning to them to come in directly and speak with her. The poor lady really looked like a ghost, as she stood there with her fine colour gone, beckoning to her daughters with her hand, as if the power of speech had suddenly forsaken her.  \"What is it, mother?\" cried the alarmed girls in one breath, hurrying towards her. \"Has anything happened? Is anybody ill?\"  \"Hush! hush, my dears,\" said Mrs. Millar in a low tone, carefully shutting the door of her room behind the girls, as if she were ready to guard her secret with her life--at the same time painfully sensible that the bad news would be all over Redcross the next day, or the next after that. \"I thought it would be better to tell you myself; nobody in the house knows anything of it yet, except your father and me.\"  \"But what is it, mother; you have not told us?\" Annie urged; while Mrs. Millar sank down in a low wicker chair, and her daughter Dora instinctively stooped over her, and began to set her vagrant cap right.  \"Never mind my cap, my love,\" said Mrs. Millar hurriedly, and then she grew incoherent. \"What does it matter, when perhaps I may not long have a cap to wear.\"  Annie and Dora stared at each other in consternation. Was their mother going out of her senses?  \"It is the bank, Carey's Bank,\" said Mrs. Millar, recovering herself, \"Oh dear! I am afraid it is in a very bad way.\"  \"Is that it?\" cried Annie vaguely but gravely, opening wide her brown eyes. \"Is it going to fail?\" She, too, spoke of the bank as if it were a responsible being.  \"Annie, Annie, take care what you say. Girls are so heedless. I tell you it is very dangerous to make such broad statements. You do not know what harm you may do by a single word when you are so childishly outspoken.\" Mrs. Millar felt bound even yet to give her own words the timid qualification, though she was forced to add the next moment, \"Your father has suspected things were going wrong for some time, and spoken of his suspicions to me repeatedly. He has just come back from a private meeting of the Redcross shareholders. He says in consequence of some additional losses in South America, I think, and inability to realize capital there, the bank cannot meet two or three heavy calls at home. I daresay I am not telling you rightly, for I don't understand business, and I don't suppose you do.\"  \"I understand so far, that if this is not failure, I don't know what is,\" said Annie.  \"Don't, Annie,\" said Dora; \"let mother tell us in her own way; it is not easy for her, it is a dreadful misfortune.\"  \"You may say that, Dora,\" exclaimed her mother. \"Your father does not believe the bank can hold out for another week; it may stop payment to-morrow, since there are rumours afloat which will destroy what credit it has left.\"  \"Will no other bank help it?\" cried Annie shrewdly.  \"I believe not,\" said Mrs. Millar dolefully.  \"Then there will be a run, like what one has read of in similar circumstances--a rush of the people, and a riot in the town,\" suggested Annie, getting excited over the idea. \"The police may have to guard the bank and the Bank house--soldiers may have to come from Nenthorn!\"  \"Oh, surely not,\" cried Dora; \"the poor Careys--who could treat them so cruelly?\"  \"No, no,\" said Mrs. Millar; \"there is one good thing, your father does not think there will be much ill-feeling, or anything like an angry mob, or tumult--not even when the people see the closed doors. There has always been such confidence in Carey's Bank, the Careys have been respected for generations; even now it is James Carey's misfortune and not his fault, though he may have been misled and imposed upon; and, after all, the depositors are tolerably sure of their money in time. But your father is afraid,\" she ended, her voice sinking, \"that it will go hard with the shareholders.\"  \"And poor father is one of them,\" said Annie quickly.  \"Poor father!\" echoed Dora piteously; \"and you, poor, poor mother, to have to think of us, and break it to us, while your heart is with father.\"  \"And he has not even been left in peace for a single afternoon, to make up his mind what we shall do,\" lamented his sympathetic wife. \"As usual, so many tiresome people have fallen ill--as if they did it on purpose, and sent for him.\"  \"I daresay they could not help it,\" said Annie, \"and I don't think it would quite suit father if they were never ill.\"  \"Don't speak so unfeelingly, child,\" remonstrated her mother; \"well, I suppose I gave you a bad example,\" she corrected herself immediately, \"but I have been in such trouble since lunch time.\"  \"Poor mother!\" repeated Dora in a voice that was only more soft and caressing because of its sorrowfulness. She was very fond of her mother, who reciprocated the special fondness, while Dr. Millar was rather inclined to favour Annie and Rose, and both father and mother petted May.  \"Will it ruin us, mother?\" inquired Annie directly, but before her mother could answer her, Annie's practical mind took a sudden flight. It went straight back to the purchases which she and Rose had been making that afternoon. They had been at \"Robinson's,\" of all places. But Tom Robinson was only to be seen in the glass office, or walking about the place in the morning, at hours which these two customers had carefully avoided. Dora's heart had quaked all the same, in dread of an event which, bad enough when it was confined to a passing bow, or a limp hand-shake and half a dozen words exchanged in the street, would have been intolerable in \"Robinson's,\" under the eyes of his satellites. Yet for the Millars to have refrained altogether from going to the one great shop in the town, where women oft did congregate, would have been to expose an event, the participators in which devoutly hoped was buried in oblivion. They had been in Miss Franklin's department without anything untoward happening; but it was neither \"Robinson's\" nor the person who served them there that flashed like lightning across Annie's thoughts at this crisis. It was the articles the girls had been buying, the Tussore silk and Torchon lace for frocks that Annie and Dora had meant to wear at a garden-party--for which the Dyers, the new people who had come to Redcross Manor-house, had sent out invitations. If the Millars were ruined, they were not likely to go to many more garden-parties, and though the sisters might still want frocks, yet frocks of Tussore silk trimmed with Torchon lace--granted that the materials had appeared a modest and becoming wear for a doctor's daughters an hour before--might not be quite an appropriate selection in the family's altered circumstances.  \"It depends upon what you call ruin,\" Mrs. Millar was saying falteringly, \"and of course the bank's assets may turn out better than is thought just now, though your father is far from hopeful. He says all his savings will go, and he may count on having to pay bank 'calls' on his income till the business is wound up, which may not be in his lifetime. No doubt he is taking the darkest view of things at present.\" Then she yielded to the relief of pouring forth some of the coming woes in detail. \"Oh, my dears, your father says, though nothing can be settled in a moment, there is one thing certain--this house must be given up.\"  \"Our house!\" cried both of the girls in dismay.  \"Where we were all born, where father himself was born,\" pleaded Dora, still hanging about her mother.  \"The Old Doctor's House--why, it seems to belong to the"]]]
