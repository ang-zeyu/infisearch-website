Marian laid the bonnet and cape carefully upon her grandmother's smooth bed and went down to tell Hepzibah that it was the teacher, who had arrived. She had not wanted to leave Miss Dorothy, in order to give the old servant this piece of information, but now that her chance had come she went straight to the kitchen.  Hepzibah was stalking about preparing supper. She looked up sharply as Marian entered. \"Well,\" she said, \"what's wanting?\"  \"It's Miss Robbins, the teacher, Heppy,\" Marian told her. \"You saw us go by down the garden, didn't you?\"  \"Why didn't she say so?\" returned Heppy in an aggrieved voice. \"How's I to know she wasn't a book-agent or a body selling home-made laces and embroidered shirt waists. She was carrying a bag and it might have been full of wares for all I knew.\"  \"But she doesn't look like a peddler.\"  \"Looks belie folks sometimes. Some of 'em is dressed as good as the best, in hats with feathers and kid gloves. She might have been that or anything, for all I could tell. I'll do just the same next time. She'd oughter have told her business right out, instead of hemming and hawing and asking was Mrs. Otway to home. That's the way they all do; get the name next door and come as brazen as you please asking for Mrs. this and that. I'd like to know who's to tell the sheep from the goats.\"  \"I would know in a minute that Miss Dorothy wasn't a goat,\" said Marian.  \"Oh, you know a heap, don't you,\" replied Heppy scornfully. \"If you knew so much why didn't you tell me who it was first off?\"  \"I didn't know exactly who it was but I could easily guess, for I knew the teacher was coming some time soon.\"  \"I don't see why your grandma didn't say I was to look out for her,\" Heppy went on with a new grievance.  \"Maybe she thought you would know, because you helped get her room ready, and knew she was expected,\" Marian made excuse.  \"As if I could remember anything on a Saturday, when I'd been pestered to death, answering the door a dozen times, while I was cleaning my kitchen. She might have chose some other day to come.\"  \"She has to begin school on Monday, and besides that would be just as bad, for it would be wash-day and you are cross always then, Heppy, you know you are.\"  Heppy turned on her. \"You just go out of here,\" she said. \"I don't want you 'round underfoot, pestering me at meal-time nohow. I guess I can get a meal for four just as easy as for three and I don't need your help neither.\"  At this Marian was fain to depart, seeing that Heppy was in one of her worst moods, when everything was a grievance. It was a pleasant contrast when the little girl was met by Miss Dorothy's smile as she returned to the parlor, so she settled herself by the side of this new friend, folded her hands and let her feet dangle over the edge of the sofa. It was rather a slippery seat and in time it might be that she would have to wriggle back to a firmer place, but its nearness to Miss Dorothy was its attraction and she felt well satisfied and entirely secure when the teacher's arm encircled her and drew her closer. \"I am to have one new pupil anyhow,\" said Miss Dorothy, smiling down. \"Won't it be nice for us to be going to school together every day, Marian?\"  \"Oh, am I going?\" Marian looked from one grandparent to another.  Mrs. Otway nodded sedately. \"We have concluded that it is best,\" she said. \"Your grandfather has many affairs to attend to, and it is a tax upon his time to teach you, therefore, since you will not need to go to school unattended, we think it best. We shall see how it works, at all events, and if it seems wise to withdraw you later, we can do so.\"  Marian gave a long sigh of satisfaction, but said nothing. She was constantly told that little children should be seen and not heard, and moreover she thought it might hurt her grandfather's feelings if she showed too much pleasure at the change. Yet when she gave the new teacher a glad smile, Miss Dorothy realized that the prospect of school was a pleasant one to at least one of her pupils.     _CHAPTER III_  _A New Road_   Instead of sitting in a straight-backed chair in her grandfather's study, conning over dry lessons while Mr. Otway wrote or read, it was quite a different experience for Marian to go to school to Miss Dorothy in a cheerful little schoolhouse where twenty other girls were seated each before her particular desk. Lessons with Grandpa Otway had been very stupid, for he required literal, word-for-word, gotten-by-heart pages, had no mercy upon faulty spelling, and frowned down mistakes in arithmetic examples. He did not make much of a point of writing, for he wrote a queer, scratchy hand himself, and so Marian could scarcely form her letters legibly, a fact of which she was made ashamed when she saw how well Ruth Deering wrote, and discovered that Marjorie Stone sent a letter every week to her brother at college.  However, the rest of it was such an improvement upon other years, that every morning Marian started out very happily, book bag on arm, and Miss Dorothy by her side. The first day was the most eventful, of course, and the child was in a quiver of excitement. Her teacher was perhaps not less nervous, though she did not show it except by the two red spots upon her cheeks. It was her first day as teacher as well as Marian's, as one of a class in school. But all passed off well, the twenty little girls with shining faces and fresh frocks were expectant and the new teacher quite came up to their hopes. Marian already knew Ruth Deering and Marjorie Stone, for they were in her Sunday-school class, and some of the others she had seen at church. Alice Evans sat with her parents just in front of the Otways' pew, so her flaxen pig-tails were a familiar sight, while Minnie Keating's big brown bow of ribbon appeared further along on Sunday mornings.  Marian felt that she did quite as well as the other girls in most things, and was beginning to congratulate herself upon knowing as much as any one of her age, when she was called to the blackboard to write out a sentence. At her feeble effort which resulted in a crooked scrawl, there was a subdued titter from the others. For one moment the new scholar stood, her cheeks flaming, then with defiant face she turned to Miss Dorothy. \"I can spell it every word,\" she said, \"if I can't write it.\"  Miss Dorothy smiled encouragingly, for she understood the situation. \"That is more than many little girls of your age can do,\" she said. \"Suppose you spell it for us, then.\"  With clenched hands Marian faced her schoolmates. \"Separate syllables, and enunciate with distinct emphasis,\" she finished triumphantly, without looking at the book.  \"That is a very good test,\" said Miss Dorothy; \"you may take your seat. Now, Alice, I will give out the next sentence, and you may spell it without the board,\" and the day was saved for Marian.  After this she triumphantly gave the boundaries of several countries, told without hesitation the dates of three important events in history, carried to a correct finish a difficult example in long division, and when the hour came for school to close she had won her place. Yet the matter of writing was uppermost in her mind as she walked home, and she said shamefacedly to Miss Dorothy, \"Isn't it dreadful for a girl of my age not to know how to write?\"  \"It isn't as if it were a thing that couldn't be learned,\" Miss Dorothy told her for her encouragement, \"but you must hurry up and conquer it. You might practice at home between times, and you will be surprised to find how you improve. Have you never written letters to your father?\"  Marian shook her head. \"Not really myself. Grandma always writes them for me,\" then she added, \"so of course she says just what she pleases; I'd like to say what I please, I think.\"  \"I am sure your father would like it better if you did. I know when my father was away from home the letter that most pleased him was written by my little sister Patty when she was younger than you.\"  \"How old is she now?\" asked Marian.  \"Just about your age. She can write very well, but you can distance her in spelling and arithmetic.\"  \"I'll catch up with her in writing,\" decided Marian, \"and maybe she will catch up with me in the other things.\"  \"I'll tell her what you say,\" said Miss Dorothy; \"that will be an incentive to you both. I should like you to know our Patty. She is our baby, and is a darling.\"  \"I should like to know her,\" returned Marian warmly.  \"I'll tell her to write to you,\" promised Miss Dorothy.  \"Oh, good! I never have letters from any one but papa, and he writes only once a year. I wish he would write oftener, for his letters are so nice, and I do love him, though I haven't seen him since I was a baby.\"  \"Perhaps if he knew you really cared so much to hear, he would write. Why don't you send him a letter and tell him?\"  \"Oh, but just see what a fist I make at writing. I will tell him as soon as I can write better, although,\" she added with a sigh, \"that seems a long time to wait.\"  Miss Dorothy was thoughtfully silent for a few minutes. \"I will tell you what,\" she said presently. \"I have a small typewriting machine which I will teach you how to use. It is very simple, and you spell so nicely that it will be no time before you could manage a perfectly legible letter to your father.\"  \"Oh, Miss Dorothy, I do love you,\" cried Marian. \"That is such a delightful idea. What an angelic sister Patty has.\"  Miss Dorothy laughed. \"What a funny little girl you are. I am glad, however, that you didn't say: How awfully nice! I am afraid that is what Patty would have said, but she hasn't had the advantage of associating with only scholarly people like your grandparents, and so she talks as her brothers and sisters do.\"  \"I should think she would be awfully happy to have so many brothers and sisters,\" remarked Marian.  \"Oh, dear, see what example does,\" exclaimed Miss Dorothy. \"You"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19988"],["title","Little Maid Marian (#4)"],["body"," awfully happy and I never heard you say awfully anything before. I'll tell you what we'll do; whenever you hear me saying awfully nice or awfully horrid you tell me, and I'll do the same by you. Is it a bargain?\"  \"Oh, yes, thank you, Miss Dorothy, but I'm afraid I should feel queer to correct you.\"  \"I am not perfect, my dear,\" said Miss Dorothy gravely, \"not any more than the rest of humanity. I shouldn't expect you to correct me ordinarily, but this is a habit I want to get out of, and that I do not want you to get into, so we shall be a mutual help, you see, and you will be doing me a favor by reminding me.\"  \"Then I'll try to do it. How shall I tell you when other people are around? It would sound queer if I said: Oh, Miss Dorothy, you said awfully.\"  \"So it would, you little wiseacre. You can touch me on the elbow and then put your finger on your lip, and I will understand, and I will do the same when you say it.\"  Marian was perfectly satisfied at this. \"I am so glad you are here,\" she sighed. \"I feel lots more faith growing. I shall soon be very--is it faithful I ought to say?\"  \"Well, not exactly in the sense you mean, though really it ought to be that faithful means full of faith; as it is it means trustworthy and devoted to the performance of duties and things. I think the old meaning when one wanted to say that a person was full of faith was faithful, but the original sense of many words has been lost.\"  \"When shall I begin with the typewriter?\" asked Marian, changing the subject.  \"We can begin this afternoon. I have unpacked and oiled it, so it is all ready to use.\"  \"How soon do you think I can send a letter to papa?\"  \"If you are industrious and painstaking I should say you could do it in a week.\"  \"Oh, that's not long, and he will get it long before Christmas, won't he?\"  \"Yes, indeed! I should think in ten days or two weeks at the furthest.\"  \"I should like to send him something for Christmas. I never did send him anything. Don't you think it would be nice to do it?\"  \"I think it would be awfully nice.\"  Marian gave her teacher's arm a gentle shake and put her finger to her lip.  Miss Dorothy looked at her a little puzzled, then she understood. \"Oh, I said awfully, didn't I? Thank you, dearie, for reminding me. What should you like to send your father?\"  \"I don't know. I'll have to think. You'll help me to think, won't you?\"  \"Indeed I will, if you want me to. I should think almost anything you could send would please him, for, after all, it is the thought that counts, not the thing itself.\"  \"Oh, but I do think things count, and--Miss Dorothy, you won't tell if I ask him not to send me money.\"  \"Not money? I think that it's rather a nice thing to have, for then you can buy whatever you like.\"  \"You couldn't if you were I.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because. You won't say anything about it to the grans?\" Marian's voice dropped to a whisper. \"When papa sends me money it always goes to the missions; it is my sacrifice, Grandma says. As long as I don't have the money really in my hands, it doesn't so much matter, but it would matter if I had to go without butter or perhaps sweet things, like dessert or cake for a whole month. That is what would happen if I said I would rather have the money myself than let the missionaries have it. Oh, I suppose it is all right,\" she added quickly, \"and no doubt I am a hardened sinner, but I would like a real Christmas gift.\"  \"Did you never have one?\" asked Miss Dorothy, with pity and surprise in her voice.  \"Not a really one, except from Mrs. Hunt; she gave me a sweet little pincushion last year, and a whole bag full of cakes and goodies. I enjoyed them very much.\"  \"Did your grandparents give you nothing at all?\"  \"Oh, yes. I had a new hat, and gloves and handkerchiefs. I was pleased to have them of course, but I would like something real Christmassy and--and--foolish.\"  \"You blessed child, of course you would,\" and Miss Dorothy mentally determined that the next Christmas should provide something real Christmassy for her little companion.  Marian was silent for a while then she asked, \"Do you have a Christmas tree at your house?\"  \"Why, yes, always, and we all hang up our stocking from father down to Patty. Don't you?\"  \"No, I never did, and I never had a tree.\"  \"Why, you poor dear child,\" exclaimed Miss Dorothy surprised out of discretion.  \"There doesn't any one know how much I want it,\" said Marian in part excuse, \"but I do. That is what I meant about moving mountains and faith. Do you believe if I had a great deal of faith, as sharp and strong as a mustard seed that the Lord would send me a tree? I never told any one before about it, but you understand better than Mrs. Hunt. I thought once or twice I would ask her, but she might laugh and I don't want any one to laugh, for it is very solemn.\" She peered anxiously up into Miss Dorothy's face to see if there were a suspicion of amusement there, but Miss Dorothy looked as grave as any one could wish.  \"I think faith can do a great deal, my dear little girl,\" she said gently.  \"It can move mountains, the Bible says. I heard grandpa and grandma talking about it, and Mrs. Hunt showed me some mustard seed. I tasted one and it was very strong, so I know now it doesn't mean the bigness but the strongness.\"  Miss Dorothy looked down with a smile. \"You little theologian,\" she exclaimed. Then to herself she said: This comes of shutting up a child with staid old people. The dear thing needs a whole lot of frivolity mixed up in her life; Christmas trees and things. She shall have them if I can do any of the mixing. \"Well, dear,\" she said aloud, \"I think we will hold on to all the faith we can muster, and see what will come of it, but you must realize that just sitting still and believing isn't all of it. We must work, too, for the Bible says faith _and_ works, not faith _or_ works. So now you work hard over your writing, and send letters to your father so he will know what his little girl likes and longs for, then you will be doing your part in that direction, and at the same time put your trust in his love for you, and no doubt something beautiful will come of it all. You can come up to my room as soon as you want to, and we will start the little typewriter.\"  Marian's satisfaction was too deep for words, but she gave her teacher's arm a little squeeze and laid her cheek against it.  It was not long before she was tapping at the door of Miss Dorothy's room, but before she began the work she was so eager for, she asked, \"Do you think I ought to ask grandma's permission?\"  \"I don't see why you need to, for there is nothing wrong about it,\" Miss Dorothy replied. \"But if you feel as if you should, you can run down and tell your grandmother what you are going to do. You can say that I am going to teach you to use my little machine, and surely she will not object.\"  But Mrs. Otway was off upon some charity bent, and Marian returned feeling that she had done her duty in making the attempt to tell. Then she and Miss Dorothy had great fun over the little machine which seemed so complicated at first, but which gradually grew more and more familiar, so that at the end of an hour under Miss Dorothy, Marian was able to write out several lines quite creditably. These she took down and proudly showed to her grandfather.  \"First-rate,\" he exclaimed. \"Keep on, my child, and after a while you will be able to copy out my papers for me; a great assistance that would be. I shouldn't wonder but in time you would make me an excellent secretary.\" Under this praise Marian's qualms of conscience were eased. If grandpa approved, that was enough. Her next impulse was to run to Mrs. Hunt's to show off her new accomplishment, but she decided to wait till she could manage the typewriter entirely alone, so would the credit be greater.  She sought out Tippy and Dippy to tell her secret to. They were her confidants always, and to-day she had almost forgotten them in the novelty of having so sympathetic a friend as Miss Dorothy. It would never do to forsake old and tried comrades, and so Tippy was roused from her nap, and Dippy was captured in the act of catching a grasshopper, then the two were borne to the end of the garden to a sheltered spot where Marian always had her \"thinks.\" She took the two in her lap. Tippy settled down at once, but Dippy had to have his head rubbed for some minutes before he began to purr contentedly.  \"You see, my dears,\" began Marian, \"I am going to have a great deal to do, almost as much as grandma has with her clubs and societies and meetings. First there is school. I think I like Alice Evans the best of the girls, for she has such pretty hair, but I am not quite sure about it. She was not quite as nice to me at recess as Ruth was, so maybe I shall like Ruth best. I am sure I shall love Patty. I wish she had come here with her sister. It must be lovely, Tippy, to have a sister, though I suppose you don't think as I do, for you had a sister once and now you don't care anything about her, for you fizzed at her the other day when she came in our garden. I saw you and heard you, too, and I was very much shocked. What was I talking about? Oh, yes, about so much to do. I'll have lessons to study at home after this, I suppose. We didn't have any real lessons to-day, just trial things, and I did such awful--I mean really awful writing on the blackboard that the girls all giggled. I just hated that, and I felt like crying or like running away and never going back, but I realized that it wouldn't do to do either, so that is another thing I must do.  \"I must practice writing at home. I wonder where I shall get paper and things to do it on. I'll have to ask Miss Dorothy about that. She is such a dear, Tippy, and she likes cats; she said so. I never used to think that any one could be as nice as Mrs. Hunt, but Miss Dorothy is nicer in some ways, for she understands just how you feel about everything, and Mrs. Hunt doesn't always. She is as"]]]
