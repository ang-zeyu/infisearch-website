It was light enough for speed, but heavy enough to break bones where it hit. A skilled man could knock a knife, or even a heavy club, out of another's hand with a single flick of the wrist. And he'd had practice.  He saw Murdoch's club dart in and take out two of the gang, one on the forward swing, one on the recover. Gordon's eyes popped at that. The man was totally unlike a Martian captain, and a knot of homesickness for Earth ran through his stomach.  He swallowed the sentiment; his own club was moving now. Standing beside Murdoch, they were moving forward. The other four cops had come in reluctantly.  \"Knock them out and kick them down!\" Murdoch yelled. \"And don't let them get away!\"  Gordon was after a thug who was attempting to run away. He brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.  It was soon over. They rounded up the men of the gang, and one of the cops started off. Murdoch called, \"Where are you going?\"  \"To find a phone and call the wagon.\"  \"We're not using wagons,\" Murdoch told him. \"Line them up.\"  When the hoods came to, they found themselves helpless, and facing police with clubs. If they tried to run, they were hit from behind; if they stood still, they were clubbed carefully. If they fought back, the pugnaciousness was knocked out of them at once.  Murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks. The captain's face was as sick as Gordon felt. \"Take him aside. Names.\"  Gordon found a section away from the others. \"I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember,\" he told the man.  Horror shot over the other's bruised features. \"Colonel, they'd kill me! I don't know.\"  His screams were almost worse than the beating but names began to come. Gordon took them down, and then returned with the man to the others.  Murdoch took his nod as evidence enough, and turned to the wretched toughs. \"He squealed,\" he announced. \"If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you. Now get out of this district, or get honest jobs! Because every time one of my men sees one of you, this will happen again. And you can pass the word along that the Stonewall gang is dead!\"  He turned and moved off down the street, the others at his side. Gordon nodded. \"I've heard the theory, but never saw it in practice. Suppose the whole gang jumps us at once?\"  Murdoch shrugged. \"Then we're taken. The old book I got the idea from didn't mention that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Trouble began brewing shortly after, though. Men stood outside, studying the cops on their beat. Murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six, and then a third. After that, the watchers began to melt away.  \"We'd better shift to another territory,\" Murdoch decided. Gordon realized that the gang had figured that concentrating the police here meant other territories would be safe.  Two more groups were given the treatment. In the third one, Bruce Gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before. He was a sick-looking spectacle.  Murdoch nodded. \"Object lesson!\"  The one good thing about the captain, Gordon decided, was that he believed in doing his own dirtiest work. When he was finished, he turned to two of the other captives.  \"Get a stretcher, and take him wherever he belongs,\" he ordered. \"I'm leaving you two able to walk for that. But if _you_ get caught again, you'll get still worse.\"  The squad went in, tired and sore; all had taken a severe beating in the brawls. But there was little grumbling. Gordon saw grudging admiration in their eyes for Murdoch, who had taken more punishment than they had.  Gordon rode back in the official car with Murdoch and both were silent most of the way. But the captain stirred finally, sighing. \"Poor devils!\"  Gordon jerked up in surprise. \"The gang?\"  \"No, the cops they're giving me. We're covered, Gordon. But the Stonewall gang is backing Wayne. He's let me come in because he figures it will get him more votes. But afterwards, he'll have me out; and then the boys with me will be marks for the gang when it comes back. Besides, it'll show on the books that they didn't kick into his fund. I can always go back to Earth, and I'll try to take you along. But it's going to be tough on them.\"  Bruce Gordon grimaced. \"I've got a yellow ticket, from Security.\"  Murdoch blinked. He dropped his eyes slowly. \"So you're _that_ Gordon? But you're still a good cop.\"  They rode on further in silence, until Gordon broke the ice to ease the tension. He found himself liking the other.  \"What makes you think Wayne will be re-elected? Nobody wants him, except a gang of crooks and those in power.\"  Murdoch grinned bitterly. \"Ever see a Martian election? No, you're a firster. He can't lose! And then hell is going to pop, and this whole planet may be blown wide open!\"  It fitted with the dire predictions of Security, and with the spying Gordon was going to do--according to them.  He discussed it with Mother Corey, who agreed that Wayne would be re-elected.  \"Can't lose,\" the old man said. He was getting even fatter, now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner.  \"He'll win,\" Mother Corey repeated. \"And you'll turn honest all over, now you're in uniform. Take me, cobber. I figured on laying low for a while, then opening up a few rooms for a good pusher or two, maybe a high-class duchess. Cost 'em more, but they'd be respectable. Only now I'm respectable myself, they don't look so good. But this honesty stuff, it's like dope. You start out on a little, and you have to go all the way.\"  \"It didn't affect Honest Izzy,\" Gordon pointed out.  \"Nope. Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it. But you got Earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once. Too bad.\" He sighed ponderously.         *       *       *       *       *  The week moved on. The groups grew more experienced, and Murdoch was training a new squad every night. Gordon's own squad was equipped with shields now, and they were doing better. The number of muggings and holdups in the section was going down. They seldom saw a man after he'd been treated.  One of the squads was jumped by a gang of about forty, and two of the men were killed before the nearest other squad could pull a rear attack. That day the whole force worked overtime hunting for the men who had escaped; and by evening the Stonewall boys had received proof that it didn't pay to go against the police in large numbers.  After that, they began to go hunting for the members of the gang. They had the names of nearly all of them, and some pretty good ideas of their hide-outs.  It wasn't exactly legal; but nothing was, here. If a doctor's job was to prevent illness, instead of merely curing it, then why shouldn't it be a policeman's job to prevent crime? Here, that was best done by wiping out the Stonewall gang to the last member.  This could lead to abuses, as he'd seen on Earth. But there probably wouldn't be time for it if Mayor Wayne was re-elected.  The gang had begun to break up, but the nucleus would be the last to go. The police had orders to beat any member on sight, now. Citizens were appearing on the streets at night for the first time in years. And there were smiles--hungry, beaten smiles, but still genuine ones--for the cops.     Chapter V  RECALL   It was night outside, and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly, giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house. Bruce Gordon reached the outskirts of the miserable business section, noticing that a couple of the shops were still open. It had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down. And the slow, doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that Haley's system was working. Gordon nodded to a couple, and they grinned faintly at him. Damn it, Mars could be cleaned up....  He grinned at himself, then something needled at his mind, until he swung back. The man who had just passed was carrying a lunch basket, and was wearing the coveralls of one of the crop-prospector crews; but the expression on his face had been wrong.  Red hair, too heavily built, a lighter section where a mustache had been shaved and the skin not quite perfectly powdered.... Gordon moved forward quickly, until he could make out the thin scar showing through the make-up over the man's eyes. He'd been right--this was O'Neill, head of the Stonewall gang.  Gordon hit the signal switch, and the Marspeaker let out a shrill whistle. O'Neill had turned to run, and then seemed to think better of it. His hand darted down to his belt, just as Gordon reached him.  The heavy locust stick met the man's wrist before the weapon was half drawn--another gun! Guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere. The gun dropped from O'Neill's hand as the wrist snapped, and the Stonewall chief let out a high-pitched cry of pain. Then another cop came around a corner at a run.  \"You can't do it to me! I'm reformed; I'm going straight! You damned cops can't....\" O'Neill was blubbering. The small crowd that was collecting was all to the good, Gordon knew, and he let O'Neill go on. Nothing could help break up the gangs more than having a leader break down in public.  The other cop had yanked out O'Neill's wallet, and now tossed it to Gordon. One look was enough--the work papers had the telltale over-thickening of the signature that had showed up on other papers, obviously forgeries. The cops had been passing them on the hope of finding one of the leaders.  Some turned away as Gordon and the other cop went to work, but most of them weren't squeamish. When it was over, the two picked up their whimpering captive. Gordon pocketed the revolver with his free hand. \"Walk, O'Neill!\" he ordered. \"Your legs are still whole. Use them!\"  The man staggered between them, whimpering at each step."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20212"],["title","Police Your Planet (#6)"],["body","any members of the gang were around, they made no attempt to rescue him.  Jenkins, the other cop, had been holding the wallet. Now he held it out toward Gordon. \"The gee was heeled, Corporal. Must of been making a big contact in something. Fifty-fifty?\"  \"Turn it in to Murdoch,\" Gordon said, and then cursed himself. There must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet.         *       *       *       *       *  The captain's face had been buried in a pile of papers, but now Murdoch came around to stare at the gang leader. He inspected the forged work papers, and jerked his thumb toward one of the hastily built cells where a doctor would look O'Neill over--eventually. When Gordon and Jenkins came back, Murdoch tossed the money to them. \"Split it. You guys earned it by keeping your hands off it. Anyhow, you're as entitled to it as he was--or the grafters back at Police Headquarters. I never saw it. Gordon, you've got a visitor!\"  His voice was bitter, but he made no opening for them to question him as he picked up the papers and began going through them again. Gordon went down the passage to the end of the hall, in the direction Murdoch had indicated. Waiting for him was the lean, cynical little figure of Honest Izzy, complete with uniform and sergeant's stripes.  \"Hi, gov'nor,\" the little man greeted him. \"Long time no see. With you out here and me busy nights doing a bit of convoy work on the side, we might as well not both live at Mother's.\"  Bruce Gordon nodded, grinning in spite of himself. \"Convoy duty, Izzy? Or dope running?\"  \"Whatever comes to hand, gov'nor. The Force pays for my time during the day, and I figure my time's my own at night. Of course, if I ever catch myself doing anything shady during the day, I'll have to turn myself in. But it ain't likely.\" He grinned in satisfaction. \"Now that I've dug up the scratch to buy these stripes and get made sergeant--and that takes the real crackle--I'm figuring on taking it easy.\"  \"Like this social call?\" Gordon asked him.  The little man shook his head, his ancient eighteen-year-old face turning sober. \"Nope. I've been meaning to see you, so I volunteered to run out some red tape for your captain. You owe me some bills, gov'nor. Eleven hundred fifty credits. You didn't pay up your pledge to the campaign fund, so I hadda fill in. A thousand, interest at ten per cent a week, standard. Right?\"  Gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here, but he shook his head. \"Wrong, Izzy. If they want to collect that dratted pledge of theirs, let them put me where I can make it. There's no graft out here.\"  \"Huh?\" Izzy turned it over, and shook his head. Finally he shrugged. \"Don't matter, gov'nor. Nothing about that in the pledge, and when you sign something, you gotta pay it. You _gotta_.\"  \"All right,\" Gordon admitted. He was suddenly in no mood to quibble with Izzy's personal code. \"So you paid it. Now show me where I signed any agreement saying I'd pay _you_ back!\"  For a second, Izzy's face went blank; then he chuckled. \"Jet me! You're right, gov'nor. I sure asked for that one. Okay; I'm bloody well suckered, so forget it.\"  Gordon shrugged and gave up. He pulled out the bills and handed them over. \"Thanks, Izzy.\"  \"Thanks, yourself.\" The kid pocketed the money cheerfully, nodding. \"Buy you a beer. Anyhow, you won't miss it. I came out to tell you I got the sweetest beat in Marsport--over a dozen gambling joints on it--and I need a right gee to work it with me. So you're it!\"  For a moment, Gordon wondered what Izzy had done to earn that beat, but he could guess. The little guy knew Mars as few others did, apparently, from all sides. And if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own, Izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out, and use the information. With a beat such as that, even going halves, and with all the graft to the upper brackets, he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months.  But he shook his head. \"I'm assigned here, Izzy, at least for another week, until after elections....\"  \"Better take him up, Gordon,\" Murdoch told him bitterly. The captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench. \"Go on, accept, damn it. You're not assigned here any more. None of us are. Mayor Wayne found an old clause in the charter and got a rigged decision, pulling me back under his full authority. I thought I had full responsibility to Earth, but he's got me. Wearing their uniform makes me a temporary citizen! So we're being smothered back into the Force, and they'll have their patsies out here, setting things up for the Stonewall boys to come back by election time. So grab while the grabbing's good, because by tomorrow morning I'll have this all closed down!\"  He shook off Gordon's hand and stood up roughly, to head back up the hallway. Then he stopped and looked back. \"One thing, though, I've still got enough authority to make you a sergeant. It's been a pleasure working with you, Sergeant Gordon!\"  He swung out of view abruptly, leaving Gordon with a heavy weight in his stomach. Izzy whistled, and began picking up his helmet, preparing to go outside. \"So that's the dope I brought out, eh? Takes it kind of hard, doesn't he?\"  \"Yeah,\" Gordon answered. There was no use trying to explain it to Izzy. \"Yeah, we do. Come on.\"  Outside, Gordon saw other cops moving from house to house, and he realized that Murdoch must be sending out warnings to the citizens that things would soon be rough again.  Izzy held out a hand to Gordon. \"Let's get a beer, gov'nor--on me!\"  It was as good an idea as any he had, Gordon decided. He might as well enjoy what life he still had while he could. The Stonewall gang--what was left of it--and all its friends would be gunning for him now. The Force wouldn't have been fooled when Izzy paid his pledge, and they'd mark him down as disloyal--if they didn't automatically mark down all who'd served under Murdoch. And he didn't have the ghost of an idea as to what Security wanted of him, or where they were hiding themselves.  \"Make it two beers, Izzy,\" he said. \"Needled!\"     Chapter VI  SEALED LETTER   In the few days at the short-lived Nineteenth Precinct, Bruce Gordon had begun to feel like a cop again, but the feeling disappeared as he reported in at Captain Isaiah Trench's Seventh Precinct. Trench had once been a colonel in the Marines, before a court-martial and sundry unpleasantnesses had driven him off Earth. His dark, scowling face and lean body still bore a military air.  He looked Bruce Gordon over sourly. \"I've been reading your record. It stinks. Making trouble for Jurgens--could have been charged as false arrest. No co-operation with your captain until he forced it; out in the sticks beating up helpless men. Now you come crawling back to your only friend, Isaacs. Well, I'll give it a try. But step out of line and I'll have you cleaning streets with your bare hands. All right, _Corporal_ Gordon. Dismissed. Get to your beat.\"  Gordon grinned wryly at the emphasis on his title. No need to ask what had happened to Murdoch's recommendation. He joined Izzy in the locker room, summing up the situation.  \"Yeah.\" Izzy looked worried, his thin face pinched in. \"Maybe I didn't do you a favor, gov'nor, pulling you here. I dunno. I got some pics of Trench from a guy I know. That's how I got my beat so fast in the Seventh. But Trench ain't married, and I guess I've used up the touch. Maybe I could try it, though.\"  \"Forget it,\" Gordon told him. \"I'll work it out somehow.\"  The beat was a gold mine. It lay through the section where Gordon had first tried his luck on Mars. There were a dozen or so gambling joints, half a dozen cheap saloons, and a fair number of places listed as rooming houses, though they made no bones about the fact that all their permanent inhabitants were female. Then the beat swung off, past a row of small businesses and genuine rooming houses, before turning back to the main section.  They began in the poorer section. It wasn't the day to collect the \"tips\" for good service, which had been an honest attempt to promote good police service before it became a racket. But they were met everywhere by sullen faces. Izzy explained it. The city had passed a new poll tax--to pay for election booths, supposedly--and had made the police collect it. Murdoch must have disregarded the order, but the rest of the force had been busy helping the administration.  But once they hit the main stem, things were mere routine. The gambling joints took it for granted that beat cops had to be paid, and considered it part of their operating expense. The only problem was that Fats' Place was the first one on the list. Gordon didn't expect to be too welcome there.  There was no sign of the thug, but Fats came out of his back office just as Gordon reached the little bar. He came over, nodded, picked up a cup and dice and began shaking them.  \"High man for sixty,\" he said automatically, and expertly rolled bull's-eyes for a two. \"Izzy said you'd be around. Sorry my man drew that _knife_ on you the last time, Corporal.\"  Gordon rolled an eight, pocketed the bills, and shrugged. \"Accidents will happen, Fats.\"  \"Yeah.\" The other picked up the dice and began rolling sevens absently. \"How come you're walking beat, anyhow? With what you pulled here, you should have bought a captaincy.\"  Gordon told him briefly. The man chuckled grimly. \"Well, that's Mars,\" he said, and turned back to his private quarters.  Mostly, it was routine work. They came on a drunk later, collapsed in an alley. But the muggers had apparently given up before Izzy and Gordon arrived, since the man had his wallet clutched in his hand. Gordon reached for it, twisting his lips.  Izzy stopped him. \"It ain't honest, gov'nor. If the gees in the wagon clean him, or the desk man gets it, that's their business. But I'm going to run a straight beat, or else!\"  That was followed by a call to remove a berserk spaceman"]]]
