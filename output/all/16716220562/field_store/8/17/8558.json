When Herbert would have remonstrated against these arrangements, she reminded him that they were intended to accomplish her own wishes no less than his. He ceased to remonstrate, but he did what was better--he acted--and the very first year, by self-denying economy and industry, he was enabled to return to her fifty dollars of the amount she had allotted to him. The second year he did better, and the third year Mrs. Latimer was able to return to the city and board at the same house with her son. It was only by the joy she expressed at their re-union that Herbert learned how painful the separation had been to her. She would not waste his strength and her own in vain lamentation over a necessary evil. Four years sufficed to prepare Herbert Latimer for his profession, and through the influence of some of his mother's early friends, exerted at her earnest request, the legislative act which permitted his entrance on its duties, was passed. The knowledge of his circumstances had excited a warm interest for him in many minds, and they who heard his name for the first time, when he stood before them for examination, could not but feel prepossessed in favor of the youth, on whose bold brow deep and lofty thoughts had left their impress, and in whose grave, earnest eyes the spirit seer might have read the history of a life of endurance and silent struggle. All were interested in him--all evinced that interest by gentle courtesy of manner--and almost all seemed desirous to make his examination as light as possible--all save one--one usually as remarkable for his indulgence to young aspirants, as for the legal acumen and extensive knowledge, which had won for him a large share of the profits and honors of his profession. His associates now wondered to find him so rigidly exact in his trial of young Latimer's acquirements.  \"You were very severe on our young tyro to-day,\" said a brother lawyer, and one on whom early associations and similarity of pursuits, rather than of tastes, had conferred the privileges of a friend on Mr. Cavendish, as they walked together from the court-house.  \"I saw that he did not need indulgence, and I gave him an opportunity of proving to others that he did not--but I had another and more selfish reason for my rigid test of his powers.\"  Mr. Cavendish spoke smilingly, and his friend was emboldened to ask--\"And pray what selfish motive could you have for it!\"  \"I wished to see whether he would suit me as a partner.\"  \"A partner!\"  \"Yes--when a man has lived for half a century, he begins to think that he may possibly grow old some day, and I would provide myself with a young partner, who may take the laboring oar in my business when age compels me to lay it aside.\"  \"All that may do very well--I have some thought of doing the same myself; but I shall look out for a young man who is well connected. Connections do a great deal for us, you know, and we must always have an eye to the main chance.\"  \"I agree with you, but we should probably differ about what constitutes the main chance.\"  \"There surely can be no difference about that; it means with every one the one thing needful.\"  \"And what is, in your opinion, the one thing needful?\"  \"Why this, to be sure,\" and Mr. Duffield drew his purse from his pocket, and shook it playfully.  \"A somewhat different use of the term from that which the Bible makes,\" said Mr. Cavendish.  \"Oh! let the Bible alone, and let me hear what you think of it.\"  \"Pardon me, I cannot let the Bible alone if I tell you my own opinions, for from the Bible I learned them.\"  \"It seems a strange book, I must say, to consult for a law of partnerships.\"  \"Had you a better acquaintance with it, Duffield, you would learn that its principles apply to all the relations of life. The difference between us is, that when you estimate man's chief object, or as you call it, his 'main chance,' you take only the present into view, you leave out of sight altogether the interminable future, with its higher hopes and deeper interests, and relations of immeasurably greater importance.\"  \"I find it enough for one poor brain to calculate for the present.\"  \"A great deal too much you will find it, if you leave out of your sum so important an item as the relations of that present to the future. Depend on it, Duffield, that he makes the most for this life, as well as for the next, of his time, his talents, and his wealth, who uses them as God's steward, for the happiness of his fellow-creatures, as well as for his own.\"  \"And so, for the happiness of your fellow-creatures, you are going to give away half of the best practice in the State?\"  \"I am going to do no such thing. In the first place, I did not tell you that I was going to offer young Latimer an equal division of the profits of my practice; and for what I may offer him I have already taken care to ascertain that he can return a full equivalent. His talents need only a vantage-ground on which to act, and I rejoice to be able to give him that which my own early experience taught me to value.\"  \"Well--we shall see ten years hence how your rule and mine work. I think I shall offer a partnership to young Conway--he is already rising in his profession, and is connected with some of our wealthiest families.\"  \"Very well--we shall see.\"  Herbert Latimer had nerved himself to endure five, or it might be ten more years of profitless toil, ere he should gain a position which would make his talents available for more than the mere essentials of existence. Let those who have looked on so dreary a prospect--who have buckled on their armor for such a combat--judge of the grateful emotion with which he received the generous proposal of Mr. Cavendish. This proposal, while it gave him at once an opportunity for the exercise of his powers, secured to him for the first year one-fifth, for the two following years one-fourth, and after that, if neither partner chose to withdraw from the connection, one-half of the profits of a business, the receipts of which had for several years averaged over ten thousand dollars. Mr. Cavendish soon found that he had done well to trust to the gratitude of his young partner for inducing the most active exercise of his powers. Stimulated by the desire to prove himself not unworthy of such kindness, and to secure his generous friend from any loss, Herbert never overlooked aught that could advance the interests, nor grew weary of any task that could lighten the toil of Mr. Cavendish.  \"Herbert, you really make me ashamed of myself, you are so constantly busy that I seem idle in comparison,\" said Mr. Cavendish, as he prepared one day to lay by his papers and leave the office at three o'clock. \"Pray put away those musty books, and bring Mrs. Latimer to dine with us--this is a fÃªte day with us. My daughter, who has been for two months with her uncle and aunt in Washington, has returned, and I want to introduce her to Mrs. Latimer.\"  \"My mother will come to you with pleasure, I am sure.\"  \"And you?\"  \"Will come too, if I possibly can. You dine at five?\"  \"Yes--and remember punctuality is the soul of dinner as well as of business. So do not let the charms of Coke upon Lyttleton make you forget that fair ladies and hungry gentlemen are expecting you.\" Mr. Cavendish closed the door with a smiling face, and Herbert Latimer turned for another hour to his books and papers. At a quarter before five he stood with his mother in the drawing-room of Mr. Cavendish, and received his first introduction to one who soon became the star of his life.  Mary Cavendish was not beautiful--far less could the word pretty have been applied to her--but she was lovely. All that we most love in woman, all pure and peaceful thoughts, all sweet and gentle affections, seemed to beam from her eyes, or to sit throned upon her fair and open brow. She had enjoyed all the advantages, as it is termed, of a fashionable education, but the influences of her home had been more powerful than those of her school, and she remained what nature had made her--a warm-hearted, truthful, generous, and gentle girl--too ingenuous for the pretty affectations, too generous for the heartless coquetries which too often teach us that the _accomplished_ young lady has sacrificed, for her external refinement, qualities of a nobler stamp and more delicate beauty. The only daughter among several children, she was an idol in her home, and every movement of her life seemed impelled by the desire to repay the wealth of affection that was lavished upon her. It was impossible to see such a being daily in the intimacy of her home associations--the sphere in which her gentle spirit shone most brightly--without loving her; and Herbert soon felt that he loved her, yet he added in his thoughts \"in all honor,\" and to him it would have seemed little honorable to attempt to win this priceless treasure from him to whose generosity he had owed his place in her circle. Mrs. Latimer, though she did not fear for her son's honor, trembled for his future peace as she marked the sadness which often stole over him, after spending an hour in the society of this lovely girl; but Mrs. Latimer was a wise woman--she knew that speech is to such emotions often as the lighted match to a magazine, and she kept silence.  For almost a year after his introduction, Herbert continued in daily intercourse with Mary Cavendish to drink fresh draughts of love, yet so carefully did he guard his manner, that no suspicion of his warmer emotions threw a shadow over her friendship, or checked the frankness with which she unveiled to him the rich treasures of her mind and heart. It was in the autumn succeeding their first acquaintance that Mr. and Mrs. Cavendish issued cards for a large party at their house. It would be too gay a scene for the quiet taste of Mrs. Latimer, but Herbert would be there, and at the request of Mrs. Cavendish he promised to come early. The promise was kept. He arrived half an hour at least before any other"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20018"],["title","Evenings at Donaldson Manor; Or, The Christmas Guest (#4)"],["body","t, bringing with him a bouquet of rare and beautiful flowers for Mary. As he entered the hall he heard a slight scream from the parlor beside whose open door he stood. The scream was in a voice to whose lightest tone his heart responded, and in an instant, he was beside Mary Cavendish, had clasped her in his arms, and pressing her closely to his person, was endeavoring to extinguish with his hands the flames that enveloped her. The evening was cold: there was a fire in the stove, before which Mary stood arranging some flowers on the mantel-piece, when the door was opened for him. The sudden rush of air had wafted her light, floating drapery of gauze and lace into the fire, and in a moment all was in a blaze. Fortunate was it for her, that under this light, flimsy drapery, was worn a dress of stouter texture and less combustible material--a rich satin. After the slight scream which had brought him to her side, Mary uttered no sound, and with his whole soul concentrated on action, he had been equally silent till the last spark was smothered. Then gazing wildly in her pallid face he exclaimed, \"In mercy speak to me! Did I come too late? Are you burned?\"  \"I scarcely know--I think not,\" she faltered out. Then, as she made an effort to withdraw from his arms, added quickly--\"no--not at all.\"  Completely overpowered by the revulsion of feeling which those words occasioned, Herbert clasped her again in his arms, and fervently ejaculating, \"Thank God!\" pressed his lips to her cheek. At that moment, the voice of Mr. Cavendish was heard in the next room, and breaking from him, Mary rushed to her astonished father, and burying her face in his bosom, burst into tears. Aroused to full consciousness by the presence of another, Herbert stood trembling and dismayed at the remembrance of his own rashness. Agitated as she was, Mary was compelled to answer her father's questions, for he seemed wholly unable to speak.  \"Latimer, I owe my child's life probably to you. How shall I repay the debt?\" cried Mr. Cavendish, attempting, as he spoke, to clasp Herbert's hand. He winced at the touch, and a sudden contraction passed over his face.  \"You are burned,\" said Mr. Cavendish, and would have examined his hand, but throwing his handkerchief over it, Herbert declared it was not worth mentioning, though at the same time he confessed that the pain was sufficient to make him desirous to return home, and have some soothing application made to it. Mr. Cavendish parted from him with regret, with earnest charges that he should take care of himself, and equally earnest hopes that he might be sufficiently relieved to return to them before the evening was passed; but Mary still lay in her father's arms, with her face hidden, and noticed Herbert's departure neither by word nor look.  \"I have outraged her delicacy, and she cannot bear even to see me,\" he said to himself.  In passing out he accidentally trod on the flowers which he had selected with such care--\"Crushed like my own heart!\" he ejaculated mentally.  A fortnight passed before Herbert Latimer could take his accustomed place in the office of Mr. Cavendish. His hand had been deeply burned--so deeply that the pain had produced fever. During this period of suffering, Mr. Cavendish had often visited him, and Mrs. Cavendish had more than once taken his mother's place at his bedside; but Herbert found little pleasure in their attentions, for he said to himself, \"If they knew all my presumption, they would be less kind.\"  His illness passed away, his hand healed, and he resumed his accustomed avocations; but no invitation, however urgent, could win him again to the house of Mr. Cavendish. \"I have proved my own weakness--I will not place myself again in the way of temptation,\" was the language of his heart. Apologies became awkward. He felt that he must seem to his friend ungracious if not ungrateful; and one day observing unusual seriousness in the countenance of Mr. Cavendish on his declining an invitation to dine with him, he exclaimed, \"You look displeased, and I can hardly wonder at it; but could you know my reason for denying myself the pleasure of visiting you, I am sure you would think me right.\"  \"Perhaps so; but as I do not know it, you cannot be surprised that your determined withdrawal from our circle should wound both my feelings and those of my family.\"  Herbert covered his eyes with his hand for a moment, and then turning them with a grave and even sad expression on Mr. Cavendish, said, \"I have declined your invitations only because I could not accept them with honor: I love your daughter--I have loved her almost from the first hour of my acquaintance with her.\"  \"And why have you not told me so before, Herbert?\" asked Mr. Cavendish, with no anger in his tones.  \"Because I believed myself capable of loving in silence, and while I wronged no one, I was willing to indulge in the sweet poison of her society; but a moment of danger to her destroyed my self-control. What has been may be again--I have learned to distrust myself--I cannot tamper with temptation, lest I should one day use the position in which you have placed me, and the advantages which you have bestowed on me, in endeavoring to win from you a treasure which you may well be reluctant to yield to me.\"  \"Herbert, I only blame you for not having spoken to me sooner of this.\"  \"I feel now that I should have done so--it was a want of self-knowledge, the rash confidence of one untried which kept me silent.\"  \"No, Herbert--it was a want of knowledge of me--of confidence in my justice--I will not say my kindness. What higher views do you suppose I can entertain for my daughter, than to make her the wife of one who has a prospect of obtaining the most distinguished eminence in my own profession.\"  \"If that prospect be mine, to you I owe it--could I make it a plea for asking more?\"  \"You owe what I did for you to the interest and esteem excited by your own qualities, and all I did has only given you a place for the exercise of those qualities--I do not know how you will win Mary's forgiveness for refraining from her society on such slight grounds.\"  \"Dare I hope for your permission to seek that forgiveness?\"  \"Dare I hope for your company to dinner to-day?\"  \"Now that you know all, nothing could give so much pleasure--though I fear----\"  \"What, fearing again!\"  \"I fear that Miss Cavendish is very much displeased with me.\"  \"For saving her life?\"  \"No--not exactly that.\"  Herbert Latimer did not confide the cause of his fear to Mr. Cavendish, neither did he suffer it to interfere with his visit on that day. He went to dinner, but stayed to tea, and long after, and as Mary was his companion for much, if not all of this time, we presume that her displeasure could not have been manifested in any very serious manner.  It was about six weeks after this renewal of his visits that Mr. Duffield meeting his friend Mr. Cavendish one morning, accosted him with, \"I hear that your daughter is going to be married to young Latimer--is it true?\"  \"Yes, and I heartily wish the affair were over, for I hope Herbert will recover his senses when he is actually married, as now I am obliged to attend to his business and my own too.\"  \"Not much profit in that, I should think--I manage somewhat differently.\"  \"Did you not tell me that you intended forming a partnership with young Conway?\"  \"Yes--but before I had done so, I heard that Sprague, who is as well connected as Conway, and a great deal more industrious, would go into business with me on less exacting terms. He has been associated with me for some time. He does all the drudgery of the business, and is content with one-eighth of the profits for five years.\"  \"Those are low terms--with talent and connection too, I should think he could have done better.\"  \"Why, you see his connections were of little use to him while he was alone, for he was so desperately poor that they did not like to acknowledge him, but I knew as soon as he began to rise they would all notice him, and so it has proved. I have no doubt I shall gain through them more than the thousand dollars a-year which Sprague will draw, while I shall be saved every thing that is really disagreeable or laborious in my practice; and you give two thousand dollars a-year, and are to have your daughter married to a gentleman who leaves all the business on your hands--which of us, do you think, has attended most successfully to the main chance?\"  \"According to my views of the main chance, it is not to be determined by such data--but even in your own view we may have a very different account to render nine years hence?\"  \"Ah, well! Ten years from the day that Latimer passed we will compare notes.\"  Ten years are long in prospective, but it seemed to both parties only a short time when the appointed anniversary came. On that day Mr. Cavendish invited several of his brother lawyers, and amongst them Mr. Duffield, to dinner. Herbert Latimer, his wife and mother, his two noble boys, and though last, not least in importance, if in size, his little girl, her grandfather's especial pet, were of the party. It was a well assorted party. The guests found good cheer and social converse--the cherished friends of the house, food for deeper and higher enjoyment When the ladies had withdrawn, calling Herbert Latimer to the head of the table, Mr. Cavendish seated himself beside Mr. Duffield.  \"Well, Duffield!\" he exclaimed, \"do you know that it is ten years to-day since Herbert Latimer stood before us for examination?\"  \"Ah!\" ejaculated Mr. Duffield, in the tone of one who did not care to pursue the subject further.  \"You remember our agreement--are you still willing to make our success in that time a test of the truth of our respective principles?\"  \"It may afford a more conclusive proof of your better judgment in the selection of an associate.\"  \"Sprague stands very high in his profession.\"  \"Yes--I knew he would, for he has talent and connection--therefore I"]]]
