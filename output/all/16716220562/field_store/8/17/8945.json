ABIETACEÆ.  LARIX. PINUS. PICEA. TSUGA. ABIES.  Buds scaly; leaves evergreen and persistent for several years (except in _Larix_), scattered along the twigs, spirally arranged or tufted, linear, needle-shaped, or scale-like; sterile and fertile flowers separate upon the same plant; stamens (subtended by scales) spirally arranged upon a central axis, each bearing two pollen-sacs surmounted by a broad-toothed connective; fertile flowers composed of spirally arranged bracts or cover-scales, each bract subtending an ovuliferous scale; cover-scale and ovuliferous scale attached at their bases; cover-scale usually remaining small, ovuliferous scale enlarging, especially after fertilization, gradually becoming woody or leathery and bearing two ovules at its base; cones maturing (except in _Pinus_) the first year; ovuliferous scales in fruit usually known as cone-scales; seeds winged; roots mostly spreading horizontally at a short distance below the surface.   CUPRESSACEÆ.  THUJA. CUPRESSUS. JUNIPERUS.  Leaf-buds not scaly; leaves evergreen and persistent for several years, opposite, verticillate, or sometimes scattered, scale-like, often needle-shaped in seedlings and sometimes upon the branches of older plants; flowers minute; stamens and pistils in separate blossoms upon the same plant or upon different plants; stamens usually bearing 3-5 pollen-sacs on the underside; scales of fertile aments few, opposite or ternate; fruit small cones, or berries formed by coalescence of the fleshy cone-scales; otherwise as in _Abietaceæ_.   Larix Americana, Michx.  _Larix laricina, Koch._  TAMARACK. HACMATACK. LARCH. JUNIPER.  =Habitat and Range.=--Low lands, shaded hillsides, borders of ponds; in New England preferring cold swamps; sometimes far up mountain slopes.       Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, west to the Rocky      mountains; from the Rockies through British Columbia, northward      along the Yukon and Mackenzie systems, to the limit of tree growth      beyond the Arctic circle.  Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,--abundant, filling swamps acres in extent, alone or associated with other trees, mostly black spruce; growing depressed and scattered on Katahdin at an altitude of 4000 feet; Massachusetts,--rather common, at least northward; Rhode Island,--not reported; Connecticut,--occasional in the northern half of the state; reported as far south as Danbury (Fairfield county).       South along the mountains to New Jersey and Pennsylvania; west to      Minnesota.  =Habit.=--The only New England conifer that drops its leaves in the fall; a tree 30-70 feet high, reduced at great elevations to a height of 1-2 feet, or to a shrub; trunk 1-3 feet in diameter, straight, slender; branches very irregular or in indistinct whorls, for the most part nearly horizontal; often ending in long spire-like shoots; branchlets numerous, head conical, symmetrical while the tree is young, especially when growing in open swamps; when old extremely variable, occasionally with contorted or drooping limbs; foliage pale green, turning to a dull yellow in autumn.  =Bark.=--Bark of trunk reddish or grayish brown, separating at the surface into small roundish scales in old trees, in young trees smooth; season's shoots gray or light brown in autumn.  =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, globular, reddish.  Leaves simple, scattered along the season's shoots, clustered on the short, thick dwarf branches, about an inch long, pale green, needle-shaped; apex obtuse; sessile.  =Inflorescence.=--March to April. Flowers lateral, solitary, erect; the sterile from leafless, the fertile from leafy dwarf branches; sterile roundish, sessile; anthers yellow: fertile oblong, short-stalked; bracts crimson or red.  =Fruit.=--Cones upon dwarf branches, erect or inclining upwards, ovoid to cylindrical, 1/2-3/4 of an inch long, purplish or reddish brown while growing, light brown at maturity, persistent for at least a year; scales thin, obtuse to truncate; edge entire, minutely toothed or erose; seeds small, winged.  =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; grows in any good soil, preferring moist locations; the formal outline of the young trees becomes broken, irregular, and picturesque with age, making the mature tree much more attractive than the European species common to cultivation. Rarely for sale in nurseries, but obtainable from collectors. To be successfully transplanted, it must be handled when dormant. Propagated from seed.       =Note.=--The European species, with which the mature plant is often      confused, has somewhat longer leaves and larger cones; a form      common in cultivation has long, pendulous branches.

The leaves are of two kinds, primary and secondary; the primary are thin, deciduous scales, in the axils of which the secondary leaf-buds stand; the inner scales of those leaf-buds form a loose, deciduous sheath which encloses the secondary or foliage leaves, which in our species are all minutely serrulate.   Pinus Strobus, L.  WHITE PINE.  =Habitat and Range.=--In fertile soils; moist woodlands or dry uplands.       Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, through Quebec and Ontario, to Lake      Winnipeg.  New England,--common, from the vicinity of the seacoast to altitudes of 2500 feet, forming extensive forests.       South along the mountains to Georgia, ascending to 2500 feet in the      Adirondacks and to 4300 in North Carolina; west to Minnesota and      Iowa.  =Habit.=--The tallest tree and the stateliest conifer of the New England forest, ordinarily from 50 to 80 feet high and 2-4 feet in diameter at the ground, but in northern New England, where patches of the primeval forest still remain, attaining a diameter of 3-7 feet and a height ranging from 100 to 150 feet, rising in sombre majesty far above its deciduous neighbors; trunk straight, tapering very gradually; branches nearly horizontal, wide-spreading, in young trees in whorls usually of five, the whorls becoming more or less indistinct in old trees; branchlets and season's shoots slender; head cone-shaped, broad at the base, clothed with soft, delicate, bluish-green foliage; roots running horizontally near the surface, taking firm hold in rocky situations, extremely durable when exposed.  =Bark.=--On trunks of old trees thick, shallow-channeled, broad-ridged; on stems of young trees and upon branches smooth, greenish; season's shoots at first rusty-scurfy or puberulent, in late autumn becoming smooth and light russet brown.  =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leading branch-buds 1/4-1/2 inch long, oblong or ovate-oblong, sharp-pointed; scales yellowish-brown.  Foliage leaves in clusters of five, slender, 3-5 inches long, soft bluish-green, needle-shaped, 3-sided, mucronate, each with a single fibrovascular bundle, sessile.  =Inflorescence.=--June. Sterile flowers at the base of the season's shoots, in clusters, each flower about one inch long, oval, light brown; stamens numerous; connectives scale-like: fertile flowers near the terminal bud of the season's shoots, long-stalked, cylindrical; scales pink-margined.  =Fruit.=--Cones, 4-6 inches long, short-stalked, narrow-cylindrical, often curved, finally pendent, green, maturing the second year; scales rather loose, scarcely thickened at the apex, not spiny; seeds winged, smooth.  =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; free from disease; grows well in almost any soil, but prefers a light fertile loam; in open ground retains its lower branches for many years. Good plants, grown from seed, are usually readily obtainable in nurseries; small collected plants from open ground can be moved in sods with little risk.  Several horticultural forms are occasionally cultivated which are distinguished by variations in foliage, trailing branches, dense and rounded heads, and dwarfed or cylindrical habits of growth.

HARD PINE.  =Habitat and Range.=--Most common in dry, sterile soils, occasional in swamps.       New Brunswick to Lake Ontario.  Maine,--mostly in the southwestern section near the seacoast; as far north as Chesterville, Franklin county (C. H. Knowlton, _Rhodora_, II, 124); scarcely more than a shrub near its northern limits; New Hampshire,--most common along the Merrimac valley to the White mountains and up the Connecticut valley to the mouth of the Passumpsic, reaching an altitude of 1000 feet above the sea level; Vermont,--common in the northern Champlain valley, less frequent in the Connecticut valley (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); common in the other New England states, often forming large tracts of woodland, sometimes exclusively occupying extensive areas.       South to Virginia and along the mountains to northern Georgia; west      to western New York, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  =Habit.=--Usually a low tree, from 30 to 50 feet high, with a diameter of 1-2 feet at the ground, but not infrequently rising to 70-80 feet, with a diameter of 2-4 feet; trunk straight or more or less tortuous, tapering rather rapidly; branches rising at a wide angle with the stem, often tortuous, and sometimes drooping at the extremities, distinctly whorled in young trees, but gradually losing nearly every trace of regularity; roughest of our pines, the entire framework rough at every stage of growth; head variable, open,"]]]
