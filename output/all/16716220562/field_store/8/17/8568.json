Charles (as Vice-Chamberlain), the _present_ Lord Conyngham.  \"None of the Royal Family or general visitors lived at the Royal Lodge, but only the Conyngham family; all the rest at Cumberland Lodge. Lady Maria Conyngham (now dead, first wife to Lord Athlumney, daughter of Lord Conyngham), then quite young, and Lord Graves (brother-in-law to Lord Anglesey and who afterwards shot himself on account of his wife's conduct, who was a Lady of the Bedchamber), were desired to take me a drive to amuse me. I went with them, and Baroness (then Miss) Lehzen (my governess) in a pony carriage and 4, with 4 grey ponies (like my own), and was driven about the Park and taken to Sandpit Gate where the King had a Menagerie--with wapitis, gazelles, chamois, etc., etc. Then we went (I think the next day) to Virginia Water, and met the King in his phaeton in which he was driving the Duchess of Gloucester,--and he said 'Pop her in,' and I was lifted in and placed between him and Aunt Gloucester, who held me round the waist. (Mamma was much frightened.) I was greatly pleased, and remember that I looked with great respect at the scarlet liveries, etc. (the Royal Family had crimson and green liveries and only the King scarlet and blue in those days). We drove round the nicest part of Virginia Water and stopped at the Fishing Temple. Here there was a large barge and every one went on board and fished, while a band played in another! There were numbers of great people there, amongst whom was the last Duke of Dorset, then Master of the Horse. The King paid great attention to my Sister,[2] and some people fancied he might marry her!! She was very lovely then--about 18--and had charming manners, about which the King was extremely particular. I afterwards went with Baroness Lehzen and Lady Maria C. to the Page Whiting's cottage. Whiting had been at one time in my father's service. He lived where Mr Walsh now does (and where he died years ago), in the small cottage close by; and here I had some _fruit_ and amused myself by cramming one of Whiting's children, a little girl, with peaches. I came after dinner to hear the band play in the Conservatory, which is still standing, and which was lit up by coloured lamps--the King, Royal Family, etc., sitting in a corner of the large saloon, which still stands.      [Footnote 2: The Princess Feodore of Leiningen, afterwards     Princess of Hohenlohe, Queen Victoria's half-sister.]  \"On the second visit (I _think_) the following year, also in summer, there was a great encampment of tents (the same which were used at the Camp at Chobham in '53, and some single ones at the Breakfasts at Buckingham Palace in '68-9), and which were quite like a house, made into different compartments. It rained dreadfully on this occasion, I well remember. The King and party dined there, Prince and Princess Lieven, the Russian Ambassador and Ambassadress were there.  \"I also remember going to see Aunt Augusta at Frogmore, where she lived always in the summer.  \"We lived in a very simple, plain manner; breakfast was at half-past eight, luncheon at half-past one, dinner at seven--to which I came generally (when it was no regular large dinner party)--eating my bread and milk out of a small silver basin. Tea was only allowed as a great treat in later years.   [Pageheading: DUCHESS OF SAXE-COBURG-SAALFELD]  \"In 1826 (I think) my dear Grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, came to Claremont, in the summer. Mamma and my sister went on part of the way to meet her, and Uncle Leopold I think had been to fetch her as far as Dover. I recollect the excitement and anxiety I was in, at this event,--going down the great flight of steps to meet her when she got out of the carriage, and hearing her say, when she sat down in her room, and fixed her fine clear blue eyes on her little grand-daughter whom she called in her letters 'the flower of May,' 'Ein schönes Kind'--'a fine child.' She was very clever and adored by her children but especially by her sons. She was a good deal bent and walked with a stick, and frequently with her hands on her back. She took long drives in an open carriage and I was frequently sent out with her, which I am sorry to confess I did not like, as, like most children of that age, I preferred running about. She was excessively kind to children, but could not bear naughty ones--and I shall never forget her coming into the room when I had been crying and naughty at my lessons--from the next room but one, where she had been with Mamma--and scolding me severely, which had a very salutary effect. She dined early in the afternoon and Uncle Leopold asked many of the neighbours and others to dinner to meet her. My brother Prince Leiningen came over with her, and was at that time paying his court to one of her ladies, Countess Klebelsberg, whom he afterwards married--against the wish of his grandmother and mother--but which was afterwards quite made up. In November (I think, or it may have been at the end of October) she left, taking my sister with her back to Coburg. I was very ill at that time, of dysentery, which illness increased to an alarming degree; many children died of it in the village of Esher. The Doctor lost his head, having lost his own child from it, and almost every doctor in London was away. Mr Blagden came down and showed much energy on the occasion. I recovered, and remember well being very cross and screaming dreadfully at having to wear, for a time, flannel next my skin. Up to my 5th year I had been very much indulged by every one, and set pretty well _all_ at defiance. Old Baroness de Späth, the devoted Lady of my Mother, my Nurse Mrs Brock, dear old Mrs Louis--_all_ worshipped the poor little fatherless child whose future then was still very uncertain; my Uncle the Duke of Clarence's poor little child being alive, and the Duchess of Clarence had one or two others later. At 5 years old, Miss Lehzen was placed about me, and though she was most kind, she was very firm and I had a proper respect for her. I was naturally very passionate, but always most contrite afterwards. I was taught from the first to beg my maid's pardon for any naughtiness or rudeness towards her; a feeling I have ever retained, and think every one should _own_ their fault in a kind way to any one, be he or she the lowest--if one has been rude to or injured them by word or deed, especially those below you. People will readily forget an insult or an injury when others _own_ their fault, and express sorrow or regret at what they have done.\"   [Pageheading: THE EDUCATION OF THE PRINCESS]  In 1830 the Duchess of Kent wished to be satisfied that the system of education then being pursued with the Princess was based on the right lines, and that due moral and intellectual progress was being made. A memorandum, carefully preserved among the archives, gives an interesting account of the steps which she took to this end.   [Pageheading: LETTER TO THE BISHOPS]  [Pageheading: RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION]  The Duchess therefore brought the matter under the consideration of those whom, from their eminent piety, great learning, and high station, she considered best calculated to afford her valuable advice upon so important a subject. She stated to the Bishops of London and Lincoln[3] the particular course which had been followed in the Princess's education, and requested their Lordships to test the result by personal examination. The nature and objects of Her Royal Highness's appeal to these eminent prelates will be best shown by the following extracts from her letter to the Bishops:--    \"'The Princess will be eleven years of age in May; by the   death of her revered father when she was but eight months old,   her sole care and charge devolved to me. Stranger as I then   was, I became deeply impressed with the absolute necessity of   bringing her up entirely in this country, that every feeling   should be that of Her native land, and proving thereby my   devotion to duty by rejecting all those feelings of home and   kindred that divided my heart.    \"'When the Princess approached her fifth year I considered it   the proper time to begin in a moderate way her education--an   education that was to fit Her to be either the Sovereign of   these realms, or to fill a junior station in the Royal Family,   until the Will of Providence should shew at a later period   what Her destiny was to be.    \"'A revision of the papers I send you herewith will best shew   your Lordships the system pursued, the progress made, etc. I   attend almost always myself every lesson, or a part; and as   the Lady about the Princess is a competent person, she assists   Her in preparing Her lessons for the various masters, as   I resolved to act in that manner so as to be Her Governess   myself. I naturally hope that I have pursued that course most   beneficial to all the great interests at stake. At the present   moment no concern can be more momentous, or in which the   consequences, the interests of the Country, can be more at   stake, than the education of its future Sovereign.    \"'I feel the time to be now come that what has been done   should be put to some test, that if anything has been done in   error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for   the future should be open to consideration and revision. I do   not presume to have an over-confidence in what I have done; on   the contrary, as a female, as a stranger (but only in birth,   as I feel that this is my country by the duties I fulfil, and   the support I receive), I naturally desire to have a candid   opinion from authorities competent to give one. In that view I   address your Lordships; I would propose to you that you advert   to all I have stated, to the papers I lay before you, and that   then you should personally examine the Princess with a view of   telling me--      \"'1. If the course hitherto pursued in Her education has         been the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],["title","The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#6)"],["body","best; if not, where it was erroneous.      \"'2. If the Princess has made all the Progress she should        have made.      \"'3. And if the course I am to follow is that you would        recommend, and if not in what respect you would        desire a change, and on what grounds.    \"'Mr Davys[4] will explain to you the nature of the Princess's   religious education, which I have confided to him, that   she should be brought up in the Church of England as by   Law established. When she was at a proper age she commenced   attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have every   feeling, that she has religion at Her heart, that she is   morally impressed with it to that degree, that she is less   liable to error by its application to Her feelings as a Child   capable of reflection. The general bent of Her character   is strength of intellect, capable of receiving with ease,   information, and with a peculiar readiness in coming to a very   just and benignant decision on any point Her opinion is asked   on. Her adherence to truth is of so marked a character that I   feel no apprehension of that Bulwark being broken down by any   circumstance.    \"'I must conclude by observing that as yet the Princess is not   aware of the station that she is likely to fill. She is aware   of its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others;   so that when Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her   future fate, she receives it with a mind formed to be sensible   of what is to be expected from Her, and it is to be hoped, she   will be too well grounded in Her principles to be dazzled with   the station she is to look to.'\"      [Footnote 3: Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London,     1828-1853, and John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln, 1827-1853.]      [Footnote 4: The Rev. George Davys, the Princess's instructor,     afterwards successively Dean of Chester and Bishop of     Peterborough.]   The examination was undertaken by the Bishops, with highly satisfactory results. Their report says:    \"The result of the examination has been such as in our opinion   amply to justify the plan of instruction which has been   adopted. In answering a great variety of questions proposed to   her, the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the most   important features of Scripture History, and of the leading   truths and precepts of the Christian Religion as taught by   the Church of England, as well as an acquaintance with the   Chronology and principal facts of English History remarkable   in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use of   the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers which   the Princess returned were equally satisfactory.    \"Upon the whole, we feel no hesitation in stating our opinion   that the Princess should continue, for some time to come, to   pursue her studies upon the same plan which has been hitherto   followed, and under the same superintendence. Nor do we   apprehend that any other alterations in the plan will be   required than those which will be gradually made by the   judicious director of Her Highness's studies, as the mind   expands, and her faculties are strengthened.\"   [Pageheading: RESULT OF EXAMINATION]  The Duchess of Kent referred all this correspondence to the Archbishop of Canterbury.[5] His memorandum is preserved; it states he has considered the Report, and further, has himself personally examined the Princess. He continues:    \"I feel it my duty to say that in my judgment the plan of Her   Highness's studies, as detailed in the papers transmitted to me by   command of your Royal Highness, is very judicious, and particularly   suitable to Her Highness's exalted station; and that from the   proficiency exhibited by the Princess in the examination at which   I was present, and the general correctness and pertinency of her   answers, I am perfectly satisfied that Her Highness's education   in regard to cultivation of intellect, improvement of talent, and   religious and moral principle, is conducted with so much care and   success as to render any alteration of the system undesirable.\"      [Footnote 5: Dr William Howley.]  The Princess was gradually and watchfully introduced to public life, and was never allowed to lose sight of the fact that her exalted position carried with it definite and obvious duties. The following speech, delivered at Plymouth in 1832, in answer to a complimentary deputation, may stand as an instance of the view which the Duchess of Kent took of her own and her daughter's responsibilities:--    \"It is very agreeable to the Princess and myself to hear the   sentiments you convey to us. It is also gratifying to us to be assured   that we owe all these kind feelings to the attachment you bear the   King, as well as to his Predecessors of the House of Brunswick, from   recollections of their paternal sway. The object of my life is   to render the Princess worthy of the affectionate solicitude she   inspires, and if it be the Will of Providence she should fill a higher   station (I trust most fervently at a very distant day), I shall   be fully repaid for my anxious care, if she is found competent to   discharge the sacred trust; for communicating as the Princess does   with all classes of Society, she cannot but perceive that the greater   the diffusion of Religion, Knowledge, and the love of freedom in a   country, the more orderly, industrious, and wealthy is its population,   and that with the desire to preserve the constitutional Prerogatives   of the Crown ought to be co-ordinate the protection of the liberties   of the people.\"   [Pageheading: CLAREMONT]  The strictness of the _régime_ under which the Princess was brought up is remarkable; and it is possible that her later zest for simple social pleasures is partly to be accounted for by the austere routine of her early days. In an interesting letter of 1843 to the Queen, recalling the days of their childhood, Princess Feodore, the Queen's half-sister, wrote--  \"Many, many thanks, dearest Victoria, for your kind letter of the 7th from dear Claremont. Oh I understand how you like being there. Claremont is a dear quiet place; to me also the recollection of the few pleasant days I spent during my youth. I always left Claremont with tears for Kensington Palace. When I look back upon those years, which ought to have been the happiest in my life, from fourteen to twenty, I cannot help pitying myself. Not to have enjoyed the pleasures of youth is nothing, but to have been deprived of all intercourse, and not one cheerful thought in that dismal existence of ours, was very hard. My only happy time was going or driving out with you and Lehzen; then I could speak and look as I liked. I escaped some years of imprisonment, which you, my poor darling sister, had to endure after I was married. But God Almighty has changed both our destinies most mercifully, and has made us _so_ happy in our homes--which is the only real happiness in this life; and those years of trial were, I am sure, very useful to us both, though certainly not pleasant. Thank God they are over!... I was much amused in your last letter at your tracing the _quickness_ of our tempers in the female line up to Grandmamma,[6] but I must own that you are _quite right_!\"      [Footnote 6: Augusta Caroline Sophia, Dowager-Duchess     of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a Princess of Reuss Ebersdorf     (1757-1831).]  But if there was little amusement, there was, on the other hand, great devotion; the Princess, as a child, had that peculiar combination of self-will and warm-heartedness which is apt to win for a child a special love from its elders. The Princess Feodore wrote to the Queen, in 1843--  \"... Späth[7] wished _me_ to thank you for the coronation print, as she could not write to you or Albert _now_, she says! why, I don't see. There certainly never was such devotedness as hers, to all our family, although it sometimes shows itself rather foolishly--with you it always was a sort of idolatry, when she used to go upon her knees before you, when you were a child. She and poor old Louis did all they could to spoil you, if Lehzen had not prevented and scolded them nicely sometimes; it was quite amusing.\"      [Footnote 7: Baroness Späth, Lady-in-Waiting to the Duchess of     Kent.]   [Pageheading: WILLIAM IV.]  The Princess was brought up with exemplary simplicity at Kensington Palace, where her mother had a set of apartments. She was often at Claremont, which belonged to her uncle Leopold, King of the Belgians; holidays were spent at Ramsgate, Tunbridge Wells, Broadstairs, and elsewhere.  In June 1830 George IV. died, and William IV. succeeded to the Throne. He had no legitimate offspring living; and it consequently became practically certain that if the Princess outlived her uncle she would succeed him on the Throne. The Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant was increased, and she took advantage of her improved resources to familiarise the Princess with the social life of the nation. They paid visits to historic houses and important towns, and received addresses. This was a wise and prudent course, but the King spoke with ill-humour of his niece's \"royal progresses.\" The chief cause of offence was that the Princess was not allowed by the Duchess of Kent to make her public appearances under his own auspices, as he not unnaturally desired. He also began to suspect that the Princess was deliberately kept away from Court; a painful controversy arose, and the Duchess became gradually estranged from her brother-in-law, in spite of the affectionate attempts of Queen Adelaide to smooth matters over. His resentment culminated in a painful scene, in 1836, when the King, at a State banquet at Windsor, made a speech of a preposterous character; speaking of the Duchess, who sat next him, as \"that person,\" hinting that she was surrounded with evil advisers, and adding that he should insist on the Princess being more at Court. The Princess burst into tears;"]]]
