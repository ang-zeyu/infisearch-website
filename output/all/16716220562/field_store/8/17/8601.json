Still it does seem hard,\" she admitted, as she covertly wiped away a tear, \"particularly when the fault has not been ours--we have always lived within your father's income, even though his practice has been falling off in these bad times, what with his getting up in years, and what with these young doctors trying to get in their hands everywhere. He tells me that he has never had to find fault with me for extravagance,\" she finished wistfully.  \"I should think not,\" said Annie emphatically. \"Why you have always been as simple as simple could be in your own tastes and habits, not a woman in your circle dresses more quietly. You have hardly even driven in the brougham when father was not wanting it, in case you should over-work the horse--you have always said, but I really believe that you chose to walk for the simple reason that many of your acquaintances had no choice. Nobody can ever reflect upon you, mother, for having wasted either father's means or other people's,\" said Annie, with a bright glance which became her infinitely.  \"Thank you, my love, for saying so,\" replied her mother gratefully; \"and you see it is as well that I did not accustom myself to driving, among other indulgences, for another of the retrenchments which your father mentioned was putting down the brougham. Yet how he is to manage his more distant patients on foot, at his age, I cannot imagine,\" she broke off in helpless distress, clasping her hands tightly together, according to a way she had. \"It seems downright madness to propose it.\"  \"Then you may be sure it will be prevented,\" said Dora with earnest trustfulness, as she gently patted her mother's cap. \"Nobody can ask a sacrifice from him which he is unable to make. Mother, do you know what I was thinking? that the only occasions on which you and father were regardless of expense have been where the profit or pleasure of us girls was concerned. You have given us every advantage you could get for us in the shape of education. You sent Annie and me to London to take these costly music-lessons;--Annie, I wish we had made more of them. You arranged that we should go on that foreign tour with the Ludlows.\"  \"We did our best for you--your father and I. I think I may say that,\" admitted Mrs. Millar simply.  Dora went on eagerly with her generous catalogue. \"There was the young artist who exhibits at the Academy and the Grosvenor, who was sketching at Nenthorn, you had him over at a high price once a week, and he condescended to help Rose with her drawing and painting. Then there was Mr. Blake, the university man whom father considered so far in advance of any classical master Miss Burridge could afford, he was induced so long as he was staying at Woodleigh to bring on May with her Latin and Greek.\"  \"So far so good,\" said Mrs. Millar, in her excitement borrowing one of her husband's brisk, cut and dry phrases. \"I hope you will reap the benefit of any effort we made, dears, because\"--she hesitated, and nearly broke down--\"well, I don't think you need mind so much your father's giving up this house and going into a smaller one; I'm sure I don't mind it at all when I think what other people will have to suffer; and as for you, why, you may not be here--not always, at least. We are afraid, your father and I, that you'll need to go and do something to keep yourselves.\"  \"To be sure,\" said Annie promptly. \"Don't trouble about that, mother; we'll be only too glad to be of use!\"  \"We'll be too thankful to relieve you and father as much as we can,\" said Dora in a voice soft and fervent, but less assured.  \"That will be the least trial,\" asserted Annie fearlessly.  \"Oh, you don't know what you're saying!\" cried Mrs. Millar, fairly giving way and permitting herself to sob for a minute or two behind her handkerchief. \"You are dear, good girls! I knew you would be, and so brave that I ought to take courage; but young people are so hopeful and inexperienced. I don't wish you to be unhopeful, of course, still you cannot tell what it is for your father and me to send our girls--our own girls whom we have been so proud and fond of, that have been making the old house brighter and brighter ever since they were born--out into a cold world, to have to struggle for a pittance, to lose their youth and its privileges, to be knocked about, and perhaps ill-treated, and looked down upon by people in every way their inferiors.\"  \"Don't, mother,\" interrupted Annie with decision; \"you're conjuring up bogies which have ceased to exist now-a-days. Think of the women who go out into the world by no compulsion, simply for the honour and pleasure of the thing, because they will not stay at home to lead idle, useless lives, when there is needful work to be done abroad. I don't question that they have difficulties to encounter, but I have yet to learn that staying at home will keep away crosses. Brave women can bear whatever trouble comes. I have often thought of such workers, if you will believe me\"--the girl was in a glow of animation--\"with both shame and envy. It is true I have not proposed to join them,\" she added in a lower tone, \"because I knew I was young for such work and not half good enough or clever enough, and because we were all so happy at home--you and father made us so,\" and Annie turned away her head, and forthwith came tumbling down a few steps from the exalted position she had taken up.  \"No, don't tell me, Annie Millar,\" said her mother with something like passionate resistance, \"that any good father or mother can be glad to send their young daughters out into the wide world to fight and suffer by themselves. It is not natural and it is not true. It is an altogether different thing to give them to good men who will take care of them and make them happy.\"  \"But if the good men are not forthcoming, or if they happen to be the wrong men,\" protested Annie. There was an irresistible twinkle in her dark eyes, in spite of the care and trouble that had come upon the household, which she was too sensible and warm-hearted a girl not to share fully.  Dora stood conscience-stricken and guilty-looking, until, as she stroked her mother's locked hands, she at last found words to put in her humble petition, \"We shan't all go away, mother dear. Father and you must let one of us stay to take care of you and cheer you?\"  \"Oh, my dear, we are not old enough, at least I am not old enough to accept such a boon, supposing we are very poor,\" said Mrs. Millar sadly, \"and in that case it might be sacrificing one of you, and spoiling your prospects in life.\"  \"No, no,\" cried Dora vehemently.  \"Dora means that one of us ought to stay at home to set your cap right,\" said Annie brusquely.  It sounded an inopportune jest, positively unfeeling. The truth was Annie still laboured under the common youthful necessity to hide her deeper feelings, an obligation made up of a touch of hysterical excitement, pride, shyness, and possibly the unsubdued buoyance of two-and-twenty years. The last is apt to rebound swiftly, with a mixture of cheerfulness and defiance from any sorrow, short of the one sorrow which cannot be trampled down or made light of, that has its root in a grave. Annie must find something to laugh at, to get fun out of, in the tribulation which she nevertheless felt in every nerve of her body, to the core of her heart.  \"I ought to be able to keep my cap straight,\" said poor Mrs. Millar very literally and meekly, looking a little puzzled by Annie's ill-timed nonsense, and apparent hardness. \"I daresay I should pin it, but the pins drag my hair so and hurt me.\"  \"Never think of it, mother,\" said mild Dora indignantly, looking daggers at Annie.  \"Of course I did not mean that, mother. I was not in earnest,\" Annie made the penitent amendment.  \"You are right to make the best of things,\" said Mrs. Millar, giving a little shivering sigh on her own account. \"It is the will of Providence. We are in God's hands, poor Mr. Carey and all of us, as we were a year ago--twenty years ago when you two were babies.\"  They were simple truisms which she uttered, but they were honest words, which meant a great deal to her. They borrowed impressiveness from the truthfulness of the speaker, in addition to the truth of the sayings, and by force of sympathy told on the listening girls, quieting and controlling them.  \"Poor Mr. Carey as you say, mother,\" Annie caught up the words. \"Well, I suppose the Careys will be in a far worse plight than we can be, and Cyril has been such a fool, though I don't suppose he meant much harm, with his dandyisms and idleness and his college airs--all that he has brought back from college.\"  \"Hush! child,\" exclaimed the elder, more tolerant woman. \"He has been a silly, selfish lad, but as he will know it now, to his cost, I do not like to hear you casting it in his teeth to-day. Perhaps it will steady him, and then this misfortune will be a blessing so far as he is concerned.\"  \"Rather hard that we should all be sacrificed to prop up Cyril's weak moral nature,\" muttered Annie.  \"And the Russells,\" suggested Dora. \"I have heard Colonel Russell speaking to father, as if he and the Rector also had to do with the bank. Oh! there is Ned Hewett, who has not passed his Cambridge examination any more than Cyril Carey. Not that it has been Ned's fault, or that he goes in for nothing save amusement, only he is so slow over his books, poor fellow! He will grudge his father's having spent money over him to no purpose more than ever now; and Lucy and Bell will be sorry for him--they are so fond of Ned.\"     CHAPTER V.  PROMOTION.

On the Origin of Species  BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION,  OR THE PRESERVATION OF FAVOURED RACES IN THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.  By Charles Darwin, M.A., F.R.S.,  Author of “The Descent of Man,” etc., etc.  Sixth London Edition, with all Additions and Corrections.     “But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws.”  WHEWELL: _Bridgewater Treatise_.   “The only distinct meaning of the word ‘natural’ is _stated_, _fixed_ or _settled;_ since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, _i.e._, to effect it continually or at stated times, as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once.”  BUTLER: _Analogy of Revealed Religion_.   “To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God’s word, or in the book of God’s works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.”  BACON: _Advancement of Learning_.     AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF OPINION ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES, PREVIOUSLY TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK.   I will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the Origin of Species. Until recently the great majority of naturalists believed that species were immutable productions, and had been separately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors. Some few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the descendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over allusions to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details.   [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),  after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn  grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed  out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as  translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to  me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having  this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,  grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the  grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they  were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.  And in like manner as to other parts in which there appears to exist  an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together  (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were  made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been  appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever  things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here  see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little  Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on  the formation of the teeth.   Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much attention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views in 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”, and subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that all species, including man, are descended from other species. He first did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of species, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the analogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of modification, he attributed something to the direct action of the physical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of habit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful adaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of progressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to progress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of simple productions, he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously generated.[2]   [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from  Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page  405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work  a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.  It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,  anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in  his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According  to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme  partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work  written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he  has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl  Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,  for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.  It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views  arise at about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in  England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in  France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the  years 1794-5.   Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son, suspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various degenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the origin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the conditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing species are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est donc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que l’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”  In 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a White Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his paper was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and Single Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply, while the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to sustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I take for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But the same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the most prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in which it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white inhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the United States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to the above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.  The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the fourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his work on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that “horticultural experiments have established, beyond the possibility of refutation, that botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties.” He extends the same view to animals. The dean believes that single species of each genus were created in an originally highly plastic condition, and that these have produced, chiefly by inter-crossing, but likewise by variation, all our existing species.  In 1826 Professor Grant, in the concluding paragraph in his well-known paper (“Edinburgh Philosophical Journal”, vol. XIV, page 283) on the Spongilla, clearly declares his belief that"]]]
