More fussed than ever, he drew back and bent low in apology, while she passed on.  Half a block away, a young man rounded a corner and, seeing her, hastened to join her.  She extended her hand; they chatted a moment, then strolled up the street together.  Fairchild watched blankly, then turned at a chuckle just behind him emanating from the bearded lips of an old miner, loafing on the stone coping in front of a small store.  \"Pick the wrong filly, pardner?\" came the query.  Fairchild managed to smile.  \"Guess so.\"  Then he lied quickly.  \"I thought she was a girl from Denver.\"  \"Her?\"  The old miner stretched.  \"Nope.  That's Anita Richmond, old Judge Richmond's daughter.  Guess she must have been expecting that young fellow--or she would n't have cut you off so short.  She ain't usually that way.\"  \"Her fiancé?\"  Fairchild asked the question with misgiving.  The miner finished his stretch and added a yawn to it.  Then he looked appraisingly up the street toward the retreating figures.  \"Well, some say he is and some say he ain't.  Guess it mostly depends on the girl, and she ain't telling yet.\"  \"And the man--who is he?\"  \"Him?  Oh, he 's Maurice Rodaine.  Son of a pretty famous character around here, old Squint Rodaine.  Owns the Silver Queen property up the hill.  Ever hear of him?\"  The eyes of Robert Fairchild narrowed, and a desire to fight--a longing to grapple with Squint Rodaine and all that belonged to him--surged into his heart.  But his voice, when he spoke, was slow and suppressed.  \"Squint Rodaine?  Yes, I think I have.  The name sounds rather familiar.\"  Then, deliberately, he started up the street, following at a distance the man and the girl who walked before him.     CHAPTER VI  There was no specific reason why Robert Fairchild should follow Maurice Rodaine and the young woman who had been described to him as the daughter of Judge Richmond, whoever he might be.  And Fairchild sought for none--within two weeks he had been transformed from a plodding, methodical person into a creature of impulses, and more and more, as time went on, he was allowing himself to be governed by the snap judgment of his brain rather than by the carefully exacting mind of a systematic machine, such as he had been for the greater part of his adult life.  All that he cared to know was that resentment was in his heart,--resentment that the family of Rodaine should be connected in some way with the piquant, mysterious little person he had helped out of a predicament on the Denver road the day before.  And, to his chagrin, the very fact that there _was_ a connection added a more sinister note to the escapade of the exploded tire and the pursuing sheriff; as he walked along, his gaze far ahead, Fairchild found himself wondering whether there could be more than mere coincidence in it all, whether she was a part of the Rodaine schemes and the Rodaine trickery, whether--  But he ceased his wondering to turn sharply into a near-by drug store, there absently to give an order at the soda fountain and stand watching the pair who had stopped just in front of him on the corner.  She was the same girl; there could be no doubt of that, and he raged inwardly as she chatted and chaffed with the man who looked down upon her with a smiling air of proprietorship which instilled instant rebellion in Fairchild's heart.  Nor did he know the reason for that, either.  After a moment they parted, and Fairchild gulped at his fountain drink. She had hesitated, then with a quick decision turned straight into the drug store.  \"Buy a ticket, Mr. McCauley?\" she asked of the man behind the counter. \"I 've sold twenty already, this morning.  Only five more, and my work 's over.\"  \"Going to be pretty much of a crowd, is n't there?\"  The druggist was fishing in his pocket for money.  Fairchild, dallying with his drink now, glanced sharply toward the door and went back to his refreshment. She was standing directly in the entrance, fingering the five remaining tickets.  \"Oh, everybody in town.  Please take the five, won't you?  Then I 'll be through.\"  \"I 'll be darned if I will, 'Nita!\"  McCauley backed against a shelf case in mock self-defense.  \"Every time you 've got anything you want to get rid of, you come in here and shove it off on me.  I 'll be gosh gim-swiggled if I will.  There 's only four in my family and four 's all I 'm going to take.  Fork 'em over--I 've got a prescription to fill.\"  He tossed four silver dollars on the showcase and took the tickets.  The girl demurred.  \"But how about the fifth one?  I 've got to sell that too--\"  \"Well, sell it to him!\"  And Fairchild, looking into the soda-fountain mirror, saw himself indicated as the druggist started toward the prescription case.  \"I ain't going to let myself get stuck for another solitary, single one!\"  There was a moment of awkward silence as Fairchild gazed intently into his soda glass, then with a feeling of queer excitement, set it on the marble counter and turned.  Anita Richmond had accepted the druggist's challenge.  She was approaching--in a stranger-like manner--a ticket of some sort held before her.  \"Pardon me,\" she began, \"but would you care to buy a ticket?\"  \"To--to what?\"  It was all Fairchild could think of to say.  \"To the Old Timers' Dance.  It's a sort of municipal thing, gotten up by the bureau of mines--to celebrate the return of silver mining.\"  \"But--but I 'm afraid I 'm not much on dancing.\"  \"You don't have to be.  Nobody 'll dance much--except the old-fashioned affairs.  You see, everybody 's supposed to represent people of the days when things were booming around here.  There 'll be a fiddle orchestra, and a dance caller and everything like that, and a bar--but of course there 'll only be imitation liquor.  But,\" she added with quick emphasis, \"there 'll be a lot of things really real--real keno and roulette and everything like that, and everybody in the costume of thirty or forty years ago.  Don't you want to buy a ticket?  It's the last one I 've got!\" she added prettily.  But Robert Fairchild had been listening with his eyes, rather than his ears.  Jerkily he came to the realization that the girl had ceased speaking.  \"When's it to be?\"  \"A week from to-morrow night.  Are you going to be here that long?\"  She realized the slip of her tongue and colored slightly.  Fairchild, recovered now, reached into a pocket and carefully fingered the bills there.  Then, with a quick motion, as he drew them forth, he covered a ten-dollar bill with a one-dollar note and thrust them forward.  \"Yes, I 'll take the ticket.\"  She handed it to him, thanked him, and reached for the money.  As it passed into her hand, a corner of the ten-dollar bill revealed itself, and she hastily thrust it toward him as though to return money paid by mistake.  Just as quickly, she realized his purpose and withdrew her hand.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed, almost in a whisper, \"I understand.\"  She flushed and stood a second hesitant, flustered, her big eyes almost childish as they looked up into his.  \"You--you must think I 'm a cad!\"  Then she whirled and left the store, and a slight smile came to the lips of Robert Fairchild as he watched her hurrying across the street.  He had won a tiny victory, at least.  Not until she had rounded a corner and disappeared did Fairchild leave his point of vantage.  Then, with a new enthusiasm, a greater desire than ever to win out in the fight which had brought him to Ohadi, he hurried to the courthouse and the various technicalities which must be coped with before he could really call the Blue Poppy mine his own.  It was easier than he thought.  A few signatures, and he was free to wander through town to where idlers had pointed out Kentucky gulch and to begin the steep ascent up the narrow road on a tour of prospecting that would precede the more legal and more safe system of a surveyor.  The ascent was almost sheer in places, for in Kentucky gulch the hills huddled close to the little town and rose in precipitous inclines almost before the city limits had been reached.  Beside the road a small stream chattered, milk-white from the silica deposits of the mines, like the waters of Clear Creek, which it was hastening to join. Along the gullies were the scars of prospect holes, staring like dark, blind eyes out upon the gorge;--reminders of the lost hopes of a day gone by.  Here and there lay some discarded piece of mining machinery, rust-eaten and battered now, washed down inch by inch from the higher hill where it had been abandoned when the demonetization of silver struck, like a rapier, into the hearts of grubbing men, years before. It was a cañon of decay, yet of life, for as he trudged along, the roar of great motors came to Fairchild's ears; and a moment later he stepped aside to allow the passage of ore-laden automobile trucks, loaded until the springs had flattened and until the engines howled with their compression as they sought to hold back their burdens on the steep grade.  And it was as he stood there, watching the big vehicles travel down the mountain side, that Fairchild caught a glimpse of a human figure which suddenly darted behind a clump of scrub pine and skirted far to one side, taking advantage of every covering.  A new beat came into Fairchild's heart.  He took to the road again, plodding upward apparently without a thought of his pursuer, stopping to stare at the bleak prospect holes, or to admire the pink-white beauties of the snowy range in the far distance, seemingly a man entirely bereft of suspicion.  A quarter of a mile he went, a half.  Once, as the road turned beside a great rock, he sought its shelter and looked back.  The figure still was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20104"],["title","The Cross-Cut (#8)"],["body","wing, running carefully now along the bank of the stream in an effort to gain as much ground as possible before the return of the road to open territory should bring the necessity of caution again.  A mile more, then, again in the shelter of rocks, he swerved and sought a hiding place, watching anxiously from his concealment for evidences of discovery.  There were none.  The shadower came on, displaying more and more caution as he approached the rocks, glancing hurriedly about him as he moved swiftly from cover to cover.  Closer--closer--then Fairchild repressed a gasp.  The man was old, almost white-haired, with hard, knotted hands which seemed to stand out from his wrists; thin and wiry with the resiliency that outdoor, hardened muscles often give to age, and with a face that held Fairchild almost hypnotized.  It was like a hawk's; hook-beaked, colorless, toneless in all expressions save that of a malicious tenacity; the eyes were slanted until they resembled those of some fantastic Chinese image, while just above the curving nose a blue-white scar ran straight up the forehead,--Squint Rodaine!  So he was on the trail already!  Fairchild watched him pass, sneak around the corner of the rocks, and stand a moment in apparent bewilderment as he surveyed the ground before him.  A mumbling curse and he went on, his cautious gait discarded, walking briskly along the rutty, boulder-strewn road toward a gaping hole in the hill, hardly a furlong away.  There he surveyed the ground carefully, bent and stared hard at the earth, apparently for a trace of footprints, and finding none, turned slowly and looked intently all about him.  Carefully he approached the mouth of the tunnel and stared within.  Then he straightened, and with another glance about him, hurried off up a gulch leading away from the road, into the hills.  Fairchild lay and watched him until he was out of sight, and he knew instinctively that a surveyor would only cover beaten territory now.  Squint Rodaine, he felt sure, had pointed out to him the Blue Poppy mine.  But he did not follow the direction given by his pursuer.  Squint Rodaine was in the hills.  Squint Rodaine might return, and the consciousness of caution bade that Fairchild not be there when he came back.  Hurriedly he descended the rocks once more to turn toward town and toward Mother Howard's boarding house.  He wanted to tell her what he had seen and to obtain her help and counsel.  Quickly he made the return trip, crossing the little bridge over the turbulent Clear Creek and heading toward the boarding house.  Half a block away he halted, as a woman on the veranda of the big, squarely built \"hotel\" pointed him out, and the great figure of a man shot through the gate, shouting, and hurried toward him.  A tremendous creature he was, with red face and black hair which seemed to scramble in all directions at once, and with a mustache which appeared to scamper in even more directions than his hair.  Fairchild was a large man; suddenly he felt himself puny and inconsequential as the mastodonic thing before him swooped forward, spread wide the big arms and then caught him tight in them, causing the breath to puff over his lips like the exhaust of a bellows.  A release, then Fairchild felt himself lifted and set down again.  He pulled hard at his breath.  \"What's the matter with you?\" he exclaimed testily.  \"You 've made a mistake!\"  \"I 'm blimed if I 'ave!\" bellowed a tornado-like voice.  \"Blime!  You look just like 'im!\"  \"But you 're mistaken, old man!\"  Fairchild was vaguely aware that the spray-like mustache was working like a dust-broom, that snappy blue eyes were beaming upon him, that the big red nose was growing redder, while a tremendous paw had seized his own hand and was doing its best to crush it.  \"Blimed if I 'ave!\" came again.  \"You're your Dad's own boy!  You look just like 'im!  Don't you know me?\"  He stepped back then and stood grinning, his long, heavily muscled arms hanging low at his sides, his mustache trying vainly to stick out in more directions than ever.  Fairchild rubbed a hand across his eyes.  \"You 've got me!\" came at last.  \"I--\"  \"You don't know me?  'Onest now, don't you?  I 'm Arry!  Don't you know now?  'Arry from Cornwall!\"     CHAPTER VII  It came to Fairchild then,--the sentence in his father's letter regarding some one who would hurry to his aid when he needed him, the references of Beamish, and the allusion of Mother Howard to a faithful friend.  He forgot the pain as the tremendous Cornishman banged him on the back, he forgot the surprise of it all; he only knew that he was laughing and welcoming a big man old enough in age to be his father, yet young enough in spirit to want to come back and finish a fight he had seen begun, and strong enough in physique to stand it.  Again the heavy voice boomed:  \"You know me now, eh?\"  \"You bet!  You 're Harry Harkins!\"  \"'Arkins it is!  I came just as soon as I got the cablegram!\"  \"The cablegram?\"  \"Yeh.\"  Harry pawed at his wonderful mustache.  \"From Mr. Beamish, you know.  'E sent it.  Said you 'd started out 'ere all alone.  And I could n't stand by and let you do that.  So 'ere I am!\"  \"But the expense, the long trip across the ocean, the--\"  \"'Ere I am!\" said Harry again.  \"Ain't that enough?\"  They had reached the veranda now, to stand talking for a moment, then to go within, where Mother Howard awaited, eyes glowing, in the parlor. Harry flung out both arms.  \"And I still love you!\" he boomed, as he caught the gray-haired, laughing woman in his arms.  \"Even if you did run me off and would n't go back to Cornwall!\"  Red-faced, she pushed him away and slapped his cheek playfully; it was like the tap of a light breeze against granite.  Then Harry turned.  \"'Ave you looked at the mine?\"  The question brought back to Fairchild the happenings of the morning and the memory of the man who had trailed him.  He told his story, while Mother Howard listened, her arms crossed, her head bobbing, and while Harry, his big grin still on his lips, took in the details with avidity.  Then for a moment a monstrous hand scrambled vaguely about in the region of the Cornishman's face, grasping a hair of that radiating mustache now and then and pulling hard at it, at last to drop,--and the grin faded.  \"Le 's go up there,\" he said quietly.  This time the trip to Kentucky gulch was made by skirting town; soon they were on the rough, narrow roadway leading into the mountains. Both were silent for the most part, and the expression on Harry's face told that he was living again the days of the past, days when men were making those pock-marks in the hills, when the prospector and his pack jack could be seen on every trail, and when float ore in a gulley meant riches waiting somewhere above.  A long time they walked, at last to stop in the shelter of the rocks where Fairchild had shadowed his pursuer, and to glance carefully ahead.  No one was in sight.  Harry jabbed out a big finger.  \"That's it,\" he announced, \"straight a'ead!\"  They went on, Fairchild with a gripping at his throat that would not down.  This had been the hope of his father--and here his father had met--what?  He swerved quickly and stopped, facing the bigger man.  \"Harry,\" came sharply, \"I know that I may be violating an unspoken promise to my father.  But I simply can't stand it any longer.  What happened here?\"  \"We were mining--for silver.\"  \"I don't mean that--there was some sort of tragedy.\"  Harry chuckled,--in concealment, Fairchild thought, of something he did not want to tell him.  \"I should think so!  The timbers gave way and the mine caved in!\"  \"Not that!  My father ran away from this town.  You and Mother Howard helped him.  You didn't come back.  Neither did my father.  Eventually it killed him.\"  \"So?\"  Harry looked seriously and studiously at the young man.  \"'E did n't write me of'en.\"  \"He did n't need to write you.  You were here with him--when it happened.\"  \"No--\"  Harry shook his head.  \"I was in town.\"  \"But you knew--\"  \"What's Mother Howard told you?\"  \"A lot--and nothing.\"  \"I don't know any more than she does.\"  \"But--\"  \"Friends did n't ask questions in those days,\" came quietly.  \"I might 'ave guessed if I 'd wanted to--but I did n't want to.\"  \"But if you had?\"  Harry looked at him with quiet, blue eyes.  \"What would you guess?\"  Slowly Robert Fairchild's gaze went to the ground.  There was only one possible conjecture: Sissie Larsen had been impersonated by a woman. Sissie Larsen had never been seen again in Ohadi.  \"I--I would hate to put it into words,\" came finally.  Harry slapped him on the shoulder.  \"Then don't.  It was nearly thirty years ago.  Let sleeping dogs lie. Take a look around before we go into the tunnel.\"  They reconnoitered, first on one side, then on the other.  No one was in sight.  Harry bent to the ground, and finding a pitchy pine knot, lighted it.  They started cautiously within, blinking against the darkness.  A detour and they avoided an ore car, rusty and half filled, standing on the little track, now sagging on moldy ties.  A moment more of walking and Harry took the lead.  \"It's only a step to the shaft now,\" he cautioned.  \"Easy--easy--look out for that 'anging wall--\" he held the pitch torch against the roof of the tunnel and displayed a loose, jagged section of rock, dripping with seepage from the hills above.  \"Just a step now--'ere it is.\"  The outlines of a rusty \"hoist\", with its cable leading down into a slanting hole in the rock, showed dimly before them,--a massive, chunky, deserted thing in the shadows.  About it were clustered drills that were eaten by age and the dampness of the seepage; farther on a \"skip\", or shaft-car, lay on its side, half buried in mud and muck from the walls of the tunnel.  Here, too, the timbers were rotting; one after another, they had cracked and caved beneath the weight of the earth above, giving the tunnel an eerie aspect, uninviting, dangerous. Harry peered ahead.  \""]]]
