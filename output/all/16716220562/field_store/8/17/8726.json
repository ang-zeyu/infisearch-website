Shall you go in the launch?\" he added, hoping with all his strength that the officer would not take the motor boat with him.  \"Certainly,\" was the quick reply. \"I must make progress, you know!\"  Jimmie and Jack, who had followed their chum to the nipa hut, now entered and stood by the door. Ned saw them winking knowingly at each other when the Major spoke of going away in the motor boat, and decided to prod their inclinations a bit.  \"I shall be sorry to have the _Manhattan_ away just now,\" he said, \"for we might use her to good advantage during your absence. However, there seems to be no other way.\"  Jimmie and Jack slid out of the doorway and down the oscillating bamboo stairs, and when, an hour later, the Major went to the little dock where the _Manhattan_ lay he found the two boys working over her, sweating and complaining in loud voices against the inefficiency of modern motor boat manufacturers. The Major went on with his preparations for departure, never doubting that the _Manhattan_ would be ready for him in a few minutes. At last Jimmie turned an oil-smeared face toward Ned.  \"No use,\" he exclaimed, \"she won't go! The batteries are off and there's something wrong with the carbureter, and the spark-plug is twisted, and the delivery is all to the bad. Perhaps Major Ross can bring new parts down from Manila.\"  \"Shut up, you dunce!\" whispered Jack. \"You'll give yourself away!\"  Captain Godwin nudged Ned with an elbow and turned his laughing eyes away. He saw what the boys were doing, and rather approved of the idea of journeys among the islands in the motor boat during the Major's absence.  \"Preposterous!\" shouted the Major. \"You must get the boat in shape to make the voyage to Manila! My mission will not endure delay. Captain Godwin, see what you can do with the boat.\"  Captain Godwin knew about as much of the running gear of a motor boat as did Jimmie, but he at once oiled up his hands and his face and tugged and pulled at the wheel, tapped on the supply pipes, investigated the electric appliance, and finally announced that the boat was not in running order.  The Major blustered about for a few moments and then set forth on his mission in the canoe in which the party had landed.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, at parting, \"I may be able to catch a ship at Banglo, or whatever the name of that little pueblo is on the island to the west. In that case I shall return inside of ten days.\"  And so the Major went away, urging the rowers to greater exertions and wiping his red face with a red handkerchief. Then a strange thing happened. Jack drove Jimmie away from the _Manhattan_, asked Captain Godwin to bring him a wrench, and in ten minutes, or as soon as the canoe bearing the disgusted Major was conveniently around a bend, the boat was sailing about on the river like a bird in the sky.  Captain Godwin started to censure the boys for the deception they had practiced on the Major, but his severe words ended in a laugh.  \"You helped!\" Jimmie said, accusingly. \"You knew what was up! Why didn't you tell him?\"  \"We'll discuss that later,\" was the smiling reply.  \"Anyway,\" Jimmie said, \"we're rid of the old bluffer, and may be able to do somethin', if he stays away long enough.\"  \"You came near spoiling the whole thing,\" declared Jack, grinning at Jimmie. \"You and your talk about twisted spark-plugs! You'd have been finding worn places in the spark next! You know about as much of a motor boat as a pig knows of the hobble skirt. Good thing the Major knows less about a boat than you do!\"  \"Why didn't he use the wire, instead of going off on that long journey?\" asked Jimmie.  \"The government can't lay cables to all these tiny islands,\" Captain Godwin replied, \"but we are promised a wireless outfit before the season closes. Now, if you are ready,\" he added, turning to Ned, \"we'll go back to the hut and make the examination suggested. I'm afraid there was a tragedy there last night.\"  \"Are any of the people missing from the pueblo?\" asked Ned, as the boat came to the dock and they all stepped ashore.  \"Not a man missing,\" was the reply.  \"Have you talked with the man who was sent to the hut to wait on the Lieutenant and his companions?\"  \"Only briefly,\" was the reply, \"but he will be at the hut when we get there. He is rather above the average native in intelligence, and may be able to throw some light on the mystery.\"  \"Is he dependable?\" asked Ned.  \"I think so. He has been with me for a long time, ever since I came to this out-of-the-way jumping-off place.\"  \"Well,\" Ned said, \"you go back to the hut, if you will be so kind, and take the boys with you. I want to look about a little.\"  Captain Godwin hesitated, but Jack started away.  \"Let Ned alone,\" he said. \"He'll be giving us the shape of the aeroplane the Lieutenant and his men sailed away in before long!\"  \"He wants to consult the dream book,\" added Jimmie.  Frank Shaw, who had been sitting on the bridge deck of the _Manhattan_ during this conversation, now sprang ashore and followed along after Ned.  \"You ginks do a lot of talking!\" he said. \"Run along with the Captain and I'll take care of Ned.\"  Ned and Frank examined the ground around the pier and walked up and down the river bank for some distance. Save here and there where the natives drew up their canoes, and where the women came down with the meager family washing, the bank on the pueblo side was covered with a growth of bushes except where the little pier ran out in front of the house with the tin roof.  Several times Frank saw his companion take out a rule and measure impressions he found in the soft earth under the thickets, and once he saw him put something he had picked up in his pocketbook. Knowing well the methods of his chum, Frank looked on with interest and maintained a discreet silence.  When the two reached the hut at last they found Captain Godwin and Jimmie and Jack sitting on the porch with a government map of the islands before them.  \"That is just what I was thinking of,\" Ned said, taking a seat by their side. \"I have yet to learn in what portion of the Philippines we are stopping.\"  \"Strange the Major did not inform you as to that,\" Captain Godwin said.  \"I have an idea that he knew very little of our future movements when we landed here,\" Ned said. \"His instructions were unopened, remember, besides being a month or more old.\"  \"I see,\" observed the Captain. \"Well, you are on a little island of the Babuyan group, in the Balintang channel, north of the island of Luzon and southeast of the coast of China and Hong Kong. The transport sailed due west from Honolulu and to the north of Luzon. The nearest station of any size is Pata, on Luzon. The Major left without informing you as to his instructions?\"  \"Yes, he was in such haste to get away that he left us here without a word of information as to what we were to do. Rotten, don't you think?\"  \"He was in a hurry to get back to the soft side of military life at Manila,\" laughed the Captain. \"Well, before you investigate the hut it may be well for me to give you some idea as to the situation. What I have to say may give direction to your search of the place.\"  \"Everything is as when the discovery of the absence of the men was made, I hope,\" Ned said.  \"Nothing has been touched,\" was the reply.  \"Then go ahead with your story,\" Ned replied. \"I have come a long way on speculation, and am anxious for something tangible.\"  \"Some months ago,\" the Captain began, \"it was discovered that hostile influences--hostile to the United States Government--were at work among the outer islands of the Philippine group.\"  \"I was told that much.\"  \"Yes; well, investigation--and a crude and indifferent investigation it was--developed the fact that the tribes on some of the islands were forming an alliance against Uncle Sam.\"  \"Now,\" said Ned, \"you have come to the end of my information of the subject. What comes next?\"  \"At first little attention was given to the matter. Some of the native tribes are always in revolt, though the news of the battles and skirmishes are kept off the wires. Finally, however, it was learned that rifles were being received by the tribes belonging to this alliance.\"  \"Then some nation alleged to be civilized must be at the bottom of the matter,\" Ned suggested. \"I am anxious for you to come to that point.\"  \"Well,\" hesitated the Captain, \"I don't know what nation to suspect. It seems that no one does. I think that is the problem you were brought here to solve.\"  \"It seems to me that the wise men at Washington ought to be able to secure information on the subject,\" Ned ventured.  \"I half believe that the state department does know a lot about the matter,\" the Captain replied, \"but does not see fit to act in the absence of conclusive proof.\"  \"But how can a mess of Boy Scouts get the truth?\" demanded Ned.  \"By being Boy Scouts,\" was the smiling reply. \"The launch was brought here for your convenience, and you are to go floating about among the islands north of Luzon, hunting, fishing, gathering specimens, and all that until you find out what sort of people it is that is doing this trading with the natives.\"  \"That was the idea in the Canal Zone,\" laughed Ned, \"but we had little hunting to do! It was quick action down there.\"  \"And I hope it will be here,\" said the Captain. \"Military detectives have been sent down here, but have gone back as ignorant as when they came, for the seasoned secret service man shows what his occupation is and betrays"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20208"],["title","Boy Scouts in the Philippines; Or, The Key to the Treaty Box (#3)"],["body","at the start. Now it is up to you. And you must go ahead without further instructions, for Lieutenant Rowe, who was to have posted you as to recent developments, is either dead or a prisoner in the hands of the plotters!\"     CHAPTER III.  THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR.   There was silence on the unsteady porch of the nipa hut for some moments, and then Frank Shaw asked:  \"Is there any proof at all that any government is trying to arm the native tribes against the United States?\"  \"If there is,\" the Captain replied, \"I do not know of it.\"  \"It may be simply a commercial conspiracy,\" said Jack.  \"Go on!\" exclaimed Jimmie. \"If anybody should ask you about it, it is the Japs, or the Chinks!\"  \"When a play fails in New York, or a man jumps off one of the East River bridges, if you leave it to Jimmie, the Japs or the Chinks are at the bottom of it.\"  This from Jack, who ducked low to avoid a blow from the newsboy, and wandered off down the stairs leading to the porch.  \"Yes,\" the Captain said, \"it may be a conspiracy for the acquisition of wealth. I am not an anarchist, but it is my belief that there are many corporations in the world who would set the nations at each other's throats if a profit could be made out of it. But, after all, there is no need of guessing. You boys are here to find out what is going on, and you may now do it in your own way.\"  Ned left the Captain talking with Frank and Jimmie on the porch and went into the one room of the hut. Everything was in disorder there, as has been said, and Ned moved about cautiously in order that nothing might be disturbed. The Major and Captain Godwin, on their visit of the morning, had been careful to leave the place just as it had been on the discovery of the strange happening.  There was a rough table in the center of the room, and three bamboo chairs were overturned beside it. It was in front of one of the chairs that the spots of blood had been found. The light matting which had covered the floor here was torn and twisted, as if a heavy person had clung to it and had been dragged away by superior strength.  Under the edge of this piece of matting Ned found long scratches, as if shoe heels had slipped there and protruding nails had furrowed the floor. There were also various oblong papers and numerous match ends. On the floor, under the rolling back of another chair, were the scattered remnants of a pack of playing cards. Mixed with these, and lying between the ace of clubs and the jack of diamonds, were half a dozen pieces of gilt paper, seemingly torn from an official seal.  In a corner of one of the alcoves, where it had been thrown or wafted by the fan which swung from the ceiling at the middle of the room, was a twisted piece of letter paper burned at one end. It seemed to the boy that the paper had been twisted in the form of a torch and lighted to give a more satisfactory illumination than that provided by the matches which had been burned. It was about half consumed.  After spending half an hour in the room Ned went back to the porch and sat down.  \"What about it?\" asked Frank.  \"The mud is settling,\" laughed Ned.  \"But not so the bottom can be seen?\" asked Captain Godwin with a smile.  \"Not yet,\" was the reply. \"Perhaps a little talk with the servant who was sent here with Lieutenant Rowe last night might help to clear the case,\" he added.  Captain Godwin beckoned to a short, squatty Filipino who stood leaning against a tree not far away and the fellow advanced deferentially up the bamboo stairs, evidently much in awe of the Americanos.  \"Tag,\" the Captain said to him, as he stood with one brown hand clinging to one of the roof supports, \"this gentleman wants to ask you a few questions about what took place last night.\"  \"Yes; I have been waiting.\"  The English was almost perfect, and the fellow's appreciation of the gravity of the situation was apparent. It was later explained to Ned that Tag, as he was called by the Captain, had been educated in an English school at Manila, and had lived in army circles nearly all his life until he had taken service with Captain Godwin.  \"First,\" the Captain put in, \"I want to say that it was not my fault that Lieutenant Rowe did not lodge in my own quarters last night. I proposed that to him, and he said that he had a great deal of work to do, should be moving about more or less during the night, might be detained here several weeks, and so preferred to set up a small establishment of his own. This was the best that could be provided on a moment's notice.\"  \"He was served with supper at your house?\" asked Ned.  \"Yes; and he was to have _desayuno_ there this morning. That is, he was to have his first breakfast with me. Later he was to arrange for a table of his own.\"  \"You came here with them?\" asked Ned of the Filipino.  \"I came on in advance to clear up the place.\"  \"I see. Who came with you?\"  \"Two servants.\"  \"Did they come into this room--the room occupied by the Lieutenant and his companions, I mean?\"  \"No; they were working the fan from the porch.\"  \"Are those men in the place to-day?\"  \"Yes; but they know nothing.\"  \"But they were to remain here during the night?\"  \"They did, but they slept.\"  \"Drugged?\"  \"I don't know. From the complaints they have of their heads I suspect that they were.\"  \"And you were to remain here during the night?\"  \"Yes, that was the understanding, but I was sent away about midnight.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"By Lieutenant Rowe.\"  \"Did he give any reason for sending you away?\"  \"He said they were going to bed and would not need me.\"  \"And did they go to bed as soon as you left? You, of course, remained about the hut for a short time?\"  \"Yes, I remained about the hut for half an hour. They did not go to bed.\"  \"What were they doing?\"  \"The Lieutenant was working over papers and the others were playing cards.\"  \"Could you hear what they were talking about?\"  \"Yes, until the other man came.\"  Ned and the others bent forward with new interest. Here was a fresh feature in the case--a man who had not been referred to before coming into the hut about midnight.  \"Who,\" asked Ned, \"was this other man?\"  \"An Americano.\"  \"Had you seen him about the place before?\"  \"Never. He came in the night and went in the night.\"  \"Was he in uniform--the uniform of a soldier?\"  \"No; he wore citizen's clothes.\"  \"Which way did he come from?\"  \"I don't know,\" was the surprising reply. \"I first saw him when he was climbing in at the window.\"  \"Climbing in at the window!\" repeated Captain Godwin. \"If he climbed in at the window when the others were awake, he must have been expected!\"  \"Yes; I should think so.\"  \"I can't understand this at all!\" exclaimed Captain Godwin, his good-natured face looking anxious. \"Lieutenant Rowe said nothing to me about expecting company. And why should he conceal the fact from me? Why, indeed, should a visitor come crawling in at a window at midnight? Are you sure it wasn't one of the three men I conducted to the hut that you saw at the window?\" he added, turning to the Filipino.  \"Oh, yes; I am quite sure it was a fourth man. He mounted to the window-ledge on a ladder, pushed the screen aside and vaulted over the sill.\"  \"And how was he received?\" asked Ned.  \"He was welcomed, and given a chair at the table. But first he went back to the window and made some sort of a signal to those waiting outside.\"  \"Oh, so there were others waiting outside!\" grated out the Captain. \"Why didn't you come and tell me what was going on? Why didn't you tell me about this the first thing this morning? That is the trouble with these made-over men,\" he continued, half angrily as he looked at Ned. \"You can teach them to do things by rote, but when an emergency comes they are like putty.\"  \"I had no instructions to report what I saw at the hut--no orders to play the spy,\" answered Tag, indignant that his conduct should be criticized. \"And this morning you gave me no chance to talk with you.\"  \"How many people were there outside?\" demanded the Captain.  \"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"There was the flash of a match to show that the signals from the hut were understood, and then I went to bed. There is no accounting for the freaks of these military Americanos, so I went to my bed. If I sat up at night taking note of the movements of the soldiers sent here, I should get no rest at all, besides laughing myself sick over the foolishnesses of them.\"  Ned was watching the fellow with interest. He had no doubt that he was telling the truth about what he had seen there the previous night--that is, the truth so far as he went in the recital. Still, Ned did not trust the fellow. He believed that he had seen more than he had described, even if he had not been a party to what had taken place.  \"What else did you see here last night?\" he asked.  \"Nothing--nothing at all.\"  \"And you say you went to bed without satisfying your natural curiosity as to what you had seen?\" roared the Captain. \"I don't believe it! Buck up now, and tell us what was done after the fourth man entered the hut, or I'll send you to the military prison at Manila.\"  \"I have told everything,\" said Tag with a sniffle. \"You Americanos expect us to see everything and know everything! If we are so wise and capable, why don't you permit us to govern ourselves--send away your soldiers and let us handle the situation here?\"  The Captain frowned and fumed about for a moment, and Ned was afraid he would carry out his threat of placing the Filipino under arrest. This, he believed, would be about the worst move that could be made. Seeking to conciliate the fellow, he said:  \"There is a great deal of sense in what you say, and I honor you for not playing the spy on the officers. Captain Godwin will not send you to prison, I am sure, as we need you here. For instance, we want the story of the men who worked the fan. Will you talk with them and tell us what they say?\"  Tag hastened away, somewhat mollified, and Ned turned to the Captain.  \"The fellow knows more than he"]]]
