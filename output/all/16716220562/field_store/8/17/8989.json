Half a mile back in the woods stood the hut.  It was a stoutly built structure, of logs and stone.  A little clearing lay around it.  For a wonder it had not been burned or broken down, although everything had been cleaned out of it by raiders.  The door swung idly on its hinges. The two Russians were forced to enter the hut.  They were bound with ropes, of which there happened to be some hanging from a nail, the door was closed, huge sticks from a surrounding fence were driven into the ground against it, so that it could not be opened from the inside, and the men were left to their own devices.  As neither Frenchman spoke Russian, and as the Russians understood neither French nor Prussian, conversation was impossible.  Everything had to be done by signs.  \"I wouldn't give much for their chance, shut up in that house in this wood,\" said the grenadier, as the two walked away.  \"Nor I,\" answered Marteau.  \"But at least we haven't killed them.\"  The two Frenchmen now presented a very different appearance.  Before they left the hut they had taken off their own great coats, the bearskin shako of the grenadier, and the high, flat-topped, bell-crowned cap of the line regiment of the officer.  In place of these they wore the flat Russian caps and the long Russian overcoats. Bal-Arrêt might serve for a passable Russian, but no one could mistake Marteau for anything but a Frenchman.  Still, it had to be chanced.  The two retraced their steps and came to the ravine, where the dead Russian lay.  They had no interest in him, save the grenadier's desire to get his knife back.  It had served him well, it might be useful again.  But they had a great interest in the pig.  Their exhausted horses were now useless, and they had thought they would have to kill one to get something to eat.  But the pig, albeit he was a lean one, was a treasure indeed.  To advance upon the Russian line in broad daylight would have been madness.  Darkness was their only hope. Reaching down into the ravine, the grenadier hoisted the body of the poor pig to his comrade, and the two of them lugged it back far in the woods where it was safe to kindle a fire.  With flint and steel and tinder, they soon had a blaze going in the sequestered hollow they had chosen, and the smell of savory roast presently delighted their fancy. They ate their fill for the first time in weeks be it remarked.  If they only had a bottle of the famous wine of the country to wash it down they would have feasted like kings.  \"So far,\" said the grenadier, when he could eat no more, \"our expedition has been successful.  If those youngsters down at Nogent could only smell this pig there would be no holding them.\"  \"I think it would be well to cook as much of it as we can carry with us.  I don't know when we may get any more.\"  \"That is well thought on,\" agreed the old soldier.  \"Always provide for the next meal when you can.\"  \"And, with what's left, as we can't be far from the hut, we'll give those two poor Russians something to eat.\"  \"You're too tender-hearted, my lad,\" said Bullet-Stopper, his face clouded, \"ever to be a great soldier, I am afraid.\"  On an expedition of this kind rank was forgotten, and the humble subordinate again assumed the role of the advisor.  Marteau laughed.  \"Rather than let them starve I would knock them in the head,\" he said.  \"That's what I wanted to do,\" growled the other savagely.  When it came to the issue, however, he really did respect the rank of his young friend.  Accordingly, pieces of the roast pig were taken to the hut and placed in reach of the prisoners, who were found bound as before and looking very miserable.  Yet there was something suspicious in their attitude.  The old grenadier turned one of them over and discovered that one had endeavored to free the other by gnawing at the ropes.  Not much progress had been made in the few hours that had elapsed, but still it was evident that the rope would eventually be bitten through and the men freed.  He pointed this out to his officer.  \"Better finish them now,\" he said.  But Marteau shook his head.  \"It will take them all day and night to get free at that rate; by that time we will be far away, and it will be too late.\"  \"But if they should tell what they have seen?\"  \"What can they tell?  Only that two Frenchmen fell upon them.  No, let them be.  Set the food on the floor here.  If they get hungry they can roll over toward it and eat it.\"  The gags had been taken out of the mouths of the men.  If they did give the alarm there would be none to hear them, save perhaps a French peasant passing that way, and at his hands they would meet short shrift.  Having stuffed their haversacks full of roast pig, they retraced their steps and reached the edge of the clearing.  It was noon by this time, so much of the day had been spent in the various undertakings that have been described, but the Russians were still there.  Evidently they intended to encamp for the day and rest.  Probably it was part of the program.  These would move on, presumably on the morrow, and another division of the army would come up and take their places.  The firing still continued on the horizon.  Marteau, who had a soldierly instinct, divined that the cavalry, which had long since disappeared to the westward, would try to outflank Macdonald, perhaps get in his rear, and this Russian division would move up and join Yorck's attacking force.  The whole proceeding was leisurely.  There was no especial hurry.  There was no use tiring out the men and fighting desperate battles when maneuvering would serve.  The two made a more careful investigation and discovered that trees led across the road about half a mile to the left, and, although the roads were filled with galloping couriers and many straggling men and small commands, yet they decided that by going to the edge of the wood that touched the road and watching their opportunity they could get across unnoticed.  While they stared deliberating a squadron of cavalry, not of Cossacks, but of Russian cuirassiers left the camp and moved off down the cross-road that led to the south and west--the road, indeed, that led to the Château d'Aumenier.  The officer in command rode in front and with him were several civilians, at least, while they were covered with heavy fur cloaks, no uniform was visible, and among the civilians was one unmistakably a woman.  A Frenchman always had an eye for a woman. The party was too far away to distinguish features, but the two men noted the air of distinction about the party and the way the woman rode her horse, the deference that appeared to be paid to her, and they wasted no little time in wondering what might be toward.  However, no explanation presenting itself to their minds, and, the matter being of no great importance after all, they turned their attention to the business in hand.  Working their way through the trees they reached a little coppice close to the road.  They lay down on the ground back of the coppice, wormed their way into it, and waited.  \"Here we part,\" said Marteau.  \"There are but two of us.  We must get all the information we can.  I will find out what division this is in front of us, and I will go back along the road to the eastward and ascertain where the other divisions are, and by nightfall I will return to Sézanne to report to the Emperor.\"  \"And what am I to do?\" asked the grenadier.  \"Remain here?\"  \"You will cross the road and proceed in the direction of the firing. Find out, if you can, how the battle goes, what troops are there, what Marshal Macdonald is doing, and at nightfall retrace your steps and hasten back to Sézanne.\"  \"Where shall I meet you?\"  \"Let me think,\" answered Marteau.  \"I shall first go east and then west, if I can get around that division ahead yonder.  Let us take the road to d'Aumenier.  I will meet you at the old château at ten o'clock, or not later than midnight.  There is a by-road over the marsh and through the forest by the bank of the river to Sézanne.\"  \"I know it.\"  \"Very well, then.  It is understood?\"  Old Bullet-Stopper nodded.  \"The road is clear,\" he said.  \"Good luck.\"  The two men rose to their feet, shook hands.  \"We had better go separately,\" said Marteau.  \"You have the longer distance.  You first.  I will follow.\"  The officer watched the old grenadier anxiously.  He passed the road safely, ran across the intervening space, and disappeared in a little clump of fruit trees surrounding a deserted farmhouse.  The young man waited, listening intently for the sound of a shot or struggle, but he heard nothing.  Then he turned, stepped out into the road, saw it was empty for the moment, set his face eastward, and moved across it to see what he could find out beyond.     CHAPTER V  WHEN THE COSSACKS PASSED  For the first time in years the great hall of the Château d'Aumenier was brightly lighted.  The ancient house stood in the midst of a wooded park adjacent to the village, overlooking one of the little lakes whose outlets flowed into the Morin.  In former days it had been the scene of much hospitality, and, even after the revolution in the period of the consulate and the early empire, representatives of the ancient house had resided there, albeit quietly and in greatly diminished style.  The old Marquis Henri, as uncompromising a royalist soldier as ever lived, had fled to England and had remained there.  His younger brother, Robert, compromising his dignity and his principles alike, had finally made his submission to Napoleon and received back the estates, or what had not been sequestrated.  But he had lived there quietly, had sought no preferment of the government--even rejecting many offers--and had confined his recognition to as narrow limits as possible.  He had married and there had been born to him a daughter, whom he had named after the ancient dames of his honorable house, Laure.  The Count d'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20515"],["title","The Eagle of the Empire: A Story of Waterloo (#8)"],["body","Aumenier, living thus retired, had fallen into rather careless habits after the death of his wife, and the little demoiselle had been brought up indifferently indeed.  Dark, brown-eyed, black-haired, she had given promise of beauty to come.  Left to her own devices she had acquired accomplishments most unusual in that day and by no means feminine.  She could ride, shoot, swim, run, fence, much better than she could dance the old courtly minuet, or the new and popular waltz, just beginning to make its appearance.  A love of reading and an ancient library in which she had a free range had initiated her into many things which the well-brought-up French girl was not supposed to know, and which, indeed, many of them went to their graves without ever finding out.  The Count had a well-stored mind, and on occasion he gave the child the benefit of it, while leaving her mainly to her own devices.  Few of the ancient nobility had come back to the neighborhood.  Their original holdings had been portioned out among the new creations of the Imperial Wizard, and with them the Count held little intercourse. Laure d'Aumenier had not reached the marriageable age, else some of the newly made gentry would undoubtedly have paid court to her.  She found companions among the retainers of her father's estate.  The devotion of some of them had survived the passionate hatreds of the revolution and, failing the Marquis, who was the head of the house, they loyally served his brother, and with pride and admiration gave something like feudal worship and devotion to the little lady.  The Marquis, an old man now, had never forgiven his brother, the Count, for his compromise with principle and for his recognition of the \"usurper,\" as he was pleased to characterize Napoleon.  He had refused even to accept that portion of the greatly diminished revenue of the estate which the younger brother had regularly remitted to the Marquis' bankers in London.  The whole amount lay there untouched and accumulating, although, as were many other emigrés, the Marquis frequently was hard pressed for the bare necessities of life.  With every year, as Bonaparte--for that was the only name by which he thought of him--seemed to be more and more thoroughly established on the throne, the resentment of the Marquis had grown.  Latterly he had refused to hold any communication with his brother.  The year before the Battle of the Nations, or just before Napoleon set forth on his ill-fated Russian adventure, Count Robert d'Aumenier died. With an idea of amendment, which showed how his conscience had smitten him for his compromise, he left everything he possessed to his brother, the Marquis, including his daughter, Laure, who had just reached her sixteenth year.  With the will was a letter, begging the Marquis to take the young demoiselle under his charge, to complete that ill-begun and worse-conducted education, the deficiencies of which the father too late realized, in a manner befitting her station, and to provide for her marriage with a proper portion, as if she had been his own daughter.  The Marquis had never married himself, lacking the means to support his rank, and it was probable that he never would marry.  The Marquis was at first minded to refuse the bequest and to disregard the appeal, but an old retainer of the family, none other than Jean Marteau, the elder, complying with Count Robert's dying wish, had taken the young Countess Laure across the channel, and had quietly left her in her uncle's care, he himself coming back to act as steward or agent for the remaining acres of the shrunken Aumenier domain; for the Marquis, having chosen a course and walked in it for so many years, was not minded even for the sake of being once more the lord of Aumenier to go back to France, since the return involved the recognition of the powers that were.  Old Jean Marteau lived in his modest house between the village and the château.  And the château had been closed for the intervening time. Young Jean Marteau, plodding along the familiar way, after a day full of striking adventure and fraught with important news, instantly noticed the light coming through the half moons in the shutters over the windows of the château, as he came around a brow of the hill and overlooked the village, the lake and the castle in the clearing.  The village was as dark as the château was light.  Marteau was ineffably weary.  He had been without sleep for thirty-six hours, he had ridden twenty leagues and walked--Heaven only knew how many miles in addition.  He had extricated himself from desperate situations only by his courage, daring, and, in one or two cases, by downright fighting, rendered necessary by his determination to acquire accurate information for the Emperor.  He had profited, not only by his instruction in the military school, but by his campaigning, and he now carried in his mind a disposition of the Russian forces which would be of the utmost value to the Emperor.  The need of some rest, however, was absolute.  Marmont's troops, starting out at the same time he had taken his departure, would barely have reached Sézanne by this time, so much more slowly did an army move than a single person.  The Emperor, who had intimated that he would remain at Nogent until the next day, would scarcely undertake the march before morning.  Aumenier lay off to the northwest of Sézanne, distant a few miles.  If the young aide could find something to eat and get a few hours' sleep, he could be at Sézanne before the Emperor arrived and his information would be ready in the very nick of time.  With that thought, after staring hard at the château in some little wonderment, he turned aside from the road that led to its entrance and made for the village.  His mother had died the year before; his father and his sister, with one or two attendants, lived alone.  There was no noble blood in Marteau's veins, as noble blood is counted, but his family had been followers and dependents of the Aumeniers for as many generations as that family had been domiciled in France.  Young Jean Marteau had not only been Laure d'Aumenier's playmate, but he had been her devoted slave as well.  To what extent that devotion had possessed him he had not known until returning from the military school he had found her gone.  The intercourse between the young people had been of the frankest and pleasantest character, but, in spite of the sturdy respectability of the family and the new principles of equality born of the revolution, young Marteau realized--and if he had failed to do so his father had enlightened him--that there was no more chance of his becoming a suitor, a welcome suitor, that is, for the hand of Laure d'Aumenier than there was of his becoming a Marshal of France.  Indeed, as in the case of many another soldier, that last was not an impossibility.  Men infinitely more humble than he in origin and with less natural ability and greatly inferior education had attained that high degree.  If Napoleon lived long enough and the wars continued and he had the opportunity, he, too, might achieve that coveted distinction.  But not even that would make him acceptable to Count Robert, no matter what his career had been; and even if Count Robert could have been persuaded the old Marquis Henri would be doubly impossible.  So, on the whole, Jean Marteau had been glad that Laure d'Aumenier had gone out of his life.  He resolved to put her out of his heart in the same way, and he plunged with splendid energy into the German campaign of 1813, with its singular alternations of success and failure, of victory and defeat, of glory and shame.  He had been lucky enough to win his captain's commission, and now, as a major, with a position on the staff of the Emperor, he could look forward to rapid advancement so long as the Emperor lasted.  With the bright optimism of youth, even though affairs were now so utterly hopeless that the wise old marshals despaired, Marteau felt that his foot was on the first rung of the ladder of fame and prosperity, and, in spite of himself, as he had approached his native village, he had begun to dream again, almost to hope.  There was something ominous, however, in the appearance of the village in that dark gray evening hour.  There were no barking dogs, no clucking hens, no lowing cattle, no sounds of childish laughter, no sturdy-voiced men or softer-spoken women exchanging greetings.  The stables and sheds were strangely silent.  The village was a small one.  He turned into it, entered the first house, stumbled over a corpse!  The silence was of death.  With a beating heart and with a strength he did not know he possessed, he turned aside and ran straight to his father's house.  Standing by itself it was a larger, better and more inviting house than the others.  The gate of the surrounding stone wall was battered off the hinges, the front door of the house was open, the garden was trampled.  The house had been half destroyed.  A dead dog lay in front of the door.  He could see all that in the half light.  He ran down the path and burst into the wrecked and plundered living room.  A few feeble embers still glowed in the broad hearth.  From them he lighted a candle standing on the mantel shelf.  The first sight that greeted him was the body of his sister, her torn clothing in frightful disarray, a look of agony and horror upon her white set face under its dishevelled hair.  She was stone dead.  He knelt down and touched her.  She was stone cold, too.  He stared at her, a groan bursting from his lips.  The groan brought forth another sound.  Was it an echo?  Lifting the candle, he looked about him.  In a far corner lay a huddled human body.  He ran to it and bent over it. It was his father.  Knowing the house like a book, he ran and fetched some water.  There were a few mouthfuls of spirits left in a flask of vodka he had found in the Russian's overcoat.  He bathed his father's face, forced a few drops of the "]]]
