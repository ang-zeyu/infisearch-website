This principle of union was God, ever-living, ever One, eternal, immovable, self-identical.  [58] This was the supreme reality, the Odd-Even or Many in One, One in Many, in whom was gathered up, as in an eternal harmony, all the contrarieties of lower [61] existence. Through the interchange and intergrowth of these contrarieties God realises Himself; the {27} universe in its evolution is the self-picturing of God.  [62] God is diffused as the seminal principle throughout [68] the universe; He is the Soul of the world, and the world itself is God in process.  The world, therefore, is in a sense a living creature.  At its heart and circumference are purest fire; between these circle the sun, the moon, and the five planets, whose ordered movements, as of seven chords, produce an eternal music, the 'Music of the Spheres.'  Earth, too, like the planets, is a celestial body, moving like them around the central fire.  [71]  By analogy with this conception of the universe as the realisation of God, so also the body, whether [72] of man or of any creature, is the realisation for the time being of a soul.  Without the body and the life of the body, that soul were a blind and fleeting ghost.  Of such unrealised souls there are many in various degrees and states; the whole air indeed is full of spirits, who are the causes of dreams and omens.  [73]  Thus the change and flux that are visible in all else are visible also in the relations of soul and body.  Multitudes of fleeting ghosts or spirits are continually seeking realisation through union with bodies, passing at birth into this one and that, and at death issuing forth again into the void.  Like wax which takes now one impression now another, yet remains in itself ever the same, so souls vary in the outward {28} [74] form that envelops and realises them.  In this bodily life, the Pythagoreans are elsewhere described as saying, we are as it were in bonds or in a prison, whence we may not justly go forth till the Lord calls us.  This idea Cicero mistranslated with a truly Roman fitness: according to him they taught that in this life we are as sentinels at our post, who may not quit it till our Commander orders.  On the one hand, therefore, the union of soul with body was necessary for the realisation of the former ((Greek) _soma, body_, being as it were (Greek) _sema, expression_), even as the reality of God was not in the Odd or Eternal Unity, but in the Odd-Even, the Unity in Multiplicity.  On the other hand this union implied a certain loss or degradation.  In other words, in so far as the soul became realised it also became corporealised, subject to the influence of passion and [75] change.  In a sense therefore the soul as realised was double; in itself it partook of the eternal reason, as associated with body it belonged to the realm of unreason.  This disruption of the soul into two the Pythagoreans naturally developed in time into a threefold division, _pure thought_, _perception_, and _desire_; or even more nearly approaching the Platonic division (see below, p. 169), they divided it into _reason_, _passion_, and _desire_.  But the later developments were largely influenced by Platonic and other doctrines, and need not be further followed here.  {29} [78] Music had great attractions for Pythagoras, not only for its soothing and refining effects, but for the intellectual interest of its numerical relations.  Reference has already been made (see above, p. 27) to their quaint doctrine of the music of the spheres; and the same idea of rhythmic harmony pervaded the whole system.  The life of the soul was a harmony; the virtues were perfect numbers; and the influence of music on the soul was only one instance among many of the harmonious relations of things throughout the universe.  Thus we have Pythagoras described as soothing mental afflictions, and bodily ones also, by rhythmic measure and by song.  With the morning's dawn he would be astir, harmonising his own spirit to his lyre, and chanting ancient hymns of the Cretan Thales, of Homer, and of Hesiod, till all the tremors of his soul were calmed and still.  Night and morning also he prescribed for himself and his followers an examination, as it were a _tuning_ and testing of oneself.  At these times especially was it meet for us to take account of our soul and its doings; in the evening to ask, \"Wherein have I transgressed?  What done?  What failed to do?\"  In the morning, \"What must I do?  Wherein repair past days' forgetfulness?\"  But the first duty of all was truth,--truth to one's own highest, truth to the highest beyond us.  Through truth alone could the soul approach the divine.  {30} Falsehood was of the earth; the real life of the soul must be in harmony with the heavenly and eternal verities.  Pythagoreanism remained a power for centuries throughout the Greek world and beyond.  All subsequent philosophies borrowed from it, as it in its later developments borrowed from them; and thus along with them it formed the mind of the world, for further apprehensions, and yet more authentic revelations, of divine order and moral excellence.     {31}  CHAPTER IV  THE ELEATICS  _God and nature--Knowledge and opinion--Being and evolution--Love the creator--The modern egotism_   [79]  I. XENOPHANES.--Xenophanes was a native of Colophon, one of the Ionian cities of Asia Minor, but having been forced at the age of twenty-five to leave his native city owing to some political revolution, he wandered to various cities of Greece, and ultimately to Zancle and Catana, Ionian colonies in Sicily, and thence to Elea or Velia, a Greek city on the coast of Italy.  This city had, like Miletus, reached a high pitch of commercial prosperity, and like it also became a centre of philosophic teaching.  For there Xenophanes remained and founded a school, so that he and his successors received the name of Eleatics. His date is uncertain; but he seems to have been contemporary with Anaximander [80] and Pythagoras, and to have had some knowledge of the doctrine of both.  He wrote in various poetic measures, using against the poets, and especially against Homer and Hesiod, their own weapons, to [83] denounce their anthropomorphic theology.  If oxen {32} or lions had hands, he said, they would have fashioned gods after their likeness which would have been as [85] authentic as Homer's.  As against these poets, and the popular mythology, he insisted that God must be one, eternal, incorporeal, without beginning or ending.  [87] As Aristotle strikingly expresses it, \"He looked forth over the whole heavens and said that God is one, [88] that that which is one is God.\"  The favourite antitheses of his time, the definite and the indefinite, movable and immovable, change-producing and by change produced--these and such as these, he maintained, were inapplicable to the eternally and [86] essentially existent.  In this there was no partition of organs or faculties, no variation or shadow of turning; the Eternal Being was like a sphere, everywhere equal; everywhere self-identical.  [84]  His proof of this was a logical one; the absolutely self-existent could not be thought in conjunction with attributes which either admitted any external influencing Him, or any external influenced by Him.  The prevailing dualism he considered to be, as an ultimate theory of the universe, unthinkable and therefore false.  Outside the Self-existent there could be no second self-existent, otherwise each would be conditioned by the existence of the other, and the Self-existent would be gone.  Anything different from the Self-existent must be of the non-existent, _i.e._ must be nothing.  {33}  One can easily see in these discussions some adumbration of many theological or metaphysical difficulties of later times, as of the origin of evil, of freewill in man, of the relation of the created world to its Creator.  If these problems cannot be said to be solved yet, we need not be surprised that Xenophanes did not solve them.  He was content to emphasise that which seemed to him to be necessary and true, that God was God, and not either a partner with, or a function of, matter.  [89]  At the same time he recognised a world of phenomena, or, as he expressed it, a world of guesswork or opinion ((Greek) _doxa_).  As to the origin of things within this sphere he was ready enough to borrow [90] from the speculations of his predecessors.  Earth and water are the sources from which we spring; and he imagined a time when there was neither sea nor land, but an all-pervading slough and slime; nay, many such periods of inundation and emergence had been, hence the sea-shells on the tops of mountains and the fossils in the rocks.  Air and fire also as agencies of change are sometimes referred to by him; anticipations in fact are visible of the fourfold classification of the elements which was formally made by some of his successors.  [91]  II. PARMENIDES.--The pupil and successor of Xenophanes was PARMENIDES, a native of Elea.  In a celebrated dialogue of Plato bearing the name of {34} this philosopher he is described as visiting Socrates when the latter was very young.  \"He was then already advanced in years, very hoary, yet noble to look upon, in years some sixty and five.\"  Socrates was born about 479 B.C.  The birth of Parmenides might therefore, if this indication be authentic, be about 520.  He was of a wealthy and noble family, and able therefore to devote himself to a learned leisure.  Like his master he expounded his views in verse, and fragments of his poem of considerable length and importance have been preserved.  The title of the work was _Peri Phueos_--_Of Nature_.  [93]  The exordium of the poem is one of some grandeur.  The poet describes himself as soaring aloft to the sanctuary of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20500"],["title","A Short History of Greek Philosophy (#5)"],["body","where it is set in highest aether, the daughters of the Sun being his guides; under whose leading having traversed the path of perpetual day and at length attained the temple of the goddess, he from her lips received instruction in the eternal verities, and had shown to him the deceptive guesses of mortals.  \"'Tis for thee,\" she says, \"to hear of both,--to have disclosed to thee on the one hand the sure heart of convincing verity, on the other hand the guesses of mortals wherein is no ascertainment.  Nevertheless thou shalt learn of these also, that having gone through them all thou may'st see by what unsureness of path must he go who goeth the way of opinion.  From such a way of searching {35} restrain thou thy thought, and let not the much-experimenting habit force thee along the path wherein thou must use thine eye, yet being sightless, and the ear with its clamorous buzzings, and the chattering tongue.  'Tis by Reason that thou must in lengthened trial judge what I shall say to thee.\"  [94]  Thus, like Xenophanes, Parmenides draws a deep division between the world of reason and the world of sensation, between probative argument and the guess-work of sense-impressions.  The former is the world of Being, the world of that which truly is, self-existent, uncreated, unending, unmoved, unchanging, ever self-poised and self-sufficient, like a sphere.  [98] Knowledge is of this, and of this only, and as such, knowledge is identical with its object; for outside this known reality there is nothing.  In other words, Knowledge can only be of that which is, and that which is alone can know.  All things which mortals have imagined to be realities are but words; as of the birth and death of things, of things which were and have ceased to be, of here and there, of now and then.  It is obvious enough that in all this, and in much more to the same effect reiterated throughout the poem, we have no more than a statement, in various forms of negation, of the inconceivability by human reason of that passage from _being_ as such, to that world of phenomena which is now, but was not before, {36} and will cease to be,--from _being_ to _becoming_, from eternity to time, from the infinite to the finite (or, as Parmenides preferred to call it, from the perfect to the imperfect, the definite to the indefinite).  In all this Parmenides was not contradicting such observed facts as generation, or motion, or life, or death; he was talking of a world which has nothing to do with observation; he was endeavouring to grasp what was assumed or necessarily implied as a prior condition of observation, or of a world to observe.  What he and his school seem to have felt was that there was a danger in all this talk of water or air or other material symbol, or even of the _indefinite_ or _characterless_ as the original of all,--the danger, namely, that one should lose sight of the idea of law, of rationality, of eternal self-centred force, and so be carried away by some vision of a gradual process of evolution from mere emptiness to fulness of being. Such a position would be not dissimilar to that of many would-be metaphysicians among evolutionists, who, not content with the doctrine of evolution as a theory in science, an ordered and organising view of observed facts, will try to elevate it into a vision of what is, and alone is, behind the observed facts.  They fail to see that the more blind, the more accidental, so to speak, the process of differentiation may be; the more it is shown that the struggle for existence drives the wheels of progress along the {37} lines of least resistance by the most commonplace of mechanical necessities, in the same proportion must a law be posited behind all this process, a reason in nature which gathers up the beginning and the ending.  The protoplasmic cell which the imagination of evolutionists places at the beginning of time as the starting-point of this mighty process is not merely this or that, has not merely this or that quality or possibility, it _is_; and in the power of that little word is enclosed a whole world of thought, which is there at the first, remains there all through the evolutions of the protoplasm, will be there when these are done, is in fact independent of time and space, has nothing to do with such distinctions, expresses rather their ultimate unreality.  So far then as Parmenides and his school kept a firm grip on this other-world aspect of nature as implied even in the simple word _is_, or _be_, so far they did good service in the process of the world's thought.  On the other hand, he and they were naturally enough disinclined, as we all are disinclined, to remain in the merely or mainly negative or defensive.  He would not lose his grip of heaven and eternity, but he would fain know the secrets of earth and time as well.  And hence was fashioned the second part of his poem, in which he expounds his theory of the world of opinion, or guess-work, or observation.  [99]  In this world he found two originative principles {38} at work, one pertaining to light and heat, the other to darkness and cold.  From the union of these two principles all observable things in creation come, and over this union a God-given power presides, whose name is Love.  Of these two principles, the bright one being analogous to _Fire_, the dark one to _Earth_, he considered the former to be the male or formative element, the latter the female or passive element; the former therefore had analogies to Being as such, the latter to Non-being.  The heavenly existences, the sun, the moon, the stars, are of pure Fire, have therefore an eternal and unchangeable being; they are on the extremest verge of the universe, and corresponding to them at the centre is another fiery sphere, which, itself unmoved, is the cause of all motion and generation in the mixed region between.  The motive and procreative power, sometimes called Love, is at other times called by Parmenides Necessity, Bearer of the Keys, Justice, Ruler, etc.  But while in so far as there was union in the production of man or any other creature, the [102] presiding genius might be symbolised as _Love_; on the other hand, since this union was a union of opposites (Light and Dark), _Discord_ or _Strife_ also had her say in the union. Thus the nature and character in every creature was the resultant of two antagonistic forces, and depended for its particular excellence or defect on the proportions in which these two elements--the {39} light and the dark, the fiery and the earthy--had been commingled.  No character in Greek antiquity, at least in the succession of philosophic teachers, held a more honoured position than Parmenides. He was looked on with almost superstitious reverence by his fellow-countrymen.  Plato speaks of him as his \"Father Parmenides,\" whom he \"revered and honoured more than all the other philosophers together.\"  To quote Professor Jowett in his introduction to Plato's dialogue _Parmenides_, he was \"the founder of idealism and also of dialectic, or in modern phraseology, of metaphysics and of logic.\"  Of the logical aspect of his teaching we shall see a fuller exemplification in his pupil and successor Zeno; of his metaphysics, by way of summing up what has been already said, it may be remarked that its substantial excellence consists in the perfect clearness and precision with which Parmenides enunciated as fundamental in any theory of the knowable universe the priority of Existence itself, not in time merely or chiefly, but as a condition of having any problem to inquire into.  He practically admits that he does not see how to bridge over the partition between Existence in itself and the changeful, temporary, existing things which the senses give us notions of.  But whatever the connection may be, if there is a connection, he is convinced that nothing would be more absurd than {40} to make the data of sense in any way or degree the measure of the reality of existence, or the source from which existence itself comes into being.  On this serenely impersonal position he took his stand; we find little or nothing of the querulous personal note so characteristic of much modern philosophy.  We never find him asking, \"What is to become of _me_ in all this?\"  \"What is _my_ position with regard to this eternally-existing reality?\"  Of course this is not exclusively a characteristic of Parmenides, but of the time.  The idea of personal relation to an eternal Rewarder was only vaguely held in historical times in Greece.  The conception of personal immortality was a mere pious opinion, a doctrine whispered here and there in secret mystery; it was not an influential force on men's motives or actions.  Thought was still occupied with the wider universe, the heavens and their starry wonders, and the strange phenomena of law in nature.  In the succession of the seasons, the rising and setting, the fixities and aberrations, of the heavenly bodies, in the mysteries of coming into being and passing out of it, in these and other similar marvels, and in the thoughts which they evoked, a whole and ample world seemed open for inquiry.  Men and their fate were interesting enough to men, but as yet the egotism of man had not attempted to isolate his destiny from the general problem of nature. {41} To the _crux_ of philosophy as it appeared to Parmenides in the relation of being as such to things which seem to be, modernism has appended a sort of corollary, in the relation of being as such to _my_ being.  Till the second question was raised its answer, of course, could not be attempted.  But all those who in modern times have said with Tennyson--    Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:     Thou madest man, he knows not why;     He thinks he was not made to die;   And Thou hast made him: Thou art just,  may recognise in Parmenides a pioneer for them.  Without knowing it, he was fighting the battle of personality in man, as well as that of reality in nature.     {42"]]]
