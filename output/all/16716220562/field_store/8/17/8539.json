She had lost a little girl about Marian's age and made a point of being especially good to the old-fashioned child who lived in the brick house at the end of the street. The other houses were all white or gray or brown, built plainly, and were either shingled or clap-boarded affairs so that the brick house was a thing apart and its occupants were usually considered the aristocracy of the place. The older men called Grandpa Otway, \"Professor,\" and the younger ones said, \"Good-morning, doctor,\" when they met him.  At the college where he had taught for many years he was still remembered as an absent-minded, gentle but decided person, strong in his opinions, proud and reticent, good as gold, but finding it hard to forgive the only son who left home and married against the wishes of his parents. When baby Marian's mother died her father had written home, asking that his motherless baby might be taken in and reared in the American land which he still loved. So one day Marian arrived in charge of a plain German couple, but her father had not seen her since and he still lived in far off Berlin. Once a year he wrote to his little daughter and she answered the letter through her grandmother. The letter always came the first of the year and the latest one had given an account of a German Christmas. It had enclosed some money for Marian to provide trinkets for her own tree the next year.  Yet, alas,--and here came the tragedy--Marian had never been allowed to have a tree; her grandparents did not approve of such things; the money must go to the missions in foreign lands, and when the next missionary box was sent Marian's Christmas money was sent with it in one form or another. Even if Grandpa and Grandma Otway had known what rebellious tears Marian shed and how she told Tippy that she hated the heathen, and that she didn't see why they couldn't go barefoot in a country as hot as China, and why they couldn't eat rice as well as she, and why missionaries had to have all sorts of things she didn't have, even if her grandparents had known that, they would have said that it showed a wrong spirit and that a little girl bid fair to become a hardened sinner, so she ought to be made to sacrifice her own pleasures to so good a cause.  That would have been the least of it, for there would also have been a long lecture from both grandfather and grandmother with a longer prayer following and there would probably have been an order that Marian must go without butter for a week that she might be taught to practice self-denial. So Marian had thought it wise to say nothing but to accept with as good a grace as possible the bitter necessity of giving up her Christmas tree.  With the mustard seeds folded in her hand she stood watching Mrs. Hunt tie up her spices, but the seeds were forgotten when Mrs. Hunt said: \"What will you do with a teacher living in your house and you not going to school, I'd like to know. Mr. Hunt says he rather guesses you'll not stay at home, but Mrs. Perkins says like as not your grandma will have her teach you out of hours and pay her board that way. As long as she is the daughter of a friend your grandpa would want to make it easy for her and they'll fix it up some way.\"  Marian could scarcely believe her ears. \"Coming to our house? Who is she? What is her name, Mrs. Hunt? When is she coming? Who told you?\"  \"Dear bless me, what a lot of questions. Take care and don't get your sleeve in that vinegar; it'll take all the color out. I'll wipe it up and then you can lean on the table all you want to. There. Well, you see it was Mrs. Leach told me. It seems this Miss Robbins is the daughter of one of the professors at the college where your grandpa was for so many years. He was one of the younger men, Mr. Robbins was, being a student under your grandpa when he first knew him. Now he is one of the professors with a big family and none too well off, so his girl is coming to teach our school and Mr. Robbins asked your grandpa if he wouldn't let her board at his house. She's the eldest, but she hasn't been away from home much because she's had to look after her younger brothers and sisters since her mother died. Professor Robbins feels sort of anxious about her; he is afraid of the wicked wiles of a big city like Greenville.\"  \"Why, Mrs. Hunt, it isn't a big city, is it?\" said Marian innocently.  \"Ain't it?\" laughed Mrs. Hunt. \"At all events he didn't want her cast loose on it, and so he wrote to your grandpa, appealingly, I should say, for it's fixed up that she is to come to the brick house when the fall term begins and that's not far off.\"  \"Oh!\" Marian slipped down from the wooden chair upon which she had seated herself, \"I'd better go home and ask about it,\" she remarked. \"I'd much rather have some one beside grandpa teach me; he uses such terribly long words and talks so long about things I don't understand. Sometimes I can't make out whether I'm very stupid or whether the lessons are extra hard.\"  \"I guess you're no more stupid than the usual run of children,\" said Mrs. Hunt stirring her pickles, \"and I guess you will learn as much about Miss Robbins and her affairs from me as you will at home. But there, go 'long if you want to. Come in to-morrow; I'll be baking cookies,\" she called after the child.  Marian answered with a nod as she looked back. Between the door and the steps she halted once to open her hand and look for the mustard seeds, but in her interest in Mrs. Hunt's news she had let them fall to the floor and but one clung to her moist fingers. She tasted it and found it strong and biting. \"It can't be the bigness,\" she murmured; \"it must mean the hotness and strongness.\" This view of the matter gave her a better understanding, according to her own ideas, and she was glad she had tasted the small seed. After all, there were pleasant things opening up. What if she could not move mountains, there would be fresh cookies to-morrow and out of somewhere a beautiful young lady was advancing toward her, not exactly a playfellow, maybe, but some one much younger than Grandpa and Grandma Otway.     _CHAPTER II_  _The School-Teacher_   The brick house had not the cheerful air of Mrs. Hunt's white-boarded, green-shuttered abode. It was set back a few feet from the side-walk, but a brick wall on each side shut out any glimpse of the flower garden, and the iron railing leading up from the flight of steps gave the place an air unlike the rest of the village houses. Upon the top step Dorothy Robbins stood a few moments before she rang the bell. She cast an upward glance at the windows first; the shutters were all bowed and silence reigned everywhere. She wondered what was behind the brick wall, and if the inmates of the house would look as forbidding and inhospitable as the house itself. She knew the Otways had a little granddaughter and half looked to see the child hanging on the gate or skipping down the path as she approached the house. The door-bell clanged solemnly and presently a sedate, middle-aged woman came to the door.  \"Is Mrs. Otway at home?\" asked Miss Dorothy.  \"No, ma'am, she ain't,\" was the reply given most ungraciously. \"She's to a missionary society or a temperance meeting or something, and he's gone with her.\"  \"Is no one at home?\"  \"I'm here, and Marian's somewhere about, I guess. Was you calculatin' to show goods or solicit anythin'? We hain't no call for dress-makers' charts, and we don't want to subscribe to no cook-books, I'm cook-book enough myself.\"  Dorothy smiled. \"Oh, no. I don't make my living that way,\" she answered cheerfully. \"Perhaps I'd better see the little girl, Miss----\" she added after a few moments' thought.  \"Hepzibah Toothacre is my name,\" remarked the gaunt woman as she turned away leaving the young lady standing on the step.  Dorothy made a wry face. \"Toothacre or some kind of acher I should think,\" she said to herself. \"She looked sour enough to be several kinds of ache rolled in one. I hope the rest of the family are not like that.\"  She did not have to wait long before a little girl came along the dim entry toward her. She was brown-haired, brown-eyed, dark-skinned and rather pale. She wore a plain blue gingham frock, and her hair was tied in two pig-tails with a narrow black ribbon. She paused timidly at sight of a stranger, but at Miss Dorothy's smile she came forward eagerly. \"Oh, are you--are you----\" she began.  \"The new teacher?\" interrupted Miss Dorothy. \"Yes, dear, I am. May I come in? The ogress that guards your castle looked as if she might make a meal of me and I was afraid to come any further.\"  Marian looked puzzled for a moment, then her face broke into a smile. \"Oh, you mean Heppy. She is rather cross sometimes. She was not very polite not to ask you in, but she is in a bad humor to-day; there were two peddlers here this morning and she can't bear peddlers.\"  \"She thought I was one, and that was why she was so grouchy, I see.\"  \"I will go and ask her to show you to your room,\" returned Marian; \"it is all ready.\"  \"Can't you show me?\" asked Miss Dorothy with whimsical anxiety in her tones.  Marian laughed; she knew that Miss Dorothy was only pretending to be afraid of Heppy, and the pretense made her seem more like a little girl. \"Of course I can show you up,\" she made answer. \"Grandma didn't expect you till the late train and she had to go to her missionary society; she's president of the board, you see.\"  \"Oh, yes, I quite understand. I didn't suppose, myself, that I could get here till the late train, but I was able to make better connections than I expected and here I am. My trunk will be along after awhile. You are Maid Marian, I know, but I do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19988"],["title","Little Maid Marian (#2)"],["body"," see the greenwood and where are Robin Hood and his merry men?\" Then seeing that Marian hadn't a notion of what she meant, she said, \"You don't know them, do you? I'll have to tell you some time, you and the rest of my scholars, for of course you are coming to my school.\"  \"Oh, am I?\" Marian's face was radiant.  \"Why, yes, I imagine so. Don't you go to school?\"  \"I haven't been yet. Grandpa has always taught me at home, you know.\"  \"Oh, that's it.\" Miss Dorothy was taking off her hat, standing before the mirror to puff out her soft ripples of hair. \"What a lovely big room this is,\" she remarked. \"I never had such a big room all to myself. We are such a large family that we always have to double up, I don't mean like a jack-knife,\" she added with a little laugh. \"I wonder if I shall have to hunt for myself in that big bed; if I do you will have to come and find me, for I might get hopelessly lost if you didn't.\"  Marian laughed. This merry talk was very delightful; even Mrs. Hunt was never quite so fascinatingly entertaining. She stood gazing at Miss Dorothy with admiring eyes as she put a few touches to her dress. Surely it would mean great things to have a young lady in the house.  Miss Dorothy gave a final survey of the room as she turned from the mirror. \"I like it,\" she said nodding to Marian, \"and when I get down those solemn-looking pictures, hang up my own favorites, put a cheerful cover on that table and a couple of bright sofa pillows on that lounge, and have some plants in that south window, it will be very cozy.\"  \"Oh, will you dare?\" began Marian and then stopped short. There were probably no lengths to which a teacher might not be allowed to go, even by so particular a person as Grandma Otway.  \"Why, what is there so very daring about that?\" asked Miss Dorothy. \"It isn't like walking a tight-rope, or shooting Niagara Falls in a canoe.\" There was a saucy look in her eyes as she spoke, and a dimple came and went as she strove to keep her face grave.  \"It isn't like that, of course,\" said Marian feebly. \"It will be your own room, and you are a grown-up lady who can do as you please. I suppose it is only children who don't dare to do things like moving pictures and putting flower-pots on the window-sills when they are freshly painted.\"  Miss Dorothy's merry laugh rang out. \"Oh, you dear, transparent baby. You've spoken volumes in that speech. Now I'm ready to go down. What shall we do? My trunk will not be here till after the next train is in, they informed me at the station. I'd like to see the schoolhouse, but perhaps we'd best wait till morning, then it can be shown me officially. Could we dare to walk in the garden if I promise not to race over the borders and recklessly pull the flowers? Does one dare to leave the house to do that?\" There was a little mocking look in her eyes as she spoke.  \"Oh, yes, of course we can go anywhere we like in the garden,\" returned Marian. \"Do come, and I will show you my apple tree. If you are not afraid to climb you can see the ocean from my seat in the crotch,--and the mountain, too,\" she added more soberly.  \"Don't suggest mountains yet,\" said Miss Dorothy, becoming sober too. \"But there, I won't think about mountains; I've always managed them and I always intend to.\"  Marian gazed at her with new intentness and drew nearer. \"Can you manage mountains?\" she asked wonderingly.  \"Why, yes; if you don't make them out of mole-hills it is easy enough.\"  Marian pondered over this answer all the way down-stairs, but could not make head or tail of it. She would ask further when she knew Miss Dorothy better. She felt quite assured that she would not be long in feeling as much at home with her as with Mrs. Hunt.  As they passed the kitchen door near which the grim Hepzibah stood, Miss Dorothy drew her skirts aside and fled down the garden walk, giving a pretended scared look over her shoulder as she caught Marian's hand. \"Don't let her get me, will you?\" she said. Marian fell in with her mood and promised that she should not be delivered to the ogress, though in her heart of hearts she felt that a person who would dare to take liberties with Grandma Otway's best room surely could not be a very scary individual, and by the time they had reached the apple tree, she had decided that Miss Dorothy would probably have no fear of climbing to the very top, if she cared to.  \"The Garden of Hesperides and the Golden Apples!\" exclaimed Miss Dorothy, settling down into the crotch and giving Marian a hand to help her to a seat by her side. \"Isn't this too lovely for anything? It will be the finest place in the world to come and read fairy-tales. Do you know many? I have brought a lot with me, and we'll have a lovely time here before it gets too cold to stay out.\"  \"I don't know many fairy-tales,\" Marian answered doubtfully. \"Grandma doesn't exactly approve of them; at least she never tells me any. She says that Bible stories are entertaining enough for any one, and she lets me read those 'simplified for the understanding of a child.'\" She spoke with perfect gravity, though Miss Dorothy turned her head to hide the smile she could not prevent.  \"I suppose, then,\" said Miss Dorothy, \"that you have a book of those.\"  \"Yes; it belonged to grandpa when he was small, and it is called 'Tales from the Bible, simplified for the understanding of a child'; I read it generally on Sundays. Mrs. Hunt knows about Cinderella and the Glass Slipper and about the Pig that huffed and puffed till he blew the house down.\"  \"Oh, I don't know that last one,\" said Miss Dorothy; \"you will have to tell me, and I'll tell you about the Golden Apples. Don't the apples smell good? Do we dare have any of them when they are ripe?\"  \"Oh, yes, we can have two a day; one in the morning and one at noon; grandma says they are lead at night.\"  \"Goodness me! I believe I have heard that saying before,\" said Miss Dorothy, mentally determining to carry apples to her room to eat when she felt inclined. Mrs. Otway should not decide such matters for her. She sat with her chin in her hand looking off at the ocean, blue in the distance. Marian, watching her, decided that although the new teacher did not exactly fill her expectations in some respects, in others she far exceeded them. She had very blue eyes that could be merry or soft as her mood was, her hair was wavy and of a light brown color; she was fair of skin, had rather a large mouth and not a specially beautiful nose, but she was good to look upon and the more one looked the more charming one thought her. She was dressed very simply in a gray traveling gown with no jewelry but a silver pin fastening her collar. Her face in repose was serious and Marian could see that she was not one to be trifled with, in spite of her fun-loving spirit.  \"There are many things I want to know,\" said Miss Dorothy after a while, \"but I will wait till I absolutely have to ask questions.\"  \"If you want to know one thing,\" returned Marian, \"I can tell you. If you would like me to tell you when grandpa and grandma will be here I can say in about five minutes.\" She was looking off down the street and Miss Dorothy saw two figures approaching.  \"Then we'd better go in,\" she said. \"I should not like them to meet me in an apple tree; they might think me very undignified.\"  Marian was rather inclined to think they might, but she glossed over the fact by saying, \"Well, you see it has been such a long, long time since they were young they must forget how it feels.\"  Miss Dorothy smiled and began to climb down the ladder, Marian following. In a few minutes they were walking soberly up the path and reached the front door just as Mr. and Mrs. Otway were there.  \"Miss Robbins has come,\" announced Marian with a little nod of her head in the direction of the young lady in the background.  \"Ah-h,\" responded her grandfather, \"then I was right, my dear,\" he turned to his wife, \"I said it was probable that she would get the first train. We should have told Hepzibah or else you should have remained at home.\"  \"I never remain at home from the quarterly meeting upon any pretext,\" returned Mrs. Otway firmly; \"it was a most important one.\"  But Mr. Otway had hastened forward and was holding out his hand in welcome to Miss Dorothy. \"I am glad to receive my old friend's daughter,\" he said with a stately bow. \"This is Miss--ah, yes, Miss Dorothy. I may have met you when you were less of a young lady, but I cannot separate you, as a memory, from your sisters.\"  \"I think I remember Professor Otway,\" returned Dorothy smiling up into the near-sighted eyes which were peering down at her. Mr. Otway was tall, spare, a little stoop-shouldered. His hair was quite gray and grew sparsely around his temples; his face was clean shaven. Mrs. Otway was below medium height, plump and keen-eyed. She wore an old-fashioned gown and a plain bonnet. Winter or summer she never went out without a small cape over her shoulders. Upon this occasion it was of black silk trimmed with a fold of the same. She looked approvingly at Dorothy's neat frock, but a little disapprovingly at the arrangement of her hair.  \"I am sorry not to have been here to welcome you,\" she said, \"but there are certain matters of business which cannot be set aside for uncertainties. I hope Hepzibah or Marian showed you to your room.\"  \"Marian did, and has been a very kind hostess,\" returned Miss Dorothy. \"I am very glad you did not give up an important matter for anything so indefinite as my arrival. You must never let my presence allow of any change in your arrangements, Mrs. Otway. I am exceedingly grateful to you for taking me in, and I should be very uncomfortable if I were to interfere with your usual routine.\"  Mrs. Otway nodded approval. \"We shall consider you one of the family, my dear Miss Robbins,\" she told her. \"Marian, take my things up-stairs.\" She gave her bonnet and cape to her granddaughter and led the way to the semi-darkened parlor where she established"]]]
