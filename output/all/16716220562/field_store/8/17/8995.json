Elopement was a means of finding some personal privacy.  We should have stayed at home and faced the crude jokes that haven't changed since Pithecanthropus first discovered that sex was funny. But our mutual desire to find some privacy in this modern fish-bowl had put me in the hospital and Catherine--where--?  \"Steve, listen to me!\"  \"Yeah?\"  \"I know you espers. You're sensitive, maybe more so than telepaths. More imagination--\"  This was for the birds in my estimation. Among the customs that Rhine has changed was the old argument as to whether women or men were smarter. Now the big argument was whether espers or telepaths could get along better with the rest of the world.  Thorndyke laughed at my objections and went on: \"You're in accident shock. You piled up your car. You begin to imagine how terrible it would have been if your Catherine had been with you. Next you carefully build up in your subconscious mind a whole and complete story, so well put together that to you it seems to be fact.\"  But, #--how could anyone have taken a look at the scene of the accident and not seen traces of woman? My woman.#  \"We looked,\" he said in answer to my unspoken question. \"There was not a trace, Steve.\"  #Fingerprints?#  \"You'd been dating her.\"  #Naturally!#  Thorndyke nodded quietly. \"There were a lot of her prints on the remains of your car. But no one could begin to put a date on them, or tell how recent was the latest, due to the fire. Then we made a door to door canvas of the neighborhood to be sure she hadn't wandered off in a daze and shock. Not even a footprint. Nary a trace.\" He shook his head unhappily. \"I suppose you're going to ask about that travelling bag you claim to have put in the trunk beside your own. There was no trace of any travelling bag.\"  \"Doctor,\" I asked pointedly, \"if we weren't together, suppose you tell me first why I had a marriage license in my pocket; second, how come I made a date with the Reverend Towle in Midtown; and third, why did I bother to reserve the bridal suite in the Reignoir Hotel in Westlake? Or was I nuts a long time before this accident. Maybe,\" I added, \"after making reservations, I had to go out and pile myself up as an excuse for not turning up with a bride.\"  \"I--all I can say is that there was not a trace of woman in that accident.\"  \"You've been digging in my mind. Did you dig her telephone number?\"  He looked at me blankly.  \"And you found what, when you tried to call her?\"  \"I--er--\"  \"Her landlady told you that Miss Lewis was not in her apartment because Miss Lewis was on her honeymoon, operating under the name of Mrs. Steve Cornell. That about it?\"  \"All right. So now you know.\"  \"Then where the hell is she, Doc?\" The drug was not as all-powerful as it had been and I was beginning to feel excitement again.  \"We don't know, Steve.\"  \"How about the guy that hauled me out of that wreck? What does he say?\"  \"He was there when we arrived. The car had been hauled off you by block and tackle. By the time we got there the tackle had been burned and the car was back down again in a crumpled mass. He is a farmer by the name of Harrison. He had one of his older sons with him, a man about twenty-four, named Phillip. They both swore later that there was no woman in that car nor a trace of one.\"  \"Oh, he did, did he?\"  Dr. Thorndyke shook his head slowly and then said very gently. \"Steve, there's no predicting what a man's mind will do in a case of shock. I've seen 'em come up with a completely false identity, all the way back to childhood. Now, let's take your case once more. Among the other incredible items--\"  \"Incredible?\" I roared.  \"Easy. Hear me out. After all, am I to believe your unsubstantiated story or the evidence of a whole raft of witnesses, the police detail, the accident squad, and the guys who hauled you out of a burning car before it blew up? As I was saying, how can we credit much of your tale when you raved about one man lifting the car and the other hauling you out from underneath?\"  I shrugged. \"That's obviously a mistaken impression. No one could--\"  \"So when you admit that one hunk of your story is mistaken--\"  \"That doesn't prove the rest is false!\"  \"The police have been tracking this affair hard,\" said the doctor slowly. \"They've gotten nowhere. Tell me, did anyone see you leave that apartment with Miss Lewis?\"  \"No,\" I said slowly. \"No one that knew us.\"  Thorndyke shook his head unhappily. \"That's why we have to assume that you are in post-accident shock.\"  I snorted angrily. \"Then explain the license, the date with the reverend, the hotel reservation?\"  Thorndyke said quietly, \"Hear me out, Steve. This is not my own idea alone, but the combined ideas of a number of people who have studied the human mind--\"  \"In other words, I'm nuts?\"  \"No. Shock.\"  \"Shock?\"  He nodded very slowly. \"Let's put it this way. Let's assume that you wanted this marriage with Miss Lewis. You made preparations, furnished an apartment, got a license, made a date with a preacher, reserved a honeymoon suite, and bought flowers for the bride. You take off from work, arrive at her door, only to find that Miss Lewis has taken off for parts unknown. Maybe she left you a letter--\"  \"Letter!\"  \"Hear me out, Steve. You arrive at her apartment and find her gone. You read a letter from her saying that she cannot marry you. This is a rather deep shock to you and you can't face it. Know what happens?\"  \"I blow my brains out along a country road at ninety miles per hour.\"  \"Please, this is serious.\"  \"It sounds incredibly stupid to me.\"  \"You're rejecting it in the same way you rejected the fact that Miss Lewis ran away rather than marry you.\"  \"Do go on, Doctor.\"  \"You drive along the same road you'd planned to take, but the frustration and shock pile up to put you in an accident-prone frame of mind. You then pile up, not consciously, but as soon as you come upon something like that tree limb which can be used to make an accident authentic.\"  \"Oh, sure.\"  Thorndyke eyed me soberly. \"Steve,\" he asked me in a brittle voice, \"you won't try to convince me that any esper will let physical danger of that sort get close enough to--\"  \"I've told you how it happened. My attention was on that busted sign!\"  \"Fine. More evidence to the fact that Miss Lewis was with you? Now listen to me. In accident-shock you'd not remember anything that your mind didn't want you to recall. Failure is a hard thing to take. So now you can blame your misfortune on that accident.\"  \"So now you tell me how you justify the fact that Catherine told landladies, friends, bosses, and all the rest that she was going to marry me a good long time before I was ready to be verbal about my plans?\"  \"I--\"  \"Suppose I've succeeded in bribing everybody to perjure themselves. Maybe we all had it in for Catherine, and did her in?\"  Thorndyke shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I really don't know, Steve. I wish I did.\"  \"That makes two of us,\" I grunted. \"Hasn't anybody thought of arresting me for kidnapping, suspicion of murder, reckless driving and cluttering up the highway with junk?\"  \"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"The police were most thorough. They had two of their top men look into you.\"  \"What did they find?\" I asked angrily. No man likes to have his mind turned inside out and laid out flat so that all the little wheels, cables and levers are open to the public gaze. On the other hand, since I was not only innocent of any crime but as baffled as the rest of them, I'd have gone to them willingly to let them dig, to see if they could dig past my conscious mind into the real truth.  \"They found that your story was substantially an honest one.\"  \"Then why all this balderdash about shock, rejection, and so on?\"  He shook his head. \"None of us are supermen,\" he said simply. \"Your story was honest, you weren't lying. You believe every word of it. You saw it, you went through it. That doesn't prove your story true.\"  \"Now see here--\"  \"It does prove one thing; that you, Steve Cornell, did not have any malicious, premeditated plans against Catherine Lewis. They've checked everything from hell to breakfast, and so far all we can do is make long-distance guesses as to what happened.\"  I snorted in my disgust. \"That's a telepath for you. Everything so neatly laid out in rows of slats like a snow fence. Me--I'm going to consult a scholar and have him really dig me deep.\"  Thorndyke shook his head. \"They had their top men, Steve. Scholar Redfern and Scholar Berks. Both of them Rhine Scholars, _magna cum laude_.\"  I blinked as I always do when I am flabbergasted. I've known a lot of doctors of this and that, from medicine to languages. I've even known a scholar or two, but none of them intimately. But when a doctor of psi is invited to take his scholarte at Rhine, that's it, brother; I pass.  Thorndyke smiled. \"You weren't too bad yourself, Steve. Ran twelfth in your class at Illinois, didn't you?\"  I nodded glumly. \"I forgot to cover the facts. They'd called all the bright boys out and collected them under one special-study roof. I majored in mechanical ingenuity not psi. Hoped to get a D. Ing. out of it, at least, but had to stop. Partly because I'm not ingenious enough and partly because I ran out of cash.\"  Doctor Thorndyke nodded. \"I know how it is,\" he said. I realized that he was leading me away from the main subject gently, but I couldn't see how to lead him back without starting another verbal hassle. He had me cold. He could dig my mind and get the best way to lead me away, while I couldn't read his. I gave up. It felt better, too, getting my mind off this completely baffling puzzle even for a moment. He caught my thoughts but his face didn't twitch a bit as he picked up his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20519"],["title","Highways in Hiding (#2)"],["body","smoothly:  \"I didn't make it either,\" he said unhappily. \"I'm psi and good. But I'm telepath and not esper. I weasled my way through pre-med and medical by main force and awkwardness, so to speak.\" He grinned at me sheepishly. \"I'm not much different than you or any other psi. The espers all think that perception is superior to the ability to read minds, and vice versa. I was going to show 'em that a telepath can make Scholar of Medicine. So I 'pathed my way through med by reading the minds of my fellows, who were all good espers. I got so good that I could read the mind of an esper watching me do a delicate dissecting job, and move my hands according to his perception. I could diagnose the deep ills with the best of them--so long as there was an esper in the place.\"  \"So what tripped you up?\"  \"Telepaths make out best dealing with people. Espers do better with things.\"  \"Isn't medicine a field that deals with people?\"  He shook his head. \"Not when a headache means spinal tumor, or indigestion, or a bad cold. 'Doctor,' says the patient, 'I've a bad ache along my left side just below the ribs,' and after you diagnose, it turns out to be acute appendicitis. You see, Steve, the patient doesn't know what's wrong with him. Only the symptoms. A telepath can follow the patient's symptoms perfectly, but it takes an esper to dig in his guts and perceive the tumor that's pressing on the spine or the striae on his liver.\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"So I flopped on a couple of tests that the rest of the class sailed through, just because I was not fast enough to read their minds and put my own ability to work. It made 'em suspicious and so here I am, a mere doctor instead of a scholar.\"  \"There are fields for you, I'm sure.\"  He nodded. \"Two. Psychiatry and psychology, neither of which I have any love for. And medical research, where the ability to grasp another doctor or scholar's plan, ideas and theories is slightly more important than the ability to dig esper into the experiments.\"  \"Don't see that,\" I said with a shake of my head.  \"Well, Steve, let's take Mekstrom's Disease, for instance.\"  \"Let's take something simple. What I know about Mekstrom's Disease could be carved on the head of a pin with a blunt butter knife.\"  \"Let's take Mekstrom's. That's my chance to make Scholar of Medicine, Steve, if I can come up with an answer to one of the minor questions. I'll be in the clinical laboratory where the only cases present are those rare cases of Mekstrom's. The other doctors, espers every one of them, and the scholars over them, will dig the man's body right down to the last cell, looking and combing--you know some of the better espers can actually dig into the constituency of a cell?--but I'll be the doctor who can collect all their information, correlate it, and maybe come up with an answer.\"  \"You picked a dilly,\" I told him.  It was a real one, all right. Otto Mekstrom had been a mechanic-tech at White Sands Space Station during the first flight to Venus, Mars and Moon round-trip with landings. About two weeks after the ship came home, Otto Mekstrom's left fingertips began to grow hard. The hardening crawled up slowly until his hand was like a rock. They studied him and worked over him and took all sorts of samples and made all sorts of tests until Otto's forearm was as hard as his hand. Then they amputated at the shoulder.  But by that time, Otto Mekstrom's toes on both feet were getting solid and his other hand was beginning to show signs of the same. On one side of the creepline the flesh was soft and normal, but on the other it was all you could do to poke a sharp needle into the skin. Poor Otto ended up a basket case, just in time to have the damned stuff start all over again at the stumps of his arms and legs. He died when hardening reached his vitals.  Since that day, some twenty-odd years ago, there had been about thirty cases a year turn up. All fatal, despite amputations and everything else known to modern medical science. God alone knew how many unfortunate human beings took to suicide without contacting the big Medical Research Center at Marion, Indiana.  Well, if Thorndyke could uncover something, no one could claim that a telepath had no place in medicine. I wished him luck.  I did not see Thorndyke again in that hospital. They released me the next day and then I had nothing to do but to chew my fingernails and wonder what had happened to Catherine.     III   I'd rather not go into the next week and a half in detail. I became known as the bridegroom who lost his bride, and between the veiled accusations and the half-covered snickers, life was pretty miserable. I talked to the police a couple-three times, first as a citizen asking for information and ending up as a complainant against party or parties unknown. The latter got me nowhere. Apparently the police had more lines out than the Grand Bank fishing fleet and were getting no more nibbles than they'd get in the Dead Sea. They admitted it; the day had gone when the police gave out news reports that an arrest was expected hourly, meaning that they were baffled. The police, with their fine collection of psi boys, were willing to admit when they were really baffled. I talked to telepaths who could tell me what I'd had for breakfast on the day I'd entered pre-school classes, and espers who could sense the color of the clothing I wore yesterday. I've a poor color-esper, primitive so to speak. These guys were good, but no matter how good they were, Catherine Lewis had vanished as neatly as Ambrose Bierce.  I even read Charles Fort, although I have no belief in the supernatural, and rather faint faith in the Hereafter. And people who enter the Hereafter leave their remains behind for evidence.  Having to face Catherine's mother and father, who came East to see me, made me a complete mental wreck.  It is harder than you think to face the parents of a woman you loved, and find that all you can tell them is that somehow you fouled your drive, cracked up, and lost their daughter. Not even dead-for-sure. Death, I think, we all could have faced. But this uncertainty was something that gnawed at the soul's roots and left it rotting.  To stand there and watch the tears in the eyes of a woman as she asks you, \"But can't you remember, son?\" is a little too much, and I don't care to go into details.  The upshot of it was, after about ten days of lying awake nights and wondering where she was and why. Watching her eyes peer out of a metal casting at me from a position sidewise of my head. Nightmares, either the one about us turning over and over and over, or Mrs. Lewis pleading with me only to tell her the truth. Then having the police inform me that they were marking this case down as \"unexplained.\" I gave up. I finally swore that I was going to find her and return with her, or I was going to join her in whatever strange, unknown world she had entered.         *       *       *       *       *  The first thing I did was to go back to the hospital in the hope that Dr. Thorndyke might be able to add something. In my unconscious ramblings there might be something that fell into a pattern if it could be pieced together.  But this was a failure, too. The hospital super was sorry, but Dr. Thorndyke had left for the Medical Research Center a couple of days before. Nor could I get in touch with him because he had a six-week interim vacation and planned a long, slow jaunt through Yellowstone, with neither schedule nor forwarding addresses.  I was standing there on the steps hoping to wave down a cruising coptercab when the door opened and a woman came out. I turned to look and she recognized me. It was Miss Farrow, my former nurse.  \"Why, Mr. Cornell, what are you doing back here?\"  \"Mostly looking for Thorndyke. He's not here.\"  \"I know. Isn't it wonderful, though? He'll get his chance to study for his scholarte now.\"  I nodded glumly. \"Yeah,\" I said. It probably sounded resentful, but it is hard to show cheer over the good fortune of someone else when your own world has come unglued.  \"Still hoping,\" she said. It was a statement and not a question.  I nodded slowly. \"I'm hoping,\" I said. \"Someone has the answer to this puzzle. I'll have to find it myself. Everyone else has given up.\"  \"I wish you luck,\" said Miss Farrow with a smile. \"You certainly have the determination.\"  I grunted. \"It's about all I have. What I need is training. Here I am, a mechanical engineer, about to tackle the job of a professional detective and tracer of missing persons. About all I know about the job is what I have read. One gets the idea that these writers must know something of the job, the way they write about it. But once you're faced with it yourself, you realize that the writer has planted his own clues.\"  Miss Farrow nodded. \"One thing,\" she suggested, \"have you talked to the people who got you out from under your car yet?\"  \"No, I haven't. The police talked to them and claimed they knew nothing. I doubt that I can ask them anything that the police have not satisfied themselves about.\"  Miss Farrow looked up at me sidewise. \"You won't find anything by asking people who have never heard of you.\"  \"I suppose not.\"  A coptercab came along at that moment, and probably sensing my intention, he gave his horn a tap. I'd have liked to talk longer with Miss Farrow, but a cab was what I wanted, so with a wave I took it and she went on down the steps to her own business.  I had to pause long enough to buy a new car, but a few hours afterward I was rolling along that same highway with my esper extended as far as I could in all directions. I was driving slowly, this time both alert and ready.  I went past the scene of the accident slowly and shut my mind off as I saw the black-burned patch. The block was still hanging from an overhead branch, and the rope that had burned off was still dangling, about two feet of it, looped through the pulleys and ending in a tapered, burned end.  I turned left into a driveway"]]]
