It floated out on the breeze and hit him like a bullet.  Three months ago Ashe would have accepted the laugh as inevitable, and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him; but long immunity from ridicule had sapped his resolution. He spun round with a jump, flushed and self-conscious.  From the window of the first-floor front of Number Seven a girl was leaning. The Spring sunshine played on her golden hair and lit up her bright blue eyes, fixed on his flanneled and sweatered person with a fascinated amusement. Even as he turned, the laugh smote him afresh.  For the space of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other, eye to eye. Then she vanished into the room.  Ashe was beaten. Three months ago a million girls could have laughed at his morning exercises without turning him from his purpose. Today this one scoffer, alone and unaided, was sufficient for his undoing. The depression which exercise had begun to dispel surged back on him. He had no heart to continue. Sadly gathering up his belongings, he returned to his room, and found a cold bath tame and uninspiring.  The breakfasts--included in the rent--provided by Mrs. Bell, the landlady of Number Seven, were held by some authorities to be specially designed to quell the spirits of their victims, should they tend to soar excessively. By the time Ashe had done his best with the disheveled fried egg, the chicory blasphemously called coffee, and the charred bacon, misery had him firmly in its grip. And when he forced himself to the table, and began to try to concoct the latest of the adventures of Gridley Quayle, Investigator, his spirit groaned within him.  This morning, as he sat and chewed his pen, his loathing for Gridley seemed to have reached its climax. It was his habit, in writing these stories, to think of a good title first, and then fit an adventure to it. And overnight, in a moment of inspiration, he had jotted down on an envelope the words: \"The Adventure of the Wand of Death.\"  It was with the sullen repulsion of a vegetarian who finds a caterpillar in his salad that he now sat glaring at them.  The title had seemed so promising overnight--so full of strenuous possibilities. It was still speciously attractive; but now that the moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became manifest.  What was a wand of death? It sounded good; but, coming down to hard facts, what was it? You cannot write a story about a wand of death without knowing what a wand of death is; and, conversely, if you have thought of such a splendid title you cannot jettison it offhand. Ashe rumpled his hair and gnawed his pen.  There came a knock at the door.  Ashe spun round in his chair. This was the last straw! If he had told Mrs. Ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the morning on any pretext whatsoever, he had told her twenty times. It was simply too infernal to be endured if his work time was to be cut into like this. Ashe ran over in his mind a few opening remarks.  \"Come in!\" he shouted, and braced himself for battle.  A girl walked in--the girl of the first-floor front; the girl with the blue eyes, who had laughed at his Larsen Exercises.  Various circumstances contributed to the poorness of the figure Ashe cut in the opening moments of this interview. In the first place, he was expecting to see his landlady, whose height was about four feet six, and the sudden entry of somebody who was about five feet seven threw the universe temporarily out of focus. In the second place, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry, he had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl, and it was no slight matter to change this on the spur of the moment into a pleasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sitting for half an hour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words: \"The Adventure of the Wand of Death,\" and trying to decide what a wand of death might be, has not his mind under proper control.  The net result of these things was that, for perhaps half a minute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He goggled and he yammered. An alienist, had one been present, would have made up his mind about him without further investigation. For an appreciable time he did not think of rising from his seat. When he did, the combined leap and twist he executed practically amounted to a Larsen Exercise.  Nor was the girl unembarrassed. If Ashe had been calmer he would have observed on her cheek the flush which told that she, too, was finding the situation trying. But, woman being ever better equipped with poise than man, it was she who spoke first.  \"I'm afraid I'm disturbing you.\"  \"No, no!\" said Ashe. \"Oh, no; not at all--not at all! No. Oh, no--not at all--no!\" And would have continued to play on the theme indefinitely had not the girl spoken again.  \"I wanted to apologize,\" she said, \"for my abominable rudeness in laughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry.\"  Science, with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet succeeded in discovering the correct reply for a young man to make who finds himself in the appalling position of being apologized to by a pretty girl. If he says nothing he seems sullen and unforgiving. If he says anything he makes a fool of himself. Ashe, hesitating between these two courses, suddenly caught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring so long.  \"What is a wand of death?\" he asked.  \"I beg your pardon?\"  \"A wand of death?\"  \"I don't understand.\"  The delirium of the conversation was too much for Ashe. He burst out laughing. A moment later the girl did the same. And simultaneously embarrassment ceased to be.  \"I suppose you think I'm mad?\" said Ashe.  \"Certainly,\" said the girl.  \"Well, I should have been if you hadn't come in.\"  \"Why was that?\"  \"I was trying to write a detective story.\"  \"I was wondering whether you were a writer.\"  \"Do you write?\"  \"Yes. Do you ever read Home Gossip?\"  \"Never!\"  \"You are quite right to speak in that thankful tone. It's a horrid little paper--all brown-paper patterns and advice to the lovelorn and puzzles. I do a short story for it every week, under various names. A duke or an earl goes with each story. I loathe it intensely.\"  \"I am sorry for your troubles,\" said Ashe firmly; \"but we are wandering from the point. What is a wand of death?\"  \"A wand of death?\"  \"A wand of death.\"  The girl frowned reflectively.  \"Why, of course; it's the sacred ebony stick stolen from the Indian temple, which is supposed to bring death to whoever possesses it. The hero gets hold of it, and the priests dog him and send him threatening messages. What else could it be?\"  Ashe could not restrain his admiration.  \"This is genius!\"  \"Oh, no!\"  \"Absolute genius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle, and that patronizing ass, by the aid of a series of wicked coincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another month's work done.\"  She looked at him with interest.  \"Are you the author of Gridley Quayle?\"  \"Don't tell me you read him!\"  \"I do not read him! But he is published by the same firm that publishes Home Gossip, and I can't help seeing his cover sometimes while I am waiting in the waiting room to see the editress.\"  Ashe felt like one who meets a boyhood's chum on a desert island. Here was a real bond between them.  \"Does the Mammoth publish you, too? Why, we are comrades in misfortune--fellow serfs! We should be friends. Shall we be friends?\"  \"I should be delighted.\"  \"Shall we shake hands, sit down, and talk about ourselves a little?\"  \"But I am keeping you from your work.\"  \"An errand of mercy.\"  She sat down. It is a simple act, this of sitting down; but, like everything else, it may be an index to character. There was something wholly satisfactory to Ashe in the manner in which this girl did it. She neither seated herself on the extreme edge of the easy-chair, as one braced for instant flight; nor did she wallow in the easy-chair, as one come to stay for the week-end. She carried herself in an unconventional situation with an unstudied self-confidence that he could not sufficiently admire.  Etiquette is not rigid in Arundell Street; but, nevertheless, a girl in a first-floor front may be excused for showing surprise and hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a second-floor front young man whom she has known only five minutes. But there is a freemasonry among those who live in large cities on small earnings.  \"Shall we introduce ourselves?\" said Ashe. \"Or did Mrs. Bell tell you my name? By the way, you have not been here long, have you?\"  \"I took my room day before yesterday. But your name, if you are the author of Gridley Quayle, is Felix Clovelly, isn't it?\"  \"Good heavens, no! Surely you don't think anyone's name could really be Felix Clovelly? That is only the cloak under which I hide my shame. My real name is Marson--Ashe Marson. And yours?\"  \"Valentine--Joan Valentine.\"  \"Will you tell me the story of your life, or shall I tell mine first?\"  \"I don't know that I have any particular story. I am an American.\"  \"Not American!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because it is too extraordinary, too much like a Gridley Quayle coincidence. I am an American!\"  \"Well, so are a good many other people.\"  \"You miss the point. We are not only fellow serfs--we are fellow exiles. You can't round the thing off by telling me you were born in Hayling, Massachusetts, I suppose?\"  \"I was born in New York.\"  \"Surely not! I didn't know anybody was.\"  \"Why Hayling, Massachusetts?\"  \"That was where I was born.\"  \"I'm afraid I never heard of it.\"  \"Strange. I know your home town quite well. But I have not yet made my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall. I am beginning to realize that I am one of the failures.\"  \"How old are you?\"  \"Twenty-six.\"  \"You are only twenty-six and you call yourself a failure? I think that is a shameful thing to say.\"  \"What would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2042"],["title","Something New (#2)"],["body","call a man of twenty-six whose only means of making a living was the writing of Gridley Quayle stories--an empire builder?\"  \"How do you know it's your only means of making a living? Why don't you try something new?\"  \"Such as?\"  \"How should I know? Anything that comes along. Good gracious, Mr. Marson; here you are in the biggest city in the world, with chances for adventure simply shrieking to you on every side.\"  \"I must be deaf. The only thing I have heard shrieking to me on every side has been Mrs. Bell--for the week's rent.\"  \"Read the papers. Read the advertisement columns. I'm sure you will find something sooner or later. Don't get into a groove. Be an adventurer. Snatch at the next chance, whatever it is.\"  Ashe nodded.  \"Continue,\" he said. \"Proceed. You are stimulating me.\"  \"But why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you? Surely London is enough to do it without my help? You can always find something new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own resources about five years ago--never mind how. Since then I have worked in a shop, done typewriting, been on the stage, had a position as governess, been a lady's maid--\"  \"A what! A lady's maid?\"  \"Why not? It was all experience; and I can assure you I would much rather be a lady's maid than a governess.\"  \"I think I know what you mean. I was a private tutor once. I suppose a governess is the female equivalent. I have often wondered what General Sherman would have said about private tutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war. Was it fun being a lady's maid?\"  \"It was pretty good fun; and it gave me an opportunity of studying the aristocracy in its native haunts, which has made me the Gossip's established authority on dukes and earls.\"  Ashe drew a deep breath--not a scientific deep breath, but one of admiration.  \"You are perfectly splendid!\"  \"Splendid?\"  \"I mean, you have such pluck.\"  \"Oh, well; I keep on trying. I'm twenty-three and I haven't achieved anything much yet; but I certainly don't feel like sitting back and calling myself a failure.\"  Ashe made a grimace.  \"All right,\" he said. \"I've got it.\"  \"I meant you to,\" said Joan placidly. \"I hope I haven't bored you with my autobiography, Mr. Marson. I'm not setting myself up as a shining example; but I do like action and hate stagnation.\"  \"You are absolutely wonderful!\" said Ashe. \"You are a human correspondence course in efficiency, one of the ones you see advertised in the back pages of the magazines, beginning, 'Young man, are you earning enough?' with a picture showing the dead beat gazing wistfully at the boss' chair. You would galvanize a jellyfish.\"  \"If I have really stimulated you-----\"  \"I think that was another slam,\" said Ashe pensively. \"Well, I deserve it. Yes, you have stimulated me. I feel like a new man. It's queer that you should have come to me right on top of everything else. I don't remember when I have felt so restless and discontented as this morning.\"  \"It's the Spring.\"  \"I suppose it is. I feel like doing something big and adventurous.\"  \"Well, do it then. You have a Morning Post on the table. Have you read it yet?\"  \"I glanced at it.\"  \"But you haven't read the advertisement pages? Read them. They may contain just the opening you want.\"  \"Well, I'll do it; but my experience of advertisement pages is that they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you any sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of hand only. However, I will scan them.\"  Joan rose and held out her hand.  \"Good-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write, and I have to think out something with a duke in it by to-night; so I must be going.\" She smiled. \"We have traveled a good way from the point where we started, but I may as well go back to it before I leave you. I'm sorry I laughed at you this morning.\"  Ashe clasped her hand in a fervent grip.  \"I'm not. Come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it. I like being laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half of London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in convulsions. I'm not an attraction any longer and it makes me feel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises and you saw only part of the first. You have done so much for me that if I can be of any use to you, in helping you to greet the day with a smile, I shall be only too proud. Exercise Six is a sure-fire mirth-provoker; I'll start with it to-morrow morning. I can also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it.\"  \"Very well. Well, good-by for the present.\"  \"Good-by.\"  She was gone; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at the door which had closed behind her. He felt as though he had been wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock.  Close beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now luminous and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay the Morning Post, the advertisement columns of which he had promised her to explore. The least he could do was to begin at once.  His spirits sank as he did so. It was the same old game. A Mr. Brian MacNeill, though doing no business with minors, was willing--even anxious--to part with his vast fortune to anyone over the age of twenty-one whose means happened to be a trifle straitened. This good man required no security whatever; nor did his rivals in generosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan Macfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too, showed a curious distaste for dealing with minors; but anyone of maturer years could simply come round to the office and help himself.  Ashe threw the paper down wearily. He had known all along that it was no good. Romance was dead and the unexpected no longer happened. He picked up his pen and began to write \"The Adventure of the Wand of Death.\"    CHAPTER II  In a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel Guelph in Piccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with his knees drawn up to his chin, and glared at the day with the glare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had was suffering.  He had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake up, feeling as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see the sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a perfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you met last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you remember.  \"Oh, dash it!\" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's pause: \"And I was feeling so dashed happy!\"  For the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad meditation; then, picking up the telephone from the table at his side, he asked for a number.  \"Hello!\"  \"Hello!\" responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.  \"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?\"  \"Who is that?\"  \"This is Freddie Threepwood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to see you about something devilish important. Will you be in at twelve?\"  \"Certainly. What's the trouble?\"  \"I can't explain over the wire; but it's deuced serious.\"  \"Very well. By the way, Freddie, congratulations on the engagement.\"  \"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't forget to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by.\"  He replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, for he had heard the door handle turn. When the door opened he was giving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in beginning his toilet for the day.  An elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered. He regarded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.  \"Are you only just getting up, Frederick?\"  \"Hello, gov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now.\"  \"You should have been out and about two hours ago. The day is glorious.\"  \"Shan't be more than a minute, gov'nor, now. Just got to have a tub and then chuck on a few clothes.\"  He disappeared into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair, placed the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude remained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed annoyance.  Like many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had suffered much through that problem which, with the exception of Mr. Lloyd-George, is practically the only fly in the British aristocratic amber--the problem of what to do with the younger sons.  It is useless to try to gloss over the fact--in the aristocratic families of Great Britain the younger son is not required.  Apart, however, from the fact that he was a younger son, and, as such, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always annoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was so constituted that no man or thing really had the power to trouble him deeply; but Freddie had come nearer to doing it than anybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a perseverance, about his irritating performances that had acted on the placid peer as dripping water on a stone. Isolated acts of annoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm; but Freddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to Eton.  He had been expelled from Eton for breaking out at night and roaming the streets of Windsor in a false mustache. He had been sent down from Oxford for pouring ink from a second-story window on the junior dean of his college. He had spent two years at an expensive London crammer's and failed to pass into the army. He had also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts, besides as shady a gang of friends--for the most part vaguely connected with the turf--as any young man of his age ever contrived to collect.  These things try the most placid of parents; and finally Lord Emsworth had put his foot down. It was the only occasion in his life when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the accumulated energy of years. He stopped his son's allowance, haled him home to Blandings Castle, and kept him there so relentlessly that until the previous night, when they had come up together by an afternoon train, Freddie had not"]]]
