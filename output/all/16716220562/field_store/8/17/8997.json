Since it was summer by now, the closed windows and the tight door, neither of which had flyscreens installed, quickly gave the fact away. The Harrisons were gone.  Another disappearance?  I turned quickly and drove to the nearest town and went to the post office.  \"I'm looking for the Harrison family,\" I told the man behind the wicket.  \"Why, they moved several weeks ago.\"  \"Moved?\" I asked with a blank-sounding voice.  The clerk nodded. Then he leaned forward and said in a confidential whisper, \"Heard a rumor that the girl got a touch of that spacemen's disease.\"  \"Mekstrom's?\" I blurted.  The clerk looked at me as if I'd shouted a dirty word. \"She was a fine girl,\" he said softly. \"It's a shame.\"  I nodded and he went into the back files. I tried to dig alone behind him, but the files were in a small dead area in the rear of the building. I swore under my breath although I'd expected to find files in dead areas. Just as Rhine Institute was opened, the Government combed the countryside for dead or cloudy areas for their secret and confidential files. There had been one mad claim-staking rush with the Government about six feet ahead of the rest of the general public, business and the underworld.  He came back with a sorrowful look. \"They left a concealed address,\" he said.  I felt like flashing a twenty at him like a private eye did in the old tough-books, but I knew it wouldn't work. Rhine also made it impossible for a public official to take a bribe. So instead, I tried to look distressed.  \"This is extremely important. I'd say it was a matter of life and death.\"  \"I'm sorry. A concealed forwarding address is still concealed. If you must get in touch with them, you might drop them a letter to be forwarded. Then if they care to answer, they'll reply to your home.\"  \"Later,\" I told him. \"I'll probably be back to mail it direct from here.\"  He waved at the writing desk. I nodded and left.  I drove back to the ex-Harrison Farm slowly, thinking it over. Wondering. People did not just go around catching Mekstrom's Disease, from what little I knew of it. And somehow the idea of Marian Harrison withering away or becoming a basket case, or maybe taking the painless way out was a thought that my mind kept avoiding except for occasional flashes of horror.  I drove in toward the farmhouse again and parked in front of the verandah. I was not sure of why I was there except that I wanted to wander through it to see what I could find before I went back to the post-office to write that card or letter.  The back of the house was locked with an old-fashioned slide bolt that was turned with what they used to call an \"E\" key. I shrugged, oiled my conscience and found a bit of bent wire. Probing a lock like that would have been easy for a total blank; with esper I lifted the simple keepers and slid back the bolt almost as swiftly as if I had used a proper key.  This was no case of disappearance. In every one of the fourteen rooms were the unmistakable signs of a deliberate removal. Discarded stuff was mixed with the odds and ends of packing case materials, a scattered collection of temporary nails, a half-finished but never used box filled with old clothing.  I pawed through this but found nothing, even though I separated it from the rest to help my esper dig it without interference.  I roamed the house slowly letting my perception wander from point to point. I tried to time-dig the place but that was futile. I didn't have enough perception.  I caught only one response. It was in one of the upper bedrooms. But then as I stopped in the room where Marian had slept, I began again to doubt my senses. It could have been esper, but it was more likely that I'd caught the dying traces of perfume.  Then I suddenly realized that the entire premises were clear to me!  An esper map of the world looked sort of like a mottled sky, with bright places and cloudy patches strewn in disorder across it. A mottled sky, except that the psi-pattern usually does not change. But this house had been in a murky area, if not dead. Now it was clear.  I left the house and went to the big combination barn and garage. It was as unsatisfying as the house had been. Phillip Harrison, or someone, had had a workshop out there. I found the bench and a small table where bolt-holes, oil marks, and other traces said that there had been one of those big combination woodworking machines there, the kind that combines circular saw, drill, lathe, planer, router, dado, and does everything. There had been some metal-working stuff there, too, but nothing as elaborate as the woodshop. Mostly things like hacksaws and an electric drill, and a circular scar where a blowtorch had been sitting.  I don't know why I kept on standing there esping the abandoned set-up. Maybe it was because my esper dug the fact that there was something there that I should know about, but which was so minute or remote that the impression did not come through. I stood there puzzled at my own reluctance to leave until something satisfied that almost imperceptible impression.  Idly I leaned down and picked up a bit of metal from the floor and fumbled it in my hand nervously. I looked around the place with my eyes and saw nothing. I gave the whole garage a thorough scanning with my esper and got zero for my trouble.  Finally I snarled at myself for being an imbecile, and left.  Everyone has done what I did, time and time again. I do not recall anything of my walk back to the car, lost in a whirl of thoughts, ideas, plans and questions. I would probably have driven all the way back to my apartment with my mind in that whirligig, driving by habit and training, but I was shaken out of it because I could not start my car by poking that bit of metal in the lock. It did not fit.  I laughed, a bit ashamed of my preoccupation, and flung the bit of metal into the grass, poked my key in the lock--  And then I was out pawing the grass for that piece of metal.  For the small piece of metal I had found on the floor of the abandoned workshop was the spoke of that road sign that had been missing when Catherine and I cracked up!  I drove out along the highway and stopped near one of the standards. I esped the sign, compared my impression against my eyesight. I made sure.  That bit of metal, a half inch long and a bit under a quarter inch in diameter, with both ends faintly broken-ragged, was identical in size and shape to the unbroken spokes in the sign!  Then I noticed something else. The trefoil ornament in the middle did not look the same as I recalled them. I took Thorndyke's card out of my pocket and looked at the stereo. I compared the picture against the real thing before me and I knew that I was right.  The trefoil gizmo was a take-off on the fleur-de-lis or the Boy Scout Tenderfoot badge, or the design they use to signify North on a compass. But the lower flare of the leaves was wider than any of the more familiar emblems; almost as wide as the top. It took a comparison to tell the difference between one of them right-side-up and another one upside-down. One assumes for this design that the larger foils are supposed to be up. If that were so, then the ones along that road out there in or near Yellowstone were right-side-up, while the ones along my familiar highway were upside-down.  I goaded myself. #Memory, have these things been turned or were they always upside-down?#  The last thing I did as I turned off the highway was to stop and let my esper dig that design once more. I covered the design itself, let my perception roam along the spokes, and then around the circlet that supported the spokes that held the trefoil emblem.  Oh, it was not obvious. It was designed in, so to speak. If I were asked even today for my professional opinion I would have to admit that the way the circlet snapped into the rest of the ornamental scrollwork was a matter of good assembly design, and not a design deliberately created so that the emblem could be turned upside down.  In fact, if it had not been for that tiny, broken spoke I found on the floor of the Harrison garage, never in a million years would I have considered these road signs significant.         *       *       *       *       *  At the post office I wrote a letter to Phillip Harrison:       _Dear Phil:_       _I was by your old place today and was sorry to find that you had      moved. I'd like to get in touch with you again. If I may ask,      please send me your forwarding address. I'll keep it concealed if      you like, or I'll reply through the post office, concealed      forward._       _As an item of interest, did you know that your house has lost its      deadness? A medium-equipped esper can dig it with ease. Have you      ever heard of the psi-pattern changing before?_       _Ah, and another item, that road sign with the busted spoke has      been replaced. You must be a bum shot, not to hit that curlicue in      the middle. I found the spoke you hit on the floor of your garage,      if you'd like it for a souvenir of one close miss._       _Please write and let me know how things are going. Rumor has it      that Marian contracted Mekstrom's and if you will pardon my      mentioning a delicate subject, I am doing so because I really want      to help if I am able. After all, no matter how lightly you hold it,      I still owe you my life. This is a debt I do not intend to forget._       _Sincerely,_       _Steve Cornell._     V   I did not go to the police.  They were sick of my face and already considering me a candidate for the paranoid ward. All I would have to do is go roaring into the station to tell them that I had uncovered some deep plot where the underground was using ornamental road signs to conceal their own network of roads and directions, and that the disappearance of Catherine Lewis, Dr. Thorndyke and the removal of the Harrisons were all tied "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20519"],["title","Highways in Hiding (#6)"],["body","together.  Instead, I closed my apartment and told everyone that I was going to take a long, rambling tourist jaunt to settle my nerves; that I thought getting away from the scene might finish the job that time and rest had started.  Then I started to drive. I drove for several days, not attempting to pace off miles, but covering a lot of aimless-direction territory. I was just as likely to spend four hours going North on one highway, and then take the next four coming back South on a parallel highway, and sometimes I even came back to the original starting place. After a week I had come no farther West than across that sliver of West Virginia into Eastern Ohio. And in Eastern Ohio I saw some more of the now familiar and suspicious road signs.  The emblem was right side up, and the signs looked as though they had not been up long.  I followed that road for seventy-five miles, and as I went the signs kept getting newer and newer until I finally came to a truck loaded with pipe, hardware, and ornamental ironwork. Leading the truck was one of those iron mole things.  I watched the automatic gear hoist one of the old pipe and white and black enamel roadsigns up by its roots, and place it on a truck full of discards. I watched the mole drive a corkscrew blade into the ground with a roaring of engine and bucking of the truck. It paused, pulled upward to bring out the screw and its load of dirt, stones and gravel. The crew placed one of the new signs in the cradle and I watched the machine set the sign upright, pour the concrete, tamp down the earth, and then move along down the road.  There was little point in asking questions of the crew, so I just took off and drove to Columbus as hard as I could make it.         *       *       *       *       *  Shined, cleaned, polished, and very conservatively dressed, I presented myself to the State Commissioner of Roads and Highways. I toyed briefly with the idea of representing myself as a minor official from some distant state like Alaska or the Virgin Islands, inquiring about these signs for official reasons. But then I knew that if I bumped into a hot telepath I'd be in the soup. On the other hand, mere curiosity on the part of a citizen, well oiled with compliments, would get me at the very least a polite answer.  The Commissioner's fifth-under-secretary bucked me down the hall; another office bucked me upstairs. A third buck-around brought me to the Department of Highways Marking and Road Maps.  A sub-secretary finally admitted that he might be able to help me. His name was Houghton. But whether he was telepath or esper did not matter because the Commission building was constructed right in the middle of a dead area.  I still played it straight. I told him I was a citizen of New York, interested in the new road signs, Ohio was to be commended, et cetera.  \"I'm glad you feel that way,\" he said beaming.  \"I presume these signs cost quite a bit more than the stark, black and white enamel jobs?\"  \"On the contrary,\" he said with pride. \"They might, but mass-production methods brought the cost down. You see, the enamel jobs, while we buy several thousand of the plates for any highway, must be set up, stamped out, enamelled, and so on. The new signs are all made in one plant as they are needed; I don't suppose you know, but the highway number and any other information is put on the plate from loose, snap-in letters. That means we can buy so many thousand of this or that letter or number, and the necessary base plates and put them together as needed. They admitted that they were still running at a loss, but if they could get enough states interested, they'd eventually come out even, and maybe they could reduce the cost. Why, they even have a contingent-clause in the contract stating that if the cost were lowered, they would make a rebate to cover it. That's so the first users will not bide their time instead of buying now.\"  He went on and on and on like any bureaucrat. I was glad we were in a dead area because he'd have thrown me out of his office for what I was thinking.  Eventually Mr. Houghton ran down and I left.  I toyed around with the idea of barging in on the main office of the company but I figured that might be too much like poking my head into a hornet's nest.  I pocketed the card he gave me from the company, and I studied the ink-fresh road map, which he had proudly supplied. It pointed out in a replica panel of the fancy signs, that the State of Ohio was beautifying their highways with these new signs at no increased cost to the taxpayer, and that the dates in green on the various highways here and there gave the dates when the new signs would be installed. The bottom of the panel gave the Road Commissioner's name in boldface with Houghton's name below in slightly smaller print.  I smiled. Usually I get mad at signs that proclaim that such and such a tunnel is being created by Mayor So-and-so, as if the good mayor were out there with a shovel and hoe digging the tunnel. But this sort of thing would have been a worthy cause if it hadn't been for the sinister side.  I selected a highway that had been completed toward Cincinnati and made my way there with no waste of time.         *       *       *       *       *  The road was new and it was another beaut. The signs led me on, mile after mile and sign after sign.  I did not know what I was following, and I was not sure I knew what I was looking for. But I was on the trail of something and a bit of activity, both mental and physical, after weeks of blank-wall frustration made my spirits rise and my mental equipment sharper. The radio in the car was yangling with hillbilly songs, the only thing you can pick up in Ohio, but I didn't care. I was looking for something significant.  I found it late in the afternoon about half-way between Dayton and Cincinnati. One of the spokes was missing.  Fifty yards ahead was a crossroad.  I hauled in with a whine of rubber and brakes, and sat there trying to reason out my next move by logic. Do I turn with the missing spoke, or do I turn with the one that is not missing?  Memory came to my aid. The \"ten o'clock\" spoke had been missing back there near the Harrison farm. The Harrisons had lived on the left side of the highway. One follows the missing spoke. Here the \"two o'clock\" spoke was missing, so I turned to the right along the crossroad until I came to another sign that was complete.  Then, wondering, I U-turned and drove back across the main highway and drove for about five miles watching the signs as I went. The ones on my right had that trefoil emblem upside down. The ones on my left were right side up. The difference was so small that only someone who knew the significance would distinguish one from the other. So far as I could reason out, it meant that what I sought was in the other direction. When the emblem was upside down I was going away from, and when right side up, I was going toward.  Away from or toward what?  I U-turned again and started following the signs.  Twenty miles beyond the main highway where I'd seen the sign that announced the turn, I came upon another missing spoke. This indicated a turn to the left, and so I slowed down until I came upon a homestead road leading off toward a farmhouse.  I turned, determined to make like a man lost and hoping that I'd not bump into a telepath.  A few hundred yards in from the main road I came upon a girl who was walking briskly toward me. I stopped. She looked at me with a quizzical smile and asked me if she could be of any help.  Brashly, I nodded. \"I'm looking for some old friends of mine,\" I said. \"Haven't seen them for years. Named Harrison.\"  She smiled up at me. \"I don't know of any Harrison around here.\" Her voice had the Ohio twang.  \"No?\"  \"Just where do they live?\"  I eyed her carefully, hoping my glance did not look like a wolf eyeing a lamb. \"Well, they gave me some crude directions. Said I was to turn at the main highway onto this road and come about twenty miles and stop on the left side when I came upon one of those new road signs where someone had shot one of the spokes out.\"  \"Spokes? Left side--\" She mumbled the words and was apparently mulling the idea around in her mind. She was not more than about seventeen, sun-tanned and animal-alive from living in the open. I wondered about her. As far as I was concerned, she was part and parcel of this whole mysterious affair. No matter what she said or did, it was an obvious fact that the hidden road sign directions pointed to this farm. And since no one at seventeen can be kept in complete ignorance of the business of the parents, she must be aware of some of the ramifications.  After some thought she said, \"No, I don't know of any Harrisons.\"  I grunted. I was really making the least of this, now that I'd arrived.  \"Your folks at home?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" she replied.  \"I think I'll drop in and ask them, too.\"  She shrugged. \"Go ahead,\" she said with the noncommittal attitude of youth. \"You didn't happen to notice whether the mailbox flag was up, did you?\"  I hadn't, but I espied back quickly and said, \"No, it isn't.\"  \"Then the mailman hasn't been to deliver,\" she said. \"Mind if I ride back to the house with you, mister?\"  \"Hop in.\"  She smiled brightly and got in quickly. I took off down the road toward the house at an easy pace. She seemed interested in the car, and finally said, \"I've never been in a car like this before. New?\"  \"Few weeks,\" I responded.  \"Fast?\"  \"If you want to make it go fast. She'll take this rocky road at fifty, if anyone wants to be so foolish.\"  \"Let's see.\"  I laughed. \"Nobody but an idiot would tackle a road like this at fifty.\"  \"I like to go fast. My brother takes it at sixty.\"  That, so far as I was concerned, was youthful exaggeration. I was busy telling her all the perils of fast driving when a rabbit came barrelling out of the bushes along one side and streaked across in front of me.  I twitched the wheel. The car went out"]]]
