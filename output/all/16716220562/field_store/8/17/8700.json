Kock made an attempt to escape, but he was powerless in the hands of two determined men. Some time elapsed before he realised the hopelessness of the situation, as his last attempt to induce Commandant van Diggelen to deliver a note to his men outside was met with a blank refusal. The next thing to be done was to get rid of these men, who evidently had been instructed by their \"General\" not to leave without him, he probably fearing that something unforeseen might happen to him. How now to get rid of these men? The following ruse was adopted: Dr. Krause took up some telegrams, and, waving these in the air, rushed out to where they were stationed, demanding to know who the officer in charge was. He was met by a confusion of voices calling out, \"Where is our General?\" \"Oh!\" was the reply, \"your General is still in my office, consulting on military matters, and I have just received information that the British are advancing on the town from the direction of the Gueldenhuis. Your General commands you to proceed in that direction to reinforce the Boers, who are trying to stop the advance. We will follow immediately with the rest of the men. Now! who is in command?\" \"I am, sir--Captain McCullum.\" \"Now, Captain,\" the Doctor said, \"ride for your life and do your duty.\"  The ruse was successful, and in a few minutes not a single man of the band was in sight. The next question was, what was to be done with Kock. The following plan was adopted: The arrest took place shortly before the luncheon hour, and as the offices were generally closed from one till two, Kock was detained in the Commandant's office until one. All officials were then ordered to leave. Van Diggelen ordered his dog-cart to be brought round, Kock was told to step in, and was quietly driven to the fort, where he was detained by the officer in charge.  During the afternoon General Botha and his staff passed through Johannesburg, and came to see Dr. Krause, who reported what had happened. General Botha approved of and confirmed his action in every respect. The conference between the two officers did not last long, and resulted in Dr. Krause being definitely instructed to remain in Johannesburg in order to protect the town and its inhabitants, and to see that all fighting burghers immediately left for their respective commandos. The same evening Kock was sent to Pretoria, escorted by several police, and handed over to the authorities there.  The great danger which had threatened the safety of the mines was in this way averted.  Before closing this chapter, mention should be made of the excellent work done by the Mines Police in the protection of the mines, and in this connection especially to name Commandant L.E. van Diggelen and Lt. W. Vogts, the energetic Secretary of the Force.  The gold found on the Robinson Mine was on the same Tuesday sent by Dr. Krause to Pretoria in charge of Captain Arendt Burkhardt and several members of the Field Police, and was duly delivered by them to the authorities there.         *       *       *       *       *  _Note._--The subsequent career of Kock was an eventful one. He lost his father, J.H. Kock, at the battle of Elandslaagte. This and other matters so preyed upon his mind that eventually he became subject to delusions, and is at present confined in the lunatic asylum at Pretoria.     CHAPTER III  THE SURRENDER OF THE GOLDEN CITY   In attempting to chronicle the events which surround the surrender of Johannesburg, the mind involuntarily pauses, and a picture, which reminds one of the fairy-tales of one's childhood, is called up in imagination.  In 1886 Johannesburg could only boast of a few tin shanties--the beginnings of a mining camp; fourteen years later the British troops marched through the streets of a modern city. And what has been the history of these fourteen years?  In the history of the older European nations development and progress are slow, and social and economic cause and effect can be traced with almost scientific accuracy. In Johannesburg, however, ordinary human agencies do not seem to have been at work. The man who has the leisure at his disposal to ascertain the true facts of that period before the war, would present to the world a history so interesting and fascinating that he would be accused of having indulged in fiction in his narrative of events. It would be out of place in this book, however, to enter into these historical events, and we must confine ourselves to the details of the period with which this story deals.  Ever since the beginning of the war it was the intention of the Republican Government to defend both Pretoria and Johannesburg, and had the outbreak of the war not been precipitated, and the necessary cannon ordered from France arrived in time, this would have been done. Even after the fall of Bloemfontein the idea was not entirely abandoned, and Commandant Krause was instructed to provision the Johannesburg Fort and make other necessary preparations. A promise was made that several cannon would be left at Johannesburg by the Boers during their retreat. It was hoped that such defence would retard the British advance and enable the Boers to recover from the panic which had seized them ever since the surrender of Cronj√© at Paardeberg.  When, however, General Botha on Tuesday, May 29th, 1900, passed through Johannesburg, Commandant Krause was ordered to abandon the defence of the town, to distribute all provisions collected amongst the families of the men on commando, and to get rid of all men capable of fighting. These orders were promptly carried out.  On the following day, Wednesday, May 30th, between ten and eleven in the morning, Major Francis Davis appeared with a flag of truce and requested to see Dr. Krause.  At the time the Commandant was at the fort attending to General Grobelaar and about 500 men who were retreating in the direction of Pretoria. During the day bodies of armed burghers were continually passing through the town.  On arrival at his office Dr. Krause found Major Davis in the company of two old Johannesburg residents. The latter were dressed in mufti. Both these men had taken an active part in the agitation which preceded the war.  Major Davis in soldierly manner addressed Dr. Krause by saying that he was commanded by Lord Roberts to demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the town, in the name of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.  Dr. Krause's reply was very short: \"No, sir, not immediately and not unconditionally.\"  Major Davis thereupon said that Lord Roberts had also expressed a desire that the Commandant should grant him an interview, at which the matter could be discussed. Dr. Krause assented to this proposition.  What the Boers wanted was delay--and if Commandant Krause could delay the forward advance of the British troops a great advantage would be gained.  Lord Roberts was encamped just above the Victoria Lake, close to Germiston. On arrival at the camp Dr. Krause was met by Lord Roberts on the verandah of the house occupied by him and his staff.  A private interview then took place between the two officers, at which the terms of surrender of Johannesburg were agreed upon, and which will be found in the letter set out hereunder.  The chief reason for an armistice advanced by the Boer Commandant was that if the British were at once to enter the town, street-fighting would undoubtedly take place, as the many armed burghers passing through the town would only obey the orders of their own respective Commandants and Field-cornets. Such street-fighting would be a serious menace to the women and children and to the other peaceful citizens of the town. Lord Roberts agreed to this, adding that he had once, in Afghanistan, experienced street-fighting and would not like to see it again.  Another incident of this interview is worth recording, viz. the protest made by Dr. Krause at the presence of the two civilians who accompanied Major Davis. Lord Roberts asked for the reason of this protest, and was informed that, according to the view of the people in Johannesburg, these men, through the part they played in the mendacious political agitation which was carried on prior to the war, were partly responsible for the war, and further that he (Dr. Krause) had in his possession a warrant for the arrest of one of these men for high treason, issued prior to the commencement of hostilities, and consequently their presence in the town was looked upon with a great deal of disfavour and resentment.  Lord Roberts expressed his regret, and said that these men had accompanied his officer only because he was told that they would be excellent guides, knowing the locality and the officials.  The terms of surrender were agreed to, including an armistice of twenty-four hours. This delay undoubtedly helped to save the Republican forces from utter destruction and certainly enabled General Botha and the other Boer officers to retreat with their men beyond Pretoria and to collect their scattered forces.  Dr. Krause returned to Johannesburg after this interview and immediately set about making the necessary arrangements to carry out his part of the bargain. A Proclamation was issued, calling upon all armed burghers and other capable men to leave the town; all officials were ordered to be in readiness the next day at the respective offices, for the purpose of handing over their administration to their successors.  Early the next morning Mr. William Shawe, the Deputy Sheriff, was dispatched to Lord Roberts, with a formal letter, confirming the terms of surrender agreed to at the above interview. This historical document is, I believe, here printed for the first time and reads as follows:                                               \"JOHANNESBURG,                                                  \"_May 30th, 1900._     \"Lord Roberts,         \"Commander-in-Chief of Her  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],["title","The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#5)"],["body","         \"Majesty's troops in South Africa.      \"YOUR LORDSHIP,      \"Referring to the verbal interview I had with Your Lordship this     morning, with reference to the surrender of the town,     Johannesburg, I now wish to confirm the following in writing:      \"(a) That all officials and other Government employees will be     treated with the necessary respect and consideration. On their     behalf I can give Your Lordship the assurance, that until the     surrender is complete, everything will be done by them to     facilitate Your Lordship's work, in so far as their honour     allows.      \"(b) With reference to the protection of women and children     (including the women and children of Burghers on     Commando),--that these persons will not be molested by the     troops,--Your Lordship having already given the necessary     instructions in this connection.      \"(c) That property will be protected, also forage, except in so     far as military requirements necessitate it.      \"(d) That as regards the 13,000 Kaffirs still on the mines, the     necessary precautions will be taken by Your Lordship:--in this     respect the Special Mine Police corps, till now under my     command, will render Your Lordship all assistance.      \"(e) Enclosed I send Your Lordship a copy of a notice     distributed by me, which speaks for itself, and from which Your     Lordship will learn that all fighting and armed burghers have     been ordered to leave the town at once.      \"(f) It grieves me to have to inform Your Lordship, that     notwithstanding our arrangement, that no armed men would enter     the town till to-morrow at 10 o'clock, several armed persons     entered the town (evidently without Your Lordship's knowledge,     and contrary to instructions), and several of whom are under     arrest; one who attempted to disarm a burgher was wounded, and     is at present in the hospital here.      \"Finally, I must request Your Lordship not to enter the town     with too great a force (for reasons already communicated to Your     Lordship). I shall send some one who will conduct Your Lordship     personally (or the officer in command) to the Government offices     to there carry out and complete the necessary formalities of     handing over the town. All chief and other officials have been     notified by me of this arrangement, and they have been ordered     to hold themselves in readiness to hand over their offices to     the persons appointed thereto.              \"I have the honour to be,                 \"Respectfully yours,                     \"(Signed) F.E.T. KRAUSE.                         \"Acting Special Commandant.\"      On the morning of May 31st, 1900, the sun rose in his bright winter splendour--the sky was blue, and not a cloud appeared upon the horizon. Mother Nature seemed to emphasise the darkness and bitterness in the hearts of the staunch and free Republicans by her dazzling brightness. The new era had dawned, heralding the victory of the invading forces and giving practical proof of the old adage, \"Might is right.\"  At about 10 o'clock Commandant Krause received a message from Lord Roberts announcing his presence on the outskirts of the town (at Denver) and expressing a desire that the Commandant should personally come and meet and conduct him to the Government offices, there to hand over the \"keys\" of the city. This request was complied with. The British were then seen entering the town, headed by Lord Roberts, Lord Kitchener, and Commandant Krause. On arrival at the Government offices the different officials were presented to Lord Roberts, who requested them to remain in office until they were relieved of their duties by an English officer.  The surrender of the Golden City was an accomplished fact!      [Illustration: THE SURRENDER OF THE GOLDEN CITY]  In conclusion, and as a contrast to this terrible period for the Republicans, I may here be permitted to publish a letter written by Lord Roberts to Dr. Krause, which will show in what manner the Golden City was previously administrated and afterwards handed over to the British troops on May 31st, 1900.                                    \"ARMY HEAD-QUARTERS,                                      \"JOHANNESBURG,                                          \"_June 2nd, 1900._      \"DEAR DR. KRAUSE,      \"I desire to express to you how fully I appreciate the valuable     assistance you have afforded me in connection with the entry     into this town of the force under my command.      \"I recognise that you have had DIFFICULTIES OF NO ORDINARY     NATURE TO CONTEND WITH OF LATE, and any weakness in the     administration of the town and suburbs at such a juncture would     doubtless have been taken full advantage of by the disorderly     element which necessarily exists in an important mining     community. THANKS TO YOUR ENERGY AND VIGILANCE, ORDER AND     TRANQUILLITY HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, and I congratulate you     heartily on the result of your labours.      \"Permit me also to tender to you my personal thanks for the     great courtesy you have shown me since I first had the pleasure     of meeting you.                      \"Believe me to be,                         \"Yours truly,                             \"ROBERTS, F.M.\"        CHAPTER IV  MARTIAL LAW UNDER THE ENEMY   After her brothers' departure, described in Chapter I, Hansie fastened her \"Vierkleur,\" a broad band of the Transvaal colours, round her hat, and announced her intention of going into town to see the British troops come in.  Her mother thought it a most unseemly proceeding, and declined to accompany her wilful daughter, but the latter did not wish to miss what she knew would become an historical event of great importance, and rode away on her bicycle, accompanied by her faithful retriever, Carlo.  The thought of the conspicuous band of ribbon round her hat, in green, red, white, and blue, gave her a certain feeling of comfort and satisfaction.  At least none of the friends she might chance to meet that day could suspect her of being in town to _welcome_ the enemy.  The air was charged with the electricity of an excitement so tense, so suppressed, that it struck her like some living force as she rode through the thronged, though silent streets.  In the heart of the town, as she neared Government Square, a change was noticeable--a change that she could not define until it was borne in upon her that it originated in the attitude of the black and coloured part of the community.  They had come out in their thousands--the streets literally seethed with them, the remarkable part of this being that they were all on the pavements, while their \"white brothers\" walked in the middle of the road.  For the sake of the uninitiated I must explain that under the Boer regime no black or coloured person was allowed on the pavements, nor to be out at night, nor to walk about without a registered pass. There was no \"black peril\" then.  This noisy, unlawful demonstration was an expression of joy on their part at the prospect of that day being set free from Boer restrictions, a short-lived joy, however, for they became so lawless and overbearing that it was found necessary, within a very few days, to re-enforce the Boer laws and regulations.         *       *       *       *       *  In perfect order, but weary unto death, the British troops marched in. Thousands and thousands of soldiers in khaki, travel-stained, footsore, and famished, sank to the ground, at a given command, in the open square facing Government Buildings.  Some of them tried to eat of the rations they had with them, others, too exhausted to eat, fell into a deep sleep almost at once, and one old warrior, looking up into the face of the girl standing above him, said, in a broken voice, \"Thank God, the war is over.\"  Hansie bent towards him and answered, in a voice vibrating with passionate feeling, \"Tommy Atkins, _the war has just begun_.\"  He looked at her in puzzled surprise, and sighing heavily, closed his eyes.  Ah, unknown soldier, did you in after years, I wonder, remember the prophetic words spoken by the lips of a girl that day?  At three o'clock that afternoon the Union Jack was hoisted on Government Buildings!  Those of my readers whose love of home, kindred, traditions, ideals--patriotism--belong to other countries can draw a mental picture of what a similar experience would mean to them. One day to be full of hope that a beloved country and independence would be restored to its people, the next with those hopes laid low in the dust, shattered, destroyed for ever, by the sight of a small, unfamiliar flag standing out against the blue sky.  In time of great shock or crisis, merciful Providence numbs our keenest sensibilities and the brain acts and thinks mechanically. The inevitable comes, however, and we wonder at finding ourselves still breathing, after passing through that fire of mental agony.  Our young patriot's heart was torn and bleeding, but her sufferings then were as nothing compared to those she endured in later months and years, when the incidents of that winter's day would pass in review across her brain, haunting her sleeping and waking thoughts like some hideous nightmare.  It is not for me to describe the scene: the cheering of the multitude, the parade of haggard troops--the soul-sickening display of imperial patriotism.  As if ashamed of having witnessed it, the sun, suddenly grown old and grey, hid himself behind a passing cloud, and in the shadows which enveloped her the girl seemed to feel the hand of Nature, groping for hers, to convey its silent message of sympathy.  The crowds dispersed and the troops withdrew to the outskirts of the town to pitch their tents for the night.  When Hansie arrived at Harmony she found all the open space around it occupied by troops, and camps erected at the very gates, while, all along the roads and railway lines, fires were burning and soldiers were engaged in tending their"]]]
