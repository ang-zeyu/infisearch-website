Mor._ Thou proud disturber of thy country's peace,    Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,    Base flatterer, yield! and, were it not for shame,    Shame and dishonour to a soldier's name,    Upon my weapon's point here shouldst thou fall,    And welter in thy gore. _Lan._ Monster of men,    That, like the Greekish strumpet, train'd to arms    And bloody wars so many valiant knights,    Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!    King Edward is not here to buckler thee. _War._ Lancaster, why talk'st thou to the slave?--    Go, soldiers, take him hence; for, by my sword,    His head shall off.--Gaveston, short warning    Shall serve thy turn: it is our country's cause    That here severely we will execute    Upon thy person.--Hang him at a bough. _Gav._ My lord,-- _War._ Soldiers, have him away.--    But, for thou wert the favourite of a king,    Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands. _Gav._ I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive    That heading is one, and hanging is the other,    And death is all.                      _Enter_ ARUNDEL.  _Lan._ How now, my Lord of Arundel! _Arun._ My lords, King Edward greets you all by me. _War._ Arundel, say your message. _Arun._ His majesty, hearing that you had taken Gaveston,    Entreateth you by me, yet but he may    See him before he dies; for why, he says,    And sends you word, he knows that die he shall;    And, if you gratify his grace so far,    He will be mindful of the courtesy. _War._ How now! _Gav._ Renowmed Edward, how thy name    Revives poor Gaveston! _War._ No, it needeth not:    Arundel, we will gratify the king    In other matters; he must pardon us in this.--    Soldiers, away with him! _Gav._ Why, my Lord of Warwick,    Will now these short delays beget my hopes?    I know it, lords, it is life you aim at,    Yet grant King Edward this. _Y. Mor._ Shalt thou appoint    What we shall grant?--Soldiers, away with him!--    Thus we'll gratify the king;    We'll send his head by thee; let him bestow    His tears on that, for that is all he gets    Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk. _Lan._ Not so, my lord, lest he bestow more cost    In burying him than he hath ever earn'd. _Arun._ My lords, it is his majesty's request,    And in the honour of a king he swears,    He will but talk with him, and send him back. _War._ When, can you tell?  Arundel, no; we wot    He that the care of his realm remits,    And drives his nobles to these exigents    For Gaveston, will, if he seize him once,    Violate any promise to possess him. _Arun._ Then, if you will not trust his grace in keep,    My lords, I will be pledge for his return. _Y. Mor._ 'Tis honourable in thee to offer this;    But, for we know thou art a noble gentleman,    We will not wrong thee so,    To make away a true man for a thief. _Gav._ How mean'st thou, Mortimer? that is over-base. _Y. Mor._ Away, base groom, robber of king's renown!    Question with thy companions and mates. _Pem._ My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,    To gratify the king's request therein,    Touching the sending of this Gaveston,    Because his majesty so earnestly    Desires to see the man before his death,    I will upon mine honour undertake    To carry him, and bring him back again;    Provided this, that you, my Lord of Arundel,    Will join with me. _War._ Pembroke, what wilt thou do?    Cause yet more bloodshed? is it not enough    That we have taken him, but must we now    Leave him on \"Had I wist,\" and let him go? _Pem._ My lords, I will not over-woo your honours:    But, if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,    Upon mine oath, I will return him back. _Arun._ My Lord of Lancaster, what say you in this? _Lan._ Why, I say, let him go on Pembroke's word. _Pem._ And you, Lord Mortimer? _Y. Mor._ How say you, my Lord of Warwick? _War._ Nay, do your pleasures: I know how 'twill prove. _Pem._ Then give him me. _Gav._ Sweet sovereign, yet I come    To see thee ere I die! _War._ Yet not perhaps,    If Warwick's wit and policy prevail.                         [_Aside._ _Y. Mor._ My Lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you:    Return him on your honour.--Sound, away!                    [_Exeunt all except Pembroke, Arundel, Gaveston, James                        and other attendants of Pembroke._ _Pem._ My lord, you shall go with me:    My house is not far hence; out of the way    A little; but our men shall go along.    We that have pretty wenches to our wives,    Sir, must not come so near to balk their lips. _Arun._ 'Tis very kindly spoke, my Lord of Pembroke:    Your honour hath an adamant of power    To draw a prince. _Pem._ So, my lord.--Come hither, James:    I do commit this Gaveston to thee;    Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning    We will discharge thee of thy charge: be gone. _Gav._ Unhappy Gaveston, whither go'st thou now?                      [_Exit with James and other Attendants of Pembroke._ _Horse-boy._ My lord, we'll quickly be at Cobham.              [_Exeunt._    _Enter_ GAVESTON _mourning,_ JAMES _and other_ Attendants                         _of_ PEMBROKE.  _Gav._ O treacherous Warwick, thus to wrong thy friend! _James._ I see it is your life these arms pursue. _Gav._ Weaponless must I fall, and die in bands?    O, must this day be period of my life,    Centre of all my bliss?  And ye be men,    Speed to the king.               _Enter_ WARWICK _and_ Soldiers.  _War._ My Lord of Pembroke's men,    Strive you no longer: I will have that Gaveston. _James._ Your lordship doth dishonour to yourself,    And wrong our lord, your honourable friend. _War._ No, James, it is my country's cause I follow.--    Go, take the villain: soldiers, come away;    We'll make quick work.--Commend me to your master,    My friend, and tell him that I watch'd it well.--    Come, let thy shadow parley with King Edward. _Gav._ Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king? _War._ The king of heaven perhaps, no other king.--    Away!                    [_Exeunt Warwick and Soldiers with Gaveston._ _James._ Come, fellows: it booted not for us to strive:    We will in haste go certify our lord.                       [_Exeunt._  _Enter_ KING EDWARD, _the younger_ SPENSER, BALDOCK, Noblemen   _of the king's side, and_ Soldiers _with drums and fifes._  _K. Edw._ I long to hear an answer from the barons    Touching my friend, my dearest Gaveston.    Ah, Spenser, not the riches of my realm    Can ransom him! ah, he is mark'd to die!    I know the malice of the younger Mortimer;    Warwick I know is rough, and Lancaster    Inexorable; and I shall never see    My lovely Pierce of Gaveston again:    The barons overbear with me their pride. _Y. Spen._ Were I King Edward, England's sovereign,    Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain,    Great Edward Longshanks' issue, would I bear    These braves, this rage, and suffer uncontroll'd    These barons thus to beard me in my land,    In mine own realm?  My lord, pardon my speech:    Did you retain your father's magnanimity,    Did you regard the honour of your name,    You would not suffer thus your majesty    Be counterbuff'd of your nobility.    Strike off their heads, and let them preach on poles:    No doubt, such lessons they will teach the rest,    As by their preachments they will profit much,    And learn obedience to their lawful king. _K. Edw._ Yes, gentle Spenser, we have been too mild,    Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword,    And, if they send me not my Gaveston,    We'll steel it on their crest[s], and poll their tops. _Bald._ This haught resolve becomes your majesty,    Not to be tied to their affection,    As though your highness were a school-boy still,    And must be aw'd and govern'd like a child.      _Enter the elder_ SPENSER _with his truncheon, and_                        Soldiers.  _E. Spen._ Long live my sovereign, the noble Edward,    In peace triumphant, fortunate in wars! _K. Edw._ Welcome, old man: com'st thou in Edward's aid?    Then tell thy prince of whence and what thou art. _E. Spen._ Low, with a band of bow-men and of pikes,    Brown bills and targeteers, four hundred strong,    Sworn to defend King Edward's royal right,    I come in person to your majesty,    Spenser, the father of Hugh Spenser there,    Bound to your highness everlastingly    For favour done, in him, unto us all. _K. Edw._ Thy father, Spenser? _Y. Spen._ True, an it like your grace,    That pours, in lieu of all your goodness shown,    His life, my lord, before your princely feet. _K. Edw._ Welcome ten thousand times, old man, again!    Spenser, this love, this kindness to thy king,    Argues thy noble mind and disposition.    Spenser, I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire,    And daily will enrich thee with our favour,    That, as the sunshine, shall reflect o'er thee.    Beside, the more to manifest our love,    Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land,    And that the Mortimers are in hand withal,    Thou shalt have crowns of us t'outbid the barons;    And, Spenser, spare them not, lay it on.--    Soldiers, a largess, and thrice-welcome all! _Y. Spen._ My lord, here comes the queen.       _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, PRINCE EDWARD, _and_                        LEVUNE.  _K. Edw._ Madam, what news? _Q. Isab._ News of dishonour, lord, and discontent.    Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust,    Informeth us, by letters and by words,    That Lord Valois our brother, King of France,    Because your highness hath been slack in homage,    Hath seized Normandy into his hands:    These be the letters, this the messenger. _K. Edw._ Welcome, Levune.--Tush, Sib, if this be all,    Valois and I will soon be friends again.--    But to my Gaveston: shall I never see,    Never behold thee now!--Madam, in this matter    We will employ you and your little son;    You shall go parley with the King of France.--    Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king,    And do your message with a majesty. _P. Edw._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20288"],["title","Edward the Second (#7)"],["body","not to my youth things of more weight    Than fits a prince so young as I to bear;    And fear not, lord and father,--heaven's great beams    On Atlas' shoulder shall not lie more safe    Than shall your charge committed to my trust. _Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, this towardness makes thy mother fear    Thou art not mark'd to many days on earth! _K. Edw._ Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp'd,    And this our son; Levune shall follow you    With all the haste we can despatch him hence.    Choose of our lords to bear you company;    And go in peace; leave us in wars at home. _Q. Isab._ Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king:    God end them once!--My lord, I take my leave,    To make my preparation for France.         [_Exit with Prince Edward._                     _Enter_ ARUNDEL.  _K. Edw._ What, Lord Arundel, dost thou come alone? _Arun._ Yea, my good lord, for Gaveston is dead. _K. Edw._ Ah, traitors, have they put my friend to death?    Tell me, Arundel, died he ere thou cam'st,    Or didst thou see my friend to take his death? _Arun._ Neither, my lord; for, as he was surpris'd,    Begirt with weapons and with enemies round,    I did your highness' message to them all,    Demanding him of them, entreating rather,    And said, upon the honour of my name,    That I would undertake to carry him    Unto your highness, and to bring him back. _K. Edw._ And, tell me, would the rebels deny me that? _Y. Spen._ Proud recreants! _K. Edw._ Yea, Spenser, traitors all! _Arun._ In found them at the first inexorable;    The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing,    Mortimer hardly; Pembroke and Lancaster    Spake least; and when they flatly had denied,    Refusing to receive me pledge for him,    The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake;    \"My lord, because our sovereign sends for him,    And promiseth he shall be safe return'd,    I will this undertake, to have him hence,    And see him re-deliver'd to your hands.\" _K. Edw._ Well, and how fortunes [it] that he came not? _Y. Spen._ Some treason or some villany was cause. _Arun._ The Earl of Warwick seiz'd him on his way;    For, being deliver'd unto Pembroke's men,    Their lord rode home, thinking his prisoner safe;    But, ere he came, Warwick in ambush lay,    And bare him to his death; and in a trench    Strake off his head, and march'd unto the camp. _Y. Spen._ A bloody part, flatly 'gainst law of arms! _K. Edw._ O, shall I speak, or shall I sigh and die! _Y. Spen._ My lord, refer your vengeance to the sword    Upon these barons; hearten up your men;    Let them not unreveng'd murder your friends:    Advance your standard, Edward, in the field,    And march to fire them from their starting-holes. _K. Edw._ [_kneeling._] By earth, the common mother of us all,    By heaven, and all the moving orbs thereof,    By this right hand, and by my father's sword,    And all the honours 'longing to my crown,    I will have heads and lives for him as many    As I have manors, castles, towns, and towers!--              [_Rises._    Treacherous Warwick! traitorous Mortimer!    If I be England's king, in lakes of gore    Your headless trunks, your bodies will I trail,    That you may drink your fill, and quaff in blood,    And stain my royal standard with the same,    That so my bloody colours may suggest    Remembrance of revenge immortally    On your accursed traitorous progeny,    You villains that have slain my Gaveston!--    And in this place of honour and of trust,    Spenser, sweet Spenser, I adopt thee here;    And merely of our love we do create thee    Earl of Glocester and Lord Chamberlain,    Despite of times, despite of enemies. _Y. Spen._ My lord, here's a messenger from the barons    Desires access unto your majesty. _K. Edw._ Admit him near.               _Enter_ Herald _with his coat of arms._  _Her._ Long live King Edward, England's lawful lord! _K. Edw._ So wish not they, I wis, that sent thee hither:    Thou com'st from Mortimer and his complices:    A ranker rout of rebels never was.    Well, say thy message. _Her._ The barons, up in arms, by me salute    Your highness with long life and happiness;    And bid me say, as plainer to your grace,    That if without effusion of blood    You will this grief have ease and remedy,    That from your princely person you remove    This Spenser, as a putrifying branch    That deads the royal vine, whose golden leaves    Empale your princely head, your diadem;    Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim,    Say they, and lovingly advise your grace    To cherish virtue and nobility,    And have old servitors in high esteem,    And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers:    This granted, they, their honours, and their lives,    Are to your highness vow'd and consecrate. _Y. Spen._ Ah, traitors, will they still display their pride? _K. Edw._ Away! tarry no answer, but be gone!--    Rebels, will they appoint their sovereign    His sports, his pleasures, and his company?--    Yet, ere thou go, see how I do divorce      [_Embraces young Spenser._    Spenser from thee.  Now get thee to thy lords,    And tell them I will come to chastise them    For murdering Gaveston: hie thee, get thee gone!    Edward, with fire and sword, follows at thy heels.     [_Exit Herald._    My lord[s], perceive you how these rebels swell?--    Soldiers, good hearts! defend your sovereign's right,    For, now, even now, we march to make them stoop.    Away!                        [_Exeunt. Alarums, excursions, a great fight, and a                             retreat sounded, within._     _Re-enter_ KING EDWARD, _the elder_ SPENSER, _the younger_      SPENSER, BALDOCK, _and_ Noblemen _of the king's side._  _K. Edw._ Why do we sound retreat? upon them, lords!    This day I shall your vengeance with my sword    On those proud rebels that are up in arms,    And do confront and countermand their king. _Y. Spen._ I doubt it not, my lord; right will prevail. _E. Spen._ 'Tis not amiss, my liege, for either part    To breathe a while; our men, with sweat and dust    All chok'd well near, begin to faint for heat;    And this retire refresheth horse and man. _Y. Spen._ Here come the rebels.     _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER, LANCASTER, WARWICK,                  PEMBROKE, _and others._  _Y. Mor._ Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward    Among his flatterers. _Lan._And there let him be,    Till he pay dearly for their company. _War._ And shall, or Warwick's sword shall smite in vain. _K. Edw._ What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat? _Y. Mor._ No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly. _Lan._ They'd best betimes forsake thee and their trains,    For they'll betray thee, traitors as they are. _Y. Spen._ Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster! _Pem._ Away, base upstart! brav'st thou nobles thus? _E. Spen._ A noble attempt and honourable deed,    Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid    And levy arms against your lawful king? _K. Edw._ For which, ere long, their heads shall satisfy    T' appease the wrath of their offended king. _Y. Mor._ Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last,    And rather bathe thy sword in subjects' blood    Than banish that pernicious company? _K. Edw._ Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav'd,    Make England's civil towns huge heaps of stones,    And ploughs to go about our palace-gates. _War._ A desperate and unnatural resolution!--    Alarum to the fight!    Saint George for England, and the barons' right! _K. Edw._ Saint George for England, and King Edward's right!                            [_Alarums.  Exeunt the two parties severally._     _Enter_ KING EDWARD _and his followers, with the_ Barons                      _and_ KENT _captive._  _K. Edw._ Now, lusty lords, now not by chance of war,    But justice of the quarrel and the cause,    Vail'd is your pride: methinks you hang the heads    But we'll advance them, traitors: now 'tis time    To be aveng'd on you for all your braves,    And for the murder of my dearest friend,    To whom right well you knew our soul was knit,    Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite:    Ah, rebels, recreants, you made him away! _Kent._ Brother, in regard of thee and of thy land,    Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne. _K. Edw._ So, sir, you have spoke: away, avoid our presence!                                                             [_Exit Kent._    Accursed wretches, was't in regard of us,    When we had sent our messenger to request    He might be spar'd to come to speak with us,    And Pembroke undertook for his return,    That thou, proud Warwick, watch'd the prisoner,    Poor Pierce, and headed him 'gainst law of arms?    For which thy head shall overlook the rest    As much as thou in rage outwent'st the rest. _War._ Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces;    It is but temporal that thou canst inflict. _Lan._ The worst is death; and better die to live    Than live in infamy under such a king. _K. Edw._ Away with them, my lord of Winchester!    These lusty leaders, Warwick and Lancaster,    I charge you roundly, off with both their heads!    Away! _War._ Farewell, vain world! _Lan._ Sweet Mortimer, farewell! _Y. Mor._ England, unkind to thy nobility,    Groan for this grief! behold how thou art maim'd! _K. Edw._ Go, take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower;    There see him safe bestow'd; and, for the rest,    Do speedy execution on them all.    Be gone! _Y. Mor._ What, Mortimer, can ragged stony walls    Immure thy virtue that aspires to heaven?    No, Edward, England's scourge, it may not be;    Mortimer's hope surmounts his fortune far.                                        [_The captive Barons are led off._ _K. Edw._ Sound, drums and trumpets!  March with me, my friends.    Edward this day hath crown'd him king anew.

Spen._ Levune, the trust that we repose in thee    Begets the quiet of King Edward's land:    "]]]
