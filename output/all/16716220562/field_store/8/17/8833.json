Barbarous old beast.\"  \"Now,\" said Captain Deering, \"tuck in your tuppenny, Mr. Figgins; bow as low as you can.\"  The orphan put his back into an angle of forty-five with his legs.  \"Lower.\"  \"Ugh!\"  \"A little bit more.\"  \"Lower,\" said Captain Deering, in an agonised whisper. \"We shall all be bowstrung if his excellency thinks us wanting in respect.\"  The orphan thus admonished made a further effort, and over he went  Head first!  There was such a chattering, such horrible sounds going on, as Captain Deering scrambled after the unfortunate orphan, that the latter thought his time was come.  The captain dragged him to his feet, however.  Then the presentation was proceeded with.  \"His Excellency Ali Kungham Ben Nardbake,\" cried a dignitary standing beside the pasha, with a voice like a toastmaster.  \"Good gracious me!\" exclaimed the orphan, \"all that?\"  \"That's not half of it,\" said Captain Deering. \"To the faithful, he is known as well as Sid Ney Ali Ben Lesters puar Nasr ed Bowstrung and Strattford Bustum.\"  Mr. Figgins was greatly alarmed at this.  \"Powerful memories his godfathers and godmothers must have had,\" he murmured.  Beside the pasha stood an official, with a beard of extraordinary length.  \"Who's that?\"  \"Hush?\" whispered Deering; \"don't speak so loud.\"  \"Who is he?\" again asked the orphan, sinking his voice.  \"The one with the beard?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"His name is Whiska Said Mahmoud Ben Ross Latreille,\" returned Deering.  \"Dear, dear!\" murmured the orphan, in despairing accents, \"I shall never----\"  \"Ease her, stop her!\" cried a familiar voice in Mr. Figgins's ear, \"you've got it in a knot.\"  It was Nat Cringle.  All was hushed.  The bearded official looked at the pasha, who nodded.  Then drawing his sword, he signed to two of his men, and Nat Cringle, looking dreadfully frightened, was bustled off behind a curtain which had been rigged up across the saloon, just at the pasha's back.  \"What are they going to do?\" asked the orphan, his teeth chattering in alarm.  Captain Deering was so much affected at this stage of the proceedings that he covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief.  \"Poor Nat!\"  \"What is it?\" faltered Mr. Figgins, faintly.  \"Did you not see the cord taken away with Nat?\" demanded the captain, in a funereal bass.  \"Ye-es.\"  \"Then hark.\"  Mr. Figgins did hark, and an awful sound reached him from behind the curtain.  It was more like the expiring groans of a hapless porker in the hands of a ruthless butcher, than any thing else you could compare it to.  A fatal struggle was going on behind the curtain.  Groans and dying wails were heard for awhile.  Awful sounds.  Then all was still.  \"Oh, what is it?\" murmured the orphan, in distress.  \"Squiziz Wizen, the pasha's executioner, has dealt upon poor Nat Cringle.\"  \"What!\" gasped Figgins.  \"Bowstrung,\" returned Captain Deering.  The orphan turned faint.  Then he turned to the door, and would have fled.  \"Oh, let me go home,\" he cried. \"I don't feel happy here.\"  But Deering stayed him.  \"You must not go, Mr. Figgins,\" whispered Captain Deering.  \"Why not?\"  \"His excellency is about to address us.\"  The pasha coughed.  \"_Quel est votre jeu?_\" demanded his excellency.  \"What does he say?\" asked Figgins.  \"Batta pudn,\" continued his excellency, with a gracious air; \"also bono Jonni.\"  \"He says you may present whatever you have brought,\" whispered the captain.  \"I've brought nothing,\" returned Mr. Figgins.  \"Nothing?\"  \"No; I forgot.\"  \"Thoughtless man,\" said Captain Deering. \"Take this.\"  He thrust a parcel of brown paper into his hands.  \"What shall I do with it?\"  \"Place it on the cushion before his excellency.\"  Mr. Figgins complied.  \"Luciousosity,\" said the pasha, looking upon the offering greedily.  Then he clapped his hands vigorously three times.  The minister appeared, leading two veiled ladies.  The pasha made some remarks in his own language, which Captain Deering was commissioned to render into English.  \"His excellency, recognising your generous offering,\" said he, \"presents you with the choicest gifts of his seraglio, two wives. You must cherish them through life.\"  The orphan's countenance fell at this.  The capital punishment of poor Nat Cringle was as nothing to this.  \"Tell him I'd rather not take two,\" he whispered to Deering.  \"Why not?\" ejaculated the latter.  \"I wish to live single.\"  The bearded minister approached, leading the two veiled beauties.  \"Oh! oh, dear,\" groaned the poor orphan.  He placed a gloved hand of each upon Mr. Figgins's shoulders.  Then, upon a given signal, they threw their arms around the orphan and hugged him, while a violent cachinnation was heard.  \"What a lovely smile,\" said Captain Deering. \"Did you hear it?\"  \"Oh! Please don't,\" cried the orphan.  He struggled to get free.  But the beauties of the seraglio held him tight.  The orphan grew desperate, and jerked himself out of their clutches.  But in the tussle down he flopped on the ground again.  \"Infidel dog!\" roared the pasha, venting his wrath in English, \"barbarian and idolater, thou shalt die!\"  Thereupon, Captain Deering dropped down beside the orphan, and sued for mercy.  \"Be merciful, O great prince!\" he cried. \"Have pity on your humblest slave. His heart is filled with gratitude.\"  The pasha growled some reply that was indistinct, but which to the startled Figgins, sounded like the rumbling of distant thunder.  \"Oh, what shall I do?\" moaned the orphan. \"Oh, somebody take me home.\"  \"Silence,\" whispered Captain Deering. \"Prostrate yourself as they do. Bury your face and be silent, until his excellency bids you rise. He may then overlook it.\"  Mr. Figgins scarce dared to breathe.  There he lay, with his face upon the ground, humbly awaiting the stern despot's permission to move.                    *          *          *          *  He waited long--very long.  While he waited thus, a strange commotion was observed amongst the pasha's suite.  The chief officer removed his turban and beard, and--wonderful to relate!--beneath it was the laughing face of Harry Girdwood.  He winked at his august master, who hurriedly removed his turban and beard as well.  And then the pasha bore a marvellous resemblance to Jack Harkaway the younger.  They helped to drag off each other's robes--for beneath their Turkish garments were their everyday clothes.  The veiled beauties of the harem were disrobed.  Beneath their veils and feminine attire they were familiarly garbed, and a glance revealed them to be Tinker and his body-guard Bogey.  \"Now then, Mr. Figgins,\" said Nat Cringle, \"wake up.\"  The orphan looked up in amazement at the sound.  \"Nat Cringle!\"  \"Hullo!\"  Mr. Figgins looked about in wonderment.  Facing him was Jack Harkaway, sitting upon a camp stool, and beside him stood his constant companion, Harry Girdwood.  Engaged in conversation with them was Captain Deering, and the subject of their conversation appeared to be the orphan himself.  The Turkish soldiers and people generally forming the pasha's suite had disappeared, and in their places were several sailors, some of whom appeared to be considerably amused at something.  When Mr. Figgins sat up and looked about him, he muttered--  \"What's all this?\"  \"A very serious case, Harry,\" said Jack, gravely.  \"Very.\"  \"A case for the doctor.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"These habits of drinking grow upon one,\" said Harry Girdwood, sadly.  \"I don't understand,\" faltered the orphan.  \"Shall we help you to bed, sir?\" asked one of the sailors compassionately.  \"Never!\" cried Mr. Figgins, with majesty.  \"Oh, yes, do,\" said Harry.  But nerved to desperation, the orphan tore himself away from them, and darted to the door.  \"I shall go and report upon these outrageous doings to the captain of the ship,\" he said, drawing himself up.  \"Here's the captain himself,\" said a good-natured voice behind him. \"And now, what can he do for you, Mr. Figgins?\"  The orphan turned.  There was the captain.  \"Mr. Figgins,\" said the captain, with a serious air, and shaking his forefinger at him, \"you have been indulging very early in the day.\"  \"What?\"  He could endure no more.  With a cry of disgust, he dashed past the captain, and scrambled up the stairs on deck.  Once there, he shot like a race horse along the deck, and gaining his own berth, he locked himself in.  But even here he could not shut out the ringing laughter of the incorrigible practical jokers.  Mr. Figgins, as you may guess, was seen no more that day.                    *          *          *          *  Upon the day following the events just related, Jack received letters from home.  And among them was one which created no little excitement amongst the nearest friends of Jack Harkaway.  \"Do you think it probable that he'll come?\"  \"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Harry Girdwood.  \"I should like to see his dear old face again,\" said Jack.  \"I'll bet a penny that we shall see him here yet; if not here, at least at our next stage,\" said Harry.  \"It would be a rare treat to talk with someone who had seen our dear folks at home.\"  \"It would indeed. I hope he will come.\"  And who did they hope would come?  Can you not guess reader? No.  Then read on, and you will learn who it was and what were the reasons which were to bring a friend from home roaming to this distant shore to meet Jack and his friends.     CHAPTER LXIV.  THE SAPIENT DOCTOR MUGGINS CAME IN HASTE--IMPEDIMENTS IN THE WAY OF THE PRESCRIPTION--DWELLS ON ARTIFICIAL LIMBS--OLD-REMINISCENCES--THE TORMENTOR.   Reader, we will return for a little time to our old friend, Mole, in England.  Mr. Mole was sad.  For so many years of his life had old Isaac Mole led a wandering"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20320"],["title","Jack Harkaway's Boy Tinker Among The Turks (#5)"],["body","eer, that he found it exceedingly difficult, not to say irksome, to settle down to the prosy existence which they had all dropped into.  He never complained, it is true.  But he fell into a sort of settled melancholy, which nothing could shake off, and even grew neglectful of the bottle.  His friends grew anxious.  They wished him to take medical advice.  He resisted all persuasion stoutly.  So they had recourse to artifice, and invited an eminent medical man to their house as a visitor.  And then under the guise of a friendly chat, the doctor took his observations.  But the peculiar ailment, if ailment it could be called, of Isaac Mole, completely baffled the man of science at first.  It was only in a casual conversation that, being an observing man, he discovered the real truth.  \"Our patient wants a roving commission,\" said the physician to himself.  And then he communicated his own convictions to old Jack.  \"I scarcely believe it possible, doctor,\" said Jack.  But the doctor was positive.  \"Nothing will do him any good but to get on the move; I'm as sure of that as I am that he has no physical ailment.\"  \"What's to be done then?\" demanded Harkaway. \"He can't travel alone.\"  \"I don't know that,\" said the doctor; \"he's hale and wiry enough. The only difficulty that I can see, is Mrs. Mole.\"  \"I'll undertake to get over that,\" said Jack.  \"You will?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"It is settled then,\" said the physician, with a smile.  \"Good.\"  \"What would do him more good than all the physic in the world, would be to send him after your son.\"  \"My Jack!\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Impossible. Why, Jack is _en route_ for Turkey.\"  \"What of that?\" coolly inquired the doctor.  \"Consider the distance, my dear doctor.\"  \"Pshaw, sir. Distance is nothing nowadays. It was a very different thing when I was a boy. Take my word for it, Mr. Harkaway, our patient will jump at the chance.\"  \"He's very much attached to my roving boy.\"  \"I know it,\" returned the doctor. \"Never a day passes but he speaks of him; I declare that I never had a single interview with Mr. Mole, but that he has managed somehow to turn the conversation upon your son and his pranks.\"  \"Oh, Jack, he has played him some dreadful tricks.\"  \"Yes,\" returned the physician dryly, \"and so has Jack's father, by all accounts.\"  \"Ahem!\"  \"And yet I really believe that he enjoys the recollection of the boy's infamous practical jokes.\"  \"I believe you are right,\" responded Harkaway.  A day or two later on the doctor was seated with Mr. Mole.  \"Mr. Mole.\"  \"Doctor.\"  \"Your health must be looked to. You'll have to travel.\"  \"How, doctor?\" said Mole.  \"Young Harkaway is in foreign parts, and his prolonged absence causes his parents considerable uneasiness, and you must go and look after him.\"  Mole's eyes twinkled.  \"Do you mean it?\"  \"I do. When would you like to start?\"  \"To-day.\"  \"Very good. The sooner the better,\" said the doctor.  Mr. Mole's countenance fell suddenly.  An ugly thought crossed him.  What would Mrs. Mole say?  \"There is one matter I would like to consult you on, doctor.\"  \"What might that be?\" demanded the doctor.  \"My wife might have a word to say upon the subject.\"  \"I will undertake to remove her scruples,\" said the doctor.  \"You will?\"  \"Yes. She will never object when she knows how important your mission is.\"  \"Doctor,\" exclaimed Mr. Mole, joyously; \"you are a trump.\"  A delay naturally occurred, however.  Mr. Mole could not travel with his wooden stumps, his friends one and all agreed.  No.  He must have a pair of cork legs made.  The doctor who had been attending our old friend knew of a maker of artificial limbs who was a wonderful man, according to all accounts.  \"Yes,\" said Mole, \"cork legs well hosed will----\"  At this moment a voice tuning up under the window cut him short,      \"He gave his own leg to the undertaker,     And sent for a skilful cork-leg maker.                             Ritooral looral.\"  \"That's Dick Harvey. Infamous!\" ejaculated Mr. Mole.      \"On a brace of broomsticks never I'll walk,     But I'll have symmetrical limbs of cork.                             Ritooral looral.\"  \"Monstrous!\" exclaimed Mr. Mole; \"close the window, sir, if you please.\"  It was all very well to say \"Close it,\" but this was easier said than done.  Dick Harvey had fixed it beyond the skill of that skilful mechanician to unfasten.                    *          *          *          *  The aggravating minstrel continued without--      \"Than timber this cork is better by half,     Examine likewise my elegant calf.                             Ritooral looral----\"  \"I will have that window closed,\" cried Mole.  He arose, forgetting in his haste that he was minus one leg, and down he rolled.  The artificial limb-maker lunged after him, and succeeded with infinite difficulty in getting him on to his feet again.  \"Dear, dear!\" said Mr. Mole. \"No matter, I can manage it.\"  He picked up the nearest object to hand, and hurled it out of window.     CHAPTER LXV.  HOW THE ORPHAN BECAME POSSESSED OF A FLUTE.   But we must leave Mole for a time, and return to our friends on their travels.  When next they landed at a Turkish town, Mr. Figgins went to a different hotel to that patronised by young Jack, whose practical joking was rather too much for the orphan.  But they found him out, and paid him a visit one morning.  After the first greeting, Mr. Figgins was observed to be unusually thoughtful.  At length, after a long silence he exclaimed--  \"I can't account for it, I really can't.\"  \"What can't you account for, Mr. Figgins?\" asked young Jack.  \"The strange manners of the people of this country,\" answered the orphan.  \"Of what is it you have to complain particularly?\" inquired Jack.  \"Well, it's this; wherever I go, I seem to be quite an object of curiosity.\"  \"Of interest you mean, Mr. Figgins,\" returned Jack, winking at Harry Girdwood; \"you are an Englishman, you know, and Englishmen are always very interesting to foreigners.\"  \"I can't say as to that,\" the orphan replied; \"I only know I can't show my nose out of doors without being pointed at.\"  \"Ah, yes. You excite interest the moment you make your appearance.\"  \"Then, if I walk in the streets, dark swarthy men stare at me and follow me till I have quite a crowd at my heels.\"  \"Another proof of the interest they take in you.\"  \"Well, I don't like it at all,\" said the orphan, fretfully; \"and then the dogs bark at me in a very distressing manner.\"  \"It's the only way they have of bidding you welcome,\" remarked Harry Girdwood.  \"I wish they wouldn't take any notice of me at all; it's a nuisance.\"  \"Perhaps you'd like them to leave off barking, and take to biting?\"  \"No, it's just what I shouldn't like, but it's what I'm constantly afraid they will do,\" wailed the poor orphan.  There was a slight pause, during which young Jack and his comrade grinned quietly at each other, and presently the former said--  \"I think I can account for all this.\"  \"Can you?\" asked Mr. Figgins. \"How?\"  \"It all lies in the dress you wear.\"  \"In the dress?\"  \"Yes; you are in a Turkish country, and although I admit you look well in your splendid new tourist suit, cross-barred all over in four colours, I fancy it would be better if you dressed as a Turk during your stay here.\"  \"A Turk, Jack?\"  \"Yes; now, if you were to have your head shaved, and dress yourself like a Turk,\" said Jack, \"all this wonderment would cease, and you would go out, and come in, without exciting any remark.\"  Mr. Figgins fell back in his chair.  \"Ha-ha-have my head sha-a-ved, dress myself up li-like a Turk?\" he gasped. \"You surely don't mean that?\"  \"I do, indeed,\" replied Jack, seriously.  \"What? Wear baggy breeches, and an enormous turban, and slippers turned up at the toes! What would the natives say?\"  \"Why, they'd say you were a very sensible individual,\" remarked Harry. \"Don't you remember the old saying?--'When you're in Turkey, you must do as Turkey does.'\"  Mr. Figgins reflected for a moment.  \"And you really think if I were to go in, for a regular Turkish fit-out, I should be allowed to enjoy my walks in peace?\" he asked, at length.  \"Decidedly,\" answered his counsellors, with the utmost gravity.  \"Then I'll take your advice, and be a Turk until further notice,\" said the orphan; \"but there's one thing still.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"My complexion isn't near dark enough for one of these infidels.\"  \"Oh, that won't matter,\" said Jack; \"only slip into the Turkish togs. Go in for any quantity of turban, and they won't care a button about your complexion.\"  \"Very well, then, that's settled; I'll turn Turk at once. But must I have my head shaved?\"  \"That's important,\" said Jack.  Having made up his mind on that point, the orphan at once put on his hat, and taking a sip of brandy to compose his nerves, he sallied forth, directing his steps to the nearest barber's.  On his way thither he attracted the usual amount of attention, and when he reached the barber's shop, he found himself accompanied by a select crowd of deriding Turks, and a dozen or so of yelping curs, shouting and barking in concert.  The barber received him with the extreme of Eastern courtesy.  \"What does the English signor require at the hands of the humblest of his slaves?\" was the deferential inquiry.  \"I have a fancy to turn Turk, and I want my head shaved,\" explained Mr. Figgins, nervously; \"pray be careful, since I'm only a poor orphan, who----\"  Before he had time to finish his sentence, he found himself wedged into a chair with a towel under his chin.  The next moment his head, under the energetic manipulation of the operator, was a creamy mass of lather.  \"Be sure and don't cut my head off,\" murmured the orphan, as he watched the razor flashing to and fro along the strop.  \"Your servant will not disturb the minutest pimple,\" said the barber.  With wonderful celerity, the artist went to work.  In less than two minutes the cranium of Mark Antony Figgins was as smooth and destitute of hair as a bladder of lard.  Then"]]]
