He walked slowly, for he was faint with loss of blood.  After proceeding about a quarter of a mile, he emerged from the wood and came upon a spot where the road forked. Having no clue whatever as to the direction in which Lewes lay, he sat down upon a heap of stones and waited patiently for morning. He had no doubt that the burglary had been a successful one, and he bitterly regretted his neglect to keep a watch down the lane, to see that he was not surprised by the men he had heard were coming. At any rate, he hoped that he should be able to give such information as would set the constables upon the track.  It seemed to him that some three hours passed before a faint light began to dawn in the sky. By this he knew that it must be about half-past six, and calculated, therefore, he must have set out in the trap about half-past one. He now started to walk along the road, hoping that he should soon meet some labourer going to work. Stopping by a small stream which ran across the road, he washed his head and face; as he had lain on the ground after being struck, the blood had not flowed on to his clothes.  After the wash he proceeded with a brisker step. Half an hour later he met a ploughman, riding one of his team to the fields.  \"Is this the road to Lewes?\" Reuben asked.  \"Lewes? Noa, this baint the road to Lewes. I don't know nothing about the road to Lewes. This bee the road to Hastings, if you goes further. So they tell me; I ain't never been there.\"  \"Is there a village anywhere about here?\" Reuben asked.  \"Ay, half a mile or so on.\"  Reuben walked on till he got to the village; and then, going to a public house, obtained some refreshment and learned, from the landlord, the direction he should take to get to the main road leading to Lewes; which was, as he expected, some twenty miles away. He found that the cart had not followed the main road towards London, but had driven by crossroads for a considerable distance, before turning north.  It was late in the afternoon before Reuben arrived at Lewes, for he had been obliged to rest often by the way, and had made but slow progress. When within a few doors of his mother's house, one of the constables of the town came up to him and touched him on the shoulder.  \"I arrest you in the king's name!\"  \"Arrest me! What for?\" Reuben exclaimed.  \"For breaking into the house of Squire Ellison, of Tipping, that's what it's for.\"  Reuben laughed.  \"You have got the wrong man this time. I have no more to do with the burglary than a child.\"  \"It's no laughing matter,\" the constable said. \"If you are innocent you have got to prove it; that ain't no business of mine. All I have got to do is to arrest you.\"  So saying, and before Reuben knew what he was about, he slipped a pair of handcuffs over his wrists. Reuben flushed up. Hitherto he had scarcely taken the matter seriously, but to be marched handcuffed through the streets of Lewes was an indignity which enraged him.  \"Take these off,\" he said angrily. \"I will go quietly with you.\"  \"You may or you may not,\" the man said doggedly. \"You are younger than I am, and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it.\"  Reuben saw that it was of no use to argue and, silent and pale, he walked along by the side of the constable, who retained a tight hold of his collar. A little crowd gathered speedily round, for such a sight was unusual in Lewes; and Reuben felt thankful when they reached the cells, and he was sheltered from the gaze of the public. A minute later the head constable came in.  \"Now, my lad, don't say anything to criminate yourself,\" he began; \"the less you talk, the better for you. I am sorry to see you here, for I knew your father, and I have a good character of you from your employer; so I give you my advice--keep your mouth shut.\"  \"But I am not going to keep my mouth shut,\" Reuben said indignantly. \"Here am I, arrested in the public streets, marched handcuffed through the town upon a most monstrous charge, which has been brought against me without a shadow of evidence.\"  \"Don't be talking, don't be talking,\" the constable said testily; \"you will hear the evidence in time enough.\"  \"But I will talk. I want to tell you what's happened, and you will see that I am innocent, at once.\"  \"Very well, if you will you will; but mind, don't blame me afterwards.\"  Reuben told the story of his adventures from the time of leaving.  \"There,\" he said when he finished, \"isn't that enough to show that I am innocent?\"  \"No,\" the chief constable said gravely, \"it's not enough to prove anything, one way or the other. I am bound to say the story looks a likely one; and if it weren't for two or three matters which I heard of, from the constable who came over from Tipping, I should have no doubt about it. However, all that is for the magistrate to decide. There will be a meeting tomorrow.\"  \"But can't I be taken before a magistrate at once? There's Captain Fidler, within a mile.\"  \"What would be the good?\" the chief constable said. \"You don't suppose anyone would let you out, only on the strength of the story you have told me. He could only remand you, and you could gain nothing by it.\"  \"Can I see my mother?\" Reuben asked next.  \"Yes,\" the constable said, \"I will send her down a message, at once.\"  Mrs. Whitney soon came up. A neighbour had brought her in the news when Reuben had been arrested, and she was on the point of starting to inquire about it when the message arrived. She was more indignant than grieved, when she heard the charge which had been brought against Reuben.  \"The idea of such a thing!\" she exclaimed. \"These constables don't seem to have natural sense. The idea of charging anyone who is known as a respectable young man with such a thing as that, and shutting him up without a question. Why, there can't be any evidence against you.\"  \"There's no saying, mother,\" Reuben replied. \"You mustn't be too sure of that. Don't you remember that affair of the dog? Well, the same hand is at work now. Before, I only suspected who had done it; but I am sure now. However, whatever evidence they may have got, we know it isn't true. I have four years' good character here to speak for me. Still, it is hard that I should get into positions of this sort, without any fault of mine.\"  \"It's better that it is without any fault of yours, Reuben.\"  \"That is right enough, mother, so we will both keep up our spirits.\"    Chapter 4: The Trial.   There were three magistrates on the bench on the following morning, when Reuben was brought up. The justice room was crowded, for the series of burglaries had caused some excitement; and the news that the house of Mr. Ellison had been broken into, and that one of the men who had been taken turned out to belong to Lewes, had created quite a sensation.  Mr. Ellison was the first to give his evidence. He testified that, on waking on the previous morning, he found that someone had been in his room during the night. He was not in the habit of locking his door, and had not been awakened. He found that a box which stood on the dressing table, containing some valuable jewelry, was gone; that his watch and that of Mrs. Ellison had been taken; that the drawers had been opened, and a case containing the more valuable jewels of his wife had also been abstracted. This was not discovered till afterwards. He first missed his watch.  He rang the servants up, for it was still early; and it was then discovered that the lower premises had been broken into, the plate chest in the butler's pantry broken open, and a large quantity of plate stolen.  \"What do you estimate the value of the articles stolen, Mr. Ellison?\"  \"The value of my wife's jewels I should put down, roughly, at two thousand pounds; the silver plate might have been worth three hundred more; the watches and other articles, so far as I yet miss them, say another hundred.\"  The servants proved that they found the kitchen window open, on going downstairs. It had been opened by the catch being forced back. It was not the custom to put up shutters. The pantry door, which was a strong one, had been cut with a saw round the lock. The butler testified to the plate having been safe, the night before, and the strong chest in which it was kept having been forced open.  Directly it was discovered, the constable of the village was placed in charge of the room, with orders to admit no one; and a man on horseback was sent off to Lewes, to the chief constable. The village constable gave evidence as to the state of the place, when he was put in charge.  The constable who had been sent over from Lewes then stepped into the witness box. He testified to the marks of entry of the thieves, and said that the manner in which they had gone to work, and in which the door had been sawn through, and the chest forced open, seemed to show that it was the work of practised hands. On examining closely the butler's pantry, he found a powerful screwdriver and a heavy chisel. These corresponded to marks in the lid, and had evidently been used for the purpose of forcing it open. They had the initials \"R W.\" burnt in the handles. The inmates of the house all denied any knowledge of these tools.  Mr. Ellison had been present when he showed them to Mrs. Ellison. On looking at them she said at once:  \"R. W. Why, that must be Reuben Whitney, that wicked boy, again.\"  Upon making inquiries, he found that the man named worked at Mr. Penfold's, the mill wright at Lewes. He returned there at once and, going to Mr. Penfold, found the prisoner was absent from work. The men identified the brand on the tools as that of the prisoner. Another constable proved the arrest.  The chief constable then read the statement that the prisoner had made to him. The magistrates conferred together for a few minutes, in an undertone.  \"Mrs. Ellison,\" the senior of them said, addressing that lady, who was sitting on a chair placed at the upper end of the court, \"we are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],["title","Scottish Ghost Stories (#0)"],["body","at https://www.pgdp.net              *       *       *       *       *      +-----------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                       |     |                                                           |     | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the original     |     | document has been preserved.                              |     |                                                           |     | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in this  |     | text.

As far as I can recollect, it was somewhat to this effect: \"Comfortable home offered to a gentleman (a bachelor) at moderate terms in an elderly Highland lady's house at Pitlochry. Must be a strict teetotaller and non-smoker. F.M., Box so-and-so.\"  The naïveté and originality of the advertisement pleased me. The idea of obtaining as a boarder a young man combining such virtues as abstinence from alcohol and tobacco amused me vastly. And then a bachelor, too! Did she mean to make love to him herself? The sly old thing! She took care to insert the epithet \"elderly,\" in order to avoid suspicion; and there was no doubt about it--she thirsted for matrimony. Being \"tabooed\" by all the men who had even as much as caught a passing glimpse of her, this was her last resource--she would entrap some unwary stranger, a man with money of course, and inveigle him into marrying her. And there rose up before me visions of a tall, angular, forty-year-old Scottish spinster, with high cheek-bones, virulent, sandy hair, and brawny arms--the sort of woman that ought not to have been a woman at all--the sort that sets all my teeth on edge. Yet it was Pitlochry, heavenly Pitlochry, and there was no one else advertising in that town. That I should suit her in every respect but the matrimonial, I did not doubt. I can pass muster in any company as a teetotaller; I abominate tobacco (leastways it abominates me, which amounts to much about the same thing), and I am, or rather I can be, tolerably amenable, if my surroundings are not positively infernal, and there are no County Council children within shooting distance.  But for once my instincts were all wrong. The advertiser--a Miss Flora Macdonald of \"Donald Murray House\"--did _not_ resemble my preconception of her in any respect. She was of medium height, and dainty build--a fairy-like creature clad in rustling silks, with wavy, white hair, bright, blue eyes, straight, delicate features, and hands, the shape and slenderness of which at once pronounced her a psychic. She greeted me with all the stately courtesy of the Old School; my portmanteau was taken upstairs by a solemn-eyed lad in the Macdonald tartan; and the tea bell rang me down to a most appetising repast of strawberries and cream, scones, and delicious buttered toast. I fell in love with my hostess--it would be sheer sacrilege to designate such a divine creature by the vulgar term of \"landlady\"--at once. When one's impressions of a place are at first exalted, they are often, later on, apt to become equally abased. In this case, however, it was otherwise. My appreciation both of Miss Flora Macdonald and of her house daily increased. The food was all that could be desired, and my bedroom, sweet with the perfume of jasmine and roses, presented such a picture of dainty cleanliness, as awakened in me feelings of shame, that it should be defiled by all my dusty, travel-worn accoutrements. I flatter myself that Miss Macdonald liked me also. That she did not regard me altogether as one of the common herd was doubtless, in some degree, due to the fact that she was a Jacobite; and in a discussion on the associations of her romantic namesake, \"Flora Macdonald,\" with Perthshire, it leaked out that our respective ancestors had commanded battalions in Louis XIV.'s far-famed Scottish and Irish Brigades. That discovery bridged gulfs. We were no longer payer and paid--we were friends--friends for life.  A lump comes into my throat as I pen these words, for it is only a short time since I heard of her death.  A week or so after I had settled in her home, I took, at her suggestion, a rest (and, I quite agree with her, it was a very necessary rest) from my writing, and spent the day on Loch Tay, leaving again for \"Donald Murray House\" at seven o'clock in the evening. It was a brilliant, moonlight night. Not a cloud in the sky, and the landscape stood out almost as clearly as in the daytime. I cycled, and after a hard but thoroughly enjoyable spell of pedalling, eventually came to a standstill on the high road, a mile or two from the first lights of Pitlochry. I halted, not through fatigue, for I was almost as fresh as when I started, but because I was entranced with the delightful atmosphere, and wanted to draw in a few really deep draughts of it before turning into bed. My halting-place was on a triangular plot of grass at the junction of four roads. I propped my machine against a hedge, and stood with my back leaning against a sign-post, and my face in the direction whence I had come. I remained in this attitude for some minutes, probably ten, and was about to remount my bicycle, when I suddenly became icy cold, and a frightful, hideous terror seized and gripped me so hard, that the machine, slipping from my palsied hands, fell to the ground with a crash. The next instant something--for the life of me I knew not what, its outline was so blurred and indefinite--alighted on the open space in front of me with a soft thud, and remained standing as bolt upright as a cylindrical pillar. From afar off, there then came the low rumble of wheels, which momentarily grew in intensity, until there thundered into view a waggon, weighed down beneath a monstrous stack of hay, on the top of which sat a man in a wide-brimmed straw hat, engaged in a deep confabulation with a boy in corduroys who sprawled beside him. The horse, catching sight of the motionless \"thing\" opposite me, at once stood still and snorted violently. The man cried out, \"Hey! hey! What's the matter with ye, beast?\" And then in an hysterical kind of screech, \"Great God! What's yon figure that I see? What's yon figure, Tammas?\"  The boy immediately raised himself into a kneeling position, and, clutching hold of the man's arm, screamed, \"I dinna ken, I dinna ken, Matthew; but take heed, mon, it does na touch me. It's me it's come after, na ye.\"  The moonlight was so strong that the faces of the speakers were revealed to me with extraordinary vividness, and their horrified expressions were even more startling than was the silent, ghastly figure of the Unknown. The scene comes back to me, here, in my little room in Norwood, with its every detail as clearly marked as on the night it was first enacted. The long range of cone-shaped mountains, darkly silhouetted against the silvery sky, and seemingly hushed in gaping expectancy; the shining, scaly surface of some far-off tarn or river, perceptible only at intervals, owing"]]]
