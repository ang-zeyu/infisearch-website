Christ, the Son, the Father spake,                                322 To keep the lamp alive,                                              427 To Thee, great source of light,                                      156 To Thee, my God and Saviour,                                         646 To Thee, my God, my days are known,                                  616 To Thee, my God! to thee I bring,                                    963 'Twas God who fixed the rolling spheres,                             104 'Twas on that dark and doleful night,                                677 Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,                                     546 Upon the gospel's sacred page,                                       296 Vital spark of heavenly flame,                                       542 Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will,                                   628 Walk in the light, so shalt thou know,                               998 Watchman, tell us of the night,                                      200 We bid thee welcome in the name,                                     711 We bless thee for this sacred day,                                    55 We come, O Lord, before thy throne,                                  835 We come our Sabbath hymn to raise,                                   759 We come to thee, O God,                                              818 We come with joy and gladness,                                       755 We gather in the name of God,                                        729 We have met in peace together,                                       749 Welcome, delightful morn,                                             12 Welcome, sweet day of rest,                                           46 We long to see that happy time,                                      310 We mourn for those who toil,                                         570 We praise thee if one rescued soul,                                  789 Were not the sinful Mary's tears,                                    273 Whatever dims thy sense of truth,                                    350 What glorious tidings do I hear,                                     256 What if the little rain should say,                                  750 What must it be to dwell above,                                      511 What secret hand at morning light,                                   937 What shall we render, bounteous Lord,                                785 What though no flowers the fig-tree clothe,                          629 What though the arm of conquering death,                             599 What though the stream be dead,                                      586 When Abraham, full of sacred awe,                                    873 When, as returns this solemn day,                                     70 When before thy throne we kneel,                                       1 When bending o'er the brink of life,                                 533 When brighter suns and milder skies                                  861 When called, O Lord, to mourn the doom,                              615 When children give their hearts to God,                              741 When darkness long has veiled my mind,                               337 When dread misfortune's tempests rise,                               983 Whene'er the clouds of sorrow roll,                                  626 When fainting in the sultry waste,                                   453 When floating on life's troubled sea,                                573 When gloomy thoughts and boding fears,                               623 When God descends with men to dwell,                                 289 When God revealed his gracious name,                                 642 When grief and anguish press me down,                                606 When his salvation bringing,                                         754 When human hopes and joys depart,                                    471 When I can read my title clear,                                      513 When Israel of the Lord beloved,                                     448 When I survey the wondrous cross,                                    693 When Jordan hushed his waters still,                                 205 When, like a stranger on our sphere,                                 787 When long the soul had slept in chains,                              777 When, Lord, to this our western land,                                736 When on her Maker's bosom,                                           986 When overwhelmed with grief,                                         469 When Power Divine in mortal form,                                    967 When quiet in my house I sit,                                        927 When shall the voice of singing,                                     300 When the worn spirit wants repose,                                     7 When the parting bosom bleeds,                                       829 When the vale of death appears,                                      538 When true religion gains a place,                                    411 When verdure clothes the fertile vale,                               860 When vexing thoughts within me rise,                                 608 When wakened by thy voice of power,                                  423 Where'er my gospel is proclaimed,                                    996 Where'er the Lord shall build my house,                              926 Where shall the child of sorrow find,                                972 Where shall we go to seek and find,                                  704 While here as wandering sheep we stray,                              453 While now upon this Sabbath eve,                                      97 While some in folly's pleasures roll,                                432 While sounds of war are heard around,                                875 While thee I seek, Protecting Power,                                 422 While through this changing world we roam,                           517 While thus thy throne of grace we seek,                               67 While yet the youthful spirit bears,                                 743 While with ceaseless course the sun,                                 888 Who is my neighbor? he whom thou,                                    779 Who shall a temple build for him,                                    700 Who shall towards thy chosen seat,                                   346 Why do we mourn departed friends,                                    574 Why on the bending willows hung,                                     977 Why should we start and fear to die,                                 534 Why weep for those, frail child of woe,                              571 Wide as his vast dominion lies,                                      163 With grateful hearts, with joyful tongues,                           848 Within thy house, O Lord, our God,                                    17 With sacred joy we lift our eyes                                      48 With songs and honors sounding loud,                                 853 With stately towers and bulwarks strong,                             655 With thy pure dews and rains,                                        798 Would you behold the works of God,                                   826 Ye boundless realms of joy,                                          160 Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim,
