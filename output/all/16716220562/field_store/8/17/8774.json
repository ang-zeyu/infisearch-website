This time the driver got some revenge by lashing a couple of them with his long whip. This provoked a volley of stones, causing Jim and his friend to duck down to avoid being hit.  \"Boys certainly are the deuce,\" declared the engineer with a laugh; \"they think we are fair game.\"  \"I'll give them a little of their own game!\" grinned Jim as he picked up a couple of stones on the seat opposite, and he leaned out of the window of the door, sending a stone at the group with accuracy and precision.  \"Look at the guy!\" they yelled; \"paste him in the head.\"  To their surprise Jim did not duck back at their return volley but fended off a couple of the shots with his forearm, and one he caught with his right hand as though it were a baseball, and hurled it back with a snappy, short arm throw that caught the thrower squarely on the thigh.  \"Hurrah for you, fellar!\" yelled the crowd.  Jim acknowledged the salute with a graceful wave of his hand.  \"Catching 'em Bill!\" he yelled up at the driver.  \"Gained half a block on 'em!\" cried Bill with enthusiasm. Jim could just make out a dark blur in the fog ahead where the pursued hack was galloping to some unknown destination. At the sight all the fierce excitement of the chase came over Jim. He must not let that Mexican escape this time. It meant everything to get a hold of him. He would recover his treasure belt, whose loss was not only a serious blow to his present plans, but an injury to his natural pride and confidence in himself. He could imagine his brother Tom saying:  \"Ought to have had me along, Jim; you are too innocent to travel alone.\"  Hearing the voice of his comrade, Jim drew in his head.  \"Catch a sight of the black pirate craft?\" inquired the engineer.  \"Dead ahead, and a smooth sea, sir,\" replied Jim touching his hat.  \"Glad to be off the pebbles anyway, Captain,\" returned the engineer; \"it may aid digestion, but it is doocid hard on old bones, like mine.\"  \"I'm going upon deck with the pilot,\" said Jim. \"I can't stay below here while that fellow is within hail.\"  \"Natural feeling, Jim,\" agreed the engineer, \"but you will have to have the Jehu up there slow down.\"  \"Can't afford to lose the time,\" declared Jim. \"I can reach the forward step and make it all right.\"  \"Risky,\" said the engineer, \"but that fact won't stop you.\"  He was correct, it did not, and the driver almost fell off his box in astonishment when he saw Jim's head at his elbow.  \"Hey! what's this!\" he yelled, as he clubbed his whip to strike. \"Oh! it's you is it, Mister,\" he changed his tone when he saw who it was. \"By thunder! I thought I was to be kilt.\"  \"I'll sit in front here, Bill,\" said Jim genially. \"I want to keep an eye open to see that that greaser don't give us the slip.\"  \"He's there in that hack yet,\" assured the driver; \"he hain't had a chance to jump out yit.\"  \"They ain't pulling ahead are they?\" inquired Jim, anxiously.  \"Holding 'em level going down this hill,\" replied the driver. \"My horse is a leetle heavy for a down grade, but you will see something different when we are going up hill or on the flat.\"  \"I believe you,\" said Jim heartily; \"that horse of yours is a good one.\"  \"Paid five hundred for him, he ought to be,\" declared his owner proudly.  Inside the hack the engineer was making himself as comfortable as possible. His feet were upon the opposite seat, the green carriage robe was wrapped snugly around him and his head was dented back into the soft cushions. He was thoroughly enjoying the chase in his own way. The lurching of the vehicle did not disturb him, and he felt a certain pleasure in the freedom from any immediate responsibility. There was an excitement, too, in not knowing where the chase would carry. It was all a strange section of the city where they now were. He could see the ghostly fronts of long lines of houses, one not distinguishably different from another, but as similar as if they had been sawn from the same block of wood. The fog palliated many a monstrosity of wooden ornament, little balcony, or carved pinnacle.  If John Berwick was quiescent on the inside of the hack, Jim was on the _qui vive_ on the outside. He had no idea of the direction in which they were going, but he was determined never to lose sight of that particular hack. At this moment they reached the bottom of a long hill. An eddy of air lifted the fog aside for an instant and Jim saw a head thrust out of the window of the hack.  \"Geewillikins!\" he exclaimed, wrathfully; \"that isn't the greaser!\"  Sure enough the head was not that belonging to the Mexican at all. It was a shaggy bearded face that leered back at Jim, and then he shouted some direction to the driver, and with a belligerent shake of his fist at Jim, jerked his head back.  \"I guess that hunchback is in there all the same,\" cried the driver.  \"He'd better be,\" growled Jim.  At the motion made by the bushy whiskered man, the driver of the first carriage in this active procession, turned his team at right angles into a street running east. \"Bill\" followed suit making a dangerous swerve, that almost overturned his vehicle, but it righted itself against the curb, and on the pursuit went. But Jim was beginning to be worried, for the big horse was tiring rapidly, while the mustangs seemed unflagging in their energy.  \"How far have we gone?\" asked Jim.  \"About two miles, Boss,\" replied the driver.  \"It won't be long till dusk,\" said Jim, \"with this fog rolling in.\"  \"I'll get back, what they have gained on us,\" declared Bill with conviction, \"before they have gone another mile.\"  Jim noticed that this new turn was taking them into an apparently better section of the city, where there were really some fine-looking residences.  \"They are making a stern chase of it, Jim,\" called Berwick, poking his head out of the window.  \"We will catch them yet, Chief,\" declared Jim with outward confidence.  \"Good boy!\" replied the engineer. \"I must say I like your spirit.\"  \"How are you putting in the time down there, John?\" queried Jim.  \"Taking it easy,\" replied Berwick; \"resting up in case I have to hustle a little later on.\"  \"Wise man!\" rejoined Jim; \"just as well to save your energies. There will be something doing pretty soon or I miss my guess. We should overhaul them on the next hill.\"  \"You look kind of damp, better get under cover, Jim,\" urged John Berwick. Indeed Jim did have a dampish look--his eyelashes and eyebrows were beaded with the moisture.  \"No, I'm going to stay on deck until we overhaul those pirates,\" he replied, \"and it won't be long either.\"  However, it was somewhat longer than Jim thought. It seemed that the driver of the forward coup√© was determined to make a clean getaway at this point for he laid on the whip with fierce determination.     CHAPTER XI  THE CHASE CONTINUED   After going a half a mile further, the leader in the race made another sharp turn, and a short distance ahead his goal was in sight, or it would have been had not the heavy fog prevailed. Of this, Jim was of course in nowise aware. Suddenly the hack ahead whirled and came to a stop. Two figures leaped out into the fog and started on the run.  Jim thrust a coin into the willing grasp of \"Bill,\" and leaped to the ground closely followed from the cab by John Berwick, leaving the two drivers to themselves, and only a few yards apart. These worthies taking no further interest in the performance of their recent fares, engaged in a wordy altercation as to the rival merits of their steeds, and each had a different answer to the problem of \"who won the race?\" The outcome of this led to blows; as to the result, that belongs to another chronicle than mine. We are at present concerned with the race between Jim and the Mexican, with the chief and \"Bushy Whiskers\" as runners up.  Jim bounded after the fleeing Mexican and his comrade, with all the speed of his pent-up energy, and was overtaking him rapidly, when what looked like a high dark rampart showed indistinct through the fog a few rods ahead. Then the Mexican bent low and darted out of sight, and his sturdy companion bounding high in the air disappeared.  Jim was thrown suddenly backward; as in mad pursuit, he dashed into an almost invisible fence of wire, steel colored,--which luckily was not barbed. The engineer who was a few paces behind, stopped in the nick of time, his outstretched hand easily breaking the force of his collision.  \"Hurt, Jim?\" he queried.  \"Naw!\" replied James. \"Come on, John, let's see if you can jump like his whiskers.\"  \"I'm no rat like that greaser,\" replied Berwick; \"I can't crawl through, I've got to jump.\"  He showed himself something of an acrobat by the grace and agility with which he vaulted the six foot fence, and Jim went over with more power if less grace. Now they were in a quandary for directly before them was a wood of the tall and ghostly eucalyptus, into which the two fugitives had fled.  \"We ought to have told our carriage to wait, Jim,\" said the chief engineer, with nonchalant humor. \"This reminds me of two needles and a haystack.\"  \"I've got their trail, Chief, come on before it gets too dark,\" ordered Jim, who had been casting around like a hound for a scent.  \"You are the 'Boy Scout, or the Young Kit Carson,' for fair, James,\" cried Berwick, giving him a hearty slap of admiration between his broad shoulders.  Jim grinned but made no reply as he followed the trail into the depth of the wood, which was made weird by the slender forms of the trees whose high tops were hidden by the low hanging mists that were as the breath of the huge ocean. The waters of the ocean not far away were slowly surging through the narrow pass of \"The Golden Gate.\"  Then the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20264"],["title","Parsifal: Story and Analysis of Wagner's Great Opera (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net/c/)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

In the morning I went into the beautiful gardens of the Neue Schloss. On either side of a lake, upon which float a couple of swans and innumerable water-lilies, the long parklike avenue of trees are vocal with wild doves, and the robin is heard in the adjoining thickets. At my approach the sweet song ceases abruptly, and the startled bird flies out, scattering the pale petals of the wild roses upon my path. I follow a stream of people on foot, as they move down the left-hand avenue in the garden of the Neue Schloss, which adjoins Wagner's own grounds.  Some are going--some are coming. Presently I see an opening in the bushes on my left; the path leads me to a clump of evergreens. I follow it, and come suddenly on the great composer's grave. All about the green square mound the trees are thick--laurel, fir, and yew. The shades fall funereally across the immense gray granite slab; but over the dark foliage the sky is bright blue, and straight in front of me, above the low bushes, I can see the bow-windows of the dead master's study--where I spent with him one delightful evening in 1876.  I can see, too, the jet of water that he loved playing high above the hedge of evergreen. It lulls me with its sound. \"Wahnfried! Wahnfried!\" it seems to murmur. It was the word written above the master's house--the word he most loved--the word his tireless spirit most believed in. How shall I render it? \"Dream-life! dream-life! Earth's illusion of joy!\"  Great spirit! thy dream-life here is past, and, face to face with truth, \"rapt from the fickle and the frail,\" for thee the illusion has vanished! Mayest thou also know the fulness of joy in the unbroken and serene activities of the eternal Reality!  I visited the grave twice. There is nothing written on the granite slab. There were never present less than twenty persons, and a constant stream of pilgrims kept coming and going.  One gentle token of the master's pitiful and tender regard for the faithful dumb animals he so loved lies but a few feet off in the same garden, and not far from his own grave.  Upon a mossy bank, surrounded with evergreens, is a small marble slab, with this inscription to his favorite dog:  \"_Here lies in peace 'Wahnfried's' faithful watcher and friend--the good and beautiful Mark_\" (der gute, sch√∂ne Mark)!  I returned, too, to Wagner's tomb, plucked a branch of the fir-tree that waved above it, and went back to my room to prepare myself by reading and meditation for the great religious drama which I was to witness at four o'clock in the afternoon--Wagner's latest and highest inspiration--the story of the sacred brotherhood, the knights of San Graal--_Parsifal_!     PARSIFAL   The blood of God!--mystic symbol of divine life--\"for the blood is the life thereof.\" That is the key-note of _Parsifal_, the Knight of the Sangrail. Wine is the ready symbolical vehicle--the material link between the divine and the human life. In the old religions, that heightened consciousness, that intensity of feeling produced by stimulant, was thought to be the very entering in of the \"god\"--the union of the divine and human spirit; and in the Eleusinian mysteries, the \"sesame,\" the bread of Demeter, the earth mother, and the \"kykeon,\" or wine of Dionysos, the vine god, were thus sacramental.  The passionate desire to approach and mingle with Deity is the one mystic bond common to all religions in all lands. It is the \"cry of the human;\" it traverses the ages, it exhausts many symbols and transcends all forms.  To the Christian it is summed up in the \"Lord's Supper.\"  The medieval legend of the Sangrail (real or royal blood) is the most poetic and pathetic form of transubstantiation; in it the gross materialism of the Roman Mass almost ceases to be repulsive; it possesses the true legendary power of attraction and assimilation.  As the Knights of the Table Round, with their holy vows, provided medieval Chivalry with a center, so did the Lord's table, with its Sangrail, provide medieval Religion with its central attractive point. And as all marvelous tales of knightly heroism circled round King Arthur's table, so did the great legends embodying the Christian conceptions of sin, punishment, and redemption circle round the Sangrail and the sacrifice of the \"Mass.\"  In the legends of _Parsifal_ and _Lohengrin_ the knightly and religious elements are welded together. This is enough. We need approach _Parsifal_ with no deep knowledge of the various Sagas made use of by Wagner in his drama. His disciples, while most eager to trace its various elements to their sources, are most emphatic in declaring that the _Parsifal_ drama, so intimately true to the spirit of Roman Catholicism, is nevertheless a new creation.  Joseph of Arimathea received in a crystal cup the blood of Christ as it flowed from the spear-wound made by the Roman soldier. The cup and the spear were committed to Titurel, who became a holy knight and head of a sacred brotherhood of knights. They dwelt in the Visigoth Mountains of Southern Spain, where, amid impenetrable forests, rose the legendary palace of Montsalvat. Here they guarded the sacred relics, issuing forth at times from their palatial fortress, like Lohengrin, to fight for innocence and right, and always returning to renew their youth and strength by the celestial contemplation of the Sangrail, and by occasional participation in the holy feast.  Time and history count for very little in these narratives. It was allowed, however, that Titurel the Chief had grown extremely aged, but it was not allowed that he could die in the presence of the Sangrail. He seemed to have been laid in a kind of trance, resting in an open tomb beneath the altar of the Grail; and whenever the cup was uncovered his voice might be heard joining in the celebration. Meanwhile, Amfortas, his son, reigned in his stead.  Montsalvat, with its pure, contemplative, but active brotherhood, and its mystic cup, thus stands out as the poetic symbol of all that is highest and best in medieval Christianity.  The note of the wicked world--Magic for Devotion--Sensuality for Worship--breaks in upon our vision, as the scene changes from the Halls of Montsalvat to Klingsor's palace. Klingsor, an impure knight, who has been refused admittance to the order of the \"Sangrail,\" enters into a compact with the powers of evil--by magic acquires arts of diabolical fascination--fills his palace and gardens with enchantments, and wages bitter war against the holy knights, with a view of corrupting them, and ultimately, it may be, of acquiring for himself the \"Sangrail,\" in which all power is believed to reside. Many knights have already succumbed to the \"insidious arts\" of Klingsor; but the tragical turning-point of the _Parsifal_ is that Amfortas, himself the son of Titurel, the official guardian of the Grail, in making war upon the magician, took with him the sacred spear, and _lost_ it to Klingsor.  It came about in this way. A woman of unearthly loveliness won him in the enchanted bowers adjoining the evil knight's palace, and Klingsor, seizing the holy spear, thrust it into Amfortas's side, inflicting what seemed an incurable wound. The brave knight, Gurnemanz, dragged his master fainting from the garden, his companions of the Sangrail covering their retreat. But, returned to Montsalvat, the unhappy king awakes only to bewail his sin, the loss of the sacred spear, and the ceaseless harrowing smart of an incurable wound. But who is Parsifal?         *       *       *       *       *  The smell of pine woods in July! The long avenue outside the city of Bayreuth, that leads straight up the hill, crowned by the Wagner Theater, a noble structure--architecturally admirable--severe, simple, but exactly adapted to its purpose. I join the stream of pilgrims, some in carriages, others on foot. As we approach, a clear blast of trombones and brass from the terrace in front of the grand entrance plays out the Grail \"motive.\" It is the well-known signal--there is no time to be lost. I enter at the prescribed door, and find myself close to my appointed place. Every one--such is the admirable arrangement--seems to do likewise. In a few minutes about one thousand persons are seated without"]]]
