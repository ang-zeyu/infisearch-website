I do not know what they actually did receive.  Below is the account:        THE GREAT RAILROAD CHASE!       _The Most Extraordinary and Astounding Adventure of the      War--The Most Daring Undertaking that Yankees ever Planned      or Attempted to Execute--Stealing an Engine--Tearing up the      Track--Pursued on Foot, on Hand-Cars, and      Engines--Overtaken--A Scattering--The Capture--The Wonderful      Energy of Messrs. Fuller, Murphy and Cain--Some Reflections,      &c., &c._       FULL PARTICULARS!!       Since our last issue, we have obtained full particulars of      the most thrilling railroad adventure that ever occurred on      the American continent, as well as the mightiest and most      important in its results, if successful, that has been      conceived by the Lincoln Government since the commencement      of this war. Nothing on so grand a scale has been attempted,      and nothing within the range of possibility could be      conceived, that would fall with such a tremendous, crushing      force upon us, as the accomplishment of the plans which      were concocted and dependent on the execution of the one      whose history we now proceed to narrate.       Its _reality_--_what was actually done_--excels all the      extravagant _conceptions_ of the Arrow-Smith hoax, which      fiction created such a profound sensation in Europe.       To make the matter more complete and intelligible, we will      take our readers over the same history of the case which we      related in our last, the main features of which are correct,      but are lacking in details, which have since come to hand.       We will begin at the breakfast-table of the Big Shanty Hotel      at Camp McDonald, on the Western and Atlantic Railroad,      where several regiments of soldiers are now encamped. The      morning mail and passenger train had left here at four A.      M., on last Saturday morning, as usual, and had stopped      there for breakfast. The conductor, William A. Fuller; the      engineer, I. Cain, both of this city; and the passengers      were at the table, when some eight men, having uncoupled the      engine and three empty box-cars next to it, from the      passenger and baggage-cars, mounted the engine, pulled open      the valve, put on all steam, and left conductor, engineer,      passengers, spectators, and the soldiers in the camp hard      by, all lost in amazement, and dumbfounded at the strange,      startling, and daring act.       This unheard-of act was, doubtless, undertaken at that place      and time upon the presumption that pursuit could not be made      by an engine short of Kingston, some thirty miles above, or      from this place; and that by cutting down the telegraph      wires as they proceeded, the adventurers could calculate on      at least three or four hours' start of any pursuit it was      reasonable to expect. This was a legitimate conclusion, and      but for the will, energy, and quick good judgment of Mr.      Fuller, and Mr. Cain, and Mr. Anthony Murphy, the      intelligent and practical foreman of the wood department of      the State Road shop, who accidentally went on the train from      this place that morning, their calculations would have      worked out as originally contemplated, and the results would      have been obtained long ere this reaches the eye of our      readers--the most terrible to us of any that we can conceive      as possible, and unequaled by any attempted or conceived      since this war commenced.       Now for the chase!       These three determined men, without a moment's delay, put      out after the flying train--_on foot_, amidst shouts of      laughter by the crowd, who, though lost in amazement at the      unexpected and daring act, could not repress their      risibility at seeing three men start after a train on foot,      which they had just witnessed depart at lightning speed.      They put on all their speed, and ran along the track for      three miles, when they came across some track-raisers, who      had a small truck-car, which is shoved along by men so      employed on railroads, on which to carry their tools. This      truck and men were at once \"impressed.\" They took it by      turns of two at a time to run behind this truck, and push it      along all up grades and level portions of the road, and let      it drive at will on all the down grades. A little way      further up the fugitive adventurers had stopped, cut the      telegraph wires, and torn up the track. Here the pursuers      were thrown off pell mell, truck and men, upon the side of      the road. Fortunately \"nobody was hurt on our side.\" The      truck was soon placed on the road again; enough hands were      left to repair the track, and with all the power of      determined will and muscle, they pushed on to Etowah      Station, some twenty miles above.       Here, most fortunately, Major Cooper's old coal engine, the      \"Yonah\"--one of the first engines on the State road--was      standing out, fired up. This venerable locomotive was      immediately turned upon her own track, and like an old      racer, at the tap of the drum, pricked up her ears and made      fine time to Kingston.       The fugitives, not expecting such early pursuit, quietly      took in wood and water at Cass Station, and borrowed a      schedule from the tank-tender, upon the plausible plea that      they were running a pressed train, loaded with powder, for      Beauregard. The attentive and patriotic tank-tender, Mr.      William Russell, said he gave them his schedule, and would      have sent the shirt off his back to Beauregard, if it had      been asked for. Here the adventurous fugitives inquired      which end of the switch they should go in on at Kingston.      When they arrived at Kingston, they stopped, went to the      agent there, told the powder story, readily got the      switch-key, went on the upper turn-out, and waited for the      down _way freight train to pass_. To all inquiries they      replied with the same powder story. When the freight train      had passed, they immediately proceeded on to the next      station--Adairsville--where they were to meet the _regular      down freight train_. At some point on the way they had taken      on some fifty cross-ties, and before reaching Adairsville,      they stopped on a curve, tore up the rails, and put seven      cross-ties on the track--no doubt intending to wreck this      down freight train, which would be along in a few minutes.      They had out upon the engine a red handkerchief, as a kind      of flag or signal, which, in railroading, means another      train is behind--thereby indicating to all that the regular      passenger train would be along presently. They stopped a      moment at Adairsville, and said Fuller, with the regular      passenger train, was behind, and would wait at Kingston for      the freight train, and told the conductor thereon to push      ahead and meet him at that point. They passed on to Calhoun,      where they met the down passenger train, due here at 4.20 P.      M., and without making any stop, they proceeded--on, on, and      on.       But we must return to Fuller and his party, whom we have      unconsciously left on the old \"Yonah,\" making their way to      Kingston.       Arriving there, and learning the adventurers were but twenty      minutes ahead, they left the \"Yonah\" to blow off, while they      mounted the engine of the Rome Branch Road, which was ready      fired up, and waiting for the arrival of the passenger train      nearly due, when it would have proceeded to Rome. A large      party of gentlemen volunteered for the chase, some at      Acworth, Altoona, Kingston, and other points, taking such      arms as they could lay their hands on at the moment; and      with this fresh engine they set out with all speed, but with      great \"care and caution,\" as they had scarcely time to make      Adairsville, before the down freight train would leave that      point. Sure enough, they discovered, this side of      Adairsville, three rails torn up and other impediments in      the way. They \"took up\" in time to prevent an accident, but      could proceed with the train no further. This was most      vexatious, and it may have been in some degree      disheartening; but it did not cause the slightest relaxation      of efforts, and, as the result proved, was but little in the      way of the _dead game_, pluck and resolutions of Fuller and      Murphy, who left the engine and again _put out on foot      alone_! After running two miles, they met the down freight      train, one mile out from Adairsville. They immediately      reversed the train, and ran backwards to Adairsville--put      the cars on the siding, and pressed forward, making fine      time to Calhoun, where they met the regular down passenger      train. Here they halted a moment, took on board a telegraph      operator, and a number of men who again volunteered, taking      their guns along--and continued the chase. Mr. Fuller also      took on here a company of track-hands to repair the track as      they went along. A short distance above Calhoun, they      _flushed their game_ on a curve, where they doubtless      supposed themselves out of danger, and were quietly oiling      the engine, taking up the track, &c. Discovering that they      were pursued, they mounted and sped away, throwing out upon      the track as they went along, the heavy cross-ties they had      prepared themselves with. This was done by breaking out the      end of the hindmost box-car, and pitching them out. Thus,      \"nip and tuck,\" they passed with fearful speed Resaca,      Tilton, and on through Dalton.

With Frontispiece  By THE KINNEYS    A. L. BURT COMPANY  Publishers  New York  Published by Arrangements with GEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY     Copyright, 1915,  By GEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY     DEDICATION  Dedications have gone out of vogue save with the old fashioned.  The ancient idea of an appeal to a patron has been eliminated from modern literature.  If a man now inscribes a book to any one it is that he may associate with his work the names of friends he loves and delights to honor.  There is always a certain amount of assurance in any such dedication, the assurance lying in the assumption that there is honor to the recipient in the association with the book.  Well, there is no mistaking the purpose anyway.  One of my best friends, and that friendship has been proved in war and peace, at home and abroad, is a Bank!  The Bank is like Mercy in more ways than one, but particularly in that it is twice blessed; it is blessed in what it receives, I hope, and in what it gives, I know. From the standpoint of the depositor sometimes it is better to receive than to give.  It has been so in my case and I have been able to persuade the Bank to that way of thinking.  Therefore, in grateful acknowledgment of the very present help it has been to me in time of need and in public recognition of many courtesies from its officers and directors, and as some evidence of my deep appreciation of its many kindnesses to me, I dedicate this book to  THE MOUNT VERNON TRUST COMPANY  of  MOUNT VERNON, NEW YORK     PREFACE  The Battle of Waterloo, which was fought just one hundred years ago and with which the story in this book ends, is popularly regarded as one of the decisive battles of the world, particularly with reference to the career of the greatest of all Captains.  Personally some study has led me to believe that Bautzen was really the decisive battle of the Napoleonic wars.  If the Emperor had there won the overwhelming victory to which his combinations and the fortunes of war entitled him he would still have retained his Empire.  Whether he would have been satisfied or not is another question; and anyway as I am practically alone among students and critics in my opinions about Bautzen they can be dismissed.  And that he lost that battle was his own fault anyway!  However Napoleon's genius cannot be denied any more than his failure. In this book I have sought to show him at his best and also almost at his worst.  For sheer brilliance, military and mental, the campaigning in France in 1814 could not be surpassed.  He is there with his raw recruits, his beardless boys, his old guard, his tactical and strategical ability, his furious energy, his headlong celerity and his marvelous power of inspiration; just as he was in Italy when he revolutionized the art of war and electrified the world.  Many of these qualities are in evidence in the days before Waterloo, but during the actual battle upon which his fate and the fate of the world turned, the tired, broken, ill man is drowsily nodding before a farmhouse by the road, while Ney, whose superb and headlong courage was not accompanied by any corresponding military ability, wrecks the last grand army.  And there is no more dramatic an incident in all history, I believe, than Napoleon's advance on the Fifth-of-the-line drawn up on the Grenoble Road on the return from Elba.  Nor do the Roman Eagles themselves seem to have made such romantic appeal or to have won such undying devotion as the Eagles of the Empire.  This story was written just before the outbreak of the present European war and is published while it is in full course.  Modern commanders wield forces beside which even the great Army of the Nations that invaded Russia is scarcely more than a detachment, and battles last for days, weeks, even months--Waterloo was decided in an afternoon!--yet war is the same.  If there be any difference it simply grows more horrible.  The old principles, however, are unchanged, and over the fields upon which Napoleon marched and fought, armies are marching and fighting in practically the same way to-day.  And great Captains are still studying Frederick, Wellington and Bonaparte as they have ever done.  The author modestly hopes that this book may not only entertain by the love story, the tragic yet happily ended romance within its pages--for there is romance here aside from the great Captain and his exploits--but that in a small way it may serve to set forth not so much the brilliance and splendor and glory of war as the horror of it.  We are frightfully fascinated by war, even the most peaceable and peace-loving of us.  May this story help to convey to the reader some of the other side of it; the hunger, the cold, the weariness, the suffering, the disaster, the despair of the soldier; as well as the love and the joy and the final happiness of the beautiful Laure and the brave Marteau to say nothing of redoubtable old Bal-Arrêt, the Bullet-Stopper--whose fates were determined on the battlefield amid the clash of arms.

AT LAST THE EAGLE AND THE WOMAN     PROLOGUE  VIVE L'EMPEREUR  The weatherworn Château d'Aumenier stands in the midst of a noble park of trees forming part of an extensive domain not far to the northwest of the little town of Sézanne, in the once famous county of Champagne, in France.  The principal room of the castle is a great hall in the oldest part of the venerable pile which dates back for eight hundred years, or to the tenth century and the times of the famous Count Eudes himself, for whom it was held by one of his greatest vassals.  The vast apartment is filled with rare and interesting mementos of its distinguished owners, including spoils of war and trophies of the chase, acquired in one way or another in the long course of their history, and bespeaking the courage, the power, the ruthlessness, and, sometimes, the unscrupulousness of the hard-hearted, heavy-handed line. Every country in Europe and every age, apparently, has been levied upon to adorn this great hall, with its long mullioned windows, its enormous fireplace, its huge carved stone mantel, its dark oak paneled walls and beamed ceiling.  But, the most interesting, the most precious of all the wonderful things therein has a place of honor to itself at the end farthest from the main entrance.  Fixed against this wall is a broken staff, or pole, surmounted by a small metallic figure.  The staff is fastened to the wall by clamps of tempered steel which are further secured by delicate locks of skillful and intricate workmanship.  The pole is topped by the gilded effigy of an eagle.  In dimensions the eagle is eight inches high, from head to feet, and nine and a half inches wide, from wing tip to wing tip.  Heraldically, \"_Un Aigle Éployé_\" it would be called.  That is, an eagle in the act of taking flight--in the vernacular, a \"spread eagle.\"  The eagle looks to the left, with its wings half expanded.  In its talons it grasps a thunderbolt, as in the old Roman standard.  Those who have ever wandered into the Monastery of the Certosa, at Milan, have seen just such an eagle on one of the tombs of the great Visconti family.  For, in truth, this emblem has been modeled after that one.  Below the thunderbolt is a tablet of brass, three inches square, on which is a raised number.  In this instance, the number is five.  The copper of which the eagle is molded was originally gilded, but in its present battered condition much of the gilt has been worn off, or shot off, and the original material is plainly discernible.  If it could be lifted its weight would be found to be about three and a half pounds.  Around the neck of the eagle hangs a wreath of pure gold.  There is an inscription on the back of it, which says that the wreath was presented to the regiment by the loyal city of Paris after the wonderful Ulm campaign.  One of the claws of the eagle has been shot away.  The gold laurel wreath has also been struck by a bullet, and some of its leaves are gone.  The tip of one wing is missing.  The head of the eagle, originally proudly and defiantly erect, has been bent backward so that, instead of a level glance, it looks upward, and there is a deep dent in it, as from a blow.  And right in the breast gapes a great ragged shot-hole, which pierces the"]]]
