ELMIRE (coughing to draw her husband's attention)   What! Must you go so fast?--and all at once   Exhaust the whole love of a woman's heart?   She does herself the violence to make   This dear confession of her love, and you   Are not yet satisfied, and will not be   Without the granting of her utmost favours?    TARTUFFE   The less a blessing is deserved, the less   We dare to hope for it; and words alone   Can ill assuage our love's desires. A fate   Too full of happiness, seems doubtful still;   We must enjoy it ere we can believe it.   And I, who know how little I deserve   Your goodness, doubt the fortunes of my daring;   So I shall trust to nothing, madam, till   You have convinced my love by something real.    ELMIRE   Ah! How your love enacts the tyrant's role,   And throws my mind into a strange confusion!   With what fierce sway it rules a conquered heart,   And violently will have its wishes granted!   What! Is there no escape from your pursuit?   No respite even?--not a breathing space?   Nay, is it decent to be so exacting,   And so abuse by urgency the weakness   You may discover in a woman's heart?    TARTUFFE   But if my worship wins your gracious favour,   Then why refuse me some sure proof thereof?    ELMIRE   But how can I consent to what you wish,   Without offending Heaven you talk so much of?    TARTUFFE   If Heaven is all that stands now in my way,   I'll easily remove that little hindrance;   Your heart need not hold back for such a trifle.    ELMIRE   But they affright us so with Heaven's commands!    TARTUFFE   I can dispel these foolish fears, dear madam;   I know the art of pacifying scruples   Heaven forbids, 'tis true, some satisfactions;   But we find means to make things right with Heaven.    ('Tis a scoundrel speaking.) [5]    [Footnote 5: Moliere's note, in the original edition.]    There is a science, madam, that instructs us   How to enlarge the limits of our conscience   According to our various occasions,   And rectify the evil of the deed   According to our purity of motive.   I'll duly teach you all these secrets, madam;   You only need to let yourself be guided.   Content my wishes, have no fear at all;   I answer for't, and take the sin upon me.    (Elmire coughs still louder.)   Your cough is very bad.    ELMIRE   Yes, I'm in torture.    TARTUFFE   Would you accept this bit of licorice?    ELMIRE   The case is obstinate, I find; and all   The licorice in the world will do no good.    TARTUFFE   'Tis very trying.    ELMIRE   More than words can say.    TARTUFFE   In any case, your scruple's easily   Removed. With me you're sure of secrecy,   And there's no harm unless a thing is known.   The public scandal is what brings offence,   And secret sinning is not sin at all.    ELMIRE (after coughing again)   So then, I see I must resolve to yield;   I must consent to grant you everything,   And cannot hope to give full satisfaction   Or win full confidence, at lesser cost.   No doubt 'tis very hard to come to this;   'Tis quite against my will I go so far;   But since I must be forced to it, since nothing   That can be said suffices for belief,   Since more convincing proof is still demanded,   I must make up my mind to humour people.   If my consent give reason for offence,   So much the worse for him who forced me to it;   The fault can surely not be counted mine.    TARTUFFE   It need not, madam; and the thing itself ...    ELMIRE   Open the door, I pray you, and just see   Whether my husband's not there, in the hall.    TARTUFFE   Why take such care for him? Between ourselves,   He is a man to lead round by the nose.   He's capable of glorying in our meetings;   I've fooled him so, he'd see all, and deny it.    ELMIRE   No matter; go, I beg you, look about,   And carefully examine every corner.      SCENE VI    ORGON, ELMIRE     ORGON (crawling out from under the table)   That is, I own, a man ... abominable!   I can't get over it; the whole thing floors me.    ELMIRE   What? You come out so soon? You cannot mean it!   Get back under the table; 'tis not time yet;   Wait till the end, to see, and make quite certain,   And don't believe a thing on mere conjecture.    ORGON   Nothing more wicked e'er came out of Hell.    ELMIRE   Dear me! Don't go and credit things too lightly.   No, let yourself be thoroughly convinced;   Don't yield too soon, for fear you'll be mistaken.    (As Tartuffe enters, she makes her husband stand behind her.)      SCENE VII    TARTUFFE, ELMIRE, ORGON     TARTUFFE (not seeing Orgon)   All things conspire toward my satisfaction,   Madam, I've searched the whole apartment through.   There's no one here; and now my ravished soul ...    ORGON (stopping him)   Softly! You are too eager in your amours;   You needn't be so passionate. Ah ha!   My holy man! You want to put it on me!   How is your soul abandoned to temptation!   Marry my daughter, eh?--and want my wife, too?   I doubted long enough if this was earnest,   Expecting all the time the tone would change;   But now the proof's been carried far enough;   I'm satisfied, and ask no more, for my part.    ELMIRE (to Tartuffe)   'Twas quite against my character to play   This part; but I was forced to treat you so.    TARTUFFE   What? You believe ... ?    ORGON   Come, now, no protestations.   Get out from here, and make no fuss about it.    TARTUFFE   But my intent ...    ORGON   That talk is out of season.   You leave my house this instant.    TARTUFFE   You're the one   To leave it, you who play the master here!   This house belongs to me, I'll have you know,   And show you plainly it's no use to turn   To these low tricks, to pick a quarrel with me,   And that you can't insult me at your pleasure,   For I have wherewith to confound your lies,   Avenge offended Heaven, and compel   Those to repent who talk to me of leaving.      SCENE VIII    ELMIRE, ORGON     ELMIRE   What sort of speech is this? What can it mean?    ORGON   My faith, I'm dazed. This is no laughing matter.    ELMIRE   What?    ORGON   From his words I see my great mistake;   The deed of gift is one thing troubles me.    ELMIRE   The deed of gift ...    ORGON   Yes, that is past recall.   But I've another thing to make me anxious.    ELMIRE   What's that?    ORGON   You shall know all. Let's see at once   Whether a certain box is still upstairs.       ACT V      SCENE I    ORGON, CLEANTE     CLEANTE   Whither away so fast?    ORGON   How should I know?    CLEANTE   Methinks we should begin by taking counsel   To see what can be done to meet the case.    ORGON   I'm all worked up about that wretched box.   More than all else it drives me to despair.    CLEANTE   That box must hide some mighty mystery?    ORGON   Argas, my friend who is in trouble, brought it   Himself, most secretly, and left it with me.   He chose me, in his exile, for this trust;   And on these documents, from what he said,   I judge his life and property depend.    CLEANTE   How could you trust them to another's hands?    ORGON   By reason of a conscientious scruple.   I went straight to my traitor, to confide   In him; his sophistry made me believe   That I must give the box to him to keep,   So that, in case of search, I might deny   My having it at all, and still, by favour   Of this evasion, keep my conscience clear   Even in taking oath against the truth.    CLEANTE   Your case is bad, so far as I can see;   This deed of gift, this trusting of the secret   To him, were both--to state my frank opinion--   Steps that you took too lightly; he can lead you   To any length, with these for hostages;   And since he holds you at such disadvantage,   You'd be still more imprudent, to provoke him;   So you must go some gentler way about.    ORGON   What! Can a soul so base, a heart so false,   Hide neath the semblance of such touching fervour?   I took him in, a vagabond, a beggar! ...   'Tis too much! No more pious folk for me!   I shall abhor them utterly forever,   And henceforth treat them worse than any devil.    CLEANTE   So! There you go again, quite off the handle!   In nothing do you keep an even temper.   You never know what reason is, but always   Jump first to one extreme, and then the other.   You see your error, and you recognise   That you've been cozened by a feigned zeal;   But to make up for't, in the name of reason,   Why should you plunge into a worse mistake,   And find no difference in character   Between a worthless scamp, and all good people?   What! Just because a rascal boldly duped you   With pompous show of false austerity,   Must you needs have it everybody's like him,   And no one's truly pious nowadays?   Leave such conclusions to mere infidels;   Distinguish virtue from its counterfeit,   Don't give esteem too quickly, at a venture,   But try to keep, in this, the golden mean.   If you can help it, don't uphold imposture;   But do not rail at true devoutness, either;   And if you must fall into one extreme,   Then rather err again the other way.      SCENE II    DAMIS, ORGON, CLEANTE     DAMIS   What! father, can the scoundrel threaten you,   Forget the many benefits received,   And in his base abominable pride   Make of your very favours arms against you?    ORGON   Too true, my son. It tortures me to think on't.    DAMIS   Let me alone, I'll chop his ears off for him.   We must deal roundly with his insolence;   'Tis I must free you from him at a blow;   'Tis I, to set things right, must strike him down.    CLEANTE   Spoke like a true young man. Now just calm down,   And moderate your towering tantrums, will you?   We live in such an age, with such a king,   That violence can not advance our cause.      SCENE III    MADAME PERNELLE, ORGON, ELMIRE, CLEANTE, MARIANE, DAMIS, DORINE     MADAME PERNELLE   What's this? I hear of fearful mysteries!    ORGON   Strange things indeed, for my own eyes to witness;   You see how I'm requited for my kindness,   I zealously receive a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],["title","The Yellow Claw (#0)"],["body","YELLOW CLAW  by Sax Rohmer   CONTENTS  CHAPTER        I  THE LADY OF THE CIVET FURS       II  MIDNIGHT--AND MR.

The light of the table-lamp, softened and enriched by its mosaic shade, gave an appearance of added opulence to the already handsome appointments of the room. The little table-clock ticked merrily from half-past eleven to a quarter to twelve.  Into the cozy, bookish atmosphere of the novelist's study penetrated the muffled chime of Big Ben; it chimed the three-quarters. But, with his mind centered upon his work, Leroux wrote on ceaselessly.  An odd figure of a man was this popular novelist, with patchy and untidy hair which lessened the otherwise striking contour of his brow. A neglected and unpicturesque figure, in a baggy, neutral-colored dressing-gown; a figure more fitted to a garret than to this spacious, luxurious workroom, with the soft light playing upon rank after rank of rare and costly editions, deepening the tones in the Persian carpet, making red morocco more red, purifying the vellum and regilding the gold of the choice bindings, caressing lovingly the busts and statuettes surmounting the book-shelves, and twinkling upon the scantily-covered crown of Henry Leroux. The door bell rang.  Leroux, heedless of external matters, pursued his work. But the door bell rang again and continued to ring.  “Soames! Soames!” Leroux raised his voice irascibly, continuing to write the while. “Where the devil are you! Can't you hear the door bell?”  Soames did not reveal himself; and to the ringing of the bell was added the unmistakable rattling of a letter-box.  “Soames!” Leroux put down his pen and stood up. “Damn it! he's out! I have no memory!”  He retied the girdle of his dressing-gown, which had become unfastened, and opened the study door. Opposite, across the entrance lobby, was the outer door; and in the light from the lobby lamp he perceived two laughing eyes peering in under the upraised flap of the letter-box. The ringing ceased.  “Are you VERY angry with me for interrupting you?” cried a girl's voice.  “My dear Miss Cumberly!” said Leroux without irritation; “on the contrary--er--I am delighted to see you--or rather to hear you. There is nobody at home, you know.”...  “I DO know,” replied the girl firmly, “and I know something else, also. Father assures me that you simply STARVE yourself when Mrs. Leroux is away! So I have brought down an omelette!”  “Omelette!” muttered Leroux, advancing toward the door; “you have--er--brought an omelette! I understand--yes; you have brought an omelette? Er--that is very good of you.”  He hesitated when about to open the outer door, raising his hands to his dishevelled hair and unshaven chin. The flap of the letter-box dropped; and the girl outside could be heard stifling her laughter.  “You must think me--er--very rude,” began Leroux; “I mean--not to open the door. But”...  “I quite understand,” concluded the voice of the unseen one. “You are a most untidy object! And I shall tell Mira DIRECTLY she returns that she has no right to leave you alone like this! Now I am going to hurry back upstairs; so you may appear safely. Don't let the omelette get cold. Good night!”  “No, certainly I shall not!” cried Leroux. “So good of you--I--er--do like omelette.... Good night!”  Calmly he returned to his writing-table, where, in the pursuit of the elusive character whose exploits he was chronicling and who had brought him fame and wealth, he forgot in the same moment Helen Cumberly and the omelette.  The table-clock ticked merrily on; SCRATCH--SCRATCH--SPLUTTER--SCRATCH--went Henry Leroux's pen; for this up-to-date litterateur, essayist by inclination, creator of “Martin Zeda, Criminal Scientist” by popular clamor, was yet old-fashioned enough, and sufficient of an enthusiast, to pen his work, while lesser men dictated.  So, amidst that classic company, smiling or frowning upon him from the oaken shelves, where Petronius Arbiter, exquisite, rubbed shoulders with Balzac, plebeian; where Omar Khayyam leaned confidentially toward Philostratus; where Mark Twain, standing squarely beside Thomas Carlyle, glared across the room at George Meredith, Henry Leroux pursued the amazing career of “Martin Zeda.”  It wanted but five minutes to the hour of midnight, when again the door bell clamored in the silence.  Leroux wrote steadily on. The bell continued to ring, and, furthermore, the ringer could be heard beating upon the outer door.  “Soames!” cried Leroux irritably, “Soames! Why the hell don't you go to the door!”  Leroux stood up, dashing his pen upon the table.  “I shall have to sack that damned man!” he cried; “he takes too many liberties--stopping out until this hour of the night!”  He pulled open the study door, crossed the hallway, and opened the door beyond.  In, out of the darkness--for the stair lights had been extinguished--staggered a woman; a woman whose pale face exhibited, despite the ravages of sorrow or illness, signs of quite unusual beauty. Her eyes were wide opened, and terror-stricken, the pupils contracted almost to vanishing point. She wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur wrapped tightly about her, and, as Leroux opened the door, she tottered past him into the lobby, glancing back over her shoulder.  With his upraised hands plunged pathetically into the mop of his hair, Leroux turned and stared at the intruder. She groped as if a darkness had descended, clutched at the sides of the study doorway, and then, unsteadily, entered--and sank down upon the big chesterfield in utter exhaustion.  Leroux, rubbing his chin, perplexedly, walked in after her. He scarcely had his foot upon the study carpet, ere the woman started up, tremulously, and shot out from the enveloping furs a bare arm and a pointing, quivering finger.  “Close the door!” she cried hoarsely--“close the door!... He has... followed me!”...  The disturbed novelist, as a man in a dream, turned, retraced his steps, and closed the outer door of the flat. Then, rubbing his chin more vigorously than ever and only desisting from this exercise to fumble in his dishevelled hair, he walked back into the study, whose Athenean calm had thus mysteriously been violated.  Two minutes to midnight; the most respectable flat in respectable Westminster; a lonely and very abstracted novelist--and a pale-faced, beautiful woman, enveloped in costly furs, sitting staring with fearful eyes straight before her. This was such a scene as his sense of the proprieties and of the probabilities could never have permitted Henry Leroux to create.  His visitor kept moistening her dry lips and swallowing, emotionally.  Standing at a discreet distance from her:--  “Madam,” began Leroux, nervously.  She waved her hand, enjoining him to silence, and at the same time intimating that she would explain herself directly speech became possible. Whilst she sought to recover her composure, Leroux, gradually forcing himself out of the dreamlike state, studied her with a sort of anxious curiosity.  It now became apparent to him that his visitor was no more than twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, but illness or trouble, or both together, had seared and marred her beauty. Amid the auburn masses of her hair, gleamed streaks, not of gray, but of purest white. The low brow was faintly wrinkled, and the big--unnaturally big--eyes were purple shaded; whilst two heavy lines traced their way from the corner of the nostrils to the corner of the mouth--of the drooping mouth with the bloodless lips.  Her pallor became more strange and interesting the longer he studied it; for, underlying the skin was a yellow tinge which he found inexplicable, but which he linked in his mind with the contracted pupils of her eyes, seeking vainly for a common cause.  He had a hazy impression that his visitor, beneath her furs, was most inadequately clothed; and seeking confirmation of this, his gaze strayed downward to where one little slippered foot peeped out from the civet furs.  Leroux suppressed a gasp. He had caught a glimpse of a bare ankle!  He crossed to his writing-table, and seated himself, glancing sideways at this living mystery. Suddenly she began, in a voice tremulous and scarcely audible:--  “Mr. Leroux, at a great--at a very great personal risk, I have come to-night. What I have to ask of you--to entreat of you, will... will”...  Two bare arms emerged from the fur, and she began clutching at her throat and bosom as though choking--dying.  Leroux leapt up and would have run to her; but forcing a ghastly smile, she waved him away again.  “It is all right,” she muttered, swallowing noisily. But frightful spasms of pain convulsed her, contorting her pale face.  “Some brandy--!” cried Leroux, anxiously.  “If you please,” whispered the"]]]
