There is, too, in these lines (352-354), as in many others, an echo of Wordsworth. In the _Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle_ it is told how the \"two undying fish\" of Bowscale Tarn, and the \"eagle lord of land and sea\" ministered to the shepherd-lord. It was no wonder that the critics of 1816 animadverted on Byron's \"communion\" with the Lakers. \"He could not,\" writes a Critical Reviewer (Series V. vol. iv. pp. 567-581), \"carry many volumes on his tour, but among the few, we will venture to predict, are found the two volumes of poems lately republished by Mr. Wordsworth.... Such is the effect of reading and enjoying the poetry of Mr. W., to whose system (ridiculed alike by those who could not, and who would not understand it) Lord Byron, it is evident, has become a tardy convert, and of whose merits in the poems on our table we have a silent but unequivocal acknowledgment.\"]  [34] {28}[Compare the well-known lines in Lovelace's \"To Althea--From Prison\"--      \"Minds innocent and quiet take     That for an hermitage.\"]  [h] Here follows in the MS.--  _Nor stew I of my subjects one_--                   /  _hath so little_  \\ _What sovereign_ <                      > _done?_                   \\ _yet so much hath_ /                                        POEMS OF                             JULY-SEPTEMBER, 1816.                                  THE DREAM.                            INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_   _The Dream_, which was written at Diodati in July, 1816 (probably towards the end of the month; see letters to Murray and Rogers, dated July 22 and July 29), is a retrospect and an apology. It consists of an opening stanza, or section, on the psychology of dreams, followed by some episodes or dissolving views, which purport to be the successive stages of a dream. Stanzas ii. and iii. are descriptive of Annesley Park and Hall, and detail two incidents of Byron's boyish passion for his neighbour and distant cousin, Mary Anne Chaworth. The first scene takes place on the top of \"Diadem Hill,\" the \"cape\" or rounded spur of the long ridge of Howatt Hill, which lies about half a mile to the south-east of the hall. The time is the late summer or early autumn of 1803. The \"Sun of Love\" has not yet declined, and the \"one beloved face\" is still shining on him; but he is beginning to realize that \"her sighs are not for him,\" that she is out of his reach. The second scene, which belongs to the following year, 1804, is laid in the \"antique oratory\" (not, as Moore explains, another name for the hall, but \"a small room built over the porch, or principal entrance of the hall, and looking into the courtyard\"), and depicts the final parting. His doom has been pronounced, and his first impulse is to pen some passionate reproach, but his heart fails him at the sight of the \"Lady of his Love,\" serene and smiling, and he bids her farewell with smiles on his lips, but grief unutterable in his heart.  Stanza iv. recalls an incident of his Eastern travels--a halt at noonday by a fountain on the route from Smyrna to Ephesus (March 14, 1810), \"the heads of camels were seen peeping above the tall reeds\" (see _Travels in Albania_, 1858, ii. 59.).  The next episode (stanza v.) depicts an imaginary scene, suggested, perhaps, by some rumour or more definite assurance, and often present to his \"inward eye\"--the \"one beloved,\" the mother of a happy family, but herself a forsaken and unhappy wife.  He passes on (stanza vi.) to his marriage in 1815, his bride \"gentle\" and \"fair,\" but _not_ the \"one beloved,\"--to the wedding day, when he stood before an altar, \"like one forlorn,\" confused by the sudden vision of the past fulfilled with Love the \"indestructible\"!  In stanza vii. he records and analyzes the \"sickness of the soul,\" the so-called \"phrenzy\" which had overtaken and changed the \"Lady of his Love;\" and, finally (stanza viii.), he lays bare the desolation of his heart, depicting himself as at enmity with mankind, but submissive to Nature, the \"Spirit of the Universe,\" if, haply, there may be \"reserved a blessing\" even for him, the rejected and the outlaw.  Moore says (_Life_, p. 321) that _The Dream_ cost its author \"many a tear in writing\"--being, indeed, the most mournful as well as picturesque \"story of a wandering life\" that ever came from the pen and heart of man. In his _Real Lord Byron_ (i. 284) Mr. Cordy Jeaffreson maintains that _The Dream_ \"has no autobiographical value.... A dream it was, as false as dreams usually are.\" The character of the poet, as well as the poem itself, suggests another criticism. Byron suffered or enjoyed vivid dreams, and, as poets will, shaped his dreams, consciously and of set purpose, to the furtherance of his art, but nothing concerning himself interested him or awoke the slumbering chord which was not based on actual fact. If the meeting on the \"cape crowned with a peculiar diadem,\" and the final interview in the \"antique oratory\" had never happened or happened otherwise; if he had not \"quivered\" during the wedding service at Seaham; if a vision of Annesley and Mary Chaworth had not flashed into his soul,--he would have taken no pleasure in devising these incidents and details, and weaving them into a fictitious narrative. He took himself too seriously to invent and dwell lovingly on the acts and sufferings of an imaginary Byron. The Dream is \"picturesque\" because the accidents of the scenes are dealt with not historically, but artistically, are omitted or supplied according to poetical licence; but the record is neither false, nor imaginary, nor unusual. On the other hand, the composition and publication of the poem must be set down, if not to malice and revenge, at least to the preoccupancy of chagrin and remorse, which compelled him to take the world into his confidence, cost what it might to his own self-respect, or the peace of mind and happiness of others.

See, too, an interesting quotation from Sir Richard Phillips' unfinished _Personal Tour through the United Kingdom_, published in the _Mirror_, 1828, vol. xii. p. 286; _Abbotsford and Newstead Abbey_, by Washington Irving, 1835, p. 191, _seq._; _The House and Grave of Byron_, 1855; and an article in _Lippincott's Magazine_, 1876, vol. xviii. pp. 637, _seq._                                     THE DREAM                          I.      Our life is twofold: Sleep hath its own world,     A boundary between the things misnamed     Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world,     And a wide realm of wild reality,     And dreams in their developement have breath,     And tears, and tortures, and the touch of Joy;     They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,     They take a weight from off our waking toils,     They do divide our being;[35] they become     A portion of ourselves as of our time,                              10     And look like heralds of Eternity;     They pass like spirits of the past,--they speak     Like Sibyls of the future; they have power--     The tyranny of pleasure and of pain;     They make us what we were not--what they will,     And shake us with the vision that's gone by,[36]     The dread of vanished shadows--Are they so?     Is not the past all shadow?--What are they?     Creations of the mind?--The mind can make     Substance, and people planets of its own                            20     With beings brighter than have been, and give     A breath to forms which can outlive all flesh.[37]     I would recall a vision which I dreamed     Perchance in sleep--for in itself a thought,     A slumbering thought, is capable of years,     And curdles a long life into one hour.[38]                          II.      I saw two beings in the hues of youth     Standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,     Green and of mild declivity, the last     As 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,                         30     Save that there was no sea to lave its base,     But a most living landscape, and the wave     Of woods and cornfields, and the abodes of men     Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke     Arising from such rustic roofs;--the hill     Was crowned with a peculiar diadem     Of trees, in circular array, so fixed,     Not by the sport of nature, but of man:     These two, a maiden and a youth, were there     Gazing--th"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20158"],["title","The Works of Lord Byron.

As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,     The Maid was on the eve of Womanhood;     The Boy had fewer summers, but his heart     Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye     There was but one belovéd face on earth,     And that was shining on him: he had looked     Upon it till it could not pass away;                                50     He had no breath, no being, but in hers;     She was his voice; he did not speak to her,     But trembled on her words; she was his sight,[i][39]     For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,     Which coloured all his objects:--he had ceased     To live within himself; she was his life,     The ocean to the river of his thoughts,[40]     Which terminated all: upon a tone,     A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,[41]     And his cheek change tempestuously--his heart                       60     Unknowing of its cause of agony.     But she in these fond feelings had no share:     Her sighs were not for him; to her he was     Even as a brother--but no more; 'twas much,     For brotherless she was, save in the name     Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;     Herself the solitary scion left     Of a time-honoured race.[42]--It was a name     Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not--and why?     Time taught him a deep answer--when she loved                       70     Another: even _now_ she loved another,     And on the summit of that hill she stood     Looking afar if yet her lover's steed[43]     Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.                          III.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     There was an ancient mansion, and before     Its walls there was a steed caparisoned:     Within an antique Oratory stood     The Boy of whom I spake;--he was alone,[44]     And pale, and pacing to and fro: anon                               80     He sate him down, and seized a pen, and traced     Words which I could not guess of; then he leaned     His bowed head on his hands, and shook as 'twere     With a convulsion--then arose again,     And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear     What he had written, but he shed no tears.     And he did calm himself, and fix his brow     Into a kind of quiet: as he paused,     The Lady of his love re-entered there;     She was serene and smiling then, and yet                            90     She knew she was by him beloved--she knew,     For quickly comes such knowledge,[45] that his heart     Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw     That he was wretched, but she saw not all.     He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp     He took her hand; a moment o'er his face     A tablet of unutterable thoughts     Was traced, and then it faded, as it came;     He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps     Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,                             100     For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed     From out the massy gate of that old Hall,     And mounting on his steed he went his way;     And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.[46]                          IV.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds     Of fiery climes he made himself a home,     And his Soul drank their sunbeams: he was girt     With strange and dusky aspects; he was not     Himself like what he had been; on the sea                          110     And on the shore he was a wanderer;     There was a mass of many images     Crowded like waves upon me, but he was     A part of all; and in the last he lay     Reposing from the noontide sultriness,     Couched among fallen columns, in the shade     Of ruined walls that had survived the names     Of those who reared them; by his sleeping side     Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds     Were fastened near a fountain; and a man                           120     Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while,     While many of his tribe slumbered around:     And they were canopied by the blue sky,     So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,     That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.[47]                          V.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     The Lady of his love was wed with One     Who did not love her better:--in her home,     A thousand leagues from his,--her native home,     She dwelt, begirt with growing Infancy,                            130     Daughters and sons of Beauty,--but behold!     Upon her face there was the tint of grief,     The settled shadow of an inward strife,     And an unquiet drooping of the eye,     As if its lid were charged with unshed tears.[48]     What could her grief be?--she had all she loved,     And he who had so loved her was not there     To trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,     Or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts.     What could her grief be?--she had loved him not,                   140     Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,     Nor could he be a part of that which preyed     Upon her mind--a spectre of the past.                          VI.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     The Wanderer was returned.--I saw him stand     Before an Altar--with a gentle bride;     Her face was fair, but was not that which made     The Starlight[49] of his Boyhood;--as he stood     Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came     The self-same aspect, and the quivering shock[50]                  150     That in the antique Oratory shook     His bosom in its solitude; and then--     As in that hour--a moment o'er his face     The tablet of unutterable thoughts     Was traced,--and then it faded as it came,     And he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke     The fitting vows, but heard not his own words,     And all things reeled around him; he could see     Not that which was, nor that which should have been--     But the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,                      160     And the remembered chambers, and the place,     The day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,     All things pertaining to that place and hour     And her who was his destiny, came back     And thrust themselves between him and the light:     What business had they there at such a time?                          VII.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     The Lady of his love;--Oh! she was changed     As by the sickness of the soul; her mind     Had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes                       170     They had not their own lustre, but the look     Which is not of the earth; she was become     The Queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts     Were combinations of disjointed things;     And forms, impalpable and unperceived     Of others' sight, familiar were to hers.     And this the world calls frenzy; but the wise     Have a far deeper madness--and the glance     Of melancholy is a fearful gift;     What is it but the telescope of truth?                             180     Which strips the distance of its fantasies,     And brings life near in utter nakedness,     Making the cold reality too real![j][51]                          VIII.      A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.     The Wanderer was alone as heretofore,     The beings which surrounded him were gone,     Or were at war with him; he was a mark     For blight and desolation, compassed round     With Hatred and Contention; Pain was mixed     In all which was served up to him, until,                          190     Like to the Pontic monarch of old days,[52]     He fed on poisons, and they had no power,     But were a kind of nutriment; he lived     Through that which had been death to many men,     And made him friends of mountains:[53] with the stars     And the quick Spirit of the Universe[54]     He held his dialogues; and they did teach     To him the magic of their mysteries;     To him the book of Night was opened wide,     And voices from the deep abyss revealed[55]                        200     A marvel and a secret--Be it so.                          IX.      My dream was past; it had no further change.     It was of a strange order, that the doom     Of these two creatures should be thus traced out     Almost like a reality--the one     To end in madness--both in misery.  _July_, 1816.  [First published, _The Prisoner of Chillon_, etc., 1816.]                                  DARKNESS.[k][56]      I had a dream, which was not all a dream.     The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars     Did wander darkling in the eternal space,     Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth     Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;     Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day,     And men forgot their passions in the dread     Of this their desolation; and all hearts     Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:     And they did live by watchfires--and the thrones,                   10     The palaces of crownéd kings--the huts,     The habitations of all things which dwell,     Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,     And men were gathered round their blazing homes     To look once more into each other's face;     Happy were those who dwelt within the eye     Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:     A fearful hope was all the World contained;     Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour     They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks                       20     Extinguished with a crash--and all was black.     The brows of men by the despairing light     Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits     The flashes fell upon them; some lay down     And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest     Their chins upon their clenchéd hands, and smiled;     And others hurried to and fro, and fed     Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up     With mad disquietude on"]]]
