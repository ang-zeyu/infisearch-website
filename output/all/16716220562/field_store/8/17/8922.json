St. John said I was an upstart, a nobody.\"  \"St. John had better mind his own business! It was not cousinly for him to interfere!\" And Marion's face flushed.  \"I suppose he doesn't look at me in the light of a cousin. He considers me an intruder.\"  \"Well, if he won't count you a cousin he need not count me one either--so there!\"  \"But you must not hurt yourself by standing up for me,\" cried Jack hastily.  \"I will not hurt myself--in the eyes of those whose respect is worth considering. In the eyes of the law you are my real brother, for my parents adopted you. St. John must not forget that.\"  \"But tell me of the past, Marion. Where did I come from, and how did I get here?\"  \"It's a long story, Jack. Do you see yonder wreck, on Hemlock Bluff rocks?\"  \"To be sure I do.\"  \"Well, when that wreck came ashore, between ten and eleven years ago, you had been one of the passengers on the boat.\"  \"Me!\"  \"Yes. I have heard mother tell of it several times. It was a fearful night and Old Ben, he was our slave then, was out on the bluff watching. Presently there was the booming of a signal gun--showing the ship was in distress--and soon the ship came in sight, rocking to and fro, with the wild waves running over her deck. Not a soul was left on board, captain and crew having all gone down in the ocean beyond.\"  \"But where did they find me?\"  \"On the beach. Old Ben heard a cry of pain and ran in the direction of the sound. Soon he made out the form of a woman, your mother. She had been hurt by being hit with some wreckage. You were in her arms, and as Old Ben came up you cried out: 'Jack is hungry. Give Jack some bread and butter, please.'\"  \"Yes, yes! I remember something of a storm and of the awful waves. But it's all dreamy-like.\"  \"You were only three or four years old, and the exposure nearly cost you your life. Old Ben took you and your mother to the boathouse and then ran up to the plantation for help. Father went back with him, along with half a dozen men, and they brought you and your mother to the house. I remember that time well, for I was nearly seven years old.\"  \"But my mother, what of her?\" asked Jack impatiently.  \"Poor dear! she died two days later. The physicians did all they could for her, but the shock had been too great, and she passed away without recovering consciousness.\"  \"Then she told nothing about me--who I was?\"  \"No. All she did say while she lived was 'Save my husband! Save my darling little Jack.'\"  \"Then my father must have been on the boat with her?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And they did not find his body?\"  \"No, the only bodies recovered were those of sailors.\"  \"Didn't they try to find out who I was?\"  \"To be sure, but, although father did his best, he could learn nothing. Your father and mother had taken passage on the ship at the last moment and their names did not appear on the list at the shipping offices, and none of the books belonging to the ship itself were ever recovered.\"  \"Perhaps they are on the wreck!\" cried Jack, struck by a sudden idea.  \"No, the wreck was searched from end to end, and all of value taken away.\"  \"I'd like to row over and look around.\"  \"You may do so, Jack. I presume the wreck will have more of an interest than ever for you now.\"  The distance to Hemlock Bluff rocks was a good mile, but Jack soon covered it and, bringing the boat to a safe corner, he assisted Marion out and then leaped out himself.  \"This news is enough to make a fellow's head whirl,\" he observed, as they walked in the direction of the wreck, which lay high up on the beach.  \"I suppose that is true, Jack. But do not let it worry you. You are as dear to mother and me as if you were one of the family.\"  \"But I would like to know who I really am.\"  \"Perhaps time will solve the mystery.\"  Soon the pair were at the wreck, which lay with its bow well up on the rocks and its stern projecting over the sea.  It was no mean task to reach the deck of the wreck, but Jack was a good climber and soon he was aboard. Then he gave Marion a hand up.  The deck of the wreck was much decayed, and they had to be careful how they moved around.  \"I am going below,\" said the youth, after a general look around.  \"Be careful. Jack, or you may break a limb,\" cautioned Marion.  \"I don't suppose you care to go down with me?\"  \"I think not--at least, I will wait until you have been down.\"  Soon Jack was crawling down the rotted companion way. At the bottom all was dirty and dark. He pushed open the door, which hung upon one rusty hinge, and peered into the cabin.  \"I wish I had brought a lantern along,\" he murmured, as he stepped into the compartment.  As Marion had said, the wreck had been cleared of everything of value. All the furniture was gone and the pantries and staterooms were bare. From the cabin he passed into several of the staterooms.  \"What have you found?\" called Marion.  \"Nothing much.\"  \"Any mice down there, or spiders?\"  \"None, so far as I can see.\"  \"Then I'll come down.\"  Soon Marion was beside Jack, and the pair made a tour of the wreck from bow to stern. Their investigations proved to be highly interesting, and they spent more time below than they had anticipated doing.  \"We must get back, Jack,\" said the girl at last.  \"Oh, there is no hurry! Mother is not at home,\" answered Jack. It seemed a bit odd to call Mrs. Ruthven mother now that he knew she was not his relative.  So fully another hour was spent below, moving from one part of the big wreck to another. Presently Jack came to a sudden stop and listened.  \"What a queer noise, Marion!\"  \"It is the wind rising. We had better be getting back, before the bay grows too rough for rowing.\"  \"You are right.\"  Jack ran up the companion way and Marion after him. To their surprise the sky was overcast, and the wind was whipping the surface of the bay into numerous whitecaps.  \"We must lose no time in getting back!\" cried Jack. \"As it is, the wind will be dead against us!\"  As quickly as possible he assisted Marion over the side, and then both set off on a run for the little cove where the rowboat had been left tied up.  As they gained the boat Jack gave an exclamation of dismay.  \"The oars--they are gone!\"  He was right. Marion had shifted their position before leaving the craft, and bumping against the rocks had sent them adrift.     CHAPTER IV.  ON BOARD THE WRECK.   \"Jack, what shall we do now?\" asked Marion, as with a blanched face she gazed into the empty boat.  \"Wait--the oars may be close at hand,\" he replied. \"I will make a search.\"  \"And so will I. Oh, we must find them!\"  They ran up and down the rocky shore, looking far and near for the oars, but without success. Presently they came to a halt, out of breath with running.  \"Gone, sure enough!\" groaned the boy. \"What a pickle we are in now!\"  \"We can't stay here, Jack.\"  \"We'll have to stay here, Marion, unless I can find the oars or make substitutes.\"  \"How are you going to make substitutes?\"  \"I might take some planks from the wreck.\"  \"But you have no tools.\"  \"I have a stout jack-knife.\"  \"It will take a long time, and see, it is already beginning to rain.\"  Marion was right, the rain had started, and as it grew heavier they withdrew to the shelter of the wreck.  \"I wouldn't mind staying here until the shower was over, only I wouldn't want mother to worry about us,\" went on Marion, when they were safe under cover.  \"That's just it. But we do not know if she is home yet.\"  The rain soon increased, while the thunder rolled in the distance. But they felt fairly safe in the cabin of the wreck, and sat down on a bench running along one of the walls.  \"This looks as if it was going to keep up all night,\" observed Jack, an hour later, after another look at the sky from the top of the companion way.  \"Oh, you don't mean we'll have to remain here all night!\" exclaimed Marion.  \"Perhaps, Marion.\"  \"But I do not wish to remain in such a place all night.\"  \"Are you afraid of ghosts?\" and Jack gave a short laugh.  \"No, Jack; but you'll admit it isn't a very nice place.\"  \"I know that. But that isn't the worst of it.\"  \"Not the worst of it?\"  \"No. You must remember that we have nothing to eat or to drink here.\"  \"That is true, but I do not feel much like eating or drinking just now.\"  \"Yes, but you'll be hungry and thirsty before morning, Marion.\"  \"Perhaps. We can drink rain water, if we wish.\"  Another hour passed and the storm grew more violent. The lightning flashed across the sky and lit up the wreck from end to end. Then a blackness as of night followed.  \"We could not row ashore now, even if we had oars,\" observed Marion, as she listened to the howling of the wind.  \"You are right, Marion. My, how it does blow!\"  Suddenly, the sounds of footsteps on the deck of the wreck reached their ears.  \"Somebody is coming!\" said Jack, and looked up the companion way. \"Why, it's Old Ben!\"  He was right; it was Ben the fisherman who had put in an appearance, market basket in hand.  \"Marion! Jack! Am dat yo'?\" came in an anxious voice.  \"Yes, Ben!\" cried both.  \"What brought you?\" continued the boy.  \"I dun thought yo' was a-wantin' ob Ole Ben,\" grinned the colored man. \"I seed yo' rowin' off an' I didn't see yo' cum back, so I says to myself, 'Da is stuck fast on de wreck.' An' den I says, 'Da aint got nuffin to eat.' So ober I comes, an' wid a basketful of good t'ings from de plantation.\" And he held up the market basket. He was soaked from the rain, and the water ran from his clothing in a stream.  \"Ben, you are a jewel!\" burst out Marion and patted his wet coat-sleeve affectionately.  At this the old negro grinned broadly. He had always been a privileged character on the Ruthven plantation,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20432"],["title","Young Captain Jack; Or, The Son of a Soldier (#3)"],["body","being set free had not ended his affection for his former mistress and her children.  \"It was very kind to come over,\" said Jack. \"Does mother know we are here?\"  \"I dun left word dat I was comin' ober an' dat I thought yo' was yeah, sah,\" answered Ben.  He had brought all the good things necessary, along with plates, cups, knives and forks, and soon had the spread ready for them. Then he went off to another part of the wreck to wring out his wet garments.  \"It was very nice of Old Ben to come to us,\" said Marion, while eating. \"It must have been no easy matter to row from the shore to the rocks.\"  \"Ben is as good a boatman as there is in these parts, Marion. It was kind, and he ought to be rewarded for it.\"  \"Mamma will reward him, beyond a doubt.\"  The storm kept increasing in violence, and before the strange meal was disposed of the thunder and lightning were almost incessant. Ben had brought a candle along--knowing the darkness inside of the wreck--and this was all the light they possessed, outside of what Nature afforded.  Ben was just putting the dishes back into the basket when there came an extra heavy flash of lightning, followed immediately by a rending clap of thunder which almost paralyzed Marion and Jack. There was a strange smell in the air, and both found their blood tingling in a manner that was new to them.  \"The wreck--it's been struck by lightning!\" gasped Jack, when he could speak.  \"Dat's a fac'!\" came from Old Ben. \"It was jess like de crack ob doom, wasn't it?\"  He ran on deck, and Jack followed him, with Marion on the bottom of the companion way, not knowing whether to go up or remain below.  The bolt had struck the wreck near the stern, ripping off a large part of the woodwork, and had passed along to one side. Just below the deck line a lively fire was starting up.  \"De wrack am gwine to be burnt up at las'!\" ejaculated Old Ben. \"We has got to git out, Massah Jack!\"  \"Come, Marion!\" called back the boy. \"It's too bad we've got to go out in the rain, but I reckon we can be thankful that our lives have been spared.\"  \"Yes, we can be thankful,\" answered the girl. \"Oh, what a dreadful crack that was! I do not believe I shall ever forget it.\"  She came on deck all in a tremble, and with the others hurried to the bow of the wreck. It was much easier to climb down than to climb up, and soon all three stood upon the rocks below, where the driving rain pelted them mercilessly.  \"I t'ink I can find yo' a bettah place dan dis to stay,\" said Old Ben. \"Come down to de shoah,\" and he led the way to where he had left his boat. With Jack's assistance the craft was hauled out of the water and turned upside down between two large rocks, and then the three crawled under the temporary shelter.  Thus the night passed, and by morning the storm cleared away. Looking toward the wreck they saw that only a small portion of the upper deck had been burned away, the rain having put the fire out before it gained great headway.  It did not take Old Ben and Jack long to launch the former's craft again, and this done, they all entered and the fisherman started to row them to the mainland. Jack's boat was taken in tow.  \"That was certainly quite an adventure,\" observed Jack, as they landed. \"Marion, I reckon you don't want another such.\"  \"No, indeed!\" replied the girl, with a shiver. \"I don't believe I'll ever go over to the old wreck again.\"  \"It's a wondah dat wreck aint busted up long ago,\" put in Old Ben.  \"It's a wonder the poor people around here haven't carried off the wreckage for firewood, Ben,\" said Jack.  \"Da is afraid to do dat, Massah Jack--afraid some ob de sailors wot was drowned might haunt 'em.\"  \"I see. Well, I don't think the wreck will last much longer,\" and with these words Jack turned away to follow Marion to the plantation mansion, to interview his foster mother concerning the particulars of the past. Little did the lad dream of what an important part that old wreck was to play in his future life.     CHAPTER V.  OLD BEN HAS A VISITOR.   St. John Ruthven was a young man of twenty-five, tall, thin, and with a face that was a mixture of craftiness and cowardice. He was the son of a half-brother to the late Colonel Ruthven and could boast of but few of the good traits of Marion's family. He lived on a plantation half a mile from the bay and spent most of his time in attention to his personal appearance and in horseback riding, of which, like many other Southerners, he was passionately fond.  It was commonly supposed that St. John Ruthven was rich, but this was not true. His father had left him a good plantation and some money in the bank, but the young planter was a spendthrift and his mother, who doted on her son, was little better, and soon nearly every dollar which had been left by the husband and father had slipped through their fingers. More than this, St. John took but little interest in the plantation, which gradually ran down until it became almost worthless.  \"St. John, my dear, we must do something,\" the mother would say, in her helpless way. \"We cannot live like this forever.\"  \"What shall I do?\" would be the son's reply. \"The plantation isn't worth working and I have no money with which to buy another place. The niggers are getting so they are not worth their keep.\"  \"But you told me yesterday that we had less than a thousand dollars left in the bank.\"  \"It's true, too.\"  \"What do you propose doing when that is gone?\"  \"Oh! our credit is still good,\" was the lofty answer.  \"But that won't last forever, St. John.\"  \"Something may turn up.\"  \"Everything seems to prosper at Alice's place,\" went on Mrs. Mary Ruthven, referring to the home of Marion and Jack.  \"I know that.\"  \"And we are continually running behind. St. John, you ought to get after the niggers and other help.\"  \"I wasn't cut out for work, mother,\" was the sour answer.  \"But we really must do something,\" was the half-desperate response.  \"I've got an idea in my head, mother. If it works, we'll be all right.\"  \"What is the idea?\"  \"I think a good deal of Marion. Why shouldn't we marry and join the two plantations? That would give us both a good living.\"  \"I have thought of such a plan myself, St. John. But there may be an objection.\"  \"Do you think Marion would refuse me?\"  \"She might. In some respects Alice's daughter is rather peculiar.\"  \"But I don't see why she should refuse me. Am I not her equal in social position?\"  \"What a question! Of course you are. Still she may have her eyes set upon somebody else.\"  \"I know of nobody. Marion is still young.\"  \"Have you sounded her on the subject?\"  \"Not yet, but I will soon. She has Jack around so much I never get half a chance to talk to her.\"  \"Always that boy! When I visited Alice last I declare she talked of that nobody the whole time,--what a wonderful man she hoped he would make,--and all that. Just as if he was her own flesh and blood!\" and Mrs. Mary Ruthven tossed her head disdainfully.  \"She was foolish to allow that nobody to think himself a Ruthven. But I have put a spoke into his wheel, I reckon.\"  \"What do you mean? Did you tell Jack the truth?\"  \"Not exactly. But I gave a pretty broad hint to his intimate friend Darcy Gilbert, and Darcy, of course, will carry the news straight to Jack.\"  \"Oh, St. John! that may cause trouble. Your aunt wished to keep the truth from the boy as long as possible. She told me she did not wish to hurt his feelings.\"  \"He had to learn the truth sooner or later. Besides, I didn't want him to think himself a Ruthven and the equal of Marion and myself,\" went on St. John loftily.  There was a moment of silence and Mrs. Mary Ruthven gave a long sigh.  \"Well, I would not delay speaking to Marion too long,\" she observed. \"Something must be done, that's sure, and if you wait, Marion and her mother may find out how hard up we really are, and then Marion may refuse you on that account.\"  \"I shall see her before long,\" answered the son.  He had his mind bent on a horseback ride, and was soon in the saddle and off on a road leading along the shore of the bay. He hoped to find Marion in the vicinity of the old boathouse, but when he arrived there nobody was in sight but Old Ben, who was mending one of his fishing nets.  \"Ha, Ben! are you alone?\" he said, as he dismounted and came into the boathouse.  \"Yes, Massah St. John, I'm alone unless there's some ghostes hidin' around yeah!\" and the old negro smiled broadly. He understood St. John's character pretty thoroughly and despised him accordingly.  \"I thought Marion might be around here.\"  \"She aint been yeah to-day, sah. She an' Jack was out on de bay in dat awful storm yesterday and I reckon it was most too much fo' dem.\"  \"Out in that awful storm! It's a wonder the boat didn't upset.\"  \"Da was ober to de wrack when de big blow came.\"  \"Did they stay there?\"  \"I went ober after 'em an' da come in dis mornin', Massah St. John.\"  \"Humph! I am surprised that my aunt should trust Marion with that boy.\"  \"Why not, Massah St. John? Jack can manage a boat as well as I can.\"  St. John tossed his head and flung himself down upon a seat. \"I think my aunt makes a fool of herself about that boy. Who is he, anyway? He's only an ocean waif; of low birth, very probably.\"  \"Dat he isn't!\" said Old Ben indignantly. \"He's a young gen'man, Jack is, an' so was his father.\"  \"Bah! what do you know about his father?\"  \"He couldn't be Jack's father without bein' a gen'man--dat's wot I know,\" went on Ben stoutly. \"Why, look at de deah chile! How noble an'--an'--handsome he is!\"  \"Oh, pshaw, Ben! you had better stick to your nets. What do you know about a gentleman?\"  \"I knows one when I sees one, Massah St. John,\" was the somewhat suggestive response.  \"Oh, do you? And I know an impudent nigger when I see one!\" cried St. John angrily.  \"No offense, Massah St. John.\"  \"Then be a little more careful of what you say.\" St. John tugged at the ends of his stubby mustache. \"I wish I had that boy under my care,\" he went on.  \"S'po"]]]
