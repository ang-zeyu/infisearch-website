Marian had been so excited over her novel employment that she had not seen what damage the briars were doing till Marjorie laughed out: \"Oh, what a rag-bag you are!\"  Then Marian looked down at the fringe of muslin which hung from her waist, at the stained waist itself, from which the trimming fell in festoons, and she was aghast. \"Oh, what shall I do?\" she breathed helplessly.  \"You certainly do look a sight,\" said Stella, none too comfortingly, \"but I wouldn't mind my clothes so much as my hands; just see how they are all scratched up, and your face isn't much better. You were too reckless; you ought not to have plunged in so far that you got caught in the worst of the brambles; we didn't any of us plunge around so as to get all mixed up that way.\"  \"I know,\" returned Marian meekly, \"I got too excited.\"  \"I should think you did.\"  \"I can't go into town this way,\" said Marian miserably. \"I look like a beggar girl.\"  \"Anybody could see that you had been picking blackberries,\" said Alice consolingly.  \"But with such a looking frock they will laugh at me,\" said Marian tearfully. \"Oh, dear, I wish I had worn something that didn't tear.\"  \"As the rest of us did,\" remarked Marjorie complacently.  \"If you had only been careful and had kept on the edge of the thicket,\" Stella said, then seeing how distressed Marian really was, she went on: \"You might take off your frock; I really think you would look better without than with it.\"  \"Oh!\" Marian's cheeks flamed. To appear before the world half-dressed was not to be thought of.  Stella looked her over critically. The frock she wore was a white muslin spotted with pink, too frail a garment for such an expedition.  \"The waist isn't so terrible,\" said Alice examining it. \"If we had some pins we could fasten the trimming on so it wouldn't show the tears much.\"  \"Take off your frock, Marian,\" decided Stella; \"I know what we can do.\"  Marian obeyed the assured voice, and presently Stella was tearing the ragged skirt from the waist, afterward pinning the trimming of the waist in place. \"Now come here,\" she said to Marian.  \"What are you going to do?\" the others asked in chorus.  \"I am going to match your petticoat to your waist,\" said Stella, addressing Marian. \"I will dot it with pink, and it will never be observed. You can wear the waist as it is, and have a skirt to match.\"  \"What are you going to spot it with?\" asked Alice curiously.  \"You'll see,\" answered her sister, taking a blackberry from her basket and squeezing a little of the juice on Marian's petticoat. \"It isn't exactly the color, but it is near enough, and will never be noticed unless you were very near. Now stand quite still, Marian.\"  The little girl obeyed and after some time Stella finished her work. \"There!\" she exclaimed with her head to one side to notice the effect; \"that is not bad at all. Walk off, Marian, and let me see; the spots aren't quite even, but then, as Mrs. Hunt says, 'they will never be seen on a galloping horse.'\"  \"I am sure they look very well,\" remarked Alice admiringly, \"and I think you were very clever to think of it, Stella.\" And Marian, though still a little shamefaced, felt more at ease.  \"We'd better start back,\" said Stella, \"for the afternoons are not so very long now, and we have quite a distance to go.\"  \"If we didn't have blackberries in the two buckets we might get some of that nice cold water from the spring and carry it with us,\" said Alice, \"and then if we were thirsty we should have something to drink.\"  \"It wouldn't be a bad plan,\" agreed Stella. \"I'll tell you what we can do: Marjorie can pour her berries in our bucket and we can use hers for the water. Our bucket is so big that it will easily hold ours and hers, too.\"  \"I'd like to see me do it,\" spoke up Marjorie. \"I'd be sure not to get back as many as I put in.\"  Stella curled her lip and lifted her eyebrows scornfully. \"You needn't be afraid,\" she said; \"nobody wants one of your old berries. If you are so particular, it is very easy to separate them by putting a layer of leaves on top of ours, and yours on top of that, and then there will be no mixing, and _we_ shall be sure to get all that belongs to _us_.\"  Marjorie agreed to this arrangement, being quite ready to have a supply of water on hand, and so Stella carefully arranged the berries and said she would carry the bucket herself and that Marjorie and Alice could take turns in carrying the water. So, after everything was adjusted, they set off toward the town, following the dusty road by which they had come.  The way home did not seem as long as the morning's walk, and not a great deal of time had passed when the spires of the village churches appeared in the distance, then they reached the outlying houses, and finally the main street. \"I'd just kite up the back way if I were you,\" said Stella to Marian; \"it is a little bit shorter and you won't be likely to meet so many people. Good-bye. We turn off here, you know. I hope you won't get a scolding.\"  The fear of this, or worse, had been in Marian's heart all along, though she had not mentioned it, and as she stole in the back gate and up the garden walk she hoped she would meet neither her grandmother nor Heppy. The little bucket of blackberries no longer seemed worth while, and she set it down near the apple tree, ran in the side door, past her grandfather's study, and on up-stairs, hoping she could get by the sitting-room without being seen.  But her hopes were in vain, for on the landing appeared her grandmother. \"Is that you, Marian?\" she asked. \"Where have you been all day? Come in here and give an account of yourself.\"  For a second it was in Marian's thought to say that her nose was bleeding and to make her escape to her room, change her frock and then reappear, but she knew it was only putting off the evil day, for the frock's condition would be discovered sooner or later; and then she was a truthful child, and could not have brought herself to make a false excuse, even though the outcome might have been better for her. So she entered the sitting-room timidly and stood with drooping head before her grandmother.  \"Where have you been all day?\" repeated her grandmother.  \"Oh, didn't Mrs. Hunt tell you?\" said Marian in a weak voice. \"She said she would. I've been blackberrying.\"  \"With whom?\"  \"Some of the girls.\"  \"Who gave you permission?\"  \"Why--why--Mrs. Hunt didn't think you would mind, and--and----\"  \"Blackberrying! I should think so,\" exclaimed Mrs. Otway. \"What a sight you are, all stained and scratched up. Go, wash your face and hands.\"  \"I did try to get it off at the spring,\" returned Marian more cheerfully, hoping she was to be let off rather easily after all.  But she had not reached the door before her grandmother called her back. \"What in the world have you done to your frock?\" she asked, examining her costume in surprise.  \"It got torn so and I was so ragged that Stella tore off the skirt,\" said Marian in faint explanation, \"and--\" she went on, \"she thought she would try to make my petticoat look like a frock; the spots are blackberry juice; they aren't quite the same color, but we all thought they looked pretty well, better than slits and snags.\"  \"Then you have ruined not only your frock but your petticoat. Go to your room and do not come out till I tell you. I will speak to your grandfather and we will see what is to be done about this,\" said her grandmother in such a severe tone that Marian felt like the worst of criminals and crept to her room in dread distress.  She had not often been seriously punished, but those few times stood out very clearly just now. Once she had been compelled to receive ten sharp strokes from a ruler on her outstretched hand. At another time she had been shut up in a dark closet, and again she had been tied in a chair for some hours. Any of these was bad enough. The first was soonest over, but was the most humiliating, the second was terrifying and nerve racking, while the third tediously long and hard to bear. For some time the child sat tremblingly listening for her grandmother's footsteps, but evidently Mrs. Otway did not intend to use undue haste in the matter. After a while the whistle of the evening train announced that those who had gone up to the city for a day's shopping were now returning, and not long after Miss Dorothy's door opened and Marian could hear the teacher singing softly to herself in the next room.  A new humiliation filled the child's breast. They would tell Miss Dorothy, and she would think of her little friend as some one desperately wicked, too wicked, no doubt, to associate with Patty. The tears stood in Marian's eyes at this possibility. It was very, very wrong, of course, to go off without asking leave, and it was worse to spoil her clothes. She well knew her grandmother's views upon this subject, and that of all things she disapproved of wastefulness. She would say that the clothes might have done good to the poor; they might have been sent in a missionary box to some needy child, and it was wicked and selfish to deprive the poor of something that could be of use.  Oh, yes, Marian knew very well all about the probable lecture in store for her.  She sat dolefully, with clasped hands and tearful eyes. But presently a happier thought came to her. She would tell Miss Dorothy before her grandmother had a chance to do so, and perhaps Miss Dorothy would understand that she had not meant to do wrong in the first place, and that what came after was carelessness and not wilful wickedness. She had been ordered not to leave her room, and this she need not do to carry out her plan. So she softly crossed the floor and timidly knocked at the door between Miss Dorothy's room and her own. It was opened in a moment by her friend, who viewed the forlorn little figure first with a smile, and then with anxious interest. \"Why, my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19988"],["title","Little Maid Marian (#8)"],["body","ie,\" she exclaimed, \"what is the matter? Come into my room and tell me what is wrong.\"  \"I can't come in,\" said Marian in a low tone, \"for I mustn't leave my room till grandma bids me. But you can come in mine, can't you?\" she added wistfully.  \"To be sure I can,\" and suiting the action to the word, Miss Dorothy entered and sat down by the window, drawing Marian to her side and saying, \"Now tell me all about it.\"  Marian poured forth her doleful tale, beginning with the visit to Mrs. Hunt and ending with the interview with her grandmother. \"She wouldn't have minded so much except for the frock and petticoat,\" she said in conclusion, \"but when she found out about those, I could see that she was very, very much put out.\"  \"That was the worst part of it, of course,\" said Miss Dorothy. \"Of course you told her how sorry you were, and that you were so excited over getting the biggest berries that you forgot about the briars. You are not the only one who has done that,\" she added with a half smile. \"You never had been blackberrying before, had you?\"  \"No, Miss Dorothy, and it was very exciting. We really had a lovely time, only the walk was rather a hot one. Mrs. Hunt was so good; she gave me such a fine lunch. She didn't think grandma would mind, for she said she often used to go blackberrying when she was a little girl.\"  \"She said that, did she?\"  \"Yes, Miss Dorothy. I ought to return the basket, but I can't go now, and I left the berries down under the apple tree.\"  \"I will go out and bring them in, and I was thinking of going to Mrs. Hunt's to make a call. I may as well go this evening, and then I can return the basket for you. Mr. Hunt is one of our trustees, you know, and I want to see him on a little matter about the school.\"  \"Oh, thank you, Miss Dorothy. I know she uses that little basket for all sorts of things, and she might want it.\"  \"She shall have it,\" said Miss Dorothy. \"Well, dear, I hope your grandmother will not be very hard on you. The only point I can see that needs blame, is your wearing that flimsy delicate frock, but as you had never been blackberrying before, you couldn't know the unkindness of briars.\"  \"There wasn't time to change the frock.\"  \"Yes, I know.\"  \"And you won't think I am very, very, wicked, even if they punish me? You will let Patty be friends with me?\"  \"I understand all about it, my dearie, and it shall not make the slightest difference so far as Patty is concerned. I only wish I could take your punishment for you.\"  At this extreme kindness, Marian flung herself upon the floor at Miss Dorothy's feet and sobbed aloud, \"You are so dear! you are so dear!\"  Miss Dorothy lifted her to her lap, smoothed back her hair and kissed her flushed cheeks. \"Cheer up, dear,\" she said. \"One need not be unhappy forever, and I hope this will soon be all over. Now, I must go down and get those berries, or it will be too dark to find them. Don't cry any more,\" and with a smile Miss Dorothy left her.  It was quite dark when Mrs. Otway at last appeared. \"I have talked it over with your grandfather,\" she began without preface, \"and we have decided to punish you by having you wear to school all next week the costume you came home in. That is all we shall do. It will teach you to be more careful next time. You may come down to supper now,\" and Marian meekly followed.  The blackberries were on the table, but Marian could not touch them. The horror of appearing before her schoolmates in the spotted petticoat filled her with dismay, and although her grandmother felt that she had been really very lenient, no punishment she could have devised would have been more humiliating to the little girl. She had always been a very dainty child, taking pride in her clothes and being glad that she could appear as well as any one she knew. How could she face nineteen pairs of wondering eyes upon Monday morning? She could see the amused countenances, hear the suppressed giggles, and imagine the laughing comments whispered with hands hiding mouths. If only she could fall sick and die so she might never go to school again.  No one paid much attention to her as she sat there barely tasting her supper, though she should have been hungry after her long walk and her early lunch. Miss Dorothy once or twice looked her way and nodded reassuringly, while Heppy slipped an extra large piece of cake on her plate as she was passing it around.  But after Marian had gone to bed and was lying forlornly awake, after an hour of trying to sleep, Miss Dorothy tiptoed into her room to bend over her, and seeing the wide eyes, to say: \"I have been down to Mrs. Hunt's. She is a dear. Go to sleep, honey. Just have faith that it will all come out right. Don't worry. I am going to leave my door open so you will not feel that you are all alone.\" And with a kiss she left her to feel somehow quite satisfied that matters were not so desperate as they seemed, and that Monday's trial might in some way be set aside if she had faith.     _CHAPTER VI_  _The White Apron_   But Monday morning came and there seemed no prospect of any change in Mrs. Otway's decision. She came herself to see that Marian was clad in the costume of disgrace, and she was sternly sent out with the order not to be late. But lest she should shame Miss Dorothy the child lingered out of sight around the corner till her teacher should have passed by and then she ventured down the street by herself. No one imagined the agony each step cost her, nor how she avoided any familiar face, crossing and recrossing as she saw an acquaintance in the distance. She was even about to pass Mrs. Hunt's gate without looking up when some one called her.  \"Marian, Marian,\" came Mrs. Hunt's pleasant voice. \"Stop a minute, chickadee.\"  The first impulse was to run on, but that meant reaching the schoolhouse so much the sooner, so the child hesitated and presently was captured by Mrs. Hunt, who bore down upon her as one not to be denied.  \"I've been watching for you,\" she said. \"Come right along in. You have plenty of time. I have something to say to you. There, never mind, I know the whole story and I ought to have all the blame, for it was myself that urged you to go. Now your grandma never said you were not to cover up that ridiculous petticoat, did she? She said you were to wear it, I know, and wear it you must, of course.  \"Now, look here, I have an apron that was my little angel Annie's; it's a real pretty one, and it is made so it will cover you all up. I hunted it out this morning early. Put your arms in the sleeves. That's it. Just as I thought; it covers you well up and hides all the spots, doesn't it? It is a little yellow from lying, but no matter, it is clean and smooth. I've two or three more the same pattern. I always liked 'em with those little frills on the shoulders.  \"Now, never mind, I know just what you're going to say, but you needn't. I'm taking all the responsibility of this. Just you go along to school and feel as happy as you can. I'm going to see your grandmother before you get home, and I'll make it all right with her, so you are not to bother yourself one little mite. Now trot along, and hurry a little, or you might be a wee bit late. You can wear the apron home. You look real nice in it.\"  Marian started forth as she was bidden, and then overwhelmed by her sense of relief, she raced back to throw her arms around her good friend's neck and say, \"Oh, you are so good. I do love you, I do. What should I do without you and Miss Dorothy?\"  \"Bless her heart,\" murmured Mrs. Hunt, giving her a hearty hug. She stood in the doorway, looking after her till she was out of sight. \"I never expected to be so happy in seeing another child wear anything of my Annie's,\" she murmured, wiping her eyes as she entered the house.  The girls were trooping into the schoolroom from the playground when Marian reached the spot, and Miss Dorothy was already at her desk. She looked across and gave Marian a bright smile and an understanding nod as she came in, as much as to say: \"What did I tell you? Hasn't it all come out right?\" As hers was not the only apron worn, Marian did not feel at all oddly dressed, and her relief was so great that she smiled every time any one looked at her.  Alice sought her out at recess and asked eagerly: \"Was your grandmother awfully mad?\"  \"She didn't like it,\" returned Marian evasively.  \"What did she do?\"  \"She didn't do anything. She sent me to my room.\"  \"Was that all? Well, I'm glad you came off so easily,\" said Alice. \"We all know how particular your grandmother is, and we were afraid she would do something awfully severe.\" Then Ruth came up and Marian went off with her to eat luncheon, so no more was said on the subject.  \"Mrs. Hunt told me I could wear it home,\" said Marian to herself, as she went up street from school. She was alone, for Miss Dorothy had been detained and had told her not to wait. Marian paused at Mrs. Hunt's gate to see if she were there to give her further encouragement, for as she was nearing home, the child felt her spirits oozing. What would her grandmother say? She remembered, however, that Mrs. Hunt had charged her not to worry, so, finding all silent and deserted at her friend's house, she plucked up courage, believing that Mrs. Hunt had not failed her, and that she was probably at that very moment, closeted with her grandmother.  She was not disappointed, for as she entered the sitting-room she saw the two having a lively chat. \"Here comes the child,\" cried Mrs. Hunt cheerily. \"We were just talking over old times, Marian. I was reminding your grandmother of the time we all went nutting to Jones's lot, and she fell into a mud-hole and was plastered to her ears. She had to sit in the sun till she dried off, and then I took her home. My mother rigged her up in some of my clothes, and she went home with her heart in her mouth.\" Marian smiled. She understood the method Mrs. Hunt was taking to smooth matters over for herself.  \"Another time,\""]]]
