That Christmas Day virtually began a whole year beforehand, with a red-hot letter written by Guy Fernald to his younger sister, Nan, who had been married to Samuel Burnett just two and one-half years. The letter was read aloud by Mrs. Burnett to her husband at the breakfast table, the second day after Christmas. From start to finish it was upon one subject, and it read as follows:  DEAR NAN:       It's a confounded, full-grown shame that not a soul of us      all got home for Christmas--except yours truly, and he only      for a couple of hours. What have the blessed old folks done      to us that we treat them like this? I was invited to the      Sewalls' for the day, and went, of course--you know why. We      had a ripping time, but along toward evening I began to feel      worried. I really thought Ralph was home--he wrote me that      he might swing round that way by the holidays--but I knew      the rest of you were all wrapped up in your own Christmas      trees and weren't going to get there.       Well, I took the seven-thirty down and walked in on them.      Sitting all alone by the fire, by George, just like the      pictures you see of \"The Birds All Flown,\" and that sort of      thing. I felt gulpish in my throat, on my honour I did, when      I looked at them. Mother just gave one gasp and flew into my      arms, and Dad got up more slowly--he has that darned      rheumatism worse than ever this winter--and came over and I      thought he'd shake my hand off. Well--I sat down between      them by the fire, and pretty soon I got down in the old way      on a cushion by mother, and let her run her fingers through      my hair, the way she used to--and Nan, I'll be indicted for      perjury if her hand wasn't trembly. They were so glad to      see me it made my throat ache.       Ralph had written he couldn't get round, and of course you'd      all written and sent them things--jolly things, and they      appreciated them. But--blame it all--they were just dead      lonesome--and the whole outfit of us within three hundred      miles, most within thirty!       Nan--next Christmas it's going to be different. That's all I      say. I've got it all planned out. The idea popped into my      head when I came away last night. Not that they had a word      of blame--not they. They understood all about the children,      and the cold snap, and Ed's being under the weather, and      Oliver's wife's neuralgia, and Ralph's girl in the West, and      all that. But that didn't make the thing any easier for      them. As I say, next year--But you'll all hear from me then.      Meanwhile--run down and see them once or twice this winter,      will you, Nan? Somehow it struck me they aren't so young      as--they used to be.       Splendid winter weather. Margaret Sewall's a peach, but I      don't seem to make much headway. My best to Sam.  Your affectionate brother,  GUY.  Gay Nan had felt a slight choking in her own throat as she read this letter. \"We really must make an effort to be there Christmas next year, Sam,\" she said to her husband, and Sam assented cheerfully. He only wished there were a father and mother somewhere in the world for him to go home to.  Guy wrote the same sort of thing, with more or less detail, to Edson and Oliver, his married elder brothers; to Ralph, his unmarried brother; and to Carolyn--Mrs. Charles Wetmore, his other--and elder--married sister. He received varied and more or less sympathetic responses, to the effect that with so many little children, and such snowdrifts as always blocked the roads leading toward North Estabrook, it really was not strange--and of course somebody would go next year. But they had all sent the nicest gifts they could find. Didn't Guy think mother liked those beautiful Russian sables Ralph sent her? And wasn't father pleased with his gold-headed cane from Oliver? Surely with such presents pouring in from all the children, Father and Mother Fernald couldn't feel so awfully neglected.  \"Gold-headed cane be hanged!\" Guy exploded when he read this last sentence from the letter of Marian, Oliver's wife. \"I'll bet she put him up to it. If anybody dares give me a gold-headed cane before I'm ninety-five I'll thrash him with it on the spot. He wasn't using it, either--bless him. He had his old hickory stick, and he wouldn't have had that if that abominable rheumatism hadn't gripped him so hard. He isn't old enough to use a cane, by jolly, and Ol ought to know it, if Marian doesn't. I'm glad I sent him that typewriter. He liked that, I know he did, and it'll amuse him, too--not make him think he's ready to die!\"  Guy was not the fellow to forget anything which had taken hold of him as that pathetic Christmas home-coming had done. When the year had nearly rolled around, the first of December saw him at work getting his plans in train. He began with his eldest brother, Oliver, because he considered Mrs. Oliver the hardest proposition he had to tackle in the carrying out of his idea.  \"You see,\" he expounded patiently, as they sat and stared at him, \"it isn't that they aren't always awfully glad to see the whole outfit, children and all, but it just struck me it would do 'em a lot of good to revive old times. I thought if we could make it just as much as possible like one of the old Christmases before anybody got married--hang up the stockings and all, you know--it would give them a mighty jolly surprise. I plan to have us all creep in in the night and go to bed in our old rooms. And then in the morning--See?\"  Mrs. Oliver looked at him. An eager flush lit his still boyish face--Guy was twenty-eight--and his blue eyes were very bright. His lithe, muscular figure bent toward her pleadingly; all his arguments were aimed at her. Oliver sat back in his impassive way and watched them both. It could not be denied that it was Marian's decisions which usually ruled in matters of this sort.  \"It seems to me a very strange plan,\" was Mrs. Oliver's comment, when Guy had laid the whole thing before her in the most tactful manner he could command. She spoke rather coldly. \"It is not usual to think that families should be broken up like this on Christmas Day, of all days in the year. Four families, with somebody gone--a mother or a father--just to please two elderly people who expect nothing of the sort, and who understand just why we can't all get home at once. Don't you think you are really asking a good deal?\"  Guy kept his temper, though it was hard work. \"It doesn't seem to me I am,\" he answered quite gently. \"It's only for once. I really don't think father and mother would care much what sort of presents we brought them, if we only came ourselves. Of course, I know I'm asking a sacrifice of each family, and it may seem almost an insult not to invite the children and all, yet--perhaps next year we'll try a gathering of all the clans. But just for this year--honestly--I do awfully wish you'd give me my way. If you'd seen those two last Christmas--\"  He broke off, glancing appealingly at Oliver himself. To his surprise, that gentleman shifted his pipe to the corner of his mouth and put a few pertinent questions to his younger brother. Had he thought it all out? What time should they arrive there? How early on the day after Christmas could they get away? Was he positive they could all crowd into the house without rousing and alarming the pair?  \"Sure thing,\" Guy declared, quickly. \"Marietta--well, you know I've had the soft side of her old heart ever since I was born, somehow. I talked it all over with her last year, and I'm solid with her, all right. She'll work the game. You see, father's quite a bit deaf now--\"  \"Father deaf?\"  \"Sure. Didn't you know it?\"  \"Forgotten. But mother'd hear us.\"  \"No, she wouldn't. Don't you know how she trusts everything about the house to Marietta since she got that fall--\"  \"Mother get a fall?\"  \"Why, _yes_!\" Guy stared at his brother with some impatience. \"Don't you remember she fell down the back stairs a year ago last October, and hurt her knee?\"  \"Certainly, Oliver,\" his wife interposed. \"I wrote for you to tell her how sorry we were. But I supposed she had entirely recovered.\"  \"She's a little bit lame, and always will be,\" said Guy, a touch of reproach in his tone. \"Her knee stiffens up in the night, and she doesn't get up and go prowling about at the least noise, the way she used to. Marietta won't let her. So if we make a whisper of noise Marietta'll tell her it's the cat or something. Good Lord! yes--it can be worked all right. The only thing that worries me is the fear that I can't get"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20187"],["title","On Christmas Day in the Morning (#1)"],["body","all to take hold of the scheme. On my word, Ol,\"--he turned quite away from his sister-in-law's critical gaze and faced his brother with something like indignation in his frank young eyes--\"don't we owe the old home anything but a present tied up in tissue paper once a year?\"  Marian began to speak. She thought Guy was exceeding his rights in talking as if they had been at fault. It was not often that elderly people had so many children within call--loyal children who would do anything within reason. But certainly a man owed something to his own family. And at Christmas! Why not carry out this plan at some other--  Her husband abruptly interrupted her. He took his pipe quite out of his mouth and spoke decidedly.  \"Guy, I believe you're right. I'll be sorry to desert my own kids, of course, but I rather think they can stand it for once. If the others fall into line, you may count on me.\"  Guy got away, feeling that the worst of his troubles was over. In his younger sister, Nan, he hoped to find an ardent ally and he was not disappointed. Carolyn--Mrs. Charles Wetmore--also fell in heartily with the plan. Ralph, from somewhere in the far West, wrote that he would get home or break a leg. Edson thought the idea rather a foolish one, but was persuaded by Jessica, his wife--whom Guy privately declared a trump--that he must go by all means. And so they all fell into line, and there remained for Guy only the working out of the details.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Mis' Fernald\"--Marietta Cooley strove with all the decision of which she was capable to keep her high-pitched, middle-aged voice in order--\"'fore you get to bed I'm most forgettin' what I was to ask you. I s'pose you'll laugh, but Guy--he wrote me partic'lar he wanted you and his father to\"--Marietta's rather stern, thin face took on a curious expression--\"to hang up your stockin's.\"  Mrs. Fernald paused in the door-way of the bedroom opening from the sitting-room downstairs. She looked back at Marietta with her gentle smile.  \"Guy wrote that?\" she asked. \"Then--it almost looks as if he might be coming himself, doesn't it, Marietta?\"  \"Well, I don't know's I'd really expect him,\" Marietta replied, turning her face away and busying herself about the hearth. \"I guess what he meant was more in the way of a surprise for a Christmas present--something that'll go into a stockin', maybe.\"  \"It's rather odd he should have written you to ask me,\" mused Mrs. Fernald, as she looked out the stockings.  Marietta considered rapidly. \"Well, I s'pose he intended for me to get 'em on the sly without mentionin' it to you, an' put in what he sent, but I sort of guessed you might like to fall in with his idee by hangin' 'em up yourself, here by the chimbley, where the children all used to do it. Here's the nails, same as they always was.\"  Mrs. Fernald found the stockings, and touched her husband on the shoulder, as he sat unlacing his shoes. \"Father, Guy wrote he wanted us to hang up our stockings,\" she said, raising her voice a little and speaking very distinctly. The elderly man beside her looked up, smiling.  \"Well, well,\" he said, \"anything to please the boy. It doesn't seem more than a year since he was a little fellow hanging up his own stocking, does it, mother?\"  The stockings were hung in silence. They looked thin and lonely as they dangled beside the dying fire. Marietta hastened to make them less lonely. \"Well,\" she said, in a shame-faced way, \"the silly boy said I was to hang mine, too. Goodness knows what he'll find to put into it that'll fit, 'less it's a poker.\"  They smiled kindly at her, wished her good night, and went back into their own room. The little episode had aroused no suspicions. It was very like Guy's affectionate boyishness.  \"I presume he'll be down,\" said Mrs. Fernald, as she limped quietly about the room, making ready for bed. \"Don't you remember how he surprised us last year? I'm sorry the others can't come. Of course, I sent them all the invitation, just as usual--I shall always do that--but it _is_ pretty snowy weather, and I suppose they don't quite like to risk it.\"  Presently, as she was putting out the light, she heard Marietta at the door.  \"Mis' Fernald, Peter Piper's got back in this part o' the house, somehow, and I can't lay hands on him. Beats all how cute that cat is. Seem's if he knows when I'm goin' to put him out in the wood-shed. I don't think likely he'll do no harm, but I thought I'd tell you, so 'f you heard any queer noises in the night you'd know it was Peter.\"  \"Very well, Marietta\"--the soft voice came back to the schemer on the other side of the door. \"Peter will be all right, wherever he is. I shan't be alarmed if I hear him.\"  \"All right, Mis' Fernald; I just thought I'd let you know,\" and the guileful one went grinning away.         *       *       *       *       *  _There was a long silence in the quiet sleeping-room. Then, out of the darkness, came this little colloquy:_  _\"Emeline, you aren't getting to sleep.\"_  _\"I--know I'm not, John. I--Christmas Eve keeps one awake, somehow. It always did.\"_  _\"Yes.... I don't suppose the children realise at all, do they?\"_  _\"Oh, no--oh, no! They don't realise--they never will, till--they're here themselves. It's all right. I think--I think at least Guy will be down to-morrow, don't you?\"_  _\"I guess maybe he will.\" Then, after a short silence. \"Mother--you've got me, you know. You know--you've always got me, dear.\"_  _\"Yes.\" She would not let him hear the sob in her voice. She crept close, and spoke cheerfully in his best ear. \"And you've got me, Johnny Boy!\"_  _\"Thank the Lord, I have!\"_  _So, counting their blessings, they fell asleep at last. But, even in sleep, one set of lashes was strangely wet._         *       *       *       *       *  \"Christopher Jinks, what a drift!\"  \"Lucky we weren't two hours later.\"  \"_Sh-h_--they might hear us.\"  \"Nan, stop laughing, or I'll drop a snowball down your neck!\"  \"Here, Carol, give me your hand. I'll plough you through. Large bodies move slowly, of course, but go elbows first and you'll get there.\"  \"Gee _whiz_! Can't you get that door open? I'll bet it's frozen fast.\"  A light showed inside the kitchen. The storm-door swung open, propelled by force from inside. A cautious voice said low: \"That the Fernald family?\"  A chorus of whispers came back at Miss Marietta Cooley:  \"Yes, yes--let us in, we're freezing.\"  \"You bet we're the Fernald family--every man-Jack of us--not one missing.\"  \"Oh, Marietta--you dear old thing!\"  \"Hurry up--this is their side of the house.\"  \"_Sh-h-h_--\"  \"Carol, your _sh-h-ishes_ would wake the dead!\"  [Illustration: \"STUMBLING OVER THEIR OWN FEET AND BUNDLES ... THE CREW POURED INTO THE WARM KITCHEN\"]  Stumbling over their own feet and bundles in the endeavour to be preternaturally quiet, the crew poured into the warm kitchen. Bearded Oliver, oldest of the clan; stout Edson, big Ralph, tall and slender Guy--and the two daughters of the house, Carolyn, growing plump and rosy at thirty; Nan, slim and girlish at twenty-four--they were all there. Marietta heaved a sigh of content as she looked them over.  \"Well, I didn't really think you'd get here--all of you. Thank the Lord, you have. I s'pose you're tearin' hungry, bein' past 'leven. If you think you can eat quiet as cats, I'll feed you up, but if you're goin' to make as much rumpus as you did comin' round the corner o' the wood-shed I'll have to pack you straight off to bed up the back stairs.\"  They pleaded for mercy and hot food. They got it--everything that could be had that would diffuse no odour of cookery through the house. Smoking clam-broth, a great pot of baked beans, cold meats, and jellies--they had no reason to complain of their reception. They ate hungrily with the appetites of winter travel.  \"Say, but this is great,\" exulted Ralph, the stalwart, consuming a huge wedge of mince pie with a fine disregard for any consequences that might overtake him. \"This alone is worth it. I haven't eaten such pie in a century. What a jolly place this old kitchen is! Let's have a candy-pull to-morrow. I haven't been home Christmas in--let me see--by Jove, I believe it's six--seven--yes, seven years. Look here: there's been some excuse for me, but what about you people that live near?\"  He looked accusingly about. Carolyn got up and came around to him. \"Don't talk about it to-night,\" she whispered. \"We haven't any of us realised how long it's been.\"  \"We'll get off to bed now,\" Guy declared, rising. \"I can't get over the feeling that they may catch us down here. If either of them should want some hot water or anything--\"  \"The dining-room door's bolted,\" Marietta assured him, \"but it might need explainin' if I had to bring 'em hot water by way of the parlour. Now, go awful careful up them stairs. They're pretty near over your ma's head, but I don't dare have you tramp through the settin'-room to the front ones. Now, remember that seventh stair creaks like Ned--you've got to step right on the outside edge of it to keep it quiet. I don't know but what you boys better step right up over that seventh stair without touchin' foot to it.\"  \"All right--we'll step!\"  \"Who's going to fix the bundles?\" Carolyn paused to ask as she started up the stairs.  \"Marietta,\" Guy answered. \"I've labeled every one, so it'll be easy. If they hear paper rattle, they'll think it's the usual presents we've sent on, and if they come out they'll see Marietta, so it's all right. Quiet, now. Remember the seventh stair!\"  They crept up, one by one, each to his or her old room. There needed to be no \"doubling up,\" for the house was large, and each room had been left precisely as its owner had left it. It was rather ghostly, this stealing silently about with candles, and in the necessity for the suppression of speech the animation of the party rather suffered eclipse. It was late, and they were beginning to be sleepy, so they were soon in bed. But, somehow, once"]]]
