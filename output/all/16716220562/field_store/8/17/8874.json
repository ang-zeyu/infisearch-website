These show some striking resemblances to the red seaweeds, and possibly form a transition from the green algæ to the red. The commonest species form bright-green discs, adhering firmly to the stems and floating leaves of water lilies and other aquatics. In aquaria they sometimes attach themselves in large numbers to the glass sides of the vessel.    Growing from the upper surface are numerous hairs, consisting of a   short, sheath-like base, including a very long and delicate filament   (Fig. 17, _B_). In their methods of reproduction they resemble   _Œdogonium_, but the reproductive organs are more specialized.     CHAPTER V.  GREEN ALGÆ--_Continued_.   ORDER III.--POND SCUMS (_Conjugatæ_).  The _Conjugatæ_, while in some respects approaching the _Confervaceæ_ in structure, yet differ from them to such an extent in some respects that their close relationship is doubtful. They are very common and familiar plants, some of them forming great floating masses upon the surface of every stagnant pond and ditch, being commonly known as \"pond scum.\" The commonest of these pond scums belong to the genus _Spirogyra_, and one of these will illustrate the characteristics of the order. When in active growth these masses are of a vivid green, and owing to the presence of a gelatinous coating feel slimy, slipping through the hands when one attempts to lift them from the water. Spread out in water, the masses are seen to be composed of slender threads, often many centimetres in length, and showing no sign of branching.  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--_A_, a filament of a common pond scum (_Spirogyra_) separating into two parts. _B_, a cell undergoing division.

All × 150.]    For microscopical examination the larger species are preferable.   When one of these is magnified (Fig. 18, _A_, _C_), the unbranched   filament is shown to be made up of perfectly cylindrical cells, with   rather delicate walls. The protoplasm is confined to a thin layer   lining the walls, except for numerous fine filaments that radiate   from the centrally placed nucleus (_n_), which thus appears   suspended in the middle of the cell. The nucleus is large and   distinct in the larger species, and has a noticeably large and   conspicuous nucleolus. The most noticeable thing about the cell is   the green spiral bands running around it. These are the   chloroplasts, which in all the _Conjugatæ_ are of very peculiar   forms. The number of these bands varies much in different species of   _Spirogyra_, but is commonly two or three. These chloroplasts, like   those of other plants, are not noticeably different in structure   from the ordinary protoplasm, as is shown by extracting the   chlorophyll, which may be done by placing the plants in alcohol for   a short time. This extracts the chlorophyll, but a microscopic   examination of the decolored cells shows that the bands remain   unchanged, except for the absence of color. These bands are   flattened, with irregularly scalloped margins, and at intervals have   rounded bodies (pyrenoids) imbedded in them (Fig. 18, _C_, _py._).   The pyrenoids, especially when the plant has been exposed to the   light for some time, are surrounded by a circle of small granules,   which become bluish when iodine is applied, showing them to be   starch. (To show the effect of iodine on starch on a large scale,   mix a little flour, which is nearly all starch, with water, and add   a little iodine. The starch will immediately become colored blue,   varying in intensity with the amount of iodine.) The cells divide   much as in _Cladophora_, but the nucleus here takes part in the   process. The division naturally occurs only at night, but by   reducing the temperature at night to near the freezing point (4° C.,   or a little lower), the process may be checked. The experiment is   most conveniently made when the temperature out of doors approaches   the freezing point. Then it is only necessary to keep the plants in   a warm room until about 10 P.M., when they may be put out of doors   for the night. On bringing them in in the morning, the division will   begin almost at once, and may be easily studied. The nucleus divides   into two parts, which remain for a time connected by delicate   threads (Fig. 18, _B_), that finally disappear. At first no nucleoli   are present in the daughter nuclei, but they appear before the   division is complete.    New filaments are formed by the breaking up of the old ones, this   sometimes being very rapid. As the cells break apart, the free ends   bulge strongly, showing the pressure exerted upon the cell wall by   the contents (Fig. 18, _A_).  Spores like those of _Œdogonium_ are formed, but the process is somewhat different. It occurs in most species late in the spring, but may sometimes be met with at other times. The masses of fruiting plants usually appear brownish colored. If spores have been formed they can, in the larger species at least, be seen with a hand lens, appearing as rows of dark-colored specks.    Two filaments lying side by side send out protuberances of the cell   wall that grow toward each other until they touch (Fig. 18, _D_). At   the point of contact, the wall is absorbed, forming a continuous   channel from one cell to the other. This process usually takes place   in all the cells of the two filaments, so that the two filaments,   connected by tubes at regular intervals, have the form of a ladder.    In some species adjoining cells of the same filament become   connected, the tubes being formed at the end of the cells (Fig. 18,   _H_), and the cell in which the spore is formed enlarges.    Soon after the channel is completed, the contents of one cell flow   slowly through it into the neighboring cell, and the protoplasm of   the two fuses into one mass. (The union of the nuclei has also been   observed.) The young spore thus formed contracts somewhat, becoming   oval in form, and soon secretes a thick wall, colorless at first,   but afterwards becoming brown and more or less opaque. The   chlorophyll bands, although much crowded, are at first   distinguishable, but later lose the chlorophyll, and become   unrecognizable. Like the resting spores of _Œdogonium_ these require   a long period of rest before germinating.  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Forms of _Zygnemaceæ_. _A_, _Zygnema_. _B_, _C_, _D_, _Mesocarpus_. All × 150.]  There are various genera of the pond scums, differing in the form of the chloroplasts and also in the position of the spores. Of these may be mentioned _Zygnema_ (Fig. 19, _A_), with two star-shaped chloroplasts in each cell, and _Mesocarpus_ (Fig. 19, _B_, _D_), in which the single chloroplast has the form of a thin median plate. (B shows the appearance from in front, _C_ from the side, showing the thickness of the plate.) _Mesocarpus_ and the allied genera have the spore formed between the filaments, the contents of both the uniting cells leaving them.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Forms of Desmids. _A_, _B_, _Closterium_. _C_, _D_, _Dʹ_, _Cosmarium_. _D_, and _Dʹ_ show the process of division. _E_, _F_, _Staurastrum_; _E_ seen from the side, _F_ from the end.]  Evidently related to the pond scums, but differing in being for the most part strictly unicellular, are the desmids (Fig. 20). They are confined to fresh water, and seldom occur in masses of sufficient size to be seen with the naked eye, usually being found associated with pond scums or other filamentous forms. Many of the most beautiful forms may be obtained by examining the matter adhering to the leaves and stems of many floating water plants, especially the bladder weed (_Utricularia_) and other fine-leaved aquatics.    The desmids include the most beautiful examples of unicellular   plants to be met with, the cells having extremely elegant outlines.   The cell shows a division into two parts, and is often constricted   in the middle, each division having a single large chloroplast of   peculiar form. The central part of the cell in which the nucleus   lies is colorless.    Among the commonest forms, often growing with _Spirogyra_, are   various species of _Closterium_ (Fig. 20, _A_, _B_), recognizable at   once by their crescent shape. The cell appears bright green, except   at the ends and in the middle. The large chloroplast in each half is   composed of six longitudinal plates, united at the axis of the cell.   Several large pyrenoids are always found, often forming a regular   line through the central axis. At each end of the cell is a vacuole   containing small granules that show an active dancing movement.  The desmids often have the power of movement, swimming or creeping slowly over the slide as we examine them, but the mechanism of these movements is still doubtful.  In their reproduction they closely resemble the pond scums.   ORDER IV.--_Siphoneæ_.  The _Siphoneæ_ are algæ occurring both in fresh and salt water, and are distinguished from other algæ by having the form of a tube, undivided by partition walls, except when reproduction occurs. The only common representatives of the order in fresh water are those belonging to the genus _Vaucheria_, but these are to be had almost everywhere. They usually occur in shallow ditches and ponds, growing on the bottom, or not infrequently becoming free, and floating where the water is deeper. They form large, dark green, felted masses, and are sometimes known as \"green felts.\" Some species grow also on the wet ground about springs. An examination of one of the masses shows it to be made up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],["title","Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#7)"],["body"," closely matted, hair-like threads, each of which is an individual plant.    In transferring the plants to the slide for microscopic examination,   they must be handled very carefully, as they are very easily   injured. Each thread is a long tube, branching sometimes, but not   divided into cells as in _Spirogyra_ or _Cladophora_. If we follow   it to the tip, the contents here will be found to be denser, this   being the growing point. By careful focusing it is easy to show that   the protoplasm is confined to a thin layer lining the wall, the   central cavity of the tube being filled with cell sap. In the   protoplasm are numerous elongated chloroplasts (_cl._). and a larger   or smaller number of small, shining, globular bodies (_ol._). These   latter are drops of oil, and, when the filaments are injured,   sometimes run together, and form drops of large size. No nucleus can   be seen in the living plant, but by treatment with chromic acid and   staining, numerous very small nuclei may be demonstrated.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--_A_, _C_, successive stages in the development of the sexual organs of a green felt (_Vaucheria_). _an._ antheridium. _og._ oögonium. _D_, a ripe oögonium. _E_, the same after it has opened. _o_, the egg cell. _F_, a ripe spore. _G_, a species in which the sexual organs are borne separately on the main filament. _A_, _F_, × 150. _G_, × 50. _cl._ chloroplasts. _ol._ oil.]    When the filaments are growing upon the ground, or at the bottom of   shallow water, the lower end is colorless, and forms a more or less   branching root-like structure, fastening it to the earth. These   rootlets, like the rest of the filament, are undivided by walls.    One of the commonest and at the same time most characteristic   species is _Vaucheria racemosa_ (Fig. 21, _A_, _F_). The plant   multiplies non-sexually by branches pinched off by a constriction at   the point where they join the main filament, or by the filament   itself becoming constricted and separating into several parts, each   one constituting a new individual.    The sexual organs are formed on special branches, and their   arrangement is such as to make the species instantly recognizable.    The first sign of their development is the formation of a short   branch (Fig. 21, _A_) growing out at right angles to the main   filament. This branch becomes club-shaped, and the end somewhat   pointed and more slender, and curves over. This slender, curved   portion is almost colorless, and is soon shut off from the rest of   the branch. It is called an \"antheridium,\" and within are produced,   by internal division, numerous excessively small spermatozoids.    As the branch grows, its contents become very dense, the oil drops   especially increasing in number and size. About the time that the   antheridium becomes shut off, a circle of buds appears about its   base (Fig. 21, _B_, _og._). These are the young oögonia, which   rapidly increase in size, assuming an oval form, and become   separated by walls from the main branch (_C_). Unlike the   antheridium, the oögonia contain a great deal of chlorophyll,   appearing deep green.    When ripe, the antheridium opens at the end and discharges the   spermatozoids, which are, however, so very small as scarcely to be   visible except with the strongest lenses. They are little oval   bodies with two cilia, which may sometimes be rendered visible by   staining with iodine.  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--_A_, non-sexual reproduction in _Vaucheria sessilis_. _B_, non-sexual spore of _V. geminata_, × 50.]    The oögonia, which at first are uniformly colored, just before   maturity show a colorless space at the top, from which the   chloroplasts and oil drops have disappeared (_D_), and at the same   time this portion pushes out in the form of a short beak. Soon after   the wall is absorbed at this point, and a portion of the contents is   forced out, leaving an opening, and at the same time the remaining   contents contract to form a round mass, the germ or egg cell   (Fig. 21, _E_, _o_). Almost as soon as the oögonium opens, the   spermatozoids collect about it and enter; but, on account of their   minuteness, it is almost impossible to follow them into the egg   cell, or to determine whether several or only one enter. The   fertilized egg cell becomes almost at once surrounded by a wall,   which rapidly thickens, and forms a resting spore. As the spore   ripens, it loses its green color, becoming colorless, with a few   reddish brown specks scattered through it (_F_).    In some species the sexual organs are borne directly on the filament   (Fig. 21, _G_).    Large zoöspores are formed in some of the green felts (Fig. 22,   _A_), and are produced singly in the ends of branches that become   swollen, dark green, and filled with very dense protoplasm. This end   becomes separated by a wall from the rest of the branch, the end   opens, and the contents escape as a very large zoöspore, covered   with numerous short cilia (_A_ ii). After a short period of   activity, this loses its cilia, develops a wall, and begins to grow   (III, IV). Other species (_B_) produce similar spores, which,   however, are not motile, and remain within the mother cell until   they are set free by the decay of its wall.   ORDER V.--_Characeæ_.  The _Characeæ_, or stone-worts, as some of them are called, are so very different from the other green algæ that it is highly probable that they should be separated from them.  The type of the order is the genus _Chara_ (Fig. 23), called stone-worts from the coating of carbonate of lime found in most of them, giving them a harsh, stony texture. Several species are common growing upon the bottom of ponds and slow streams, and range in size from a few centimetres to a metre or more in height.  The plant (Fig. 23, _A_) consists of a central jointed axis with circles of leaves at each joint or node. The distance between the nodes (internodes) may in the larger species reach a length of several centimetres. The leaves are slender, cylindrical structures, and like the stem divided into nodes and internodes, and have at the nodes delicate leaflets.  At each joint of the leaf, in fruiting specimens, attached to the inner side, are borne two small, roundish bodies, in the commoner species of a reddish color (Fig. 23, _A_, _r_). The lower of the two is globular, and bright scarlet in color; the other, more oval and duller.  Examined with a lens the main axis presents a striated appearance. The whole plant is harsh to the touch and brittle, owing to the limy coating. It is fastened to the ground by fine, colorless hairs, or rootlets.  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--_A_, plant of a stone-wort (_Chara_), one-half natural size. _r_, reproductive organs. _B_, longitudinal section through the apex. _S_, apical cell. _x_, nodes. _y_, internodes. _C_, a young leaf. _D_, cross section of an internode. _E_, of a node of a somewhat older leaf. _F_, _G_, young sexual organs seen in optical section. _o_, oögonium. _An._ antheridium. _H_, superficial view. _G_, _I_, group of filaments containing spermatozoids. _J_, a small portion of one of these more magnified, showing a spermatozoid in each cell. _K_, free spermatozoids. _L_, a piece of a leaf with ripe oögonium (_o_), and antheridium (_An._). _B_, _H_, × 150. _J_, _K_, × 300. _I_, × 50. _L_, × 25.]    By making a series of longitudinal sections with a sharp razor   through the top of the plant, and magnifying sufficiently, it is   found to end in a single, nearly hemispherical cell (Fig. 23, _B_,   _S_). This from its position is called the \"apical cell,\" and from   it are derived all the tissues of the plant. Segments are cut off   from its base, and these divide again into two by a wall parallel to   the first. Of the two cells thus formed one undergoes no further   division and forms the central cell of an internode (_y_); the other   divides repeatedly, forming a node or joint (_x_).    As the arrangement of these cells is essentially the same in the   leaves and stem, we will examine it in the former, as by cutting   several cross-sections of the whole bunch of young leaves near the   top of the plant, we shall pretty certainly get some sections   through a joint. The arrangement is shown in Figure 23, _E_.    As the stem grows, a covering is formed over the large internodal   cell (_y_) by the growth of cells from the nodes. These grow both   from above and below, meeting in the middle of the internode and   completely hiding the long axial cell. A section across the   internode shows the large axial cell (_y_) surrounded by the   regularly arranged cells of the covering or cortex (Fig. 23, _D_).    All the cells contain a layer of protoplasm next the wall with   numerous oval chloroplasts. If the cells are uninjured, they often   show a very marked movement of the protoplasm. These movements are   best seen, however, in forms like _Nitella_, where the long   internodal cells are not covered with a cortex. In _Chara_ they are   most evident in the root hairs that fasten the plant to the ground.    The growth of the leaves is almost identical with that of the stem,   but the apical growth is limited, and the apical cell becomes   finally very long and pointed (Fig. 23, _C_). In some species the   chloroplasts are reddish in the young cells, assuming their green   color as the cells approach maturity.  The plant multiplies non-sexually by means of special branches that may become detached, but there are no non-sexual spores formed.    The sexual organs have already been noticed arising in pairs at the   joints of the leaves. The oögonium is formed above, the antheridium   below.    The young oögonium (_F_, _O_) consists of a central cell, below   which is a smaller one surrounded by a circle of five others, which   do not at first project above the central cell, but later completely   envelop it (_G_). Each of these five cells early becomes divided   into an upper and"]]]
