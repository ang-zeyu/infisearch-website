That it included            comment on the meaning that lay back of the words may be            gravely doubted. The average hula dancer of modern times            shows great ignorance of the mele he recites, and this is            true even of the kumu-hula. His work too often is largely            perfunctory, a matter of sound and form, without appeal to            the intellect.             It would not be legitimate, however, to conclude from this            that ignorance of the meaning was the rule in old times;            those were the days when the nation’s traditional songs,            myths, and lore formed the equipment of every alert and            receptive mind, chief or commoner. There was no printed page            to while away the hours of idleness. The library was stored            in one’s memory. The language of the mele, which now has [Page 29]  become antiquated, then was familiar speech. For a kumu-hula            to have given instruction in the meaning of a song would have            been a superfluity, as if one at the present day were to            inform a group of well-educated actors and actresses who was            Pompey or Julius Cæsar.             “Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,            trippingly on the tongue.” Hamlet’s words to the players            were, it may be supposed, the substance of the kumu’s            instructions to the pupils in his halau.             The organization of a hula company was largely democratic.            The kumu—in modern sense, the teacher—was the leader and            conductor, responsible for the training and discipline of the            company. He was the business manager of the enterprise; the            priest, _kahuna_, the leader in the religious exercises, the            one who interpreted the will of heaven, especially of the            gods whose favor determined success. He might be called to            his position by the choice of the company, appointed by the            command of the alii who promoted the enterprise, or            self-elected in case the enterprise was his own. He had under            him a _kokua kumu_, a deputy, who took charge during his            absence.             The _po’o-puaa_ was an officer chosen by the pupils to be            their special agent and mouthpiece. He saw to the execution            of the kumu’s judgments and commands, collected the fines,            and exacted the penalties imposed by the kumu. It fell to him            to convey to the altar the presents of garlands, awa, and the            like that were contributed to the halau.             The _paepae_, also chosen by the pupils, subject to            confirmation by the kumu, acted as an assistant of the            po’o-puaa. During the construction of the kuahu the po’o-puaa            stood to the right, the paepae at his left. They were in a            general sense guardians of the kuahu.             The _ho’o-ulu_ was the guard stationed at the door. He            sprinkled with sea-water mixed with turmeric everyone who            entered the halau. He also acted as sergeant-at-arms to keep            order and remove anyone who made a disturbance. It was his            duty each day to place a fresh bowl of awa on the altar of            the goddess (_hanai kuahu_), literally to feed the altar.             In addition to these officials, a hula company naturally            required the services of a miscellaneous retinue of stewards,            cooks, fishermen, hewers of wood, and drawers of water.                              RULES OF CONDUCT AND TABUS             Without a body of rules, a strict penal code, and a firm hand            to hold in check the hot bloods of both sexes, it would have            been impossible to keep order and to accomplish the business            purpose of the organization. The explosive force of passion            would have made the gathering a signal for the breaking loose            of pandemonium. That it did not always so result is a [Page 30]   compliment alike to the self-restraint of the people and to            the sway that artistic ideals held over their minds, but,            above all, to a peculiar system of discipline wisely adapted            to the necessities of human nature. It does not seem likely            that a Thespian band of our own race would have held their            passions under equal check if surrounded by the same            temptations and given the same opportunities as these            Polynesians. It may well be doubted if the bare authority of            the kumu would have sufficed to maintain discipline and to            keep order, had it not been reenforced by the dread powers of            the spirit world in the shape of the _tabu_.             The awful grasp of this law; this repressive force, the tabu,            held fast the student from the moment of his entrance into            the halau. It denied this pleasure, shut off that innocent            indulgence, curtailed liberty in this direction and in that.            The tabu waved before his imagination like a flaming sword,            barring approach to the Eden of his strongest propensity.             The rules and discipline of the halau, the school for the            hula, from our point of view, were a mixture of shrewd common            sense and whimsical superstition. Under the head of tabus            certain articles of food were denied; for instance, the            sugar-cane—_ko_—was forbidden. The reason assigned was that            if one indulged in it his work as a practitioner would amount            to nothing; in the language of the kumu, _aohe e leo ana kana            mau hana_, his work will be a failure. The argument turned on            the double meaning of the word _ko_, the first meaning being            sugar cane, the second, accomplishment. The Hawaiians were            much impressed by such whimsical nominalisms. Yet there is a            backing of good sense to the rule. Anyone who has chewed the            sweet stalk can testify that for some time thereafter his            voice is rough, ill-fitted for singing or elocution.             The strictest propriety and decorum were exacted of the            pupils; there must be no license whatever. Even married            people during the weeks preceding graduation must observe            abstinence toward their partners. The whole power of one’s            being must be devoted to the pursuit of art.             The rules demanded also the most punctilious personal            cleanliness. Above all things, one must avoid contact with a            corpse. Such defilement barred one from entrance to the halau            until ceremonial cleansing had been performed. The offender            must bathe in the ocean; the kumu then aspersed him with holy            water, uttered a prayer, ordered a penalty, an offering to            the kuahu, and declared the offender clean. This done, he            was again received into fellowship at the halau.             The ordinary penalty for a breach of ceremony or an offense            against sexual morality was the offering of a baked porkling            with awa. Since the introduction of money the penalty has            generally been reckoned on a commercial basis; a money fine            is imposed. The offering of pork and awa is retained as a            concession to tradition.  [Page 31]                      V—CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION; DÉBUT OF A HULA DANCER                                  CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION             The _ai-lolo_ rite and ceremony marked the consummation of a            pupil’s readiness for graduation from the school of the halau            and his formal entrance into the guild of hula dancers. As            the time drew near, the kumu tightened the reins of            discipline, and for a few days before that event no pupil            might leave the halau save for the most stringent necessity,            and then only with the head muffled (_pulo’u_) to avoid            recognition, and he might engage in no conversation whatever            outside the halau.             The night preceding the day of ai-lolo was devoted to special            services of dance and song. Some time after midnight the            whole company went forth to plunge into the ocean, thus to            purge themselves of any lurking ceremonial impurity. The            progress to the ocean and the return they made in complete            nudity. “Nakedness is the garb of the gods.” On their way to            and from the bath they must not look back, they must not turn            to the right hand or to the left.             The kumu, as the priest, remained at the halau, and as the            procession returned from the ocean he met it at the door and            sprinkled each one (_pikai_) with holy water. Then came            another period of dance and song; and then, having            cantillated a _pule hoonoa_, to lift the tabu, the kumu went            forth to his own ceremonial cleansing bath in the sea. During            his absence his deputy, the _kokua kumu_, took charge of the            halau. When the kumu reached the door on his return, he made            himself known by reciting a _mele wehe puka_, the            conventional password.             Still another exercise of song and dance, and the wearied            pupils are glad to seek repose. Some will not even remove the            short dancing skirts that are girded about them, so eager            are they to snatch an hour of rest; and some lie down with            bracelets and anklets yet unclasped.             At daybreak the kumu rouses the company with the tap of the            drum. After ablutions, before partaking of their simple            breakfast, the company stand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20299"],["title","Unwritten Literature of Hawaii: The Sacred Songs of the Hula (#8)"],["body","the altar and recite a            tabu-removing prayer, accompanying the cantillation with a            rhythmic tapping of feet and clapping of hands:                      _Pule Hoonoa_                  Pupu we’uwe’u e, Laka e!

Hers are the growths that stand here.                 Suppliants we to Laka.                 The prayer to Laka has power;             5   The maile of Laka stands to the fore.                 The maile vine casts now its seeds.                 Freedom, there’s freedom to me, Kahaula—                 A freedom twofold.            10   Freedom, aye freedom!                 A tabu profound, a freedom complete.                 Ye gods are still tabu;                 We mortals are free.             [Footnote 32: _Lu ka hua_. Casts now its seeds. The maile vine            (pl. IV), one of the goddess’s emblems, casts its seeds,            meaning that the goddess gives the pupils skill and inspires            them.]             At the much-needed repast to which the company now sit down            there may be present a gathering of friends and relatives and            of hula experts, called _olóhe_. Soon the porkling chosen to            be the _ai-lólo_ offering is brought in—a black suckling            without spot or blemish. The kumu holds it down while all the            pupils gather and lay their hands upon his hands; and he            expounds to them the significance of the ceremony. If they            consecrate themselves to the work in hand in sincerity and            with true hearts, memory will be strong and the training, the            knowledge, and the songs that have been intrusted to the            memory will stay. If they are heedless, regardless of their            vows, the songs they have learned will fly away.             The ceremony is long and impressive; many songs are used.            Sometimes, it was claimed, the prayers of the kumu at this            laying on of hands availed to cause the death of the little            animal. On the completion of the ceremony the offering is            taken out and made ready for the oven.             One of the first duties of the day is the dismantling of the            old kuahu, the shrine, and the construction of another from            new materials as a residence for the goddess. While night yet            shadows the earth the attendants and friends of the pupils [Page 33]  have gone up into the mountains to collect the material for            the new shrine. The rustic artists, while engaged in this            loving work of building and weaving the new kuahu, cheer and            inspire one another with joyful songs vociferous with the            praise of Laka. The halau also they decorate afresh, strewing            the floor with clean rushes, until the whole place enthralls            the senses like a bright and fragrant temple.  [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY BULLETIN 38 PLATE IV MAILE (ALYXIA MYRTILLIFOLIA) WREATH]             The kumu now grants special dispensation to the pupils to go            forth that they may make good the results of the neglect of            the person incident to long confinement in the halau. For            days, for weeks, perhaps for months, they have not had full            opportunity to trim hair, nails, or beard, to anoint and            groom themselves. They use this short absence from the hall            also to supply themselves with wreaths of fragrant maile,            crocus-yellow ilima, scarlet-flaming lehua, fern, and what            not.             At the appointed hour the pupils, wreathed and attired like            nymphs and dryads, assemble in the halau, sweet with woodsy            perfumes. At the door they receive aspersion with consecrated            water.             The ai-lolo offering, cooked to a turn—no part raw, no part            cracked or scorched—is brought in from the _imu_, its bearer            sprinkled by the guard at the entrance. The kumu, having            inspected the roast offering and having declared it            ceremonially perfect, gives the signal, and the company break            forth in songs of joy and of adulation to goddess Laka:                          _Mele Kuau_                  Noho ana Laka I ka ulu wehi-wehi,                 Ku ana iluna i Mo’o-helaia,[33]                 Ohia-Ku[34] ouna o Mauna-loa.[35]                 Aloha mai Kaulana-ula[36] ia’u.             5   Eia ka ula la, he ula leo,[37]                 He uku, he modai, he kanaenae,                 He alana na’u ia oe.                 E Laka e, e maliu mai;                 E maliu mai oe, i pono au,            10   A pono au, a pono kaua.             [Footnote 33: _Mo’o-helaia_. A female deity, a _kupua_, who at            death became one of the divinities, _au-makua_, of the hula.            Her name was conferred on the place claimed as her residence,            on Mauna-loa, island of Molokai.]             [Footnote 34: _Ohia-Ku_.

A singing or trilling sound, a            _tinnitus aurium_, a sign that the deity Kaulanaula was            making some communication to the one who heard it.                  “By the pricking of my thumbs                 Something wicked this way comes.”]  [Page 34]                             [Translation.]                           _Altar-Prayer_                  Laka sits in her shady grove,                 Stands on her terrace, at Mo’o-helaia;                 Like the tree of God Ku on Mauna-loa.                 Kaulana-ula trills in my ear;             5   A whispered suggestion to me,                 Lo, an offering, a payment,                 A eulogy give I to thee.                 O Laka, incline to me!                 Have compassion, let it be well—            10   Well with me, well with us both.             There is no stint of prayer-song. While the offering rests on            the kuahu, the joyful service continues:                    _Mele Kuahu_                  E Laka, e!                 Pupu we’uwe’u e, Laka e!                 E Laka i ka leo;                 E laka i ka loaa;             5   E Laka i ka waiwai;                 E Laka i na mea a pau!                       [Translation.]                    _Altar-Prayer_                  O goddess Laka!                 O wildwood bouquet, O Laka!                 O Laka, queen of the voice!                 O Laka, giver of gifts!             5   O Laka, giver of bounty!                 O Laka, giver of all things!             At the conclusion of this loving service of worship and song            each member of the troupe removes from his head and neck the            wreaths that had bedecked him, and with them crowns the            image of the goddess until her altar is heaped with the            offerings.             Now comes the pith of the ceremony: the novitiates sit down            to the feast of ai-lolo, theirs the place of honor, at the            head of the table, next the kuahu. The _ho’o-pa’a_, acting            as carver, selects the typical parts—snout, ear-tips, tail,            feet, portions of the vital organs, especially the brain            (_lolo_). This last it is which gives name to the ceremony.            He sets an equal portion before each novitiate. Each one must            eat all that is set before him. It is a mystical rite, a            sacrament; as he eats he consciously partakes of the virtue            of the goddess that is transmitted to himself. [Page 35]            Meantime the _olohe_ and friends of the novitiates, inspired            with the proper enthusiasm, of the occasion, lift their            voices in joyful cantillations in honor of the goddess,            accompanied with the clapping of hands.             The ceremony now reaches a new stage. The kumu lifts the tabu            by uttering a prayer—always a song—and declares the place            and the feast free, and the whole assembly sit down to enjoy            the bounty that is spread up and down the halau. On this            occasion men and women may eat in common. The only articles            excluded from this feast are _luau_—a food much like            spinach, made by cooking the young and delicate taro            leaf—and the drupe of the _hala_, the pandanus (pl. xviii).             The company sit down to eat and to drink; presently they rise            to dance and sing. The kumu leads in a tabu-lifting,            freedom-giving song and the ceremony of ai-lolo is over. The            pupils have been graduated from the school of the halau; they            are now members of the great guild of hula dancers. The time            has come for them to make their bow to the waiting public        "]]]
