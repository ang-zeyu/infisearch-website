Centuries come and go; but the plot of the drama is unchanged, and the same characters play the same parts.  Only the actors cast for them are new.   It is much worn,--this denarius,--and the lines are softened and blurred,--as of right they should be, when you think that more than two thousand years have passed since it felt the die.  It is lying before me now on my table, and my eyes rest dreamily on its helmeted head of Pallas Nicephora.  There, behind her, is the mint-mark and that word of ancient power and glory, \"Roma.\"  Below are letters so worn and indistinct that I must bend close to read them: \"--M. SERGI,\" and then others that I cannot trace.  Perhaps I have dozed a bit, for I must have turned the coin, unthinking, and now I see the reverse: a horseman, in full panoply, galloping, with naked sword brandished in his left hand, from which depends a severed head tight-clutched by long, flowing hair.  The clouds hang low over the city, as I peer from my tower window,--driving, ever driving, from the east, and changing, ever changing, their fantastic shapes.  Now they are the waving hands and gowns of a closely packed multitude surging with human passions; now they are the headlong rout of a flying army upon which press hordes of riders, dark, fierce, and barbarous--horses with tumultuous manes, and hands with brandished darts.  Surely it is a sleepy, workless day!  It will be vain to drive my pen across the pages.  I do not see the cloud forms now--not with my eyes, for they have closed themselves perforce; but my brain is awake, and I know that the eyes of Pallas Nicephora see them, and grow brighter as if gazing on well-remembered scenes.  Why not?  How many thousand clinkings of coin against coin in purse and pouch, how many hundred impacts of hands that long since are dust, have served to dim your once clear relief!  Surely, Pallas, you have looked upon all this and much more.  Shall I see aught with your eyes, lady of my Sergian denarius?  Shall I see, if, with you before me, I look fixedly at the legions of clouds that cross my window an hour--two--three--even until the night closes in?  Grant but a grain of this, O Goddess, and lo! I vow to thee a troop of pipe-players upon the Ides of June.     I.  NEWS.  \"A troop of pipe-players to Minerva on the Ides of June, if we win!\"  \"And my household to Mars, if we have lost!\"  The speakers were hurrying along the street that leads down from the Palatine Hill toward the Forum, and both were young.  Their high shoes fastened with quadruple thongs and adorned with small silver crescents proclaimed their patrician rank.  \"Why do you vow as if the gods had already passed judgment, Lucius?\"  \"Because, my Caius, I am very sure that a battle has been fought.  What else do these rumours mean that are flying through the city? rumours that none can trace to a source.  It is only a few minutes, since my freedman, Atius, told me how the slaves report that our neighbour Marcus Sabrius rode in last night through the Ratumenian Gate; and when I sent to his house to inquire, the doorkeeper feigned ignorance.  That is only one of a hundred tales.  Note the crowd thickening around us as we approach the Forum, and how all are pressing in the same direction. Study their faces, and doubt what I say if you can.\"  \"But is it victory or defeat?\"  \"Answer me your own question, Caius.  Is 'victory' or 'defeat' the word that men do not dare to utter?\"  The face of Caius became grave.  Then suddenly he burst out with:--  \"You are right.  I see it all now, even as you speak; and what hope had we from the first?  Who was the demagogue Flaminius that he should command our army, going forth without the auspices--a consul that was no consul at all in the sight of the gods!  Then, too, there were the warnings that poured in from all the country: the ships in the sky, the crow alighting on the couch in the Temple of Juno, the stones rained in Picinum--\"  \"Foolish stories, my Caius; the dreams of ignorant rustics,\" replied Lucius, smiling faintly.  \"Besides, you remember they were all expiated--\"  \"And who knows that they were expiated truly!\" croaked an old woman from a booth by the road.  \"Who does not know that, as Varro says, your patrician magistrates would rather lose a battle than that a plebeian consul should triumph!  Varbo, the butcher, dreamed last night that his son's blood was drenching his bed, and when he awoke, it was water from the roof; and Arates, the Greek soothsayer, says that Varbo's son has been slain in the water, and his blood--\"  But the young patricians, who had halted a moment at the interruption, now hurried on with an expression of contempt on their faces.  \"That is what Flaminius stands for,\" resumed Lucius after a moment of silence.  \"How can we look for success when such men are raised to the command, merely because they _are_ such men; and when a Fabius and a Claudius are set aside because their fathers' fathers led the armies of the Republic to victory in the days when this rabble were the slaves they should still be.\"  The friends had turned into the Sacred Way.  A moment later they arrived at the Forum lined with its rows of booths nestled away beneath massive porticoes of peperino, and with its columned temples standing like divine sentinels about or sweeping away up the rugged slope of the Capitoline to where the great fane of Jupiter Capitolinus shed its protecting glory over the destinies of Rome.  Below, the broad expanse of Forum and Comitia was thronged with a surging crowd--patricians and plebeians,--elbowing and pushing one another in mad efforts to get closer to the Rostra and to a small group of magistrates, who, with grave faces, were clustered at the foot of its steps.  These latter spoke to each other in whispers, but such a babel of sounds swelled up around them that they might safely have screamed without fear of being overheard.  The booths were emptied of their cooks and butchers and silversmiths. Waving arms and the flutter of robes emphasized the discussions going on on every side.  Here a rumour-monger was telling his tale to a gaping cluster of pallid faces; there a plebeian pot-house orator was arraigning the upper classes to a circle of lowering brows and clenched fists, while the sneering face of some passing patrician told of a disdain beyond words, as he gathered his toga closer to avoid the contamination of the rabble.  One sentiment, however, seemed to prevail over all, and, beside it, curiosity, party rancour, wrath, and contempt were as nothing.  It was anxiety sharpened even into dread that brooded everywhere and controlled all other passions, while itself threatening at every moment to sweep away the barriers and to loose the warm southern blood of the citizens into a seething flood of furious riot or headlong panic.  The two young men had descended into this maelstrom of popular excitement, and were making such headway as they could toward the central point of interest.  Now and again they passed friends who either looked straight into their faces, without a sign of recognition, or else burst out into floods of information,--prayers for news or vouchsafings of it,--news, good or bad, true or false.  Perhaps three-fourths of the distance had been covered at the expense of torn togas and bruised sides, when a sudden commotion in front showed that something was happening.  The next moment the hard, stern face of Marcus Pomponius Matho, the praetor peregrinus, rose above the crowd, and then the broad purple band upon his toga, as he mounted the steps of the Rostra.  It seemed hours--almost days--that he stood there, grave and silent, looking down into the sea of upturned faces, while the roar of the multitude died away into a gentle murmur, and then into a silence so oppressive that each man seemed to be holding his breath.  Once the magistrate's lips moved, but no words came from them, and strange noises, as of the clenching of teeth and sharp, quick breathing, rose all about.  Then a voice came from his mouth, the very calmness of which seemed terrible:--  \"Quirites, we have been beaten in a great battle.  Our army is destroyed, and Caius Flaminius, the consul, is killed.\"  For a moment there was stillness deeper almost than before, as if the leadlike words were sinking slowly but steadily along passage and nerve down to the central seats of consciousness; then burst forth a sound as of a single groan--the groan of Jupiter himself in mortal anguish; and then the noise of women weeping, the shrieking treble of age, and the rumbling murmur of curses and execrations,--against senate"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20219"],["title","The Lion's Brood (#1)"],["body","nobles, against the rabble and their dead leader, but, above all, against Carthage and her terrible captain.  \"Who are these men that slay consuls and destroy armies?\" piped the shrill voice of an aged cripple who had struggled up from where he sat upon the steps of Castor, and was shaking the stump of a wrist toward the north.  \"Are they not the men who surrendered Sicily that we might let them escape from us at Eryx?  Did they not give up their ships, and pay us tribute, and scurry out of Sardinia that Rome might spare them?  I--I who am talking to you have seen their armies: naked barbarians from the deserts, naked barbarians from the woods--not one well-armed man in five--a rabble with a score of languages, to whom no general can talk. _They_ to destroy the army of Rome--in her own land!--what crime have we committed that the gods should deal with us thus?\"  \"But the great beasts that tear up the ranks?\" put in a young butcher, one of the circle that had been drawn together about the veteran.  \"How did his elephants save Pyrrhus--and then we saw them for the first time?\" retorted the cripple.  \"You forget, that was before Rome had become the prey of demagogues; before she had Flaminii for consuls.\"  All turned toward the new speaker--the young patrician whom his companion had called Lucius.  He was a man perhaps twenty-five years of age, of middle height, sparely built but as if of tempered steel, with strong, commanding features and dark hawklike eyes that were now glittering with passion.  It was not a handsome face except so far as strength and pride make masculine beauty, but it was the face of one whom a man might trust and a woman love.  The butcher was on the point of returning an angry retort, half to hide his awe of the other's rank, when a friend caught him by the arm.  \"Do you not see it is Lucius Sergius Fidenas?\" he whispered.  The result of the warning was still doubtful, when a sudden commotion in the crowd about them drew the attention of all to a short, thick-set man of middle age, in the light panoply of a mounted legionary.  Cries went up from all about:--  \"It is Marcus Decius.\"  \"He is from the army.\"  \"Tell us! what news?\"  For answer the newcomer turned from one to the other of his questioners, with a dazed expression on his pale, drawn face.  \"What shall I say, neighbours?\" he muttered at last.  \"My horse fell just out there on the Flaminian road, and I came here on foot.  I have eaten nothing for a day.\"  But they paid no attention to his wants, thronging around with almost threatening gestures and crying:--  \"What news?  What news--not of yourself--of the army?--of the battle?\"  \"There was no battle, and there is no army,\" said the man, dully.  Sergius forced his way to the front and threw one arm about the soldier.  Then, turning to the crowd:--  \"Stand back!\" he cried, \"and give him air.  Do you not see the fellow is fainting?\"  \"No battle--and yet no army,\" repeated Decius, in a murmurous monotone, when, for a moment, there were silence and space around him.  \"We marched by the Lake Trasimenus, and the fog lay thick upon us.  Then came a noise of shouts and clash of arms and shrieks, but we saw nothing--only sometimes a great, white, naked body swinging a huge sword, and again a black man buried in his horse's mane that waved about him as he rushed by--only these things and our own men falling--falling without ever a chance to strike or to see whence we were stricken.\"  The crowd shuddered.  \"And the elephants?\"  \"I did not see them.  They say they are all dead.\"  \"And the consul?\"  \"I do not know.\"  Just then the cripple from the steps was pushed forward.  \"Flaminius is dead.  He died fighting, as a Roman consul should.  But you?  What are you, to let the pulse-eaters at him.  You should have seen how _we_ dealt with them off the Aegusian Islands.\"  \"Or at Drepana?\" sneered the horseman, roused from his lethargy by the other's taunt.  \"That was what a _patrician_ consul brought us to,\" muttered the cripple, glancing at Sergius.  \"Do you know what the Claudian did? When the sacred chickens would not eat, he cried out, 'Then they shall drink,' and ordered them thrown overboard.  How could soldiers win when an impious commander had first challenged the gods?\"  \"And what about Flaminius ordering our standards to be dug up when they could not be drawn from the earth?\" retorted the other.  \"Did he do that?\" asked several, and for a moment the feeling that had been with the cripple, and against the victim of this latest disaster, seemed divided.  Sergius perceived only too clearly that, in the present temper of men's minds, the faintest spark could light fires of riot and murder that might leave but a heap of ashes and corpses for the Carthaginian to gain.  Taking advantage of the momentary lull, he said in conciliatory tones:--  \"Flaminius neglected the auspices, and disaster came upon us for his impiety, but it appears that he died like a brave soldier, and he is a whip-knave who strikes at such.  As for this man, he needs succour and care.  Stand aside, then, that I may take him where his wants may be ministered to.  There will soon be plenty of fugitives to fill your ears with tales.\"  \"Not many, master, not many,\" murmured Decius, as the young man forced a way for them through the crowd.  \"Some are taken, but most lie in the defile of Trasimenus or under the waters of the Lake.\"  Sergius hurried on, thinking of Varbo the butcher's dream, and of Arates the Greek soothsayer's interpretation.     II.  WORDS.  Three days had passed since the awful news from the shore of Lake Trasimenus had plunged Rome into horror and despair.  Every hour had brought in stragglers: horse, foot, fugitives from the country-side, each bearing his tale of slaughter.  Crowds gathered at the gates, swarming about every newcomer, vociferous for his story, and then cursing and threatening the teller because it was what they knew it must be.  In the atrium of Titus Manlius Torquatus, on the brow of the Palatine, overlooking the New Way, was gathered a company of three: the aged master of the house, a type of the Roman of better days, and a worthy descendant of that Torquatus who had won the name; his son Caius, the youth who had been with Sergius in the Forum; and Lucius Sergius himself.  All were silent and serious.  The elder Torquatus sat by a square fountain ornamented with bronze dolphins, that lay in the middle of the mosaic paving of the apartment. The walls were painted half yellow, half red, after the manner of Magna Grascia, while around them were ranged the statues of the Manlian nobles.  The roof was supported in the Tuscan fashion by four beams crossing each other at right angles, and including between them the open space above the fountain.  It was the old man who spoke first.  \"Do not think, my Lucius, but that I see the justice of your prayer, or that I wish otherwise than that Marcia should wind wool about your doorposts.  Still there is much to be said for delay.  Surely these days are not auspicious ones for marriages, and surely better will come.  You have my pledge, as had my dead friend Marcus Marcius in the matter of her name.  Do you think it was nothing for me to call a daughter other than Manlia--and for a plebeian house at that?  Yet she is Marcia.  Doubt not that I will keep this word as well.\"  \"Aye, but, father,\" persisted Sergius, \"is it not something that she should be mine to protect in time of peril?\"  \"And who so able to protect as Lucius,\" put in Caius, with an admiring glance, for Caius Torquatus was six years younger than his friend, and admired him with all the devotion of a younger man.  \"Has it come that our house cannot protect its women?\" cried the elder Torquatus.  \"What more shameful than that our daughter should be carried thus across a Sergian threshold--going like a slave to her master!\"  He spoke proudly and sternly.  Then, turning to Sergius, he went on more gently: \"Were you to remain in the city, my son, there might be more force in what you claim; but you will go out with one of the new legions that they will doubtless raise, and you will believe an old man who says that it is not well for a soldier in the field to have a young wife at home.\"  Sergius flushed and was silent, lest his answer should savour of pride or disrespect toward an elder.  Suddenly they became conscious of a commotion in the street.  Shrill cries were borne to their ears, and, a moment later, blows fell upon the outer door, followed by the grinding noise as it turned upon its pivots.  A freedman burst into the atrium.  Titus Torquatus rose from his seat, and half raised his staff as if to punish the unceremonious intrusion.  Then he noted the excitement under which the man seemed to be labouring, and stood stern and silent to learn what news could warrant such a breach of decorum.  \"It is Maharbal, they say--\" and the speaker's voice came almost in gasps--\"Maharbal and the Numidians--\"  \"Not at the gates!\" cried both young men, springing to their feet; but the other shook his head and went on:--  \"No, not that--not _yet_, but he has cut up four thousand cavalry in Umbria with Caius Centenius.  The consul had sent them from Gaul--\"  \"Be silent!\" commanded the elder Torquatus.  \"Surely I hear the public crier in the street.  Is he not summoning the Senate?  Velo,\" he said, turning to the freedman; \"you are pardoned for your intrusion.  Go, now, and bear orders from me to arm my household, and that my clients and freedmen wait upon me in the morning.  It is possible that the Republic may call for every man; and though I fear Titus Manlius Torquatus cannot strike the blows he struck in Sicily, yet even _his_ sword might avail to pierce light armour; and he is happy in that he can give those to the State whose muscles shall suffice to drive the point through heavy buckler and breastplate.\"  \"Shall it be permitted that I attend you to the Senate House?\" asked Caius.  His father inclined "]]]
