The question of the guilt or innocence of each individual was a matter of no importance. Hostages were taken and not for the alleged wrongs of others.  Did not General von Bülow on August 22nd announce to the inhabitants of Liège that       \"_it is with my consent that the General in command has burned down      the place [Andenne] and shot about 100 inhabitants._\"  It was the same chivalrous and humane General who posted a proclamation at Namur on August 25th as follows:       \"Before 4 o'clock all Belgian and French soldiers are to be      delivered up as prisoners of war. Citizens who do not obey this      will be condemned to hard labor for life in Germany. At 4 o'clock a      rigorous inspection of all houses will be made. _Every soldier      found will be shot._ * * * _The streets will be held by German      guards, who will hold ten hostages for each street. These hostages      will be shot if there is any trouble in that street._ * * * A crime      against the German Army will compromise the existence of the whole      town of Namur _and every one in it_.\"  Did not Field Marshal von der Goltz issue a proclamation in Brussels, on October 5th, stating that, if any individual disturbed the telegraphic or railway communications, all the inhabitants would be \"_punished without pity, the innocent suffering with the guilty_\"?  Individual guilt being thus a matter of minor importance, Dr. Zimmermann had no occasion on the accepted theory of Prussian militarism to justify the secret trial and midnight execution of Edith Cavell. Indeed, he freely intimates that his Government will not spare women, no matter how high and noble the motive may have been which inspires any infraction of military law, and to this sweeping statement he makes but one exception, namely, that women \"in a delicate condition may not be executed.\" But why the exception? If it be permitted to destroy one life for the welfare of the military administration of Belgium, why stop at two? If the innocent living are to be sacrificed, why spare the unborn? The exception itself shows that the rigor of military law must have some limitation, and that its iron rigor must be softened by a discretion dictated by such considerations of chivalry and magnanimity as have hitherto been observed by all civilized nations. If the victim of yesterday had been an \"expectant mother,\" Dr. Zimmermann suggests that her judges and executioners would have spared her, but no such exception can be found in the Prussian military code. \"It is not so nominated in the bond,\" and the Under Secretary's recognition of one exception, based upon considerations of humanity and not the letter of the military code, destroys the whole fabric of his case, _for it clearly shows that there was a power of discretion which von Bissing could have exercised, if he had so elected_.  That her case had its claims not only to magnanimity, but even to military justice, is shown by the haste with which, in the teeth of every protest, the unfortunate woman was hurried to her end. Sentenced at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she was executed nine hours later. Of what was General Baron von Bissing afraid? She was in his custody. Her power to help her country--save by dying--was forever at an end. The hot haste of her execution and the duplicity and secrecy which attended it betray an unmistakable fear that if her life had been spared until the world could have known of her death sentence, public opinion would have prevented this cruel and cowardly deed. The labored apology of Dr. Zimmermann and the swift action of the Kaiser in pardoning those who were condemned with Miss Cavell indicate that the Prussian officials have heard the beating of the wings of those avenging angels of history who, like the Eumenides of classic mythology, are the avengers of the innocent and the oppressed.  \"_Greatness_,\" wrote Aeschylus, \"_is no defense from utter destruction when a man insolently spurns the mighty altar of justice_.\"  This is as true to-day as when it was written more than two thousand years ago. It is but a classic echo of the old Hebraic moral axiom that \"the Lord God of recompenses shall surely requite.\"  The most powerful and self-willed ruler of modern times learned this lesson to his cost. Probably no two instances contributed so powerfully to the ultimate downfall of Napoleon as his ruthless assassination under the forms of military law of the Duke d'Enghien and the equally brutal murder of the German bookseller, Palm. The one aroused the undying enmity of Russia, and the blood that was shed in the moat of Vincennes was washed out in the icy waters of the Beresina. The fate of the poor German bookseller, whom Napoleon caused to be shot because his writing menaced the security of French occupation, developed as no other event the dormant spirit of German nationality, and the Nuremberg bookseller, shot precisely as was Miss Cavell, was finally avenged when Blücher gave Napoleon the _coup de grâce_ at Waterloo. No one more clearly felt the invisible presence of his Nemesis than did Napoleon. All his life, and even in his confinement at St. Helena, he was ceaselessly attempting to justify to the moral conscience of the world his ruthless assassination of the last Prince of the house of Condé. The terrible judgment of history was never better expressed than by Lamartine in the following language:       \"A cold curiosity carries the visitor to the battlefields of      Marengo, Austerlitz, Wagram, Leipsic, Waterloo; he wanders over      them with dry eyes, but one is shown at a corner of the wall near      the foundations of Vincennes, at the bottom of a ditch, a spot      covered with nettles and weeds. He says, 'There it is!' He utters a      cry and carries away with him undying pity for the victim and an      implacable resentment against the assassin. This resentment is      vengeance for the past and a lesson for the future. _Let the      ambitious, whether soldiers, tribunes, or kings, remember that if      they have hirelings to do their will, and flatterers to excuse      them while they reign, there yet comes afterward a human conscience      to judge them and pity to hate them. The murderer has but one hour;      the victim has eternity._\"  At the outbreak of the war Miss Cavell was living with her aged mother in England. Constrained by a noble and imperious sense of duty, she exchanged the security of her native country for her post of danger in Brussels. \"My duty is there,\" she said simply.  She reached Brussels in August, 1914, and at once commenced her humanitarian work. When the German army entered the gates of Brussels, she called upon Governor von Luttwitz and placed her staff of nurses at the services of the wounded under whatever flag they had fought. The services which she and her staff of nurses rendered many a wounded and dying German should have earned for her the generous consideration of the invader.  But early in these ministrations of mercy she was obliged by the noblest of humanitarian motives to antagonize the German invaders. Governor von Luttwitz demanded of her that all nurses should give formal undertakings, when treating wounded French or Belgian soldiers, to act as jailers to their patients, but Miss Cavell answered this unreasonable demand by simply saying: \"We are prepared to do all that we can to help wounded soldiers to recover, but to be their jailers--never.\"  On another occasion, when appealing to a German Brigadier-General on behalf of some homeless women and children, the Prussian martinet--half pedant and half poltroon--answered her with a quotation from Nietzsche to the effect that \"Pity is a waste of feeling--a moral parasite injurious to the health.\" She early felt the cruel and iron will of the invader, but, nothing daunted, she proceeded in the arduous work, supervised the work of three hospitals, gave six lectures on nursing a week and responded to many urgent appeals of individuals who were in need of immediate relief. \"Others she saved, herself she could not save.\"  When one of her associates, Miss Mary Boyle O'Reilly, who has recently contributed a moving account of Miss Cavell's work, was expelled from Belgium, she begged Miss Cavell to take the opportunity, while it presented itself, to leave that land of horror, and Miss Cavell, with characteristic bravery, replied smilingly: \"Impossible, my friend, my duty is here.\"  It was undoubtedly in connection with this humanitarian work that she violated the German military law by giving refuge to fugitive French and Belgian soldiers until such time as they could escape across the frontier to Holland. For this she suffered the penalty of death, and the validity of this sentence, even under Prussian military law, I will discuss later. It is enough to say that no instinct is so natural in every man and woman, and especially in woman with the maternal instinct characteristic of her sex, than to give a harbor of refuge to the helpless. All nations have respected this instinctive feeling as one of the redeeming traits of human nature and the history of war, at least in modern times, can be searched in vain for any instance in which anyone, especially a woman, has been condemned to death for yielding to the humanitarian impulse of giving temporary refuge to a fugitive soldier. Such an act is neither espionage nor treason, as those terms have been ordinarily understood in civilized countries.  It is true, as suggested by a few in America who sought to excuse the Cavell crime, that Mrs. Surratt was tried, condemned and executed because she had permitted the band of assassins, whose conspiracy resulted in the assassination of Lincoln and the attempted murder of Secretary Seward, to hold their meetings in her house; but the difference between this conscious participation in the assassination of the head of the State, in a period of civil war, and the humanitarian aid which Miss Cavell gave to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20335"],["title","The Case of Edith Cavell (#2)"],["body","soldiers to save them from capture is manifest. I am assuming that Miss Cavell did give such protection to her compatriots, for all accessible information supports this view, and if so, however commendable her motive and heroic her conduct, she certainly was guilty of an infraction of military law, which justified some punishment and possibly her forcible detention during the period of the war.  To regard her execution as an ordinary incident of war is an affront to civilization, and as it is symptomatic of the Prussian occupation of Belgium and not a sporadic incident, it acquires a significance which justifies a full recital of this black chapter of Prussianism. It illustrates the reign of terror which has existed in Belgium since the German occupation.  When the German Chancellor made his famous speech in the Reichstag on August 4th, 1914, and admitted at the bar of the world the crime which was then being initiated, he said:       \"The wrong--I speak openly--that we are committing we will endeavor      to make good as soon as our military goal has been reached.\"  Within a few weeks the military goal was reached by the seizure of practically all of Belgium and by the voluntary surrender of Brussels to the invader, and since then, for a period of fourteen months, the Belgian people have been subjected to a state of tyranny for which it would be difficult to find a parallel, unless we turned to the history of the Netherlands in the Sixteenth Century and recalled its occupation by the Duke of Alva. It must be said in candor that the Prussian occupation of Belgium has not yet caused as many victims as the \"Bloody Council\" of the Duke of Alva, for the estimated number of non-combatants, who have been shot in Belgium during the last fourteen months, is only 6,000 as against the 18,000 whom it is estimated the Duke of Alva mercilessly put to death.  It may also be the fact that the present oppression of Belgium is marked by some approach to the forms of law; but it may be doubted whether the difference is not more in appearance than in reality, for the administration of law in Belgium has been a mockery. Of this there can be no more striking or detailed proof than the protest which was presented to the German authorities on February 17th, 1915, by M. Léon Théodor, the head of the Brussels bar. The truth of this formal accusation may be fairly measured by the strong probability that the brave leader of the Brussels bar would never have ventured to have made the statements hereinafter referred to to the German Military Governor unless he was reasonably sure of his facts. What he said on behalf of the bar of Brussels was said in the shadow of possible death, and if he had consciously or deliberately maligned the Prussian administration of justice in this open and specific manner, he assuredly took his life into his hands. This brave and noble document will forever remain one of the gravest indictments of German misrule, and as it states, on the authority of one who was in a position to know, the details of the savage tyranny which masqueraded under the forms of law, it is appended, with some condensation, to this article.  After stating the fact \"that everything about the German judicial organisation in Belgium is contrary to the principles of law,\" and after showing that Belgian civilians were punished for the violations of law which had never been proclaimed and of which, therefore, they knew nothing, the distinguished President of the Order of Advocates says:       \"_This absence of certainty is not only the negation of all the      principles of law; it weighs on the mind and on the conscience; it      bewilders one, it seems to be a permanent menace for all, and the      danger is all the more real, because these courts permit neither      public nor defensive procedure, nor do they permit the accused to      receive any communication regarding his case, nor is any right of      defense assured him._       \"This is arbitrary injustice; the Judge left to himself, that is,      to his impressions, his prejudices, and his surroundings. This is      abandoning the accused in his distress, to grapple alone with his      all-powerful adversary.       \"This justice uncontrolled, and consequently without guarantee,      constitutes for us the most dangerous and oppressive of      illegalities. _We cannot conceive justice as a judicial or moral      possibility without free defense._       \"Free defense, that is, light thrown on all the elements of the      suit; public sentiment being heard in the bosom of the judgment      hall, the right to say everything in the most respectful manner,      and also the courage to dare everything, these must be put at the      service of the unfortunate one, of justice and law.       \"It is one of the greatest conquests of our history. It is the      keystone of our individual liberty.       \"_What are your sources of information?_       \"Besides the judges, the men of the Secret Service and the      denouncers (in French: 'délateurs').       \"The Secret Service men in civilian clothes, not bearing any      insignia, mixing with the crowds in the street, in the cafés, on      the platforms of street cars, listen to the conversations carried      on around them, ready to grasp any secret, on the watch not only      for acts but for intentions.       \"These denouncers of our nation are ever multiplying. _What      confidence can be placed in their declarations, inspired by hate,      spite, or low cupidity?_ Such assistants can bring to the cause of      justice no useful collaboration.       \"If we add to this total absence of control and of defense, these      preventive arrests, the long detentions, the searches in the      private domiciles, _we shall have an almost complete idea of the      moral tortures to which our aspirations, our convictions, and our      liberties are subjected at the present time_. * * *       \"Will it be said that we are living under martial law: that we are      submitting to the hard necessities of war: that all should give way      before the superior interests of your armies?       \"_I can understand martial law for armies in the field. It is the      immediate reply to an aggression against the troops, repression      without words, the summary justice of the commander of the army      responsible for his soldiers._       \"_But our armies are far away; we are no longer in the zone of      military operations. Nothing here menaces your troops, the      inhabitants are calm._       \"The people have taken up work again. You have bidden them do it.      Each one devotes himself, Magistrates, Judges, officials of the      provinces and cities, the clergy, all are at their post, united in      one outburst of national interest and brotherhood.       \"However, this calm does not mean that they have forgotten.       \"The Belgian people lived happily in their corner of the earth,      confident in their dream of independence. They saw this dream      dispelled, they saw their country ruined and devastated, its      ancient hospitable soil has been sown with thousands of tombs where      our own sleep; the war has made tears flow which no hand can dry.      _No, the murdered soul of Belgium will never forget._       \"But this nation has a profound respect for its duty. It will      always respect it.       \"Has not the hour come to consider as closed the period of invasion      and to substitute for the measures of exception the rules of      occupation as defined by international law and the treaty of The      Hague, which sets a limit to the occupying power and imposes      obligations on the country occupied?       \"Has not the hour arrived to restore the Court House to the      judiciary corps? The military occupation of the Court House is a      violation of the treaty of The Hague.       \"Among the moral forces does one exist that is superior to justice?      Justice dominates them all. _As ancient as humanity itself, eternal      as the need of man and nations to be and to feel protected, it is      the basis of all civilization._ The arts and sciences are its      tributaries. Religious creeds live and prosper in its shadow. Is it      not a religion in itself?       \"Belgium raised a magnificent temple to Justice in its capital.       \"This temple, which is our pride, has been converted into barracks      for the German soldiers. A small part of it, becoming smaller every      day, is reserved for the courts. The Magistrates and lawyers have      access to it by a small private staircase.       \"Sad as are the conditions under which they are called to      administer justice, the Judges have decided, nevertheless, to sit.      The Bar has co-operated with them. Accustomed to live in an      atmosphere of deference and of dignity, they do not recognize      themselves in this sort of guard-room, and, in fact, justice      surrounded with so little respect, is it still justice?\"  As this dignified and noble protest did not lead to any amelioration of the harsh conditions, a month later the same brave jurist, M. Léon Théodor, appeared in Brussels before the so-called \"German Court of Justice\" and, in behalf of the entire Magistracy of Belgium, addressed to the Prussian Military Judges the following poignantly pathetic and nobly dignified address, which met with the same reception as the preceding communication.  The address reads as follows:       \"I present myself at the Bar, escorted by the Counsel of the Order,      surrounded by the sympathy and the confidence of all my colleagues      of Brussels, and I might add of all the Bars of the country. The      Bars of Liège, Ghent, Charleroi, Mons, Louvain, Antwerp have sent      to that of Brussels the expression of their professional solidarity      and have declared that they adhere to the resolutions taken by the      Counsel of the Order of Brussels. * * *       \"We are not annexed.
