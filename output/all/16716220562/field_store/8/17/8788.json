[_Puts the letter into her bosom._    Now to the letter of my lord the king:    He wills me to repair unto the court,    And meet my Gaveston: why do I stay,    Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day?--    Who's there?  Baldock!    See that my coach be ready; I must hence. _Bald._ It shall be done, madam. _Niece._ And meet me at the park-pale presently          [_Exit Baldock._    Spenser, stay you, and bear me company,    For I have joyful news to tell thee of;    My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,    And will be at the court as soon as we. _Y. Spen._ I knew the king would have him home again. _Niece._ If all things sort out, as I hope they will,    Thy service, Spenser, shall be thought upon. _Y. Spen._ I humbly thank your ladyship. _Niece._ Come, lead the way: I long till I am there.           [_Exeunt._  _Enter_ KING EDWARD, QUEEN ISABELLA, KENT, LANCASTER,      _the younger_ MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and_      Attendants.  _K. Edw._ The wind is good; I wonder why he stays:    I fear me he is wreck'd upon the sea. _Q. Isab._ Look, Lancaster, how passionate he is,    And still his mind runs on his minion! _Lan._ My lord,-- _K. Edw._ How now! what news? is Gaveston arriv'd? _Y. Mor._ Nothing but Gaveston! what means your grace?    You have matters of more weight to think upon:    The King of France sets foot in Normandy. _K. Edw._ A trifle! we'll expel him when we please.    But tell me, Mortimer, what's thy device    Against the stately triumph we decreed? _Y. Mor._ A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling. _K. Edw._ Pray thee, let me know it. _Y. Mor._ But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is;    A lofty cedar tree, fair flourishing,    On whose top branches kingly eagles perch,    And by the bark a canker creeps me up,    And gets unto the highest bough of all;    The motto, _Æque tandem._ _K. Edw._ And what is yours, my Lord of Lancaster? _Lan._ My lord, mine's more obscure than Mortimer's.    Pliny reports, there is a flying-fish    Which all the other fishes deadly hate,    And therefore, being pursu'd, it takes the air:    No sooner is it up, but there's a fowl    That seizeth it: this fish, my lord, I bear;    The motto this, _Undique mors est._ _Kent._ Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster!    Is this the love you bear your sovereign?    Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears?    Can you in words make show of amity,    And in your shields display your rancorous minds?    What call you this but private libelling    Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother? _Q. Isab._ Sweet husband, be content; they all love you. _K. Edw._ They love me not that hate my Gaveston.    I am that cedar; shake me not too much;    And you the eagles; soar ye ne'er so high,    I have the jesses that will pull you down;    And _Æque tandem_ shall that canker cry    Unto the proudest peer of Britainy.    Thou that compar'st him to a flying-fish,    And threaten'st death whether he rise or fall,    'Tis not the hugest monster of the sea,    Nor foulest harpy, that shall swallow him. _Y. Mor._ If in his absence thus he favours him,    What will he do whenas he shall be present? _Lan._ That shall we see: look, where his lordship come!                     _Enter_ GAVESTON.  _K. Edw._ My Gaveston!    Welcome to Tynmouth! welcome to thy friend!    Thy absence made me droop and pine away;    For, as the lovers of fair Danaë,    When she was lock'd up in a brazen tower,    Desir'd her more, and wax'd outrageous,    So did it fare with me: and now thy sight    Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence    Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart. _Gav._ Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth mine;    Yet have I words left to express my joy:    The shepherd, nipt with biting winter's rage,    Frolics not more to see the painted spring    Than I do to behold your majesty. _K. Edw._ Will none of you salute my Gaveston? _Lan._ Salute him! yes.--Welcome, Lord Chamberlain! _Y. Mor._ Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall! _War._ Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man! _Pem._ Welcome, Master Secretary! _Kent._ Brother, do you hear them? _K. Edw._ Still will these earls and barons use me thus? _Gav._ My lord, I cannot brook these injuries. _Q. Isab._ Ay me, poor soul, when these begin to jar!           [_Aside._ _K. Edw._ Return it to their throats; I'll be thy warrant. _Gav._ Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,    Go sit at home, and eat your tenants' beef;    And come not here to scoff at Gaveston,    Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low    As to bestow a look on such as you. _Lan._ Yet I disdain not to do this for you.                          [_Draws his sword, and offers to stab Gaveston._ _K. Edw._ Treason! treason! where's the traitor? _Pem._ Here, here! _K. Edw._ Convey hence Gaveston; they'll murder him. _Gav._ The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace. _Y. Mor._ Villain, thy life! unless I miss mine aim.  [_Wounds Gaveston._ _Q. Isab._ Ah, furious Mortimer, what hast thou done. _Y. Mor._ No more than I would answer, were he slain.                                         [_Exit Gaveston with Attendants._ _K. Edw._ Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live:    Dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:    Out of my presence! come not near the court. _Y. Mor._ I'll not be barr'd the court for Gaveston. _Lan._ We'll hale him by the ears unto the block. _K. Edw._ Look to your own heads; his is sure enough. _War._ Look to your own crown, if you back him thus. _Kent._ Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years. _K. Edw._ Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus:    But, if I live, I'll tread upon their heads    That think with high looks thus to tread me down.    Come, Edmund, let's away, and levy men:    'Tis war that must abate these barons' pride.                          [_Exeunt King Edward, Queen Isabella, and Kent._ _War._ Let's to our castles, for the king is mov'd. _Y. Mor._ Mov'd may he be, and perish in his wrath! _Lan._ Cousin, it is no dealing with him now;    He means to make us stoop by force of arms:    And therefore let us jointly here protest    To prosecute that Gaveston to the death. _Y. Mor._ By heaven, the abject villain shall not live! _War._ I'll have his blood, or die in seeking it. _Pem._ The like oath Pembroke takes. _Lan._ And so doth Lancaster.    Now send our heralds to defy the king;    And make the people swear to put him down.                       _Enter a_ Messenger.  _Y. Mor._ Letters! from whence? _Mes._ From Scotland, my lord.             [_Giving letters to Mortimer._ _Lan._ Why, how now, cousin! how fare all our friends? _Y. Mor._ My uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots. _Lan._ We'll have him ransom'd, man: be of good cheer. _Y. Mor._ They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.    Who should defray the money but the king,    Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?    I'll to the king. _Lan._ Do, cousin, and I'll bear thee company. _War._ Meantime my Lord of Pembroke and myself    Will to Newcastle here, and gather head. _Y. Mor._ About it, then, and we will follow you. _Lan._ Be resolute and full of secrecy. _War._ I warrant you.                              [_Exit with Pembroke._ _Y. Mor._ Cousin, an if he will not ransom him,    I'll thunder such a peal into his ears    As never subject did unto his king. _Lan._ Content; I'll bear my part.--Hollo! who's there?                         _Enter_ Guard.  _Y. Mor._ Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well. _Lan._ Lead on the way. _Guard._ Whither will your lordships? _Y. Mor._ Whither else but to the king? _Guard._ His highness is dispos'd to be alone. _Lan._ Why, so he may; but we will speak to him. _Guard._ You may not in, my lord. _Y. Mor._ May we not?             _Enter_ KING EDWARD _and_ KENT.  _K. Edw._ How now!    What noise is this? who have we here? is't you?              [_Going._ _Y. Mor._ Nay, stay, my lord; I come to bring you news;    Mine uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots. _K. Edw._ Then ransom him. _Lan._ 'Twas in your wars; you should ransom him. _Y. Mor._ And you will ransom him, or else-- _Kent._ What, Mortimer, you will not threaten him? _K. Edw._ Quiet yourself; you shall have the broad seal,    To gather for him th[o]roughout the realm. _Lan._ Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this. _Y. Mor._ My lord, the family of the Mortimers    Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land,    'Twould levy men enough to anger you.    We never beg, but use such prayers as these. _K. Edw._ Shall I still be haunted thus? _Y. Mor._ Nay, now you are here alone, I'll speak my mind. _Lan._ And so will I; and then, my lord, farewell. _Y. Mor._ The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows,    And prodigal gifts bestow'd on Gaveston,    Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak;    The murmuring commons, overstretched, break. _Lan._ Look for rebellion, look to be depos'd:    Thy garrisons are beaten out of France,    And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates;    The wild Oneil, with swarms of Irish kerns,    Lives uncontroll'd within the English pale;    Unto the walls of York the Scots make road,    And, unresisted, drive away rich spoils. _Y. Mor._ The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas,    While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg'd. _Lan._ What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors? _Y. Mor._ Who loves thee, but a sort of flatterers? _Lan._ Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois,    Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn. _Y. Mor._ Thy court is naked, being bereft of those    That make a king seem glorious to the world,    I mean the peers, whom thou shouldst dearly love;    Libels are cast against thee in the street;    Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow. _Lan._ The northern borderers, seeing their houses burnt,    Their wives and children slain,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20288"],["title","Edward the Second (#5)"],["body"," up and down,    Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston. _Y. Mor._ When wert thou in the field with banner spread,    But once? and then thy soldiers march'd like players,    With garish robes, not armour; and thyself,    Bedaub'd with gold, rode laughing at the rest,    Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest,    Where women's favours hung like labels down. _Lan._ And thereof came it that the fleering Scots,    To England's high disgrace, have made this jig;    _Maids of England, sore may you mourn,    For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn,--    With a heave and a ho!    What weeneth the king of England    So soon to have won Scotland!--    With a rombelow!_ _Y. Mor._ Wigmore shall fly, to set my uncle free. _Lan._ And, when 'tis gone, our swords shall purchase more.    If you be mov'd, revenge it as you can:    Look next to see us with our ensigns spread.  [_Exit with Y. Mortimer._ _K. Edw._ My swelling heart for very anger breaks:    How oft have I been baited by these peers,    And dare not be reveng'd, for their power is great!    Yet, shall the crowning of these cockerels    Affright a lion?  Edward, unfold thy paws,    And let their lives'-blood slake thy fury's hunger.    If I be cruel and grow tyrannous,    Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late. _Kent._ My lord, I see your love to Gaveston    Will be the ruin of the realm and you,    For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars;    And therefore, brother, banish him for ever. _K. Edw._ Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston? _Kent._ Ay; and it grieves me that I favour'd him. _K. Edw._ Traitor, be gone! whine thou with Mortimer. _Kent._ So will I, rather than with Gaveston. _K. Edw._ Out of my sight, and trouble me no more! _Kent._ No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers,    When I thy brother am rejected thus. _K. Edw._ Away!                                             [_Exit Kent._    Poor Gaveston, thou hast no friend but me!    Do what they can, we'll live in Tynmouth here;    And, so I walk with him about the walls,    What care I though the earls begirt us round?    Here comes she that is cause of all these jars.  _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, _with_ EDWARD'S NIECE, _two_ Ladies,        GAVESTON, BALDOCK, _and the younger_ SPENSER.  _Q. Isab._ My lord, 'tis thought the earls are up in arms. _K. Edw._ Ay, and 'tis likewise thought you favour 'em. _Q. Isab._ Thus do you still suspect me without cause. _Niece._ Sweet uncle, speak more kindly to the queen. _Gav._ My lord, dissemble with her; speak her fair. _K. Edw._ Pardon me, sweet; I forgot myself. _Q. Isab._ Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel. _K. Edw._ The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,    That to my face he threatens civil wars. _Gav._ Why do you not commit him to the Tower? _K. Edw._ I dare not, for the people love him well. _Gav._ Why, then, we'll have him privily made away. _K. Edw._ Would Lancaster and he had both carous'd    A bowl of poison to each other's health!    But let them go, and tell me what are these. _Niece._ Two of my father's servants whilst he liv'd:    May't please your grace to entertain them now. _K. Edw._ Tell me, where wast thou born? what is thine arms? _Bald._ My name is Baldock, and my gentry    I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry. _K. Edw._ The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.    Wait on me, and I'll see thou shalt not want. _Bald._ I humbly thank your majesty. _K. Edw._ Knowest thou him, Gaveston. _Gav._ Ay, my lord;    His name is Spenser; he is well allied:    For my sake let him wait upon your grace;    Scarce shall you find a man of more desert. _K. Edw._ Then, Spenser, wait upon me for his sake:    I'll grace thee with a higher style ere long. _Y. Spen._ No greater titles happen unto me    Than to be favour'd of your majesty! _K. Edw._ Cousin, this day shall be your marriage feast:--    And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well,    To wed thee to our niece, the only heir    Unto the Earl of Glocester late deceas'd. _Gav._ I know, my lord, many will stomach me;    But I respect neither their love nor hate. _K. Edw._ The headstrong barons shall not limit me;    He that I list to favour shall be great.    Come, let's away; and, when the marriage ends,    Have at the rebels and their complices!                     [_Exeunt._        _Enter_ KENT, LANCASTER, _the younger_ MORTIMER,               WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _and others._  _Kent._ My lords, of love to this our native land,    I come to join with you, and leave the king;    And in your quarrel, and the realm's behoof,    Will be the first that shall adventure life. _Lan._ I fear me, you are sent of policy,    To undermine us with a show of love. _War._ He is your brother; therefore have we cause    To cast the worst, and doubt of your revolt. _Kent._ Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth:    If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords. _Y. Mor._ Stay, Edmund: never was Plantagenet    False of his word; and therefore trust we thee. _Pem._ But what's the reason you should leave him now? _Kent._ I have inform'd the Earl of Lancaster. _Lan._ And it sufficeth.  Now, my lords, know this,    That Gaveston is secretly arriv'd,    And here in Tynmouth frolics with the king.    Let us with these our followers scale the walls,    And suddenly surprise them unawares. _Y. Mor._ I'll give the onset. _War._ And I'll follow thee. _Y. Mor._ This tatter'd ensign of my ancestors,    Which swept the desert shore of that Dead Sea    Whereof we got the name of Mortimer,    Will I advance upon this castle ['s] walls--    Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,    And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston! _Lan._ None be so hardy as to touch the king;    But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends.             [_Exeunt._     _Enter, severally_ KING EDWARD _and the younger_                         SPENSER.  _K. Edw._ O, tell me, Spenser, where is Gaveston? _Y. Spen._ I fear me he is slain, my gracious lord. _K. Edw._ No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill.       _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA, KING EDWARD'S Niece,                 GAVESTON, _and_ Nobles.     Fly, fly, my lords; the earls have got the hold;    Take shipping, and away to Scarborough:    Spenser and I will post away by land. _Gav._ O, stay, my lord! they will not injure you. _K. Edw._ I will not trust them.  Gaveston, away! _Gav._ Farewell, my lord. _K. Edw._ Lady, farewell. _Niece._ Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again. _K. Edw._ Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece. _Q. Isab._ No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen? _K. Edw._ Yes, yes, for Mortimer your lover's sake. _Q. Isab._ Heavens can witness, I love none but you.                                      [_Exeunt all except Queen Isabella._    From my embracements thus he breaks away.    O, that mine arms could close this isle about,    That I might pull him to me where I would!    Or that these tears, that drizzle from mine eyes,    Had power to mollify his stony heart,    That, when I had him, we might never part!  _Enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, _the younger_ MORTIMER, _and                  others.  Alarums within._  _Lan._ I wonder how he scap'd. _Y. Mor._ Who's this? the queen! _Q. Isab._ Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen,    Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted,    And body with continual mourning wasted:    These hands are tir'd with haling of my lord    From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston;    And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair,    He turns away, and smiles upon his minion. _Y. Mor._ Cease to lament, and tell us where's the king? _Q. Isab._ What would you with the king? is't him you seek? _Lan._ No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston:    Far be it from the thought of Lancaster    To offer violence to his sovereign!    We would but rid the realm of Gaveston:    Tell us where he remains, and he shall die. _Q. Isab._ He's gone by water unto Scarborough:    Pursue him quickly, and he cannot scape;    The king hath left him, and his train is small. _War._ Forslow no time, sweet Lancaster; let's march. _Y. Mor._ How comes it that the king and he is parted? _Q. Isab._ That thus your army, going several ways,    Might be of lesser force, and with the power    That he intendeth presently to raise,    Be easily suppress'd: therefore be gone. _Y. Mor._ Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy:    Let's all aboard, and follow him amain. _Lan._ The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails;    Come, come, aboard! 'tis but an hour's sailing. _Y. Mor._ Madam, stay you within this castle here. _Q. Isab._ No, Mortimer; I'll to my lord the king. _Y. Mor._ Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough. _Q. Isab._ You know the king is so suspicious    As, if he hear I have but talk'd with you,    Mine honour will be call'd in question;    And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone. _Y. Mor._ Madam, I cannot stay to answer you:    But think of Mortimer as he deserves.                                      [_Exeunt all except Queen Isabella._ _Q. Isab._ So well hast thou deserv'd, sweet Mortimer,    As Isabel could live with thee for ever.    In vain I look for love at Edward's hand,    Whose eyes are fix'd on none but Gaveston.    Yet once more I'll importune him with prayer:    If he be strange, and not regard my words,    My son and I will over into France,    And to the king my brother there complain    How Gaveston hath robb'd me of his love:    But yet, I hope, my sorrows will have end,    And Gaveston this blessed day be slain.                       [_Exit._                     _Enter_ GAVESTON, _pursued._  _Gav._ Yet, lusty lords, I have escap'd your hands,    Your threats, your 'larums, and your hot pursuits;    And, though divorced from King Edward's eyes,    Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris'd,    Breathing in hope (malgrado all your beards,    That muster rebels thus against your king)    To see his royal sovereign once again.  _Enter_ WARWICK, LANCASTER, PEMBROKE, _the younger_      MORTIMER, Soldiers, JAMES _and other_ Attendants _of_      PENBROKE.  _War._"]]]
