The blood suddenly grew hot in Fairchild's veins; he whistled, he repressed a wild, spasmodic desire to shout.  The spirit that had been the spirit of the determined men of the emigrant trains was his now; he remembered that he was traveling slowly toward a fight--against whom, or what, he knew not--but he welcomed it just the same.  The exaltation of rarefied atmosphere was in his brain; dingy offices were gone forever.  He was free; and for the first time in his life, he appreciated the meaning of the word.  Upward, still upward!  The town below became merely a checkerboard thing, the lake a dot of gleaming silver, the stream a scintillating ribbon stretching off into the foothills.  A turn, and they skirted a tremendous valley, its slopes falling away in sheer descents from the roadway.  A darkened, moist stretch of road, fringed by pines, then a jogging journey over rolling table-land.  At last came a voice from the driver's seat, and Fairchild turned like a man suddenly awakened.  \"Turn off up here at Genesee Mountain.  Which way do you go?\"  \"Trying to get to Ohadi.\"  Fairchild shouted it above the roar of the engine.  The driver waved a hand forward.  \"Keep to the main road.  Drop off when I make the turn.  You 'll pick up another ride soon.  Plenty of chances.\"  \"Thanks for the lift.\"  \"Aw, forget it.\"  The truck wheeled from the main road and chugged away, leaving Fairchild afoot, making as much progress as possible toward his goal until good fortune should bring a swifter means of locomotion.  A half-mile he walked, studying the constant changes of the scenery before him, the slopes and rises, the smooth valleys and jagged crags above, the clouds as they drifted low upon the higher peaks, shielding them from view for a moment, then disappearing.  Then suddenly he wheeled.  Behind him sounded the swift droning of a motor, cut-out open, as it rushed forward along the road,--and the noise told a story of speed.  Far at the brow of a steep hill it appeared, seeming to hang in space for an instant before leaping downward.  Rushing, plunging, once skidding dangerously at a small curve, it made the descent, bumped over a bridge, was lost for a second in the pines, then sped toward him, a big touring car, with a small, resolute figure clinging to the wheel. The quarter of a mile changed to a furlong, the furlong to a hundred yards,--then, with a report like a revolver shot, the machine suddenly slewed in drunken fashion far to one side of the road, hung dangerously over the steep cliff an instant, righted itself, swayed forward and stopped, barely twenty-five yards away.  Staring, Robert Fairchild saw that a small, trim figure had leaped forth and was waving excitedly to him, and he ran forward.  His first glance had proclaimed it a boy; the second had told a different story.  A girl--dressed in far different fashion from Robert Fairchild's limited specifications of feminine garb--she caused him to gasp in surprise, then to stop and stare.  Again she waved a hand and stamped a foot excitedly; a vehement little thing in a snug, whipcord riding habit and a checkered cap pulled tight over closely braided hair, she awaited him with all the impatience of impetuous womanhood.  \"For goodness' sake, come here!\" she called, as he still stood gaping. \"I 'll give you five dollars.  Hurry!\"  Fairchild managed to voice the fact that he would be willing to help without remuneration, as he hurried forward, still staring at her, a vibrant little thing with dark-brown wisps of hair which had been blown from beneath her cap straying about equally dark-brown, snapping eyes and caressing the corners of tightly pressed, momentarily impatient lips.  Only a second she hesitated, then dived for the tonneau, jerking with all her strength at the heavy seat cushion, as he stepped to the running board beside her.  \"Can't get this dinged thing up!\" she panted.  \"Always sticks when you 're in a hurry.  That's it!  Jerk it.  Thanks!  Here!\"  She reached forward and a small, sun-tanned hand grasped a greasy jack, \"Slide under the back axle and put this jack in place, will you?  And rush it! I 've got to change a tire in nothing flat!  Hurry!\"  Fairchild, almost before he knew it, found himself under the rear of the car, fussing with a refractory lifting jack and trying to keep his eyes from the view of trimly clad, brown-shod little feet, as they pattered about at the side of the car, hurried to the running board, then stopped as wrenches and a hammer clattered to the ground.  Then one shoe was raised, to press tight against a wheel; metal touched metal, a feminine gasp sounded as strength was exerted in vain, then eddying dust as the foot stamped, accompanied by an exasperated ejaculation.  \"Ding these old lugs!  They 're rusted!  Got that jack in place yet?\"  \"Yes!  I'm raising the car now.\"  \"Oh, please hurry.\"  There was pleading in the tone now.  \"Please!\"  The car creaked upward.  Out came Fairchild, brushing the dust from his clothes.  But already the girl was pressing the lug wrench into his hands.  \"Don't mind that dirt,\" came her exclamation.  \"I 'll--I 'll give you some extra money to get your suit cleaned.  Loosen those lugs, while I get the spare tire off the back.  And for goodness' sake, please hurry!\"  Astonishment had taken away speech for Fairchild.  He could only wonder--and obey.  Swiftly he twirled the wrench while lug after lug fell to the ground, and while the girl, struggling with a tire seemingly almost as big as herself, trundled the spare into position to await the transfer.  As for Fairchild, he was in the midst of a task which he had seen performed far more times than he had done it himself. He strove to remove the blown-out shoe with the cap still screwed on the valve stem; he fussed and swore under his breath, and panted, while behind him a girl in whipcord riding habit and close-pulled cap fidgeted first on one tan-clad foot, then on the other, anxiously watching the road behind her and calling constantly for speed.  At last the job was finished, the girl fastening the useless shoe behind the machine while Fairchild tightened the last of the lugs. Then as he straightened, a small figure shot to his side, took the wrench from his hand and sent it, with the other tools, clattering into the tonneau.  A tiny hand went into a pocket, something that crinkled was shoved into the man's grasp, and while he stood there gasping, she leaped to the driver's seat, slammed the door, spun the starter until it whined, and with open cutout roaring again, was off and away, rocking down the mountain side, around a curve and out of sight--while Fairchild merely stood there, staring wonderingly at a ten-dollar bill!  A noise from the rear, growing louder, and the amazed man turned to see a second machine, filled with men, careening toward him.  Fifty feet away the brakes creaked, and the big automobile came to a skidding, dust-throwing stop.  A sun-browned man in a Stetson hat, metal badge gleaming from beneath his coat, leaned forth.  \"Which way did he go?\"  \"He?\"  Robert Fairchild stared.  \"Yeh.  Did n't a man just pass here in an automobile?  Where'd he go--straight on the main road or off on the circuit trail?\"  \"It--it was n't a man.\"  \"Not a man?\"  The four occupants of the machine stared at him.  \"Don't try to bull us that it was a woman.\"  \"Oh, no--no--of course not.\"  Fairchild had found his senses.  \"But it was n't a man.  It--it was a boy, just about fifteen years old.\"  \"Sure?\"  \"Oh, yes--\"  Fairchild was swimming in deep water now.  \"I got a good look at him.  He--he took that road off to the left.\"  It was the opposite one to which the hurrying fugitive in whipcord had taken.  There was doubt in the interrogator's eyes.  \"Sure of that?\" he queried.  \"I 'm the sheriff of Arapahoe County. That's an auto bandit ahead of us.  We--\"  \"Well, I would n't swear to it.  There was another machine ahead, and I lost 'em both for a second down there by the turn.  I did n't see the other again, but I did get a glimpse of one off on that side road.  It looked like the car that passed me.  That's all I know.\"  \"Probably him, all right.\"  The voice came from the tonneau.  \"Maybe he figured to give us the slip and get back to Denver.  You did n't notice the license number?\"  This to Fairchild.  That bewildered person shook his head.  \"No.  Did n't you?\"  \"Could n't--covered with dust when we first took the trail and never got close enough afterward.  But it was the same car--that's almost a cinch.\"  \"Let's go!\"  The sheriff was pressing a foot on the accelerator.  Down the hill went the car, to skid, then to make a short turn on to the road which led away from the scent, leaving behind a man standing in the middle of the road, staring at a ten-dollar bill,--and wondering why he had lied!     CHAPTER IV  Wonderment which got nowhere.  The sheriff's car returned before Fairchild reached the bottom of the grade, and again stopped to survey the scene of defeat, while Fairchild once more told his story, deleting items which, to him, appeared unnecessary for consumption by officers of the law.  Carefully the sheriff surveyed the winding road before him and scratched his head.  \"Don't guess it would have made much difference which way he went,\" came ruefully at last, \"I never saw a fellow turn loose with so much speed on a mountain road.  We never could have caught him!\"  \"Dangerous character?\"  Fairchild hardly knew why he asked the question.  The sheriff smiled grimly.  \"If it was the fellow we were after, he was plenty dangerous.  We were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20104"],["title","The Cross-Cut (#4)"],["body"," him on word from Denver--described the car and said he 'd pulled a daylight hold-up on a pay-wagon for the Smelter Company--so when the car went through Golden, we took up the trail a couple of blocks behind.  He kept the same speed for a little while until one of my deputies got a little anxious and took a shot at a tire.  Man, how he turned on the juice!  I thought that thing was a jack rabbit the way it went up the hill!  We never had a chance after that!\"  \"And you 're sure it was the same person?\"  The sheriff toyed with the gear shift.  \"You never can be sure about nothing in this business,\" came finally. \"But there 's this to think about: if that fellow was n't guilty of something, why did he run?\"  \"It might have been a kid in a stolen machine,\" came from the back seat.  \"If it was, we 've got to wait until we get a report on it.  I guess it's us back to the office.\"  The automobile went its way then, and Fairchild his, still wondering; the sheriff's question, with a different gender, recurring again and again:  \"If she was n't guilty of something, why did she run?\"  And why had she?  More, why had she been willing to give ten dollars in payment for the mere changing of a tire?  And why had she not offered some explanation of it all?  It was a problem which almost wiped out for Robert Fairchild the zest of the new life into which he was going, the great gamble he was about to take.  And so thoroughly did it engross him that it was not until a truck had come to a full stop behind him, and a driver mingled a shout with the tooting of his horn, that he turned to allow its passage.  \"Did n't hear you, old man,\" he apologized.  \"Could you give a fellow a lift?\"  \"Guess so.\"  It was friendly, even though a bit disgruntled; \"hop on.\"  And Fairchild hopped, once more to sit on the tailboard, swinging his legs, but this time his eyes saw the ever-changing scenery without noticing it.  In spite of himself, Fairchild found himself constantly staring at a vision of a pretty girl in a riding habit, with dark-brown hair straying about equally dark-brown eyes, almost frenzied in her efforts to change a tire in time to elude a pursuing sheriff.  Some way, it all did n't blend.  Pretty girls, no doubt, could commit infractions of the law just as easily as ones less gifted with good looks.  Yet if this particular pretty girl had held up a pay wagon, why did n't the telephoned notice from Denver state the fact, instead of referring to her as a man?  And if she had n't committed some sort of depredation against the law, why on earth was she willing to part with ten dollars, merely to save a few moments in changing a tire and thus elude a sheriff?  If there had been nothing wrong, could not a moment of explanation have satisfied any one of the fact?  Anyway, were n't the officers looking for a man instead of for a woman?  And yet:  \"If she was n't guilty of something, why did she run?\"  It was too much for any one, and Fairchild knew it.  Yet he clung grimly to the mystery as the truck clattered on, mile after mile, while the broad road led along the sides of the hills, finally to dip downward and run beside the bubbling Clear Creek,--clear no longer in the memory of the oldest inhabitant; but soiled by the silica from ore deposits that, churned and rechurned, gave to the stream a whitish, almost milk-like character, as it twisted in and out of the tortuous cañon on its turbulent journey to the sea.  But Fairchild failed to notice either that or the fact that ancient, age-whitened water wheels had begun to appear here and there, where gulch miners, seekers after gold in the silt of the creek's bed, had abandoned them years before; that now and then upon the hills showed the gaunt scars of mine openings,--reminders of dreams of a day long past; or even the more important fact that in the distance, softened by the mellowing rays of a dying sun, a small town gradually was coming into view.  A mile more, then the truck stopped with a jerk.  \"Where you bound for, pardner?\"  Fairchild turned absently, then grinned in embarrassment.  \"Ohadi.\"  \"That's it, straight ahead.  I turn off here.  Stranger?\"  \"Yep.\"  \"Miner?\"  Fairchild shrugged his shoulders and nodded noncommittally.  The truck driver toyed with his wheel.  \"Just thought I 'd ask.  Plenty of work around here for single and double jackers.  Things are beginning to look up a bit--at least in silver.  Gold mines ain't doing much yet--but there 's a good deal happening with the white stuff.\"  \"Thanks.  Do you know a good place to stop?\"  \"Yeh.  Mother Howard's Boarding House.  Everybody goes there, sooner or later.  You 'll see it on the left-hand side of the street before you get to the main block.  Good old girl; knows how to treat anybody in the mining game from operators on down.  She was here when mining was mining!\"  Which was enough recommendation for Mother Howard.  Fairchild lifted his bag from the rear of the vehicle, waved a farewell to the driver and started into the village.  And then--for once--the vision of the girl departed, momentarily, to give place to other thoughts, other pictures, of a day long gone.  The sun was slanting low, throwing deep shadows from the hills into the little valley with its chattering, milk-white stream, softening the scars of the mountains with their great refuse dumps; reminders of hopes of twenty years before and as bare of vegetation as in the days when the pick and gad and drill of the prospector tore the rock loose from its hiding place under the surface of the ground.  Nature, in the mountainous country, resents any outrage against her dignity; the scars never heal; the mine dumps of a score of years ago remain the same, without a single shrub or weed or blade of grass growing in the big heaps of rocky refuse to shield them.  But now it was all softened and aglow with sunset.  The deep red buildings of the Argonaut tunnel--a great, criss-crossing hole through the hills that once connected with more than thirty mines and their feverish activities--were denuded of their rust and lack of repair. The steam from the air-compressing engine, furnishing the necessary motive power for the drills that still worked in the hills, curled upward in billowy, rainbow-like coloring.  The scrub pines of the almost barren mountains took on a fluffier, softer tone; the jutting rocks melted away into their own shadows, it was a picture of peace and of memories.  And it had been here that Thornton Fairchild, back in the nineties, had dreamed his dreams and fought his fight.  It had been here--somewhere in one of the innumerable cañons that led away from the little town on every side--that Thornton Fairchild had followed the direction of \"float ore\" to its resting place, to pursue the vagrant vein through the hills, to find it at last, to gloat over it in his letters to Beamish and then to--what?  A sudden cramping caught the son's heart, and it pounded with something akin to fear.  The old foreboding of his father's letter had come upon him, the mysterious thread of that elusive, intangible Thing, great enough to break the will and resistance of a strong man and turn him into a weakling--silent, white-haired--sitting by a window, waiting for death.  What had it been?  Why had it come upon his father?  How could it be fought?  All so suddenly, Robert Fairchild had realized that he was in the country of the invisible enemy, there to struggle against it without the slightest knowledge of what it was or how it could be combated.  His forehead felt suddenly damp and cold.  He brushed away the beady perspiration with a gesture almost of anger, then with a look of relief, turned in at a small white gate toward a big, rambling building which proclaimed itself, by the sign on the door, to be Mother Howard's Boarding House.  A moment of waiting, then he faced a gray-haired, kindly faced woman, who stared at him with wide-open eyes as she stood, hands on hips, before him.  \"Don't you tell me I don't know you!\" she burst forth at last.  \"I 'm afraid you don't.\"  \"Don't I?\" Mother Howard cocked her head.  \"If you ain't a Fairchild, I 'll never feed another miner corned beef and cabbage as long as I live. Ain't you now?\" she persisted, \"ain't you a Fairchild?\"  The man laughed in spite of himself.  \"You guessed it.\"  \"You 're Thornton Fairchild's boy!\"  She had reached out for his handbag, and then, bustling about him, drew him into the big \"parlor\" with its old-fashioned, plush-covered chairs, its picture album, its glass-covered statuary on the old, onyx mantel.  \"Did n't I know you the minute I saw you?  Land, you're the picture of your dad!  Sakes alive, how is he?\"  There was a moment of silence.  Fairchild found himself suddenly halting and boyish as he stood before her.  \"He 's--he 's gone, Mrs. Howard.\"  \"Dead?\"  She put up both hands.  \"It don't seem possible.  And me remembering him looking just like you, full of life and strong and--\"  \"Our pictures of him are a good deal different.  I--I guess you knew him when everything was all right for him.  Things were different after he got home again.\"  Mother Howard looked quickly about her, then with a swift motion closed the door.  \"Son,\" she asked in a low voice, \"did n't he ever get over it?\"  \"It?\"  Fairchild felt that he stood on the threshold of discoveries. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Didn't he ever tell you anything, Son?\"  \"No.  I--\"  \"Well, there was n't any need to.\"  But Mother Howard's sudden embarrassment, her change of color, told Fairchild it was n't the truth.  \"He just had a little bad luck out here, that was all. His--his mine pinched out just when he thought he 'd struck it rich--or something like that.\"  \"Are you sure that is the truth?\"  For a second they faced each other, Robert Fairchild serious and intent, Mother Howard looking at him with eyes defiant, yet compassionate.  Suddenly they twinkled, the lips broke from their straight line into a smile, and a kindly old hand reached out"]]]
