And there's Jennie Junebug, trying her best to destroy the leaves that I save.... It's enough to make an honest person weep.\"  Perhaps Jennie Junebug wasn't so bad, at heart, as Mrs. Ladybug thought her. Maybe she was merely a gay, careless creature who never stopped to consider that she was injuring Farmer Green when she hurt his trees. At least, that was what some of Mrs. Ladybug's other neighbors sometimes remarked.  But Mrs. Ladybug never could believe that Jennie had a single good trait--unless it was good nature. For she was always ready with a laugh, no matter what anybody said to her.  It was seldom that Mrs. Ladybug hesitated to speak her mind right out to a person if she happened to disapprove of him. But she had always kept out of Jennie Junebug's way. Jennie was many times bigger than little Mrs. Ladybug. Mrs. Ladybug trembled to think what might happen to her if Jennie should ever hurl her fat body against Mrs. Ladybug with a dull, sickening thud.  \"If that ever happens,\" Mrs. Ladybug thought, \"I fear I'll never be able to do another day's work for Farmer Green. It might be the end of me.\"  Now, in spite of her fears, Mrs. Ladybug had even more than her share of courage. And as time went on, and she saw the awful havoc that Jennie Junebug played with the trees, Mrs. Ladybug reached the point where she couldn't any longer stand by silently and let Jennie Junebug riddle the leaves. \"Something will have to be done!\" Mrs. Ladybug declared to her friends. \"I can't compel Jennie Junebug to stop. She's too big for me to handle.  \"I'm going to have a talk with her,\" said Mrs. Ladybug.     XIV  BUMPS   SOME busybody went straight to Jennie Junebug and told her what Mrs. Ladybug had said.  \"Mrs. Ladybug is going to have a talk with you,\" this meddling person told the fat and frolicsome Jennie. \"She wants you to stop eating leaves. She says you are doing your best--or your worst--to hurt the trees that she is trying to save. She claims that you are no friend of Farmer Green's. She--\"  Jennie Junebug broke in upon her companion with a loud laugh.  \"I'd like to have Mrs. Ladybug try to speak to me,\" she chuckled. \"If she does, I'll have fun with her. I'll knock her over. I'll send her spinning.\"  Jennie's friend seemed somewhat alarmed at that.  \"Now, be careful!\" she begged the fat lady. \"Don't forget that Mrs. Ladybug is a little creature! You'll injure her if you're too rough with her.\"  \"Ho! ho!\" laughed Jennie Junebug, and also, \"Ha! ha!\" She had to stop and hold her sides, while she rocked back and forth. \"This is a great joke!\" Jennie cried. \"Imagine Mrs. Ladybug trying to talk with me! Why, she'll be lucky if she can get her breath after I've flown into her once.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the tale-bearer. \"I wish I hadn't mentioned this matter to you. Of course, everybody knows that Mrs. Ladybug talks too much. And I thought maybe you'd enjoy meeting her and making her keep still. But I had no idea you would do her any harm.\"  \"Bless you!\" cried Jennie Junebug. \"I wouldn't harm a hair of her head!\" And she roared with laughter, for she had made a joke. You see, Mrs. Ladybug had no hair. She was quite bald.  Well, Mrs. Ladybug found Jennie Junebug that very evening. She knew that Jennie wasn't often seen except after sunset. For Jennie loved to see the lights twinkling through the gloom. And she delighted in surprising people in the dark, by flying _bang!_ into them and knocking them down. So Mrs. Ladybug didn't leave her work and set out to seek this dangerous fat lady until twilight came.  \"Good evening!\" said Mrs. Ladybug as soon as she spied Miss Junebug. \"Have you a few minutes to spare? If you have, I'd like to talk with you.\"  Jennie Junebug grinned broadly.  \"I can give you a few seconds of my valuable time,\" she replied. \"I was just going over to the meadow, for Freddie Firefly will be there soon. He dances in the meadow every night. And I like to see his flickering light--and watch him bounce when I hit him. So you'll have to talk fast, for I'm in a hurry,\" said Jennie Junebug.  \"Good!\" thought Mrs. Ladybug. \"She's going to listen to me, after all.\" And then she fixed Miss Junebug with her eye and spoke to her severely.  \"Don't you think you ought--\" she began.  And then Jennie Junebug bumped into her, sending Mrs. Ladybug sprawling.  \"Don't I think I ought to frolic with you?\" Jennie cried. \"Certainly I do.\"  Mrs. Ladybug managed to rise off the ground.  \"Won't you please--\" she started to say.  \"Won't I please knock you down? Of course I will!\" Jennie Junebug exclaimed. And thereupon she struck Mrs. Ladybug again.  Poor Mrs. Ladybug was much shaken. In her fall she had dropped her umbrella, and her handkerchief too. But she didn't stop to pick them up. She scrambled to her feet and rose into the air again, angrier than she had ever been before in all her life.  \"I'll thank you--\" she spluttered.  \"You'll thank me if I'll do that again, eh?\" said Jennie Junebug, interrupting her rudely. \"Very well! Here goes!\" This time she gave Mrs. Ladybug a terrific blow. She dropped upon the grass, where she clung to a blade and swayed up and down for a few moments, dizzy and trembling. And she was gasping so hard, in order to get her breath, that she couldn't speak.  Watching her, Jennie Junebug shrieked with laughter. Then, seeing Freddie Firefly's light flashing in the meadow, Miss Junebug hurried away.     XV  ENOUGH!   \"SUCH impudence!\" Mrs. Ladybug gasped, as soon as she could speak. \"That terrible Jennie Junebug didn't care whether I ever got my breath or not.\"  After bowling Mrs. Ladybug over three times, Miss Junebug had flown away, leaving poor little Mrs. Ladybug clinging to a blade of grass and wondering if she would be able to move again.  Mrs. Ladybug had attempted to take Jennie Junebug to task. She had intended to berate Jennie for devouring the leaves of Farmer Green's trees and to order her to stop such damage at once. But Jennie Junebug hadn't allowed her to say much. In her playful way she had knocked the breath out of Mrs. Ladybug.  \"I must try some other plan,\" thought Mrs. Ladybug. \"And I'll have to have help.\" So she sent Miss Moth over to the meadow, to find Freddie Firefly and ask him if he wouldn't come to the orchard because Mrs. Ladybug wanted to talk with him.  He came. He came at once; for he saw Jennie Junebug looking for him. And he was only too glad to escape her attentions. He found her too rough to suit him.  Mrs. Ladybug quickly explained her difficulty.  \"What shall I do?\" she asked him.  \"I don't know,\" he answered. \"I can't do a thing with Jennie Junebug. She knocks me down whenever I meet her. She annoys me.\"  \"It's not so much myself I'm thinking of,\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"It's Farmer Green's fruit trees that I'm disturbed about. Jennie Junebug eats the leaves. I must put an end to that.\"  \"I have it!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed suddenly. \"I'll ask her why she doesn't bump into Solomon Owl!\"  Mrs. Ladybug didn't seem to care for his suggestion. \"What good would that do?\" she inquired.  \"Ah!\" he said. \"Solomon Owl wouldn't let her browbeat him. He'd soon cure her of her rude pranks.\"  \"Then please speak to her, and to Solomon Owl at once--that is, if you dare to,\" said Mrs. Ladybug.  \"I'm not afraid of him,\" Freddie Firefly boasted. \"He won't touch me. He's a-scared of my light.\" And then Freddie Firefly flitted away.  He found Solomon Owl easily enough. He had heard Solomon's _Wha-wha_, _whoo-ah_! booming from the edge of the woods. And he soon persuaded Solomon to fly down into the meadow.  Solomon Owl sailed above the waving grass, while Freddie Firefly spoke to Jennie Junebug.  She liked his scheme. She thought it would be a great joke to bump into solemn Solomon Owl. And for once she forgot to fling herself against Freddie Firefly.  Only a little while later she struck Solomon Owl with an awful thud. To her huge surprise she fell headlong, while he merely paused in his low flight.  \"Who struck me?\" he bawled.  \"Jennie Junebug!\" said Freddie Firefly.  \"Where is she now?\" Solomon hooted. \"If I find her I'll fix her.\"  Jennie Junebug heard everything he said. She was lying hidden in the grass near-by. And she wouldn't have come out for anything.  \"I'll keep an eye out for her,\" Solomon Owl announced. \"I come to the meadow often, a-mousing.\"  Jennie Junebug kept still as a mouse, herself, until Solomon had gone back to the woods. Then she stole forth from her hiding place, showing a battered face to her friends.  \"Good-by, everybody!\" she called. \"I'm going to move. I'm going 'way down to the end of the valley to live.... I'm off already,\" she added, as she spread her wings.  Nobody ever saw Jennie Junebug on Farmer Green's place again.  And Mrs. Ladybug was more than satisfied.     XVI  PLAYING DEAD   FARMER GREEN'S apple trees looked green and flourishing. Thanks to Mrs. Ladybug--and some of her relations--there was scarcely an insect left on the leaves. And since there was no more work to be done in the orchard just then, and nothing for her to eat, Mrs. Ladybug settled among the raspberry bushes near the duck pond. She said that they needed her attention.  One day she paused in her labors, feeling that she had earned a few minutes' rest. And she dropped out of the bushes and strayed close to the water's edge.  A light breeze ruffled the surface of the duck pond into tiny waves.  \"What a terrible, rough sea there is to-day!\" Mrs. Ladybug murmured as she gazed upon the troubled water. \"Perhaps, if I cling to a tall grass stalk, I can get a better view of it.\"  She soon found a stalk that grew high above all the rest. Crawling to the very top of it Mrs. Ladybug was able to look far out over the face of the pond.  \"Goodness!\" she said to herself. \"I'm glad I'm not out there in a ship.\"  A few moments later she happened to glance down near the shore. And there, to her horror, she beheld a frog.  He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20097"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Ladybug (#5)"],["body"," not a big frog. On the contrary, he was the tiniest frog that Mrs. Ladybug had ever seen. He was sitting on a lily pad, singing with a small, shrill voice, which sounded exactly as if you were tapping two marbles together.  Now, Mrs. Ladybug had all her life stood in great fear of frogs. She didn't dare move, as she gazed at this one with eyes that popped almost out of her head.  He was a brownish person, with a yellow throat which he puffed out like a bag as he sang. And his skin was so rough that Mrs. Ladybug shuddered as she looked at it. Her own was very, very smooth.  All at once the frog looked up and spied Mrs. Ladybug staring at him.  She would have shrieked--had she been able to.  Then Mrs. Ladybug did the thing that she always did whenever she had a great fright. She played dead. She pulled her feet under her body, out of sight, and stuck, motionless, to the grass stalk.  Nothing happened. And she was about to take another sly look at the frog when something moved the stalk of grass. It was only the wind. But Mrs. Ladybug didn't know that. She was sure that the frog had touched it.  Then Mrs. Ladybug played her next trick. She let go of the stalk and dropped to the ground, where she lay upon her side as if she would never move again.  Once more she kept quite still. And since nobody disturbed her, after a time she opened her eyes.  She found herself looking straight into those of the tiny frog, who still sat upon his lily pad in the duck pond.  Mrs. Ladybug shut her eyes instantly. She only hoped that the frog hadn't noticed her action.     XVII  A BRAVE GENTLEMAN   MRS. LADYBUG didn't know that the frog she saw was a very timid fellow. His name was Mr. Cricket Frog. He liked to sit on a lily pad and sing. And his singing sounded a good deal like the music that Chirpy Cricket made. In fact, that was the reason for his odd name.  Mr. Cricket Frog had a trick not unlike the one that Mrs. Ladybug herself played upon him. Whenever a fish, or any other enemy, came near him, if he hadn't time to hide in the mud at the bottom of the pond Mr. Cricket Frog played dead. He would float in the water as if lifeless, until his enemy had gone off about his business.  He was so timid--this Mr. Cricket Frog--that when he saw a stranger he would sometimes play dead. And that was exactly what happened when he caught sight of Mrs. Ladybug as she clung to the grass stalk near the edge of the duck pond and stared at him.  Of course Mrs. Ladybug didn't know all this. When she shut her eyes, and pulled her feet under her body, she wasn't aware that Mr. Cricket Frog was just as alarmed as she was. Having closed her eyes, she couldn't see him jump into the water and float. She couldn't see him climb out upon the lily pad again and gaze at her.  Now, the moment Mrs. Ladybug looked at the frog the second time he took fright anew. Once more he sprang from his seat. Once more he floated like a chip upon the surface of the pond. Once more he crawled back to his seat, after he had made up his mind that the danger had passed.  So they played dead for a long time--both Mrs. Ladybug and Mr. Cricket Frog. And if he hadn't at last made up his mind that she was afraid of him, they might still be trying to fool each other.  \"Pardon me, madam!\" Mr. Cricket Frog called to Mrs. Ladybug. \"I see you're a bit timid. I assure you I shall not harm you.\"  At that Mrs. Ladybug opened her eyes and looked at him. Slowly she thrust her feet out from under her body. And then she tried her wings. They were as good as ever. Her fall had not injured them.  \"You gave me a terrible fright,\" Mrs. Ladybug told him.  Mr. Cricket Frog was very bold now.  \"Why were you afraid of me?\" he asked her. \"Do I look fierce?\" he inquired with a hopeful smile, as if he hoped that he did, but scarcely dared think so.  \"I'm afraid of all frogs,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained. \"Now, there's Ferdinand Frog--\"  \"A rascal!\" Mr. Cricket Frog cried. \"But, madam, I'm not in the least like him. I wouldn't hurt you. In fact, I'd protect you.\"  His words pleased Mrs. Ladybug. She said that thereafter she should always feel safe, with him in the neighborhood.  Mr. Cricket Frog bowed gallantly, with his hand on his heart.  And Mrs. Ladybug went away without guessing that he had himself played dead because he had been in terror of her.  \"What a brave gentleman he is!\" Mrs. Ladybug murmured.     XVIII  A MYSTERY   THERE was one thing that Mrs. Ladybug dreaded more than any other. That was--fire. The slightest whiff of smoke sent her into a flutter of alarm. The sight of a blaze made her almost frantic.  Perhaps Mrs. Ladybug's neighbors--more than she--were to be blamed for her fear. Some of them had an unkind way of frightening her. When they found her a bit too prying with her countless questions about this, that, and the other matter that did not concern her, they said to her:  \"Aren't you worried, Mrs. Ladybug? What if your house were on fire? Wouldn't your children burn?\"  Such questions never failed to send Mrs. Ladybug hurrying away.  After a while people began to wonder where Mrs. Ladybug went when she dashed away like that. Nobody seemed to know where she lived. They supposed that she must fly to her home, wherever it was.  To everybody's surprise, Mrs. Ladybug appeared to want to keep the site of her house a secret from all her friends. When they asked her, point-blank, where her house was, she always pretended not to hear the question and left them. Or she would begin to ask questions of her own choosing, without answering theirs.  \"Humph!\" said some people. \"Mrs. Ladybug likes to pry into our affairs. She wants to know all about our business. And when she learns anything about anybody else she can't rest until she has told it to the whole neighborhood.\"  The more Mrs. Ladybug's friends thought about her house, the harder they tried to discover its whereabouts. Sometimes they even mentioned _fire_ to her and then tried to follow her when she hurried off. But she always managed to give them the slip before she had gone far.  Now and then somebody or other thought he had found Mrs. Ladybug's house. But in the end somebody else was sure to prove that he was mistaken.  Once Freddie Firefly announced with great pride that at last he knew where Mrs. Ladybug was rearing her family.  \"Her house,\" he explained, \"is in a hole in the ground, in the meadow.\"  And that night he led Miss Mehitable Moth to the spot, lighting the way with his flickering gleams.  She soon pointed out his mistake. He had led her to the doorway of the Bumblebee family, who were all sound asleep inside their crowded house.  After that Freddie Firefly had to listen to a good many titters from his friends.  \"The idea!\" they would say. \"Mrs. Ladybug must have a much bigger house than the Bumblebee family's. She couldn't squeeze her children into such small quarters as theirs. Why, she has more children than she can count.\"     XIX  THE DINNER BELL   THERE was great excitement in Farmer Green's orchard. The neighbors came a-flying and a-running and a-crawling from all directions. And little Mrs. Ladybug was the cause of the hurly-burly. She had appeared with a strange, flaring object hanging by a cord from her waist--if she could be said to have a waist. The queer, dangling thing had a handle at its upper end. And when Mrs. Ladybug moved a jingling, jangling sound might have been heard.  In no time at all a crowd had gathered around her. And some of the more curious and ill-bred pointed at whatever it was that puzzled them.  \"What's that?\" they asked Mrs. Ladybug.  Strange to say, she seemed pleased with the stir that she had made.  \"It's a dinner bell,\" she explained.  They gazed at it in wonder, until at last somebody spoke up and demanded, \"What's it for?\"  \"To give the alarm with!\" she replied.  \"What alarm?\" chimed a chorus of voices, high and low.  Mrs. Ladybug smiled an odd sort of smile as she answered, \"The fire alarm, of course! Everybody's always talking _fire_ to me. It makes me frightfully uneasy. There's so little one can do alone in case of fire. But now--\" she added--\"now when anyone says 'Fire!' I'm going to ring this bell with all my might.\"  Well, people didn't know what to say--then. Later, however, they gathered about in groups and talked a good deal about Mrs. Ladybug and her dinner bell.  Miss Moth said that she feared Mrs. Ladybug would disturb her rest if she rang the bell in the daytime, when Miss Moth was accustomed to sleep. Buster Bumblebee hoped Mrs. Ladybug wouldn't ring it at night, because he had a short enough night's sleep as it was, with the family trumpeter waking everybody in the house about dawn. And Freddie Firefly exclaimed that it would be very annoying to him if Mrs. Ladybug gave the alarm of fire whenever she saw his flickering gleams on pleasant evenings in the meadow.  If others were troubled, Mrs. Ladybug herself was much pleased by her dinner bell. She liked to hear it tinkle as she worked. She said it was a cheerful sound and so long as she wore it she never needed to worry about being lost. It was as good as a cowbell for letting the world know one's whereabouts.  There was only one thing that annoyed her. Since she hung the bell from her waist nobody had mentioned _fire_ to her. Nobody had said a word about her children's burning. It seemed as if none of her neighbors wanted her to sound a fire alarm. And if there was anything that would have given her joy, it would have been to seize the handle of her bell and ring it madly.  There were even some people that complained of the tinkle it made among the apple trees.  Peppery Polly Bumblebee laughed at them.  \"You've brought this trouble upon yourselves,\" she told them. \"How can you expect Mrs. Ladybug to keep the tongue of the bell still? She can't even keep her own tongue from wagging!\"  No doubt Peppery Polly knew what she was talking about. She had a very sharp tongue, herself.     XX  FIRE! FIRE!   THE whole countryside "]]]
