With them were foure ladies in gowns, after the fashion of Savoie, of blew velvet, lined with cloath of gold, the velvet all cut, and mantels like tipets knit togither all of silver, and on their heads bonets of burned gold: the foure torch-bearers were in sattin white and blew. This strange apparell pleased much everie person, and in especiall the queene. And thus these foure lords and foure ladies came into the queenes chamber with great light of torches, and dansed a great season, and then put off their visors, and were all well knowne, and then the queene hartily thanked the king's grace for her goodlie pastime and desport.  \"Likewise on the Twelve night, the king and the queene came into the hall at Greenewich, and suddenlie entered a tent of cloath of gold; and before the tent stood foure men of armes, armed at all points, with swords in their hands; and, suddenlie, with noise of trumpets entered foure other persons all armed, and ran to the other foure, and there was a great and fierce fight. And, suddenlie, out of a place like a wood, eight wild men, all apparelled in greene mosse, made with sleved silke, with ouglie weapons, and terrible visages, and there fought with the knights eight to eight: and, after long fighting, the armed knights drove the wild men out of their places, and followed the chase out of the hall, and when they were departed, the tent opened, and there came out six lords and six ladies richlie apparelled, and dansed a great time. When they had dansed their pleasure, they entered the tent againe, which was conveied out of the hall: then the king and queene were served with a right sumptuous banket.\"  In 1515, \"The king kept a solemne Christmasse at his manor of Eltham; and on the Twelfe night, in the hall was made a goodlie castell, wounderously set out: and in it certeine ladies and knights; and when the king and queene were set, in came other knights and assailed the castell, where manie a good stripe was given; and at the last the assailants were beaten awaie. And then issued out knights and ladies out of the castell, which ladies were rich and strangelie disguised; for all their apparell was in braids of gold, fret with moving spangles of silver and gilt, set on crimsin sattin, loose and not fastned; the men's apparell of the same sute made like Julis of Hungarie, and the ladies heads and bodies were after the fashion of Amsterdam. And when the dansing was done, the banket was served in of five hundred dishes, with great plentie to everie bodie.\"  In 1517, \"the king kept his Christmasse at his manor of Greenwich, and on the Twelfe night, according to the old custome, he and the queene came into the hall; and when they were set, and the queene of Scots also, there entered into the hall a garden artificiall, called the garden of _Esperance_. This garden was towred at everie corner, and railed with railes gilt; all the banks were set with flowers artificiall of silke and gold, the leaves cut of green sattin, so that they seemed verie flowers. In the midst of this garden was a piller of antique worke, all gold set with pearles and stones, and on the top of the piller, which was six square, was a lover, or an arch embowed, crowned with gold; within which stood a bush of roses red and white, all of silk and gold, and a bush of pomegranats of the like stuffe. In this garden walked six knights, and six ladies richlie apparelled, and then they descended and dansed manie goodlie danses, and so ascended out of the hall, and then the king was served with a great banket.\"  In 1518 was the fearful plague of the \"sweating sickness,\" and the chronicler says \"this maladie was so cruell that it killed some within three houres, some merrie at dinner, and dead at dinner.\" It even invaded the sanctity of the Court, and the king reduced his _entourage_, and kept no Christmas that year.  In 1520, \"the king kept his Christmas at Greenwich with much noblenesse and open Court. On Twelfe daie his grace and the earle of Devonshire, with foure aids, answered at the tournie all commers, which were sixteene persons. Noble and rich was their apparell, but in feats of armes the king excelled the rest.\"  The next one recorded is that of 1524, when \"before the feast of Christmasse, the lord Leonard Graie, and the lord John Graie, brethren to the Marquesse Dorset, Sir George Cobham, sonne to the lord Cobham, William Carie, Sir John Dudleie, Thomas Wiat, Francis Pointz, Francis Sidneie, Sir Anthonie Browne, Sir Edward Seimor, Oliver Manners, Percivall Hart, Sebastian Nudigate, and Thomas Calen, esquiers of the king's houshold, enterprised a challenge of feats of armes against the feast of Christmas, which was proclaimed by Windsore the herald, and performed at the time appointed after the best manners, both at tilt, tourneie, barriers, and assault of a castell erected for that purpose in the tilt-yard at Greenewich, where the king held a roiall Christmasse that yeare, with great mirth and princelie pastime.\"  Of the next Christ-tide we are told, \"In this winter there was great death in London, so that the terme was adjourned: and the king kept his Christmasse at Eltham, with a small number, and therefore it was called the Still Christmasse.\"  In 1526, \"the king kept a solemne Christmasse at Greenewich with revelles, maskes, disguisings and bankets; and the thirtith daie of December, was an enterprise of iusts made at the tilt by six gentlemen, against all commers, which valiantlie furnished the same, both with speare and sword; and like iustes were kept the third daie of Januarie, where were three hundred speares broken. That same night, the king and manie yoong gentlemen with him, came to Bridewell, and there put him and fifteene other, all in masking apparell, and then tooke his barge and rowed to the cardinal's place, where were at supper a great companie of lords and ladies, and then the maskers dansed, and made goodlie pastime; and when they had well dansed, the ladies plucked awaie their visors, and so they were all knowen, and to the king was made a great banket.\"  This is the last recorded Christ-tide of this reign, and, doubtless, as the king grew older and more sedate, he did not encourage the sports which delighted him in his hot youth.     CHAPTER III       Historic Christ-tides--Edward VI., 1551--Mary--Elizabeth--James      I.--The Puritans--The Pilgrim Fathers--Christmas's      Lamentation--Christ-tide in the Navy, 1625.   Only one is noted in the reign of Edward VI., that of 1551, of which Holinshed writes, \"Wherefore, as well to remove fond talke out of men's mouths, as also to recreat and refresh the troubled spirits of the young king; who seemed to take the trouble of his uncle[5] somewhat heavilie; it was devised, that the feast of Christ's nativitie, commonlie called Christmasse, then at hand, should be solemnlie kept at Greenwich, with open houshold and frank resorte to Court (which is called keeping of the hall), what time of old ordinarie course there is alwaies one appointed to make sport in the Court, called commonlie lord of misrule: whose office is not unknowne to such as have beene brought up in noble men's houses, and among great house-keepers, which use liberall feasting in that season. There was, therefore, by orders of the Councell, a wise gentleman, and learned, named George Ferrers, appointed to that office for this yeare; who, being of better credit and estimation than commonlie his predecessors had beene before, received all his commissions and warrants by the name of the maister of the king's pastimes. Which gentleman so well supplied his office, both in shew of sundrie sights and devises of rare inventions, and in act of diverse interludes, and matters of pastime plaied by persons, as not onely satisfied the common sort, but, also, were very well liked and allowed by the councell, and others of skill in the like pastimes; but, best of all, by the yoong king himselfe, as appeered by his princelie liberalitie in rewarding that service.  [Footnote 5: The Duke of Somerset had just been condemned to death, and was beheaded the 22nd January following.]  \"On mondaie, the fourth of Januarie, the said lord of merie disports came by water to London, and landed at the Tower wharffe, where he was received by Vanse, lord of misrule to John Mainard, one of the shiriffes of London, and so conducted through the citie with a great companie of yoong lords and gentlemen to the house of Sir George Barne, lord maior, where he, with the cheefe of his companie dined, and, after, had a great banket: and at his departure the lord maior gave him a standing cup with a cover of silver and guilt, of the value of ten pounds, for a reward, and also set a hogshed of wine, and a barrell of beere at his gate, for his traine that followed him. The residue of his gentlemen and servants dined at other aldermen's houses, and with the shiriffes, and then departed to the tower wharffe againe, and so to the court by water, to the great commendation of the maior and aldermen, and highlie accepted of the king and councell.\"  Mary does not seem to have kept up state Christ-tide except on one occasion, the year after her marriage with Philip, when a masque was performed before her.  Elizabeth continued the old tradition, but they are only mentioned and known by the Expenses books. It is said that at Christmas 1559 she was displeased with something in the play performed before her, and commanded the players to leave off. There was also a masque for her amusement on Twelfth Night.  Of James I.'s first Christ-tide in England we have the following in a letter from the Lady Arabella Stuart to the Earl of Shrewsbury, 3rd December 1603:--  \"The Queen intendeth to make a mask this Christmass, to which my lady of Suffolk and my lady Walsingham have warrants to take of the late Queen's apparell out of the Tower at their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19979"],["title","A Righte Merrie Christmasse: The Story of Christ-Tide (#5)"],["body",". Certain gentlemen, whom I may not yet name, have made me of theyr counsell, intend another. Certain gentlemen of good sort another. It is said there shall be 30 playes. The king will feast all the Embassadours this Christmass.\"  The death of the infant Princess Mary in September 1607 did not interfere with James I. keeping Christmas right royally in that year. There were masques and theatricals--nay, the king wanted a play acted on Christmas night--and card-playing went on for high sums, the queen losing £300 on the eve of Twelfth night.  It was, probably, the exceeding license of Christ-tide that made the sour Puritans look upon its being kept in remembrance, as vain and superstitious; at all events, whenever in their power, they did their best to crush it. Take, for instance, the first Christmas day after the landing of the so-called \"Pilgrim Fathers\" at Plymouth Rock in 1620, and read the deliberate chilliness and studied slight of the whole affair, which was evidently more than the ship's master could bear.  \"Munday, the 25 Day, we went on shore, some to fell tymber, some to saw, some to riue, and some to carry, so that no man rested all that day, but towards night, some, as they were at worke, heard a noyse of some Indians, which caused vs all to goe to our Muskets, but we heard no further, so we came aboord againe, and left some twentie to keepe the court of gard; that night we had a sore storme of winde and raine. Munday the 25 being Christmas day, we began to drinke water aboord, but at night, the Master caused vs to have some Beere, and so on board we had diverse times now and then some Beere, but on shore none at all.\"  That this working on Christmas day was meant as an intentional slight--for these pious gentlemen would not work on the Sunday--is, I think, made patent by the notice by William Bradford, of how they kept the following Christmas.  \"One ye day called Christmas-day, ye Gov'r caled them out to worke (as was used), but ye most of this new company excused themselves, and said it went against their consciences to worke on ye day. So ye Gov'r tould them that if they made it a mater of conscience, he would spare them till they were better informed. So he led away y^{e} rest, and left them: but when they came home at noone from their worke, he found them in ye streete at play, openly; some pitching ye barr, and some at stoole ball, and such like sports. So he went to them and tooke away their implements, and told them it was against his conscience that they should play, and others worke. If they made ye keeping of it matter of devotion, let them kepe their houses, but there should be no gameing or revelling in ye streets. Since which time nothing hath been attempted that way, at least, openly.\"  But we shall hear more of the Puritans and Christ-tide, only my scheme is to treat the season chronologically, and, consequently, there must be a slight digression; and the following ballad, which must have been published in the time of James I., because of the allusion to yellow starch (Mrs. Turner having been executed for the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury in 1615), gives us       CHRISTMAS'S LAMENTATION       Christmas is my name, far have I gone,        Without regard; without regard.      Whereas great men by flocks there be flown,        To London-ward--to London Ward.      There they in pomp and pleasure do waste      That which Old Christmas was wonted to feast,          Well a day!      Houses where music was wont for to ring,      Nothing but bats and owlets do sing.          Well a day, Well a day.            Well a day, where should I stay?       Christmas beef and bread is turn'd into stones,        Into stones and silken rags;      And Lady Money sleeps and makes moans,        And makes moans in misers' bags;      Houses where pleasures once did abound,      Nought but a dog and a shepherd is found,          Well a day!      Places where Christmas revels did keep,      Now are become habitations for sheep.          Well a day, Well a day,            Well a day, where should I stay?       Pan, the shepherds' god, doth deface,        Doth deface Lady Ceres' crown,      And the tillage doth go to decay,        To decay in every town;      Landlords their rents so highly enhance,      That Pierce, the ploughman, barefoot may dance;          Well a day!      Farmers that Christmas would still entertain,      Scarce have wherewith themselves to maintain,          Well a day, etc.       Come to the countryman, he will protest,        Will protest, and of bull-beef boast;      And, for the citizen, he is so hot,        Is so hot, he will burn the roast.      The courtier, sure good deeds will not scorn,      Nor will he see poor Christmas forlorn?          Well a day!      Since none of these good deeds will do,      Christmas had best turn courtier too,          Well a day, etc.       Pride and luxury they do devour,        Do devour house keeping quite;      And soon beggary they do beget,        Do beget in many a knight.      Madam, forsooth, in her coach must wheel      Although she wear her hose out at heel,          Well a day!      And on her back wear that for a weed,      Which me and all my fellows would feed.          Well a day, etc.       Since pride came up with the yellow starch,        Yellow starch--poor folks do want,      And nothing the rich men will to them give,        To them give, but do them taunt;      For Charity from the country is fled,      And in her place hath nought left but need;          Well a day!      And corn is grown to so high a price,      It makes poor men cry with weeping eyes.          Well a day, etc.       Briefly for to end, here do I find,        I do find so great a vocation,      That most great houses seem to attain,        To attain a strong purgation;      Where purging pills such effects they have shew'd,      That forth of doors they their owners have spued;          Well a day!      And where'er Christmas comes by, and calls,      Nought now but solitary and naked walls.          Well a day, etc.       Philemon's cottage was turn'd into gold,        Into gold, for harbouring Jove:      Rich men their houses up for to keep,        For to keep, might their greatness move;      But, in the city, they say, they do live,      Where gold by handfulls away they do give;--          I'll away,      And thither, therefore, I purpose to pass,      Hoping at London to find the Golden Ass.          I'll away, I'll away,            I'll away, for here's no stay.  A little light upon this ballad may possibly be found in a letter from John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton (21st December 1627):--\"Divers lords and personages of quality have made means to be dispensed withall for going into the Country this Christmas according to the proclamation; but it will not be granted, so that they pack away on all sides for fear of the worst.\"  As we are now getting near the attempted suppression of Christmas under the Puritan _régime_, it may be as well to notice the extreme licence to which the season's holiday and festivities had reached--and perhaps a more flagrant case than the following can scarcely be given. On 13th January 1626 the Commissioners of the Navy write to the Duke of Buckingham that they have received information from persons who have been on board the _Happy Entrance_ in the Downs, and the _Nonsuch_ and _Garland_ at Gore-end, that for these Christmas holidays, the captains, masters, boatswains, gunners, and carpenters, were not aboard their ships, nor gave any attendance to the service, leaving the ships a prey to any who might have assaulted them. The Commissioners sent down clothes for the sailors, and there were no officers to take charge of them, and the pressed men ran away as fast as the Commissioners sent them down. If they had beaten up and down, they might have prevented the loss of two English ships taken by the Dunkirkers off Yarmouth.  This, naturally, was a state of things which could not be allowed, and on January 15 the Duke of Buckingham wrote to Sir Henry Palmer as to the officers and men quitting their ships at Christmas time, and called upon him \"presently to repair on board his own ship, and to charge the officers of all the ships composing his fleet, not to depart from their ships without order.\"     CHAPTER IV       Attempts of Puritans to put down Christ-tide--Attitude of      the people--Preaching before Parliament--\"The Arraignment,      etc., of Christmas.\"   As soon as the Puritans became at all powerful, their iconoclastic zeal naturally attacked Christmas, and the Scotchmen, such as Baillie, Rutherford, Gillespie, and Henderson, in the Westminster Assembly of Divines, tried in 1643 to get the English observance of Christmas abolished--but they only succeeded so far as coming to a resolution that whilst preaching on that day, \"withal to cry down the superstition of that day.\" Next year they were happier in their efforts, as is shortly told in _Parliamentary History_, December 19, 1644. \"The lords and commons having long since appointed a day for a Fast and Humiliation, which was to be on the last Wednesday in every Month, it happening to fall on Christmas day this month, the Assembly of Divine sent to acquaint the lords with it: and, to avoid any inconveniences that might be by some people keeping it as a Feast, and others as a Fast, they desired that the Parliament would publish a Declaration the next Lord's day in the Churches of London and Westminster; that that day might be kept as it ought to be, that the whole kingdom might have comfort thereby. The houses agreed to this proposal, and directed the following Ordinance to be published; which bore this title--  \"AN ORDINANCE FOR THE BETTER OBSERVATION OF THE FEAST OF THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST.  \"Whereas some doubts have been raised whether the next Fast shall be celebrated, because it falleth on the day which, heretofore, was usually called the Feast of the"]]]
