I made one mistake--that of fear--and in committing one error, I shouldered every blame.  It makes little difference now. I am dead--and free.  My love to you, my son.  I hope that wealth and happiness await you. Blood of my blood flows in your veins--and strange though it may sound to you--it is the blood of an adventurer.  I can almost see you smile at that!  An old man who sat by the window, staring out; afraid of every knock at the door--and yet an adventurer!  But they say, once in the blood, it never dies.  My wish is that you succeed where I failed--and God be with you!  Your father.   For a long moment Robert Fairchild stood staring at the letter, his heart pounding with excitement, his hands grasping the foolscap paper as though with a desire to tear through the shield which the written words had formed about a mysterious past and disclose that which was so effectively hidden.  So much had the letter told--and yet so little! Dark had been the hints of some mysterious, intangible thing, great enough in its horror and its far-reaching consequences to cause death for one who had known of it and a living panic for him who had perpetrated it.  As for the man who stood now with the letter clenched before him, there was promise of wealth, and the threat of sorrow, the hope of happiness, yet the foreboding omen of discoveries which might ruin the life of the reader as the existence of the writer had been blasted,--until death had brought relief.  Of all this had the letter told, but when Robert Fairchild read it again in the hope of something tangible, something that might give even a clue to the reason for it all, there was nothing.  In that super-calmness which accompanies great agitation, Fairchild folded the paper, placed it in its envelope, then slipped it into an inside pocket.  A few steps and he was before the safe once more and reaching for the second envelope.  Heavy and bulky was this, filled with tax receipts, with plats and blueprints and the reports of surveyors.  Here was an assay slip, bearing figures and notations which Robert Fairchild could not understand.  Here a receipt for money received, here a vari-colored map with lines and figures and conglomerate designs which Fairchild believed must relate in some manner to the location of a mining camp; all were aged and worn at the edges, giving evidence of having been carried, at some far time of the past, in a wallet.  More receipts, more blueprints, then a legal document, sealed and stamped, and bearing the words:     County of Clear Creek,  )  ss.   State of Colorado.      )  DEED PATENT.  KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That on this day of our Lord, February 22, 1892, Thornton W. Fairchild, having presented the necessary affidavits and statements of assessments accomplished in accordance with--   On it trailed in endless legal phraseology, telling in muddled, attorney-like language, the fact that the law had been fulfilled in its requirements, and that the claim for which Thornton Fairchild had worked was rightfully his, forever.  A longer statement full of figures, of diagrams and surveyor's calculations which Fairchild could neither decipher nor understand, gave the location, the town site and the property included within the granted rights.  It was something for an attorney, such as Beamish, to interpret, and Fairchild reached for the age-yellowed envelope to return the papers to their resting place. But he checked his motion involuntarily and for a moment held the envelope before him, staring at it with wide eyes.  Then, as though to free by the stronger light of the window the haunting thing which faced him, he rose and hurried across the room, to better light, only to find it had not been imagination; the words still were before him, a sentence written in faint, faded ink proclaiming the contents to be \"Papers relating to the Blue Poppy Mine\", and written across this a word in the bolder, harsher strokes of a man under stress of emotion, a word which held the eyes of Robert Fairchild fixed and staring, a word which spelled books of the past and evil threats of the future, the single, ominous word:  \"Accursed!\"     CHAPTER II  One works quickly when prodded by the pique of curiosity.  And in spite of all that omens could foretell, in spite of the dull, gloomy life which had done its best to fashion a matter-of-fact brain for Robert Fairchild, one sentence in that letter had found an echo, had started a pulsating something within him that he never before had known:  \"--It is the blood of an adventurer.\"  And it seemed that Robert Fairchild needed no more than the knowledge to feel the tingle of it; the old house suddenly became stuffy and prison-like as he wandered through it.  Within his pocket were two envelopes filled with threats of the future, defying him to advance and fight it out,--whatever _it_ might be.  Again and again pounded through his head the fact that only a night of travel intervened between Indianapolis and St. Louis; within twelve hours he could be in the office of Henry Beamish.  And then--  A hurried resolution.  A hasty packing of a traveling bag and the cashing of a check at the cigar store down on the corner.  A wakeful night while the train clattered along upon its journey.  Then morning and walking of streets until office hours.  At last:  \"I 'm Robert Fairchild,\" he said, as he faced a white-haired, Cupid-faced man in the rather dingy offices of the Princess Building. A slow smile spread over the pudgy features of the genial appearing attorney, and he waved a fat hand toward the office's extra chair.  \"Sit down, Son,\" came casually.  \"Need n't have announced yourself.  I 'd have known you--just like your father, Boy.  How is he?\"  Then his face suddenly sobered.  \"I 'm afraid your presence is the answer.  Am I right?\"  Fairchild nodded gravely.  The old attorney slowly placed his fat hands together, peaking the fingers, and stared out of the window to the grimy roof and signboards of the next building.  \"Perhaps it's better so,\" he said at last.  \"We had n't seen each other in ten years--not since I went up to Indianapolis to have my last talk with him.  Did he get any cheerier before--he went?\"  \"No.\"  \"Just the same, huh?  Always waiting?\"  \"Afraid of every step on the veranda, of every knock at the door.\"  Again the attorney stared out of the window.  \"And you?\"  \"I?\"  Fairchild leaned forward in his chair.  \"I don't understand.\"  \"Are you afraid?\"  \"Of what?\"  The lawyer smiled.  \"I don't know.  Only--\" and he leaned forward--\"it's just as though I were living my younger days over this morning.  It doesn't seem any time at all since your father was sitting just about where you are now, and gad, Boy, how much you look like he looked that morning!  The same gray-blue, earnest eyes, the same dark hair, the same strong shoulders, and good, manly chin, the same build--and look of determination about him.  The call of adventure was in his blood, and he sat there all enthusiastic, telling me what he intended doing and asking my advice--although he would n't have followed it if I had given it.  Back home was a baby and the woman he loved, and out West was sudden wealth, waiting for the right man to come along and find it.  Gad!\" White-haired old Beamish chuckled with the memory of it.  \"He almost made me throw over the law business that morning and go out adventuring with him!  Then four years later,\" the tone changed suddenly, \"he came back.\"  \"What then?\"  Fairchild was on the edge of his chair.  But Beamish only spread his hands.  \"Truthfully, Boy, I don't know.  I have guessed--but I won't tell you what.  All I know is that your father found what he was looking for and was on the point of achieving his every dream, when something happened. Then three men simply disappeared from the mining camp, announcing that they had failed and were going to hunt new diggings.  That was all. One of them was your father--\"  \"But you said that he 'd found--\"  \"Silver, running twenty ounces to the ton on an eight-inch vein which gave evidences of being only the beginning of a bonanza!  I know, because he had written me that, a month before.\"  \"And he abandoned it?\"  \"He 'd forgotten what he had written when I saw him again.  I did n't question him.  I did n't want to--his face told me enough to guess that I would n't learn.  He went home then, after giving me enough money to pay the taxes on the mine for the next twenty years, simply as his attorney and without divulging his whereabouts.  I did it.  Eight years or so later, I saw him in Indianapolis.  He gave me more money--enough for eleven or twelve years--\"  \"And that was ten years ago?\" Robert Fairchild's eyes were reminiscent. \"I remember--I was only a kid.  He sold off everything he had, except the house.\"  Henry Beamish walked to his safe and fumbled there a moment, to return at last with a few slips of paper.  \"Here 's the answer,\" he said quietly, \"the taxes are paid until 1922.\"  Robert Fairchild studied the receipts carefully--futilely.  They told him nothing.  The lawyer stood looking down upon him; at last he laid a hand on his shoulder.  \"Boy,\" came quietly, \"I know just about what you 're thinking.  I 've spent a few hours at the same kind of a job myself, and I 've called old Henry Beamish more kinds of a fool than you can think of for not coming right out flat-footed and making Thornton tell me the whole story.  But some way, when I 'd look into those eyes with the fire all dead and ashen within them, and see the lines of an old man in his young face, I--well, I guess I 'm too soft-hearted to make folks suffer.  I just couldn't do it!\"  \"So you can tell me nothing?\"  \"I 'm afraid that's true--in one way.  In another I 'm a fund of information.  To-night you and I will go to Indianapolis and probate the will--it's simple enough; I 've had it in my safe for ten years. After that, you become the owner of the Blue Poppy mine, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20104"],["title","The Cross-Cut (#2)"],["body"," with as you choose.\"  \"But--\"  The old lawyer chuckled.  \"Don't ask my advice, Boy.  I have n't any.  Your father told me what to do if you decided to try your luck--and silver 's at $1.29.  It means a lot of money for anybody who can produce pay ore--unless what he said about the mine pinching out was true.\"  Again the thrill of a new thing went through Robert Fairchild's veins, something he never had felt until twelve hours before; again the urge for strange places, new scenes, the fire of the hunt after the hidden wealth of silver-seamed hills.  Somewhere it lay awaiting him; nor did he even know in what form.  Robert Fairchild's life had been a plodding thing of books and accounts, of high desks which as yet had failed to stoop his shoulders, of stuffy offices which had been thwarted so far in their grip at his lung power; the long walk in the morning and the tired trudge homeward at night to save petty carfare for a silent man's pettier luxuries had looked after that.  But the recoil had not exerted itself against an office-cramped brain, a dusty ledger-filled life that suddenly felt itself crying out for the free, open country, without hardly knowing what the term meant.  Old Beamish caught the light in the eyes, the quick contraction of the hands, and smiled.  \"You don't need to tell me, Son,\" he said slowly.  \"I can see the symptoms.  You 've got the fever--You 're going to work that mine. Perhaps,\" and he shrugged his shoulders, \"it's just as well.  But there are certain things to remember.\"  \"Name them.\"  \"Ohadi is thirty-eight miles from Denver.  That's your goal.  Out there, they 'll tell you how the mine caved in, and how Thornton Fairchild, who had worked it, together with his two men, Harry Harkins, a Cornishman, and 'Sissie' Larsen, a Swede, left town late one night for Cripple Creek--and that they never came back.  That's the story they 'll tell you.  Agree with it.  Tell them that Harkins, as far as you know, went back to Cornwall, and that you have heard vaguely that Larsen later followed the mining game farther out West.\"  \"Is it the truth?\"  \"How do I know?  It 's good enough--people should n't ask questions. Tell nothing more than that--and be careful of your friends.  There is one man to watch--if he is still alive.  They call him 'Squint' Rodaine, and he may or may not still be there.  I don't know--I 'm only sure of the fact that your father hated him, fought him and feared him. The mine tunnel is two miles up Kentucky Gulch and one hundred yards to the right.  A surveyor can lead you to the very spot.  It's been abandoned now for thirty years.  What you 'll find there is more than I can guess.  But, Boy,\" and his hand clenched tight on Robert Fairchild's shoulder, \"whatever you do, whatever you run into, whatever friends or enemies you find awaiting you, don't let that light die out of your eyes and don't pull in that chin!  If you find a fight on your hands, whether it's man, beast or nature, sail into it!  If you run into things that cut your very heart out to learn--beat 'em down and keep going!  And win!  There--that's all the advice I know.  Meet me at the 11:10 train for Indianapolis.  Good-by.\"  \"Good-by--I 'll be there.\"  Fairchild grasped the pudgy hand and left the office.  For a moment afterward, old Henry Beamish stood thinking and looking out over the dingy roof adjacent.  Then, somewhat absently, he pressed the ancient electric button for his more ancient stenographer.  \"Call a messenger, please,\" he ordered when she entered, \"I want to send a cablegram.\"     CHAPTER III  Two weeks later, Robert Fairchild sat in the smoking compartment of the Overland Limited, looking at the Rocky Mountains in the distance.  In his pocket were a few hundred dollars; in the bank in Indianapolis a few thousand, representing the final proceeds of the sale of everything that had connected him with a rather dreary past.  Out before him--  The train had left Limon Junction on its last, clattering, rushing leg of the journey across the plains, tearing on through a barren country of tumbleweed, of sagebrush, of prairie-dog villages and jagged arroyos toward the great, crumpled hills in the distance,--hills which meant everything to Robert Fairchild.  Two weeks had created a metamorphosis in what had been a plodding, matter-of-fact man with dreams which did not extend beyond his ledgers and his gloomy home--but now a man leaning his head against the window of a rushing train, staring ahead toward the Rockies and the rainbow they held for him.  Back to the place where his father had gone with dreams aglow was the son traveling now,--back into the rumpled mountains where the blue haze hung low and protecting as though over mysteries and treasures which awaited one man and one alone.  Robert Fairchild momentarily had forgotten the foreboding omens which, like murky shadows, had been cast in his path by a beaten, will-broken father.  He only knew that he was young, that he was strong, that he was free from the drudgery which had sought to claim him forever; he felt only the surge of excitement that can come with new surroundings, new country, new life.  Out there before him, as the train rattled over culverts spanning the dry arroyos, or puffed gingerly up the grades toward the higher levels of the plains, were the hills, gray and brown in the foreground, blue as the blue sea farther on, then fringing into the sun-pinked radiance of the snowy range, forming the last barrier against a turquoise sky.  It thrilled Fairchild, it caused his heart to tug and pull,--nor could he tell exactly why.  Still eighty miles away, the range was sharply outlined to Fairchild, from the ragged hump of Pikes Peak far to the south, on up to where the gradual lowering of the mighty upheaval slid away into Wyoming.  Eighty miles, yet they were clear with the clearness that only altitudinous country can bring; alluring, fascinating, beckoning to him until his being rebelled against the comparative slowness of the train, and the minutes passed in a dragging, long-drawn-out sequence that was almost an agony to Robert Fairchild.  Hours!  The hills came closer.  Still closer; then, when it seemed that the train must plunge straight into them, they drew away again, as though through some optical illusion, and brooded in the background, as the long, transcontinental train began to bang over the frogs and switches as it made its entrance into Denver.  Fairchild went through the long chute and to a ticket window of the Union Station.  \"When can I get a train for Ohadi?\"  The ticket seller smiled.  \"You can't get one.\"  \"But the map shows that a railroad runs there--\"  \"Ran there, you mean,\" chaffed the clerk.  \"The best you can do is get to Forks Creek and walk the rest of the way.  That's a narrow-gauge line, and Clear Creek 's been on a rampage. It took out about two hundred feet of trestle, and there won't be a train into Ohadi for a week.\"  The disappointment on Fairchild's face was more than apparent, almost boyish in its depression.  The ticket seller leaned closer to the wicket.  \"Stranger out here?\"  \"Very much of one.\"  \"In a hurry to get to Ohadi?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you can go uptown and hire a taxi--they 've got big cars for mountain work and there are good roads all the way.  It 'll cost fifteen or twenty dollars.  Or--\"  Fairchild smiled.  \"Give me the other system if you 've got one.  I 'm not terribly long on cash--for taxis.\"  \"Certainly.  I was just going to tell you about it.  No use spending that money if you 've got a little pep, and it is n't a matter of life or death.  Go up to the Central Loop--anybody can direct you--and catch a street car for Golden.  That eats up fifteen miles and leaves just twenty-three miles more.  Then ask somebody to point out the road over Mount Lookout.  Machines go along there every few minutes--no trouble at all to catch a ride.  You 'll be in Ohadi in no time.\"  Fairchild obeyed the instructions, and in the baggage room rechecked his trunk to follow him, lightening his traveling bag at the same time until it carried only necessities.  A luncheon, then the street car. Three quarters of an hour later, he began the five-mile trudge up the broad, smooth, carefully groomed automobile highway which masters Mount Lookout.  A rumbling sound behind him, then as he stepped to one side, a grimy truck driver leaned out to shout as he passed:  \"Want a lift?  Hop on!  Can't stop--too much grade.\"  A running leap, and Fairchild seated himself on the tailboard of the truck, swinging his legs and looking out over the fading plains as the truck roared and clattered upward along the twisting mountain road.  Higher, higher, while the truck labored along the grade, and while the buildings in Golden below shrank smaller and smaller.  The reservoir lake in the center of the town, a broad expanse of water only a short time before, began to take on the appearance of some great, blue-white diamond glistening in the sun.  Gradually a stream outlined itself in living topography upon a map which seemed as large as the world itself. Denver, fifteen miles away, came into view, its streets showing like seams in a well-sewn garment, the sun, even at this distance, striking a sheen from the golden dome of the capitol building.  Higher!  The chortling truck gasped at the curves and tugged on the straightaway, but Robert Fairchild had ceased to hear.  His every attention was centered on the tremendous stage unfolded before him, the vast stretches of the plains rolling away beneath, even into Kansas and Wyoming and Nebraska, hundreds of miles away, plains where once the buffalo had roamed in great, shaggy herds, where once the emigrant trains had made their slow, rocking progress into a Land of Heart's Desire; and he began to understand something of the vastness of life, the great scope of ambition; new things to a man whose world, until two weeks before, had been the four chalky walls of an office.
