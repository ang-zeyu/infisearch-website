She, somewhat over gentle and discreet,   Insisted that the thing should be concealed;   But I will not condone such shamelessness,   Nor so far wrong you as to keep it secret.    ELMIRE   Yes, I believe a wife should never trouble   Her husband's peace of mind with such vain gossip;   A woman's honour does not hang on telling;   It is enough if she defend herself;   Or so I think; Damis, you'd not have spoken,   If you would but have heeded my advice.      SCENE VI    ORGON, DAMIS, TARTUFFE     ORGON   Just Heaven! Can what I hear be credited?    TARTUFFE   Yes, brother, I am wicked, I am guilty,   A miserable sinner, steeped in evil,   The greatest criminal that ever lived.   Each moment of my life is stained with soilures;   And all is but a mass of crime and filth;   Heaven, for my punishment, I see it plainly,   Would mortify me now. Whatever wrong   They find to charge me with, I'll not deny it   But guard against the pride of self-defence.   Believe their stories, arm your wrath against me,   And drive me like a villain from your house;   I cannot have so great a share of shame   But what I have deserved a greater still.    ORGON (to his son)   You miscreant, can you dare, with such a falsehood,   To try to stain the whiteness of his virtue?    DAMIS   What! The feigned meekness of this hypocrite   Makes you discredit ...    ORGON   Silence, cursed plague!    TARTUFFE   Ah! Let him speak; you chide him wrongfully;   You'd do far better to believe his tales.   Why favour me so much in such a matter?   How can you know of what I'm capable?   And should you trust my outward semblance, brother,   Or judge therefrom that I'm the better man?   No, no; you let appearances deceive you;   I'm anything but what I'm thought to be,   Alas! and though all men believe me godly,   The simple truth is, I'm a worthless creature.    (To Damis)   Yes, my dear son, say on, and call me traitor,   Abandoned scoundrel, thief, and murderer;   Heap on me names yet more detestable,   And I shall not gainsay you; I've deserved them;   I'll bear this ignominy on my knees,   To expiate in shame the crimes I've done.    ORGON (to Tartuffe)   Ah, brother, 'tis too much!    (To his son)   You'll not relent,   You blackguard?    DAMIS   What! His talk can so deceive you ...    ORGON   Silence, you scoundrel!    (To Tartuffe)   Brother, rise, I beg you.    (To his son)   Infamous villain!    DAMIS   Can he ...    ORGON   Silence!    DAMIS   What ...    ORGON   Another word, I'll break your every bone.    TARTUFFE   Brother, in God's name, don't be angry with him!   I'd rather bear myself the bitterest torture   Than have him get a scratch on my account.    ORGON (to his son)   Ungrateful monster!    TARTUFFE   Stop. Upon my knees   I beg you pardon him ...    ORGON (throwing himself on his knees too, and embracing Tartuffe)   Alas! How can you?    (To his son)   Villain! Behold his goodness!    DAMIS   So ...    ORGON   Be still.    DAMIS   What! I ...    ORGON   Be still, I say. I know your motives   For this attack. You hate him, all of you;   Wife, children, servants, all let loose upon him,   You have recourse to every shameful trick   To drive this godly man out of my house;   The more you strive to rid yourselves of him,   The more I'll strive to make him stay with me;   I'll have him straightway married to my daughter,   Just to confound the pride of all of you.    DAMIS   What! Will you force her to accept his hand?    ORGON   Yes, and this very evening, to enrage you,   Young rascal! Ah! I'll brave you all, and show you   That I'm the master, and must be obeyed.   Now, down upon your knees this instant, rogue,   And take back what you said, and ask his pardon.    DAMIS   Who? I? Ask pardon of that cheating scoundrel ... ?    ORGON   Do you resist, you beggar, and insult him?   A cudgel, here! a cudgel!    (To Tartuffe)   Don't restrain me.    (To his son)   Off with you! Leave my house this instant, sirrah,   And never dare set foot in it again.    DAMIS   Yes, I will leave your house, but ...    ORGON   Leave it quickly.   You reprobate, I disinherit you,   And give you, too, my curse into the bargain.      SCENE VII    ORGON, TARTUFFE     ORGON   What! So insult a saintly man of God!    TARTUFFE   Heaven, forgive him all the pain he gives me! [4]    [Footnote 4: Some modern editions have adopted the reading, preserved   by tradition as that of the earliest stage version: Heaven, forgive   him even as I forgive him! Voltaire gives still another reading:   Heaven, forgive me even as I forgive him! Whichever was the original   version, it appears in none of the early editions, and Moliere   probably felt forced to change it on account of its too close   resemblance to the Biblical phrase.]    (To Orgon)   Could you but know with what distress I see   Them try to vilify me to my brother!    ORGON   Ah!    TARTUFFE   The mere thought of such ingratitude   Makes my soul suffer torture, bitterly ...   My horror at it ... Ah! my heart's so full   I cannot speak ... I think I'll die of it.    ORGON (in tears, running to the door through which he drove away his   son)   Scoundrel! I wish I'd never let you go,   But slain you on the spot with my own hand.    (To Tartuffe)   Brother, compose yourself, and don't be angry.    TARTUFFE   Nay, brother, let us end these painful quarrels.   I see what troublous times I bring upon you,   And think 'tis needful that I leave this house.    ORGON   What! You can't mean it?    TARTUFFE   Yes, they hate me here,   And try, I find, to make you doubt my faith.    ORGON   What of it? Do you find I listen to them?    TARTUFFE   No doubt they won't stop there. These same reports   You now reject, may some day win a hearing.    ORGON   No, brother, never.    TARTUFFE   Ah! my friend, a woman   May easily mislead her husband's mind.    ORGON   No, no.    TARTUFFE   So let me quickly go away   And thus remove all cause for such attacks.    ORGON   No, you shall stay; my life depends upon it.    TARTUFFE   Then I must mortify myself. And yet,   If you should wish ...    ORGON   No, never!    TARTUFFE   Very well, then;   No more of that. But I shall rule my conduct   To fit the case. Honour is delicate,   And friendship binds me to forestall suspicion,   Prevent all scandal, and avoid your wife.    ORGON   No, you shall haunt her, just to spite them all.   'Tis my delight to set them in a rage;   You shall be seen together at all hours   And what is more, the better to defy them,   I'll have no other heir but you; and straightway   I'll go and make a deed of gift to you,   Drawn in due form, of all my property.   A good true friend, my son-in-law to be,   Is more to me than son, and wife, and kindred.   You will accept my offer, will you not?    TARTUFFE   Heaven's will be done in everything!    ORGON   Poor man!   We'll go make haste to draw the deed aright,   And then let envy burst itself with spite!       ACT IV      SCENE I    CLEANTE, TARTUFFE     CLEANTE   Yes, it's become the talk of all the town,   And make a stir that's scarcely to your credit;   And I have met you, sir, most opportunely,   To tell you in a word my frank opinion.   Not to sift out this scandal to the bottom,   Suppose the worst for us--suppose Damis   Acted the traitor, and accused you falsely;   Should not a Christian pardon this offence,   And stifle in his heart all wish for vengeance?   Should you permit that, for your petty quarrel,   A son be driven from his father's house?   I tell you yet again, and tell you frankly,   Everyone, high or low, is scandalised;   If you'll take my advice, you'll make it up,   And not push matters to extremities.   Make sacrifice to God of your resentment;   Restore the son to favour with his father.    TARTUFFE   Alas! So far as I'm concerned, how gladly   Would I do so! I bear him no ill will;   I pardon all, lay nothing to his charge,   And wish with all my heart that I might serve him;   But Heaven's interests cannot allow it;   If he returns, then I must leave the house.   After his conduct, quite unparalleled,   All intercourse between us would bring scandal;   God knows what everyone's first thought would be!   They would attribute it to merest scheming   On my part--say that conscious of my guilt   I feigned a Christian love for my accuser,   But feared him in my heart, and hoped to win him   And underhandedly secure his silence.    CLEANTE   You try to put us off with specious phrases;   But all your arguments are too far-fetched.   Why take upon yourself the cause of Heaven?   Does Heaven need our help to punish sinners?   Leave to itself the care of its own vengeance,   And keep in mind the pardon it commands us;   Besides, think somewhat less of men's opinions,   When you are following the will of Heaven.   Shall petty fear of what the world may think   Prevent the doing of a noble deed?   No!--let us always do as Heaven commands,   And not perplex our brains with further questions.    TARTUFFE   Already I have told you I forgive him;   And that is doing, sir, as Heaven commands.   But after this day's scandal and affront   Heaven does not order me to live with him.    CLEANTE   And does it order you to lend your ear   To what mere whim suggested to his father,   And to accept gift of his estates,   On which, in justice, you can make no claim?    TARTUFFE   No one who knows me, sir, can have the thought   That I am acting from a selfish motive.   The goods of this world have no charms for me;   I am not dazzled by their treacherous glamour;   And if I bring myself to take the gift   Which he insists on giving me, I do so,   To tell the truth, only because I fear   This whole estate may fall into bad hands,   And those to whom it comes may use it ill   And not employ it, as is my design,   For Heaven's glory and my neighbours' good.    CLEANTE   Eh, sir, give up these conscientious scruples   That well may cause a rightful heir's complaints.   Don't take so much upon yourself,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2027"],["title","Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite (#7)"],["body"," but let him   Possess what's his, at his own risk and peril;   Consider, it were better he misused it,   Than you should be accused of robbing him.   I am astounded that unblushingly   You could allow such offers to be made!   Tell me--has true religion any maxim   That teaches us to rob the lawful heir?   If Heaven has made it quite impossible   Damis and you should live together here,   Were it not better you should quietly   And honourably withdraw, than let the son   Be driven out for your sake, dead against   All reason? 'Twould be giving, sir, believe me,   Such an example of your probity ...    TARTUFFE   Sir, it is half-past three; certain devotions   Recall me to my closet; you'll forgive me   For leaving you so soon.    CLEANTE (alone)   Ah!      SCENE II    ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, DORINE     DORINE (to Cleante)   Sir, we beg you   To help us all you can in her behalf;   She's suffering almost more than heart can bear;   This match her father means to make to-night   Drives her each moment to despair. He's coming.   Let us unite our efforts now, we beg you,   And try by strength or skill to change his purpose.      SCENE III    ORGON, ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, DORINE     ORGON   So ho! I'm glad to find you all together.    (To Mariane)   Here is the contract that shall make you happy,   My dear. You know already what it means.    MARIANE (on her knees before Orgon)   Father, I beg you, in the name of Heaven   That knows my grief, and by whate'er can move you,   Relax a little your paternal rights,   And free my love from this obedience!   Oh, do not make me, by your harsh command,   Complain to Heaven you ever were my father;   Do not make wretched this poor life you gave me.   If, crossing that fond hope which I had formed,   You'll not permit me to belong to one   Whom I have dared to love, at least, I beg you   Upon my knees, oh, save me from the torment   Of being possessed by one whom I abhor!   And do not drive me to some desperate act   By exercising all your rights upon me.    ORGON (a little touched)   Come, come, my heart, be firm! no human weakness!    MARIANE   I am not jealous of your love for him;   Display it freely; give him your estate,   And if that's not enough, add all of mine;   I willingly agree, and give it up,   If only you'll not give him me, your daughter;   Oh, rather let a convent's rigid rule   Wear out the wretched days that Heaven allots me.    ORGON   These girls are ninnies!--always turning nuns   When fathers thwart their silly love-affairs.   Get on your feet! The more you hate to have him,   The more 'twill help you earn your soul's salvation.   So, mortify your senses by this marriage,   And don't vex me about it any more.    DORINE   But what ... ?    ORGON   You hold your tongue, before your betters.   Don't dare to say a single word, I tell you.    CLEANTE   If you will let me answer, and advise ...    ORGON   Brother, I value your advice most highly;   'Tis well thought out; no better can be had;   But you'll allow me--not to follow it.    ELMIRE (to her husband)   I can't find words to cope with such a case;   Your blindness makes me quite astounded at you.   You are bewitched with him, to disbelieve   The things we tell you happened here to-day.    ORGON   I am your humble servant, and can see   Things, when they're plain as noses on folks' faces,   I know you're partial to my rascal son,   And didn't dare to disavow the trick   He tried to play on this poor man; besides,   You were too calm, to be believed; if that   Had happened, you'd have been far more disturbed.    ELMIRE   And must our honour always rush to arms   At the mere mention of illicit love?   Or can we answer no attack upon it   Except with blazing eyes and lips of scorn?   For my part, I just laugh away such nonsense;   I've no desire to make a loud to-do.   Our virtue should, I think, be gentle-natured;   Nor can I quite approve those savage prudes   Whose honour arms itself with teeth and claws   To tear men's eyes out at the slightest word.   Heaven preserve me from that kind of honour!   I like my virtue not to be a vixen,   And I believe a quiet cold rebuff   No less effective to repulse a lover.    ORGON   I know ... and you can't throw me off the scent.    ELMIRE   Once more, I am astounded at your weakness;   I wonder what your unbelief would answer,   If I should let you see we've told the truth?    ORGON   See it?    ELMIRE   Yes.    ORGON   Nonsense.    ELMIRE   Come! If I should find   A way to make you see it clear as day?    ORGON   All rubbish.    ELMIRE   What a man! But answer me.   I'm not proposing now that you believe us;   But let's suppose that here, from proper hiding,   You should be made to see and hear all plainly;   What would you say then, to your man of virtue?    ORGON   Why, then, I'd say ... say nothing. It can't be.    ELMIRE   Your error has endured too long already,   And quite too long you've branded me a liar.   I must at once, for my own satisfaction,   Make you a witness of the things we've told you.    ORGON   Amen! I take you at your word. We'll see   What tricks you have, and how you'll keep your promise.    ELMIRE (to Dorine)   Send him to me.    DORINE (to Elmire)   The man's a crafty codger,   Perhaps you'll find it difficult to catch him.    ELMIRE (to Dorine)   Oh no! A lover's never hard to cheat,   And self-conceit leads straight to self-deceit.   Bid him come down to me.    (To Cleante and Mariane)   And you, withdraw.      SCENE IV    ELMIRE, ORGON     ELMIRE   Bring up this table, and get under it.    ORGON   What?    ELMIRE   One essential is to hide you well.    ORGON   Why under there?    ELMIRE   Oh, dear! Do as I say;   I know what I'm about, as you shall see.   Get under, now, I tell you; and once there   Be careful no one either sees or hears you.    ORGON   I'm going a long way to humour you,   I must say; but I'll see you through your scheme.    ELMIRE   And then you'll have, I think, no more to say.    (To her husband, who is now under the table.)   But mind, I'm going to meddle with strange matters;   Prepare yourself to be in no wise shocked.   Whatever I may say must pass, because   'Tis only to convince you, as I promised.   By wheedling speeches, since I'm forced to do it,   I'll make this hypocrite put off his mask,   Flatter the longings of his shameless passion,   And give free play to all his impudence.   But, since 'tis for your sake, to prove to you   His guilt, that I shall feign to share his love,   I can leave off as soon as you're convinced,   And things shall go no farther than you choose.   So, when you think they've gone quite far enough,   It is for you to stop his mad pursuit,   To spare your wife, and not expose me farther   Than you shall need, yourself, to undeceive you.   It is your own affair, and you must end it   When ... Here he comes. Keep still, don't show yourself.      SCENE V    TARTUFFE, ELMIRE; ORGON (under the table)     TARTUFFE   They told me that you wished to see me here.    ELMIRE   Yes. I have secrets for your ear alone.   But shut the door first, and look everywhere   For fear of spies.    (Tartuffe goes and closes the door, and comes back.)   We surely can't afford   Another scene like that we had just now;   Was ever anyone so caught before!   Damis did frighten me most terribly   On your account; you saw I did my best   To baffle his design, and calm his anger.   But I was so confused, I never thought   To contradict his story; still, thank Heaven,   Things turned out all the better, as it happened,   And now we're on an even safer footing.   The high esteem you're held in, laid the storm;   My husband can have no suspicion of you,   And even insists, to spite the scandal-mongers,   That we shall be together constantly;   So that is how, without the risk of blame,   I can be here locked up with you alone,   And can reveal to you my heart, perhaps   Only too ready to allow your passion.    TARTUFFE   Your words are somewhat hard to understand,   Madam; just now you used a different style.    ELMIRE   If that refusal has offended you,   How little do you know a woman's heart!   How ill you guess what it would have you know,   When it presents so feeble a defence!   Always, at first, our modesty resists   The tender feelings you inspire us with.   Whatever cause we find to justify   The love that masters us, we still must feel   Some little shame in owning it; and strive   To make as though we would not, when we would.   But from the very way we go about it   We let a lover know our heart surrenders,   The while our lips, for honour's sake, oppose   Our heart's desire, and in refusing promise.   I'm telling you my secret all too freely   And with too little heed to modesty.   But--now that I've made bold to speak--pray tell me.   Should I have tried to keep Damis from speaking,   Should I have heard the offer of your heart   So quietly, and suffered all your pleading,   And taken it just as I did--remember--   If such a declaration had not pleased me,   And, when I tried my utmost to persuade you   Not to accept the marriage that was talked of,   What should my earnestness have hinted to you   If not the interest that you've inspired,   And my chagrin, should such a match compel me   To share a heart I want all to myself?    TARTUFFE   'Tis, past a doubt, the height of happiness,   To hear such words from lips we dote upon;   Their honeyed sweetness pours through all my senses   Long draughts of suavity ineffable.   My heart employs its utmost zeal to please you,   And counts your love its one beatitude;   And yet that heart must beg that you allow it   To doubt a little its felicity.   I well might think these words an honest trick   To make me break off this approaching marriage;   And if I may express myself quite plainly,   I cannot trust these too enchanting words   Until the granting of some little favour   I sigh for, shall assure me of their truth   And build within my soul,"]]]
