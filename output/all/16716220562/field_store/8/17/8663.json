To find the factor of evaporation for a given set of conditions, locate the gage pressure at the top of the table and follow down that column to the horizontal line on which the feed-water temperature is located. The value in this column and on the horizontal line thus found is the factor of evaporation required. If the feed water has a temperature greater than 212° F., obtain the proper factor of evaporation from the Marks and Davis steam tables.  Take the data of the test, for example. The average steam pressure is 100 pounds, gage. The average feed-water temperature is 180° F. So, in the table locate the column headed 100 and follow down this column to the line having 180 at the ends, and the value where the column and the line cross is 1.0727, which is the factor of evaporation for a feed-water temperature of 180° F. and a steam pressure of 100 pounds, gage.  This factor, 1.0727, indicates that to change a pound of water at 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds requires 1.0727 times as much heat as to change a pound of water at 212° F. to steam at atmospheric pressure. In other words, the heat used in producing an actual evaporation of 7 pounds under the test conditions would have evaporated 7 × 1.0727 = 7.5 pounds from and at 212° F. Hence, 7.5 pounds is called the \"equivalent evaporation from and at 212° F.\" per pound of coal used.  As already stated, it takes 970.4 B. t. u. to make a pound of steam from and at 212° F. Then to make 7.5 pounds there would be required 7.5 × 970.4 = 7,278 B. t. u. This is the amount of heat required to change 7.5 pounds of water at 212° F. to steam at zero gage pressure, but it is also the heat required to change 7 pounds of water at 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds gage pressure, because 7.5 pounds from and at 212° F. is equivalent to 7 pounds from 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds. Therefore, the 7,278 B. t. u. is the amount of heat usefully employed in making steam per pound of coal fired, and so it is the _output_. Accordingly, the efficiency of the boiler is--                            Output    7,278           ~ Efficiency =  ------ = ------ = 0.54, nearly.                           Input    13,500  In other words, the efficiency of the boiler is 0.54, or 54 per cent, which means that only a little more than half of the heat in the coal is usefully employed in making steam.  The chart shown in figure 3 is given to save the work of figuring the efficiency. If the equivalent evaporation per pound of coal is calculated and the heating value of the coal is known, the boiler efficiency may be found directly from the chart. At the left-hand side locate the point corresponding to the equivalent evaporation and at the bottom locate the point corresponding to the heating value of the coal. Follow the horizontal and vertical lines from these two points until they cross, and note the diagonal line that is nearest to the crossing point. The figures marked on the diagonal line indicate the boiler efficiency.  Take the case just worked out, for example. The equivalent evaporation is 7.5 pounds and the heating value of the fuel is 13,500 B. t. u. At the left of the chart locate the point 7.5 midway between 7 and 8 and at the bottom locate the point 13,500 midway between 13,000 and 14,000. Then follow the horizontal and vertical lines from these two points until they cross, as indicated by the dotted lines. The crossing point lies on the diagonal corresponding to 54, and so the efficiency is 54 per cent.   BOILER HORSEPOWER OR CAPACITY.  The capacity of a boiler is usually stated in boiler horsepower. A boiler horsepower means the evaporation of 34.5 pounds of water per hour from and at 212° F. Therefore, to find the boiler horsepower developed during a test, calculate the evaporation from and at 212° F. per hour and divide it by 34.5.  Take the test previously mentioned, for example. The evaporation from and at 212° F. or the equivalent evaporation, was 7.5 pounds of water per pound of coal. The weight of coal burned per hour was 5,000 ÷ 10 = 500 pounds. Then the equivalent evaporation was 7.5 × 500 = 3,750 pounds per hour. According to the foregoing definition of a boiler horsepower, then--                                     3,750                Boiler horsepower = ----- = 109.                                     34.5   The \"rated horsepower\" of a boiler, or the \"builders' rating,\" is the number of square feet of heating surface in the boiler divided by a number. In the case of stationary boilers this number is 10 or 12, but 10 is very commonly taken as the amount of heating surface per horsepower. Assuming this value and assuming further that the boiler tested had 1,500 square feet of heating surface, its rated horsepower would be 1,500 ÷ 10 = 150 boiler horsepower.  It is often desirable to know what per cent of the rated capacity is developed in a test. This is found by dividing the horsepower developed during the test by the builders' rating. In the case of the boiler tested, 109 horsepower was developed. The percentage of rated capacity developed, therefore, was 109 ÷ 150 = 0.73, or 73 per cent.   HEATING SURFACE.  The heating surface of a boiler is the surface of metal exposed to the fire or hot gases on one side and to water on the other side. Thus, the internal surface of the tubes of a fire-tube boiler is the heating surface of the tubes, but the outside surface of the tubes of a water-tube boiler is the heating surface of those tubes. In addition to the tubes, all other surfaces which have hot gases on one side and water on the other must be taken into account. For instance, in a fire-tube boiler from one-half to two-thirds of the shell (depending on how the boiler is set) acts as heating surface. In addition to this, the surface presented by both heads, below the water level, has to be computed. The heating surface of each head is equal to two-thirds its area minus the total area of the holes cut away to receive the tubes.   COST OF EVAPORATION.  The cost of evaporation is usually stated as the cost of fuel required to evaporate 1,000 pounds of water from and at 212° F. To find it, multiply the price of coal per ton by 1,000 and divide the result by the product of the equivalent evaporation per pound of coal and the number of pounds in a ton.  Suppose that the cost of the coal used in the foregoing test was $3.60 per ton of 2,000 pounds. The equivalent evaporation per pound of coal was 7.5 pounds. Therefore the cost of evaporating 1,000 pounds of water from 180° F. to steam at 100-pound gage, is--                 $3.60 × 1,000                ------------- = $0.24, or 24 cents.                 7.5  × 2,000   TABLE OF TEST RESULTS.  After the test has been made and properly worked up, as heretofore described, collect all the results of the test on one sheet, so that they can be kept in convenient form for reference and for comparison with later tests. A brief form of arranging the results is as follows:    1. Date of test                                        May 20, 1918   2. Duration of test                             hours            10   3.

The object of working up a test is to obtain a clear idea as to the efficiency of operation of the boiler or its operating cost. Consequently, after the calculations have been made, they should be used as a basis for study with the idea of improving the boiler performance.  Take the matter of boiler efficiency, for example, as found from the test mentioned. Its value was 54 per cent. This is altogether too low and indicates wasteful operation. The efficiency of a hand-fired boiler ought not to be less than 65 per cent, and it can be increased to 70 per cent by careful management under good conditions.  The chart in figure 3 can be used to indicate the evaporation that should be obtained in order to reach a desired efficiency. Suppose, for example, that it is desired to know how much water per pound of coal must be evaporated to produce a boiler efficiency of 65 per cent with coal having a heating value of 13,500 B. t. u. per pound.  Locate 13,500 at the bottom of the chart, follow the vertical line until it meets the diagonal marked 65 per cent, and then from this point follow the horizontal line to the left-hand edge, where the figure 9 is found. This means that the equivalent evaporation from and by 212° F. per pound of coal must be 9 pounds of water. If the steam pressure is 100 pounds gauge, and the feed-water temperature is 180° F. the factor of evaporation is 1.0727, then the actual evaporation must be 9 ÷ 1.0727 = 8.36 pounds per pound of coal. In other words, to increase the efficiency from 54 per cent to 65 per cent under the same conditions of pressure and feed-water temperature, it would be necessary to increase the actual evaporation from 7 pounds to 8.36"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20146"],["title","Engineering Bulletin No 1: Boiler and Furnace Testing (#3)"],["body","s. This would mean practically 20 per cent more steam from the same weight of coal used.  [Illustration: _Heating Value of Coal, in B. t. u. Per Pound_  FIG. 3.]  How to do this will require some study and experimenting on the part of the fireman or engineer. The three most common reasons for low-boiler efficiency are (1) excess air, (2) dirty heating surfaces, and (3) loss of coal through the grates. _The first of these items is the most important of the three._ In most cases the greatest preventable waste of coal in a boiler plant is directly due to excess air. Excess air simply means the amount of air which gets into the furnace and boiler which is not needed for completing the combustion of the coal. Very often twice as much air is admitted to the boiler setting as is required. This extra or excess air is heated and carries heat out through the chimney instead of heating the water in the boiler to make steam. There are two ways in which this excess air gets into the furnace and boiler setting. First, by a combination of bad regulation of drafts and firing. The chances are your uptake damper is too wide open. Try closing it a little. Then, there may be holes in the fire. Keep these covered. The second way excess air occurs is by leakage through the boiler setting, through cracks in the brickwork, leaks around the frames and edges of cleaning doors, and holes around the blow-off pipes. There are also other places where such air can leak in.  Take a torch or candle and go over the entire surface of your boiler setting--front, back, sides, and top. Where the flame of the torch is drawn inward there is an air leak. Plaster up all air leaks and repair the brickwork around door frames where necessary. You should go over your boiler for air leaks once a month.  In regard to best methods of firing soft coal, see Technical Paper No. 80 of the Bureau of Mines, which may be obtained from your State Fuel Administrator.  Dirty heating surfaces cause low efficiency because they prevent the heat in the hot gases from getting through into the water. Therefore, keep the shell and tubes free of soot on one side and scale on the other. Soot may be removed by the daily use of blowers, scrapers, and cleaners. The problem of scale and pure feed water is a big one and should be taken up with proper authorities on the subject.  There are many things that may be done to increase the efficiency of the boiler and to save coal. For convenience a number of these points are grouped in the following list:        WHAT TO DO.                      |    WHY.                                        |    1.

Make a boiler test under the conditions of operation as they now exist in your plant. Then make all possible improvements as suggested in this bulletin, make another test afterwards and note the increase in the equivalent evaporation per pound of coal used.  Remember that the _firing line_ in the boiler room can be just as patriotic and helpful as the _firing line_ at the front.   _Table of factors of evaporation._
