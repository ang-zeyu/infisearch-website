Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which threatened society at the time of the Colour Revolt; add too the certainty that Women would speedily learn to shade off their extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger of confounding a Priest with a young Woman.  How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may readily be imagined.  They anticipated with delight the confusion that would ensue.  At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and might even issue commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out of doors the striking combination of red and green, without addition of any other colours, would be sure to lead the common people into endless mistakes, and the Women would gain whatever the Circles lost, in the deference of the passers by.  As for the scandal that would befall the Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the Constitution, the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought to these considerations.  Even in the households of the Circles, the Women were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill.  The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization of the Circles themselves.  In the general intellectual decay they still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding. From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that result from that admirable training of the intellect.  Hence, up to the date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.  Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real author of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow to lower the status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of Colour, and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of training in the Art of Sight Recognition, so as to enfeeble their intellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes.  Once subjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and every childish Circle would demoralize each other.  Only in discerning between the Father and the Mother would the Circular infant find problems for the exercise of its understanding--problems too often likely to be corrupted by maternal impostures with the result of shaking the child's faith in all logical conclusions.  Thus by degrees the intellectual lustre of the Priestly Order would wane, and the road would then lie open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for the subversion of our Privileged Classes.     Section 10.  Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition    The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years; and up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy were destined to triumph.  A whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers, was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles--the Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral.  Worse than all, some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal fury.  Infuriated by political animosity, the wives in many a noble household wearied their lords with prayers to give up their opposition to the Colour Bill; and some, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell on and slaughtered their innocent children and husband, perishing themselves in the act of carnage.  It is recorded that during that triennial agitation no less than twenty-three Circles perished in domestic discord.  Great indeed was the peril.  It seemed as though the Priests had no choice between submission and extermination; when suddenly the course of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents which Statesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate, and sometimes perhaps to originate, because of the absurdly disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies of the populace.  It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at all above four degrees--accidentally dabbling in the colours of some Tradesman whose shop he had plundered--painted himself, or caused himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of a Dodecagon.  Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of deceptions--aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate, and on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the bride--he succeeded in consummating the marriage.  The unhappy girl committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been subjected.  When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds of the Women were violently agitated.  Sympathy with the miserable victim and anticipations of similar deceptions for themselves, their sisters, and their daughters, made them now regard the Colour Bill in an entirely new aspect.  Not a few openly avowed themselves converted to antagonism; the rest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar avowal.  Seizing this favourable opportunity, the Circles hastily convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States; and besides the usual guard of Convicts, they secured the attendance of a large number of reactionary Women.  Amidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days--by name Pantocyclus--arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred and twenty thousand Isosceles.  But he secured silence by declaring that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession; yielding to the wishes of the majority, they would accept the Colour Bill.  The uproar being at once converted to applause, he invited Chromatistes, the leader of the Sedition, into the centre of the hall, to receive in the name of his followers the submission of the Hierarchy.  Then followed a speech, a masterpiece of rhetoric, which occupied nearly a day in the delivery, and to which no summary can do justice.  With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation, it was desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter of the whole subject, its defects as well as its advantages.  Gradually introducing the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen, the Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs of the Isosceles by reminding them that, in spite of all these defects, he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority. But it was manifest that all, except the Isosceles, were moved by his words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill.  Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be neglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill, they ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences.  Many of them, he said, were on the point of being admitted to the class of the Regular Triangles; others anticipated for their children a distinction they could not hope for themselves.  That honourable ambition would now have to be sacrificed.  With the universal adoption of Colour, all distinctions would cease; Regularity would be confused with Irregularity; development would give place to retrogression; the Workman would in a few generations be degraded to the level of the Military, or even the Convict Class; political power would be in the hands of the greatest number, that is to say the Criminal Classes, who were already more numerous than the Workmen, and would soon out-number all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of Nature were violated.  A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and Chromatistes, in alarm, attempted to step forward and address them. But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain silent while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final appeal to the Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no marriage would henceforth be safe, no woman's honour secure; fraud, deception, hypocrisy would pervade every household; domestic bliss would share the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition. \"Sooner than this,\" he cried, \"Come death.\"  At these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action, the Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes; the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women who, under direction of the Circles, moved, back foremost, invisibly and unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating the example of their betters, also opened their ranks.  Meantime bands of Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.  The battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration.  Under the skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman's charge was fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second slaughter.  But no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles did the rest of the business for themselves.  Surprised, leader-less, attacked in front by invisible foes, and finding egress cut off by the Convicts behind them, they at once--after their manner--lost all presence of mind, and raised the cry of \"treachery\".  This sealed their fate.  Every Isosceles now saw and felt a foe in every other.  In half an hour not one of that vast multitude was living; "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20104"],["title","The Cross-Cut (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustration.

The rambling house, with its rickety, old-fashioned furniture--and its memories--was now deserted, except for Robert Fairchild, and he was deserted within it, wandering from room to room, staring at familiar objects with the unfamiliar gaze of one whose vision suddenly has been warned by the visitation of death and the sense of loneliness that it brings.  Loneliness, rather than grief, for it had been Robert Fairchild's promise that he would not suffer in heart for one who had longed to go into a peace for which he had waited, seemingly in vain.  Year after year, Thornton Fairchild had sat in the big armchair by the windows, watching the days grow old and fade into night, studying sunset after sunset, voicing the vain hope that the gloaming might bring the twilight of his own existence,--a silent man except for this, rarely speaking of the past, never giving to the son who worked for him, cared for him, worshiped him, the slightest inkling of what might have happened in the dim days of the long ago to transform him into a beaten thing, longing for the final surcease.  And when the end came, it found him in readiness, waiting in the big armchair by the windows.  Even now, a book lay on the frayed carpeting of the old room, where it had fallen from relaxing fingers.  Robert Fairchild picked it up, and with a sigh restored it to the grim, fumed oak case.  His days of petty sacrifices that his father might while away the weary hours with reading were over.  Memories!  They were all about him, in the grate with its blackened coals, the old-fashioned pictures on the walls, the almost gloomy rooms, the big chair by the window, and yet they told him nothing except that a white-haired, patient, lovable old man was gone,--a man whom he was wont to call \"father.\"  And in that going, the slow procedure of an unnatural existence had snapped for Robert Fairchild. As he roamed about in his loneliness, he wondered what he would do now, where he could go; to whom he could talk.  He had worked since sixteen, and since sixteen there had been few times when he had not come home regularly each night, to wait upon the white-haired man in the big chair, to discern his wants instinctively, and to sit with him, often in silence, until the old onyx clock on the mantel had clanged eleven; it had been the same program, day, week, month and year.  And now Robert Fairchild was as a person lost.  The ordinary pleasures of youth had never been his; he could not turn to them with any sort of grace. The years of servitude to a beloved master had inculcated within him the feeling of self-impelled sacrifice; he had forgotten all thought of personal pleasures for their sake alone.  The big chair by the window was vacant, and it created a void which Robert Fairchild could neither combat nor overcome.  What had been the past?  Why the silence?  Why the patient, yet impatient wait for death?  The son did not know.  In all his memories was only one faint picture, painted years before in babyhood: the return of his father from some place, he knew not where, a long conference with his mother behind closed doors, while he, in childlike curiosity, waited without, seeking in vain to catch some explanation. Then a sad-faced woman who cried at night when the house was still, who faded and who died.  That was all.  The picture carried no explanation.  And now Robert Fairchild stood on the threshold of something he almost feared to learn.  Once, on a black, stormy night, they had sat together, father and son before the fire, silent for hours.  Then the hand of the white-haired man had reached outward and rested for a moment on the young man's knee.  \"I wrote something to you, Boy, a day or so ago,\" he had said.  \"That little illness I had prompted me to do it.  I--I thought it was only fair to you.  After I 'm gone, look in the safe.  You 'll find the combination on a piece of paper hidden in a hole cut in that old European history in the bookcase.  I have your promise, I know--that you 'll not do it until after I 'm gone.\"  Now Thornton Fairchild was gone.  But a message had remained behind; one which the patient lips evidently had feared to utter during life. The heart of the son began to pound, slow and hard, as, with the memory of that conversation, he turned toward the bookcase and unlatched the paneled door.  A moment more and the hollowed history had given up its trust, a bit of paper scratched with numbers.  Robert Fairchild turned toward the stairs and the small room on the second floor which had served as his father's bedroom.  There he hesitated before the little iron safe in the corner, summoning the courage to unlock the doors of a dead man's past.  At last he forced himself to his knees and to the numerals of the combination.  The safe had not been opened in years; that was evident from the creaking of the plungers as they fell, the gummy resistance of the knob as Fairchild turned it in accordance with the directions on the paper. Finally, a great wrench, and the bolt was drawn grudgingly back; a strong pull, and the safe opened.  A few old books; ledgers in sheepskin binding.  Fairchild disregarded these for the more important things that might lie behind the little inner door of the cabinet.  His hand went forward, and he noticed, in a hazy sort of way, that it was trembling.  The door was unlocked; he drew it open and crouched a moment, staring, before he reached for the thinner of two envelopes which lay before him.  A moment later he straightened and turned toward the light.  A crinkling of paper, a quick-drawn sigh between clenched teeth; it was a letter; his strange, quiet, hunted-appearing father was talking to him through the medium of ink and paper, after death.  Closely written, hurriedly, as though to finish an irksome task in as short a space as possible, the missive was one of several pages,--pages which Robert Fairchild hesitated to read.  The secret--and he knew full well that there was a secret--had been in the atmosphere about him ever since he could remember.  Whether or not this was the solution of it, Robert Fairchild did not know, and the natural reticence with which he had always approached anything regarding his father's life gave him an instinctive fear, a sense of cringing retreat from anything that might now open the doors of mystery.  But it was before him, waiting in his father's writing, and at last his gaze centered; he read:   My son:  Before I begin this letter to you I must ask that you take no action whatever until you have seen my attorney--he will be yours from now on. I have never mentioned him to you before; it was not necessary and would only have brought you curiosity which I could not have satisfied. But now, I am afraid, the doors must be unlocked.  I am gone.  You are young, you have been a faithful son and you are deserving of every good fortune that may possibly come to you.  I am praying that the years have made a difference, and that Fortune may smile upon you as she frowned on me.  Certainly, she can injure me no longer.  My race is run; I am beyond earthly fortunes.  Therefore, when you have finished with this, take the deeds inclosed in the larger envelope and go to St. Louis.  There, look up Henry F. Beamish, attorney-at-law, in the Princess Building.  He will explain them to you.  Beyond this, I fear, there is little that can aid you.  I cannot find the strength, now that I face it, to tell you what you may find if you follow the lure that the other envelope holds forth to you.  There is always the hope that Fortune may be kind to me at last, and smile upon my memory by never letting you know why I have been the sort of man you have known, and not the jovial, genial companion that a father should be.  But there are certain things, my son, which defeat a man.  It killed your mother--every day since her death I have been haunted by that fact; my prayer is that it may not kill you, spiritually, if not physically.  Therefore is it not better that it remain behind a cloud until such time as Fortune may reveal it--and hope that such a time will never come?  I think so--not for myself, for when you read this, I shall be gone; but for you, that you may not be handicapped by the knowledge of the thing which whitened my hair and aged me, long before my time.  If he lives, and I am sure he does, there is one who will hurry to your aid as soon as he knows you need him.  Accept his counsels, laugh at his little eccentricities if you will, but follow his judgment implicitly.  Above all, ask him no questions that he does not care to answer--there are things that he may not deem wise to tell.  It is only fair that he be given the right to choose his disclosures.  There is little more to say.  Beamish will attend to everything for you--if you care to go.  Sell everything that is here; the house, the furniture, the belongings.  It is my wish, and you will need the capital--if you go.  The ledgers in the safe are only old accounts which would be so much Chinese to you now.  Burn them.  There is nothing else to be afraid of--I hope you will never find anything to fear.  And if circumstances should arise to bring before you the story of that which has caused me so much darkness, I have"]]]
