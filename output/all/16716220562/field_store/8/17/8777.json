Born at Paris in January, 1622, where his father held a position in the royal household, he was educated at the Jesuit College de Clermont, and for some time studied law, which he soon abandoned for the stage. His life was spent in Paris and in the provinces, acting, directing performances, managing theaters, and writing plays. He had his share of applause from the king and from the public; but the satire in his comedies made him many enemies, and he was the object of the most venomous attacks and the most impossible slanders. Nor did he find much solace at home; for he married unfortunately, and the unhappiness that followed increased the bitterness that public hostility had brought into his life. On February 17, 1673, while acting in \"La Malade Imaginaire,\" the last of his masterpieces, he was seized with illness and died a few hours later.  The first of the greater works of Moliere was \"Les Precieuses Ridicules,\" produced in 1659. In this brilliant piece Moliere lifted French comedy to a new level and gave it a new purpose--the satirizing of contemporary manners and affectations by frank portrayal and criticism. In the great plays that followed, \"The School for Husbands\" and \"The School for Wives,\" \"The Misanthrope\" and \"The Hypocrite\" (Tartuffe), \"The Miser\" and \"The Hypochondriac,\" \"The Learned Ladies,\" \"The Doctor in Spite of Himself,\" \"The Citizen Turned Gentleman,\" and many others, he exposed mercilessly one after another the vices and foibles of the day.  His characteristic qualities are nowhere better exhibited than in \"Tartuffe.\" Compared with such characterization as Shakespeare's, Moliere's method of portraying life may seem to be lacking in complexity; but it is precisely the simplicity with which creations like Tartuffe embody the weakness or vice they represent that has given them their place as universally recognized types of human nature.       TARTUFFE    A COMEDY      CHARACTERS    MADAME PERNELLE, mother of Orgon   ORGON, husband of Elmire   ELMIRE, wife of Orgon   DAMIS, son of Orgon   MARIANE, daughter of Orgon, in love with Valere   CLEANTE, brother-in-law of Orgon   TARTUFFE, a hypocrite   DORINE, Mariane's maid   M. LOYAL, a bailiff   A Police Officer   FLIPOTTE, Madame Pernelle's servant      The Scene is at Paris       ACT I      SCENE I    MADAME PERNELLE and FLIPOTTE, her servant; ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE,   DAMIS, DORINE     MADAME PERNELLE   Come, come, Flipotte, and let me get away.    ELMIRE   You hurry so, I hardly can attend you.    MADAME PERNELLE   Then don't, my daughter-in law. Stay where you are.   I can dispense with your polite attentions.    ELMIRE   We're only paying what is due you, mother.   Why must you go away in such a hurry?    MADAME PERNELLE   Because I can't endure your carryings-on,   And no one takes the slightest pains to please me.   I leave your house, I tell you, quite disgusted;   You do the opposite of my instructions;   You've no respect for anything; each one   Must have his say; it's perfect pandemonium.    DORINE   If ...    MADAME PERNELLE   You're a servant wench, my girl, and much   Too full of gab, and too impertinent   And free with your advice on all occasions.    DAMIS   But ...    MADAME PERNELLE   You're a fool, my boy--f, o, o, l   Just spells your name. Let grandma tell you that   I've said a hundred times to my poor son,   Your father, that you'd never come to good   Or give him anything but plague and torment.    MARIANE   I think ...    MADAME PERNELLE   O dearie me, his little sister!   You're all demureness, butter wouldn't melt   In your mouth, one would think to look at you.   Still waters, though, they say ... you know the proverb;   And I don't like your doings on the sly.    ELMIRE   But, mother ...    MADAME PERNELLE   Daughter, by your leave, your conduct   In everything is altogether wrong;   You ought to set a good example for 'em;   Their dear departed mother did much better.   You are extravagant; and it offends me,   To see you always decked out like a princess.   A woman who would please her husband's eyes   Alone, wants no such wealth of fineries.    CLEANTE   But, madam, after all ...    MADAME PERNELLE   Sir, as for you,   The lady's brother, I esteem you highly,   Love and respect you. But, sir, all the same,   If I were in my son's, her husband's, place,   I'd urgently entreat you not to come   Within our doors. You preach a way of living   That decent people cannot tolerate.   I'm rather frank with you; but that's my way--   I don't mince matters, when I mean a thing.    DAMIS   Mr. Tartuffe, your friend, is mighty lucky ...    MADAME PERNELLE   He is a holy man, and must be heeded;   I can't endure, with any show of patience,   To hear a scatterbrains like you attack him.    DAMIS   What! Shall I let a bigot criticaster   Come and usurp a tyrant's power here?   And shall we never dare amuse ourselves   Till this fine gentleman deigns to consent?    DORINE   If we must hark to him, and heed his maxims,   There's not a thing we do but what's a crime;   He censures everything, this zealous carper.    MADAME PERNELLE   And all he censures is well censured, too.   He wants to guide you on the way to heaven;   My son should train you all to love him well.    DAMIS   No, madam, look you, nothing--not my father   Nor anything--can make me tolerate him.   I should belie my feelings not to say so.   His actions rouse my wrath at every turn;   And I foresee that there must come of it   An open rupture with this sneaking scoundrel.    DORINE   Besides, 'tis downright scandalous to see   This unknown upstart master of the house--   This vagabond, who hadn't, when he came,   Shoes to his feet, or clothing worth six farthings,   And who so far forgets his place, as now   To censure everything, and rule the roost!    MADAME PERNELLE   Eh! Mercy sakes alive! Things would go better   If all were governed by his pious orders.    DORINE   He passes for a saint in your opinion.   In fact, he's nothing but a hypocrite.    MADAME PERNELLE   Just listen to her tongue!    DORINE   I wouldn't trust him,   Nor yet his Lawrence, without bonds and surety.    MADAME PERNELLE   I don't know what the servant's character   May be; but I can guarantee the master   A holy man. You hate him and reject him   Because he tells home truths to all of you.   'Tis sin alone that moves his heart to anger,   And heaven's interest is his only motive.    DORINE   Of course. But why, especially of late,   Can he let nobody come near the house?   Is heaven offended at a civil call   That he should make so great a fuss about it?   I'll tell you, if you like, just what I think;   (Pointing to Elmire)   Upon my word, he's jealous of our mistress.    MADAME PERNELLE   You hold your tongue, and think what you are saying.   He's not alone in censuring these visits;   The turmoil that attends your sort of people,   Their carriages forever at the door,   And all their noisy footmen, flocked together,   Annoy the neighbourhood, and raise a scandal.   I'd gladly think there's nothing really wrong;   But it makes talk; and that's not as it should be.    CLEANTE   Eh! madam, can you hope to keep folk's tongues   From wagging? It would be a grievous thing   If, for the fear of idle talk about us,   We had to sacrifice our friends. No, no;   Even if we could bring ourselves to do it,   Think you that everyone would then be silenced?   Against backbiting there is no defence   So let us try to live in innocence,   To silly tattle pay no heed at all,   And leave the gossips free to vent their gall.    DORINE   Our neighbour Daphne, and her little husband,   Must be the ones who slander us, I'm thinking.   Those whose own conduct's most ridiculous,   Are always quickest to speak ill of others;   They never fail to seize at once upon   The slightest hint of any love affair,   And spread the news of it with glee, and give it   The character they'd have the world believe in.   By others' actions, painted in their colours,   They hope to justify their own; they think,   In the false hope of some resemblance, either   To make their own intrigues seem innocent,   Or else to make their neighbours share the blame   Which they are loaded with by everybody.    MADAME PERNELLE   These arguments are nothing to the purpose.   Orante, we all know, lives a perfect life;   Her thoughts are all of heaven; and I have heard   That she condemns the company you keep.    DORINE   O admirable pattern! Virtuous dame!   She lives the model of austerity;   But age has brought this piety upon her,   And she's a prude, now she can't help herself.   As long as she could capture men's attentions   She made the most of her advantages;   But, now she sees her beauty vanishing,   She wants to leave the world, that's leaving her,   And in the specious veil of haughty virtue   She'd hide the weakness of her worn-out charms.   That is the way with all your old coquettes;   They find it hard to see their lovers leave 'em;   And thus abandoned, their forlorn estate   Can find no occupation but a prude's.   These pious dames, in their austerity,   Must carp at everything, and pardon nothing.   They loudly blame their neighbours' way of living,   Not for religion's sake, but out of envy,   Because they can't endure to see another   Enjoy the pleasures age has weaned them from.    MADAME PERNELLE (to Elmire)   There! That's the kind of rigmarole to please you,   Daughter-in-law. One never has a chance   To get a word in edgewise, at your house,   Because this lady holds the floor all day;   But none the less, I mean to have my say, too.   I tell you that my son did nothing wiser   In all his life, than take this godly man   Into his household; heaven sent him here,   In your "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2027"],["title","Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite (#1)"],["body","need, to make you all repent;   For your salvation, you must hearken to him;   He censures nothing but deserves his censure.   These visits, these assemblies, and these balls,   Are all inventions of the evil spirit.   You never hear a word of godliness   At them--but idle cackle, nonsense, flimflam.   Our neighbour often comes in for a share,   The talk flies fast, and scandal fills the air;   It makes a sober person's head go round,   At these assemblies, just to hear the sound   Of so much gab, with not a word to say;   And as a learned man remarked one day   Most aptly, 'tis the Tower of Babylon,   Where all, beyond all limit, babble on.   And just to tell you how this point came in ...    (To Cleante)   So! Now the gentlemen must snicker, must he?   Go find fools like yourself to make you laugh   And don't ...    (To Elmire)   Daughter, good-bye; not one word more.   As for this house, I leave the half unsaid;   But I shan't soon set foot in it again,    (Cuffing Flipotte)   Come, you! What makes you dream and stand agape,   Hussy! I'll warm your ears in proper shape!   March, trollop, march!      SCENE II    CLEANTE, DORINE     CLEANTE   I won't escort her down,   For fear she might fall foul of me again;   The good old lady ...    DORINE   Bless us! What a pity   She shouldn't hear the way you speak of her!   She'd surely tell you you're too \"good\" by half,   And that she's not so \"old\" as all that, neither!    CLEANTE   How she got angry with us all for nothing!   And how she seems possessed with her Tartuffe!    DORINE   Her case is nothing, though, beside her son's!   To see him, you would say he's ten times worse!   His conduct in our late unpleasantness [1]   Had won him much esteem, and proved his courage   In service of his king; but now he's like   A man besotted, since he's been so taken   With this Tartuffe. He calls him brother, loves him   A hundred times as much as mother, son,   Daughter, and wife. He tells him all his secrets   And lets him guide his acts, and rule his conscience.   He fondles and embraces him; a sweetheart   Could not, I think, be loved more tenderly;   At table he must have the seat of honour,   While with delight our master sees him eat   As much as six men could; we must give up   The choicest tidbits to him; if he belches,   ('tis a servant speaking) [2]   Master exclaims: \"God bless you!\"--Oh, he dotes   Upon him! he's his universe, his hero;   He's lost in constant admiration, quotes him   On all occasions, takes his trifling acts   For wonders, and his words for oracles.   The fellow knows his dupe, and makes the most on't,   He fools him with a hundred masks of virtue,   Gets money from him all the time by canting,   And takes upon himself to carp at us.   Even his silly coxcomb of a lackey   Makes it his business to instruct us too;   He comes with rolling eyes to preach at us,   And throws away our ribbons, rouge, and patches.   The wretch, the other day, tore up a kerchief   That he had found, pressed in the _Golden Legend_,   Calling it a horrid crime for us to mingle   The devil's finery with holy things.    [Footnote 1: Referring to the rebellion called La Fronde, during the   minority of Louis XIV.]    [Footnote 2: Moliere's note, inserted in the text of all the old   editions. It is a curious illustration of the desire for uniformity   and dignity of style in dramatic verse of the seventeenth century,   that Moliere feels called on to apologize for a touch of realism like   this. Indeed, these lines were even omitted when the play was given.]      SCENE III    ELMIRE, MARIANE, DAMIS, CLEANTE, DORINE     ELMIRE (to Cleante)   You're very lucky to have missed the speech   She gave us at the door. I see my husband   Is home again. He hasn't seen me yet,   So I'll go up and wait till he comes in.    CLEANTE   And I, to save time, will await him here;   I'll merely say good-morning, and be gone.      SCENE IV    CLEANTE, DAMIS, DORINE    DAMIS   I wish you'd say a word to him about   My sister's marriage; I suspect Tartuffe   Opposes it, and puts my father up   To all these wretched shifts. You know, besides,   How nearly I'm concerned in it myself;   If love unites my sister and Valere,   I love his sister too; and if this marriage   Were to ...    DORINE   He's coming.      SCENE V    ORGON, CLEANTE, DORINE     ORGON   Ah! Good morning, brother.    CLEANTE   I was just going, but am glad to greet you.   Things are not far advanced yet, in the country?    ORGON   Dorine ...    (To Cleante)   Just wait a bit, please, brother-in-law.   Let me allay my first anxiety   By asking news about the family.    (To Dorine)   Has everything gone well these last two days?   What's happening? And how is everybody?    DORINE   Madam had fever, and a splitting headache   Day before yesterday, all day and evening.    ORGON   And how about Tartuffe?    DORINE   Tartuffe? He's well;   He's mighty well; stout, fat, fair, rosy-lipped.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   At evening she had nausea   And couldn't touch a single thing for supper,   Her headache still was so severe.    ORGON   And how   About Tartuffe?    DORINE   He supped alone, before her,   And unctuously ate up two partridges,   As well as half a leg o' mutton, deviled.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   All night she couldn't get a wink   Of sleep, the fever racked her so; and we   Had to sit up with her till daylight.    ORGON   How   About Tartuffe?    DORINE   Gently inclined to slumber,   He left the table, went into his room,   Got himself straight into a good warm bed,   And slept quite undisturbed until next morning.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   At last she let us all persuade her,   And got up courage to be bled; and then   She was relieved at once.    ORGON   And how about   Tartuffe?    DORINE   He plucked up courage properly,   Bravely entrenched his soul against all evils,   And to replace the blood that she had lost,   He drank at breakfast four huge draughts of wine.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   So now they both are doing well;   And I'll go straightway and inform my mistress   How pleased you are at her recovery.      SCENE VI    ORGON, CLEANTE     CLEANTE   Brother, she ridicules you to your face;   And I, though I don't want to make you angry,   Must tell you candidly that she's quite right.   Was such infatuation ever heard of?   And can a man to-day have charms to make you   Forget all else, relieve his poverty,   Give him a home, and then ... ?    ORGON   Stop there, good brother,   You do not know the man you're speaking of.    CLEANTE   Since you will have it so, I do not know him;   But after all, to tell what sort of man   He is ...    ORGON   Dear brother, you'd be charmed to know him;   Your raptures over him would have no end.   He is a man ... who ... ah! ... in fact ...a man   Whoever does his will, knows perfect peace,   And counts the whole world else, as so much dung.   His converse has transformed me quite; he weans   My heart from every friendship, teaches me   To have no love for anything on earth;   And I could see my brother, children, mother,   And wife, all die, and never care--a snap.    CLEANTE   Your feelings are humane, I must say, brother!    ORGON   Ah! If you'd seen him, as I saw him first,   You would have loved him just as much as I.   He came to church each day, with contrite mien,   Kneeled, on both knees, right opposite my place,   And drew the eyes of all the congregation,   To watch the fervour of his prayers to heaven;   With deep-drawn sighs and great ejaculations,   He humbly kissed the earth at every moment;   And when I left the church, he ran before me   To give me holy water at the door.   I learned his poverty, and who he was,   By questioning his servant, who is like him,   And gave him gifts; but in his modesty   He always wanted to return a part.   \"It is too much,\" he'd say, \"too much by half;   I am not worthy of your pity.\" Then,   When I refused to take it back, he'd go,   Before my eyes, and give it to the poor.   At length heaven bade me take him to my home,   And since that day, all seems to prosper here.   He censures everything, and for my sake   He even takes great interest in my wife;   He lets me know who ogles her, and seems   Six times as jealous as I am myself.   You'd not believe how far his zeal can go:   He calls himself a sinner just for trifles;   The merest nothing is enough to shock him;   So much so, that the other day I heard him   Accuse himself for having, while at prayer,   In too much anger caught and killed a flea.    CLEANTE   Zounds, brother, you are mad, I think! Or else   You're making sport of me, with such a speech.   What are you driving at with all this nonsense ... ?    ORGON   Brother, your language smacks of atheism;   And I suspect your soul's a little tainted   Therewith. I've preached to you a score of times   That you'll draw down some judgment on your head.    CLEANTE   That is the usual strain of all your kind;   They must have every one as blind as they.   They call you atheist if you have good eyes;   And if you don't adore their vain grimaces,   You've neither faith nor care for sacred things.   No, no; such talk can't frighten me; I know   What I am saying; heaven sees my heart.   We're not the dupes of all your canting mummers;   There are false heroes--and false devotees;   And as true heroes never are the ones   Who make much noise about their deeds of honour,   Just so true devotees, whom we should follow,   Are not the ones who make so much vain show.   What! Will you find no difference between   Hypocrisy and genuine devoutness?   And will you treat them both alike, and pay   The self-same honour both to masks and faces   Set artifice beside sincerity,   Confuse the semblance with reality,   Esteem a phantom like a living person,   And counterfeit as good as honest coin?   Men, for the most part, are strange creatures, truly!   You never find them keep the golden mean;   The limits"]]]
