As for the fireman he took a novel way of making his escape, by diving into the shelving bank of coal and letting it slide over him. In the excitement of the flurry of firing he was able to do this.  Jim and Ketchel both leaped from the same side of the engine and were protected by a slight cut alongside of the track. Bullets whirred and cut into the dirt around them. As they ran both of them sent a shot at the man on the near side of the blind baggage, with such good effect that he pitched to the ground with an injured leg.  \"Duck low, Jim,\" yelled the engineer; \"we will beat them yet. I've got a scheme.\"  \"I'm with you,\" replied Jim.  This was literally true, for he was right at the heels of the scurrying Bob. As they passed the barricade of stones, Ketchel gave it a quick, searching look, then in a few strides they got to cover in a culvert a number of yards in front of the pile of stone. By the help of a few ties they made a respectable fort.  \"So far, so well,\" said Ketchel, \"but it won't do to stay here very long, for they will loot the train.\"  \"Nearly the whole gang is down there,\" cried Jim, \"I can tell by the firing.\"  \"We've got to clear that barricade off the track and quick, too,\" declared the engineer. \"It's our only hope.\"  \"Those stones are pretty heavy to lift off under fire,\" said Jim composedly, \"but I guess we can make a go of it.\"  \"I like your nerve,\" said Ketchel, a gleam of admiration showing for an instant in his usually noncommittal face, \"but I've got something here, that will help us in this hoisting business,\" and he thrust his hand into one of the pockets of his overalls.  \"What is it?\" queried Jim.  \"Dynamite,\" replied the engineer, producing a small chunk of the same to view.  \"Won't it blow up the engine, too?\" asked Jim.  \"Not likely with this amount,\" said Ketchel. \"We will have to chance it anyhow.\"  \"Ain't you afraid that you might take a chaw on it, by mistake for your tobacco?\" queried Jim in a matter-of-fact voice. Bob Ketchel only grinned by way of reply.  \"Now is our chance,\" whispered the engineer; \"keep the beggars lying low while I start the fireworks.\"  \"I'll attend to that,\" replied Jim briefly and with emphasis.  Then two crouching figures slipped out from the culvert, and Jim kept on the move with the quick dodging motions of a boxer so that the enemy in ambush could not get a bead on him. Flashing the fire of his revolver this side and that at a cluster of rock, or a clump of bushes he dodged on, and such was his accuracy that not a man in the attacking party dared show himself in the open.  Jim was able to keep down their fire, as his ally rushed to the barricade; then Ketchel stooped down and thrust the dynamite into an opening between the rocks and drawing off quickly threw himself flat down by the track. Then there came an upheaval that shook things. A geyser of rocks shot into the air, and in a jiffy Jim and the engineer had cleared off what remained on the track in the shape of debris. The engine itself had most of the cowcatcher torn off and the headlight smashed.  \"Spoiled her beauty for you,\" said Jim. \"But we will spoil their game I guess, and I don't think the railroad company will complain at the loss of a cowcatcher.\" Meantime both had raced back to the engine.  Before the gang had time to fully realize what had happened, Ketchel had regained his place in the cab and had turned the engine loose on the sanded rails. Within a remarkably short distance he had her full speed ahead, with a parting salute of shots from the enraged and baffled \"hold ups.\"  \"There goes three of 'em,\" cried Jim, who had swung aboard. \"My what a jump.\"  They shot from the rear of the train like projectiles from a catapult, rolling over and over down a steep embankment. Two got up very slowly but the third lay as if dead.  \"Where's Sheehan?\" cried the engineer; \"we haven't lost him I hope.\"  \"Gosh! he's in the coal!\" exclaimed Jim.  He leaped into the tender and saw a movement under the coal. Working frantically, Jim was able to drag their submerged ally from the retreat that had almost buried him. The cold air brought him to, and he rose staggeringly to his feet.  \"Yer started your thrain too suddint, Mr. Ketchel, and pulled two ton of coal over my poor head,\" cried the fireman in half humorous indignation. \"Why didn't you whistle and give me fair warning as to your intentions. And how did you lads escape without bullets in your hides. Yer must have charmed lives the both of you.\"  \"How many of 'em did you get, Bill,\" yelled back the engineer from his cab.  \"Aye, there is many of them that will carry black marks the rest of their lives, where I handed them some chunks of coal.\"  \"The company will take it out of your salary for wasting their coal,\" remarked Ketchel.  \"And shure and they ain't none too good to do it,\" remarked Bill Sheehan with conviction.  \"Get in, Bill, and throw what coal you have got left into that boiler; we have got to make the siding this side of the Divide to get out of the way of 'The Eastern Express.' That little fracas back there cost us fifteen minutes.\"  \"And half a ton of coal,\" said the fireman, as he bent his back to the work of shoveling, looking for all the world like a black gnome.  \"I wonder what has happened to the passengers,\" said Jim to the engineer; \"there seemed to be a lot going on back there the last five minutes of the fight.\"  \"I can't slow up, Jim,\" responded the engineer, \"because we have got to make that siding.\"  \"I don't expect you to, Bob,\" replied Jim, \"I'll go over the roofs. I can make it if those open air burglars did.\"  \"It's durn risky,\" warned the engineer; \"we are speeding now, and the train is twisting so it will sure throw you on some of the curves.\"  \"I've ridden a few bronchos in my time,\" declared Jim, \"and been aloft in some heavy seas and I guess I can manage this.\"  Self-confidence is all right but pride often goes before destruction and Jim came very near getting his on this occasion.  \"And where do you think you are going, lad?\" asked Bill Sheehan, as Jim started on his climb over the tender.  \"I'm going back to see how many of the passengers have been scared to death and why some of those guys in the sleepers didn't turn out and help us to fight off those bandits back there.\"  \"Oh, them are tenderfeet from way back the other side of the range, they was too busy hiding behind their women folks to fight,\" declared the fireman, \"but you ain't going on no such trip young feller.\" He made a dive for Jim but that worthy was not to be detained and was half way up the little iron ladder before Bill Sheehan had recovered his balance. \"Come back,\" he cried, poising a bit of coal in his hand, \"or I'll bring you back.\" This bluff did not disturb Jim who was now on top of the baggage car.  \"Just like a young limb,\" he muttered, as he watched the daring James. \"I'd have done the same twenty years ago.\"  Jim crawled or sneaked his way along the elevated part of the roof, so that he could clutch one side or the other in case of need. The train was now winding through a narrow gulch in a line of hills and a fierce wind tore at his body as though trying to fling him loose. He felt that it was more than he had bargained for, as the grimy roof slipped this way and that under him, then there came a sudden lurch and he was lifted clear off the top of the car and one hand was wrenched loose, and in a second his feet were hanging over the side.  His other hand caught the steel rod that opens one of the small windows in the elevated roof of the car. Would it hold? On its strength depended his only chance of life. He drew himself up slowly with every ounce of his strength. The rod bent but held and once more he was back on the roof. So he took his perilous way along and at last he reached the foreward coach. The door was guarded and he came near being shot by the suspicious conductor, who took him for one of the bandits.     CHAPTER IV  THE GIRL AND THE ENGINEER   Indeed Jim's appearance was much against him. He was covered with dirt and grime and coal dust. It was only by holding his ticket against the pane of glass in the door of the coach, that the conductor was made willing to admit him. But when he was informed who Jim was he treated him with due respect and even cordiality. That was pretty good for a conductor in those days.  Jim was an object of interest as he passed through the coach. He might have blushed at finding himself a hero, but if so he was perfectly disguised by his temporary color, which was decidedly dusky.  \"Oh, Mamma,\" cried a youngster, \"I'm afraid of that big black man. Will he steal me!\"  \"Nonsense, Willie, that's the nice, kind gentleman, who gave you some candy at the station yesterday.\" Jim laughed and the only show of white about him was his teeth. \"I don't blame the little chap for being scared,\" he said, \"I'm a bad looking object for a fact.\"  \"You ought to have seen three of those fellows jump,\" remarked Mr. Conductor, as they went on their way through the train; \"that was when Bob opened up. I guess one of 'em was badly shook up by the way he lit.\"  \"I saw them take their flying leap,\" returned Jim, \"but was anybody hurt back here?\"  \"The brakeman got it in the shoulder,\" replied the conductor, \"but I guess he will be all right. Have to take a lay-off for some weeks.\"  \"It's curious how many bullets are fired without hurting anybody,\" remarked Jim, \"but I've noticed that before.\"  The conductor looked at the tall young fellow keenly for a moment.  \"I reckon you are no tenderfoot,\" he asserted.  \"Right there!\" replied Jim; \"that is if experience counts. But I was born in the East.\"  \"You can't help that,\" remarked the conductor, to Jim's amusement; \"you would have laughed to see them fellows lying close to the floor of the car, when the shooting was going on. It ain't a dignified sight to see a round fat man trying to make himself small by lying as flat as possible.\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20259"],["title","Frontier Boys in Frisco (#3)"],["body"," \"I can't blame them,\" replied Jim; \"I would have been trying the same maneuver if I had been there.\"  \"No, you wouldn't,\" contradicted the Taker of Tickets; \"you would have been busy trying to get a line on some of the gents who were kicking up a ruction outside.  \"Maybe,\" said Jim doubtfully.  When they entered the first Pullman, Jim was in the lead and at the sight of a tall, blackened-looking individual entering through the plush portières into the main body of the car several of the women shrieked, and two stout gentlemen dived down between the seats.  \"Conductor!\" they yelled; \"Conductor! help!\"  Jim was greatly embarrassed by this reception, and started to back out hastily, but was stopped by the rotund figure of the greatly in demand conductor.  \"Ha! ha!\" he roared. \"Ladies and gentlemen don't be frightened. This young man is no desperado, but he has been fighting them off down in front on the engine during the late hold up.\"  Slowly like twin round moons rose the faces of the two stout men from opposite sections.  \"I say, Conductor,\" remarked one of them who was an Englishman, \"this is a jolly shame. Can't we travel in peace in this beastly country? Always some bally ructions going on, don't yer know.\"  The conductor's answer was rather abrupt for he did not fancy the Englishman's style of speech, and that testy individual was more upset than ever. Jim went quickly to his section, got a change of clothing, retired to the wash room and proceeded to get thoroughly cleaned up.  This was quite an operation, undertaken in the presence of two drummers who were smoking and talking in bragging tones of what they had done during the recent fight. Jim was too busy to pay any attention to their talk until one of them addressed him directly.  \"Where was you, young fellow, when we was held up back there?\" questioned one.  \"I was forward,\" replied Jim shortly. He did not take especially to either of the two men.  \"Bet you were hiding under the trucks,\" asserted the other. Jim did not know whether to laugh, or to throw the fellow out of the window. He had not noticed the conductor who was standing in the passageway, but that worthy had overheard the remark.  \"Who did you say hid under the trucks?\" he inquired belligerently. The man addressed feebly indicated Jim, then the conductor lit into the fellow for fair.  \"You trying to run that young fellow? Why if he took the notion into his head, he could turn you up simultaneous and paddle whack both of you. Why you ain't nothing but--\" however, I draw a veil over this part of the harangue.  Jim laughed good-naturedly but said nothing.  After the conductor had left, the men took the opposite tack and were very fulsome in their praise of Jim. Wanted him to drink with them and all that sort of cheap comradeship, but he would have none of their game and got out as soon as he could.  At the first stop the train made, James went forward to join his two friends on the engine.  \"And who may you be?\" queried the fireman; \"you look very much like the Vice-president of this railroad instead of the tramp I saw some hours agone trying to ride the blind baggage.\"  \"I've got my face washed, Bill, and a fresh shirt to my back and my moccasins polished if that is what you are aiming at,\" replied Jim good humoredly.  \"I must say, Jim, it gave me a scare when I saw you swing over the edge of the car, but it was no use for me to try and slow up then, besides I had time to make up, and the engineer can't stop for his best friend then. But I must say you have a cast-iron nerve.\"  \"I felt scared,\" admitted Jim frankly.  \"You had reason to,\" remarked Bill Sheehan.  \"All aboard, boys,\" cried the engineer. \"I see the conductor is waving us to go on. You take Bill's side of the cab and watch me drive her into the Junction. That's my terminus and we will have breakfast together.\"  \"Wish you were going to the coast with me, Bob,\" remarked Jim. \"I'm in for some trouble there I'm afraid, and you are the chap I should want to back me up, and that's solid.\"  \"I'd take you up in a minute, Jim,\" then he lowered his voice, \"but you see there's a girl at the Junction and we are to be married next month.\" Jim gave his friend a hearty slap on his broad back.  \"Glad to hear it, Bob, old boy, and may it be a lucky go for both of you.\"  \"Thanks, Jim,\" replied Ketchel, and there was a dubious moisture in his eyes, which vanished in a second, as he watched keenly the road ahead.  Jim always remembered the ride into the Junction. The moonlight had faded from the sky and the fuller, keener daylight was creeping in to take its place. The train was now puffing along just below timber line, and in the west was a semi-circle of snowy peaks, rugged, superb, symmetrical, with the tint of dawn gilding their summits.  On the mountains through which the train was passing were great patches of snow. The air had that marvelous clearness that Jim knew so well and his eyes sparkled, as he breathed it in deeply. Just as the sun came up he saw below at a distance of several miles, in a snow lined basin in the hills, the dark patch of the Junction. As they neared it, Jim's keen eye saw the figure of a girl standing on the porch of a small white cottage. There was something very attractive about the young figure standing there, with the color of health in her face, and a look of fervor in her eyes. A signal passed between the engineer and the girl and then the train roared on towards the station.  \"I don't blame you for not wanting to go to California, Bob,\" said Jim.  The engineer smiled good-naturedly but was content to let Jim's surmise go unconfirmed.  \"The boss is shure done for,\" interrupted the fireman; \"he won't be the same high spirited man in a few years he is now. It's all very tempting, but it's like tolling an ox to get his neck under the yoke. It's a terrible thing to see a young fellow like him bent on taking responsibilities he don't know the heft of.\" Ketchel only grinned at Bill Sheehan's doleful prophecy for he knew the root of it, as the fireman's wife was something of a termagant and the sound of her scoldings had reached other ears than Bill's.  Now came the whistle for the Junction, and the train slowed to a halt on a long level platform on which lay a six-inch carpet of dazzling snow.     CHAPTER V  THE MENU   That morning always stood out in Jim's memory, not because of any unusual adventure, nor because it marked any period in his young existence, but simply that he felt full of the exuberance of life, after the night's adventure; the very air was intoxicating. That, by the way, was the only intoxicant James ever took. He was glad to be with his old friend, Bob Ketchel, even for a short time.  Then, too, there was the certainty of immediate events of interest as soon as he reached San Francisco, and he felt confident that he could meet whatever might come. His past experiences had taught him self-reliance and he thrilled to the sense of coming adventures. But the fact that he was soon to enjoy a good breakfast had something to do with his feeling of contentment. Besides, he and the engineer were objects of interest in this little mountain settlement, for the story of the attempted hold up was soon common property, and the two were the observed of all observers. This is not unpleasant, as many a schoolboy hero of the football field or track knows right well.  In about fifteen minutes' time Jim and the engineer were seated at a pleasant looking table in a sunny corner of the dining-room, with the whitest of cloths and everything about the table neat and attractive. It was not at all like the Wild West, and it is at the eating stations that whatever of luxury or comfort there is in this wild country is concentrated.  There was a hearty menu of several kinds of meats and gravies, fried potatoes in abundance, excellent coffee in large cups, and smoking plates of griddle cakes with plenty of syrup. Jim ate with an appetite derived from a long fast, and plenty of exercise. The reader can vouch as to the amount of exercise that James had undergone in the past few hours. The dining-room was full of tourists at the different tables, and it was a lively and animated scene. The events of the previous night were the general subject of discussion and Jim was fully aware that he was being talked about. But he was a well balanced chap, and was not the least \"swelled\" by the notice taken of him.  He and the engineer had a good time telling each other of the adventures that had come their way during the years since they last met. Jim could tell his friend of their wonderful trip into Mexico, the excursion into Hawaii, and what occurred in the Hollow Mountain, likewise of their encounter with Captain Broome, that booming old pirate whose splendid yacht they had seized after a struggle that required strategy as well as bravery. However, Captain Broome was not through with Jim as we shall soon see.  \"Well, Jim,\" said Ketchel finally, as he pushed his chair back from the table, and took a quick look at his watch, \"the train you pass here is due in ten minutes and then you will be pulling out. Let's go outside; it's a bit too warm in here to suit me.\"  \"All right, Bob, the fresh air will seem good to both of us.\"  As they stopped at the office just outside the dining-room door, there was a moment's friendly rivalry to see who should settle for the breakfast but Ketchel winked at the clerk behind the circular counter with its usual cigar case, and porcupine arrangement of toothpicks. \"His money is no good, Sam,\" he asserted, \"when he's traveling in my company.\"  \"You're the judge, Bob,\" said the clerk. \"I hear you and your friend were held up in Bear Valley last night, together with the train you were toting along. How about it?\"  \"I'll tell you later, Sam. Jim here is leaving on No. 7 and we are old pals and have got some talking yet.\"  \"I see!\" acquiesced Sam. \"Good luck to you,\" and he nodded good humoredly to Jim. The two"]]]
