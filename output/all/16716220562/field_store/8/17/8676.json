I know not why         I could not die,[20]     I had no earthly hope--but faith,     And that forbade a selfish death.                                  230                          IX.      What next befell me then and there       I know not well--I never knew--     First came the loss of light, and air,       And then of darkness too:     I had no thought, no feeling--none--     Among the stones I stood a stone,[21]     And was, scarce conscious what I wist,     As shrubless crags within the mist;     For all was blank, and bleak, and grey;     It was not night--it was not day;                                  240     It was not even the dungeon-light,     So hateful to my heavy sight,     But vacancy absorbing space,     And fixedness--without a place;     There were no stars--no earth--no time--     No check--no change--no good--no crime--     But silence, and a stirless breath     Which neither was of life nor death;     A sea of stagnant idleness,     Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!                            250                          X.      A light broke in upon my brain,--       It was the carol of a bird;     It ceased, and then it came again,       The sweetest song ear ever heard,     And mine was thankful till my eyes     Ran over with the glad surprise,     And they that moment could not see     I was the mate of misery;     But then by dull degrees came back     My senses to their wonted track;                                   260     I saw the dungeon walls and floor     Close slowly round me as before,     I saw the glimmer of the sun     Creeping as it before had done,     But through the crevice where it came     That bird was perched, as fond and tame,       And tamer than upon the tree;     A lovely bird, with azure wings,[22]     And song that said a thousand things,       And seemed to say them all for me!                               270     I never saw its like before,     I ne'er shall see its likeness more:     It seemed like me to want a mate,     But was not half so desolate,[23]     And it was come to love me when     None lived to love me so again,     And cheering from my dungeon's brink,     Had brought me back to feel and think.     I know not if it late were free,       Or broke its cage to perch on mine,                              280     But knowing well captivity,       Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!     Or if it were, in wingéd guise,     A visitant from Paradise;     For--Heaven forgive that thought! the while     Which made me both to weep and smile--     I sometimes deemed that it might be     My brother's soul come down to me;[24]     But then at last away it flew,     And then 'twas mortal well I knew,                                 290     For he would never thus have flown--     And left me twice so doubly lone,--     Lone--as the corse within its shroud,     Lone--as a solitary cloud,[25]       A single cloud on a sunny day,     While all the rest of heaven is clear,     A frown upon the atmosphere,     That hath no business to appear[26]       When skies are blue, and earth is gay.                          XI.      A kind of change came in my fate,                                  300     My keepers grew compassionate;     I know not what had made them so,     They were inured to sights of woe,     But so it was:--my broken chain     With links unfastened did remain,     And it was liberty to stride     Along my cell from side to side,     And up and down, and then athwart,     And tread it over every part;     And round the pillars one by one,                                  310     Returning where my walk begun,     Avoiding only, as I trod,     My brothers' graves without a sod;     For if I thought with heedless tread     My step profaned their lowly bed,     My breath came gaspingly and thick,     And my crushed heart felt blind and sick.                          XII.      I made a footing in the wall,       It was not therefrom to escape,     For I had buried one and all,                                      320       Who loved me in a human shape;     And the whole earth would henceforth be     A wider prison unto me:[27]     No child--no sire--no kin had I,     No partner in my misery;     I thought of this, and I was glad,     For thought of them had made me mad;     But I was curious to ascend     To my barred windows, and to bend     Once more, upon the mountains high,                                330     The quiet of a loving eye.[28]                          XIII.      I saw them--and they were the same,     They were not changed like me in frame;     I saw their thousand years of snow     On high--their wide long lake below,[g]     And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;[29]     I heard the torrents leap and gush     O'er channelled rock and broken bush;     I saw the white-walled distant town,[30]     And whiter sails go skimming down;                                 340     And then there was a little isle,[31]     Which in my very face did smile,       The only one in view;     A small green isle, it seemed no more,[32]     Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,     But in it there were three tall trees,     And o'er it blew the mountain breeze,     And by it there were waters flowing,     And on it there were young flowers growing,       Of gentle breath and hue.                                        350     The fish swam by the castle wall,     And they seemed joyous each and all;[33]     The eagle rode the rising blast,     Methought he never flew so fast     As then to me he seemed to fly;     And then new tears came in my eye,     And I felt troubled--and would fain     I had not left my recent chain;     And when I did descend again,     The darkness of my dim abode                                       360     Fell on me as a heavy load;     It was as is a new-dug grave,     Closing o'er one we sought to save,--     And yet my glance, too much opprest,     Had almost need of such a rest.                          XIV.      It might be months, or years, or days--       I kept no count, I took no note--     I had no hope my eyes to raise,       And clear them of their dreary mote;     At last men came to set me free;                                   370       I asked not why, and recked not where;     It was at length the same to me,     Fettered or fetterless to be,       I learned to love despair.     And thus when they appeared at last,     And all my bonds aside were cast,     These heavy walls to me had grown     A hermitage--and all my own![34]     And half I felt as they were come     To tear me from a second home:                                     380     With spiders I had friendship made,     And watched them in their sullen trade,     Had seen the mice by moonlight play,     And why should I feel less than they?     We were all inmates of one place,     And I, the monarch of each race,     Had power to kill--yet, strange to tell!     In quiet we had learned to dwell;[h]     My very chains and I grew friends,     So much a long communion tends                                     390     To make us what we are:--even I     Regained my freedom with a sigh.

Hachette, 1876, I. iii. pp. 123-131) describes this ... 'Le phénomène de la grotto d'azur s'accomplit dans le souterrain de Chillon, et le lac de Genève n'y réussit pas moins bien que la Méditerranée.'

The fifth column is said to be the one to which Bonivard was chained during four years. Byron's name is carved on the southern side of the third column ... on the seventh tympanum, at about 1 metre 45 from the lower edge of the shaft.\" Much has been written for and against the authenticity of this inscription, which, according to M.

On its left are the entrances of the Rhone, and opposite are the heights of Meillerie and the range of Alps above Boveret and St. Gingo. Near it, on a hill behind, is a torrent: below it, washing its walls, the lake has been fathomed to the depth of 800 feet, French measure: within it are a range of dungeons, in which the early reformers, and subsequently prisoners of state, were confined. Across one of the vaults is a beam black with age, on which we were informed that the condemned were formerly executed. In the cells are seven pillars, or, rather, eight, one being half merged in the wall; in some of these are rings for the fetters and the fettered: in the pavement the steps of Bonnivard have left their traces. He was confined here several years. It is by this castle that Rousseau has fixed the catastrophe of his Héloïse, in the rescue of one of her children by Julie from the water; the shock of which, and the illness produced by the immersion, is the cause of her death. The château is large, and seen along the lake for a great distance. The walls are white.  [\"Le château de Chillon ... est situé dans le lac sur un rocher qui forme une presqu'isle, et autour du quel j'ai vu sonder à plus de cent cinquante brasses qui font près de huit cents pieds, sans trouver le fond. On a creusé dans ce rocher des caves et des cuisines au-dessous du niveau de l'eau, qu'on y introduit, quand on veut, par des robinets. C'est-là que fut détenu six ans prisonnier François Bonnivard ... homme d'un mérite rare, d'une droiture et d'une fermeté à toute épreuve, ami de la liberté, quoique Savoyard, et tolérant quoique prêtre,\" etc. (_La Nouvelle Héloïse_, par J. J. Rousseau, partie vi. Lettre 8, note (1); _Oeuvres complètes_, 1836, ii. 356, note 1).  With Byron's description of Chillon, compare that of Shelley, contained in a letter to Peacock, dated July 12, 1816 (_Prose Works of P. B. Shelley_, 1880, ii. 171, sq.). The belief or tradition that Bonivard's prison is \"below the surface of the lake,\" for which Shelley as well as Rousseau is responsible, but which Byron only records in verse, may be traced to a statement attributed to Bonivard himself, who says (_Mémoires, etc._, 1843, iv. 268) that the commandant thrust him \"en unes croctes desquelles le fond estoit plus bas que le lac sur lequel Chillon estoit citue.\" As a matter of fact, \"the level [of _les souterrains_] is now three metres higher than the level of the water, and even if we take off the difference arising from the fact that the level of the lake was once much higher, and that the floor of the halls has been raised, still the halls must originally have been built about two metres above the surface of the lake.\"--_Guide_, etc., pp. 28, 29.]  [13] {19}[The \"real Bonivard\" might have indulged in and, perhaps, prided himself on this feeble and irritating _paronomasy_; but nothing can be less in keeping with the bearing and behaviour of the tragic and sententious Bonivard of the legend.]  [14] [Compare--        \"...I'm a forester and breather     Of the steep mountain-tops.\"                                                   _Werner_, act iv. sc. 1.]  [e] _But why withhold the blow?--he died_.

Coleridge, part ii. lines 412, 413.]  [17] [It is said that his parents handed him over to the care of his uncle, Jean-Aimé Bonivard, when he was still an infant, and it is denied that his father was \"literally put to death.\"]  [18] {21}[Kölbing quotes parallel uses of the same expression in _Werner_, act iv. sc. 1; Churchill's _The Times_, line 341, etc.; but does not give the original--      \"But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,     Than that which, withering on the virgin-thorn,\" etc.                     _Midsummer Night's Dream_, act i. sc. i, lines 76, 77.]  [19] [Compare--      \"The first, last look of Death revealed.\"                                              _The Giaour_, line 89, note 2.  Byron was a connoisseur of the incidents and by-play of \"sudden death,\" so much so that Goethe was under the impression that he had been guilty of a venial murder (see his review of _Manfred_ in his paper _Kunst and Alterthum_, _Letters_, 1901, v. 506, 507). A year after these lines were written, when he was at Rome (Letter to Murray, May 30, 1817), he saw three robbers guillotined, and observed himself and them from a psychological standpoint.  \"The ghastly bed of Sin\" (lines 182, 183) may be a reminiscence of the death-bed of Lord Falkland (_English Bards_, etc., lines 680-686; _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 351, note 2).]  [20] {22}[Compare--      \"And yet I could not die.\"                                      _Ancient Mariner_, Part IV. line 262.]  [21] {23}[Compare--      \"I wept not; so all stone I felt within.\"                        Dante's _Inferno_, xxxiii. 47 (Cary's translation).]  [22] {24}[Compare \"Song by Glycine\"--      \"A sunny shaft did I behold,        From sky to earth it slanted;     And poised therein a bird so bold--        Sweet bird, thou wert enchanted,\" etc.                              _Zapolya_, by S.
