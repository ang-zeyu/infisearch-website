LADYBUG LEAVES XXIII     BACK AGAIN  XXIV     MRS. GREEN'S MISTAKE       THE TALE OF MRS. LADYBUG  I  THE POLKA DOT LADY   LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug was a worker. Nobody could deny that. To be sure, she had to stop now and then to talk to her neighbors, because Mrs. Ladybug dearly loved a bit of gossip. At the same time there wasn't anyone in Pleasant Valley that helped Farmer Green more than she did. She tried her hardest to keep the trees in the orchard free from insects.  Some of her less worthy neighbors were known sometimes to say with a sniff, \"If Mrs. Ladybug didn't enjoy her work she wouldn't care about helping Farmer Green. If she hadn't such a big appetite she'd stop to chat even more than she does now.\"  That might seem an odd remark--unless one happened to know how Mrs. Ladybug freed the orchard of the tiny pests that attacked it. The truth of the matter was this: Mrs. Ladybug _ate_ the little insects that fed upon the fruit trees. Her constant toil meant that she devoured huge numbers of Farmer Green's enemies.  Goodness knows what Farmer Green would have done had Mrs. Ladybug and all her family lost their taste for that kind of fare. The orchard might have been a sorry sight.  Perhaps it was only to be expected that Mrs. Ladybug should have little patience with folk that seemed lazy. She thought that Freddie Firefly wasted too much of his time dancing in the meadow at night. She considered Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son, to be a useless idler, dressed in his black velvet and gold. Having heard that Daddy Longlegs was a harvestman, she urged him to go to work for Farmer Green at harvest time. And as for the beautiful Betsy Butterfly, Mrs. Ladybug found all manner of fault with her.  Nothing made Mrs. Ladybug angrier than to see Betsy Butterfly flitting from flower to flower in the sunshine, followed by her admirers.  \"What _can_ they see in that gaudy creature?\" Mrs. Ladybug often asked her friends.  It will appear, from this, that Mrs. Ladybug was not always as pleasant as she might have been. Moreover, she was something of a busybody and too fond of prying into the affairs of others. And if she didn't happen to approve of her neighbors, or their ways, Mrs. Ladybug never hesitated to speak her mind.  When she first appeared on Farmer Green's place, wearing her bright red gown with its black spots, everyone supposed that Mrs. Ladybug was dressed in her working clothes. And indeed she was! Nor did she ever don any other.  \"I've no time to fritter away,\" she declared when somebody asked her what she was going to wear to Betsy Butterfly's party. \"If I go to the party I'll just drop in for a few minutes as I am, in my polka dot.\"  Her neighbors thought that very strange. They even whispered to one another that they didn't believe Mrs. Ladybug had anything else to wear.  Nor had she. Nor did she want any. And it wasn't long before everybody understood Mrs. Ladybug's ways. She was so earnest that they couldn't help liking her, no matter if her remarks were a bit tart now and then.     II  BUSTER'S RESOLVE   NOT only was Betsy Butterfly a beautiful creature. She was pleasant to everybody. And almost all her neighbors were just as pleasant to her. Mrs. Ladybug was one of the few that were sometimes disagreeable to Betsy. For Mrs. Ladybug did not approve of her. She thought that Betsy Butterfly was frivolous. And she frowned whenever she saw Betsy in her beautiful costume.  \"She _never_ wears working clothes,\" Mrs. Ladybug often complained, when talking to her friends. \"Now, if Betsy Butterfly would only wear something plain and serviceable, as I do, once in a while, people might have a different opinion of her. She ought to try this hard-finished red and black polka dot of mine. It's a wonderful piece of goods.\"  One day Mrs. Ladybug was gossiping in that fashion with Mehitable Moth, a soberly clad person who was always a bit jealous of the gorgeous Betsy. And Mehitable Moth nodded her head to everything that little Mrs. Ladybug said.  \"What do you think of Betsy Butterfly's wings?\" Miss Moth inquired.  \"They're all for show,\" Mrs. Ladybug declared. \"They're so flimsy and delicate that Betsy Butterfly never dares venture out in bad weather. Of what use would I be to Farmer Green if I had wings like hers? If I stayed under cover whenever the sun didn't shine, the orchard would soon be overrun with insects.\"  Now, it happened that Buster Bumblebee was sipping nectar from a head of clover near by. Of course, he wasn't listening to what Mrs. Ladybug and Miss Moth were saying. But he couldn't help hearing their remarks. And being a great admirer of Betsy Butterfly, he wasn't at all pleased. He even buzzed near the two gossipers and said to them, \"Can't you find something else to talk about?\"  \"Such rudeness!\" Mrs. Ladybug gasped.  \"What shocking manners!\" cried Miss Mehitable Moth.  They hoped that Buster Bumblebee heard what they said. Anyhow, he flew off in his blundering, clumsy way without speaking to them again.  \"Who is this Mrs. Ladybug, to pick flaws in the beautiful Betsy Butterfly?\" he asked himself savagely. \"Who is she to find fault with Betsy's lovely wings? If Mrs. Ladybug herself had wings, I shouldn't think her chatter so strange. But a person with no wings has no business expressing his views of somebody else's.\"  Buster Bumblebee was so out of patience with Mrs. Ladybug that he lost his taste for clover heads for the rest of the afternoon. And that was a most unusual thing with him. However, he could think of nothing but Mrs. Ladybug and her unkind speeches. And at last, meeting Betsy Butterfly herself along towards sunset, he stopped to tell how well she was looking and how charming her colors were.  Betsy Butterfly was not vain. She laughed gayly and said, \"You're very kind to say those agreeable things.\"  \"I can't help it,\" he replied heartily.  \"Everybody's not like you,\" Betsy Butterfly told him.  \"Then you've been hearing about Mrs. Ladybug!\" he cried. \"Somebody has been tattling.\"  \"It doesn't matter,\" Betsy Butterfly assured him. \"Perhaps it's good for me to know that everyone doesn't admire me.\"  Buster Bumblebee didn't agree with her.  \"I'll have to speak to Mrs. Ladybug,\" he declared.  \"Oh, don't!\" Betsy Butterfly begged him; for she was as gentle as she was beautiful and never wanted people to quarrel on her account.  But Buster Bumblebee had made up his mind and nothing could change it.     III  HIDDEN WINGS   THE next day Buster Bumblebee set out for the orchard to find Mrs. Ladybug. He wanted to warn her to stop talking about Betsy Butterfly. But Buster hadn't realized that it was not an easy matter to say anything to Mrs. Ladybug. Mrs. Ladybug always liked to do most of the talking herself. She preferred to let others listen.  He found her hard at work destroying insects on an old apple tree. And when she caught sight of him Mrs. Ladybug paused in her labors.  \"Well, young man!\" she exclaimed, looking at Buster severely. \"Are you idling this lovely day away? You don't seem to be making any honey.\"  Buster wished that he had spoken first. He certainly had had no intention of discussing such matters as honey making.  \"I don't need to make honey,\" he told Mrs. Ladybug. \"The workers in our hive provide honey enough. Maybe you didn't know that I'm of royal blood. I'm the Queen's son. I don't have to work,\" he declared somewhat hotly.  \"Rubbish!\" cried Mrs. Ladybug, regarding him with a frown. \"Go get yourself some working clothes! Take off your black velvet and gold! And save that suit for best!\"  \"You don't understand,\" Buster tried to explain. \"Being a Queen's son, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20097"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Ladybug (#1)"],["body","I'm expected to wear my court costume every day.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Mrs. Ladybug retorted. \"The sooner you get such silly notions out of your head, the better off you'll be. Everybody ought to work. Too much play is bad for folks.\"  Buster Bumblebee could feel himself flushing. The neighbors were not expected to address a Queen's son in that fashion.  \"That's exactly the way you talk about Betsy Butterfly!\" he exploded.  \"Huh!\" Mrs. Ladybug sniffed. \"You are a worthless pair. Betsy Butterfly's wings--\"  At this point Buster managed to interrupt her.  \"Don't talk about wings, please!\" he cried. \"Who are you, to talk about wings?--when you haven't any yourself.\"  Mrs. Ladybug started; and she gave him a queer look. \"What's that?\" she inquired. \"What's that? Say that again!\"  \"You haven't any wings.\"  \"Ho!\" she laughed. \"You're mistaken. I _have_ wings.\"  \"Then you've left them at home,\" he insisted.  Mrs. Ladybug smiled a very knowing sort of smile. When he saw it Buster Bumblebee couldn't help feeling uncomfortable. Somehow he knew that he had blundered. But just where he had erred he was unable to decide.  \"Watch sharp, young sir!\" Mrs. Ladybug bade him. \"Watch sharp and perhaps you'll be able to learn something.\"  Then Buster Bumblebee received the surprise of his life. As he watched, little Mrs. Ladybug opened her shell-like, black-dotted, red back and spread a pair of delicate brown wings.  \"See these?\" she said to Buster Bumblebee, who gasped at her blankly. \"I've really _two_ pairs of wings, because my polka dot wing covers are actually wings too--only folks don't usually call them by that name.\"  Having spread her wings, Mrs. Ladybug decided to take a short flight. And with Buster gazing dully after her she flitted off.  \"I'll have to tell my mother, the Queen, about this,\" he muttered.     IV  RUSTY WREN HELPS   RUSTY WREN'S wife was getting very impatient. She was at home with her fast-growing family of youngsters, at home in the cherry tree near Farmer Green's chamber window.  \"Dear me!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed. \"I don't see what's keeping Rusty. It's at least a quarter of an hour since he brought any food to these children.\"  Mrs. Wren soon grew tired of waiting.  \"I'll go and find him!\" she said under her breath. And telling her nestlings that she would be back in a few minutes, she hurried off towards the orchard.  \"I thought so!\" Mrs. Wren muttered soon afterward, as she caught sight of her husband. He was talking with Jolly Robin, in the old apple tree where the Robin family lived. \"I thought so!\"  \"Have you forgotten your duty as a parent?\" Mrs. Wren asked her husband in a tart voice, dropping down on a branch right behind him.  Rusty Wren jumped.  \"I've been here only a second or two,\" he faltered. \"Mr. Robin and I had a little business together.\"  \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Wren. \"So I see. And now, if your business is finished, allow me to remind you that you have six hungry sons and daughters at home.\" Then Mrs. Wren twitched herself off her perch and flew back to the cherry tree and her family.  \"I declare,\" Rusty Wren remarked to his friend Jolly Robin, \"I must have stayed here, talking with you, longer than I thought. Those children have enormous appetites. I'll have to work more spryly than ever to get them fed before sunset.\"  \"I know how that is,\" said Jolly Robin with a chuckle. Somehow he seemed much more cheerful than his companion. \"I was actually glad when our last nestlings were big enough to leave home and hustle for themselves. But, of course,\" he added, \"I still keep an eye on them.\"  Rusty Wren had already begun to hunt for tidbits. Almost immediately he found an ant, which he snatched up and carried away. Back and forth he flew, making dozens of trips between his house and the orchard. Grubs and caterpillars, grasshoppers and spiders--he seized them wherever he could spy them and took them home to his famishing children.  Though he worked his hardest, Mrs. Wren hadn't a smile for him. And when she said anything in his hearing, it was some such remark as this: \"You poor, hungry dears! It's a pity you can't have all you need to eat. I only hope your scanty meals won't stunt your growth.\"  Naturally such speeches didn't make her husband feel any more at his ease.  \"I'll have to bring home something special, to please her,\" he thought. \"I wish I could find some dainty that would put her in better humor.\"  So he looked all around to see what he could discover that was different from the food he had been gathering. And it wasn't long before he gave a chirp of delight. \"Here's a pretty beetle!\" he cried. \"I know it will make Mrs. Wren smile when I show it to her.\"  Thereupon Rusty Wren pounced upon Mrs. Ladybug and bore her away, struggling, in his bill.     V  A HARD SHELL   RUSTY WREN hurried home, carrying Mrs. Ladybug despite her frantic efforts to escape. She wriggled all her six legs at the same time.  \"She'll be pleased with this one,\" Rusty murmured, as he watched Mrs. Ladybug's struggles. \"Mrs. Wren will certainly thank me when I give her this morsel.\"  And she did.  \"How lovely!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed when Rusty gave her his captive.  And he was so glad that he hastened away to try to find another just like that one. But he hadn't gone far before he said, \"Ugh! I hope I haven't made a mistake. I don't like the taste of that beetle.\" And he dropped down upon the ground and carefully wiped his bill upon the grass.  He couldn't help feeling somewhat worried.  \"I don't believe the children will notice anything wrong,\" he muttered. \"So far, they've never refused anything that was offered them. But if Mrs. Wren tried to eat that beetle herself, I fear there'll be trouble.\"  And there was. Rusty knew it a few minutes later, when little Mr. Chippy's son, Chippy, Jr., came flitting up and peeped in his childish voice, \"Please, sir, Mrs. Wren wants you at once.\"  There was nothing to do except to go home. And Rusty went.  He found Mrs. Wren much upset.  \"Are you trying to poison us?\" she demanded.  \"No, indeed--my love!\" Rusty Wren replied meekly.  \"Well, you made a terrible mistake, then,\" she declared.  Meanwhile Rusty Wren was looking all around. Yet he couldn't see the pretty beetle (meaning Mrs. Ladybug) anywhere. \"Somebody must have swallowed it, anyhow,\" he thought.  \"You must be more careful,\" his wife told him severely. \"That was a horrid-tasting beetle that you brought home. It's lucky I discovered that it was a queer one. The children--poor dears!--are so hungry that any one of them would have bolted it had I offered it to him.\"  \"Then you ate it yourself,\" Rusty Wren faltered.  \"Oh, no, I didn't,\" said his wife. \"I dropped it upon the ground. And no doubt I'd have thrown it away, anyhow, no matter how it tasted.\"  \"Why?\" he asked her. \"I thought it was a pretty beetle.\"  \"It was pretty enough--I dare say,\" Mrs. Wren replied. \"But it had a very hard shell. It wouldn't have been safe to feed it to the children. Nor should I have cared to eat it myself.\"  \"I thought it was a pretty beetle,\" Rusty said again. \"It was such a gay color--bright red, you know. It seemed to me it would please the children, and you, too.\"  Mrs. Wren still seemed to be somewhat out of patience.  \"When you gather food for the youngsters, never mind about the color of it!\" she exclaimed. \"If you want to bring them playthings, that's another matter. But don't fetch home any more pretty red beetles for them to eat.\"  \"Very well--my love!\" said Rusty Wren. And then he slipped away to hunt for food, because the children were still clamoring for more.  Mrs. Wren talked a good deal, afterward, about her terrible experience. Yet she never stopped to think about the pretty beetle--about little Mrs. Ladybug. For Mrs. Ladybug had had a dreadful fright. Luckily she wasn't hurt. But it was a long time before she was her usual busy, able self again. And later, when she told her friends about her adventure, she said that she couldn't understand how Rusty came to make such a mistake.  \"I supposed,\" Mrs. Ladybug declared, \"that every bird in Pleasant Valley knew I wasn't good to eat.\"     VI  THE TRAVELER   FARMER GREEN'S garden was growing fast. The sweet corn waved and rustled whenever a breeze swept it. The beets and carrots sent their pert tops a little higher each day. The cabbages began to puff their heads out as if they felt of some importance in the world. And the potato vines were actually pretty, with their white blossoms amid the green leaves. Farmer Green was very proud of his potatoes. He said, in Mrs. Ladybug's hearing, that they were the best he had ever raised.  \"I must fly over to the garden and have a look at those potatoes,\" Mrs. Ladybug thought. \"It's always a pleasure to see flourishing crops.\"  Before she found time to spare for her visit to the garden a traveler entered the orchard one day. At least, he had every appearance of having come from other parts. For he carried a traveling bag--an old-fashioned carpetbag--and he seemed to have lost his way.  As soon as Mrs. Ladybug saw him she couldn't help thinking what a handsome person he was. He wore a yellow coat. And instead of being spotted with black, as her gown was, it was striped.  \"Good morning!\" said the stranger.  \"Good morning!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"Can I be of any service to you?\"  The stranger took off his cap. He was a most polite chap.  \"Perhaps you can help me,\" he replied.  \"I'm looking for Farmer Green's vegetable garden. Do you know where it is?\"  \"Indeed I do!\" Mrs. Ladybug cried. \"It's at the end of this orchard, just beyond the fence.\"  \"And the potato patch--I suppose I'll have no trouble finding that?\" the stranger went on.  \"Follow your nose!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"You're headed right for it now.\"  The stranger thanked her. And he was about to move on. But of course Mrs. Ladybug wanted to talk more than that before he got away.  \"The potatoes are fine this season,\" she remarked.  The stranger looked greatly pleased.  \"That's good news,\""]]]
