Aunty doesn't want me to be a soldier for fear of being killed.\"  \"Bless my life! Would she have you get into a feather-bed and stay there? Why, you might be killed by a thunderbolt, if you were a butter-merchant!\"  \"So I might. I shall tell her so. What a funny fellow you are, sir! I say, do you think my father knew the Gipsy's secret? The Postman says he used to whisper to his black mare.\"  \"Your father was taught to ride as a child, by one of those horsemen of the East who swoop and dart and wheel about a plain like swallows in autumn. Grandson! Love me a little too. I can tell you more about your father than the Postman can.\"  \"I do love you,\" said Jackanapes. \"Before you came I was frightened. I'd no notion you were so nice.\"  \"Love me always, boy, whatever I do or leave undone. And--GOD help me--whatever you do or leave undone, I'll love you! There shall never be a cloud between us for a day; no, sir, not for an hour. We're imperfect enough, all of us, we needn't be so bitter; and life is uncertain enough at its safest, we needn't waste its opportunities. Look at me! Here sit I, after a dozen battles and some of the worst climates in the world, and by yonder lych gate lies your mother, who didn't move five miles, I suppose, from your aunt's apron-strings,--dead in her teens; my golden-haired daughter, whom I never saw.\"  Jackanapes was terribly troubled.  \"Don't cry, grandfather,\" he pleaded, his own blue eyes round with tears. \"I will love you very much, and I will try to be very good. But I should like to be a soldier.\"  \"You shall, my boy, you shall. You've more claims for a commission than you know of. Cavalry, I suppose; eh, ye young Jackanapes? Well, well; if you live to be an honor to your country, this old-heart shall grow young again with pride for you; and if you die in the service of your country--GOD bless me, it can but break for ye!\"  And beating the region which he said was all waistcoats, as if they stifled him, the old man got up and strode out on to the Green.     CHAPTER IV.       \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his      life for his friends.\"--JOHN XV. 13.   Twenty and odd years later the Grey Goose was still alive, and in full possession of her faculties, such as they were. She lived slowly and carefully, and she lived long. So did Miss Jessamine; but the General was dead.  He had lived on the Green for many years, during which he and the Postman saluted each other with a punctiliousness that it almost drilled one to witness. He would have completely spoiled Jackanapes if Miss Jessamine's conscience would have let him; otherwise he somewhat dragooned his neighbors, and was as positive about parish matters as a ratepayer about the army. A stormy-tempered, tender-hearted soldier, irritable with the suffering of wounds of which he never spoke, whom all the village followed to his grave with tears.  The General's death was a great shock to Miss Jessamine, and her nephew stayed with her for some little time after the funeral. Then he was obliged to join his regiment, which was ordered abroad.  One effect of the conquest which the General had gained over the affections of the village, was a considerable abatement of the popular prejudice against \"the military.\" Indeed the village was now somewhat importantly represented in the army. There was the General himself, and the Postman, and the Black Captain's tablet in the church, and Jackanapes, and Tony Johnson, and a Trumpeter.  [Illustration]  Tony Johnson had no more natural taste for fighting than for riding, but he was as devoted as ever to Jackanapes, and that was how it came about that Mr. Johnson bought him a commission in the same cavalry regiment that the General's grandson (whose commission had been given him by the Iron Duke) was in, and that he was quite content to be the butt of the mess where Jackanapes was the hero; and that when Jackanapes wrote home to Miss Jessamine, Tony wrote with the same purpose to his mother; namely, to demand her congratulations that they were on active service at last, and were ordered to the front. And he added a postscript to the effect that she could have no idea how popular Jackanapes was, nor how splendidly he rode the wonderful red charger whom he had named after his old friend Lollo.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Sound Retire!\"  A Boy Trumpeter, grave with the weight of responsibilities and accoutrements beyond his years, and stained, so that his own mother would not have known him, with the sweat and dust of battle, did as he was bid; and then pushing his trumpet pettishly aside, adjusted his weary legs for the hundredth time to the horse which was a world too big for him, and muttering, \"'Tain't a pretty tune,\" tried to see something of this, his first engagement, before it came to an end.  Being literally in the thick of it, he could hardly have seen less or known less of what happened in that particular skirmish if he had been at home in England. For many good reasons; including dust and smoke, and that what attention he dared distract from his commanding officer was pretty well absorbed by keeping his hard-mouthed troop-horse in hand, under pain of execration by his neighbors in the m瘭嶪. By-and-by, when the newspapers came out, if he could get a look at one before it was thumbed to bits, he would learn that the enemy had appeared from ambush in overwhelming numbers, and that orders had been given to fall back, which was done slowly and in good order, the men fighting as they retired.  Born and bred on the Goose Green, the youngest of Mr. Johnson's gardener's numerous off-spring, the boy had given his family \"no peace\" till they let him \"go for a soldier\" with Master Tony and Master Jackanapes. They consented at last, with more tears than they shed when an elder son was sent to jail for poaching, and the boy was perfectly happy in his life, and full of _esprit de corps_. It was this which had been wounded by having to sound retreat for \"the young gentlemen's regiment,\" the first time he served with it before the enemy, and he was also harassed by having completely lost sight of Master Tony. There had been some hard fighting before the backward movement began, and he had caught sight of him once, but not since. On the other hand, all the pulses of his village pride had been stirred by one or two visions of Master Jackanapes whirling about on his wonderful horse. He had been easy to distinguish, since an eccentric blow had bared his head without hurting it, for his close golden mop of hair gleamed in the hot sunshine as brightly as the steel of the sword flashing round it.  Of the missiles that fell pretty thickly, the Boy Trumpeter did not take much notice. First, one can't attend to everything, and his hands were full. Secondly, one gets used to anything. Thirdly, experience soon teaches one, in spite of proverbs, how very few bullets find their billet. Far more unnerving is the mere suspicion of fear or even of anxiety in the human mass around you. The Boy was beginning to wonder if there were any dark reason for the increasing pressure, and whether they would be allowed to move back more quickly, when the smoke in front lifted for a moment, and he could see the plain, and the enemy's line some two hundred yards away.  [Illustration]  And across the plain between them, he saw Master Jackanapes galloping alone at the top of Lollo's speed, their faces to the enemy, his golden head at Lollo's ear.  But at this moment noise and smoke seemed to burst out on every side, the officer shouted to him to sound retire, and between trumpeting and bumping about on his horse, he saw and heard no more of the incidents of his first battle.  Tony Johnson was always unlucky with horses, from the days of the giddy-go-round onwards. On this day--of all days in the year--his own horse was on the sick list, and he had to ride an inferior, ill-conditioned beast, and fell off that, at the very moment when it was a matter of life or death to be able to ride away. The horse fell on him, but struggled up again, and Tony managed to keep hold of it. It was in trying to remount that he discovered, by helplessness and anguish, that one of his legs was crushed and broken, and that no feat of which he was master would get him into the saddle. Not able even to stand alone, awkwardly, agonizingly unable to mount his restive horse, his life was yet so strong within him! And on one side of him rolled the dust and smoke-cloud of his advancing foe, and on the other, that which covered his retreating friends.  He turned one piteous gaze after them, with a bitter twinge, not of reproach, but of loneliness; and then, dragging himself up by the side of his horse, he turned the other way and drew out his pistol, and waited for the end. Whether he waited seconds or minutes he never knew, before some one gripped him by the arm.  \"_Jackanapes_! _GOD bless you_! It's my left leg. If you could get me on--\"  It was like Tony's luck that his pistol went off at his horse's tail, and made it plunge; but Jackanapes threw him across the saddle.  \"Hold on anyhow, and stick your spur in. I'll lead him. Keep your head down, they're firing high.\"  And Jackanapes laid his head down--to Lollo's ear.  It was when they were fairly off, that a sudden upspringing of the enemy in all directions had made it necessary to change the gradual retirement of our force into as rapid a retreat as possible. And when Jackanapes became aware of this, and felt the lagging and swerving of Tony's horse, he began to wish he had thrown his friend across his own saddle, and left their lives to Lollo.  When Tony became aware of it, several things came into his head. 1. That the dangers of their ride for life were now more than doubled. 2. That if Jackanapes and Lollo were not burdened with him they would undoubtedly escape. 3. That"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20351"],["title","Jackanapes (#5)"],["body","pes' life was infinitely valuable, and his--Tony's--was not. 4. That this--if he could seize it--was the supremest of all the moments in which he had tried to assume the virtues which Jackanapes had by nature; and that if he could be courageous and unselfish now--  He caught at his own reins and spoke very loud--  \"Jackanapes! It won't do. You and Lollo must go on. Tell the fellows I gave you back to them, with all my heart. Jackanapes, if you love me, leave me!\"  There was a daffodil light over the evening sky in front of them, and it shone strangely on Jackanapes' hair and face. He turned with an odd look in his eyes that a vainer man than Tony Johnson might have taken for brotherly pride. Then he shook his mop and laughed at him.  \"_Leave you?_ To save my skin? No, Tony, not to save my soul!\"     CHAPTER V.       Mr. VALIANT _summoned. His will. His last words._       Then, said he, \"I am going to my Father's.... My Sword I      give to him that shall succeed me in my Pilgrimage, and my      Courage and Skill to him that can get it.\" ... And as he      went down deeper, he said, \"Grave, where is thy Victory?\"       So he passed over, and all the Trumpets sounded for him on      the other side.  BUNYAN'S _Pilgrim's, Progress_.   Coming out of a hospital-tent, at headquarters, the surgeon cannonaded against, and rebounded from, another officer; a sallow man, not young, with a face worn more by ungentle experiences than by age; with weary eyes that kept their own counsel, iron gray hair, and a moustache that was as if a raven had laid its wing across his lips and sealed them.  \"Well?\"  \"Beg pardon, Major. Didn't see you. Oh, compound fracture and bruises, but it's all right. He'll pull through.\"  \"Thank GOD.\"  It was probably an involuntary expression, for prayer and praise were not much in the Major's line, as a jerk of the surgeon's head would have betrayed to an observer. He was a bright little man, with his feelings showing all over him, but with gallantry and contempt of death enough for both sides of his profession; who took a cool head, a white handkerchief and a case of instruments, where other men went hot-blooded with weapons, and who was the biggest gossip, male or female, of the regiment. Not even the Major's taciturnity daunted him.  \"Didn't think he'd as much pluck about him as he has. He'll do all right if he doesn't fret himself into a fever about poor Jackanapes.\"  \"Whom are you talking about?\" asked the Major hoarsely.  \"Young Johnson. He--\"  \"What about Jackanapes?\"  \"Don't you know? Sad business. Rode back for Johnson, and brought him in; but, monstrous ill-luck, hit as they rode. Left lung--\"  \"Will he recover?\"  \"No. Sad business.\" \"What a frame--what limbs--what health--and what good looks? Finest young fellow--\"  \"Where is he?\"  \"In his own tent,\" said the surgeon sadly.  The Major wheeled and left him.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Can I do anything else for you?\"  \"Nothing, thank you. Except--Major! I wish I could get you to appreciate Johnson.\"  \"This is not an easy moment, Jackanapes.\"  \"Let me tell you, sir--_he_ never will--that if he could have driven me from him, he would be lying yonder at this moment, and I should be safe and sound.\"  The Major laid his hand over his mouth, as if to keep back a wish he would have been ashamed to utter.  \"I've known old Tony from a child. He's a fool on impulse, a good man and a gentleman in principle. And he acts on principle, which it's not every--some water, please! Thank you, sir. It's very hot, and yet one's feet get uncommonly cold. Oh, thank you, thank you. He's no fire-eater, but he has a trained conscience and a tender heart, and he'll do his duty when a braver and more selfish man might fail you. But he wants encouragement; and when I'm gone--\"  \"He shall have encouragement. You have my word for it. Can I do nothing else?\"  \"Yes, Major. A favor.\"  \"Thank you, Jackanapes.\"  \"Be Lollo's master, and love him as well as you can. He's used to it.\"  \"Wouldn't you rather Johnson had him?\"  The blue eyes twinkled in spite of mortal pain.  \"Tony _rides_ on principle, Major. His legs are bolsters, and will be to the end of the chapter. I couldn't insult dear Lollo, but if you don't care--\"  \"Whilst I live--which will be longer than I desire or deserve--Lollo shall want nothing, but--you. I have too little tenderness for--my dear boy, you're faint. Can you spare me for a moment?\"  \"No, stay--Major!\"  \"What? What?\"  \"My head drifts so--if you wouldn't mind.\"  \"Yes! Yes!\"  \"Say a prayer by me. Out loud please, I am getting deaf.\"  \"My dearest Jackanapes--my dear boy--\"  \"One of the Church Prayers--Parade Service, you know--\"  \"I see. But the fact is--GOD forgive me, Jackanapes--I'm a very different sort of fellow to some of you youngsters. Look here, let me fetch--\"  But Jackanapes' hand was in his, and it wouldn't let go.  There was a brief and bitter silence.  \"'Pon my soul I can only remember the little one at the end.\"  \"Please,\" whispered Jackanapes.  Pressed by the conviction that what little he could do it was his duty to do, the Major--kneeling--bared his head, and spoke loudly, clearly, and very reverently--  \"The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ--\"  Jackanapes moved his left hand to his right one, which still held the Major's--  \"--The love of GOD.\"  And with that--Jackanapes died.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER VI.      \"Und so ist der blaue Himmel gr飉ser als jedes     Gew闤k darin, und dauerhafter dazu.\"  JEAN PAUL RICHTER.   Jackanapes' death was sad news for the Goose Green, a sorrow justly qualified by honorable pride in his gallantry and devotion. Only the Cobbler dissented, but that was his way. He said he saw nothing in it but foolhardiness and vain-glory. They might both have been killed, as easy as not, and then where would ye have been? A man's life was a man's life, and one life was as good as another. No one would catch him throwing his away. And, for that matter, Mrs. Johnson could spare a child a great deal better than Miss Jessamine.  But the parson preached Jackanapes' funeral sermon on the text, \"Whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it;\" and all the village went and wept to hear him.  Nor did Miss Jessamine see her loss from the Cobbler's point of view. On the contrary, Mrs. Johnson said she never to her dying day should forget how, when she went to condole with her, the old lady came forward, with gentle-womanly self-control, and kissed her, and thanked GOD that her dear nephew's effort had been blessed with success, and that this sad war had made no gap in her friend's large and happy home circle.  \"But she's a noble, unselfish woman,\" sobbed Mrs. Johnson, \"and she taught Jackanapes to be the same, and that's how it is that my Tony has been spared to me. And it must be sheer goodness in Miss Jessamine, for what can she know of a mother's feelings? And I'm sure most people seem to think that if you've a large family you don't know one from another any more than they do, and that a lot of children are like a lot of store-apples, if one's taken it won't be missed.\"  Lollo--the first Lollo, the Gipsy's Lollo--very aged, draws Miss Jessamine's bath-chair slowly up and down the Goose Green in the sunshine.  The Ex-postman walks beside him, which Lollo tolerates to the level of his shoulder. If the Postman advances any nearer to his head, Lollo quickens his pace, and were the Postman to persist in the injudicious attempt, there is, as Miss Jessamine says, no knowing what might happen.  In the opinion of the Goose Green, Miss Jessamine has borne her troubles \"wonderfully.\" Indeed, to-day, some of the less delicate and less intimate of those who see everything from the upper windows, say (well behind her back) that \"the old lady seems quite lively with her military beaux again.\"  The meaning of this is, that Captain Johnson is leaning over one side of her chair, whilst by the other bends a brother officer who is staying with him, and who has manifested an extraordinary interest in Lollo. He bends lower and lower, and Miss Jessamine calls to the Postman to request Lollo to be kind enough to stop, whilst she is fumbling for something which always hangs by her side, and has got entangled with her spectacles.  It is a two-penny trumpet, bought years ago in the village fair, and over it she and Captain Johnson tell, as best they can, between them, the story of Jackanapes' ride across the Goose Green; and how he won Lollo--the Gipsy's Lollo--the racer Lollo--dear Lollo--faithful Lollo--Lollo the never vanquished--Lollo the tender servant of his old mistress. And Lollo's ears twitch at every mention of his name.  Their hearer does not speak, but he never moves his eyes from the trumpet, and when the tale is told, he lifts Miss Jessamine's hand and presses his heavy black moustache in silence to her trembling fingers.  The sun, setting gently to his rest, embroiders the sombre foliage of the oak-tree with threads of gold. The Grey Goose is sensible of an atmosphere of repose, and puts up one leg for the night. The grass glows with a more vivid green, and, in answer to a ringing call from Tony, his sisters, fluttering over the daisies in pale-hued muslins, come out of their ever-open door, like pretty pigeons form a dovecote.  And, if the good gossips' eyes do not deceive them, all the Miss Johnsons, and both the officers, go wandering off into the lanes, where bryony wreaths still twine about the brambles.         *       *       *       *       *  A sorrowful story, and ending badly?  Nay, Jackanapes, for the end is not yet.  A life wasted that might have been useful?  Men who have died for men, in all ages, forgive the thought!  There is a heritage of heroic example and noble obligation, not reckoned in the Wealth of Nations, but essential to a nation's life; the contempt of which, in any people, may, not slowly, mean even its commercial fall.
