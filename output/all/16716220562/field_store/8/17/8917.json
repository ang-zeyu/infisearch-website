Aristotle was quite well aware that each of the big groups of animals was built upon one plan of structure, which showed endless variations \"in excess and defect\" in the different members of the group. But he did not realise that this fact of community of plan constituted a problem in itself. His interest was turned towards the functional side of living things, form was for him a secondary result of function.  Yet he was not unaware of facts of form for which he could not quite find a place in his theory of organic form, facts of form which were not, at first sight at least, facts of function. Thus he was aware of certain facts of \"correlation,\" which could not be explained off-hand as due to correlation of the functions of the parts. He knew, for instance, that all animals without front teeth in the upper jaw have cotyledons, while most that have front teeth on both jaws and no horns have no cotyledons (_De Gen._, ii. 7).  Speaking generally, however, we find in Aristotle no purely morphological concepts. What then does morphology owe to Aristotle? It owes to him, _first_, a great mass of facts about the structure of animals; _second_, the first scientific classification of animals;[6] _third_, a clear enunciation of the fact of community of plan within each of the big groups; _fourth_, an attempt to explain certain instances of the correlation of parts; _fifth_, a pregnant distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous parts; _sixth_, a generalisation on the succession of forms in development; and _seventh_, the first enunciation of the idea of the _Échelle des êtres_.  (1) What surprises the modern reader of the _Historia Animalium_ perhaps more than anything else is the extent and variety of Aristotle's knowledge of animals. He describes more than 500 kinds.[7] Not only does he know the ordinary beasts, birds, and fishes with which everyone is acquainted, but he knows a great deal about cuttlefish, snails and oysters, about crabs, crawfish (_Palinurus_), lobsters, shrimps, and hermit crabs, about sea-urchins and starfish, sea-anemones and sponges, about ascidians (which seem to have puzzled him not a little!). He has noticed even fish-lice and intestinal worms, both flat and round. Of the smaller land animals, he knows a great many insects and their larvæ. The extent of his anatomical knowledge is equally surprising, and much of it is clearly the result of personal observation. No one can read his account of the internal anatomy of the chameleon (_Hist. Anim._, ii.), or his description of the structure of cuttlefish (_Hist. Anim._, iv), or that touch in the description of the hermit crab (_Hist. Anim._, iv.)--\" Two large eyes ... not ... turned on one side like those of crabs, but straight forward\"--without being convinced that Aristotle is speaking of what he has seen. Naturally he could not make much of the anatomy of small insects and snails, and, to tell the truth, he does not seem to have cared greatly about the minutiæ of structure. He was too much of a Greek and an aristocrat to care about laborious detail.  Not only did he lay a foundation for comparative anatomy, but he made a real start with comparative embryology. Medical men before him had known many facts about human development; Aristotle seems to have been the first to study in any detail the development of the chick. He describes this as it appears to the naked eye, the position of the embryo on the yolk, the palpitating spot at the third day, the formation of the body and of the large sightless eyes, the veins on the yolk, the embryonic membranes, of which he distinguished two.  (2) Aristotle had various systems of classifying animals. They could be classified, he thought, according to their structure, their manner of reproduction, their manner of life, their mode of locomotion, their food, and so on. Thus you might, in addition to structural classifications, divide animals into gregarious, solitary and social, or land animals into troglodytes, surface-dwellers, and burrowers (_Hist. Anim._, i.).  He knew that dichotomous classifications were of little use for animals (_De Partibus_, i. 3) and he explicitly and in so many words accepted the principle of all \"natural\" classification, that affinities must be judged by comparing not one but the sum total of characters. As everyone knows, he was the first to distinguish the big groups of animals, many of which were already distinguished roughly by the common usages of speech. Among his Sanguinea he did little more than define with greater exactitude the limits of the groups established by the popular classification. Among the \"exsanguineous\" animals, however, corresponding to our Invertebrates, he established a much more definite classification than the popular, which is apt to call them indiscriminately \"shellfish,\" \"insects,\" or \"creeping things.\" He went beyond the superficialities of popular classification, too, in clearly separating Cetacea from fishes. He had some notion of species and genera in our sense. He distinguished many species of cuttlefish--_Octopus (Polypus)_ of which there were many kinds, _Eledone (Moschites)_ which he knew to have only one row of suckers while _Octopus_ has two, _Argonauta, Nautilus, Sepia_, and apparently _Loligo media_ (= his Teuthis) and _L. vulgaris_(or _forbesii_) which seems to be his Teuthos. He had a grasp of the principles which should be followed in judging of the natural affinities of species. For example, he knew that the cuckoo resembles a hawk. \"But,\" he says, \"the hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo has not, nor does it resemble the hawk in the form of its head, but in these respects is more like the pigeon than the hawk, which it resembles in nothing but its colour; the markings, however, upon the hawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is spotted\" (_Hist. Anim._, Cresswell's trans., p. 147, London, 1862).  The groups he distinguished were--man, viviparous quadrupeds, oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, Cetacea, Cephalopoda, Malacostraca (= higher Crustacea), Insecta (= annulose animals), Testacea (= molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians). A class of Acalephæ, including sea-anemones and sponges, was grouped with the Testacea. The first five groups were classed together as sanguineous, the others as exsanguineous, from the presence or absence of red blood.  Besides these classes \"there are,\" he says, \"many other creatures in the sea which it is not possible to arrange in any class from their scarcity\" (Creswell, _loc. cit._, p. 90).  (3) Aristotle's greatest service to morphology is his clear recognition of the unity of plan holding throughout each of the great groups.  He recognises this most clearly in the case of man and the viviparous quadrupeds, with whose structure he was best acquainted. In the _Historia Animalium_ he takes man as a standard, and describes his external and internal parts in detail, then considers viviparous quadrupeds and compares them with man. \"Whatever parts a man has before, a quadruped has beneath; those that are behind in man form the quadruped's back\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 26). Apes, monkeys, and Cynocephali combine the characteristics of man and quadrupeds. He notices that all viviparous quadrupeds have hair. Oviparous quadrupeds resemble the viviparous, but they lack some organs, such as ears with an external pinna, mammæ, hair. Oviparous bipeds, or birds, also \"have many parts like the animals described above.\" He does not, however, seem to realise that a bird's wings are the equivalent of a mammal's arms or fore-legs. Fishes are much more divergent; they possess no neck, nor limbs, nor testicles (meaning a solid ovoid body such as the testis in mammals), nor mammæ. Instead of hair they have scales.  Speaking generally, the Sanguinea differ from man and from one another in their parts, which may be present or absent, or exhibit differences in \"excess and defect,\" or in form. Unity of plan extends to all the principal systems of organs. \"All sanguineous animals have either a bony or a spinous column. The remainder of the bones exist in some animals; but not in others, for if they have the limbs they have the bones belonging to them\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 60). \"Viviparous animals with blood and feet do not differ much in their bones, but rather by analogy, in hardness, softness, and size\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 59). The venous system, too, is built upon the same general plan throughout the Sanguinea. \"In all sanguineous animals, the nature and origin of the principal veins are the same, but the multitude of smaller veins is not alike in all, for neither are the parts of the same nature, nor do all possess the same parts\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 56). It will be noticed in the first and last of these three quotations that Aristotle recognises the fact of correlation between systems of organs,--between limbs and bones, and between blood-vessels and the parts to which they go.  Sanguineous animals all possess certain organs--heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and so on. Other organs occur in most of the classes--the oesophagus and the lungs. \"The position which these parts occupy is the same in all animals [sc. Sanguinea]\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 39).  Unity of plan is observable not only in the Sanguinea, but also within each of the other large groups. Aristotle recognises that all his cuttlefish are alike in structure. Among his Malacostraca he compares point by point the external parts of the carabus (_Palinurus_), and the astacus (_Homarus_), and he compares also the general internal anatomy of the various \"genera\" he distinguishes. As regards Testacea, he writes, \"The nature of their internal structure is similar in all, especially in the turbinated animals, for they differ in size and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],["title","Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#2)"],["body"," the relations of excess; the univalves and bivalves do not exhibit many differences\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 83). There is an interesting remark about \"the creature called carcinium\" (hermit-crab), that it \"resembles both the Malacostraca and the Testacea, for this in its nature is similar to the animals that are like carabi, and it is born naked\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 85). In the last phrase we may perhaps read the first recognition of the embryological criterion.  With the recognition of unity of plan within each group necessarily goes the recognition of what later morphology calls the homology of parts. The parts of a horse can be compared one by one with the parts of another viviparous quadruped; in all the animals belonging to the same class the parts are the same, only they differ in excess or defect--these remarks are placed in the forefront of the _Historia Animalium_. Generally speaking, parts which bear the same name are for Aristotle homologous throughout the class. But he goes further and notes the essential resemblance underlying the differences of certain parts. He classes together nails and claws, the spines of the hedgehog, and hair, as being homologous structures. He says that teeth are allied to bones, whereas horns are more nearly allied to skin (_Hist. Anim._, iii.). This is an astonishingly happy guess, considering that all he had to go upon was the observation that in black animals the horns are black but the teeth white. One cannot but admire the way in which Aristotle fixes upon apparently trivial and commonplace facts, and draws from them far-reaching consequences. He often goes wrong, it is true, but he always errs in the grand manner.  While Aristotle certainly recognised the existence of homologies, and even had a feeling for them, he did not clearly distinguish homology from analogy. He comes pretty near the distinction in the following passage. After explaining that in animals belonging to the same class the parts are the same, differing only in excess or defect, he says, \"But some animals agree with each other in their parts neither in form nor in excess and defect, but have only an analogous likeness, such as a bone bears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, a hand to a crab's claw, the scale of a fish to the feather of a bird, for that which is a feather in the bird is a scale in the fish\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 2). One of these comparisons is, however, a homology not an analogy, and the last phrase throws a little doubt upon the whole question, for it is not made clear whether it is position or function that determines what are equivalent organs.  In the _De Partibus Animalium_ there occurs the following passage:--\"Groups that only differ in degree, and in the more or less of an identical element that they possess, are aggregated under a single class; groups whose attributes are not identical but analogous are separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by gradation, or by excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, others short ones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote and only agree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, in the fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve universally as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all animals present analogies in their corresponding parts.\"[8] It is thus similarity in form and structure which determines the formation of the main groups. Within each group the parts differ only in degree, in largeness or smallness, softness and hardness, smoothness or roughness, and the like (_loc. cit._, i., 4, 644^b). These passages show that Aristotle had some conception of homology as distinct from analogy. He did not, however, develop the idea. What Aristotle sought in the variety of animal structure, and what he found, were not homologies, but rather communities of function, parts with the same attributes. His interest was all in _organs_, in functioning parts, not in the mere spatial relationship of parts.  This comes out clearly in his treatise _On the Parts of Animals_, which is subsequent to, and the complement of, his _History of Animals_. The latter is a description of the variety of animal form, the former is a treatise on the functions of the parts. He describes the plan of the _De Partibus Animalium_ as follows:--\"We have, then, first to describe the common functions, common, that is, to the whole animal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or to members of a species. In other words, we have to describe the attributes common to all animals, or to assemblages, like the class of Birds, of closely allied groups differentiated by gradation, or to groups like Man not differentiated into subordinate groups. In the first case the common attributes may be called analogous, in the second generic, in the third specific\" (i, 5, 645^b, trans. Ogle). The alimentary canal is a good example of a part which is \"analogous\" throughout the animal kingdom, for \"all animals possess in common those parts by which they take in food, and into which they receive it\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 6).  The _De Partibus Animalium_ becomes in form a comparative organography, but the emphasis is always on function and community of function. Thus he treats of bone, \"fish-spine,\" and cartilage together (_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a), because they have the same function, though he says elsewhere that they are only analogous structures (ii., 8, 653^b). In the same connection he describes also the supporting tissues of Invertebrates--the hard exoskeleton of Crustacea and Insects, the shell of Testacea, the \"bone\" of _Sepia_ (ii., 8, 654^a). Aristotle took much more interest in analogies, in organs of similar function, than in homologies. He did recognise the existence of homologies, but rather _malgré lui_, because the facts forced it upon him.  His only excursion into the realm of \"transcendental anatomy\" is his comparison of a Cephalopod to a doubled-up Vertebrate whose legs have become adherent to its head, whose alimentary canal has doubled upon itself in such a way as to bring the anus near the mouth (_De Partibus_, iv., 9, 684^b). It is clear, however, that Aristotle did not seek to establish by this comparison any true homologies of parts, but merely analogies, thus avoiding the error into which Meyranx and Laurencet fell more than two thousand years later in their paper communicated to the Académie des Sciences, which formed the starting-point of the famous controversy between Cuvier and E. Geoffroy St Hilaire (see Chap. V., below).  Moreover, Aristotle did not so much compare a Cephalopod with a doubled-up Vertebrate as contrast Cephalopods (and also Testacea) with all other animals. Other animals have their organs in a straight line; Cephalopods and Testacea alone show this peculiar doubling up of the body.  (4) Aristotle was much struck with certain facts of correlation, of the interdependence of two organs which are not apparently in functional dependence on one another. Such correlation may be positive or negative; the presence of one organ may either entail the presence of the other, or it may entail its absence. Aristotle has various ways of explaining facts of correlation. He observed that no animal has both tusks and horns, but this fact could easily be explained on the principle that Nature never makes anything superfluous or in vain. If an animal is protected by the possession of tusks it does not require horns, and _vice versa_. The correlation of a multiple stomach with deficient development of the teeth (as in Ruminants) is accounted for by saying that the animal needs its complex stomach to make up for the shortcomings of its teeth! (_De Partibus_, iii., 14, 674^b.) Other examples of correlation were not susceptible of this explanation in terms of final causes. He lays stress on the fact, in the main true, of the inverse development of horns and front teeth in the upper jaw, exemplified in Ruminants. He explains the fact in this way. Teeth and horns are formed from earthy matter in the body and there is not enough to form both teeth and horns, so \"Nature by subtracting from the teeth adds to the horns; the nutriment which in most animals goes to the former being here spent on the augmentation of the latter\" (_De Partibus_, iii., 2, 664^a, trans. Ogle). A similar kind of explanation is offered of the fact that Selachia have cartilage instead of bone, \"in these Selachia Nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin [_i.e._, on the placoid scales]; and she is unable to allot to many different parts one and the same superfluity of material\" (_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a, trans. Ogle). Speaking generally, \"Nature invariably gives to one part what she subtracts from another\" (_loc. cit._, ii., 14, 658^a).  This thought reappears again in the 19th century in E. Geoffroy St Hilaire's _loi de balancement_ and also in Goethe's writings on morphology. For Aristotle it meant that Nature was limited by the nature of her means, that finality was limited by necessity. Thus in the larger animals there is an excess of earthy matter, as a necessary result of the material nature of the animal; this excess is turned by Nature to good account, but there is not enough to serve both for teeth and for horns (_loc. cit._, iii., 2, 663^b).  But there are other instances of correlation which seem to have taxed even Aristotle's ingenuity beyond its powers. Thus he knew that all animals (meaning viviparous quadrupeds) with no front teeth in the upper jaw have cotyledons on their foetal membranes, and that most animals which have front teeth in both jaws and no horns have no cotyledons (_De Generatione_, ii., 7). He offers no explanation of this, but accepts it as a fact.  We may conveniently refer here to one or two other ideas of Aristotle regarding the causes of form. He makes the profound remark that the possible range of form of an organ is limited to some extent by its existing"]]]
