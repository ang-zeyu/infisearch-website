Buoyed up by the success of our armies, every one expected an early peace, and even the busiest of us began making projects for the fair future.  In the odd moments of relief from my somewhat onerous hospital duties, my only pleasure and distraction was to build castles in the air, and in the eternal Winter lights I laid many a plan for a little boudoir next my bedroom, which I had long desired to see realised.  When news of H.'s safety reached me, my imagination knew no limits.  The convalescent patients from all branches of trade, who at different times had filled the rooms of the château, converted into wards, had been very deft at repairing everything in the way of furniture that the Germans had defaced or neglected to appropriate.  There were many skilful carpenters and cabinet makers among them, and I saw visions of employing them at their own trade, producing both occupation, which they craved, and funds which they needed, but were too proud to accept as gifts, and what a surprise that room would be for H.!  I even pushed my collector's mania so far as to pay a visit to an old bourgeois who lived in a little city called La Ferté-Milon, quite a bit north of us.  The walls of his salon were ornamented with some charming eighteenth century paper representing the ports of France, and in excellent condition.  I had long coveted it for my boudoir, and in days before the war had often dickered with him as to price.  I now feared lest it should have been destroyed or disfigured, and regretted having wished to drive too keen a bargain, but on finding it intact, I am ashamed to say the collector's instinct got the better of the woman, and I used every conceivable argument to persuade him to come to my price.  The old fellow was as obdurate as ever.  \"But,\" I suggested, \"don't you realise what a risk you are taking? Suppose the Germans were to get back here again before you sell it? You're much nearer the front than we!  You will not only lose your money, but the world will be minus one more good thing, and we've lost too many of those already.\"  The withering glance with which this remark was received was as good as any discourse on patriotism.  \"The Germans back here?  Never!  Why at the rate we're going now it will be all over before Spring and you'll see what a price my paper will fetch just as soon as peace comes!\"  Peace!  Peace! the word was on every lip, the thought in every heart, and yet every intelligence, every energy was bent on the prosecution of the most hateful warfare ever known.  In all the universe it seemed to me that the wild animals were the only creatures really exempt from preoccupation about the fray.  It might be war for man and the friends of man, but for them had come an unexpected reprieve, and even the more wary soon felt their exemption from pursuit.  Man was so busy fighting his own kind that a wonderful armistice had unconsciously arisen between him and these creatures, and so birds and beasts, no longer frightened by his proximity, were indulging in a perfect revel of freedom.  During the first weeks of the conflict, the \"cotton-tails,\" always so numerous on our estate, were simply terrified by the booming of the guns.  If even the distant bombardment assumed any importance, they would disappear below ground completely, for days at a time.  My old foxhound was quite disconcerted.  But like all the rest of us they soon became accustomed to it, and presently displayed a self assurance and a familiarity undreamed of, save perhaps in the Garden of Eden.  [Illustration: VIEW OF CHATEAU-THIERRY]  It became a common sight to see a brood of partridges or pheasants strutting along the roadside like any barnyard hen and chickens, and one recalled with amazement the times when stretching themselves on their claws they would timidly and fearfully crane their necks above the grass at the sound of an approaching step.  At present they are not at all sure that man was their worst enemy. The Government having decreed that there shall be no game shooting in the army zone, weazels, pole cats and even fox have become very numerous, and covey of quail that once numbered ten and fifteen, have singularly diminished by this incursion of wild animals, not to mention the hawks, the buzzards and the squirrels.  One Autumn morning I appeared at our gateway just in time to see a neighbour's wife homeward bound, the corpses of four white hens that _Maître Renard_ had borrowed from their coop, dangling from her arm. Her husband heard her coming, and on learning the motive of her wails, the imprecations brought down on the head of that fox were picturesquely profane to say the least.  Presently the scene grew in violence, and then finally terminated with the assertion that the whole tragedy was the result of the Kaiser's having thrown open the German prisons and turned loose his vampires on France.  Be that as it may, there was certainly no more enchanting way of obtaining mental and physical relaxation than in wandering through those wonderful woodlands that abound in our vicinity, and which breathed so many inspirations to the Master of Fable, who at one time was their keeper.  How I wish that good La Fontaine might have seen his dumb friends under present circumstances.  What fantasies would he not have woven about them.  Season and the temperature were of little importance.  There was never a promenade without an incident--never an incident, no matter how insignificant, that did not remind me of the peculiar phase under which every living creature was existing.  Once in the very early Spring, taking my faithful Boston bull, we stole away for a constitutional.  Suddenly my little companion darted up close to the hedgerow, and on hurrying to the scene to find out the cause of this departure from her usual dignified demeanour, I found her standing face to face with a hare!  Both animals, while startled, were rooted to the spot, gazing at each other in sheer fascination of their own fearlessness.  It was so amazingly odd that I laughed aloud.  But even this did not break the spell.  It lasted so long that presently even I became a little puzzled.  Finally it was the hare who settled the question by calmly moving away, without the slightest sign of haste, leaving my bull dog in the most comical state of concern that I have ever seen.  It was about this time that _Fil-de-Ver_, our donkey, decided to abandon civilised life in favour of a more roaming career in the woods, which he doubtless felt was his only true vocation.  He had fared ill at the hands of the Germans, and during the entire Winter our own boys had used him regularly to haul dead wood.  This kind of _kultur_ he resented distinctly, and resolved to show his disgust by becoming more independent.  First he tried it out for a day or two at a time.  Then he was gone a week, and finally he disappeared altogether.  Being of sociable disposition he joined a little herd of deer which was the pride and joy of our woods, and one afternoon I came upon this motley company down by a little lick we had arranged on the brink of a tiny river that crosses our estate.  As I approached they all lifted their heads.  A baby fawn, frightened, scurried into the underbrush.  But the others let me come quite close, and then gently, as though to display their nimbleness and grace, bounded away mid the tender green foliage, gold splashed here and there by the fast sinking sun.  _Fil-de-Fer_ stood a moment undecided. Presently, lifting his hind legs high into the air he gave vent to a series of kickings and contortions which might have been taken for a comical imitation, while a second later as though realising how ridiculous he had been, he fell to braying with despair, and breaking into a gallop fled in the direction of his new found friends.  Simultaneous with _Fil-de-Fer's_ disappearance came the rumour that the _Loup-garou_ was abroad and was sowing panic in its wake.  Just what kind of animal the _Loup-garou_ might be, was somewhat difficult to ascertain.  No one in our vicinity had ever seen him, and from all I could gather he seemed to be a strange sort of apocalyptic beast, gifted with horns, extraordinary force, and the especial enemy of mankind.  There was something almost uncanny in the way the peasants would look at one and lower their voices when speaking of this weird phenomenon, and presently from having suspected my innocent donkey, I began to wonder if I were not in the presence of some local popular superstition.  The rumour was still persistent, when one evening at dark there was an urgent call from Headquarters asking that we send down for four or five patients that were destined for our hospital.  I do not now recall for just what reason I went alone, save for a twelve-year-old village lad, but what I do remember was the respectful moral lecture that I received from an old peasant woman who met our cart on the high-road just before we turned off into the Bois du Loup.  Night, black and starless, was upon us before we had penetrated half a mile into the woods.  My youthful companion began to sing martial airs, and stimulated his courage by beating time with his feet on the bottom of the cart.  A chill Autumn rain commenced to fall, tinkling against the rare leaves that now remained on the trees, blinding both horse and driver, and greatly impeding our progress.  Presently I noticed that our lantern had gone out, and fearing lest we be borne down upon by some swift moving army truck, I produced a pocket lamp and descended from my seat.  A handful of damp matches, much time and good humour were consumed ere I succeeded in getting a light, and just as I swung the lantern back into place, the air was pierced by a high-pitched, blood-curdling shriek!  _Le Loup_ . . . !  At the same moment there was a sharp crackling on the opposite side of the road, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20111"],["title","With Those Who Wait (#2)"],["body","instant later a wild boar, followed by her young, brushed past me and darted into the obscurity.  My companion was livid.  His teeth chattered audibly.  He tried to pull himself together and murmured incoherent syllables.  Personally, I was a bit unnerved, yet somewhat reassured.  If my eyes had not deceived me, the mystery of the _Loup-garou_ was now solved.  And yet I felt quite sure that wild boar were unknown in our region.  At Château-Thierry I made enquiries and from soldiers and foresters learned that heretofore inhabitants of the Ardennes forest, these animals had been driven South when man had chosen to make the firing line of their haunts; and that, prolific breeders, they were now practically a menace to the unarmed civilian.  From these same lovers of nature I gathered that for the first time in their recollection sea-gulls and curlews had likewise been seen on the banks of the Marne.  While the country now abounds in newcomers, many of the old familiar birds and animals are rapidly disappearing.  Larks are rare visitors these days, and the thrush which used to hover over our vineyards in real flocks, have almost entirely vanished.  The swallows, however, are our faithful friends and have never failed to return to us.  Each succeeding Spring their old haunts are in a more or less dilapidated condition according to the number of successful visits the German aviators have chosen to pay us during the Winter, and I fancy that this upsets them a trifle.  For hundreds of generations they have been accustomed to nest in the pinions of certain roofs, to locate in a determined chimney, and it is a most amusing sight to see them cluster about a ruined spot and discuss the matter in strident chirpings.  Last season, after a family consultation, which lasted well nigh all the morning, and during which they made repeated visits of inspection to a certain favourite drain pipe, I suddenly saw them all lift wing and sail away towards the North.  My heart sank.  Something near and dear seemed to be slipping from me, and one has said _au revoir_ so oft in vain.  So they too were going to abandon me!  In one accustomed to daily coping with big human problems, such emotion may seem trivial, but it was perhaps this constant forced endurance that kept one up, made one almost supersensitively sentimental.  Little things grew to count tremendously.  At lunch time I sauntered forth quite sad at heart, when an unexpected familiar twittering greeted my ear, and I turned northward to see my little friends circling about the stables.  Life closer to the front had evidently not offered any particular advantages, and in a few days' time their constant comings and goings from certain specific points told me that they had come back to stay.  But if friend swallow may be praised for his fidelity, unfortunately not so much can be said for another familiar passerby--the wild duck. October had always seen them flocking southward, and some one of our household had invariably heard their familiar call, as at daybreak they would pass over the château on their way from the swamps of the Somme to the Marais de St. Gond.  The moment was almost a solemn one.  It seemed to mark an epoch in the tide of our year.  Claude, Benôit, George and a decrepit gardener would abandon all work and prepare boats, guns and covers on the Marne.  Oh, the wonderful still hours just before dawn!  Ah, that indescribable, intense, yet harmonious silence that preceded the arrival of our prey!  Alas, all is but memory now.  Claude has fallen before Verdun, Benôit was killed on the Oise, and George has long since been reported missing.  Alone, unarmed, the old gardener and I again awaited the cry of our feathered friends, but our waiting, like that of so many others, was in vain.  The wild ducks are a thing of the past.  Where have they gone? No one knows, no one has ever seen them.  And in the tense hush of the Autumn nights, above the distant rumble of the cannon rose only the plaintive cry of stray dogs baying at the moon.  Dogs, _mon Dieu_, I wonder how many of those poor, forgotten, abandoned creatures having strayed into our barnyard were successively washed, combed, fed, cared for and adopted.  Some of them, haunted by the spirit of unrest, remained with us but a moment; others tried us for a day, a week, and still others, appreciative of our pains, refused to leave at all.  Oh, the heart rending, lonesome, appealing look in the eyes of a poor brute that has lost home and master!  It is thus that I came into possession of an ill tempered French poodle called _Crapouillot_, which the patients in our hospital insisted on clipping like a lion with an anklet, a curl over his nose and a puff at the end of his tail.  A most detestable, unfortunate beast, always to be found where not needed, a ribbon in his hair, and despicably bad humoured.  He was succeeded by a Belgian sheep dog, baptised _Namur_, who in time gave place to one of the most hopelessly ugly mongrels I have ever seen.  But the new comer was so full of life and good will, had such a comical way of smiling and showing his gleaming white teeth, that in memory of the joy caused by the Charlie Chaplin films, he was unanimously dubbed _Charlot_.  The mere sound of his name would plunge him into ecstasies of joy, accompanied by the wildest yapping and strange capers, which invariably terminated by a double somersault in the mud so anxious was he to convince us of his gratitude.  Imagine then what might be obtained by a caress, or a bowl of hot soup.  Last in line, but by no means least, was a splendid English pointer, a superb, finely bred animal, who day in, day out would lie by the open fire, lost in a profound revery that terminated in a kind of sob. Poor, melancholy _Mireille_, what master was she mourning?  For what home did she thus pine?  How I respected and appreciated her sadness. How intensely human she became.  Finally when I could resist no longer I would take her long delicate head into my hands and gently stroke it, seeking to impart my sympathy. \"I know that you never can be mine,\" I would murmur, \"that you will ever and eternally belong to him to whom you gave yourself once and entirely.  But these are sad anxious days for us all; we must bear together.  And so as my own dogs have often been my only consolation in like times of misery and despair, oh, how I would love to comfort you--beautiful, faithful, disconsolate Mireille!\"     II  Cities, like people, seem to have souls, deep hidden and rarely ever entirely revealed.  How well must one come to know them, stone by stone, highways, homes and habitants, ere they will disclose their secret.  I have rejoiced too often in the splendid serenity of St. Jean des Vignes, felt too deeply the charm of those ancient streets, hoped and suffered too intensely within its confines that Soissons should not mean more to me than to the average zealous newspaper correspondent, come there but to make note of its wounds, to describe its ruins.  Fair Soissons, what is now your fate?  In what state shall we find you? What ultimate destiny is reserved for your cathedral, your stately mansions, your magnificent gardens?  What has become of those fifteen or sixteen hundred brave souls who loved you so well that they refused to leave you?  _Qui sait_?  One arrived at Soissons in war time by long avenues, shaded on either side by a double row of stately elms, whose centenary branches stretching upward formed an archway overhead.  Then came the last outpost of Army Police, a sentinel stopped you, minutely examined your passports, verified their visés, and finally, all formalities terminated, one entered what might have been the City of Death.  Moss and weeds had sprung up between the cobble stone pavings; as far as eye could see not a human soul was astir, not a familiar noise was to be heard, not a breath of smoke stole heavenwards from those hundreds of idle chimneys: and yet life, tenacious ardent life was wonderfully evident here and there.  A curtain lifted as one passed, a cat on the wall, a low distant whistle, clothes drying at a window, a flowering plant on a balcony, sometimes a door ajar, through which one guessed a store in whose dimly lighted depths shadows seemed to be moving about; all these bore witness to an eager, undaunted existence, hidden for the time being perhaps, but intense and victorious, ready to spring forward and struggle anew in admirable battles of energy and conscience.  The Hotel du Soleil d'Or offered a most hospitable welcome.  It was the only one open or rather, if one would be exact, the only one still extant.  To be sure there were no panes in the windows, and ungainly holes were visible in almost all the ceilings, but the curtains were spotlessly white and the bed linen smelled sweet from having been dried in the open air.  A most appreciable surprise was the excellent _cuisine_, and as ornament to the dining-room table, between a pair of tall preserve dishes, and on either side of the central bouquet, stood an unexploded German shell.  One of them had fallen on to the proprietor's bed, the second landing in the pantry, while twenty or thirty others had worked more efficiently, as could be attested by the ruins of the carriage house, stables, and what had once been a glass covered Winter garden.  On a door leading out of the office, and curiously enough left intact, one might read, _Salon de conversation_.  If you were to attempt to cross the threshold, however, your eye would be instantly greeted by a most abominable heap of plaster and wreckage, and the jovial proprietor seeing your embarrassment, would explain:  \"My wife and the servants are all for cleaning up, but to my mind it's better to leave things just as they are.  Besides if we put all to rights now, when our patrons return they will never credit half we tell them.  Seeing is believing!  At any rate, it's an out of the way place, and isn't bothering people for"]]]
