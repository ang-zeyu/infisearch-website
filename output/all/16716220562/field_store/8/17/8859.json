[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#5)"],["body","the quay, thinking to _quiz_ a poor Irishman, asked him, \"How do the potatoes eat now, Pat?\" The Irish lad, who happened to have a _shillalah_ in his hand, answered, \"O! they eat very well, my jewel, would you like to taste the _stalk_?\" and knocking the inquirer down, coolly walked off.           CXXIII.--DOG-MATIC.  IN the great dispute between South and Sherlock, the latter, who was a great courtier, said, \"His adversary reasoned well, but he barked like a cur.\" To which the other replied, \"That _fawning_ was the property of a cur as well as barking.\"           CXXIV.--FALSE QUANTITY.  A LEARNED counsel in the Exchequer spoke of a _nolle prosequi_. \"Consider, sir,\" said Baron Alderson, \"that this is the last day of term, and don't make things _unnecessarily long_.\"           CXXV.--IN SUSPENSE.  THE sloth, in its wild state, spends its life in trees, and never leaves them but from force or accident. The eagle to the sky, the mole to the ground, the sloth to the tree; but what is most extraordinary, he lives not _upon_ the branches, but _under_ them. He moves suspended, rests suspended, sleeps suspended, and passes his life in suspense,--like a young clergyman _distantly related_ to a bishop.           CXXVI.--PORSON'S VISIT TO THE CONTINENT.  SOON after Professor Porson returned from a visit to the Continent, at a party where he happened to be present, a gentleman solicited a sketch of his journey. Porson immediately gave the following extemporaneous one:      \"I went to Frankfort and got drunk     With that most learned professor, Brunck;     I went to Worts and got more drunken     With that more learned professor, Ruhnken.\"           CXXVII.--ARTIFICIAL HEAT.  THE late Lord Kelly had a very red face. \"Pray, my lord,\" said Foote to him, \"come and _look over_ my garden-wall,--my cucumbers are very backward.\"           CXXVIII.--OUTWARD APPEARANCE.  MAN is a sort of tree which we are too apt to judge of by the bark.           CXXIX.--THE TWO SMITHS.  A GENTLEMAN, with the same Christian and surname, took lodgings in the same house with James Smith. The consequence was, eternal confusion of calls and letters. Indeed, the postman had no alternative but to share the letters equally between the two. \"This is intolerable, sir,\" said our friend, \"and you must quit.\"--\"Why am I to quit more than you?\"--\"Because you are James the Second--and must _abdicate_.\"           CXXX.--SAGE ADVICE.  THE advice given by an Irishman to his English friend, on introducing him to a regular Tipperary row, was, \"Wherever you see a head, _hit it_.\"           CXXXI.--THE PURSER.  LADY HARDWICKE, the lady of the Chancellor, loved money as well as he did, and what _he_ got _she_ saved. The purse in which the Great Seal is carried is of very expensive embroidery, and was provided, during his time, every year. Lady Hardwicke took care that it should not be provided for the seal-bearer's profit, for she annually retained them herself, having previously ordered that the velvet should be of the length of one of the state rooms at Wimpole. So many of them were saved, that at length she had enough to hang the state-room, and make curtains for the bed. Lord Hardwicke used to say, \"There was not such a _purser_ in the navy.\"           CXXXII.--A FOREIGN ACCENT.  WHEN Maurice Margarot was tried at Edinburgh for sedition, the Lord Justice asked him, \"Hae you ony counsel, mon?\"--\"No.\"--\"Do you want to hae ony appointed?\"--\"I only want an interpreter to make me _understand_ what your lordships say.\"           CXXXIII--EASY AS LYING.  ERSKINE, examining a bumptious fellow, asked him, if he were not a rider? \"I'm a traveller, sir,\" replied the witness, with an air of offended importance. \"Indeed, sir. And, pray, are you addicted to the _failing_ usually attributed to travellers?\"           CXXXIV.--NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.  A PRISONER in The Fleet sent to his creditor to let him know that he had a proposal to make, which he believed would be for their mutual benefit. Accordingly, the creditor calling on him to hear it: \"I have been thinking,\" said he, \"that it is a very idle thing for me to lie here, and put you to the expense of seven groats a week. My being so chargeable to you has given me great uneasiness, and who knows what it may cost you in the end! Therefore, what I propose is this: You shall let me out of prison, and, instead of _seven_ groats, you shall allow me only _eighteenpence_ a week, and the other _tenpence_ shall go towards the discharging of the debt.\"           CXXXV.--EPIGRAM.  (On the column to the Duke of York's memory.)      IN former times the illustrious dead were burned,     Their hearts preserved in sepulchre inurned;     This column, then, commemorates the part     Which custom makes us single out--the heart;     You ask, \"How by a column this is done?\"     I answer, \"_'Tis a hollow thing of stone_.\"           CXXXVI.--FLATTERY TURNED TO ADVANTAGE.  A DEPENDANT was praising his patron for many virtues which he did not possess. \"I will do all in my power to prevent you _lying_,\" answered he.           CXXXVII.--THE INTRUDER REBUKED.  JERROLD and some friends were dining in a private room at a tavern. After dinner the landlord informed the company that the house was partly under repair, and requested that a stranger might be allowed to take a chop at a separate table in the apartment. The company assented, and the stranger, a person of commonplace appearance, was introduced, ate his chop in silence, and then fell asleep, snoring so loudly and inharmoniously that conversation was disturbed. Some gentlemen of the party made a noise, and the stranger, starting from his sleep, shouted to Jerrold, \"I know you, Mr. Jerrold; but you shall not make a butt of me!\"--\"Then don't bring your _hog's head_ in here,\" was the prompt reply.           CXXXVIII.--CRITICAL POLITENESS.  A YOUNG author reading a tragedy, perceived his auditor very often pull off his hat at the end of a line, and asked him the reason. \"I cannot pass a very _old_ acquaintance,\" replied the critic, \"without that civility.\"           CXXXIX.--A GOOD PLACE.  A NOBLEMAN taking leave when going as ambassador, the king said to him, \"The principal instruction you require is, to observe a line of conduct exactly the reverse to that of your predecessor.\"--\"Sire,\" replied he, \"I will endeavor so to act that you shall not have occasion to give _my_ successor the like advice.\"           CXL.--A CABAL.  THE attempt to run over the King of the French with a cab, looked like a conspiracy to overturn _monarchy_ by a _common-wheel_.           CXLI.--THE FIRE OF LONDON.  ONE speaking of the fire of London, said, \"Cannon Street roared, Bread Street was burnt to a crust, Crooked Lane was burnt straight, Addle Hill staggered, Creed Lane would not believe it till it came, Distaff Lane had sprung a fine thread, Ironmonger Lane was redhot, Seacoal Lane was burnt to a cinder, Soper Lane was in the suds, the Poultry was too much singed, Thames Street was dried up, Wood Street was burnt to ashes, Shoe Lane was burnt to boot, Snow Hill was melted down, Pudding Lane and Pye Corner were over baked.\"           CXLII.--A DOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT.      THE speeches made by P---- are _sound_,       It cannot be denied;     Granted; and then it will be found,       They're _little else_ beside.           CXLIII.--AN HONEST HORSE.  A DEALER once, selling a nag to a gentleman, frequently observed, with emphatic earnestness, that \"he was an _honest_ horse.\" After the purchase the gentleman asked him what he meant by an honest horse. \"Why, sir,\" replied the seller, \"whenever I rode him he always threatened to _throw_ me, and he certainly never _deceived_ me.\"           CXLIV.--THE RETORT CUTTING.  BISHOPS SHERLOCK and HOADLY were both freshmen of the same year, at Catherine Hall, Cambridge. The classical subject in which they were first lectured was Tully's Offices, and one morning Hoadly received a compliment from the tutor for the excellence of his construing. Sherlock, a little vexed at the preference shown to his rival, said, when they left the lecture-room, \"Ben, you made good use of L'Estrange's _translation_ to-day.\"--\"Why, no, Tom,\" retorted Hoadly, \"I did not, for I had not got one; and I forgot to borrow yours, which, I am told, is the only one in the college.\"           CXLV.--ELEGANT COMPLIMENT.  MR. HENRY ERSKINE, being one day in London, in company with the Duchess of Gordon, said to her, \"Are we never again to enjoy the honor and pleasure of your grace's society at Edinburgh?\"--\"O!\" answered her grace, \"Edinburgh is a vile dull place--I hate it.\"--\"Madam,\" replied the gallant barrister, \"the sun might as well say, there's a vile dark morning,--I _won't rise_ to-day.\"           CXLVI.--A LOVE SONG, BY DEAN SWIFT.      A PUD IN is almi de si re,     Mimis tres Ine ver require,     Alo veri find it a gestis,     His miseri ne ver at restis.           CXLVII.--BY THE SAME.      MOLLIS abuti,     Has an acuti,     No lasso finis,     Molli divinis.     O mi de armis tres,     Imi nadis tres,     Cantu disco ver     Meas alo ver?           CXLVIII.--A HAPPY SUGGESTION.  WHEN Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, gave a concert to the Consumption Hospital, the proceeds of which concert amounted to 1,776l. 15s., and were to be devoted to the completion of the building, Jerrold suggested that the new part of the hospital should be called \"The Nightingale's Wing.\"           CXLIX.--PLAYING ON A WORD.  LORD ORFORD was present in a large company at dinner, when Bruce, the celebrated traveller, was talking in his usual style of exaggeration. Some one asked him what musical instruments were used in Abyssinia. Bruce hesitated, not being prepared for the question, and at last said, \"I think I saw a _lyre_ there.\" George Selwyn, who was of the party, whispered his next man, \"Yes, and there is _one less_ since he left the country.\"           CL.--AN EYE TO PROFIT.  A PERSON speaking of an acquaintance, who,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#6)"],["body"," though extremely avaricious, was always abusing the avarice of others, added, \"Is it not strange that this man will not take the _beam out of his own eye_ before he attempts the _mote_ in other people's?\"--\"Why, so I daresay he would,\" cried Sheridan, \"if he was sure of _selling the timber_.\"           CLI.--\"OUT, BRIEF CANDLE.\"  A VERY small officer struck an old grenadier of his company for some supposed fault in performing his evolutions. The grenadier gravely took off his cap, and, holding it over the officer by the tip, said, \"Sir, if you were not my officer, I would _extinguish_ you.\"           CLII.--A.I.  A LEARNED barrister, quoting Latin verses to a brother \"wig,\" who did not appear to understand them, added, \"Don't you know the lines? They are in Martial.\"--\"Marshall. Oh, yes; Marshall, who wrote on underwriting.\"--\"Not so bad,\" replied the other. \"After all, there is not so much difference between an _under writer_ and a _minor_ poet.\"           CLIII.--QUALIFYING FOR BAIL.  A GENTLEMAN once appeared in the Court of King's Bench to give bail in the sum of 3,000l. Serjeant Davy, wanting to display his wit, said to him, sternly, \"And pray, sir, how do you make out that you are worth 3,000l.?\" The gentleman stated the particulars of his property up to 2,940. \"That's all very good,\" said the serjeant, \"but you want 60l. more to be worth 3,000.\"--\"For that sum,\" replied the gentleman, in no ways disconcerted, \"I have a note of hand of one Mr. Serjeant Davy, and I hope he will have the honesty soon to settle it.\" The serjeant looked abashed, and Lord Mansfield observed, in his usual urbane tone, \"Well, brother Davy, I _think_ we may accept the bail.\"           CLIV.--BARRY'S POWERS OF PLEASING.  SPRANGER BARRY, to his silver-toned voice, added all the powers of persuasion. A carpenter, to whom he owed some money for work at the Dublin Theatre, called at Barry's house, and was very clamorous in demanding payment. Mr. Barry overhearing him, said from above, \"Don't be in a passion; but do me the favor to walk upstairs, and we'll speak on the business.\"--\"Not I,\" answered the man; \"you owe me one hundred pounds already, and if you get me upstairs, you won't let me leave you till you owe me _two_.\"           CLV.--EPIGRAM.  \"IT is rumored that a certain Royal Duke has expressed a determination never to shave until the Reform Bill is crushed entirely.\"--_Court Journal_.      'Tis right that Cumberland should be     In this resolve so steady,     For all the world declare that he     Is _too bare-faced_ already!           CLVI.--SENTENCE OF DEATH.  THE following is a literal copy of a notice served by a worthy inhabitant of Gravesend upon his neighbor, whose fowl had eaten his pig's victuals.  \"SIR,--I have sent to you as Coashon a gences Leting your fouls Coming Eting and destrowing My Pegs vettles and if so be you Let them Com on My Premses hafter this Noddes I will kil them.                                                               \"RD. GOLD.\"           CLVII.--NATIVE WIT.  JOHN was thought to be very stupid. He was sent to a mill one day, and the miller said, \"John, some people say you are a fool! Now, tell me what you do know, and what you don't know.\"--\"Well,\" replied John, \"I know millers' hogs are fat!\"--\"Yes, that's well, John! Now, what don't you know?\"--\"I don't know _whose corn_ fats 'em!\"           CLVIII.--WORTH THE MONEY.  SIR ROBERT WALPOLE having misquoted a passage in Horace, Mr. Pulteney said the honorable gentleman's Latin was as bad as his politics. Sir Robert adhered to his version, and bet his opponent a guinea that he was right, proposing Mr. Harding as arbiter. The bet being accepted, Harding rose, and with ludicrous solemnity gave his decision against his patron. The guinea was thrown across the House; and when Pulteney stooped to pick it up, he observed, that \"it was the first _public money_ he had touched for a long time.\" After his death, the guinea was found wrapped up in a piece of paper on which the circumstance was recorded.           CLIX.--SUITED TO HIS SUBJECT.  THE ballot was, it seems, first proposed in 1795, by Major _Cart-wright_, who somewhat appropriately wrote a book upon the _Common-Wheel_.           CLX.--NOT _versus_ NOTT.  A GENTLEMAN of Maudlin, whose name was _Nott_, returning late from his friend's rooms, attracted the attention of the proctor, who demanded his name and college. \"I am _Nott_ of Maudlin,\" was the reply, hiccupping. \"Sir,\" said the proctor, in an angry tone, \"I did not ask of what college you are _not_, but of what college you are.\"--\"I am _Nott_ of Maudlin,\" was again the broken reply. The proctor, enraged at what he considered contumely, insisted on accompanying him to Maudlin, and demanded of the porter, \"whether he knew the gentleman.\"--\"Know him, sir,\" said the porter, \"yes, it is Mr. _Nott_ of this college.\" The proctor now perceived his error in _not_ understanding the gentleman, and wished him a good night.           CLXI.--A COCKNEY EPIGRAM.      In Parliament, it's plain enough,       No reverence for age appears;     For they who hear each speaker's _stuff_,       Find there is no respect for _(y) ears_.           CLXII.--THE PINK OF POLITENESS.  LORD BERKELEY was once dining with Lord Chesterfield (the pink of politeness) and a large party, when it was usual to drink wine until they were mellow. Berkeley had by accident shot one of his gamekeepers, and Chesterfield, under the warmth of wine, said, \"Pray, my Lord Berkeley, how long is it since you shot a gamekeeper?\"--\"Not since you hanged _your tutor_, my lord!\" was the reply. You know that Lord Chesterfield brought Dr. Dodd to trial, in consequence of which he was hanged.           CLXIII.--HIGH AND LOW.  \"I EXPECT six clergymen to dine with me on such a day,\" said a gentleman to his butler. \"Very good, sir,\" said the butler. \"Are they High Church or Low Church, sir?\"--\"What on earth can that signify to you?\" asked the astonished master. \"Every thing, sir,\" was the reply. \"If they are High Church, they'll drink; if they are Low Church, _they'll eat_!\"           CLXIV.--CITY LOVE.      IN making love let poor men sigh,       But love that's ready-made is better     For men of business;--so I,       If madam will be cruel, let her.     But should she wish that I should wait       And miss the 'Change,--oh no, I thank her,     I court by _deed_, or after _date_,       Through my solicitor or banker.           CLXV.--INGENIOUS REPLY OF A SOLDIER.  A SOLDIER in the army of the Duke of Marlborough took the name of that general, who reprimanded him for it. \"How am I to blame, general?\" said the soldier. \"I have the choice of names; if I had known one more illustrious _than yours_, I should have taken it.\"           CLXVI.--LORD CHESTERFIELD.  WHEN Lord Chesterfield was in administration, he proposed a person to his late majesty as proper to fill a place of great trust, but which the king himself was determined should be filled by another. The council, however, resolved not to indulge the king, for fear of a dangerous precedent, and it was Lord Chesterfield's business to present the grant of office for the king's signature. Not to incense his majesty by asking him abruptly, he, with accents of great humility, begged to know with whose name his majesty would be pleased to have the blanks filled up. \"With the _devil's_!\" replied the king, in a paroxysm of rage. \"And shall the instrument,\" said the Earl, coolly, \"run as usual, _Our trusty and well-beloved cousin and counsellor_?\"--a repartee at which the king laughed heartily, and with great good-humor signed the grant.           CLXVII.--SPECIAL PLEADING.  WHEN a very eminent special pleader was asked by a country gentleman if he considered that his son was likely to succeed as a special pleader, he replied, \"Pray, sir, can your son _eat saw-dust without butter_?\"           CLXVIII.--ON A NEW DUKE.      ASK you why gold and velvet bind       The temples of that cringing thief?     Is it so strange a thing to find       A toad beneath a strawberry leaf?           CLXIX.--THE ZODIAC CLUB.  ON the occasion of starting a convivial club, somebody proposed that it should consist of twelve members, and be called \"The Zodiac,\" each member to be named after a sign.  \"And what shall I be?\" inquired a somewhat solemn man, who was afraid that his name would be forgotten.  _Jerrold._--\"Oh, we'll bring you in as the _weight_ in Libra.\"           CLXX.--QUIN'S SOLILOQUY ON SEEING THE EMBALMED BODY OF DUKE         HUMPHREY, AT ST. ALBAN'S.      \"A PLAGUE on Egypt's arts, I say--     Embalm the dead--on senseless clay       Rich wine and spices waste:     Like sturgeon, or like brawn, shall I,     Bound in a precious pickle lie,       Which I can never taste!     Let me embalm this flesh of mine,     With turtle fat, and Bourdeaux wine,       And spoil the Egyptian trade,     Than Glo'ster's Duke, more happy I,     Embalm'd alive, old Quin shall lie       A mummy ready made.\"           CLXXI.--STRIKING REPROOF.  IT being reported that Lady Caroline Lamb had, in a moment of passion, knocked down one of her pages with a stool, the poet Moore, to whom this was told by Lord Strangford, observed: \"Oh! nothing is more natural for a literary lady than to double down a page.\"--\"I would rather,\" replied his lordship, \"advise Caroline to _turn over a new leaf_.\"           CLXXII.--A PRETTY PICTURE.  E---- taking the portrait of a lady, perceived that when he was working at her mouth she was trying to render it smaller by contracting her lips. \"Do not trouble yourself so much, madam,\" exclaimed the painter; \"if you please, I will draw your face _without any mouth_ at all.\"           CLXXIII.--UNKNOWN TONGUE.  DURING the long French war, two old ladies in Stranraer were going to the kirk, the one said to the other, \"Was it no a wonderfu' thing that the Breetish were aye victorious ower the French in battle?\"--\"Not a bit,\" said the other old lady, \"dinna ye ken the"]]]
