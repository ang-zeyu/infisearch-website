Henry the Fifth was the son of Henry of Bolinbroke and Mary daughter of Humfrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford. No direct and positive evidence has yet been discovered to fix with unerring accuracy the day or the place of his birth. If however we assume the statement of the chroniclers[2] to be true, that he was born at Monmouth on the ninth day of August in the year 1387,[3] history supplies many ascertained facts not only consistent with that hypothesis, but in             (p. 002) confirmation of it; whilst none are found to throw upon it the faintest shade of improbability. At first sight it might perhaps appear strange that the exact time of the birth as well of Henry of Monmouth, as of his father, two successive kings of England, should even yet remain the subject of conjecture, tradition, and inference; whilst the day and place of the birth of Henry VI. is matter of historical record. A single reflection, however, on the circumstances of their respective births, renders the absence of all precise testimony in the one case natural; whilst it would have been altogether unintelligible in the other. When Henry of Bolinbroke and Henry of Monmouth were born, their fathers were subjects, and nothing of national interest was at the time associated with their appearance in the world; at Henry of Windsor's birth he was the acknowledged heir to the throne both of England and of France.                     [Footnote 2: Monomothi in Wallia natus v. Id.                    Aug.--Pauli Jov. Ang. Reg. Chron.; William of                    Worcester, &c.]                     [Footnote 3: At the foot of the Wardrobe Account of                    Henry Earl of Derby from 30th September 1387 to                    30th September 1388, (and unfortunately no account                    of the Duke of Lancaster's expenses is as yet found                    extant before that very year,) an item occurs of                    341_l._ 12_s._ 5_d._, paid 24th September 1386, for                    the household expenses of the Earl and his family                    at Monmouth. This proves that his father made the                    castle of Monmouth his residence within less than a                    year of the date assigned for Henry's birth.]  To what extent Henry of Monmouth's future character and conduct were, under Providence, affected by the circumstances of his family and its several members, it would perhaps be less philosophical than presumptuous to define. But, that those circumstances were         (p. 003) peculiarly calculated to influence him in his principles and views and actions, will be acknowledged by every one who becomes acquainted with them, and who is at the same time in the least degree conversant with the growth and workings of the human mind. It must, therefore, fall within the province of the inquiry instituted in these pages, to take a brief review of the domestic history of Henry's family through the years of his childhood and early youth.  John, surnamed \"of Gaunt,\" from Ghent or Gand in Flanders, the place of his birth, was the fourth son of King Edward the Third. At a very early age he married Blanche, daughter and heiress of Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Lancaster, great-grandson of Henry the Third.[4] The time of his marriage with Blanche,[5] though recorded with sufficient precision, is indeed comparatively of little consequence; whilst the date of their son Henry's birth, from the influence which the age of a father may have on the destinies of his child, becomes matter of much importance to those who take any interest in the    (p. 004) history of their grandson, Henry of Monmouth. On this point it has been already intimated that no conclusive evidence is directly upon record. The principal facts, however, which enable us to draw an inference of high probability, are associated with so pleasing and so exemplary a custom, though now indeed fallen into great desuetude among us, that to review them compensates for any disappointment which might be felt from the want of absolute certainty in the issue of our research. It was Henry of Bolinbroke's custom[6] every year on the Feast of the Lord's Supper, that is, on the Thursday before Easter, to clothe as many poor persons as equalled the number of years which he had completed on the preceding birthday; and by examining the accounts still preserved in the archives of the Duchy of Lancaster, the details of which would be altogether uninteresting in this place, we are led to infer that Henry Bolinbroke was born on the 4th of April 1366. Blanche, his mother, survived the birth of Bolinbroke probably not more than three years. Whether this lady found in John of Gaunt a faithful and loving husband, or whether his libertinism caused her to pass her short life in disappointment and sorrow, no authentic document enables us to pronounce. It is, however, impossible to close our eyes against the painful fact, that Catherine Swynford, who    (p. 005) was the partner of his guilt during the life of his second wife, Constance, had been an inmate of his family, as the confidential attendant on his wife Blanche, and the governess of her daughters, Philippa and Elizabeth of Lancaster. That he afterwards, by a life of abandoned profligacy, disgraced the religion which he professed, is, unhappily, put beyond conjecture or vague rumour. Though we cannot infer from any expenses about her funeral and her memory, that Blanche was the sole object of his affections, (the most lavish costliness at the tomb of the departed too often being only in proportion to the unkindness shown to the living,) yet it may be worth observing, that in 1372 we find an entry in the account, of 20_l._ paid to two chaplains (together with the expenses of the altar) to say masses for her soul. He was then already[7] married to his second wife, Constance, daughter of Peter the Cruel, King of Castile. By this lady, whom he often calls \"the Queen,\" he appears to have had only one child, married, it is said, to Henry III. King of Castile.[8] Constance, the mother, is represented to have been one of the most (p. 006) amiable and exemplary persons of the age, \"above other women innocent and devout;\" and from her husband she deserved treatment far different from what it was her unhappy lot to experience. But however severe were her sufferings, she probably concealed them within her own breast: and she neither left her husband nor abandoned her duties in disgust. It is indeed possible, though in the highest degree improbable, that whilst his unprincipled conduct was too notorious to be concealed from others, she was not herself made fully acquainted with his infidelity towards her. At all events we may indulge in the belief that she proved to her husband's only legitimate son, Henry (p. 007) of Bolinbroke, a kind and watchful mother.                     [Footnote 4: His wife's sister, Matilda, married to                    William, Duke of Holland and Zealand, dying without                    issue, John of Gaunt succeeded to the undivided                    estates and honours of the late duke.]                     [Footnote 5: Froissart reports that Henry                    Bolinbroke was a handsome young man; and declares                    that he never saw two such noble dames, nor ever                    should were he to live a thousand years, so good,                    liberal, and courteous, as his mother the Lady                    Blanche, and \"the late Queen of England,\" Philippa                    of Hainault, wife of Edward the Third. These were                    the mother, and the consort of John of Gaunt.]                     [Footnote 6: For this fact and the several items by                    which it is substantiated, the Author is indebted                    to the kindness and antiquarian researches of                    William Hardy, Esq. of the Duchy of Lancaster                    office.

The same person attended the late Duchess                    Blanche.                     The Author has lately discovered on the Pell Rolls                    a payment, dated 21st February 1373, which refers                    to the birth of a daughter, and at the same time                    informs us that his future wife was then probably a                    member of his household. \"To Catherine Swynford                    twenty marks for announcing to the King (Richard                    the Second) the birth of a daughter of the Queen of                    Spain, consort of John, King of Castile and Leon,                    and Duke of Lancaster.\"                     The marriage of John of Gaunt with Catherine                    Swynford took place only the second year after the                    death of Constance, and seems to have excited among                    the nobility equal surprise and disgust. \"The great                    ladies of England, (as Stowe reports,) as the                    Duchess of Gloucester, &c."]]]
