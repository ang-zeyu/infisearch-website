(2) See especially Professor Burney's forthcoming commentary      on Judges (passim), and his forthcoming Schweich Lectures      (now delivered, in 1917).  The great change from desert life consists in the adoption of agriculture, and when once that was made by the Hebrews any further advance in economic development was dictated by their new surroundings. The same process had been going on, as we have seen, in Syria since the dawn of history, the Semitic nomad passing gradually through the stages of agricultural and village life into that of the city. The country favoured the retention of tribal exclusiveness, but ultimate survival could only be purchased at the cost of some amalgamation with their new neighbours. Below the surface of Hebrew history these two tendencies may be traced in varying action and reaction. Some sections of the race engaged readily in the social and commercial life of Canaanite civilization with its rich inheritance from the past. Others, especially in the highlands of Judah and the south, at first succeeded in keeping themselves remote from foreign influence. During the later periods of the national life the country was again subjected, and in an intensified degree, to those forces of political aggression from Mesopotamia and Egypt which we have already noted as operating in Canaan. But throughout the settled Hebrew community as a whole the spark of desert fire was not extinguished, and by kindling the zeal of the Prophets it eventually affected nearly all the white races of mankind.  In his Presidential Address before the British Association at Newcastle,(1) Sir Arthur Evans emphasized the part which recent archaeology has played in proving the continuity of human culture from the most remote periods. He showed how gaps in our knowledge had been bridged, and he traced the part which each great race had taken in increasing its inheritance. We have, in fact, ample grounds for assuming an interchange, not only of commercial products, but, in a minor degree, of ideas within areas geographically connected; and it is surely not derogatory to any Hebrew writer to suggest that he may have adopted, and used for his own purposes, conceptions current among his contemporaries. In other words, the vehicle of religious ideas may well be of composite origin; and, in the course of our study of early Hebrew tradition, I suggest that we hold ourselves justified in applying the comparative method to some at any rate of the ingredients which went to form the finished product. The process is purely literary, but it finds an analogy in the study of Semitic art, especially in the later periods. And I think it will make my meaning clearer if we consider for a moment a few examples of sculpture produced by races of Semitic origin. I do not suggest that we should regard the one process as in any way proving the existence of the other. We should rather treat the comparison as illustrating in another medium the effect of forces which, it is clear, were operative at various periods upon races of the same stock from which the Hebrews themselves were descended. In such material products the eye at once detects the Semite's readiness to avail himself of foreign models. In some cases direct borrowing is obvious; in others, to adapt a metaphor from music, it is possible to trace extraneous _motifs_ in the design.(2)       (1) \"New Archaeological Lights on the Origins of      Civilization in Europe,\" British Association, Newcastle-on-      Tyne, 1916.       (2) The necessary omission of plates, representing the      slides shown in the lectures, has involved a recasting of      most passages in which points of archaeological detail were      discussed; see Preface. But the following paragraphs have      been retained as the majority of the monuments referred to      are well known.  Some of the most famous monuments of Semitic art date from the Persian and Hellenistic periods, and if we glance at them in this connexion it is in order to illustrate during its most obvious phase a tendency of which the earlier effects are less pronounced. In the sarcophagus of the Sidonian king Eshmu-'azar II, which is preserved in the Louvre,(1) we have indeed a monument to which no Semitic sculptor can lay claim. Workmanship and material are Egyptian, and there is no doubt that it was sculptured in Egypt and transported to Sidon by sea. But the king's own engravers added the long Phoenician inscription, in which he adjures princes and men not to open his resting-place since there are no jewels therein, concluding with some potent curses against any violation of his tomb. One of the latter implores the holy gods to deliver such violators up \"to a mighty prince who shall rule over them\", and was probably suggested by Alexander's recent occupation of Sidon in 332 B.C. after his reduction and drastic punishment of Tyre. King Eshmun-'zar was not unique in his choice of burial in an Egyptian coffin, for he merely followed the example of his royal father, Tabnîth, \"priest of 'Ashtart and king of the Sidonians\", whose sarcophagus, preserved at Constantinople, still bears in addition to his own epitaph that of its former occupant, a certain Egyptian general Penptah. But more instructive than these borrowed memorials is a genuine example of Phoenician work, the stele set up by Yehaw-milk, king of Byblos, and dating from the fourth or fifth century B.C.(2) In the sculptured panel at the head of the stele the king is represented in the Persian dress of the period standing in the presence of 'Ashtart or Astarte, his \"Lady, Mistress of Byblos\". There is no doubt that the stele is of native workmanship, but the influence of Egypt may be seen in the technique of the carving, in the winged disk above the figures, and still more in the representation of the goddess in her character as the Egyptian Hathor, with disk and horns, vulture head-dress and papyrus-sceptre. The inscription records the dedication of an altar and shrine to the goddess, and these too we may conjecture were fashioned on Egyptian lines.       (1) _Corp. Inscr. Semit._, I. i, tab. II.       (2) _C.I.S._, I. i, tab. I.  The representation of Semitic deities under Egyptian forms and with Egyptian attributes was encouraged by the introduction of their cults into Egypt itself. In addition to Astarte of Byblos, Ba'al, Anath, and Reshef were all borrowed from Syria in comparatively early times and given Egyptian characters. The conical Syrian helmet of Reshef, a god of war and thunder, gradually gave place to the white Egyptian crown, so that as Reshpu he was represented as a royal warrior; and Qadesh, another form of Astarte, becoming popular with Egyptian women as a patroness of love and fecundity, was also sometimes modelled on Hathor.(1)       (1) See W. Max Müller, _Egyptological Researches_, I, p. 32      f., pl. 41, and S. A. Cook, _Religion of Ancient Palestine_,      pp. 83 ff.  Semitic colonists on the Egyptian border were ever ready to adopt Egyptian symbolism in delineating the native gods to whom they owed allegiance, and a particularly striking example of this may be seen on a stele of the Persian period preserved in the Cairo Museum.(1) It was found at Tell Defenneh, on the right bank of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, close to the old Egyptian highway into Syria, a site which may be identified with that of the biblical Tahpanhes and the Daphnae of the Greeks. Here it was that the Jewish fugitives, fleeing with Jeremiah after the fall of Jerusalem, founded a Jewish colony beside a flourishing Phoenician and Aramaean settlement. One of the local gods of Tahpanhes is represented on the Cairo monument, an Egyptian stele in the form of a naos with the winged solar disk upon its frieze. He stands on the back of a lion and is clothed in Asiatic costume with the high Syrian tiara crowning his abundant hair. The Syrian workmanship is obvious, and the Syrian character of the cult may be recognized in such details as the small brazen fire-altar before the god, and the sacred pillar which is being anointed by the officiating priest. But the god holds in his left hand a purely Egyptian sceptre and in his right an emblem as purely Babylonian, the weapon of Marduk and Gilgamesh which was also wielded by early Sumerian kings.       (1) Müller, op. cit., p. 30 f., pl. 40. Numismatic evidence      exhibits a similar readiness on the part of local Syrian      cults to adopt the veneer of Hellenistic civilization while      retaining in great measure their own individuality; see      Hill, \"Some Palestinian Cults in the Graeco-Roman Age\", in      _Proceedings of the British Academy_, Vol. V (1912).  The Elephantine papyri have shown that the early Jews of the Diaspora, though untrammeled by the orthodoxy of Jerusalem, maintained the purity of their local cult in the face of considerable difficulties. Hence the gravestones of their Aramaean contemporaries, which have been found in Egypt, can only be cited to illustrate the temptations to which they were exposed.(1) Such was the memorial erected by Abseli to the memory of his parents, Abbâ and Ahatbû, in the fourth year of Xerxes, 481 B.C.(2) They had evidently adopted the religion of Osiris, and were buried at Saqqârah in accordance with the Egyptian rites. The upper scene engraved upon the stele represents Abbâ and his wife in the presence of Osiris, who is attended by Isis and Nephthys; and in the lower panel is the funeral scene, in which all the mourners with one exception are Asiatics. Certain details of the rites that are represented, and mistakes in the hieroglyphic version of the text, prove that the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],["title","Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#4)"],["body","is Aramaean throughout.(3)       (1) It may be admitted that the Greek platonized cult of      Isis and Osiris had its origin in the fusion of Greeks and      Egyptians which took place in Ptolemaic times (cf. Scott-      Moncrieff, _Paganism and Christianity in Egypt_, p. 33 f.).      But we may assume that already in the Persian period the      Osiris cult had begun to acquire a tinge of mysticism,      which, though it did not affect the mechanical reproduction      of the native texts, appealed to the Oriental mind as well      as to certain elements in Greek religion. Persian influence      probably prepared the way for the Platonic exegesis of the      Osiris and Isis legends which we find in Plutarch; and the      latter may have been in great measure a development, and      not, as is often assumed, a complete misunderstanding of the      later Egyptian cult.       (2) _C.I.S._, II. i, tab. XI, No. 122.       (3) A very similar monument is the Carpentras Stele      (_C.I.S._, II., i, tab. XIII, No. 141), commemorating Taba,      daughter of Tahapi, an Aramaean lady who was also a convert      to Osiris. It is rather later than that of Abbâ and his      wife, since the Aramaic characters are transitional from the      archaic to the square alphabet; see Driver, _Notes on the      Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel_, pp. xviii ff., and      Cooke, _North Semitic Inscriptions_, p. 205 f. The Vatican      Stele (op. cit. tab. XIV. No. 142), which dates from the      fourth century, represents inferior work.  If our examples of Semitic art were confined to the Persian and later periods, they could only be employed to throw light on their own epoch, when through communication had been organized, and there was consequently a certain pooling of commercial and artistic products throughout the empire.(1) It is true that under the Great King the various petty states and provinces were encouraged to manage their own affairs so long as they paid the required tribute, but their horizon naturally expanded with increase of commerce and the necessity for service in the king's armies. At this time Aramaic was the speech of Syria, and the population, especially in the cities, was still largely Aramaean. As early as the thirteenth century sections of this interesting Semitic race had begun to press into Northern Syria from the middle Euphrates, and they absorbed not only the old Canaanite population but also the Hittite immigrants from Cappadocia. The latter indeed may for a time have furnished rulers to the vigorous North Syrian principalities which resulted from this racial combination, but the Aramaean element, thanks to continual reinforcement, was numerically dominant, and their art may legitimately be regarded as in great measure a Semitic product. Fortunately we have recovered examples of sculpture which prove that tendencies already noted in the Persian period were at work, though in a minor degree, under the later Assyrian empire. The discoveries made at Zenjirli, for example, illustrate the gradually increasing effect of Assyrian influence upon the artistic output of a small North Syrian state.       (1) Cf. Bevan, _House of Seleucus_, Vol. I, pp. 5, 260 f.      The artistic influence of Mesopotamia was even more widely      spread than that of Egypt during the Persian period. This is      suggested, for example, by the famous lion-weight discovered      at Abydos in Mysia, the town on the Hellespont famed for the      loves of Hero and Leander. The letters of its Aramaic      inscription (_C.I.S._, II. i, tab. VII, No. 108) prove by      their form that it dates from the Persian period, and its      provenance is sufficiently attested. Its weight moreover      suggests that it was not merely a Babylonian or Persian      importation, but cast for local use, yet in design and      technique it is scarcely distinguishable from the best      Assyrian work of the seventh century.  This village in north-western Syria, on the road between Antioch and Mar'ash, marks the site of a town which lay near the southern border or just within the Syrian district of Sam'al. The latter is first mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions by Shalmaneser III, the son and successor of the great conqueror, Ashur-nasir-pal; and in the first half of the eighth century, though within the radius of Assyrian influence, it was still an independent kingdom. It is to this period that we must assign the earliest of the inscribed monuments discovered at Zenjirli and its neighbourhood. At Gerjin, not far to the north-west, was found the colossal statue of Hadad, chief god of the Aramaeans, which was fashioned and set up in his honour by Panammu I, son of Qaral and king of Ya'di.(1) In the long Aramaic inscription engraved upon the statue Panammu records the prosperity of his reign, which he ascribes to the support he has received from Hadad and his other gods, El, Reshef, Rekub-el, and Shamash. He had evidently been left in peace by Assyria, and the monument he erected to his god is of Aramaean workmanship and design. But the influence of Assyria may be traced in Hadad's beard and in his horned head-dress, modelled on that worn by Babylonian and Assyrian gods as the symbol of divine power.       (1) See F. von Luschan, _Sendschirli_, I. (1893), pp. 49      ff., pl. vi; and cf. Cooke, _North Sem. Inscr._, pp. 159 ff.      The characters of the inscription on the statue are of the      same archaic type as those of the Moabite Stone, though      unlike them they are engraved in relief; so too are the      inscriptions of Panammu's later successor Bar-rekub (see      below). Gerjin was certainly in Ya'di, and Winckler's      suggestion that Zenjirli itself also lay in that district      but near the border of Sam'al may be provisionally accepted;      the occurrence of the names in the inscriptions can be      explained in more than one way (see Cooke, op. cit., p.      183).  The political changes introduced into Ya'di and Sam'al by Tiglath-pileser IV are reflected in the inscriptions and monuments of Bar-rekub, a later king of the district. Internal strife had brought disaster upon Ya'di and the throne had been secured by Panammu II, son of Bar-sur, whose claims received Assyrian support. In the words of his son Bar-rekub, \"he laid hold of the skirt of his lord, the king of Assyria\", who was gracious to him; and it was probably at this time, and as a reward for his loyalty, that Ya'di was united with the neighbouring district of Sam'al. But Panammu's devotion to his foreign master led to his death, for he died at the siege of Damascus, in 733 or 732 B.C., \"in the camp, while following his lord, Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria\". His kinsfolk and the whole camp bewailed him, and his body was sent back to Ya'di, where it was interred by his son, who set up an inscribed statue to his memory. Bar-rekub followed in his father's footsteps, as he leads us to infer in his palace-inscription found at Zenjirli: \"I ran at the wheel of my lord, the king of Assyria, in the midst of mighty kings, possessors of silver and possessors of gold.\" It is not strange therefore that his art should reflect Assyrian influence far more strikingly than that of Panammu I. The figure of himself which he caused to be carved in relief on the left side of the palace-inscription is in the Assyrian style,(1) and so too is another of his reliefs from Zenjirli. On the latter Bar-rekub is represented seated upon his throne with eunuch and scribe in attendance, while in the field is the emblem of full moon and crescent, here ascribed to \"Ba'al of Harran\", the famous centre of moon-worship in Northern Mesopotamia.(2)       (1) _Sendschirli_, IV (1911), pl. lxvii. Attitude and      treatment of robes are both Assyrian, and so is the      arrangement of divine symbols in the upper field, though      some of the latter are given under unfamiliar forms. The      king's close-fitting peaked cap was evidently the royal      headdress of Sam'al; see the royal figure on a smaller stele      of inferior design, op. cit., pl. lxvi.       (2) Op. cit. pp. 257, 346 ff., and pl. lx. The general style      of the sculpture and much of the detail are obviously      Assyrian. Assyrian influence is particularly noticeable in      Bar-rekub's throne; the details of its decoration are      precisely similar to those of an Assyrian bronze throne in      the British Museum. The full moon and crescent are not of      the familiar form, but are mounted on a standard with      tassels.  The detailed history and artistic development of Sam'al and Ya'di convey a very vivid impression of the social and material effects upon the native population of Syria, which followed the westward advance of Assyria in the eighth century. We realize not only the readiness of one party in the state to defeat its rival with the help of Assyrian support, but also the manner in which the life and activities of the nation as a whole were unavoidably affected by their action. Other Hittite-Aramaean and Phoenician monuments, as yet undocumented with literary records, exhibit a strange but not unpleasing mixture of foreign _motifs_, such as we see on the stele from Amrith(1) in the inland district of Arvad. But perhaps the most remarkable example of Syrian art we possess is the king's gate recently discovered at Carchemish.(2) The presence of the hieroglyphic inscriptions points to the survival of Hittite tradition, but the figures represented in the reliefs are of Aramaean, not Hittite, type. Here the king is seen leading his eldest son by the hand in some stately ceremonial, and ranged in registers behind them are the younger members of the royal family, whose ages are indicated by their occupations.(3) The employment of basalt in place of limestone does not disguise the sculptor's debt to Assyria. But the design is entirely his own, and the combined dignity and homeliness of the composition are refreshingly superior to the"]]]
