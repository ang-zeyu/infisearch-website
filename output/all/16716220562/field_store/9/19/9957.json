She derived, however,       great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from       the reflection that much of the history remained still untold,       and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for       him a most righteous reward, in depriving him of many       inconceivable adventures.     A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.     The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways;    nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the   vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have   a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.  —_Joseph Glanville_.        We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some       minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.        “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you       on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about       three years past, there happened to me an event such as never       happened to mortal man—or at least such as no man ever survived       to tell of—and the six hours of deadly terror which I then       endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a _very_       old man—but I am not. It took less than a single day to change       these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and       to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,       and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look       over this little cliff without getting giddy?”        The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown       himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung       over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his       elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose,       a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some       fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath       us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of       its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous       position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the       ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance       upward at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of       the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger       from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason       myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the       distance.        “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have       brought you here that you might have the best possible view of       the scene of that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole       story with the spot just under your eye.”        “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which       distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in       the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of       Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon       whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up       a little higher—hold on to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and       look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.”        I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose       waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the       Nubian geographer’s account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama       more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To       the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay       outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black       and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more       forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its       white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just       opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a       distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible       a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position       was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was       enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of       smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at       various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.        The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more       distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about       it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward       that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed       trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,       still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a       short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction—as       well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was       little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.        “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by       the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to       the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,       Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and       Vurrgh—are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These       are the true names of the places—but why it has been thought       necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can       understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in the       water?”        We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to       which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we       had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from       the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and       gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of       buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I       perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_ character of the       ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set       to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a       monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its       headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as       Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between       Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the       vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand       conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied       convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and       innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the       eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes       except in precipitous descents.        In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical       alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and       the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks       of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These       streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and       entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory       motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of       another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this assumed a distinct       and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in       diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt       of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth       of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could       fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water,       inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,       speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering       motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half       shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of       Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.        The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I       threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an       excess of nervous agitation.        “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this _can_ be nothing       else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”        “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the       Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”        The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me       for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most       circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception       either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene—or of       the wild bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the       beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in       question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have       been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are       some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be       quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly       feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.        “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is       between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side,       toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a       convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on       the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is       flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe       with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to       the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful       cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the       vortices or pits are of such an extent and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#0)"],["body","Works of Edgar Allan Poe  by Edgar Allan Poe  The Raven Edition  VOLUME III.

GORDON PYM  INTRODUCTORY NOTE        Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the       extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and       elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,       accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in       Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to       the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon       me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several       reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a       nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;       others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was       that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time       in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,       from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have       the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring       only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us       are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence       in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that       the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively       marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be       (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a       half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,       and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put       faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at       large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent       and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer       was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me       from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.        Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest       interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that       portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,       lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly       magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of       Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at       once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust       to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with       great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere       authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if       there were any, would give it all the better chance of being       received as truth.        Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to       do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would       not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in       his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my       adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the       “Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,       perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my       real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended       fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January       and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be       regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the       articles in the table of contents of the magazine.        The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at       length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the       adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of       fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of       my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering       or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all       disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to       Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the       contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would       prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence       of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to       fear on the score of popular incredulity.        This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what       follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be       understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages       which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not       seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where       his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of       style will be readily perceived.  A. G. PYM.     CHAPTER 1         My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader       in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal       grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in       every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of       the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and       other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He       was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person       in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property       at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of       old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric       manners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited       New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I       left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became       intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who       generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.       Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many       relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,       and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a       whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was       always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific       Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,       and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would       be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories       of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had       visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested       in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go       to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about       seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was       rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten       persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit       of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I       now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am       alive to-day.        I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a       longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party       at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little       intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I       took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to       sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the       party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.       It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in       bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly       started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go       to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so       glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished       in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the       wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside       himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he       knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more       sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed       on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and       dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell       what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth       than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and       thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most       reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and       the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out       of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was       quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying       in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as       any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.        We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to       the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the       lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out       against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for       she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted       jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.        The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The     "]]]
