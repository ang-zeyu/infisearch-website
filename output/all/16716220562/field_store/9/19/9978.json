Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet       of age. His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the       Lady Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that       time, in his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long       period—a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in       a wilderness—in so magnificent a wilderness as that old       principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.        From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of       his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former,       entered immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were       seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were       without number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the       “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line of his dominions was       never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit       of fifty miles.        Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so       well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was       afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,       for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded       Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most       enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries—flagrant       treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave his trembling vassals       quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part—no       punctilios of conscience on his own—were thenceforward to prove       any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.       On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle       Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous       opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to       the already hideous list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and       enormities.        But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young       nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast       and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of       Metzengerstein. The rich although faded tapestry hangings which       swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and       majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _Here_,       rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly       seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the       wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal       supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. _There_, the       dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular       war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes—startled       the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_,       again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days       gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the       strains of imaginary melody.        But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the       gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or       perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of       audacity—his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an       enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the       tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his       rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood       motionless and statue-like—while farther back, its discomfited       rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.        On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became       aware of the direction which his glance had, without his       consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the       contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming       anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It       was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent       feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed       the more absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it       appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the       fascination of that tapestry. But the tumult without becoming       suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his       attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming       stables upon the windows of the apartment.        The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned       mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,       the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its       position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in       compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now       extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The       eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human       expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and       the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full       view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.        Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.       As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the       chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the       quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow—as       he staggered awhile upon the threshold—assuming the exact       position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless       and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.        To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into       the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered       three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril       of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a       gigantic and fiery-colored horse.        “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a       querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware       that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very       counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.        “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries,       “at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,       all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of       the Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the       old Count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.       But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is       strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow       escape from the flames.        “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his       forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of       course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at       the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”        “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air,       and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is,       as you say, a remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as       you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable       character; let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause,       “perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even       the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”        “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,       is _not_ from the stables of the Count. If such had been the       case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence       of a noble of your family.”        “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of       the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and       a precipitate step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account       of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry,       in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time,       into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but       from the low tone of voice in which these latter were       communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of       the equerries.        The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a       variety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure,       and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his       countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber       should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own       possession.        “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter       Berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after       the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had       adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,       down the long avenue which extended from the château to the       stables of Metzengerstein.        “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead!       say you?”        “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will       be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”        A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How       died he?”        “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his       hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”        “I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and       deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.        “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.        “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the       château.        From this date a marked alteration took"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2150"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 4 (#6)"],["body"," in the outward       demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von       Metzengerstein. Indeed, his behavior disappointed every       expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of       many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still       less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the       neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the       limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was       utterly companionless—unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous,       and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually       bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.        Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long       time, however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our       festivals with his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a       hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein does not hunt;”       “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic       answers.        These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious       nobility. Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in       time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count       Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron       might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he       disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not       wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” This to       be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and       merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to       become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.        The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the       conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for       the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his       atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period       immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed,       who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.       Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician)       did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary       ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were       current among the multitude.        Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired       charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from       every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like       propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,       a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead       hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the       young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that       colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded       with his own spirit.        There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late       events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania       of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space       passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and       was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest       expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no       particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his       collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His       stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with       regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the       owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the       enclosure of that particular stall. It was also to be observed,       that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he       fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in       arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose—yet no       one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had,       during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter,       actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of       peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and       high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting       unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to       the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the       sagacity of a horse—but there were certain circumstances which       intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and       phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal       caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from       the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp—times when       the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the       rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking       eye.        Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to       doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on       the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his       horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little       page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose       opinions were of the least possible importance. He—if his ideas       are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery to assert that his       master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and       almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from       every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of       triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.        One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy       slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting       in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An       occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his       return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his       domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and       magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were       discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under       the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.        As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a       progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building       were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly       around in silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful       object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved       how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings       of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought       about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.        Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the       main entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an       unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an       impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest.        The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,       uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive       struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but       no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated       lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of       terror. One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded       sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the       shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a single plunge       the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering       staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid       the whirlwind of chaotic fire.        The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm       sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building       like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere,       shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke       settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal       figure of—_a horse_.     THE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER         During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme       southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles       of a certain _Maison de Santé_ or private mad-house, about which       I had heard much, in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had       never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too       good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a       gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days       before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look       through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in       the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the       sight of a lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere       courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my       curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I       might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the       next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be       some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and       mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact,       unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur       Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty       might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private       mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. For       himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the       acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride       up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the       subject of lunacy would not"]]]
