He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco.  Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them.  The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage.  Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm.  Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel.  [Illustration: A FEW OF PENN'S PEOPLE.]  But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid.  Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695.  In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718.  Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man.  In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also.  Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief. Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying.  It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy.  After Penn's death his heirs ran the Colony up to 1779, when they disposed of it for five hundred thousand dollars or thereabouts, and the State became the proprietor.  [Illustration: PENN AND THE BIG CHIEF.]  The seventeenth century must have been a very disagreeable period for people who professed religion, for America from Newfoundland to Florida was dotted with little settlements almost entirely made up of people who had escaped from England to secure religious freedom at the risk of their lives.  In 1634 the first settlement was made by young Lord Baltimore, whose people, the Catholics, were fleeing from England to obtain freedom to worship God as they believed to be right. Thus the Catholics were added to the list of religious refugees,--viz., the Huguenots, the Puritans, the Walloons, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the Whigs, and the Menthol Healers.  Terra Mariæ, or Maryland, was granted to Lord Baltimore, as the successor of his father, who had begun before his death the movement for settling his people in America. The charter gave to all freemen a voice in making the laws. Among the first laws passed was one giving to every human being upon payment of poll-tax the right to worship freely according to the dictates of his own conscience. America thus became the refuge for those who had any peculiarity of religious belief, until to-day no doubt more varieties of religion may be found here than almost anywhere else in the world.  In 1635 the Virginia Colony and Lord Baltimore had some words over the boundaries between the Jamestown and Maryland Colonies. Clayborne was the Jamestown man who made the most trouble. He had started a couple of town sites on the Maryland tract, plotted them, and sold lots to Yorkshire tenderfeet, and so when Lord Baltimore claimed the lands Clayborne attacked him, and there was a running skirmish for several years, till at last the Rebellion collapsed in 1645 and Clayborne fled.  The Protestants now held the best hand, and outvoted the Catholics, so up to 1691 there was a never-dying fight between the two, which must have been entertaining to the unregenerate outsider who was taxed to pay for a double set of legislators. This fight between the Catholics and Protestants shows that intolerance is not confined to a monarchy.  In 1715 the fourth Lord Baltimore recovered the government by the aid of the police, and religious toleration was restored. Maryland remained under this system of government until the Revolution, which will be referred to later on in the most thrilling set of original pictures and word-paintings that the reader has ever met with.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR EXAMINATION.       _Q._ Who was William Penn?       _A._ He founded Pennsylvania.       _Q._ Was he a great fighter?       _A._ No. He was a peaceable man, and did not believe in killing men      or fighting.       _Q._ Would he have fought for a purse of forty thousand dollars?       _A._ No. He could do better buying coal lands of the Indians.       _Q._ What is religious freedom?       _A._ It is the art of giving intolerance a little more room.       _Q._ Who was Lord Baltimore?       _A._ See foregoing chapter.       _Q._ What do you understand by rebellion?       _A._ It is an unsuccessful attempt by armed subjects to overcome      the parent government.       _Q._ Is it right or wrong?       _A._ I do not know, but will go and inquire.     CHAPTER X.  THE EARLY ARISTOCRACY.   Lord Clarendon and several other noblemen in 1663 obtained from Charles II. a grant of lands lying south of Virginia which they called Carolina in honor of the king, whose name was not really Carolina. Possibly that was his middle name, however, or his name in Latin.  The Albemarle Colony was first on the ground. Then there was a Carteret Colony in 1670. They \"removed the ancient groves covered with yellow jessamine\" on the Ashley, and began to build on the present site of Charleston.  The historian remarks that the growth of this Colony was rapid from the first. The Dutch, dissatisfied with the way matters were conducted in New York, and worn out when shopping by the ennui and impudence of the salesladies, came to Charleston in large numbers, and the Huguenots in Charleston found a hearty Southern welcome, and did their trading there altogether.  We now pass on to speak of the Grand Model which was set up as a five-cent aristocracy by Lord Shaftesbury and the great philosopher John Locke. The canebrakes and swamps of the wild and snake-infested jungles of the wilderness were to be divided into vast estates, over which were proprietors with hereditary titles and outing flannels.  This scheme recognized no rights of self-government whatever, and denied the very freedom which the people came there in search of. So there were murmurings among those people who had not brought their finger-bowls and equerries with them.  [Illustration: ARISTOCRACY SNUBBED.]  In short, aristocracy did not do well on this soil. Baronial castles, with hot and cold water in them, were often neglected, because the colonists would not forsake their own lands to the thistle and blue-nosed brier in order to come and cook victuals for the baronial castles or sweep out the baronial halls and wax the baronial floors for a journeyman juke who ate custard pie with a knife and drank tea from his saucer through a King Charles moustache.  Thus the aristocracy was forced to close its doors, and the arms of Lord Shaftesbury were so humiliated that he could no longer put up his dukes (see Appendix).  There had also been a great deal of friction between the Albemarle or Carteret and the Charleston set, the former being from Virginia, while the latter was, as we have seen, a little given to kindergarten aristocracy and ofttimes tripped up on their parade swords while at the plough. Of course outside of this were the plebeian people, or copperas-culottes, who did the work; but Lord Shaftesbury for some time, as we have seen, lived in a baronial shed and had his arms worked on the left breast of his nighty.  So these two Colonies finally became separate States in the Union, though there is yet something of the same"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21448"],["title","The African Trader; Or, The Adventures of Harry Bayford (#0)"],["body","African Trader; or, The Adventures of Harry Bayford, by W.H.G. Kingston.  ________________________________________________________________________  This is rather a short book, only 120 small pages in book format.  Harry is a young chap, just about ready to leave school, when his father suffers some business losses, and the stress kills him.  Harry is left with some sisters, and he does not want to be a burden to them so he gets a job on board a trading vessel, and off they go to Africa.  Here many of the crew catch the Yellow Fever, and die.  The captain is ill, but appears to be surviving.  An African seaman is a senior rating aboard the vessel.  With a rich cargo, and badly under-manned, the vessel sets off for home.  There is a fire in one of the holds, to which the vessel succumbs.  Harry and the African seaman make themselves a raft, but the captain perishes.  They are picked up almost at once by a slave trader, but a Royal Navy man-of-war appears and gives chase.  The slave trader delays the chase by chucking slaves overboard, who then have to be picked up by the pursuer.  It all gets sorted out, and Harry's cousin is an officer on the man-of-war.  The African seaman is a religious man, and it actually turns out that he is the very person Harry had been asked to look out for by his old nurse.  So there is a happy ending, as far as Harry is concerned, but there certainly were a few casualties on the way.  ________________________________________________________________________  THE AFRICAN TRADER; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF HARRY BAYFORD, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.   CHAPTER ONE.  MY FATHER, AFTER MEETING WITH A SEVERE REVERSE OF FORTUNE, DIES, AND MY SISTERS AND I ARE LEFT DESTITUTE.--OUR FAITHFUL OLD BLACK NURSE MAMMY, TAKES CARE OF MY SISTERS, WHILE I, INVITED BY A FORMER ACQUAINTANCE, CAPTAIN WILLIS OF THE \"CHIEFTAIN,\" SAIL WITH HIM ON A TRADING VOYAGE TO THE COAST OF AFRICA.  Our school was breaking up for the midsummer holidays--north, south, east, and west we sped to our different destinations, thinking with glee of the pleasures we believed to be in store for us.  I was bound for Liverpool, where my father, a West India merchant, now resided.  He had for most of his life lived in Jamaica, where I was born, and from whence I had a few years before accompanied him to England to go to school.  \"I am sorry we shall not see you back, Bayford,\" said the good doctor, as he shook me warmly by the hand.  \"May our heavenly Father protect you, my boy, wherever you go.\"  \"I hope to go as a midshipman on board a man-of-war, sir,\" I answered. \"My father expects to get me appointed to a ship this summer, and I suppose that is the reason I am leaving.\"  The doctor looked kindly and somewhat sadly at me.  \"You must not, Harry, raise your hopes on that point too high,\" he answered, in a grave tone.  \"When I last heard from your father, saying he desired to remove you, he was very unwell.  I grieve to have to say this, but it is better that you should be prepared for evil tidings.  God bless you Harry Bayford.  The coach will soon be up; I must not detain you longer.\"  The doctor again warmly wrung my hand.  I hastened after Peter the porter, who was wheeling my trunk down to the village inn where the coach stopped, and I had just time to mount on the top when the guard cried out, \"All right;\" the coachman laid his whip along the backs of the horses, which trotted gaily forward along the dusty road.  My spirits would naturally have risen at finding myself whirled along at the rate of ten miles an hour on my way homeward, but the last words spoken by the doctor continually recurred to me, and contributed greatly to damp them.  I managed, however, at length, to persuade myself that my anticipations of evil were mere fancies.  On reaching Liverpool, having called a porter to carry my things, I hurried homewards, expecting to receive the usual happy greetings from my father and sisters.  My spirits sank when looking up at the windows, I saw that all the blinds were drawn down.  I knocked at the door with trembling hand.  A strange and rough-looking man opened it.  \"Is my father at home?\"  I asked, in a low voice.  The man hesitated, looking hard at me, and then said, \"Yes; but you can't see him.  There are some ladies upstairs--your sisters, I suppose--you had better go to them.\"  There was an ominous silence in the house; no one was moving about. What had become of all the servants?  I stole gently up to Jane and Mary's boudoir.  They, and little Emily our younger sister, were seated together, all dressed in black.  Sobs burst from them, as they threw their arms round my neck, without uttering a word.  I then knew to a certainty what had happened--our kind father was dead; but I little conceived the sad misfortunes which had previously overtaken him and broken his heart, leaving his children utterly destitute.  Jane, on recovering herself, in a gentle sad voice told me all about it. \"Mary and I intend going out as governesses, but we scarcely know what to do for dear Emily and you Harry, though we will devote our salaries to keep you and her at school.\"  \"Oh, I surely can get a place as a nursemaid,\" said Emily, a fair delicate girl, looking but ill-adapted for the situation she proposed for herself.  \"And I, Jane, will certainly not deprive you and Mary of your hard-earned salaries, even were you to obtain what would be required,\" I answered, firmly.  \"I ought rather to support you, and I hope to be able to do so by some means or other.\"  My sisters even then were not aware of the sad position in which we were placed.  Our father had been a man of peculiarly reserved and retiring manners; he had formed no friendships in England, and the few people he knew were simply business acquaintances.  An execution had been put into the house even before his death, so that we had no power over a single article it contained.  The servants, with the exception of my sisters' black nurse, had gone away, and we had not a friend whose hospitality we could claim.  She, good creature (Mammy, as we called her), finding out, on seeing my trunk in the hall, that I had arrived, came breathless, from hurrying up stairs, into the room, and embracing me, kissed my forehead and cheeks as if I had still been a little child; and I felt the big drops fall from her eyes as she held me in her shrivelled arms.  \"Sad all this, Massa Harry, but we got good Fader up dere, and He take care of us though He call massa away,\" and she cast her eyes to heaven, trusting with a simple firm faith to receive from thence that protection she might have justly feared she was not likely to obtain on earth.  \"We all have our sorrows, dear children,\" she continued, \"massa had many sorrows when he lose your mother and his fortune, and I have my sorrows when I was carried away by slaver people, and leave my husband and piccaniny in Africa, and now your sorrows come.  But we can pray to the good God, and he lift us out of dem all.\"  Mammy had often told us of the cruel way in which she had been kidnapped, and how her husband had escaped with her little boy; and after she became a Christian (and a very sincere one she was), her great grief arose from supposing that her child would be brought up as a savage heathen in ignorance of the blessed truths of the gospel.  My sisters and I, as children, had often wept while she recounted her sad history, but at the time I speak of, I myself was little able to appreciate the deeper cause of her sorrow.  I thought, of course, that it was very natural she should grieve for the loss of her son, but I did not understand that it arose on account of her anxiety for his soul's salvation.  \"I pray day and night,\" I heard her once tell Jane, \"dat my piccaniny learn to know Christ, and I sure God hear my prayers.  How He bring it about I cannot tell.\"  We and Mammy followed our father to the grave, and were then compelled to quit the house, leaving everything behind us, with the exception of my sisters' wardrobes and a few ornaments, which they claimed as their property.  Mammy did her best to cheer us.  She had taken, unknown to my sisters, some humble, though clean, lodgings in the outskirts of the town, and to these she had carried whatever we were allowed to remove.  \"See, Massa Harry,\" she said, showing me an old leathern purse full of gold.  \"We no want food for long time to come, and before then God find us friends and show us what to do.\"  My sisters possessed various talents, and they at once determined to employ them to the best advantage.  Jane and Mary drew beautifully, and were adepts in all sorts of fancy needle-work.  Emily, though young, had written one or two pretty tales, and we were sure that she was destined to be an authoress.  Mammy, therefore, entreated them not to separate, assuring them that her only pleasure on earth would be to labour and assist in protecting them.  Had they had no other motive, for her sake alone, they would have been anxious to follow her advice.  I was the only one of the family who felt unable to do anything for myself.  I wrote too bad a hand to allow me any hopes of obtaining a situation in a counting-house; and though I would have gone out as an errand boy or page rather than be a burden to my sisters, I was sure they would not permit this, and, besides, I felt that by my taking an inferior position they would be lowered in the cold eyes of the world. I had ardently wished to go to sea, and I thought that the captain who had promised to take me as a midshipman would still receive me could I reach Portsmouth.  I did not calculate the expense of an outfit, nor did I think of the allowance young gentlemen are expected to receive on board a man-of-war.  I had wandered one day down to the docks to indulge myself in the sight of the shipping, contemplating the possibility of obtaining a berth on board one of the fine vessels I saw fitting out, and had been standing for some time on the quay, when I"]]]
