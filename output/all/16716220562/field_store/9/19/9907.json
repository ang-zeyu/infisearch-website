The work was commenced about midwinter of 1854- 5, and it was my privilege to do it.  When the hot weather came on at Jupiter, fever began to break out among the troops.  Jupiter Inlet had been closed for several years, and the water had become stagnant.  Within a very few weeks, every man, woman, and child was down, or had been down, with fever.  The mortality was such that there were hardly enough strong men remaining to bury the dead.  As soon as I had sufficiently recovered to go in a boat to Fort Capron, the major sent me back with all the convalescents that were fit to be moved, and soon afterward broke up that pest-house at Jupiter and moved the command back to Capron.  So far as I know, Fort Jupiter was never again occupied, and I think the block-house on Lake Okeechobee was never completed.  At all events, as good luck would have it, I got through with my part of the work and was ordered out of Florida before the Seminoles found out what the plans of the War Department were.  My old friend and companion George L. Hartsuff, who had like duty to perform on the west side of the lake, was attacked by the Indians and severely wounded, several of his men being killed.  He and a few others made their escape.  Hartsuff was one of the strongest, bravest, finest soldiers I ever knew, and one of my most intimate friends; but, unlike myself, he was always in bad luck.  He got caught by the Seminoles in Florida; was shipwrecked on Lake Michigan; came very near dying of yellow fever; and after organizing the Twenty-third Army Corps and commanding it for a time, finally died of the wounds he had received in Florida.  I had a new and peculiar experience at Fort Capron during my convalescence.  I had there twenty-five or thirty convalescent soldiers, and no doctor, but an intelligent hospital steward.  I was like the lawyer who was asked to say grace at the table of one of his wealthy clients, and who was unwilling to admit, under such circumstances, that there was any one thing he could not do.  So I had sick-call regularly every morning, carefully questioned every patient as to his symptoms, and told the steward what to give him, taking care not to prescribe anything which some doctor had not tried on me.  All my patients got well.  At length A. P. Hill came up from Jupiter, on his way home on sick-leave.  At Capron he had a relapse, and was desperately ill.  I had to send a barge to Jupiter for some medicine which he knew was necessary.  Mr. Jones, the sutler, and some of the men helped me to nurse him night and day for a long time.  At length he recovered so far as to continue his journey.  About the same time came orders promoting me to first lieutenant and detailing me for duty at West Point.  So Hill and I came out of Florida together.  On board the St. John's River steamer I had a relapse, and was very ill.  Hill cared for me tenderly, kept me at Savannah awhile, and then some days at Charleston, where I became so much better that he ventured to leave me long enough to go over to Fort Moultrie to see some of our brother officers.  While he was away I became so ill again that the doctor had to put me under the influence of chloroform.  When Hill came back in the evening he cursed himself for all that was mean in the world for having left me even for an hour.  That's the kind of friends and comrades soldiers are!  As soon as I was well enough to travel, Hill took me to his home at Culpeper Court-House in Virginia.  There they kept me quite a long time.  That dear old gentleman, his father, brought to my bedside every morning a brandy mint-julep, made with his own hand, to drink before I got up.  Under its benign influence my recovery was very rapid.  But let none of my young friends forget that the best gifts of Providence are those most liable to be abused.  The wise Virginian never offered me too many of them.  By the first of December Hill and I went together to West Point, I to report for duty, and he to visit his numerous warm friends at that delightful station.  There we parted, in December, 1855, never to meet again.  With the glad tidings from Virginia that peace was near, there came to me in North Carolina the report that Lieutenant- General A. P. Hill had been killed in the last battle at Petersburg. A keen pang shot through my heart, for he had not ceased to be esteemed as my kind friend and brother, though for four years numbered among the public enemy.  His sense of duty, so false in my judgment, I yet knew to be sincere, because I knew the man.  I wish all my fellow-citizens, North and South, East and West, could know each other as well as I knew A. P. Hill.                                IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY AT WEST POINT  I was assigned to duty in the department of philosophy, under Professor W. H. C. Bartlett, one of the ablest, most highly esteemed, and most beloved of the great men who have placed the United States Military Academy among the foremost institutions of the world.  At first it seemed a little strange to be called back, after the lapse of only two years, to an important duty at the place where my military record had been so \"bad.\"  But I soon found that at West Point, as elsewhere, the standard of merit depended somewhat upon the point of view of the judge.  A master of \"philosophy\" could not afford to look too closely into past records in other subjects. Besides, philosophers know, if others do not, that philosophers are sure to profit by healthful experience.  I never had any more trouble at West Point, though I did have much difficulty in helping younger men out.  I had the great good fortune never to be compelled to report a cadet for any delinquency, nor to find one deficient in studies, though I did sometimes have, figuratively speaking, to beat them over the head with a cudgel to get in \"phil\" enough to pass the academic board.  I had then a strong impression, which has grown still stronger with time, that \"equations A and B\" need not be developed very far into the \"mechanics of molecules\" to qualify a gallant young fellow for the command of a squadron of cavalry; but this is, in fact, generally and perfectly well understood at West Point.  The object there is to develop the mental, moral, and physical man to as high a degree as is practicable, and to ascertain his best place in the public service.  It is only the hopelessly incorrigible in some respect who fall by the way.  Even they, if they have stayed there long enough, are the better for the training they have received.  In this congenial work and its natural sequence I formed for the first time the habit of earnest, hard mental work to the limit of my capacity for endurance, and sometimes a little beyond, which I have retained the greater part of my life.  After the short time required to master the \"Analytical Mechanics\" which had been introduced as a text-book since I had graduated, and a short absence on account of my Florida debility, which had reduced me to 120 pounds in weight, I began to pursue physics into its more secret depths.  I even indulged the ambition to work out the mathematical interpretation of all the phenomena of physical science, including electricity and magnetism.  After three years of hard labor in this direction, I thought I could venture to publish a part of my work in book form, and thus submit it to the judgment of the able scientists whose acquaintance I had made at the meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.( 1)                                                        INTEREST IN ASTRONOMY  While I was engaged in this work upon physics, a young gentleman named Drown came to West Point, and asked me to give him some private lessons in mechanics and astronomy, to perfect his qualifications as a teacher.  I went over those subjects with him in about one hundred lessons, including a few in practical astronomy. He was the most ardent student I have ever known.  Like, I doubt not, all the most earnest seekers for divine truth, in whatever way revealed to man, he would not be satisfied with his own perception of such truth unless he could feel it \"burn in his brain.\"  In that brief experience I became for the first time intensely interested in practical astronomy, about which I had thought little before, although I had had sole charge of the observatory for some time. I have always since given Professor Drown credit for teaching me practical astronomy by first leading me to the discovery that I had a natural taste and aptitude for such work, theretofore unsuspected.  That new \"lead\" was followed with all possible zeal, day and night, for many months, until all the instruments in the observatory, fixed and movable, including the old mural circle, had gone through a season's work.  Although my scientific experience has been very limited, I do not believe anything else in the broad domain of science can be half so fascinating as the study of the heavens.  I have regretted many times that necessity limited my enjoyment of that great pleasure to a very few years instead of a lifetime.  In that West Point observatory I had one of the many opportunities of my life--one which I always enjoyed--of protecting the unfortunate from the stern decree of \"justice.\"  The old German custodian came to me one morning in great distress, saying that he had let the \"astronomical chronometer\" run down, and that the professor would kill him.  I went with him to the transit tower, made an observation, and set the chronometer.  The professor never knew the difference till I told him, after the lapse of time named in the military statute of limitations.  Then he seemed to rejoice as much as I over the narrow escape of his faithful subordinate.  The professor was not half as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21417"],["title","Forty-Six Years in the Army (#7)"],["body","as he sometimes appeared to be.  I need hardly say that in the midst of these absorbing occupations I forgot all about the career I had chosen in my boyhood.  The law had no longer any charms for me.  Yet I found in after life far more use for the law than for physics and astronomy, and little less than for the art and science of war.  In June, 1857, I married Miss Harriet Bartlett, the second daughter of my chief in the department of philosophy.  Five children were born to us, three of whom--two sons and one daughter--grew to maturity and survive their mother, who died in Washington soon after I was assigned to the command of the army, and was buried at West Point by the side of our first-born son, who had died in 1868, soon after I became Secretary of War.  In the summer of 1860 came the end of my term of duty at West Point. My taste for service in the line of the army, if I ever had any, was gone; and all hope of promotion, if I ever had any, was still further away.  I had been for more than four years about nineteenth first lieutenant in my regiment, without rising a single file.  I was a man of family, and had already become quite bald \"in the service of my country.\"  There was no captaincy in sight for me during the ordinary lifetime of man, so I accepted the professorship of physics in Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.  But Mr. Jefferson Davis, an intimate friend of my father-in-law, gave me a timely hint that promotion might be better in a year or two; and his bitterest personal enemy, General Scott, gave me a highly flattering indorsement which secured leave of absence for a year. Thus I retained my commission.                                PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY  As the period of the Civil War approached a very large part of my time was occupied in reading and studying, as coolly as possible, every phase of the momentous questions which I had been warned must probably be submitted to the decision of war.  Hence, when the crisis came I was not unprepared to decide for myself, without prejudice or passion, where the path of duty lay, yet not without some feeling of indulgence toward my brother officers of the army who, as I believed, were led by the influence of others so far astray.  I took an early occasion to inform General Scott of my readiness to relinquish my leave of absence and return to duty whenever my services might be required, and I had the high honor of not being requested to renew my oath of allegiance.  My life in St. Louis during the eight months next preceding the Civil War was of great benefit to me in the delicate and responsible duties which so soon devolved upon me.  My connection with Washington University brought me into close relations with many of the most patriotic, enlightened, and, above all, unselfish citizens of Missouri.  Some of them were of the Southern school of politics, but the large majority were earnest Union men, though holding the various shades of opinion then common on the question of slavery. By long and intimate intercourse, in the joint prosecution of the work of the highest philanthropy, such men had learned to respect the sincerity of each others's adverse convictions, and had become the exact exemplars of the many shades of honest, patriotic Unionism so clearly described in 1863 by President Lincoln in his letter to a delegation of partizans who had not learned that principle of charity which seems to have been born in the great martyr of freedom.  Would that I could do fitting honor to the names of those patriots, nearly all of whom have gone to their rest, including Dr. Elliot, President of Washington University.  James E. Yeatman, President of the Sanitary Commission, still lives to honor his country and the great cause of humanity of which he was the faithful and efficient servant.  I did not meet Hamilton R. Gamble until after he had become governor.  I shall have occasion to say more of him later.  He was the foremost champion of the Union cause in Missouri, and the most abused by those who were the loudest in their professions of loyalty.  Of the younger generation, I will mention only one, whose good deeds would otherwise never be known.  While himself absent in the public service, wherein he was most efficient, he made me occupy his delightful residence near Lafayette Park, and consume all the products of his excellent garden.  We knew each other then only as fellow-workers in the Union cause, but have been the most devoted friends from that day to this.  The name of that dear friend of mine is Charles Gibson.  Among the earliest and most active leaders in the Union cause in Missouri, I must not fail to mention the foremost--Frank P. Blair, Jr.  His patriotism and courage were like a calcium light at the head of the Union column in the dark days and nights of the spring of 1861.  [( 1) Much of my time in St. Louis during the winter preceding the Civil War was spent in revising this work, preparing illustrations, and getting it ready for the press.  Then it was packed up in a box and carefully stored away in the St. Louis Arsenal, to abide the results of war.]   CHAPTER III.

When it became probable that military force would be required by the government to maintain its authority in the Southern States, I informed the War Department of my readiness to return to duty whenever my services might be required, and was instructed to await orders in St. Louis.  Upon President Lincoln's first call for volunteers, I was detailed to muster in the troops required of the State of Missouri.  With the order of detail was furnished a copy of the old instructions for mustering into service, etc., which required me to call upon the governor of Missouri for the regiments to be mustered, and to accept only fully organized regiments.  It was well and publicly known that the executive of Missouri was disloyal to the United States, and that compliance with the President's demand for volunteers was not to be expected from the State government; yet my instructions authorized me to take no action which could be effective under such circumstances, and the then department commander, Brigadier-General William S. Harney, would not consent that any such action be taken without orders from Washington.  I called upon Governor Jackson for his regiments, but received no reply.                                                               RETURN TO DUTY  In my visit to General Harney after the attack on Fort Sumter, I urged the necessity of prompt measures to protect the St. Louis Arsenal, with its large stores of arms and ammunition, then of priceless value, and called his attention of a rumor of an intended attack upon the arsenal by the secessionists then encamped near the city under the guise of State militia.  In reply, the general denounced in his usual vigorous language the proposed attempt upon the arsenal; and, as if to clinch his characterization of such a \"---- outrage,\" said:  \"Why, the State has not yet passed an ordinance of secession; she has not gone out of the Union.\"  That did not indicate to me that General Harney's Union principles were quite up to the standard required by the situation, and I shared with many others a feeling of great relief when he was soon after relieved, and Captain Nathaniel Lyons succeeded to the command of the department.  Yet I have no doubt General Harney was, from his own point of view, thoroughly loyal to the Union, though much imbued with the Southern doctrines which brought on secession and civil war.  His appropriate place after that movement began was that of the honorable retirement in which he passed the remainder of his days, respected by all for his sterling character and many heroic services to his country.  Two days later, Captain Lyon, then commanding the St. Louis Arsenal, having received from the War Department authority to enroll and muster into the service the Missouri volunteers as they might present themselves, I reported to him and acted under his orders. Fortunately, a large number of the loyal citizens of St. Louis had, in anticipation of a call to take up arms in support of the government, organized themselves into companies, and received some instruction in tactics at their places of secret nightly meeting in the city.  On the other hand, the organized militia of the State, mostly disloyal, were in the city of St. Louis near the arsenal, which contained many thousand muskets, and which was defended by only a small body of regular troops.  There was great danger that the arsenal would follow the fate of the public arsenals in the more Southern States.  To avert this danger was the first great object.  Upon receipt of the necessary authority by Captain Lyon, I was called out of church on Sunday morning, April 21, and the loyal secret organizations were instructed to enter the arsenal at night, individually, each member being furnished with a pass for that purpose.  The mustering officer employed himself all night and the following day in distributing arms and ammunition to the men as they arrived, and in stationing them along the arsenal walls.  Thus the successful defense of the arsenal was secured, though its garrison was neither mustered into service nor organized into regiments, nor even enrolled.  The organization of the volunteers now began, the mustering officer superintending the election of officers, enrolling the men, and perfecting the organization in conformity to the militia laws of the State.  On June 4 I transmitted to the"]]]
