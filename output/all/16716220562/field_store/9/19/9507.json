By this peace war was suspended for ten years.  From my brief sketch of Mohammad's first six years' sojourn in Medina, it is evident that during this time Medina was constantly in a sort of military defence. The Moslems were every moment in the danger of an invasion, attack, or inroad from without, and treachery, conspiracy and treason from within. They either had to encounter superior numbers or to disperse hostile gathering or to chastise sometimes marauding tribes. So Mohammad could scarcely breathe freely at Medina, but much less could he find time and opportunity to mature a scheme of attacking the Koreish at Mecca in order to revenge himself and his refugees for the persecutions which the Koreish had inflicted on the Moslems, to redress their wrongs, and to re-establish their rights of civil and religious liberty, or to make converts of them or any other tribes at the point of sword.  [Footnote 11: Bani Ashja, Murra Fezárá, Suleim, Sád, Asad, and several clans of Ghatafán, the Jews of Wady-al-Koraa and Khyber.]  [Footnote 12: A party of Moslems at Zil Kassa was slain, and Dihya, sent by Mohammad to the Roman Emperor, on his return, was robbed of every thing by the Bani Juzám beyond Wady-al-Kora.]  [Footnote 13: The Jews at Khyber were enticing the Bani Fezárá and Bani Sad-bin-Bakr and other Bedouin tribes to make depredations upon Medina.]   [Sidenote: Armed opposition of the Koreish to the Moslem pilgrims in the vicinity of Mecca.]  [Sidenote: Mohammad proclaimed war against the opposing Koreish to obtain the right of civil and religious liberty at Mecca.]  10. It was only when the Moslems, unarmed as they were in pilgrim's garb, were opposed by the armed Koreish, who had encamped at Zú Towa, clothed in panther's skin, or, in other words, with a firm resolution to fight to the last, and when Osman, the Moslem envoy to Mecca, was actually placed in confinement,[14] of whom the rumour was constantly rife that he was murdered at Mecca, and when a party of the Koreish had actually attacked the camp of Mohammad,[15] that excitement, alarm and anxiety prevailed in the Moslem camp, and Mohammad took a solemn oath from the Faithful to stand by their cause even unto death. (Sura XLVIII.[16]) In the meantime appeals were received from the Moslems detained in confinement at Mecca, and otherwise oppressed for deliverance. _Vide_ Sura IV, verses 77, 99, 100; Sura VIII, verses 72, 73. He, on this occasion, proclaimed a war with the Koreish in the event of their attacking first, and enjoining the believers to redress their earlier and later wrongs, to establish their civil and religious liberty, to have free access to their native city, to have the free exercise of their religion, and to make away with the oppressions of Koreish once for all.  The following verses were published on the occasion:--Sura II, verses 186-190, 212-215. The Sura XLVIII afterwards had reference to the occasion, specially verses 10, 22-27. They are quoted in pp. 17-19.  [Sidenote: The war thus proclaimed did not take place.]  But happily a truce was agreed upon, and not a drop of blood was shed on either side. Thus the injunctions contained in the verses referred to above were never carried out. Mohammad, in proclaiming this war, had all the laws and justice on his side. Even this war, had it been waged, would have been defensive, undertaken for the purpose of establishing the civil rights of the Moslems and their religious liberty, hitherto unjustly denied them.  [Footnote 14: Ibn Hisham, p. 746.]  [Footnote 15: _Ibid._ 745, see Sura XLVIII.]  [Footnote 16: Mohammad had gained over some of the Bedouin tribes in the direction of Mecca, and were on friendly terms with him. At this time they were summoned by Mohammad to join him if there be a war. They did not join him except a very few.]   [Sidenote: The Koreish again commit hostilities and violate their pledges.]  [Sidenote: War declared against those who had violated the truce.]  11. This truce did not last long. The last act of hostility on the part of the aggressive Koreish was the violation of the truce within two years of its being concluded. This resulted in the submission of Mecca. The tribe of Bani Khozáa,[17] who were now converts to Islam since the truce, and who had entered into an open alliance with Mohammad at the treaty, were attacked by the Koreish and their allies, the Bani Bakr.[18] The aggressed Moslems appealed for aid to Mohammad through a deputation, that displayed their wrongs to Mohammad and his followers in very touching terms, urging in a plaintive tone to avenge them upon the treacherous murderers. War was declared by Mohammad against the aggressors, who had violated the truce, and attacked the Bani Khozáa, to redress their wrongs. A proclamation was issued declaring immunity from God and his Apostle to those who had broken the league and aided the Bani Bakr against the Khozáa. Four months' time was allowed them to make terms, in default of which they were to be warred against, seized, and besieged, in short, to suffer all the hardships of war. Sura IX, verses 1-15, was published declaring the war. It has been copied at pages 22-25 of the book.  [Sidenote: War not carried out.]  But the threatened war did not actually take place, and Mecca surrendered by a compromise. Thus Mohammad obtained his object of civil and religious liberty of the Moslems at Mecca and Medina, and averted the (_fitnah_) persecutions and oppressions of the Koreish without actual war or bloodshed, and also secured peace for his followers in exchange of the constant fear and agitation impending over them. This was promised some years ago in Sura XXIV, verse 54, which runs as follows:--       \"God hath promised to those of you who believe and do the things      that are right, that He will cause them to succeed other in the      land, as He gave succession to those who went before them, and that      He will establish for them their religion in which they delight,      and that after their fears He will give them security in exchange.      They shall worship Me: nought shall they join with Me: And whoso      after this believe not, they will be the impious.\"  [Footnote 17: The Bani Khozáa are also taken notice of in Sura VIII, verses 73-74.]  [Footnote 18: The Bani Bakr, son of Abd Monát, were a branch of Kinána of the Moaddite stock.]   [Sidenote: War with foes other than the Koreish.]  12. Now I shall dispense with the Koreish and refer to the wars of other enemies of the early Moslems. There is only one war of the Arab tribes other than the Koreish noticed in the Koran, and that is the battle of Honain. In this war the Sakifites were the aggressors. The battle of Muraisia is not noticed in the Koran, but it is stated by biographers that information of a new project against him after the defeat at Ohad in the direction of Mecca, and the Bani Mustalik's raising fresh forces with a view of joining the Koreish in the threatened attack of Medina having reached Mohammad, he resolved by a bold attempt to prevent their design. I have shown in the book that the expedition of Mohammad against Khyber was purely in self-defence. A war undertaken to protect ourselves from the impending danger of an attack from the enemy and with the purpose of checking its advance, is a defensive war under the Law. I am not going to treat of expedition of the Bani Koreizá separately, but this much is necessary to say here, that they had treacherously defected from the Moslem with whom they had entered into a defensive alliance, and had joined the confederate army against the Moslems. For a detail account of them, the reader is referred to pages 87-91 of this book.   [Sidenote: Expedition to Tabúk to check the advancing enemy. No war took place.]  13. The expedition of Mecca, already described, ended in a submission and compromise without any resort to arms; that against Tabúk was undertaken, as it is admitted by all writers, Moslem and European, for purely defensive purposes. Mohammad was much alarmed on this occasion owing to the threatening news of a foreign invasion against the Moslem commonwealth. The following verses of the Ninth Sura are most probably directed towards the Romans and their Jewish and Christian allies,[19] if not towards the Jews of Khyber:--       29. \"Make war upon such of those to whom the Scriptures have been      given as believe not in God or in the last day, and who forbid not      that which God and His Apostle have forbidden, and who profess not      the profession of the Truth, until they pay tribute out of hand,      and they be humbled.\"       124. \"Believers wage war against such of the unbelievers as are      your neighbours, and let them assuredly find rigour in you, and      know that God is with those who fear him.\"--_Sura IX._  Mohammad returned without any war, and there was no occasion to carry out the injunctions contained in these verses.  Mohammad had taken great pains, according to the severity of the impending danger, to induce the Moslems to go to war in their own defence. But as the season was hot, and the journey a long one, some of them were very backward in doing so.  There is a very violent denunciation against those who on various false pretences held back on the occasion.  [Footnote 19: The Jews of Macna Azrúh and Jabra, and the Christian Chiefs of Ayla and Dúma.]   [Sidenote: Number of the wars of Mohammad.]  14. The above sketch of the hostilities will show that there were only five battles in which actual fighting took place. The biographers of Mohammad and the narrators of his campaigns are too lax in enumerating the expeditions led by Mohammad. They have noted down the names and accounts of various expeditions without having due regard to a rational criticism, or without being bound by the stringent laws of the technical"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20927"],["title","A Critical Exposition of the Popular 'Jihád' (#6)"],["body","of traditionary evidence. Consequently, they give us romances of the expeditions without specifying which of them are true and which fictitious. There are many expeditions enumerated by the biographers[20] which have, in fact, no trustworthy evidence for their support; some are altogether without foundation, and some of them are wrongly termed as expeditions for warring purposes. _Ghazávát_ is wrongly understood by European writers as meaning \"plundering expeditions.\" Deputations to conclude friendly treaties, missions to teach Islam, embassies to foreign chiefs, mercantile expeditions, pilgrims' processions, parties sent to disperse or chastise a band of robbers, or to watch the movements of an enemy, spies sent to bring information, and forces dispatched or led to fight with or check an enemy are all called \"_Ghazavát_\" (expeditions,) \"_Saráya_\" and \"_Baús_\" (enterprises and despatches). Thus the number of Mohammad's expeditions has been unduly exaggerated, first by biographers, who noted down every expedition or warlike enterprise reported in the several authentic and unauthentic traditions long after their occurrences, and did not at all trouble their heads by criticising them; and secondly by giving all missions, deputations, embassies, pilgrims' journies, and mercantile enterprises under the category of \"_Ghazavát_\" and \"_Saráya_,\" lately construed by European writers as \"plundering expeditions,\" or \"a despatch of body of men with hostile intents.\" The biographers, both Arabian and European, have gone so far as to assert that there were 27 expeditions led by Mohammad in person, and 74 others headed by persons nominated by himself, making in all 101. This number is given by Ibn Sád Kátib Wákidi (vide _Kustaláni_, Vol. VI, page 386). Ibn Is-hak also gives the number of Mohammad's expeditions to be 27, while others led at his order are put down at 38 only (vide _Ibn Hishám_, pp. 972 and 973). Abú Yola has a tradition from Jabir, a contemporary of Mohammad, who mentions only 21 expeditions. But the best authority, Zeid-bin-Arqam, in the earliest traditions collected by Bokhári, _Kitábul Maghazi_, in two places in his book, reduces the number to 19, including all sorts of expeditions and the number in which he was with Mohammad. Out of these alleged 27, 21, 19 and 17 expeditions, there were only 8[21] or 9,[22] in which an actual fighting took place. Even the latter minimized numbers are not deserving of confidence. The actual expeditions are as follow:--       1. Badr.      2. Ohad.      *  Muraisi.      3. Ahazáb.      *  Koreiza.      4. Khyber.      *  Mecca.      5. Honain.      *  Táyif.  There are no good authorities for the war at Muraisi with the Bani Mustalik. There were no fightings with the Koreiza, as their affair was but a continuation of the war of Ahzab, and therefore does not require a separate number. At Mecca there was no action, and it surrendered by a compromise. As for Táyif it was a part of the battle of Honain like Autás. It was besieged to lay hold of the fugitives who had sought there a shelter, and subsequently the siege was raised. Thus, there remain only five expeditions, which I have numbered out of nine, in which Mohammad fought against his enemies in his and his followers' defence. Even these five scarcely deserve the name of battle. From a military point of view, they were but petty skirmishes in their results. The enemy's loss at Badr was 49, at Ohad 20, at Ahzáb 3, at Khyber 93, and at Honain 93; but the last two numbers are open to doubt, and seem to be exaggerated. The loss on the Moslem side was 14, 74, 5, 19, and 17 respectively. The whole casualties in these wars on the side of the Moslems were 129, and on that of the enemies 258, which is exactly double those of the Moslems, and looks suspicious; hence it must be accepted with caution.  [Footnote 20: The biographers have only compiled or arranged the mass of popular romances and favourite tales of campaigns, which had become stereotyped in their time, but were for the most part the inventions of a playful fantasy.]  [Footnote 21: Musa-bin-Akba (died 141 A.H.)]  [Footnote 22: Ibn Sád and Ibn Is-hak as already alluded to.]   [Sidenote: Mr. Green quoted.]  15. The Rev. Samuel Green writes:--       \"It has been insinuated that Mahomet first took up arms in his own      defence, and by more than one historian he has been justified in      seeking to repel or prevent the hostilities of his enemies, and to      exact a reasonable measure of retaliation. 'The choice of an      independent people,' says Gibbon, 'had exalted the fugitive of      Mecca to the rank of a sovereign, and he was invested with the just      prerogative of forming alliances, and of waging offensive or      defensive war.'[23] That such a sentiment was entertained by a      Mahometan does not at all surprise us, nor is it marvellous that it      should be justified by an infidel; if it be true, war needs nothing      to render laudable but the pretext of former injuries and the      possession of power. The defence set up for Mahomet is equally      availing for every sanguinary and revengeful tyrant; and men,      instead of being bound together by the ties of clemency and mutual      forgiveness of injuries, are transformed into fiends, watching for      the opportunity of destroying each other.\"[24]  There was no pretence of former injuries on the part of the Moslems to make war on the Koreish. They were actually attacked by the Koreish and were several times threatened with inroads by them and their allies. So it was not until they were attacked by the enemy that they took up arms in their own defence, and sought to repel and prevent hostilities of their enemies. The defence set up for Mohammad is not equally availing of every sanguinary and revengeful tyrant. It was not only that Mohammad was wronged or attacked, but all the Moslems suffered injuries and outrages at Mecca, and when expelled therefrom, they were attacked upon, were not allowed to return to their homes, and to perform the pilgrimage there. The social and religious liberty, a natural right of every individual and nation, was denied them. A cruel or revengeful tyrant may not be justified in taking up arms in his own defence, or in seeking to redress his personal wrongs and private injuries; but the whole Moslem community at Mecca was outraged, persecuted and expelled,--and the entire Mohammadan commonwealth at Medina was attacked, injured and wronged,--their natural rights and privileges were disregarded--after such miseries the Moslems took up arms to protect themselves from the hostilities of their enemies and to repel force by force; and were justified by every law and justice.  The right of self-defence is a part of the law of nature, and it is the indispensable duty of civil society to protect its members. Even if a sanguinary and revengeful tyrant were to do so in his own behalf, he would be quite justified in this particular act. A just war, that is one undertaken for just causes to repel or revert wrongful force, or to establish a right, cannot be impeached on any ground, religious, moral, or political. But the Moslems had tried every possible means of obtaining a pacific solution of the difficulty which had arisen between them and their enemies, the Koreish and the Jews, to avert war and its horrors. Mohammad had repeatedly informed the Koreish that if they desist they will be forgiven.       88. \"But if they desist, then verily God is gracious, merciful.\"       189. \"But if they desist, then let there be no hostility, save      against wrong-doers.\"--_Sura II._       19. \"_O Meccans!_ if ye desired a decision, now hath the decision      come to you. It will be better for you to give over _the struggle_.      If ye return _to it_, we will return; and your forces, though they      be many, shall by no means avail you aught, because God is with the      faithful.\"       39. \"Say to the infidels: If they desist what is now past shall be      forgiven them; but if they turn _to it_, they have already before      them the doom of the former.\"--_Sura VIII._  And the same was the case regarding the Jews.       104. \"Many of those who have Scripture would like to bring you back      to unbelief after you have believed, out of selfish envy, even      after the truth hath been shown to them. Forgive them then, and      shun them till God shall come with his decree. Truly God hath power      over all things.\"--_Sura II._       63. \"But if they lean to peace, lean thou also to it; and put thy      trust in God. He verily is the hearing, the knowing.\"--_Sura VIII._       16. ... \"Thou wilt not cease to discover the treacherous ones among      them, except a few of them. But forgive them and pass it over.      Verily God loveth those who act generously.\"--_Sura V._  But there could be no peace or mutual agreement on the part of the enemy until the truce of Hodeibia, which was also violated by them in a short time.  Even in the wars which were waged for self-preservation, the Prophet had very much mitigated the evils which are necessarily inflicted in the progress of wars. Fraud, perfidy, cruelty, killing women, children and aged persons were forbidden by Mohammad;[25] and a kind treatment of the prisoners of war enjoined. But foremost of these all--slavery, and domestication of concubinary slaves, the concomitant evils of war--were abolished by him, ordering at the same time that prisoners of war should be either liberated gratis or ransomed. Neither they were to be enslaved nor killed. (_Vide_ Sura XLVII, verses 4 and 5; and Appendix B of this work.) Attacking offensively was forbidden by the Koran (II, 186 _La Taatadú_, _i.e._ 'Do not attack first'). Mohammad had taken oaths from the Moslems to refrain from plundering (_vide_ page 58 of this book).       \"All hostilities and plundering excursions between neighbouring      tribes that had become Musalman he forbade on pain of death;"]]]
