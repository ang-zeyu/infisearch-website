S. M._     A THANKSGIVING.     Lord, I confess too, when I dine,                 The pulse is Thine,   And all those other bits that be                 There placed by Thee;   The worts, the purslane, and the mess                 Of water-cress,   Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent;                 And my content   Makes those and my belovéd beet                 To be more sweet.   'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth                 With guiltless mirth,   And giv'st me wassail-bowls to drink                 Spiced to the brink.                      _Robert Herrick._     AROUND THE WASSAIL-BOWL.     A jolly wassail-bowl,     A wassail of good ale;   Well fare the butler's soul     That setteth this to sale;                   Our jolly wassail.    Good dame, here at your door     Our wassail we begin,   We are all maidens poor,     We pray now let us in                   With our wassail.    Our wassail we do fill     With apples and with spice,   Then grant us your good-will     To taste here once or twice                   Of our good wassail.    If any maidens be     Here dwelling in this house,   They kindly will agree     To take a full carouse                   Of our wassail.    But here they let us stand     All freezing in the cold:   Good master, give command     To enter and be bold,                   With our wassail.    Much joy into this hall     With us is entered in,   Our master first of all     We hope will now begin                   Of our wassail.    And after, his good wife     Our spicéd bowl will try;   The Lord prolong your life!     Good fortune we espy                   For our wassail.    Some bounty from your hands     Our wassail to maintain;   We'll buy no house nor lands     With that which we do gain                   With our wassail.    This is our merry night     Of choosing king and queen;   Then be it your delight     That something may be seen                   In our wassail.    It is a noble part     To bear a liberal mind;   God bless our master's heart!     For here we comfort find                   With our wassail.    And now we must be gone     To seek out more good cheer,   Where bounty will be shown     As we have found it here                   With our wassail.    Much joy betide them all,     Our prayer shall be still,   We hope and ever shall     For this your great good-will                   To our wassail.     FROM DOOR TO DOOR.     Here we come a wassailing   Among the leaves so green,   Here we come a wand'ring,   So fair to be seen.   Love and joy come to you,   And to you your wassail too,   And God bless you and send you a happy New Year.    Our wassail-cup is made   Of the rosemary tree,   And so is your beer   Of the best barley.                         Love and joy, etc.    We are not daily beggars   That beg from door to door,   But we are neighbors' children   Whom you have seen before.                         Love and joy, etc.    Good master and good mistress,   As you sit by the fire,   Pray think of us poor children   As wand'ring in the mire.                         Love and joy, etc.    We have a little purse   Made of ratching leather skin;   We want some of your small change   To line it well within.                         Love and joy, etc.    Call up the butler of this house,   Put on his golden ring;   Let him bring us a glass of beer,   And the better we shall sing.                         Love and joy, etc.    Bring us out a table,   And spread it with a cloth;   Bring us out a mouldy cheese,   And some of your Christmas loaf.                         Love and joy, etc.    God bless the master of this house,   Likewise the mistress too   And all the little children   That round the table go.                         Love and joy, etc.     WASSAILING CAROL.     We wish you merry Christmas, also a glad New Year;   We come to bring you tidings to all mankind so dear:   We come to tell that Jesus was born in Bethl'em town,   And now He's gone to glory and pityingly looks down               On us poor wassailers,               As wassailing we go;               With footsteps sore               From door to door         We trudge through sleet and snow.    A manger was His cradle, the straw it was His bed,   The oxen were around Him within that lowly shed;   No servants waited on Him with lords and ladies gay;   But now He's gone to glory and unto Him we pray.                       Us poor wassailers, etc.    His mother loved and tended Him and nursed Him at her breast,   And good old Joseph watched them both the while they took their rest;   And wicked Herod vainly sought to rob them of their child,   By slaughtering the Innocents in Bethlehem undefiled.                       But us poor wassailers, etc.    Now, all good Christian people, with great concern we sing   These tidings of your Jesus, the Saviour, Lord and King;   In poverty He passed His days that riches we might share,   And of your wealth He bids you give and of your portion spare                       To us poor wassailers, etc.    Your wife shall be a fruitful vine, a hus'sif good and able;   Your children like the olive branches round about your table;   Your barns shall burst with plenty and your crops shall be secure,   If you will give your charity to us who are so poor,                       Us poor wassailers, etc.    And now no more we'll sing to you because the hour is late,   And we must trudge and sing our song at many another gate;   And so we'll wish you once again a merry Christmas time,   And pray God bless you while you give good silver for our rhyme.                       Us poor wassailers, etc.     A CAROL AT THE GATES.     Here we come a-whistling through the fields so green;   Here we come a-singing, so fair to be seen.     God send you happy, God send you happy,     Pray God send you a happy New Year!    The roads are very dirty, my boots are very thin,   I have a little pocket to put a penny in.                       God send you happy, etc.    Bring out your little table and spread it with a cloth,   Bring out some of your old ale, likewise your Christmas loaf.                       God send you happy, etc.    God bless the master of this house, likewise the mistress, too,   And all the little children that round the table strew.                       God send you happy, etc.    The cock sat up in the yew-tree, the hen came chuckling by,   I wish you a merry Christmas, and a good fat pig in the sty.                       God send you happy, etc.     WANDERING WASSAILERS.     Wassail, wassail, all over the town,   Our bread it is white, and our ale it is brown;   Our bowl it is made of the maplin tree,   So here, my good fellow, I'll drink it to thee.    The wassailing bowl, with a toast within,   Come, fill it up unto the brim;   Come fill it up that we may all see;   With the wassailing bowl I'll drink to thee.    Come, butler, come bring us a bowl of your best,   And we hope your soul in heaven shall rest;   But if you do bring us a bowl of your small,   Then down shall go butler, the bowl, and all.    O butler, O butler, now don't you be worst,   But pull out your knife and cut us a toast;   And cut us a toast, one that we may all see;   With the wassailing bowl I'll drink to thee.    Here's to Dobbin and to his right eye!   God send our mistress a good Christmas-pie!   A good Christmas-pie as e'er we did see;   With the wassailing bowl I'll drink to thee.    Here's to Broad May and his broad horn,   God send our master a good crop of corn,   A good crop of corn as we all may see;   With the wassailing bowl I'll drink to thee.    Here's to Colly and to her long tail,   We hope our master and mistress heart will ne'er fail;   But bring us a bowl of your good strong beer,   And then we shall taste of your happy New Year.    Be there here any pretty maids? we hope there be some;   Don't let the jolly wassailers stand on the cold stone,   But open the door and pull out the pin,   That we jolly wassailers may all sail in.                      _Chappell's Ancient English Melodies._     BRING US IN GOOD ALE.     _Bring us in good ale, and bring us in good ale;_   _For our blessed Lady's sake, bring us in good ale._    Bring us in no brown bread, for that is made of bran,   Nor bring us in no white bread, for therein is no game,                     But bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no beef, for there are many bones,   But bring us in good ale, for that goeth down at once;                     And bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no bacon, for that is passing fat,   But bring us in good ale, and give us enough of that;                     And bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no mutton, for that is often lean,   Nor bring us in no tripes, for they be seldom clean;                     But bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no eggs, for there are many shells,   But bring us in good ale, and give us nothing else;                     And bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no butter, for therein are many hairs,   Nor bring us in no pig's flesh, for that will make us boars;                     But bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no puddings, for therein is all God's good,   Nor bring us in no venison, for that is not for our blood;                     But bring us in good ale.    Bring us in no capon's flesh, for that is often dear,   Nor bring us in no duck's flesh, for they slobber in the mere;                     But bring us in good ale.                      _Wright's Songs and Carols._     ABOUT THE BOARD.     Come bravely on, my masters,   For here we shall be tasters     Of curious dishes that are brave and fine,   Where they that do such cheer afford,   I'll lay my knife upon the board,     My master and my dame they do not pine.    Who is't will not be merry   And sing down, down, aderry?     For now it is a time "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20956"],["title","In The Yule-Log Glow, Book IV (#8)"],["body","joy and mirth;   'Tis said 'tis merry in the hall   When as beards they do wag all;     God's plenty's here, it doth not show a dearth.    Let him take all lives longest,   Come fill us of the strongest,     And I will drink a health to honest John;   Come, pray thee, butler, fill the bowl,   And let it round the table troll,     When that is up, I'll tell you more anon.                      _New Christmas Carols, A.D. 1642._     BEFORE THE FEAST.     All you that are good fellows,     Come hearken to my song;   I know you do not hate good cheer     Nor liquor that is strong.   I hope there is none here     But soon will take my part,   Seeing my master and my dame     Say welcome with their heart.    This is a time of joyfulness     And merry time of year,   Whereas the rich with plenty stored     Doth make the poor good cheer;   Plum-porridge, roast-beef, and minced-pies     Stand smoking on the board,   With other brave varieties     Our master doth afford.    Our mistress and her cleanly maids     Have neatly played the cooks;   Methinks these dishes eagerly     At my sharp stomach looks,   As though they were afraid     To see me draw my blade;   But I revenged on them will be     Until my stomach's stayed.    Come fill us of the strongest,     Small drink is out of date;   Methinks I shall fare like a prince     And sit in gallant state:   This is no miser's feast,     Although that things be dear;   God grant the founder of this feast     Each Christmas keep good cheer.    This day for Christ we celebrate,     Who was born at this time;   For which all Christians should rejoice,     And I do sing in rhyme.   When you have given God thanks,     Unto your dainties fall:   Heaven bless my master and my dame,     Lord bless me and you all.                      _New Christmas Carols, A.D. 1642._     A BILL OF CHRISTMAS FARE.     Come, mad boys, be glad, boys, for Christmas is here,   And we shall be feasted with jolly good cheer;   Then let us be merry, 'tis Saint Stephen's day,   Let's eat and drink freely, here's nothing to pay.    My master bids welcome, and so doth my dame,   And 'tis yonder smoking dish doth me inflame;   Anon I'll be with you, though you me outface,   For now I do tell you I have time and place.    I'll troll the bowl to you, then let it go round,   My heels are so light they can stand on no ground;   My tongue it doth chatter, and goes pitter patter,   Here's good beer and strong beer, for I will not flatter.    And now for remembrance of blessed Saint Stephen,   Let's joy at morning, at noon, and at even;   Then leave off your mincing, and fall to mince-pies,   I pray take my counsel, be ruled by the wise.                      _New Christmas Carols, A.D. 1642._     THE MAHOGANY-TREE.     Christmas is here:   Winds whistle shrill,   Icy and chill,   Little care we:   Little we fear   Weather without   Sheltered about   The Mahogany-Tree.    Once on the boughs   Birds of rare plume   Sang, in its bloom;   Night-birds are we:   Here we carouse,   Singing like them,   Perched round the stem   Of the jolly old tree.    Here let us sport,   Boys, as we sit;   Laughter and wit   Flashing so free,   Life is but short--   When we are gone,   Let them sing on   Round the old tree.    Evenings we knew,   Happy as this;   Faces we miss,   Pleasant to see,   Kind hearts and true,   Gentle and just,   Peace to your dust,   We sing round the tree.    Care, like a dun,   Lurks at the gate:   Let the dog wait;   Happy we'll be!   Drink, every one;   Pile up the coals,   Fill the red bowls,   Round the old tree!    Drain we the cup--   Friend, art afraid?   Spirits are laid   In the Red Sea.   Mantle it up;   Empty it yet;   Let us forget,   Round the old tree.    Sorrow, begone!   Life and its ills,   Duns and their bills,   Bid we to flee.   Come with the dawn,   Blue-devil sprite,   Leave us to-night   Round the old tree.                      _William Makepeace Thackeray._     A CHRISTMAS CEREMONY.     Wassail the trees, that they may bear   You many a plum and many a pear;   For more or less fruits they will bring   As you do give them wassailing.                      _Robert Herrick._     WITH CAKES AND ALE.     With cakes and ale, and antic ring   Well tiptoed to the tabor string,     And many a buss below the holly,     And flout at sable melancholy--   So, with a rouse, went Christmassing!    What! are no latter waits to sing?   No clog to blaze? No wit to wing?     Are catches gone, and dimpled Dolly,                         With cakes and ale?    Nay, an you will, behold the thing:   The spicéd meat, the minstreling!     Undo Misrule, and many a volley     Of losel snatches born of folly--   Bring back the cheer, be Christmas-king,                         With cakes and ale!                      _H. S. M._     THE MASQUE OF CHRISTMAS.  (AS IT WAS PRESENTED AT COURT, 1616.)                   _The Court being seated_,  _Enter_ CHRISTMAS, _with two or three of the guard, attired in round   hose, long stockings, a close doublet, a high-crowned hat, with a   brooch, a long, thin beard, a truncheon, little ruffs, white shoes,   his scarfs and garters tied cross, and his drum beaten before him._  Why, gentlemen, do you know what you do? ha! would you have kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas, Christmas of London, and Captain Christmas? Pray you, let me be brought before my lord chamberlain, I'll not be answered else: _'Tis merry in hall, when beards wag all:_ I have seen the time you have wish'd for me for a merry Christmas; and now you have me, they would not let me in: _I must come another time!_ a good jest, as if I could come more than once a year! Why, I am no dangerous person, and so I told my friends of the guard. I am old Gregory Christmas still, and though I come out of Pope's-head alley, as good a Protestant as any in my parish. The truth is, I have brought a Masque here, out o' the city, of my own making, and do present it by a set of my sons, that come out of the lanes of London, good dancing boys all. It was intended, I confess, for Curriers Hall; but because the weather has been open, and the Livery were not at leisure to see it till a frost came, that they cannot work, I thought it convenient, with some little alterations, and the groom of the revels' hand to 't, to fit it for a higher place; which I have done, and though I say it, another manner of device than your New-Year's-night. Bones o' bread, the king! (_seeing King James._) Son Rowland! Son Clem! be ready there in a trice: quick, boys!   _Enter his Sons and Daughters, (ten in number,) led in, in a string,   by Cupid, who is attired in a flat cap, and a prentice's coat, with   wings at his shoulders._  MISRULE, _in a velvet cap, with a sprig, a short cloak, great yellow   ruff, like a reveller, his torch-bearer bearing a rope, a cheese,   and a basket._  CAROL, _a long tawny coat, with a red cap, and a flute at his   girdle, his torch-bearer carrying a song-book open._  MINCED-PIE, _like a fine cook's wife, drest neat; her man carrying a   pie, dish, and spoons._  GAMBOL, _like a tumbler, with a hoop and bells; his torch-bearer   armed with a colt-staff, and a binding cloth._  POST AND PAIR, _with a pair-royal of aces in his hat; his garment   all done over with pairs and purs; his squire carrying a box, cards,   and counters._  NEW-YEAR'S-GIFT, _in a blue coat, serving-man like, with an orange,   and a sprig of rosemary gilt on his head, his hat full of brooches,   with a collar of ginger-bread, his torch-bearer carrying a   march-pane with a bottle of wine on either arm._  MUMMING, _in a masquing pied suit, with a vizard, his torch-bearer   carrying the box, and ringing it._  WASSEL, _like a neat sempster and songster; her page bearing a brown   bowl, drest with ribands, and rosemary before her._  OFFERING, _in a short gown, with a porter's staff in his hand, a   wyth born before him, and a bason, by his torch-bearer._  BABY-CAKE, _drest like a boy, in a fine long coat, biggin-bib,   muckender, and a little dagger; his usher bearing a great cake, with   a bean and a pease._                  _They enter singing._    Now God preserve, as you do well deserve,     Your majesties all, two there;   Your highness small, with my good lords all,     And ladies, how do you do there?    Give me leave to ask, for I bring you a masque     From little, little, little London;   Which say the king likes, I have passed the pikes,     If not, old Christmas is undone.                                     [_Noise without._  _Chris._ Ho, peace! what's the matter there?  _Gam._ Here's one o' Friday-street would come in.  _Chris._ By no means, nor out of neither of the Fish-streets, admit not a man; they are not Christmas creatures: fish and fasting days, foh! Sons, said I well? look to it.  _Gam._ No body out o' Friday-street, nor the two Fish-streets there, do you hear?  _Car._ Shall John Butter o' Milk-street come in? Ask him.  _Gam._ Yes, he may slip in for a torch-bearer, so he melt not too fast, that he will last till the masque be done.  _Chris._ Right, son.    Our dance's freight is a matter of eight;     And two, the which are wenches:   In all they be ten, four cocks to a hen,     And will swim to the tune like tenches.    Each hath his knight for to carry his light,     Which some would say are torches   To bring them here, and to lead them there,     And home again to their own porches.    Now their intent,--                  _Enter_ VENUS, _a deaf tire-woman._  _Ven._ Now, all the lords bless me! where am I, trow? where is Cupid? \"Serve the king!\" they may serve the cobbler well enough, some of 'em, for any courtesy they have, I wisse; they have need o' mending: unrude people they are, your courtiers; here was thrust upon thrust indeed: was it ever so hard to get in before, trow?  _Chris._ How now? what's the matter?  _Ven._ A place, forsooth, I do want a place: I would have a good place, to see my child act in before the king"]]]
