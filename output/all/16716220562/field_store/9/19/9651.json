Whether each one felt equally sure that he himself would have filled the post better is a question it is not necessary to ask here.  The doctor was brief and to the point.  \"I dare say you know why I have called you together,\" he said. \"Wyndham--whom every one here liked and respected, and who did a great deal for the school\"--(\"Hear, hear,\" from one or two voices)--\"has left, and we shall all miss him.  The captain of the school has always for a long time past been the head classical boy.  It is not a law of the Medes and Persians that it should be so, and if there seemed any special reason why the rule should be broken through there is nothing to prevent that being done.\"  At this point one or two breathed rather more freely and the attention generally was intensified.  After all, this seemed like the preface to a more favourable announcement.  But those who thought so found their mistake when the doctor proceeded.  \"In the present case there is no such reason, and Riddell here is fully aware of the duties expected of him, and is prepared to perform them.  I look to you to support him, and am confident if all work heartily together no one need be afraid for the continued success of Willoughby.\"  The doctor ended his speech amid the silence of his audience, which was not broken as he turned and left the room.  At the same moment, to the relief of no one more than of Riddell, the bell sounded for breakfast and the assembly forthwith broke up.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE NEW CAPTAIN IS DISCUSSED ON LAND AND WATER.  The doctor's announcement was not long in taking effect.  As soon as third school was over that afternoon the monitors assembled in the Sixth Form room to discuss the situation.  Fortunately for Riddell's peace of mind, he was not present; but nearly all the others, whether friendly or otherwise, were there.  Game, with his usual downrightness, opened the ball.  \"Well, you fellows,\" said he, \"what are you going to do?\"  \"Let's have a game of leapfrog while the fags aren't looking,\" said Crossfield, a schoolhouse monitor and a wag in a small way.  \"It's all very well for you to fool about,\" said Game, ill-temperedly. \"You schoolhouse fellows think, as long as you get well looked after, Willoughby may go to the dogs.\"  \"What do you mean?\" said Fairbairn.  \"I don't think so.\"  \"I suppose you'd like to make out that Riddell is made captain because he's the best man for the place, and not because the doctor always favours the schoolhouse,\" snarled Wibberly.  \"He's made captain because he's head classic,\" replied Fairbairn; \"it has nothing to do with his being a schoolhouse fellow.\"  \"All very well,\" said Tucker, of Welch's, \"but it's a precious odd thing, all the same, that the captain is always picked out of the schoolhouse.\"  \"And it's a precious odd thing too,\" chimed in Crossfield, \"that a head classic was never to be got out of Welch's for love or money!\"  This turned the laugh against the unlucky Tucker, who was notoriously a long way off being head classic.  \"What I say is,\" said Game, \"we want an all-round man for captain--a fellow like Bloomfield here, who's well up in the Sixth, and far away the best fellow in the eleven and the boats.  Besides, he doesn't shut himself up like Riddell, and give himself airs.  I can't see why the doctor didn't name him.  The only thing against him seems to be that he's not a schoolhouse gentleman.\"  \"That's the best thing about him in my opinion,\" said Ashley.  If Game and his friends had determined to do their best to gain friends for the new captain, this constant bringing-up of the rivalry between Parrett's house and the schoolhouse was the very way to do it.  Many of the schoolhouse monitors had felt as sore as anybody about the appointments, but this sort of talk inclined not a few of them to take Riddell's side.  \"I don't want any row made on my account,\" said Bloomfield.  \"If Paddy thinks Riddell's the best man, we have no choice in the matter.\"  \"Haven't we, though!\" said Wibberly.  \"We aren't going to have a fellow put over our heads against our will--at any rate, not without having a word in the matter.\"  \"What can you do?\" asked Coates.  \"We can resign, I suppose?\" said Tucker.  \"Oh, yes!\" said Crossfield.  \"And suppose Paddy took you at your word, my boy?  Sad thing for Welch's that would be!\"  \"I don't know why you choose to make a beast of yourself whenever I speak,\" said Tucker, angrily; \"I've as much right--\"  \"Shut up, Tucker, for goodness' sake!\" said Bloomfield; \"don't begin by quarrelling.\"  \"Well, then, what does he want to cheek me for?\" demanded Tucker.  \"He's a stuck-up schoolhouse prig, that's what he is!\"  \"And if I only had the flow of costermonger's talk which some people possess--\" began Crossfield.  \"Are you going to shut up or not?\" demanded Bloomfield.  \"Hullo! you aren't captain yet, old man!\" replied the irrepressible Crossfield; \"but if you want to know, I am going to shut up now till I want to speak again.\"  \"We might get up a petition to the doctor, anyhow,\" suggested Game, returning to the subject; \"he'd have to take notice of that.\"  \"What will you say in the petition?\" asked Porter.  \"Oh! easy enough that.  Say we don't consider Riddell fit to be captain, and we'd sooner have some one else.\"  \"Better say we'd sooner have Bloomfield at once,\" said Wibberly.  \"No; please don't mention my name,\" said Bloomfield.  \"Wouldn't the best thing be to send Riddell back with a label, `Declined, with thanks,' pinned on his coat-tail?\" suggested Crossfield.  \"Yes; and add, `Try again, Paddy,'\" said Coates, laughing.  \"And just mention no schoolhouse snobs are wanted,\" said Tucker.  \"And suggest, mildly, that a nice, clever, amiable, high-principled Welcher like Tom Tucker would be acceptable,\" added Crossfield.  \"Look here,\" said Tucker, very red in the face, advancing towards his tormentor, \"I've stood your impudence long enough, you cad, and I won't stand any more.\"  \"Sit down, then,\" replied Crossfield, cheerfully, \"plenty of forms.\"  \"Look here, you fellows,\" said Bloomfield again, \"for goodness' sake shut up.  Have it out afterwards if you like, but don't fight here.\"  \"I don't mind where I have it out,\" growled Tucker, \"but I'll teach him to cheek me, see if I don't.\"  So saying, much to the relief of every one, he turned on his heel and left the room.  After this the discussion again got round to Riddell, and the question of a petition was revived.  \"It would be quite easy to draw something up that would say what we want to say and not give offence to any one,\" said Ashley.  \"But what do you want to say?\" asked Fairbairn.  \"If you want to tell the doctor he's wrong, and that we are the people to set him right, I don't see how you can help offending him.\"  \"That's not what we want to say at all,\" said Game.  \"We want to say that the captain of Willoughby has always been a fellow who was good all round, and we think the new captain ought to be of the same sort for the sake of the school.\"  \"Hear, hear,\" said one or two of Parrett's house; \"what could be better than that?\"  \"Well,\" said Porter, \"I don't see much difference between saying that and telling the doctor he doesn't know what he's about.\"  \"Of course _you_ say so--that's your schoolhouse prejudice,\" replied Wibberly.  \"It's nothing of the sort,\" said Fairbairn, warmly; \"you know that as well as I do, Wibberly.\"  \"I know it is,\" retorted Wibberly; \"you'd put up with anybody as long as he wasn't a Parrett fellow.\"  And so the wrangle went on; and at the end of it the company was as near agreeing as they had been at the beginning.  Finally one or two of the schoolhouse fellows, such as Fairbairn, Coates, and Porter, withdrew, and the Parrett faction, having it then pretty much their own way, drew up the following petition:  \"We the undersigned monitors respectfully hope you will reconsider your decision as to the New Captain.  The captain has hitherto always been an `all-round man,' and we think it would be best for the discipline of the school to have a fellow of the same sort now.  We wish to say nothing against Riddell except that we do not think he is the best fellow for the position.  We hope you will excuse us for stating our opinion.\"  To this extraordinary document all the monitors of Parrett's and Welch's houses present put their names, as well as Gilks and one or two others of the schoolhouse, and after deciding not to present it till next day, by which time it was hoped other signatures might be procured, the august assembly broke up.  The reign of Riddell had not, to say the least of it, opened auspiciously as far as his fellow-monitors were concerned.  And outside that body, in Willoughby at large, things did not look much more promising.  The feeling in Parrett's house was of course one of unmingled wrath and mutiny.  When once the heads of the house were known to have declared so unmistakably against the new captain, it was not much to be wondered at that the rank and file followed their lead in a still more demonstrative manner.  It happened that Parson and his friends, Telson (who, though a schoolhouse boy, seemed to live most of his life in Parrett's), King, Wakefield, and Lawkins, had planned a little expedition up the river between third school and \"call-over\" that afternoon, and the present state of affairs in the school formed a rather lively topic of discussion for these worthies as they pulled the Parrett's \"Noah's Ark\"--by which complimentary title the capacious boat devoted to the use of the juniors of the house was known--lazily up on the tide towards Balsham.  The river was pretty full, as usual at that time of day, and as one form which the wrath of the youthful Parretts took was to insult, and if opportunity arose, to run down the craft of either of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21049"],["title","The Curlytops and Their Pets; Or, Uncle Toby's Strange Collection (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: ONE OF THE TRICKS WAS TO RUN AND JUMP THROUGH A PAPER HOOP.               \"The Curlytops and Their Pets\"                     Page 240]                             THE CURLYTOPS                               AND                            THEIR PETS                                OR                   _Uncle Toby's Strange Collection_                                  BY                          HOWARD R.

What you going to load on your ship, Jan?\"  \"Oranges and lemons and pineapples,\" answered the little girl, who was playing with her brother at sailing boats in the brook that ran back of the house. \"And maybe I'll have gold and diamonds and chocolate cake on my ship, Teddy,\" went on Janet Martin.  \"If you do I'll be a pirate and sink your ship! Oh, Jan, let's play that! I'll be a pirate!\"  Teddy Martin jumped up so suddenly from the bank of the brook, where he was loading his ship with what he called \"swords, guns and gunpowder,\" that he tipped the vessel over and the whole cargo was spilled into the water.  \"Oh, look what you did!\" cried Janet. \"Your gunpowder will be all wet!\"  \"I'm not ready to play the pirate game yet,\" explained Teddy. \"Anyhow, I can get more powder.\"  This would be easy enough, it seemed, as the children were only pretending that stones, pebbles and bits of sticks were the cargoes of their toy ships, and, as Teddy had said, he could easily get more stones. The brook was filled with them.  \"Where are you going?\" Janet called after her brother, as she saw him hurrying toward the house, which was out of sight behind the trees and bushes that grew on the edge of the brook.  \"I'm going to get a black flag so I can be a pirate and sink your ship with gold, diamonds and chocolate cakes on!\" answered Teddy over his shoulder as he ran on.  \"I--I don't guess I want you to be a pirate,\" said Janet slowly, as she looked at her ship, on which the pebbles, stones and bits of wood were neatly arranged in piles. \"I'm not going to play that game! I don't want you to be a pirate, Ted! It's too scary!\"  But her brother was beyond the reach of her voice now, hurrying toward the house after his \"black pirate flag.\" Janet shoved her ship out from the shore--her ship laden with diamonds, gold and chocolate cakes. Of course it was not a real ship. The Curlytops would not have had half as much fun with real ships as they were having with the pieces of boards which they were making believe were steamers and sailing vessels.  \"I'll sail my ship away down to the end of the brook before Ted gets back to be a pirate,\" said Janet to herself, as, with a long stick, she directed the flat board which was piled high with brook-pebbles. \"Then when he comes back he can't sink it.\"  Janet pushed her ship slowly at first, and then a little faster, moving it along by means of the stick while she stood on the bank. Then, hearing a noise in the bushes behind her, she thrust harder on the stick.  \"I don't want Teddy to pirate my ship!\" she thought. \"I'll fool him! I'll sail it around the bend, and then I'll hide behind the big buttonball tree and he won't know where I've gone!\"  In order to do this Janet wanted to make her ship go as fast as possible, so she shoved harder and harder on the stick. And then, all of a sudden, her ship upset.  With a splash the stones, pebbles and bits of wood went into the brook. The whole cargo was sunk and lost as surely as if Ted's pirate vessel had captured that of his sister. That is, everything sank but the ship itself and the cargo of little sticks, some of which Janet was pretending were chocolate cakes. Even at that, I suppose, the chocolate cakes would be wet and soggy. And soggy chocolate cake isn't good to eat. The best thing you can do with it is to make it into a pudding.  \"Oh, Ted! look what you made me do,\" cried Janet sadly, as she saw the ship, which she had loaded with such care, capsized and cleared of its cargo. \"It's all your fault!\"  And then she started in surprise as a babyish voice replied:  \"I 'idn't do nuffin! I 'ust comed! What's matter, Jan?\"  \"Oh, it's you, is it, Trouble?\" asked the girl, as she turned and saw, instead of Teddy, her smaller brother William, more often called \"Trouble,\" because he was in it so often.  \"Yep! Me is here!\" announced Trouble. Sometimes he talked more correctly than this, and his mother had told Janet and Teddy to try to cure him of his baby talk and the wrong use of words. But Ted and Jan thought it was \"cute\" to hear Trouble say queer things, so they did not mend his talk as often as they might.  \"I thought you were Ted,\" went on Janet. \"Did you see him? He went up to the house to get a flag.\"  \"Flag,\" returned Trouble, in a questioning voice. \"Goin' to be soldiers an' have a 'rade?\" He meant parade, of course.  \"No, we aren't going to have a parade now, Trouble,\" said Janet. \"Ted went to get a black flag to be a pirate, so he could sink my ship that was loaded with diamonds, gold and chocolate cakes.\"  \"I want chocolate cake--two pieces!\" demanded Trouble, who had ears only for the last words of his sister.  \"There wasn't any chocolate cake--really, dear,\" explained the little girl, as she ruffled up her curly hair. \"Ted and I were just pretending. He is going to have a pirate ship. I didn't want him to get mine, so I was shoving it hard down the brook, but I made it go too fast and it upset. Now I've got to load my ship all over again.\"  \"I want s'ip!\" demanded William, as Jan began to guide her empty vessel back to shore by means of the long stick. \"Trouble have a s'ip?\" he asked.  \"Yes, you may have a ship, and play with us,\" Janet said, and as she was looking about for a board which might serve her little brother to play with, she heard someone coming through the bushes.  \"I guess this is Ted,\" thought Janet. \"Anyhow he can't sink my ship now. I did it myself.\"  It was her older brother, and he now came bursting through the shrubbery that lined the bank of the brook, holding in his hands a piece of black cloth.  \"I got the pirate flag!\" cried Teddy. \"Whoop-la! Now I'm going to sink your ship! Why, what happened?\" he asked, as he saw that Janet's craft was empty. \"Did Trouble upset it?\"  \"No, I did it myself,\" Janet answered. \"But I didn't mean to. I was trying to hide it from you, 'cause I don't want you to be a pirate and upset my ship full of chocolate cakes.\"  \"Oh, I must be a pirate! Here's the black flag and I must be a pirate!\" shouted Teddy. \"Whoop! I'm a pirate! I'm a pirate!\"  \"Hoo! Hoo! Hoop!\" yelled Trouble, trying to make as much noise as his brother.  \"You sound more like an Indian than you do a pirate,\" said Janet, as she began to pile more pebbles on the board that was her ship.  \"Well, Indians and pirates are 'most the same,\" declared Teddy. \"Wait till you see my ship, with swords and guns and powder! It will blow your ship out"]]]
