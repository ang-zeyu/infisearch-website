Thought I'd forgotten all the astronomy you ever taught me, didn't you? Think you can find it?\"  \"Sure. Declination about minus twenty, as I remember it, and right ascension between six and seven hours. Let's see--where would that be from our course?\"  He thought for a moment, manipulated several levers and dials, snapped off the lights, and swung number one exterior visiplate around, directly before their eyes.  \"Oh.... Oh ... this is magnificent, Dick!\" she exclaimed. \"It's stupendous. It seems as though we were right out there in space itself, and not in here at all. It's ... it's just too perfectly darn wonderful!\"  Although neither of them was unacquainted with interstellar space, it presents a spectacle that never fails to awe even the most seasoned observer: and no human being had ever before viewed the wonders of space from such a coign of vantage. Thus the two fell silent and awed as they gazed out into the abysmal depths of the interstellar void. The darkness of Earthly night is ameliorated by light-rays scattered by the atmosphere: the stars twinkle and scintillate and their light is diffused, because of the same medium. But here, what a contrast! They saw the utter, absolute darkness of the complete absence of all light: and upon that indescribable blackness they beheld superimposed the almost unbearable brilliance of enormous suns concentrated into mathematical points, dimensionless. Sirius blazed in blue-white splendor, dominating the lesser members of his constellation, a minute but intensely brilliant diamond upon a field of black velvet--his refulgence unmarred by any trace of scintillation or distortion.  As Seaton slowly shifted the field of vision, angling toward and across the celestial equator and the ecliptic, they beheld in turn mighty Rigel; The Belt, headed by dazzlingly brilliant-white Delta-Orionis; red Betelguese; storied Aldebaran, the friend of mariners; and the astronomically constant Pleiades.  Seaton's arm contracted, swinging Dorothy into his embrace; their lips met and held.  \"Isn't it wonderful, lover,\" she murmured, \"to be out here in space this way, together, away from all our troubles and worries? I am so happy.\"  \"It's all of that, sweetheart mine!\"  \"I almost died, every time they shot at you. Suppose your armor cracked or something? I wouldn't want to go on living--I'd just naturally die!\"  \"I'm glad it didn't--and I'm twice as glad that they didn't succeed in grabbing you away from me....\" His jaw set rigidly, his gray eyes became hard as tempered drills. \"Blackie DuQuesne has something coming to him. So far, I have always paid my debts.... I shall settle with him ... IN FULL.\"  \"That was an awfully quick change of subject,\" he continued, his voice changing instantly into a lighter vein, \"but that's one penalty of being human. We can't live in high altitudes all our lives--if we could there would be no thrill in ascending them so often.  \"Yes, we love each other just the same--more than anybody else I ever heard of.\" After a moment she eyed him shrewdly and continued:  \"You've got something on your mind besides that tangled mop of hair, big boy. Tell it to Red-Top.\"  \"Nothing much....\"  \"Come on, 'fess up--it's good for the soul. You can't fool your own wife, guy; I know your little winning ways too well.\"  \"Let me finish, woman; I was about to bare my very soul. To resume--nothing much to go on but a hunch, but I think DuQuesne's somewhere out here in the great open spaces, where men are sometimes schemers as well as men; and if so, I'm after him--foot, horse, and marines.\"  \"That object compass?\"  \"Yes. You see, I built that thing myself, and I know darn well it isn't out of order. It's still on him, but doesn't indicate. Ergo, he is too far away to reach--and with his weight, I could find him anywhere up to about one and a half light-years. If he wants to go that far away from home, where is his logical destination? It can't be anywhere but Osnome, since that is the only place we stopped at for any length of time--the only place where he could have learned anything. He's learned something, or found something useful to him there, just as we did. That is certain, since he is not the type of man to do anything without a purpose. Uncle Dudley is on his trail--and will be able to locate him pretty soon.\"  \"When will you get that new compass-case exhausted to a skillionth of a whillimeter or something, whatever it is? I thought Dunark said it took five hundred hours of pumping to get it where he wanted it?\"  \"It did him--but while the Osnomians are wonders at some things, they're not so hot at others. You see, I've got three pumps on that job, in series. First, a Rodebush-Michalek super-pump[A] then, backing that, an ordinary mercury-vapor pump, and last, backing both the others, a Cenco-Hyvac motor-driven oil pump. In less than fifty hours that case will be as empty as a flapper's skull. Just to make sure of cleaning up the last infinitesimal traces, though, I'm going to flash a getter charge of tantalum in it. After that, the atmosphere in that case will be tenuous--take my word for it.\"      [A] J. Am. Chem. Soc. 51: 3, 750.  \"I'll have to; most of that contribution to science being over my head like a circus tent. What say we let _Skylark Two_ drift by herself for a while, and catch us some of Nature's sweet restorer?\"     CHAPTER IV  The Zone of Force Is Tested   Seaton strode into the control room with a small oblong box in his hand. Crane was seated at the desk, poring over an abstruse mathematical treatise in _Science_. Margaret was working upon a bit of embroidery. Dorothy, seated upon a cushion on the floor with one foot tucked under her, was reading, her hand straying from time to time to a box of chocolates conveniently near.  \"Well, this is a peaceful, home-like scene--too bad to bust it up. Just finished sealing off and flashing out this case, Mart. Going to see if she'll read. Want to take a look?\"  He placed the compass upon the plane table, so that its final bearing could be read upon the master circles controlled by the gyroscopes; then simultaneously started his stop-watch and pressed the button which caused a minute couple to be applied to the needle. Instantly the needle began to revolve, and for many minutes there was no apparent change in its motion in either the primary or secondary bearings.  \"Do you suppose it is out of order, after all?\" asked Crane, regretfully.  \"I don't think so,\" Seaton pondered. \"You see, they weren't designed to indicate such distances on such small objects as men, so I threw a million ohms in series with the impulse. That cuts down the free rotation to less than half an hour, and increases the sensitivity to the limit. There, isn't she trying to quit it?\"  \"Yes, it is settling down. It must be on him still.\" Finally the ultra-sensitive needle came to rest. When it had done so, Seaton calculated the distance, read the direction, and made a reading upon Osnome.  \"He's there, all right. Bearings agree, and distances check to within a light-year, which is as close as we can hope to check on as small a mass as a man. Well, that's that--nothing to do about it until after we get there. One sure thing, Mart--we're not coming straight back home from 'X'.\"  \"No, an investigation is indicated.\"  \"Well, that puts me out of a job. What to do? Don't want to study, like you. Can't crochet, like Peg. Darned if I'll sit cross-legged on a pillow and eat candy, like that Titian blonde over there on the floor. I know what--I'll build me a mechanical educator and teach Shiro to talk English instead of that mess of language he indulges in. How'd that be, Mart?\"  \"Don't do it,\" put in Dorothy, positively. \"He's just too perfect the way he is. Especially don't do it if he'd talk the way you do--or could you teach him to talk the way you write?\"  \"Ouch! That's a dirty dig. However, Mrs. Seaton, I am able and willing to defend my customary mode of speech. You realize that the spoken word is ephemeral, whereas the thought, whose nuances have once been expressed in imperishable print is not subject to revision--its crudities can never be remodeled into more subtle, more gracious shading. It is my contention that, due to these inescapable conditions, the mental effort necessitated by the employment of nice distinctions in sense and meaning of words and a slavish adherence to the dictates of the more precise grammarians should be reserved for the print....\"  He broke off as Dorothy, in one lithe motion, rose and hurled her pillow at his head.  \"Choke him, somebody! Perhaps you had better build it, Dick, after all.\"  \"I believe that he would like it, Dick. He is trying hard to learn, and the continuous use of a dictionary is undoubtedly a nuisance to him.\"  \"I'll ask him. Shiro!\"  \"You have call, sir?\" Shiro entered the room from his galley, with his unfailing bow.  \"Yes. How'd you like to learn to talk English like Crane there does--without taking lessons?\"  Shiro smiled doubtfully, unable to take such a thought seriously.  \"Yes, it can be done,\" Crane assured him. \"Doctor Seaton can build a machine which will teach you all at once, if you like.\"  \"I like, sir, enormously, yes, sir. I years study and pore, but honorable English extraordinary difference from Nipponese--no can do. Dictionary useful but ...\" he flipped pages dexterously, \"extremely cumbrous. If honorable Seaton can do, shall be extreme ... gratification.\"  He bowed again, smiled, and went out.  \"I'll do just that little thing. So long, folks, I'm going up to the shop.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Day after day the _Skylark_ plunged through the vast emptiness of the interstellar reaches. At the end of each second she was traveling exactly twenty-six feet per second faster than she had been at its beginning; and as day after day passed, her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21051"],["title","Skylark Three (#7)"],["body","mounted into figures which became meaningless, even when expressed in thousands of miles per second. Still she seemed stationary to her occupants, and only different from a vessel motionless upon the surface of the Earth in that objects within her hull had lost three-sixteenths of their normal weight. Acceleration, too, had its effect. Only the rapidity with which the closer suns and their planets were passed gave any indication of the frightful speed at which they were being hurtled along by the inconceivable power of that disintegrating copper bar.  When the vessel was nearly half-way to \"X,\" the bar was reversed in order to change the sign of their acceleration, and the hollow sphere spun through an angle of one hundred and eighty degrees around the motionless cage which housed the enormous gyroscopes. Still apparently motionless and exactly as she had been before, the _Skylark_ was now actually traveling in a direction which seemed \"down\" and with a velocity which was being constantly decreased by the amount of their negative acceleration.  A few days after the bar had been reversed Seaton announced that the mechanical educator was complete, and brought it into the control room.  In appearance it was not unlike a large radio set, but it was infinitely more complex. It possessed numerous tubes, kino-lamps, and photo-electric cells, as well as many coils of peculiar design--there were dozens of dials and knobs, and a multiple set of head-harnesses.  \"How can a thing like that possibly work as it does?\" asked Crane. \"I know that it does work, but I could scarcely believe it, even after it had educated me.\"  \"That is nothing like the one Dunark used, Dick,\" objected Dorothy. \"How come?\"  \"I'll answer you first, Dot. This is an improved model--it has quite a few gadgets of my own in it. Now, Mart, as to how it works--it isn't so funny after you understand it--it's a lot like radio in that respect. It operates on a band of frequencies lying between the longest light and heat waves and the shortest radio waves. This thing here is the generator of those waves and a very heavy power amplifier. The headsets are stereoscopic transmitters, taking or receiving a three-dimensional view. Nearly all matter is transparent to those waves; for instance bones, hair, and so on. However, cerebin, a cerebroside peculiar to the thinking structure of the brain, is opaque to them. Dunark, not knowing chemistry, didn't know why the educator worked or what it worked on--he found out by experiment that it did work; just as we found out about electricity. This three-dimensional model, or view, or whatever you want to call it, is converted into electricity in the headsets, and the resulting modulated wave goes back to the educator. There it is heterodyned with another wave--this second frequency was found after thousands of trials and is, I believe, the exact frequency existing in the optic nerves themselves--and sent to the receiving headset. Modulated as it is, and producing a three-dimensional picture, after rectification in the receiver, it reproduces exactly what has been 'viewed,' if due allowance has been made for the size and configuration of the different brains involved in the transfer. You remember a sort of flash--a sensation of seeing something--when the educator worked on you? Well, you did see it, just as though it had been transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve, but everything came at once, so the impression of sight was confused. The result in the brain, however, was clear and permanent. The only drawback is that you haven't the visual memory of what you have learned, and that sometimes makes it hard to use your knowledge. You don't know whether you know anything about a certain subject or not until after you go digging around in your brain looking for it.\"  \"I see,\" said Crane, and Dorothy, the irrepressible, put in:  \"Just as clear as so much mud. What are the improvements you added to the original design?\"  \"Well, you see, I had a big advantage in knowing that cerebrin was the substance involved, and with that knowledge I could carry matters considerably farther than Dunark could in his original model. I can transfer the thoughts of somebody else to a third party or to a record. Dunark's machine couldn't work against resistance--if the subject wasn't willing to give up his thoughts he couldn't get them. This one can take them away by force. In fact, by increasing plate and grid voltages in the amplifier, I can pretty nearly burn out a man's brain. Yesterday, I was playing with it, transferring a section of my own brain to a magnetized tape--for a permanent record, you know--and found out that above certain rather low voltages it becomes a form of torture that would make the best efforts of the old Inquisition seem like a petting party.\"  \"Did you succeed in the transfer?\" Crane was intensely interested.  \"Sure. Push the button for Shiro, and we'll start something.\"  \"Put your head against this screen,\" he directed when Shiro had come in, smiling and bowing as usual. \"I've got to caliper your brains to do a good job.\"  The calipering done, he adjusted various dials and clamped the electrodes over his own head and over the heads of Crane and Shiro.  \"Want to learn Japanese while we're at it, Mart? I'm going to.\"  \"Yes, please. I tried to learn it while I was in Japan, but it was altogether too difficult to be worth while.\"  Seaton threw in a switch, opened it, depressed two more, opened them, and threw off the power.  \"All set,\" he reported crisply, and barked a series of explosive syllables at Shiro, ending upon a rising note.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered the Japanese. \"You speak Nipponese as though you had never spoken any other tongue. I am very grateful to you, sir, that I may now discard my dictionary.\"  \"How about you two girls--anything you want to learn in a hurry?\"  \"Not me!\" declared Dorothy emphatically. \"That machine is too darn weird to suit me. Besides, if I knew as much about science as you do, we'd probably fight about it.\"  \"I do not believe I care to....\" began Margaret.  She was interrupted by the penetrating sound of an alarm bell.  \"That's a new note!\" exclaimed Seaton, \"I never heard that note before.\"  He stood in surprise at the board, where a brilliant purple light was flashing slowly. \"Great Cat! That's a purely Osnomian war-gadget--kind of a battleship detector--shows that there's a boatload of bad news around here somewhere. Grab the visiplates quick, folks,\" as he rang Shiro's bell. \"I'll take visiplate area one, dead ahead. Mart, take number two. Dot, three; Peg, four; Shiro, five. Look sharp!... Nothing in front. See anything, any of you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  None of them could discover anything amiss, but the purple light continued to flash, and the bell to ring. Seaton cut off the bell.  \"We're almost to 'X',\" he thought aloud. \"Can't be more than a million miles or so, and we're almost stopped. Wonder if somebody's there ahead of us? Maybe Dunark is doing this, though. I'll call him and see.\" He threw in a switch and said one word--\"Dunark!\"  \"Here!\" came the voice of the Kofedix from the speaker. \"Are you generating?\"  \"No--just called to see if you were. What do you make of it?\"  \"Nothing as yet. Better close up?\"  \"Yes, edge over this way and I'll come over to meet you. Leave your negative as it is--we'll be stopped directly. Whatever it is, it's dead ahead. It's a long ways off yet, but we'd better get organized. Wouldn't talk much, either--they may intercept our wave, narrow as it is.\"  \"Better yet, shut off your radio entirely. When we get close enough together, we'll use the hand-language. You may not know that you know it, but you do. Turn your heaviest searchlight toward me--I'll do the same.\"  There was a click as Dunark's power was shut off abruptly, and Seaton grinned as he cut his own.  \"That's right, too, folks. In Osnomian battles we always used a sign-language when we couldn't hear anything--and that was most of the time. I know it as well as I know English, now that I am reminded of the fact.\"  He shifted his course to intercept that of the Osnomian vessel. After a time the watchers picked out a minute point of light, moving comparatively rapidly against the stars, and knew it to be the searchlight of the _Kondal_. Soon the two vessels were almost side by side, moving cautiously forward, and Seaton set up a sixty-inch parabolic reflector, focused upon a coil. As they went on, the purple light continued to flash more and more rapidly, but still nothing was to be seen.  \"Take number six visiplate, will you, Mart? It's telescopic, equivalent to a twenty-inch refractor. I'll tell you where to look in a minute--this reflector increases the power of the regular indicator.\" He studied meters and adjusted dials. \"Set on nineteen hours forty-three minutes, and two hundred seventy-one degrees. He's too far away yet to read exactly, but that'll put him in the field of vision.\"  \"Is this radiation harmful?\" asked Margaret.  \"Not yet--it's too weak. Pretty soon we may be able to feel it; then I'll throw out a screen against it. When it's strong enough, it's pretty deadly stuff. See anything, Mart?\"  \"I see something, but it is very indistinct. It is moving in sharper now. Yes, it is a space-ship, shaped like a dirigible airship.\"  \"See it yet, Dunark?\" Seaton signaled.  \"Just sighted it. Ready to attack?\"  \"I am not. I'm going to run. Let's go, and go fast!\"  Dunark signaled violently, and Seaton shook his head time after time, stubbornly.  \"A difficulty?\" asked Crane.  \"Yes. He wants to go jump on it, but I'm not looking for trouble with any such craft as that--it must be a thousand feet long and is certainly neither Terrestrial nor Osnomian. I say beat it while we're all in one piece. How about it?\"  \"Absolutely,\" concurred Crane and both women.  The bar was reversed and the _Skylark_ leaped away. The _Kondal_ followed, although the observers could"]]]
