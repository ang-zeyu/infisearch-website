This he proposed to show me, in order that I might pronounce an opinion as to the correctness of the likeness; but on instituting a search for it, he discovered--much to my relief, I must confess--that he had left it, with his purse, in the pocket of his other jacket.  The wine at length finished, we parted company at the door of the \"Blue Posts;\" I shaping a course homeward, and my new friends heading in the direction of the Hard, their uproarious laughter reaching my ear for some time after they had passed out of sight.    CHAPTER TWO.  I QUIT THE PATERNAL ROOF.  On reaching home I found that my father had preceded me by a few minutes only, and was to be found in the surgery.  Thither, accordingly, I hastened to give him an opportunity of seeing me in my new rig.  \"Good Heavens, boy!\" he exclaimed when he had taken in all the details of my appearance, \"do you mean to say that you have presented yourself in public in that extraordinary guise?\"  I respectfully intimated that I had, and that, moreover, I failed to observe anything at all extraordinary in my appearance.  \"Well,\" observed he, bursting into a fit of hearty laughter, notwithstanding his evident annoyance, \"_you_ may not have noticed it; but I'll warrant that everybody else has.  Why, I should not have been surprised to hear that you had found yourself the laughing-stock of the town.  Run away, Dick, and change your clothes at once; Shears must see those things and endeavour to alter them somehow; you can never wear them as they are.\"  I slunk away to my room in a dreadfully depressed state of mind.  Was it possible that what my father had said was true!  A sickening suspicion seized me that it _was_; and that I had at last found an explanation of the universal laughter which had seemed to accompany me everywhere in my wanderings that wretched afternoon.  I wrapped up the now hated uniform in the brown paper which had encased it when it came from Shears; and my father and I were about to sally forth with it upon a wrathful visit to the erring Shears, when a breathless messenger from him arrived with another parcel, and a note of explanation and apology, to the effect that by some unfortunate blunder the wrong suit had been sent home, and Mr Shears would feel greatly obliged if we would return it per bearer.  The man, upon this, was invited inside and requested to wait whilst I tried on the rightful suit, which was found to fit excellently; and I could not avoid laughing rather ruefully as I looked in the glass and contrasted my then appearance with that which I remembered it to have been in the earlier part of the day.  Later on, that same evening, my sea-chest and the remainder of my outfit arrived; and I was ready to join, as had been already arranged, on the following day.  The eventful morning at length arrived; and with my enthusiasm considerably cooled by a night of sleepless excitement and the unpleasant consciousness that I was about, in an hour or two more, to bid a long farewell to home and all who loved me, I descended to the breakfast-room.  My father was already there; but Eva did not come down until the last moment; and when she made her appearance it was evident that she had very recently been weeping.  The dear girl kissed me silently with quivering lips, and we sat down to breakfast.  My father made two or three efforts to start something in the shape of a conversation, but it was no good; the dear old gentleman was himself manifestly ill at ease; Eva could not speak a word for sobbing; and as for me, I was as unable to utter a word as I was to swallow my food--a great lump had gathered in my throat, which not only made it sore but also threatened to choke me, and it was with the utmost difficulty that I avoided bursting into a passion of tears.  None of us ate anything, and at length the wretched apology for a meal was brought to a conclusion, my father read a chapter from the Bible, and we knelt down to prayers.  I will not attempt to repeat here the words of his supplication.  Suffice it to say that they went straight to my heart and lodged there, their remembrance encompassing me about as with a seven- fold defence in many a future hour of trial and temptation.  On rising from his knees my father invited me to accompany him to his consulting-room, and on arriving there he handed me a chair, seated himself directly in front of me, and said:  \"Now, my dear boy, before you leave the roof which has sheltered you from your infancy, and go forth to literally fight your own way through the world, there is just a word or two of caution and advice which I wish to say.  You are about to embark in a profession of your own deliberate choice, and whilst that profession is of so honourable a character that all who wear its uniform are unquestioningly accepted as gentlemen, it is also one which, from its very nature, exposes its followers to many and great temptations.  I will not enlarge upon these; you are now old enough to understand the nature of many of them, and those which you may not at present know anything about will be readily recognisable as such when they present themselves; and a few simple rules will, I trust, enable you to overcome them.  The first rule which I wish you to take for your guidance through life, my son, is this. Never be ashamed to honour your Maker.  Let neither false pride, nor the gibes of your companions, nor indeed _any_ influence whatever, constrain you to deny Him or your dependence upon Him; never take His name in vain, nor countenance by your continued presence any such thing in others.  Bear in mind the fact that He who holds the ocean in the hollow of His hand is also the Guide, the Helper, and the defender of `those who go down into the sea in ships;' and make it an unfailing practice to seek His help and protection every day of your life.  \"Never allow yourself to contract the habit of swearing.  Many men--and, because of their pernicious example, many boys too--habitually garnish their conversation with oaths, profanity, and obscenity of the vilest description.  It _may_ be--though I earnestly hope and pray it will not--that a bad example in this respect will be set you by even your superior officers.  If such should unhappily be the case, think of this, our parting moments, and of my parting advice to you, and never suffer yourself to be led away by such example.  In the first place it is wrong--it is distinctly _sinful_ to indulge in such language; and in the next place, to take much lower ground, it is vulgar, ungentlemanly, and altogether in the very worst possible taste.  It is not even _manly_ to do so, though many lads appear to think it so; there is nothing manly, or noble, or dignified in the utterance of words which inspire in the hearers--unless they be the lowest of the low--nothing save the most extreme disgust.  If you are ambitious to be classed among the vilest and most ruffianly of your species, use such language; but if your ambition soars higher than this, avoid it as you would the pestilence.  \"Be always _strictly_ truthful.  There are two principal incentives to falsehood--vanity and fear.  Never seek self-glorification by a falsehood.  If fame is not to be won legitimately, do without it; and never seek to screen yourself by a falsehood--this is mean and cowardly in the last degree.  `To err is human;' we are all liable to make mistakes sometimes; such a person as an infallible man, woman, or child has never yet existed, and never will exist.  Therefore, if you make a mistake, have the courage to manfully acknowledge it and take the consequences; I will answer for it that they will not be very dreadful. A fault confessed is half atoned.  And, apart from the _morality_ of the thing, let me tell you that a reputation for truthfulness is a priceless possession to a man; it makes his services _doubly_ valuable.  \"Be careful that you are always strictly honest, honourable, and upright in your dealings with others.  Never let your reputation in this respect be sullied by so much as a breath.  And bear this in mind, my boy, it is not sufficient that you should _be_ all this, you must also _seem_ it, that is to say you must keep yourself far beyond the reach of even the barest suspicion.  Many a man who, by carelessness or inexperience, has placed himself in a questionable position, has been obliged to pay the penalty of his want of caution by carrying about with him, to the end of his life, the burden of a false and undeserved suspicion.  \"And now there is only one thing more I wish to caution you against, and that is _vanity_.  It is a failing which is only too plainly perceptible in most boys of your age, and--do not be angry, Dick, if I touch the sore spot with a heavy hand; it is for your own good that I do it--you have it in a very marked degree.  Like most of your compeers you think that, having passed your fourteenth birth-day, you are now a _man_, and in many points I notice that you have already begun to ape the ways of men.  Don't do it, Dick.  Manhood comes not so early; and of all disagreeable and objectionable characters, save me, I pray you, from a boy who mistakes himself for a man.  Manhood, with its countless cares and responsibilities, will come soon enough; whilst you are a boy _be_ a boy; or, if you insist on being a man before your time, cultivate those attributes which are characteristic of _true_ manhood, such as fearless truth, scrupulous honour, dauntless courage, and so on; but _don't_, for Heaven's sake, adopt the follies and vices of men.  As I have said, Dick, vanity is certainly your _great_ weakness, and I want you to be especially on your guard against it.  It will tempt you to tamper with the truth, even if it does no worse,\" (I thought involuntarily of Lady Mary and my tacit admission of the justice of Lord Fitz-Johnes' impeachment of me with regard to her), \"and it is quite possible that it may lead you into a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21060"],["title","The Congo Rovers: A Story of the Slave Squadron (#4)"],["body","scrape.  \"Now, Dick, my boy--my dear son--I have said to you all that I think, even in the slightest degree, necessary by way of caution and advice.  I can only affectionately entreat you to remember and ponder upon my words, and pray God to lead you to a right understanding of them.  \"And now,\" he added, rising from his seat, \"I think it is time you were on the move.  Go and wish Eva good-bye, and then I will drive you down to the Hard--I see Edwards has brought round the carriage.\"  I hurried away to the drawing-room, where I knew I should find my sister, and, opening the door gently, announced that I had come to say good-bye.  The dear girl, upon hearing my voice, rose up from the sofa, in the cushion of which she had been hiding her tear-stained face, and came with unsteady steps toward me.  Then, as I looked into her eyes-- heavy with the mental agony from which she was suffering, and which she bravely strove to hide for my sake--I realised, for the first time in my life, all the horror which lurks in that dreadful word \"Farewell.\" Meaning originally a benediction, it has become by usage the word with which we cut ourselves asunder from all that is nearest and dearest to us; it is the signal for parting; the last word we address to our loved ones; the fatal spell at which they lingeringly and unwillingly withdraw from our clinging embrace; the utterance at which the hand-clasp of friendship or of love is loosed, and we are torn apart never perhaps again to meet until time shall be no more.  My poor sister!  It was pitiful to witness her intense distress.  This was our first parting.  Never before had we been separated for more than an hour or two at a time, and, there being only the two of us, our mutual affection had steadily, though imperceptibly, grown and strengthened from year to year until now, when to say \"good-bye\" seemed like the rending of our heart-strings asunder.  It had to be said, however, and it _was_ said at last--God knows how, for my recollection of our parting moments is nothing more than that of a brief period of acute mental suffering--and then, placing my half- swooning sister upon the couch and pressing a last lingering kiss on her icy-cold lips, I rushed from the room and the house.  My father had already taken his seat in the carriage; my luggage was piled up on the front seat alongside the driver, and nothing therefore remained but for me to jump in, slam-to the door, and we were off.  It seemed equally impossible to my father and to myself to utter a single word during that short--though, in our then condition of acute mental tension, all too long--drive to the Hard; we sat therefore dumbly side by side, with our hands clasped, until the carriage drew up, when I sprang out, hastily hailed a boatman, and then at once began with feverish haste to drag my belongings off the carriage down into the road.  I had still to say good-bye to my father, and I felt that I _must_ shorten the time as much as possible, that ten minutes more of such mental torture would drive me mad.  The boatman quickly shouldered my chest, and, gathering up the remainder of my belongings in his disengaged hand, discreetly trotted off to the wherry, which he unmoored and drew alongside the slipway.  Then I turned to my father, and, with the obtrusive lump in my throat by this time grown so inconveniently large that I could scarcely articulate, held out my hand to him.  \"Good-bye, father!\"  I stammered out huskily.  \"Good-bye, Dick, my son, my own dear boy!\" he returned, not less affected than myself.  \"Good-bye!  May God bless and keep you, and in His own good time bring you in health and safety back to us!  Amen.\"  A quick convulsive hand-clasp, a last hungry glance into the loving face and the sorrow-dimmed eyes which looked so longingly down into mine, and with a hardly-suppressed cry of anguish I tore myself away, staggered blindly down the slipway, tumbled into the boat, and, as gruffly as I could under the circumstances, ordered the boatman to put me on board the _Daphne_.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE TRUTH ABOUT FITZ-JOHNES.  \"Where are we going, Tom?\"  I asked, as the boatman, an old chum of mine, proceeded to step the boat's mast.  \"You surely don't need the sail for a run half-way across the harbour?\"  \"No,\" he answered; \"no, I don't.  But we're bound out to Spithead.  The _Daphne_ went out this mornin' at daylight to take in her powder, and I 'spects she's got half of it stowed away by this time.  Look out for your head, Mr Dick, sir, we shall jibe in a minute.\"  I ducked my head just in time to save my glazed hat from being knocked overboard by the jibing mainsail of the boat, and then drew out my handkerchief and waved another farewell to my father, whose fast- diminishing figure I could still make out standing motionless on the shore, with his hand shading his eyes as he watched the rapidly moving boat.  He waved back in answer, and then the intervening hull of a ship hid him from my view, and I saw him no more for many a long day.  \"Ah, it's a sorry business that, partin' with friends and kinsfolk when you're outward-bound on a long cruise that you can't see the end of!\" commented my old friend Tom; \"but keep up a good heart, Mr Dick; it'll all be made up to yer when you comes home again by and by loaded down to the scuppers with glory and prize-money.\"  I replied somewhat drearily that I supposed it would; and then Tom-- anxious in his rough kindliness of heart to dispel my depression of spirits and prepare me to present myself among my new shipmates in a suitably cheerful frame of mind--adroitly changed the subject and proceeded to put me \"up to a few moves,\" as he expressed it, likely to prove useful to me in the new life upon which I was about to enter.  \"And be sure, Mr Dick,\" he concluded, as we shot alongside the sloop, \"be sure you remember _always_ to touch your hat when you steps in upon the quarter-deck of a man-o'-war, no matter whether 'tis your own ship or a stranger.\"  Paying the old fellow his fare, and parting with him with a hearty shake of the hand, I sprang up the ship's side, and--remembering Tom's parting caution just in the nick of time--presenting myself in due form upon the quarter-deck, where the first lieutenant had posted himself and from which he was directing the multitudinous operations then in progress, reported myself to that much-dreaded official as \"come on board to join.\"  He was a rather tall and decidedly handsome man, with a gentlemanly bearing and a well-knit shapely-looking figure, dark hair and eyes, thick bushy whiskers meeting under the chin, and a clear strong melodious voice, which, without the aid of a speaking-trumpet, he made distinctly heard from one end of the ship to the other.  As he stood there, in an easy attitude with his hands lightly clasped behind his back and his eye taking in, as it seemed at a glance, everything that was going forward, he struck me as the _beau-ideal_ of a naval officer. I took a strong liking to him on the spot, an instinctive prepossession which was afterwards abundantly justified, for Mr Austin--that was his name--proved to be one of the best officers it has ever been my good fortune to serve under.  \"Oh, you're come on board to join, eh?\" he remarked in response to my announcement.  \"I suppose you are the young gentleman about whom Captain Vernon was speaking to me yesterday.  What is your name?\"  I told him.  \"Ah!  Hawkesley! yes, that is the name.  I remember now.  Captain Vernon told me that although you have never been to sea as yet you are not altogether a greenhorn.  What can you do?\"  \"I can hand, reef, and steer, box the compass, pull an oar, or sail a boat; and I know the name and place of every spar, sail, and rope throughout the ship.\"  \"Aha! say you so?  Then you will prove indeed a valuable acquisition. What is the name of this rope?\"  \"The main-topgallant clewline,\" I answered, casting my eye aloft to note the \"lead\" of the rope.  \"Right!\" he replied with a smile.  \"And you have the true nautical pronunciation also, I perceive.  Mr Johnson,\"--to a master's mate who happened to be passing at the moment--\"this is Mr Hawkesley.  Kindly take him under your wing and induct him into his quarters in the midshipmen's berth, if you please.  Don't stop to stow away your things just now, Mr Hawkesley,\" he continued.  \"I shall have an errand for you in a few minutes.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" I replied.  And following my new acquaintance, I first saw to the hoisting in of my traps, and then with them descended to the place which was to be my home for so many months to come.  This was a tolerably roomy but very indifferently lighted cabin on the lower or orlop deck, access to which was gained by the descent of a very steep ladder.  The furniture was of the most meagre description, consisting only of a very solid deal table, two equally solid forms or stools, and a couple of arm-chairs, one at each end of the table, all securely lashed down to the deck.  There was a shelf with a ledge along its front edge, and divisions to form lockers, extending across the after-end of the berth; and under this hung three small book-cases, (which I was given to understand were private property) and a mirror six inches long by four inches wide, before which the \"young gentlemen\"-- four in number, including myself--and the two master's mates had to perform their toilets as best they could.  The fore and after bulkheads of the apartment were furnished with stout hooks to which to suspend our hammocks, which, by the by, when slung, left, I noticed, but a very small space on either side of the table; and depending from a beam overhead there hung a common horn lantern containing the most attenuated candle I ever saw--a veritable \"purser's dip.\"  This lantern, which was suspended over the centre of the table, afforded, except at meal-times or other special occasions, the sole illumination of the place. Although the ship was new, and the"]]]
