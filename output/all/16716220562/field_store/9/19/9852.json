Went the door, and little Mrs Wimble stood gazing at it angrily for a few moments before sitting down and having what she called \"a good cry,\" after which she rose, wiped her eyes, and put away the tea things without partaking of any herself.  \"Poor Jem!\" she said softly; \"I'm afraid I'm very unkind to him sometimes.\"  Just at that moment Jem was sitting on an empty cask, eating his bread and butter, and watching a boat manned by blue-jackets going off to the sloop of war lying out toward the channel, and flying her colours in the evening breeze.  \"Poor little Sally!\" he said to himself.  \"We don't seem to get on somehow, and I'm afraid I'm a bit rough to her; but knives and scissors! What a temper she have got.\"  Meanwhile, in anything but a pleasant frame of mind, Don had gone home to find that the tea was ready, and that he was being treated as a laggard.  \"Come, Lindon,\" said his uncle quietly, \"you have kept us waiting some time.\"  The lad glanced quickly round the well-furnished room, bright with curiosities brought in many a voyage from the west, and with the poison of Mike's words still at work, he wondered how much of what he saw rightfully belonged to him.  The next moment his eyes lit on the soft sweet troubled face of his mother, full of appeal and reproach, and it seemed to Don that his uncle had been upsetting her by an account of his delinquencies.  \"It's top bad, and I don't deserve it,\" he said to himself.  \"Everything seems to go wrong now.  Well, what are you looking at?\" he added, to himself, as he took his seat and stared across at his cousin, the playmate of many years, whose quiet little womanly face seemed to repeat her father's grave, reproachful look, but who, as it were, snatched her eyes away as soon as she met his gaze.  \"They all hate me,\" thought Don, who was in that unhappy stage of a boy's life when help is so much needed to keep him from turning down one of the dark side lanes of the great main route.  \"Been for a walk, Don?\" said his mother with a tender look.  \"No, mother, I only stopped back in the yard a little while.\"  His uncle set down his cup sharply.  \"You have not been keeping that scoundrel Bannock?\" he cried.  \"No, sir; I've been talking to Jem.\"  \"Ho!\" ejaculated the old merchant.  \"That's better.  But you might have come straight home.\"  Don's eyes encountered his Cousin Kitty's just then, as she gave her head a shake to throw back the brown curls which clustered about her white forehead.  She turned her gaze upon her plate, and he could see that she was frowning.  \"Yes,\" thought Don, \"they all dislike me, and I'm only a worry and trouble to my mother.  I wish I was far away--anywhere.\"  He went on with his tea moodily and in silence, paying no heed to the reproachful glances of his mother's eyes, which seemed to him to say, and with some reason, \"Don't be sulky, Don, my boy; try and behave as I could wish.\"  \"It's of no use to try,\" he said to himself; and the meal passed off very silently, and with a cold chill on every one present.  \"I'm very sorry, Laura,\" said her brother, as soon as Don had left the room; \"and I don't know what to do for the best.  I hate finding fault and scolding, but if the boy is in the wrong I must chide.\"  \"Try and be patient with him, Josiah,\" said Mrs Lavington pleadingly. \"He is very young yet.\"  \"Patient?  I'm afraid I have been too patient.  That scoundrel at the yard has unsettled him with his wild tales of the sea; and if I allowed it, Don would make him quite a companion.\"  \"But, Josiah--\"  \"There, don't look like that, my dear.  I promised you I would play a father's part to the boy, and I will; but you must not expect me to be a weak indulgent father, and spoil him with foolish lenity.  There, enough for one day.  I daresay we shall get all right in time.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" cried Mrs Lavington, earnestly.  \"He's a true-hearted, brave boy; don't try to crush him down.\"  \"Crush him, nonsense!\" cried the merchant, angrily.  \"You really are too bad, Laura, and--\"  He stopped, for just then Don re-entered the room to flush up angrily as he saw his mother in tears; and he had heard enough of his uncle's remark and its angry tone to make him writhe.  \"Ill using her now,\" he said to himself, as he set his teeth and walked to the window.  The closing of the door made him start round quickly, to find that his mother was close behind him, and his uncle gone.  \"What has Uncle Jos been saying to you, mother?\" he cried angrily.  \"Nothing--nothing particular, my boy,\" she faltered.  \"He has,\" cried Don fiercely; \"and I won't have it.  He may scold and abuse me as much as he likes, but I will not have him ill use you.\"  \"Ill use me, Don?\" cried Mrs Lavington.  \"Nonsense, my dear boy.  Your uncle is all that is kind and good; and he loves you very dearly, Don, if you could only try--try a little more, my dear boy, to do what he likes, and please him.\"  \"I do try, mother, but it's no good.\"  \"Don't say that, Don.  Try a little harder--for my sake, dear, as well as your own.\"  \"I have tried, I am always trying, and it's of no use.  Nothing pleases uncle, and the men in the yard know it.\"  \"Don, my boy, what foolish obstinate fit is this which has come over you?\" said Mrs Lavington tenderly.  \"I'm not obstinate,\" he said sullenly; \"only unhappy.\"  \"Is it not your own fault, my darling?\" she whispered; \"believe me, your uncle is one of the kindest and best of men.\"  Don shook his head.  \"Are you going to prefer the opinion of the men of the yard to mine, dear?\"  \"No, mother, but uncle is your brother, and you believe in him and defend him.  You know how harsh and unkind he is to me.\"  \"Not unkind, Don, only firm and for your good.  Now come, my boy, do, for my sake, try to drive away these clouds, and let us all be happy once more.\"  \"It's of no use to try, mother; I shall never be happy here, tied down to a desk.  It's like being uncle's slave.\"  \"What am I to say to you, Don, if you talk like this?\" said Mrs Lavington.  \"Believe me you are wrong, and some day you will own it. You will see what a mistaken view you have taken of your uncle's treatment.  There, I shall say no more now.\"  \"You always treat me as if I were a child,\" said Don, bitterly.  \"I'm seventeen now, mother, and I ought to know something.\"  \"Yes, my boy,\" said Mrs Lavington gently; \"at seventeen we think we know a good deal; and at forty we smile as we look back and see what a very little that `good deal' was.\"  Don shook his head.  \"There, we will have no more sad looks.  Uncle is eager to do all he can to make us happy.\"  \"I wish I could think so,\" cried Don, bitterly.  \"You may, my dear.  And now, come, try and throw aside all those fanciful notions about going abroad and meeting with adventures.  There is no place like home, Don, and you will find out some day that is true.\"  \"But I have no home till I make one,\" said the lad gloomily.  \"You have an excellent home here, Don, the gift of one who has kindly taken the place toward you of your father.  There, I will listen to no more from you, for this is all foolish fighting of your worse against your better self.\"  There was a quiet dignity in his mother's words which awed Don for the moment, but the gentle embrace given the next minute seemed to undo that which the firmness had achieved, and that night the cloud over the lad's life seemed darker than ever.  \"She takes uncle's side and thinks he is everything,\" he said gloomily, as he went to bed.  \"She means right, but she is wrong.  Oh, how I wish I could go right away somewhere and begin life all over again.\"  Then he lay down to sleep, but slumber did not come, so he went on thinking of many things, to fall into a state of unconsciousness at last, from which he awoke to the fact that it was day--a very eventful day for him, but he did not awaken to the fact that he was very blind.    CHAPTER THREE.  AN AWKWARD GUINEA.  It was a busy day at the yard, for a part of the lading of a sugar ship was being stored away in Uncle Josiah's warehouses; but from the very commencement matters seemed to go wrong, and the state of affairs about ten o'clock was pretty ably expressed by Jem Wimble, who came up to Don as he was busy with pencil and book, keeping account of the deliveries, and said in a loud voice,--  \"What did your uncle have for breakfast, Mas' Don?\"  \"Coffee--ham--I hardly know, Jem.\"  \"Ho!  Thought p'r'aps it had been cayenne pepper.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  \"Ah, you may say that, but see how he is going it.  'Tarn't my fault that the dock men work so badly, and 'tarn't my fault that Mike isn't here, and--\"  \"Don't stand talking to Wimble, Lindon,\" said a voice sharply, and Uncle Josiah came up to the pair.  \"No, don't go away, Wimble.  Did Bannock say he should stay away to-day?\"  \"Not to me, uncle.\"  \"Nor to me, sir.\"  \"It's very strange, just as we are so busy too.  He has not drawn any money.\"  \"P'r'aps press-gang's got him, sir,\" suggested Jem.  \"Humph!  Hardly likely!\" said Uncle Josiah; and he went on and entered the office, to come out at the end of a few minutes and beckon to Don.  \"Lindon,\" he said, as the lad joined him, \"I left nine guineas and a half in the little mahogany bowl in my desk yesterday.  Whom have you paid?\"  \"Paid?  No one, sir.\"  \"But eight guineas are gone--missing.\"  \"Eight guineas?  Missing, sir?\"  \"Yes, do you know anything about them?\"  \"No, sir.  I--that is--yes, I remember now: I picked up a guinea on the floor, and meant to give it to you.  Here it is: I forgot all about it.\"  Don took a piece of gold from his flap"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],["title","The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#3)"],["body","pocket, and handed it to his uncle, who looked at him so curiously that the boy grew confused.  \"Picked this up on the floor, Lindon?\" said Uncle Josiah.  \"Yes, sir.  It had rolled down by my desk.\"  \"It is very strange,\" said Uncle Josiah, thoughtfully.  \"Well, that leaves seven missing.  You had better look round and see if you can find them.\"  Don felt uncomfortable, he hardly knew why; but it seemed to him that his uncle looked at him doubtingly, and this brought a feeling of hot indignation into the boy's brain.  He turned quickly, however, entered the office, and with his uncle looking on, searched all over the floor.  \"Well?\"  \"There's nothing here, sir.  Of course not,\" cried Don eagerly; \"Mrs Wimble sweeps up every morning, and if there had been she would have found it.\"  Uncle Josiah lifted off his cocked hat, and put it on again wrong way first.  \"This is a very unpleasant affair, Lindon,\" he said.  \"I can afford to lose seven guineas, or seven hundred if it came to that, but I can't afford to lose confidence in those whom I employ.\"  Don felt hot and cold as his uncle walked to the door and called Jem; and as he waited he looked at the map of an estate in the West Indies, all fly-specked and yellow, then at the portraits of three merchant vessels in full sail, all as yellow and fly-specked as the map, and showing the peculiarity emphasised by the ingenious artist, of their sails blown out one way and their house flags another.  \"Surely uncle can't suspect me,\" he said to himself; and then the thought came again--\"surely uncle can't suspect me.\"  \"Come in here, Wimble,\" said Uncle Josiah, very sternly.  Jem took off his hat, and followed him into the office.  \"Some money is missing from my desk, Wimble.  Have you seen it?\"  \"Me, sir?\" said Jem, stooping down and peering in all directions under the desks.  \"No, sir, I harn't seen it.  Let's see, I don't think I've been here only when I locked up.\"  \"By some mischance I left my desk unlocked when I went out in a hurry yesterday.  Lindon here has found one piece on the floor.\"  \"P'r'aps tothers is there, too,\" said Jem eagerly.  \"No; we have looked.  Call your wife.  Perhaps she may have found them when sweeping.\"  \"Not she, sir,\" said Jem.  \"If she had she'd ha' told me.  'Sides, how could they ha' got on the floor?\"  \"That remains to be proved, Wimble,\" said Uncle Josiah, drily.  \"Call your wife.\"  Jem went to the door, rubbing his ear, and as it happened, seeing his wife outside the cottage, telegraphed to her to come by working one arm about furiously.  Little Mrs Wimble came up in a hurry, looking scared.  \"Take off that there dirty apron,\" whispered Jem, making a dash at the offending garment, and snatching back his hand bleeding from the scratch of the pin by which it was fastened.  \"Look at that,\" he began.  \"Then you shouldn't--\"  \"Silence!\" said Uncle Josiah.  \"Mrs Wimble, did you sweep up this room to-day?\"  \"That I did, sir, and dusted too, and if there's any dust, it must be an--\"  \"Hush!  Don't talk so.  Listen to me.  Did you find any money on the floor?\"  \"Sakes alive, sir, no.\"  \"You are quite sure?\"  \"Oh yes, sir, quite sure.  Have you dropped anything?\"  \"Yes!  No!  That will do.\"  Mrs Wimble stared.  \"Don't you hear?\" whispered Jem.  \"Be off!\"  The little woman gave him an angry look, and then hurried from the office, looking put out and hurt.  \"This money must be found,\" said Uncle Josiah sternly, as soon as they were alone.  \"You are sure that you have seen no more, Lindon?\"  \"Quite, uncle.  I'm sorry I forgot about the guinea I found.\"  \"Yes!\" said Uncle Josiah, giving him a quick searching look.  \"You are quite certain, Wimble?\"  \"Me, sir?  Oh, yes; I'm moral sartain.\"  \"I should be sorry to suspect any one, and behave unjustly, but I must have this matter cleared up.  Michael Bannock is away, and I cannot conceive his being absent without money, unless he is ill.  Wimble, go and see.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the yard-man, with alacrity; and he went off shaking his head, as if all this was a puzzle beyond his capacity to comprehend.  \"You had better go to your desk, Lindon,\" said Uncle Josiah, coldly.  Don started, and mounted his stool, but he could not write.  His brain was confused; and from time to time he glanced at the stern-looking old merchant, and tried to grasp his thoughts.  \"Surely uncle can't suspect me--surely he can't suspect me!\" he found himself saying again, and the trouble seemed to increase till he felt as if he must speak out and say how sorry he was that he had picked up the money and forgotten all about it, when Jem returned.  \"He arn't ill, sir,\" said the man eagerly, \"I found him close by, at the Little Half Moon, in the back street.\"  \"Drinking?\"  \"Yes, sir, and treating a lot of his mates.  He wanted me to have some, and when I wouldn't, he said I should, and emptied half a glass over me. See here.\"  He held up one of his broad skirts which was liberally splashed.  Uncle Josiah frowned, and took a turn or two up and down the office. Then he stopped before Jem.  \"Go round to Smithers the constable.  You know: the man who came when the rum was broached.\"  \"Yes, sir, I know.\"  \"Ask Smithers to bring Michael Bannock round here.  I must clear this matter up.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Jem; and he hurried out, while Don drew a long breath.  \"Uncle does not suspect me,\" he said to himself.  \"The scoundrel!  He must have taken advantage of your back being turned to come in here. You did not notice anything, Lindon?\"  \"No, uncle, and I hardly think he could have been left alone.\"  \"But the money is missing; some of it was dropped; this man is always penniless; he has not drawn his wages, and yet he is half tipsy and treating his companions.  I hope I am not suspecting him wrongfully, but it looks bad, Lindon, it looks bad.\"  The old merchant sat down and began to write.  So did Don, who felt better now, and the time glided on till there were the sounds of feet heard in the yard, and directly after Mike, looking very red-eyed and flushed, entered the office, half pushed in by Jem Wimble and a hard-faced ugly man, who had a peculiar chip out of, or dent in, his nose.  \"Morn', master,\" said Mike, boisterously.  \"Couldn't yer get on without yer best man i' th' yard?\"  \"Silence, sir!\" cried Uncle Josiah, turning round, and glaring magisterially at the culprit.  \"Take yer hat off, can't yer?\" cried Jem, knocking it off for him, and then picking it up and handing it.  \"Give man time, Jem Wimble,\" said Mike, with a grimace.  \"Want to pay me what you owes me, master?\"  \"Hold your tongue, sir!  And listen.  Constable, a sum of money has been abstracted from my desk, and this man, who I believe was penniless two days ago, is now staying away from his work treating his friends.\"  \"Steady, master; on'y having a glass.\"  \"He was paying for ale with a guinea when I fetched him out, sir,\" said the constable.  \"Now, Mike, you're wanted for another ugly job, so you may as well clear yourself of this if you can.\"  \"What yer mean with your ugly job?\" said the man, laughing.  \"You'll know soon enough; you and four more are in trouble.  Now then, what money have you got on you?\"  \"None 'tall.\"  \"Out with it.\"  \"Well, only two o' these.  I did have three,\" grumbled the man, reluctantly taking out a couple of guineas from his pocket.  \"Looks bad, sir,\" said the constable.  \"Now then, where did you get them?\"  \"What's that to you?\"  \"Enough for Mr Christmas to charge you with robbing his desk, my lad; and this and what I've got against you will send you to Botany Bay.\"  \"What, me?  Rob a good master?  Not a penny.\"  \"What have you done with the rest?\" continued the constable.  \"Never had no more, and wouldn't have had that if I'd knowed.\"  \"This will do, sir,\" said the constable.  \"You charge him here with stealing money from your desk?\"  \"I am afraid I must,\" said Uncle Josiah.  \"What, me?  Charge me?\" cried the man, angrily.  \"Yes, Bannock, reluctantly; but it seems that you are the thief.\"  \"No: not me!\" cried the man, fiercely.  \"It warn't me.  It was him.\"  Don started and turned pale, as the man stood pointing at him.  \"What do you mean?\" cried Uncle Josiah.  \"Mean?  Why, I ketched him a-helping hisself to the money, and he give me three guineas to hold my tongue.\"  \"What?\"  \"And when I wouldn't take 'em he said if I didn't he'd say it was me; and that's the whole truth, and nothing else.\"  \"Lindon, what have you to say to this?\" cried Uncle Josiah.  Don thought of the guinea he had picked up, of his uncle's curious look when he gave it to him, and as he turned red and white with terror and dismay, mingled with confusion, he tried to speak, but try how he would, no words would come.    CHAPTER FOUR.  MIKE BANNOCK HAS A RIDE.  \"You wretch!\"  Those two words were a long time coming, but when they did escape from Lindon's lips, they made up in emphasis and force for their brevity.  \"Steady, Master Don, steady,\" said Jem, throwing his arms round the boy's waist, and holding him back.  \"You arn't strong enough to fight him.\"  \"Wretch?  Oh!  Well, I like that.  Why, some men would ha' gone straight to your uncle here, and told him all about it; but I didn't, and I'd made up my mind to send him the money back, only I met two or three mates, and I had to change one of 'em to give the poor lads a drink o' ale.\"  \"You own, then, that you had my money, sir?\" cried the old merchant.  \"Well--some on it, master.  He give it me.  S'pose I oughtn't to have took it, but I didn't like to come and tell you, and get the poor lad into trouble.  He's so young, you see.\"  \"Uncle, it is not true!\" cried Lindon, excitedly.  \"But you had one of the guineas in your pocket, sir.\"  \"Yes, uncle, but--\"  \"Course he had,\" interrupted Mike sharply.  \"I told you it wouldn't do, Master Don.  I begged you not to.\"  \"You villain!\" cried Don, grinding his teeth, while his uncle watched him with a sidelong look.  \"Calling names won't mend it, my lad.  I knowed it was wrong.  I"]]]
