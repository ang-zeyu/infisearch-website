I'm on my way in to see them now.\"  \"Hooray,\" said Wehling emptily.  \"You don't sound very happy,\" said Dr. Hitz.  \"What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?\" said Wehling. He gestured with his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. \"All I have to do is pick out which one of the triplets is going to live, then deliver my maternal grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a receipt.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. \"You don't believe in population control, Mr. Wehling?\" he said.  \"I think it's perfectly keen,\" said Wehling tautly.  \"Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of the Earth was twenty billion--about to become forty billion, then eighty billion, then one hundred and sixty billion? Do you know what a drupelet is, Mr. Wehling?\" said Hitz.  \"Nope,\" said Wehling sulkily.  \"A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little pulpy grains of a blackberry,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Without population control, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!\"  Wehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.  \"In the year 2000,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"before scientists stepped in and laid down the law, there wasn't even enough drinking water to go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weed--and still people insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to live forever.\"  \"I want those kids,\" said Wehling quietly. \"I want all three of them.\"  \"Of course you do,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"That's only human.\"  \"I don't want my grandfather to die, either,\" said Wehling.  \"Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,\" said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically.  \"I wish people wouldn't call it that,\" said Leora Duncan.  \"What?\" said Dr. Hitz.  \"I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like that,\" she said. \"It gives people the wrong impression.\"  \"You're absolutely right,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Forgive me.\" He corrected himself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official title, a title no one ever used in conversation. \"I should have said, 'Ethical Suicide Studios,'\" he said.  \"That sounds so much better,\" said Leora Duncan.  \"This child of yours--whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"He or she is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet, thanks to population control. In a garden like that mural there.\" He shook his head. \"Two centuries ago, when I was a young man, it was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now centuries of peace and plenty stretch before us as far as the imagination cares to travel.\"  He smiled luminously.  The smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver.  Wehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. \"There's room for one--a great big one,\" he said.  And then he shot Leora Duncan. \"It's only death,\" he said to her as she fell. \"There! Room for two.\"  And then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children.  Nobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.  The painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively on the sorry scene.         *       *       *       *       *  The painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born and, once born, demanding to be fruitful ... to multiply and to live as long as possible--to do all that on a very small planet that would have to last forever.  All the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer, surely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war. He thought of plague. He thought of starvation.  He knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to the dropcloths below. And then he decided he had had about enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the ladder.  He took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.  But he didn't have the nerve.  And then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"  \"Federal Bureau of Termination,\" said the very warm voice of a hostess.  \"How soon could I get an appointment?\" he asked, speaking very carefully.  \"We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,\" she said. \"It might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation.\"  \"All right,\" said the painter, \"fit me in, if you please.\" And he gave her his name, spelling it out.  \"Thank you, sir,\" said the hostess. \"Your city thanks you; your country thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is from future generations.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21280"],["title","Surgical Experiences in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net         [Illustration: FRONTISPIECE.

SURGEON TO ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL, LONDON JOINT LECTURER ON SURGERY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL MEMBER OF THE COURT OF EXAMINERS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND, AND LATE ONE OF THE CONSULTING SURGEONS TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN FIELD FORCE   LONDON SMITH, ELDER, & CO., 15 WATERLOO PLACE 1901     TO  SURGEON-GENERAL W. D. WILSON  PRINCIPAL MEDICAL OFFICER TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN FIELD FORCE  THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS EMPLOYED IN SOUTH AFRICA  AND TO THE  CIVIL SURGEONS TEMPORARILY ATTACHED TO THAT CORPS  These Experiences are Dedicated  AS AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION OF THE INVARIABLE KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY EXTENDED TO THE AUTHOR WITHOUT WHICH THE BOOK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN     PREFACE   A word of explanation is perhaps necessary as to the form in which these experiences have been put together. The matter was originally collected with the object of sending a series of articles to the _British Medical Journal_. Various circumstances, however, of which the chief was the feeling that extending experience altered in many cases the views adopted at first sight, prevented the original intention from being carried into execution, and the articles, considerably expanded, are now published together.  As to the illustrative cases introduced in support of various statements made in the text, only those have been chosen from my notes which were under my own observation for a considerable time, and many of these have been brought up to date since my return to England. I have, as a rule, avoided the inclusion of cases seen cursorily, and few simple ones have been quoted since their character is sufficiently indicated in the text. These remarks seem necessary since the mode of selection has resulted in the inclusion of a number of cases of exceptional severity, and any attempt to draw statistical conclusions from them would be most misleading.  The first two chapters have been added with a view to affording some information, first, as to the conditions under which a great part of the surgical work was done, and, secondly, as to the mechanism and causation of the injuries, which would not readily be at hand in the case of the general surgical reader. For much of the information contained in Chapter II. I must express my indebtedness to the work of MM. Nimier and Laval, so frequently quoted.  The only other object of this Preface is to express my thanks to the many who have aided me in the task of amplifying the observations on which the articles are founded, and I think no writer ever received more sympathetic and kindly help in such particulars than the author.  My first thanks, those due to the Members of the Royal Army Medical Corps, I endeavour to express by the dedication of this volume. Any attempt to make individual acknowledgment to either the Members of the Service, or to the Civil Surgeons temporarily attached, would be impossible. I have, however, tried to associate the names of many of those in charge of cases in the recital of histories and treatment throughout.  My thanks are not less due to the Military Heads of Departments at the War Office, who have helped me in the collection of details as to the subsequent course of many of the cases described, and in the acquisition of information regarding the weapons and ammunition treated of. I should particularly express my gratitude to Colonel Robb, of the Adjutant-General's Department, and Colonel Montgomery, of the Ordnance Department.  I am greatly indebted to my former colleague Mr. Cheatle for two of the illustrations of wounds, and for permission to quote some of his other experience, and to Mr. Henry Catling, to whose skill I owe the majority of the skiagrams of the fractures under my observation at Wynberg and elsewhere.  I must also express my thanks to Mr. Danielsson and his artist, Mr. Ford, for the trouble they have taken in converting my rough sketches into the illustrations contained in the volume.  Lastly, my warmest gratitude is due to my friends, Mr. Cuthbert Wallace, who has read some of my chapters, and to Mr. F. C. Abbott, who has read the whole book for the press and suggested many improvements and modifications.  47 CHARLES STREET, BERKELEY SQUARE, W.  _February_ 1901.
