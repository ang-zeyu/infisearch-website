Down the line, another van slammed open in back and a stream of crates swooped out, riding a gravity beam from the roof toward a waiting storeroom carrier. The guard closest to Trigger turned to watch the process. Trigger took six quick steps and reached her driver.  He put down a hand to help her step up. She slipped the five-crown piece into his palm.  \"Up front,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Next to the driver's seat and keep down. How far?\"  \"Nearest tube line.\"  He grinned again and nodded. \"Can do.\"  Twenty minutes later Trigger was in a downtown ComWeb booth. There had been a minor modification in her plans and she'd stopped off in a store a few doors away and picked up a carefully nondescript street dress and a scarf. She changed into the dress now and bundled the school costume into a deposit box, which she dispatched to Central Deposit with a one-crown piece, getting a numbered slip in return. It had occurred to her that there was a chance otherwise of getting caught in a Colonial School roundup, if it was brought to Doctor Plemponi's attention that there appeared to be considerably more students out on the town at the moment than could be properly overlooked.  Or even, Trigger thought, if somebody simply happened to have missed Trigger Argee.  She slipped the rain robe over her shoulders, dropped a coin into the ComWeb, and covered the silver-blonde hair with the scarf. The screen lit up. She asked for Grand Commerce Transportation.  Waiting, she realized suddenly that so far she was rather enjoying herself. There had been a little argument with the van driver who, it turned out, had ideas of his own about modifying Trigger's plans--a complication she'd run into frequently in her school days too. As usual, it didn't develop into a very serious argument. Truckers who dealt with the Colonial School knew, or learned in one or two briefly horrid lessons, that Mihul's commando-trained charges were prone to ungirlish methods of discouragement when argued with too urgently.  The view screen switched on. The transportation clerk's glance flicked over Trigger's street dress when she told him her destination. His expression remained bland. Yes, the Dawn City was leaving Ceyce Port for the Manon System tomorrow evening. Yes, it was subspace express--one of the newest and fastest, in fact. His eyes slipped over the dress again. Also one of the most luxurious, he might add. There would be only two three-hour stops in the Hub beyond Maccadon--one each off Evalee and Garth. Then a straight dive to Manon unless, of course, gravitic storm shifts forced the ship to surface temporarily. Average time for the Dawn City on the run was eleven days; the slowest trip so far had required sixteen.  \"But unfortunately, madam, there are only a very few cabins left--and not very desirable ones, I'm afraid.\" He looked apologetic. \"There hasn't been a vacancy on the Manon run for the past three months.\"  \"I can stand it, I imagine,\" Trigger said. \"How much for the cheapest?\"  The clerk cleared his throat gently and told her.  She couldn't help blinking, though she was braced for it. But it was more than she had counted on. A great deal more. It would leave her, in fact, with exactly one hundred and twenty-six crowns out of her entire savings, plus the coins she had in her purse.  \"Any extras?\" she asked, a little hoarsely.  He shrugged. \"There's Traveler's Rest,\" he said negligently. \"Nine hundred for the three dive periods. But Rest is optional, of course. Some passengers prefer the experience of staying awake during a subspace dive.\" He smiled--rather sadistically, Trigger felt--and added, \"Till they've lived through one of them, that is.\"  Trigger nodded. She'd lived through quite a few of them. She didn't like subspace particularly--nobody did--but except for an occasional touch of nausea or dizziness at the beginning of a dive, it didn't bother her much. Many people got hallucinations, went into states of panic or just got very sick. \"Anything else?\" she asked.  \"Just the usual tips and things,\" said the clerk. He looked surprised. \"Do you--does madam wish to make the reservation?\"  \"Madam does,\" Trigger told him coldly. \"How long will it hold?\"  It would be good up to an hour before take-off time, she learned. If not claimed then, it would be filled from the last-minute waiting list.  She left the booth thoughtfully. At least the Dawn City would be leaving in less than twenty-six hours. She wouldn't have to spend much of her remaining capital before she got off Maccadon.  She'd skip meals, she decided. Except breakfast next morning, which would be covered by her hotel room fee.  And it wasn't going to be any middle-class hotel.  There was no one obviously waiting for her at the Bank of Maccadon. In fact, since that venerable institution covered a city block, with entrances running up from the street level to the fifty-eighth floor, a small army would have been needed to make sure of spotting her.  She had to identify herself to get into the vaults, but there was a solution to that. Seven years ago when Runser Argee died suddenly and she had to get his property and records straightened out, a gray-haired little vault attendant with whom she dealt with had taken a fatherly interest in her. When she saw he was still on the job, Trigger was certain the matter would go off all right.  It did. He didn't take a really close look at her until she shoved her signature and Federation identification in front of him. Then his head bobbed up briskly. His eyes lit up.  \"Trigger!\" He bounced out of his chair. His right hand shot out. \"Good to see you again! I've been hearing about you.\"  They shook hands. She put a finger to her lips. \"I'm here incog!\" she cautioned in a low voice. \"Can you handle this quietly?\"  The faded blue eyes widened slightly, but he asked no questions. Trigger Argee's name was known rather widely, as a matter of fact, particularly on her home world. And as he remembered Trigger, she wasn't a girl who'd go look for a spotlight to stand in.  He nodded. \"Sure can!\" He glanced suspiciously at the nearest customers, then looked down at what Trigger had written. He frowned. \"You drawing out everything? Not leaving Ceyce for good, are you?\"  \"No,\" Trigger said. \"I'll be back. This is just a temporary emergency.\"  That was all the explaining she had to do. Four minutes later she had her money. Three minutes after that she had paid for the Dawn City reservation as Birna Drellgannoth and deposited her thumbprints with the ticket office. Counting what was left, she found it came to just under a hundred and thirty-eight.  Definitely no dinner tonight! She needed a suitcase and a change of clothing. And then she'd just better go sit in that hotel room.  The street level traffic was moderate around the bank, but it began to thicken as she approached a shopping center two blocks farther on. Striding along, neither hurrying nor idling, Trigger decided she had it made. The only real chance to catch up with her had been at the bank. And the old vault attendant wouldn't talk.  Half a block from the shopping center, a row of spacers on planet-leave came rollicking cheerily toward her, uniform jackets unbuttoned, three Ceyce girls in arm-linked formation among them, all happily high. Trigger shifted toward the edge of the sidewalk to let them pass. As the line swayed up on her left, there was a shadowy settling of an aircar at the curb to her right.  With loud outcries of glad recognition and whoops of laughter, the line swung in about her, close. Bodies crowded against her; a hand was clapped over her mouth. Other hands held her arms. Her feet came off the ground and she had a momentary awareness of being rushed expertly forward.  Then she was in the car, half on her side over the rear seat, two very strong hands clamping her wrists together behind her back. As she sucked in her breath for a yell, the door snapped shut behind her, cutting off the rollicking \"ha-ha-ha's\" and other noises outside.  There was a lurching twist as the aircar shot upward.      5   The man who held Trigger's wrists shifted his grip up her arms, and turned her a little so that she could sit upright on the seat, faced half away from him. She had got only a glimpse of him as he caught her, but he seemed to be wearing the same kind of commercial spacer's uniform as the group which had hustled her into the car. The other man in the car, the driver, sat up front with his back to them. He looked like any ordinary middle-aged civilian.  Trigger let her breath out slowly. There was no point in yelling now. She could feel her legs tremble a little, but she didn't seem to be actually frightened. At least, not yet.  \"Spot anything so far?\" the man who held her asked. It was a deep voice. It sounded matter-of-fact, quite unexcited.  \"Three possibles anyway,\" the driver said with equal casualness. He didn't turn his head. \"Make it two.... One very definite possible now, I'd say!\"  \"Better feed it to her then.\"  The driver didn't reply, but the car's renewed surge of power pushed Trigger down hard on the seat. She couldn't see much more than a shifting piece of the sky line through the front view plate. Their own car seemed to be rising at a tremendous rate. They were probably, she thought, already above the main traffic arteries over Ceyce.  \"Now, Miss Argee,\" the man sitting beside her said, \"I'd like to reassure you a little first.\"  \"Go ahead and reassure me,\" Trigger said unsteadily.  \"You're in no slightest danger from us,\" he said. \"We're your friends.\"  \"Nice friends!\" remarked Trigger.  \"I'll explain it all in a couple of minutes. There may be some fairly dangerous characters on our tail at the moment, and if they start to catch up--\"  \"Which they seem to be doing,\" the driver interrupted. \"Hang on for a few fast turns when we hit the next cloud bank.\"  \"We'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21510"],["title","Legacy (#7)"],["body","shake them there,\" the other man explained to Trigger. \"In case we don't though, I'll need both hands free to handle the guns.\"  \"So?\" she asked.  \"So I'd like to slip a set of cuffs on you for just a few minutes. I've been informed you're a fairly tricky lady, and we don't want you to do anything thoughtless. You won't have them on very long. All right?\"  Trigger bit her lip. It wasn't all right, and she didn't feel at all reassured so far.  \"Go ahead,\" she said.  He let go of her left arm, presumably to reach for the handcuffs. She twisted around on him and went into fast action.  She was fairly proficient at the practice of unarmed mayhem. The trouble was that the big ape she was trying the stuff on seemed at least as adept and with twice her muscle. She lost a precious instant finding out that the Denton was no longer in her robe pocket. After that she never got back the initiative. It didn't help either that the car suddenly seemed to be trying to fly in three directions at once.  All in all, about forty seconds passed before she was plumped back on the seat, her hands behind her again, linked at the wrists by the smooth plastic cords of the cuffs. The ape stood behind the driver, his hands resting on the back of the seat. He wasn't, Trigger observed bitterly, even breathing hard. The view plate was full of the cottony whiteness of a cloud heart. They seemed to be dropping again.  One more violent swerve and they came flashing out into wet gray cloud-shadow and on into brilliant sunlight.  A few seconds passed. Then the ape remarked, \"Looks like you lost them, chum.\"  \"Right,\" said the driver. \"Almost at the river now. I'll turn north there and drop down.\"  \"Right,\" said the ape. \"Get us that far and we'll be out of trouble.\"  A few minutes passed in silence. Presently Trigger sensed they were slowing and losing altitude. Then a line of trees flashed by in the view plate. \"Nice flying!\" the ape said. He punched the driver approvingly in the shoulder and turned back to Trigger.  They looked at each other for a few seconds. He was tall, dark-eyed, very deeply tanned, with thick sloping shoulders. He probably wasn't more than five or six years older than she was. He was studying her curiously, and his eyes were remarkably steady. Something stirred in her for a moment, a small chill of fear. Something passed through her thoughts, a vague odd impression, like a half aroused memory, of huge, cold, dangerous things far away. It was gone before she could grasp it more clearly. She frowned.  The ape smiled. It wasn't, Trigger saw, an entirely unpleasant face. \"Sorry the party got rough,\" he said. \"Will you give parole if I take those cuffs off and tell you what this is about?\"  She studied him again. \"Better tell me first,\" she said shortly.  \"All right. We're taking you to Commissioner Tate. We'll be there in about an hour. He'll tell you himself why he wanted to see you.\"  Trigger's eyes narrowed for an instant. Secretly she felt very much relieved. Holati Tate, at any rate, wouldn't let anything really unpleasant happen to her--and she would find out at last what had been going on.  \"You've got an odd way of taking people places,\" she observed.  He laughed. \"The grabber party wasn't scheduled. You'd indicated you wanted to speak to the Commissioner. We were sent to the Colonial School to pick you up and escort you to him. When we found out you'd disappeared, we had to do some fast improvising. Not my business to tell you the reasons for that.\"  Trigger said hesitantly, \"Those people who were chasing this car--\"  \"What about them?\" he asked thoughtfully.  \"Were they after _me_?\"  \"Well,\" he said, \"they weren't after me. Better let the Commissioner tell you about that, too. Now--how about parole?\"  She nodded. \"Till you turn me over to the Commissioner.\"  \"Fair enough,\" he said. \"You're his problem then.\" He took a small flat piece of metal out of a pocket and reached back of her with it. He didn't seem to do more than touch the cuffs, but she felt the slick coils loosen and drop away.  Trigger rubbed her wrists. \"Where's my gun?\" she asked.  \"I've got it. I'll give it to the Commissioner.\"  \"How did you people find me so fast?\"  \"Police keep bank entrances under twenty-four hour visual survey. We had someone watching their screens. You were spotted going in.\" He sat down companionably beside her. \"I'd introduce myself, but I don't know if that would fit in with the Commissioner's plans.\"  Trigger shrugged. It still was quite possible, she decided, that her own plans weren't completely spoiled. Holati and his friends didn't necessarily know about that vault account. If they did know she'd had one and had closed it out, they could make a pretty good guess at what she'd done with the money. But if she just kept quiet, there might be an opportunity to get back to Ceyce and the Dawn City by tomorrow evening.  \"Cigarette?\" the Commissioner's overmuscled henchman inquired amiably.  Trigger glanced at him from the side. Not amiably. \"No, thanks.\"  \"No hard feelings, are there?\" He looked surprised.  \"Yes,\" she said evenly. \"There are.\"  \"Maybe,\" the driver suggested from the front, \"what Miss Argee could do with is a shot of Puya. Flask's in my coat pocket. Left side.\"  \"There's an idea,\" remarked Trigger's companion. He looked at her. \"It's very good Puya.\"  \"So choke on it,\" Trigger told him gently. She settled back into the corner of the seat and closed her eyes. \"You can wake me up when we get to the Commissioner.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"In some way,\" Holati Tate said, \"this little item here seems to be at the core of the whole plasmoid problem. Know what it is?\"  Trigger looked at the little item with some revulsion. Dark green, marbled with pink streakings, it lay on the table between them, rather like a plump leech a foot and a half long. It was motionless except that the end nearest her shifted in a short arc from side to side, as if the thing suffered from a very slow twitch.  \"One of the plasmoids obviously,\" she said. \"A jumpy one.\" She blinked at it. \"Looks like that 113. Is it?\"  She glanced around. Commissioner Tate and Professor Mantelish, who sat in an armchair off to her right, were staring at her, eyebrows up, apparently surprised about something. \"What's the matter?\" she asked.  \"We're just wondering,\" said Holati, \"how you happen to remember 113, in particular, out of the thousands of plasmoids on Harvest Moon.\"  \"Oh. One of the Junior Scientists on your Project mentioned the 112-113 unit. That brought it to mind. Is this 113?\"  \"No,\" said Holati Tate. \"But it appears to be a duplicate of it.\" He was a mild-looking little man, well along in years, sparse and spruce in his Precol uniform. The small gray eyes in the sun-darkened, leathery face weren't really mild, if you considered them more closely, or if you knew the Commissioner.  \"Have to fill you in on some of the background first, Trigger girl,\" he'd said, when she was brought to his little private office and inquired with some heat what the devil was up. The tall grabber hadn't come into the office with her. He asked the Commissioner from the door whether he should get Professor Mantelish to the conference room, and the Commissioner nodded. Then the door closed and the two of them were alone.  \"I know it's looked odd,\" Commissioner Tate admitted, \"but the circumstances have been very odd. Still are. And I didn't want to worry you any more than I had to.\"  Trigger, unmollified, pointed out that the methods he'd used not to worry her hardly had been soothing.  \"I know that, too,\" said the Commissioner. \"But if I'd told you everything immediately, you would have had reason enough to be worried for the past two months, rather than just for a day or so. The situation has improved now, very considerably. In fact, in another few days you shouldn't have any more reason to worry at all.\" He smiled briefly. \"At least, no more than the rest of us.\"  Trigger felt a bit dry-lipped suddenly. \"I do at present?\" she asked.  \"You did till today. There's been some pretty heavy heat on you, Trigger girl. We're switching most of it off tonight. For good, I think.\"  \"You mean some heat will be left?\"  \"In a way,\" he said. \"But that should be cleared up too in the next three or four days. Anyway we can drop most of the mystery act tonight.\"  Trigger shook her head. \"It isn't being dropped very fast!\" she observed.  \"I told you I couldn't tell it backwards,\" the Commissioner said patiently. \"All right if we start filling in the background now?\"  \"I guess we'd better,\" she admitted.  \"Fine,\" said Commissioner Tate. He got to his feet. \"Then let's go join Mantelish.\"  \"Why the professor?\"  \"He could help a lot with the explaining. If he's in the mood. Anyway he's got a kind of pet I'd like you to look at.\"  \"A pet!\" cried Trigger. She shook her head again and stood up resignedly. \"Lead on, Commissioner!\"  They joined Mantelish and his plasmoid weirdie in what looked like the dining room of what had looked like an old-fashioned hunting lodge when the aircar came diving down on it between two ice-sheeted mountain peaks. Trigger wasn't sure in just what section of the main continent they were; but there were only two or three alternatives--it was high in the mountains, and night came a lot faster here than it did around Ceyce.  She greeted Mantelish and sat down at the table. Then the Commissioner locked the doors and introduced her to the professor's pet.  \"It's labelled 113-A,\" he said now. \"Even the professor isn't certain he could distinguish between the two. Right, Mantelish?\"  \"That is true,\" said Mantelish, \"at present.\" He was a very big, rather fat but healthy-looking old man with a thick thatch of white hair and a ruddy face. \"Without a physical comparison--\" He shrugged.  \"What's so important about the critter?\" Trigger asked, eyeing the leech again. One good thing about it, she thought--it wasn't equipped to eye her back.  \"It goes"]]]
