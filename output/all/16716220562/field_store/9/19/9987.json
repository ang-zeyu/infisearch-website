I will make a man       of you.”                  “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their       jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.       Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by       eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the       company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately       and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”                  “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was       growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.            His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but       effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the       epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized       world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently       beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to       nature was thus thought to be secured.            The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet       shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of       the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion       was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by       ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang       was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of       the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long       chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,       _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then       about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining       arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each       other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear       natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at       right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the       present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in       Borneo.            The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular       room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single       window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially       designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending       by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by       means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)       this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.            The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;       but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer       judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this       occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in       weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been       seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account       of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from       out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional       sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a       flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the       Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or       sixty altogether.            The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until       midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before       making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,       than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the       impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to       stumble as they entered.            The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart       of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of       the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of       some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women       swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to       exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated       their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the       doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his       entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with       him.            While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to       his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure       of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,       and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very       gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of       the floor.            Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the       hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,       of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus       situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting       them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the       intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically       and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the       hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an       instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far       upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable       consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and       face to face.            The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their       alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived       pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the       apes.            “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself       easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.       If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”                  Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the       wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,       as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a       monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the       chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and       still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”                  And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with       laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain       flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the       dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in       mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the       chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the       eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to       thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who       they were.            So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead       silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such       a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the       king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of       Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to       whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the       dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and       glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned       countenances of the king and his seven companions.            “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see       who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more       closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and       which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a       minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the       shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,       and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.            At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester       to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made       this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.       The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:            “I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.       They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who       does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors       who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the       jester—and this is my last jest.”                  Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it       adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the       work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a       fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled       his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared       through the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 5 (#6)"],["body","sky-light.            It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had       been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,       together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was       seen again.     THE MAN OF THE CROWD.   Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.             It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht       lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some       secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in       their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them       piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of       throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer       themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes       up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the       grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.            Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the       large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some       months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with       returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so       precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest       appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the       αχλυξ η πριυ       επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,       surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet       candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely       to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many       of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest       in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had       been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring       over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the       room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.            This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had       been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,       the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well       lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past       the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been       in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,       therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all       care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of       the scene without.            At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked       at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate       relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute       interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,       and expression of countenance.            By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied       business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way       through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;       when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of       impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a       numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and       talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on       account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their       progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their       gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the       lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed       profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There       was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I       have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly       termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,       tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of       society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their       own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not       greatly excite my attention.            The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable       divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young       gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and       supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which       may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these       persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection       of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off       graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best       definition of the class.            The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old       fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats       and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white       cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or       gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right       ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I       observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,       and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient       pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed       there be an affectation so honorable.            There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily       understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all       great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much       inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be       mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of       wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.            The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily       recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the       desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,       gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate       clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still       all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a       filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two       other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded       lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of       the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in       company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat       different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be       defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon       the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the       military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and       smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.            Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and       deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing       from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of       abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon       mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the       night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed       a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every       one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,       some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a       cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the       glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;       women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal       beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in       Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with       filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the       wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at       youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,       an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid       ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards       innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,       inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole       although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual       lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials       which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well       brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy       step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously       wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode       through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside       these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,       monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who       sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all       full of a noisy and"]]]
