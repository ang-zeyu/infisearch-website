Without these asterisks and, other omissions, nothing would have been easier than to expand these three volumes into a hundred. I think nothing relevant is lost. Nobody ever had fewer secrets, nobody ever lived and wrought in fuller sunlight.                                  CHAPTER I                                CHILDHOOD                              (_1809-1821_)       I know not why commerce in England should not have its old      families, rejoicing to be connected with commerce from generation      to generation. It has been so in other countries; I trust it will      be so in this country.--GLADSTONE.   The dawn of the life of the great and famous man who is our subject in these memoirs has been depicted with homely simplicity by his own hand. With this fragment of a record it is perhaps best for me to begin our journey. 'I was born,' he says, 'on December 29, 1809,' at 62 Rodney Street, Liverpool. 'I was baptized, I believe, in the parish church of St. Peter. My godmother was my elder sister Anne, then just seven years old, who died a perfect saint in the beginning of the year 1829. In her later years she lived in close relations with me, and I must have been much worse but for her. Of my godfathers, one was a Scotch episcopalian, Mr. Fraser of ----, whom I hardly ever saw or heard of; the other a presbyterian, Mr. G. Grant, a junior partner of my father's.' The child was named William Ewart, after his father's friend, an immigrant Scot and a merchant like himself, and father of a younger William Ewart, who became member for Liverpool, and did good public service in parliament.       Before proceeding to the period of my childhood, properly      so-called, I will here insert a few words about my family. My      maternal grandfather was known as Provost Robertson of Dingwall, a      man held, I believe, in the highest respect. His wife was a      Mackenzie of [Coul]. His circumstances must have been good.       Of his three sons, one went into the army, and I recollect him as      Captain Robertson (I have a seal which he gave me, a three-sided      cairngorm. Cost him 7½ guineas). The other two took mercantile      positions. When my parents made a Scotch tour in 1820-21 with, I      think, their four sons, the freedom of Dingwall was presented to us      all,[1] with my father; and there was large visiting at the houses      of the Ross-shire gentry. I think the line of my grandmother was      stoutly episcopalian and Jacobite; but, coming outside the western      highlands, the first at least was soon rubbed down. The provost, I      think, came from a younger branch of the Robertsons of Struan.       On my father's side the matter is more complex. The history of the      family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my      own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has      carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth,      but has not yet been able to connect us with the earliest known      holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes      to do. Some things are plain and not without interest. They were a      race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone      castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century.      The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the      crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service      like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case      passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in      Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of      family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined      by public authority, but not for any ordinary criminal offence.      From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During      the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a      line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire.      Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar.      I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of      that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small      watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my      father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the      family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem      to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in      Yorkshire.[3]                                    ANCESTRY       My father's father seems from his letters to have been an excellent      man and a wise parent: his wife a woman of energy. There are      pictures of them at Fasque, by Raeburn. He was a merchant, in      Scotch phrase; that is to say, a shopkeeper dealing in corn and      stores, and my father as a lad served in his shop. But he also sent      a ship or ships to the Baltic; and I believe that my father, whose      energy soon began to outtop that of all the very large family, went      in one of these ships at a very early age as a supercargo, an      appointment then, I think, common. But he soon quitted a nest too      small to hold him. He was born in December 1764: and I have (at      Hawarden) a reprint of the _Liverpool Directory_ for 178-, in which      his name appears as a partner in the firm of Messrs. Corrie, corn      merchants.       Here his force soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a      foremost member of the community. A liberal in the early period of      the century, he drew to Mr. Canning, and brought that statesman as      candidate to Liverpool in 1812, by personally offering to guarantee      his expenses at a time when, though prosperous, he could hardly      have been a rich man. His services to the town were testified by      gifts of plate, now in the possession of the elder lines of his      descendants, and by a remarkable subscription of six thousand      pounds raised to enable him to contest the borough of Lancaster,      for which he sat in the parliament of 1818.       At his demise, in December 1851, the value of his estate was, I      think, near £600,000. My father was a successful merchant, but      considering his long life and means of accumulation, the result      represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others      whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed. It was a large      and strong nature, simple though hasty, profoundly affectionate and      capable of the highest devotion in the lines of duty and of love. I      think that his intellect was a little intemperate, though not his      character. In his old age, spent mainly in retirement, he was our      constant [centre of] social and domestic life. My mother, a      beautiful and admirable woman, failed in health and left him a      widower in 1835, when she was 62.  He then turns to the records of his own childhood, a period that he regarded as closing in September 1821, when he was sent to Eton. He begins with one or two juvenile performances, in no way differing from those of any other infant,--_navita projectus humi_, the mariner flung by force of the waves naked and helpless ashore. He believes that he was strong and healthy, and came well through his childish ailments.       My next recollection belongs to the period of Mr. Canning's first      election for Liverpool, in the month of October of the year 1812.      Much entertaining went on in my father's house, where Mr. Canning      himself was a guest; and on a day of a great dinner I was taken      down to the dining room. I was set upon one of the chairs,      standing, and directed to say to the company 'Ladies and      gentlemen.'       I have, thirdly, a group of recollections which refer to Scotland.      Thither my father and mother took me on a journey which they made,      I think, in a post-chaise to Edinburgh and Glasgow as its principal      points. At Edinburgh our sojourn was in the Royal Hotel, Princes      Street. I well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle      guns were fired on some great occasion, probably the abdication of      Napoleon, for the date of the journey was, I think, the spring of      1814.                              EARLY RECOLLECTIONS       In this journey the situation of Sanquhar, in a close Dumfriesshire      valley, impressed itself on my recollection. I never saw Sanquhar      again until in the autumn of 1863 (as I believe). As I was whirled      along the Glasgow and South-Western railway I witnessed just      beneath me lines of building in just such a valley, and said that      must be Sanquhar, which it was. My local memory has always been      good and very impressible by scenery. I seem to myself never to      have forgotten a scene.       I have one other early recollection to record. It must, I think,      have been in the year 1815 that my father and mother took me with      them on either one or two more journeys. The objective points were      Cambridge and London respectively. My father had built, under the      very niggard and discouraging laws which repressed rather than      encouraged the erection of new churches at that period, the church      of St. Thomas at Seaforth, and he wanted a clergyman for it.[4]      Guided in these matters very much by the deeply religious temper of      my mother, he went with her to Cambridge to obtain a recommendation      of a suitable person from Mr. Simeon, whom I saw at the time.[5] I      remember his appearance distinctly. He was a venerable man, and      although only a fellow of a college, was more ecclesiastically got      up than many a dean, or even here and there, perhaps, a bishop of      the present less costumed if more ritualistic period. Mr. Simeon, I      believe,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],["title","The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#3)"],["body","Mr. Jones, an excellent specimen of the      excellent evangelical school of those days. We went to Leicester to      hear him preach in a large church, and his text was '_Grow in      grace_.' He became eventually archdeacon of Liverpool, and died in      great honour a few years ago at much past 90. On the strength of      this visit to Cambridge I lately boasted there, even during the      lifetime of the aged Provost Okes, that I had been in the      university before any one of them.       I think it was at this time that in London we were domiciled in      Russell Square, in the house of a brother of my mother, Mr. Colin      Robertson; and I was vexed and put about by being forbidden to run      freely at my own will into and about the streets, as I had done in      Liverpool. But the main event was this: we went to a great service      of public thanksgiving at Saint Paul's, and sat in a small gallery      annexed to the choir, just over the place where was the Regent, and      looking down upon him from behind. I recollect nothing more of the      service, nor was I ever present at any public thanksgiving after      this in Saint Paul's, until the service held in that cathedral,      under my advice as the prime minister, after the highly dangerous      illness of the Prince of Wales.       Before quitting the subject of early recollections I must name one      which involves another person of some note. My mother took me in      181--to Barley Wood Cottage, near Bristol. Here lived Miss Hannah      More, with some of her coeval sisters. I am sure they loved my      mother, who was love-worthy indeed. And I cannot help here      deviating for a moment into the later portion of the story to      record that in 1833 I had the honour of breakfasting with Mr.      Wilberforce a few days before his death,[6] and when I entered the      house, immediately after the salutation, he said to me in his      silvery tones, 'How is your sweet mother?' He had been a guest in      my father's house some twelve years before. During the afternoon      visit at Barley Wood, Miss Hannah More took me aside and presented      to me a little book. It was a copy of her _Sacred Dramas_, and it      now remains in my possession, with my name written in it by her.      She very graciously accompanied it with a little speech, of which I      cannot recollect the conclusion (or apodosis), but it began, 'As      you have just come into the world, and I am just going out of it, I      therefore,' etc.      I wish that in reviewing my childhood I could regard it as     presenting those features of innocence and beauty which I have often     seen elsewhere, and indeed, thanks be to God, within the limits of     my own home. The best I can say for it is that I do not think it was     a vicious childhood. I do not think, trying to look at the past     impartially, that I had a strong natural propensity then developed     to what are termed the mortal sins. But truth obliges me to record     this against myself. I have no recollection of being a loving or a     winning child; or an earnest or diligent or knowledge-loving child.     God forgive me. And what pains and shames me most of all is to     remember that at most and at best I was, like the sailor in Juvenal,                              digitis a morte remotus,                      Quatuor aut septem;[7]      the plank between me and all the sins was so very thin. I do not     indeed intend in these notes to give a history of the inner life,     which I think has been with me extraordinarily dubious, vacillating,     and above all complex. I reserve them, perhaps, for a more private     and personal document; and I may in this way relieve myself from     some at least of the risks of falling into an odious Pharisaism. I     cannot in truth have been an interesting child, and the only     presumption the other way which I can gather from my review is that     there was probably something in me worth the seeing, or my father     and mother would not so much have singled me out to be taken with     them on their journeys.      I was not a devotional child. I have no recollection of early love     for the House of God and for divine service: though after my father     built the church at Seaforth in 1815, I remember cherishing a hope     that he would bequeath it to me, and that I might live in it. I have     a very early recollection of hearing preaching in St. George's,     Liverpool, but it is this: that I turned quickly to my mother and     said, 'When will he have done?' The _Pilgrim's Progress_ undoubtedly     took a great and fascinating hold upon me, so that anything which I     wrote was insensibly moulded in its style; but it was by the force     of the allegory addressing itself to the fancy, and was very like a     strong impression received from the _Arabian Nights_, and from     another work called _Tales of the Genii_. I think it was about the     same time that Miss Porter's _Scottish Chiefs_, and especially the     life and death of Wallace, used to make me weep profusely. This     would be when I was about ten years old. At a much earlier period,     say six or seven, I remember praying earnestly, but it was for no     higher object than to be spared from the loss of a tooth. Here,     however, it may be mentioned in mitigation that the local dentist     of those days, in our case a certain Dr. P. of ---- Street,     Liverpool, was a kind of savage at his work (possibly a very     good-natured man too), with no ideas except to smash and crash. My     religious recollections, then, are a sad blank. Neither was I a     popular boy, though not egregiously otherwise. If I was not a bad     boy, I think that I was a boy with a great absence of goodness. I     was a child of slow, in some points I think of singularly slow,     development. There was more in me perhaps than in the average boy,     but it required greatly more time to set itself in order: and just     so in adult, and in middle and later life, I acquired very tardily     any knowledge of the world, and that simultaneous conspectus of the     relations of persons and things which is necessary for the proper     performance of duties in the world.      I may mention another matter in extenuation. I received, unless my     memory deceives me, very little benefit from teaching. My father was     too much occupied, my mother's health was broken. We, the four     brothers, had no quarrelling among ourselves: but neither can I     recollect any influence flowing down at this time upon me, the     junior. One odd incident seems to show that I was meek, which I     should not have supposed, not less than thrifty and penurious, a     leaning which lay deep, I think, in my nature, and which has     required effort and battle to control it. It was this. By some     process not easy to explain I had, when I was _probably_ seven or     eight, and my elder brothers from ten or eleven to fourteen or     thereabouts, accumulated no less than twenty shillings in silver. My     brothers judged it right to appropriate this fund, and I do not     recollect either annoyance or resistance or complaint. But I     recollect that they employed the principal part of it in the     purchase of four knives, and that they broke the points from the     tops of the blades of my knife, lest I should cut my fingers.      Where was the official or appointed teacher all this time? He was     the Rev. Mr. Rawson of Cambridge, who had, I suppose, been passed by     Mr. Simeon and become private tutor in my father's house. But as he     was to be incumbent of the church, the bishop required a parsonage     and that he should live in it. Out of this grew a very small school     of about twelve boys, to which I went, with some senior brother or     brothers remaining for a while.       Mr. Rawson was a good man, of high no-popery opinions. His school      afterwards rose into considerable repute, and it had Dean Stanley      and the sons of one or more other Cheshire families for pupils. But      I think this was not so much due to its intellectual stamina as to      the extreme salubrity of the situation on the pure dry sands of the      Mersey's mouth, with all the advantages of the strong tidal action      and the fresh and frequent north-west winds. At five miles from      Liverpool Exchange, the sands, delicious for riding, were one      absolute solitude, and only one house looked down on them between      us and the town. To return to Mr. Rawson. Everything was      unobjectionable. I suppose I learnt something there. But I have no      recollection of being under any moral or personal influence      whatever, and I doubt whether the preaching had any adaptation      whatever to children. As to intellectual training, I believe that,      like the other boys, I shirked my work as much as I could. I went      to Eton in 1821 after a pretty long spell, in a very middling state      of preparation, and wholly without any knowledge or other      enthusiasm, unless it were a priggish love of argument which I had      begun to develop. I had lived upon a rabbit warren: and what a      rabbit warren of a life it is that I have been surveying.       My brother John, three years older than myself, and of a moral      character more manly and on a higher level, had chosen the navy,      and went off to the preparatory college at Portsmouth. But he      evidently underwent persecution for righteousness' sake at the      college, which was then (say about 1820) in a bad condition. Of      this, though he was never querulous, his letters bore the traces,      and I cannot but think they must have exercised upon me some kind      of influence for good. As to miscellaneous notices, I had a great      affinity with the trades of joiners and of bricklayers. Physically      I must have been rather tough, for my brother John took me down at      about ten "]]]
