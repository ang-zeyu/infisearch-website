Rhoda has been brought up as the child of rich parents. Her brothers have done well, but she has been kept at home, and has been taught by governesses and other visiting tutors.  The German fraulein goes to her own home in Germany for a holiday, where she gets married and never comes back.  This prompts Mr Chester to consider sending Rhoda away to a boarding school.  There is a discussion, Rhoda's mother not being at all in favour of the idea, but Rhoda is keen to go.  They settle on a school.  Rhoda goes there, and enjoys herself, doing well.  Tom and the other girls are of course her schoolmates.  But there is to be an important exam, for which Rhoda overworks, to the point where her brain  no longer works when she is in the examination hall. So life is downward, instead of upward, she realises.  We will leave you to read the rest of the story.  Vaizey is at her best again.  N.H. ________________________________________________________________________ TOM AND SOME OTHER GIRLS A PUBLIC SCHOOL STORY  BY MRS. GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY    CHAPTER ONE.  A CHANGE.  \"Yes, she must go to school!\" repeated Mr Chester.  A plaintive sob greeted his words from the neighbourhood of the sofa. For once in her life Mrs Chester's kindly, good-tempered face had lost its smiles, and was puckered up into lines of distress.  She let one fat, be-ringed hand drop to her side and wander restlessly over the satin skirt in search of a pocket.  Presently out came a handkerchief, which was applied to each eye in turn, and came away bedewed with tears.  \"It will break my heart to part from her!\" she faltered.  Her husband laughed with masculine scepticism.  \"Oh, nonsense, dear,\" he said; \"hearts are not so easily broken.  You are too sensible to grieve over what is for the child's good, and will get used to the separation, as other mothers have done before you.  It will be the making of Rhoda to leave home for a few years, to mix with other girls, and find her level.  She is getting an altogether exaggerated idea of her own importance!\"  \"Her level, indeed!  Find her level!  I should like to know the school where you could find another girl like her!\" cried the mother, in a tone which showed plainly enough who was responsible for Miss Rhoda's conceit.  The tears dried on her face for very indignation, and she sat upright in her seat, staring across the room.  It was a gorgeous apartment, this drawing-room of Erley Chase, the residence of Henry Chester, Esquire, and Marianne his wife; a gorgeous room in the literal acceptance of the term, for each separate article of furniture looked as if it had been chosen more from the fact of its intrinsic value than for its usefulness or beauty.  Mr Chester, the son of a country clergyman, had considered himself passing rich when a manufacturer uncle took him into his employ, at a salary of Â£400 a year.  The first thing he did after this position was assured was to marry his old love, the daughter of the village doctor, with whom he had played since childhood; and the young couple spent the first dozen years of their married lives very happily and contentedly in a little house in a smoky manufacturing town.  The bachelor uncle was proud of his clever nephew and fond of the cheery little wife, who was always kind and thoughtful even when gout and a naturally irritable temper goaded him into conduct the reverse of amiable.  When Harold was born, and christened after himself, he presented the child with a silver mug, and remarked that he hoped he would turn out better than most young men, and not break his parents' hearts as a return for their goodness. When Jim followed, the mug was not forthcoming; but when little Rhoda made her appearance six years later he gave her a rattle, and trusted that she would improve in looks as she grew older, since he never remembered seeing an uglier baby.  He was certainly neither a gracious nor a liberal old gentleman, but the young couple were blessed with contented minds and moderate ambitions, so they laughed good-naturedly at his crusty speeches, and considered themselves rich, inasmuch as they were able to pay their way and were spared anxiety for the future.  And then an extraordinary thing happened!  The old man died suddenly, and left to his beloved nephew a fortune which, even in these days of millionaires, might truthfully be called enormous.  Henry Chester could not believe the lawyers when the amount of his new wealth was broken to him, for his uncle had lived so unostentatiously that he had had no idea of the magnitude of his savings.  The little wife, who had never known what it was to spend sixpence carelessly in all her thirty-five years, grew quite hysterical with excitement when an arithmetical calculation proved to her the daily riches at her disposal; but she recovered her composure with wonderful celerity, and expressed her intention of enjoying the goods which the gods had sent her.  No poking in gloomy town houses after this!  No hoarding of riches as the poor old uncle had done, while denying himself the common comforts of life!  She herself had been economical from a sense of duty only, for her instincts were all for lavishness and generosity--and now, now!  Did not Henry feel it a provision of Providence that Erley Chase was empty, and, as it were, waiting for their occupation?  Her husband gasped at the audacity of the idea.  Erley Chase! the finest place around, one of the largest properties in the county, and Marianne suggested that he should take it! that he should remove from his fifty- pound house into that stately old pile!  The suggestion appalled him, and yet why not?  His lawyer assured him that he could afford it; his children were growing up, and he had their future to consider.  He thought of his handsome boys, his curly-headed girl, and decided proudly that nothing was too good for them; he looked into the future, and saw his children's children reigning in his stead, and the name of Chester honoured in the land.  So Erley Chase was bought, and little Mrs Chester furnished it, as we have seen, to her own great contentment and that of the tradespeople with whom she dealt; and in the course of a few months the family moved into their new abode.  At first the country people were inclined to look coldly on the new- comers, but it was impossible to keep up an unfriendly attitude towards Mr and Mrs Chester.  They were utterly free from affectation, and, so far from apeing that indifference to wealth adopted by most _nouveaux riches_, were so frankly, transparently enchanted with their new possessions that they were more like a couple of children with a new toy than a steady-going, middle-aged couple.  They won first respect, and then affection, and were felt to be a decided acquisition to the well- being of the neighbourhood, since they were never appealed to in vain in the cause of charity.  In the days of her own short means, when she had been obliged to look helplessly at the trials of her neighbours, Mrs Chester had solaced herself by dreaming of what she would do if she had money and to spare, and to her credit be it said, she did not forget to put those dreams into execution when the opportunity arose.  The days are past when fairy godmothers flash suddenly before our raptured eyes, clad in spangled robes, with real, true wings growing out of their shoulders, but the race is not dead; they appear sometimes as stout little women, in satin gowns and be-feathered bonnets, and with the most prosaic of red, beaming faces.  The Chester barouche was not manufactured out of a pumpkin, nor drawn by rats, but none the less had it spirited away many a Cinderella to the longed-for ball, and, when the Prince was found, the fairy godmother saw to it that there was no lack of satin gowns, or glassy slippers.  Dick Whittingtons, too, sitting friendless by the roadside, were helped on to fortune; and the Sleeping Beauty was rescued from her dull little home, and taken about to see the world.  It is wonderful what fairy deeds can be accomplished by a kind heart and a full purse, and the recipients of Mrs Chester's bounty were relieved from undue weight of obligation by the transparent evidence that her enjoyment was even greater than their own!  Harold went to Eton and Oxford, and Jim to Sandhurst; but Rhoda stayed at home and ruled supreme over her mother, her governesses, and the servants of the establishment.  Her great-uncle's wish had been fulfilled, inasmuch as she grew up tall and straight, with a mane of reddish-gold hair and more than an average share of good looks.  She was clever, too, and generous enough to have acknowledged her faults if it had for one moment occurred to her that she possessed any; which it had not.  It was one of Mrs Chester's articles of faith that her daughter was the most beautiful, the most gifted, and the most perfect of created beings, and Rhoda agreeably acquiesced in the decision, and was pitiful of other girls who were not as herself.  Every morning when she had not a headache, and did not feel \"floppy\" or \"nervey,\" she did lessons with Fraulein, who adored her, and shed tears behind her spectacles when obliged to point out a fault.  Then the two would repair together to the tennis courts and play a set, the pupil winning by six games to love; or go a bicycle ride, when Rhoda would practise fancy figures, while her good, but cumbersome, companion picked herself up from recumbent positions on the sidewalk, and shook the dust from her garments.  At other times Rhoda would put on her riding habit and go a ride round the estate, taking care to emerge from the west gate at the moment when the village children were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],["title","Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#1)"],["body","from school.  The little girls would \"bob\" in old-fashioned style, and the boys would pull off their caps, and Rhoda would toss her flaxen mane and acknowledge their salutations with a gracious smile and a wave of the little gloved hand.  The children thought she looked like a fairy princess, and no more dreamt that she was of the same flesh and blood as themselves than did Miss Rhoda herself.  Then came lunch, and more often than not some excuse for getting off the hour's lessons with Fraulein before the \"visiting professors\" arrived.  Music master, drawing master, French master--they each came in their turn, and Rhoda exerted herself to do her best, as she invariably did, given the stimulus of an audience, and was praised and flattered to her heart's desire.  It was a happy life, and most satisfactory from the girl's point of view; so that it seemed most annoying that it should be interrupted, and by Fraulein too, who had always been so meek and tractable!  Who could have imagined when she went home for the summer holidays that an old love would appear and insist upon marrying her out of hand?  \"But what am _I_ to do?\" cried Rhoda, when the news was first received; and then, in stern disapproval, \"I'm _surprised_ at Fraulein!  At her age she should know better.  She always professed to be so devoted.  I can't understand how she could make up her mind to leave me.\"  \"It must have been a terrible trial to her, dearest,\" said Mrs Chester soothingly, and she meant what she said.  How could any one prefer a fat, long-haired, spectacled lover (all Germans were fat, long-haired, and spectacled!) to her beautiful, clever daughter?  She sighed, once for Rhoda's disappointment, and once again, and with an added stab, for herself.  Several times lately Mr Chester had hinted that Rhoda was getting too much for Fraulein, and should be sent to school, while Harold had treacherously seconded his father with remarks of such brotherly candour as made his mother hot with indignation.  Jim was mercifully away from home, but even so it was two against one, and she instinctively felt that Fraulein's defection would be seized upon by the enemy and the attack pressed home upon the first opportunity.  And now it had come, and there sat the poor, dear soul, shedding tears of anguish on her lace-edged handkerchief, as she vainly tried to oppose the inevitable.  \"I cannot, and will not, part from my child!\"  \"Nonsense, mother, you parted from me, and I shall take it as a personal insult if you insinuate that you would feel Rhoda's absence more than you did mine.  Remember how delighted you were when I came back! Remember the holidays, how happy you were, how interested in all I had to tell!\"  Harold Chester crossed the room, and laid his hand on his mother's shoulder with a kindly gesture.  He looked as if he were made on the same principle as the other objects of _vertu_ in the room, and if Mrs Chester had desired to possess \"the most superfine specimen of sons and heirs,\" she had certainly got her wish, so far as appearances were concerned.  Harold was tall and fair, with aquiline features and a manly carriage.  His hair would have curled if it had not been cropped so close to his head; his clothes were of immaculate cut.  At twenty-five he was known as one of the most daring sportsmen in the county, and if he had not distinguished himself at college, he had, at least, scrambled through with the crowd.  His mother declared with pride that he had never given her an hour's anxiety since he had had the measles, and thanked Heaven for her mercies every time she saw him ride off to the hunt in his beautiful pink coat.  Harold was her first-born darling, but Rhoda was the baby, and she could not bring herself to believe that her baby was growing up.  \"The child will fret and break her heart.  I don't care about myself, but I will not have her made unhappy.  She has such a sensitive heart!\" She sobbed as she spoke, and Harold laughed.  \"You trust me, mater; Rhoda is as well able to take care of herself as any girl can be.  You will regret it all your life long if you keep her at home now.  School is what she needs, and school she must have, if she is to make a woman worth having.  She is a jolly little soul, and I'm proud of her; but her eyes are so taken up admiring Miss Rhoda Chester that she has no attention left for anything else.  Let her go, mother, and find out that there are other girls in the world beside herself!\"  \"But the other girls will b-b-bully her.  They will make fun of her and laugh at her little ways--\"  \"And a good--\" Harold checked himself and said cheerily: \"Rhoda won't let herself be bullied without knowing the reason why, mother.  Whatever faults she may have, no one can accuse her of lack of spirit.  I believe she would like to go.  She has very few girl friends, and would enjoy the new experience.\"  \"We will tell her about it, and see what she says,\" said Mr Chester; and at that very moment the door opened and Rhoda walked into the room.    CHAPTER TWO.  WHAT RHODA THOUGHT.  Father, mother, and brother looked at Rhoda, and felt a pardonable pride in her appearance.  Her white evening frock showed off the fair complexion and golden locks, and she carried herself with an erect, fearless mien which made a pleasant contrast to the stooping backs and shambling gait of most growing girls.  If she were not regularly pretty, her air of assurance forced onlookers to think her so, despite their better judgment, and there was about her a breezy atmosphere of health and youth.  She looked from one to the other of the watching faces, and smiled in a good-humoured, tolerant manner, which showed a dimple in the round cheek.  \"Hatching mischief!\" she cried, nodding her head sagely.  \"The way in which your voices ceased as I entered the room was highly suspicious. Never mind--I'll go to bed soon, and then you can talk at your ease.  It _is_ awkward when birthdays are drawing near! ...  Chain bracelets are very nice, with turquoises set here and there, and I rather like that new edition of Shakespeare with a lot of dear little books fitted into a case.  I don't object to brooches either, or ornaments for my room--\"  \"But, strange to say, we were not thinking of giving you anything!  We were talking of a much more serious consideration than a birthday.  We were talking of your Future Education,\" said Mr Chester, solemnly.  He spoke so impressively, and with such very large capitals to the last two words, that Rhoda was startled into attention, and turned her eyes upon him in wonder.  \"My--future--education?  Why, what do you--what am I going to do?\"  \"We have been considering the advisability of sending you to school. You are nearly sixteen, and have been educated at home all your life, and now that Fraulein cannot return I feel strongly that it would be for your good to spend a couple of years at school among girls of your own age.  Your mother naturally dreads the parting, and fears that you would be unhappy, but Harold thinks that you would enjoy the experience.  What is your own impression?  Do you dislike the idea, or feel inclined towards it?\"  Rhoda meditated, and her mother watched her with wistful eyes.  At the first mention of the word \"school\" the girl had started with surprise, and her eyes had looked wide and puzzled, but now as she stood deliberating, it was not dismay, but rather pleasure and excitement, that showed in her face.  The eyes gleamed complacently, the dimple dipped, the fair head tilted itself, and Rhoda said slowly--  \"I think I should--_like_ it!  It would be a--change!\"  Alas for Mrs Chester, and alas for every mother in that sharp moment when she realises that the nestling which she has been keeping so safe and warm is already beginning to find the nest too narrow for its ambitions, and is longing to fly away into the big, wide world!  Two salt tears splashed on to the satin gown, but no one saw them, for the girl was engrossed in her own feelings, while Mr Chester was saying brightly--  \"That's my brave girl!  I knew you would be no coward.\"  Harold watched his sister with mingled pity and amusement.  \"They'll take it out of her!  They'll take it out of her!  Poor little Ro!  Won't she hate it, and won't it do her good!\" he said to himself, shrewdly.  \"And, after the first, I shouldn't wonder if she became a prime favourite!\"  Rhoda seated herself on a crimson plush chair, and folded her hands on her knees, in an attitude of expectation.  She was an impetuous young person, and could brook no delay when once her interest was aroused. School having been mentioned as a possibility of the future, it became imperative to settle the matter off-hand.  Which school?  When?  Who would take her?  What would she have to buy? What were the rules?  When were the holidays?  How long would they be? Where would she spend them?--One question succeeded another in breathless succession, making Mr Chester smile with indulgent amusement.  \"My dear child, how can I tell?  So far it is only a suggestion. Nothing is settled.  We have not even thought of one school before another--\"  \"If she goes at all, I should like her to go to Miss Moorby's, at Bournemouth,\" said Mrs Chester quickly.  \"She only takes ten girls, and I'm told it is just like a home--hot bottles in all the beds, and beef- tea at eleven--\"  \"Mother!\" cried Rhoda, in a tone of deep reproach.  Her eyes flashed, and she drew herself up proudly.  \"No, indeed!  If I go at all, I will do the thing properly, and go to a real school, and not a hot-house.  I don't want their old beef-tea and bottles.  I want to go to a nice, big, sporty school, where they treat you like boys, and not young ladies, and put you on your honour, and don't bind you down by a hundred sickening little rules.  I want to go to,\"--she drew a long breath, and glanced at her mother, as if bracing herself to meet opposition--\"to Hurst Manor! There!  I've read about it in magazines, and"]]]
