He therefore resumed his journey on the 12th, and in the afternoon reached the neighbourhood of Kabba.  As he approached, one of several people who were standing at the gate ran towards him and, taking his horse by the bridle, led him round the walls of the town and, pointing to the west, told him to go along or it would be the worse for him.  He in vain represented the danger of being benighted in the woods, exposed to the inclemency of the weather and the fury of wild beasts.  \"Go along,\" was the only answer he received.  He found that these negroes had acted thus from kindness, as the king's messengers who had come to seize him were inside the town.  Being repulsed from another village, he went on till he reached a small one somewhat out of the road, and sat down under a tree by a well.  Two or three women came to draw water and, perceiving the stranger, enquired where he was going.  On Park telling them to Sego, one of them went in to acquaint the _dooty_.  In a little time the _dooty_ sent for him, and permitted him to sleep in a large hut.  Next day he again set forward, meeting with the same inhospitable treatment as before, and having for three days to subsist on uncooked corn.  He was repulsed in like manner from the gates of Taffara; and at the village of Sooha, which he reached next day, he in vain endeavoured to procure some corn from the _dooty_, who was sitting by the gate. While Park was speaking to the old man, he called to a slave to bring his paddle along with him, and when he brought it, told him to dig a hole in the ground, pointing to a spot at no great distance.  While the slave was thus engaged, the _dooty_ kept muttering the words--\"Good-for-nothing!  A real plague!\"  These expressions, coupled with the appearance of the pit the lad had dug, which looked much like a grave, made Park think it prudent to decamp.  He had just mounted his horse, when the slave who had gone into the village returned, dragging the corpse of a boy by a leg and arm, which he threw into the pit with savage indifference, and at once began to cover it up with earth.  At sunset Park reached Koohkorro, a considerable town, and the great market for salt.  Here he was received into the house of a Bambarran who, once a slave to a Moor, had obtained his freedom and was now a merchant.  Finding that his guest was a Christian, he immediately desired him to write a _saphie_, saying that he would dress him a supper of rice if he would produce one to protect him from wicked men.  Park therefore covered the board on both sides, when his landlord, wishing to have the full force of the charm, washed the writing from the board into a calabash with a little water and, having said a few prayers over it, drank the whole draught; after which, lest a single word should escape, he licked the board until it was quite dry.  The _dooty_ of the place next sent to have a _saphie_ written--a charm to procure wealth.  So highly satisfied was he with his bargain that he presented the traveller with some meal and milk, and promised him in the morning some more milk for his breakfast.  When Park had finished his supper of rice and salt, he lay down upon a bullock's hide and slept quietly until morning, this being the first good meal and refreshing sleep he had enjoyed for a long time.  After leaving this place, having been misdirected as to his road, he reached a deep creek.  Rather than turn back, he went behind his horse and pushed him headlong into the water; then, taking the bridle in his teeth, he swam to the other side.  This was the third creek he had crossed in this manner since he had left Sego.  His clothes were, indeed, constantly wet from the rain and dew; and the roads being very deep and full of mud, such a washing was sometimes pleasant.  At Bammakoo, which he reached on the evening of the next day, he was received into the house of a negro merchant, of whom there are many wealthy ones in the place, trading chiefly in salt.  He was feasted also by a number of Moors, who spoke good Mandingo, and were more civil to him than their countrymen had before been.  One of them had travelled to Rio Grande, and spoke highly of the Christians.  From this man he received a present of boiled rice and milk.  He also met a slave merchant who had resided some years on the Gambia, who informed him about the places which lay in his intended course to the westward.  He was told that the road was impassable at this season of the year, and that there was a rapid river to cross.  Having, however, no money to maintain himself, Park determined at all risks to push on, and, having obtained a singing man who said he knew the road over the hills, set off the next day.  His musical conductor, however, lost the right path and, when among the hills, leaping to the top of a rock as if to look out for the road, suddenly disappeared.  Park managed, however, just before sunset, to reach the romantic village of Koomah, the sole property of a Mandingo merchant and surrounded by a high wall.  Though seldom visited by strangers, whenever the weary traveller did come to his residence the merchant made him welcome.  Park was soon surrounded by the harmless villagers, who had numberless questions to ask and in return for the information he gave them brought corn and milk for himself and grass for his horse, and kindled a fire in the hut where he was to sleep.  Accompanied by two shepherds as guides, he set out the next day from Koomah.  The shepherds, however, walked on ahead, troubling themselves but little about him.  The country was very rough, and the declivity so great that a false step would have caused him and his horse to be dashed to pieces.  As he was riding on, the shepherds being about a quarter of a mile before him, he heard a loud screaming as from a person in great distress.  Supposing that a lion had taken off one of the shepherds, he hurried on to ascertain what had happened.  The noise had ceased, and in a short time he perceived one of the shepherds lying among the long grass near the road, and concluded that the man was dead; but when he came close to him the shepherd whispered to him to stop, telling him that a party of armed men had seized upon his companion and shot two arrows at him.  While considering what to do, he saw at a little distance a man sitting upon the stem of a tree, and also the heads of six or seven more who were crouching down among the grass, with muskets in their hands.  It being impossible to escape, he rode forward towards them, hoping that they were elephant hunters.  By way of opening the conversation he inquired if they had shot anything; but in answer one of them ordered him to dismount, and then, as if recollecting himself, waved with his hand as a sign that Park might proceed.  He had ridden some way when they shouted to him again to stop, and told him that the King of the Foulahs had sent them to carry him to Fooladoo.  Without hesitating, Park turned and followed them.  They had reached a dark part of the wood when one of them observed in the Mandingo language, \"This place will do,\" and immediately snatched his hat from his head.  Feeling that resistance was useless, he allowed them to proceed till they had stripped him quite naked.  While they were examining their plunder, Park begged them to return his pocket compass; but, on his pointing to it as it lay on the ground, one of the banditti cocked his musket, swearing that he would shoot him if he presumed to take it.  After this some of them went away with his horse, and the remainder stood considering whether they should leave him quite naked or allow him something to shelter him from the sun.  Humanity at last prevailed, and they returned the worst of his two shirts and a pair of trousers; one of them also threw back his hat, in the crown of which he kept his memorandums--probably the reason why they did not wish to keep it.  Here he was in the midst of a vast wilderness in the depth of the rainy season, naked and alone, and surrounded by savage animals and men still more savage, five hundred miles from the nearest European settlement. His spirits began to fail, but he reflected that no human prudence could possibly have averted his present sufferings, and that, though a stranger in a strange land, he was still under the protecting eye of that Providence who has condescended to call Himself the stranger's friend.  At this moment the extreme beauty of a small moss in fructification caught his eye.  Though the whole plant was not much larger than the top of one of his fingers, he could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsules without admiration.  \"Can that Being,\" he thought, \"who brought this plant to perfection look with unconcern upon the situation and sufferings of creatures formed after his own image?  Surely not.\"  He started up and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forward, assured that relief was at hand.  In a short time he overtook the two shepherds who had come with him from Koomah.  They were greatly surprised to see him, observing that they never doubted that the Foulahs had murdered him.  In their company he arrived at Sibidooloo, the frontier town of the kingdom of Manding.  The chief man in the place, called Mansa, received him most kindly, and when Park related how he had been robbed of his horse and apparel, he observed, with an indignant air, \"Sit down.  You shall have everything restored to you--I have sworn it.\"  He at once gave directions to his people to search for the robbers.  Park was conducted into a hut, where he was provided with food, and a crowd of people assembled, all of whom commiserated his misfortunes and vented imprecations against the Foulahs.  As there was a great scarcity of provisions in the place, Park, after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],["title","Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#7)"],["body"," two days there, begged Mansa to allow him to depart.  He gave him permission to do so, provided he would remain at a town called Wanda for a few days, until he received some account of his horse and goods.  He took his departure accordingly on the morning of the 28th, and reached Wanda about noon of the 30th.  The head man of the place, who was a Mahommedan, acted not only as chief magistrate, but as schoolmaster.  He kept his school in an open shed, where the traveller was desired to take up his lodgings.  Park was very anxious for his clothes, as those he had on were completely worn-out, his shirt being like a piece of muslin and dirty in the extreme.  He here spent nine days suffering much from fever.  On the 6th two people arrived from Sibidooloo, bringing his horse and clothes, but his pocket compass, greatly to his vexation, was broken to pieces.  Every day he observed several women come to the house to receive a certain quantity of corn.  Knowing how valuable this article was at the present juncture, he enquired of his host whether he maintained these poor women from pure bounty or expected a return when the harvest should be gathered in.  \"Observe that boy,\" said he, pointing to a fine child about five years of age.  \"His mother has sold him to me for forty days' provisions for herself and the rest of her family.  I have bought another boy in the same manner.\"  Sick as he was, Park thought it necessary to take his leave of his hospitable landlord, to whom he presented his horse as the only recompense he could make, desiring him to convey his saddle and bridle as a present to Mansa of Sibidooloo.  As he was about to set out, his host begged him to accept his spear as a token of remembrance and a leather bag to contain his clothes.  Having converted his half-boots into sandals, he travelled with more ease.  Although the people were suffering great distress from the failure of the crops, he was in general most hospitably treated.  His landlord at Kinyeto, observing that he had hurt his ankle, insisted on his remaining several days till he could walk with the help of a staff.  Notwithstanding suffering from fever and exposed to constant rain, he continued his journey, narrowly escaping being detained at the town of Mansia by the inhospitable chief, who insisted on being paid for the small amount of food he had provided.  On September 16th he reached the town of Kamalia.  He was here conducted to the house of a Bushreen, Kafa Taura.  He was collecting a caravan of slaves to convey to the European settlements on the Gambia, as soon as the rains should be over.  He found Kafa seated in his house surrounded by several _slatees_ who proposed joining the caravan.  He was reading to them from an Arabic book, and enquired if his guest understood it. On being answered in the negative, he desired one of the _slatees_ to fetch a curious little book which had been brought from the west country.  It proved to be a book of Common Prayer, and Kafa expressed great joy on hearing that Park could read it, for some of the _slatees_, observing the colour of his skin, now become yellow from sickness, suspected that he was an Arab in disguise.  Kafa, however, had now no doubt concerning him, and kindly promised him every assistance in his power.  Park was here laid up completely by fever, but Kafa, who had provided a quiet hut for his accomodation, advised him to remain within it, assuring him that if he did not walk out in the wet he would soon be well.  He passed five weeks in a gloomy and solitary manner, seldom visited by any person except his benevolent landlord, who came daily to enquire about his health.  When the rains became less frequent the country began to grow dry and the fever left him, but in so debilitated condition that it was with difficulty he could crawl with his mat to the shade of a tamarind tree at a short distance, there to enjoy the refreshing smell of the corn-fields.  The benevolent and simple manners of the negroes, and the perusal of Kafa's little volume greatly contributed to his restoration.  In the beginning of December, Kafa began to make arrangements for his journey, and to complete the purchase of his slaves.  As he had to be absent about his affairs for a month, Park was left during the time to the care of a good old Bushreen, who acted as schoolmaster to the younger people of Kamalia.  The long-wished-for day of the departure of the caravan, the 19th of April, at length arrived, and the irons being removed from the slaves, the _slatees_ assembled at the door of Kafa's house, where the bundles were all tied up, and everyone had his load assigned him.  Kafa had twenty-seven slaves for sale, but eight others afterwards joined them, making in all thirty-five.  The schoolmaster who was on his return to Woradoo, the place of his nativity, took with him eight of his scholars.  Altogether, the come numbered seventy-three persons.  The caravan was followed for about half a mile by most of the inhabitants of Kamalia; and when they had arrived at the top of a hill, from whence they had a view of the town, they were all ordered to sit down--those belonging to the coffle with their faces towards the west, and the townspeople with theirs towards Kamalia.  The schoolmaster, with two of the principal _slatees_, having taken their places between the two parties, pronounced a solemn prayer, after which they walked three times round the coffle, making impressions in the ground with the ends of their spears, and muttering something by way of a charm.  When this ceremony was ended, all the people belonging to the coffle sprang up and, without taking a formal farewell of their friends, set forward.  Another ceremony was performed when the party stopped to dine on the road.  Before commencing the meal, when each person was seated with their quotas arranged before him in small gourd shells, the schoolmaster offered up a short prayer that God and the holy prophet might preserve them from robbers and all bad people, that their provisions might never fail nor their limbs become fatigued.  After stopping at the town of Kenytakooro till the 22nd of April, the coffle commenced the journey through the Jallonka wilderness.  The country was very beautiful and abounded with birds and deer; but so anxious were they to push on, that they made fully thirty miles that day.  Fatigued as they were, they were frequently disturbed in the night by the howling of wild beasts and the bites of ants.  On setting out in the morning Nealee, one of Kafa's female slaves refused to drink the gruel offered her.  The country was extremely wild and rocky, and Park began to fear that he should be unable to keep up with the party.  Others, however, suffered more than he did.  The poor female slave began to lag behind; and, complaining dreadfully of pains in her legs, her load was taken from her and given to another, and she was ordered to keep in front of the coffle.  As the party were resting near a rivulet a hive of bees was discovered in a hollow tree, and some of the people were proceeding to obtain the honey, when an enormous swarm flew out, and, attacking every one, made them fly in every direction.  Park being the first to take alarm, was the only person who escaped with impunity.  The slaves had, however, left their bundles behind them, and to obtain them it was necessary to set the grass on fire to the east of the hive, when the wind driving the flames along, the men pushed through the smoke and recovered their bundles.  They also brought with them poor Nealee, whom they found lying by the rivulet stung in the most dreadful manner.  On her refusing to proceed further, she was cruelly beaten with a whip, when, suddenly starting up, she walked for four or five hours; she then made an attempt to run away, but, from weakness, fell to the ground.  Though unable to rise, the whip was a second time applied, when Kafa ordered that she should be placed on an ass.  Unable to sit on it, she was carried afterwards on a litter by two slaves.  The unfortunate slaves, who had travelled all day in the hot sun with loads on their heads, were dreadfully fatigued; and some of them began to snap their fingers--a sure sign, among negroes, of desperation.  They were, therefore, put in irons, and kept apart from each other.  Next day poor Nealee was again placed on the ass; but unable to hold herself on, frequently fell to the ground.  At length the cry arose of--\"_Kang-tegi_!\"  (\"Cut her throat!\") As Park did not wish to see this horrible operation performed, he went on ahead; but soon afterwards he was overtaken by one of Kafa's domestic slaves with poor Nealee's garment on the end of a bow.  On making inquiries of the man, he replied that Kafa and the schoolmaster would not consent to her being killed, but had left her on the road, where probably she was soon devoured by wild animals.  Such is one example of the cruel treatment received by the unhappy slaves.  The old schoolmaster, however, was so affected, that he fasted the whole of the ensuing day.  The party now travelled on rapidly, everyone being apprehensive that he might otherwise meet with the fate of poor Nealee.  The coffle had still many dangers to encounter.  Receiving information that two hundred Jallonkas were lying in wait to plunder them, they altered their course and travelled with great secrecy until midnight, when they entered the town of Koba.  Here they remained some days to escape the Jallonkas.  The next town they reached, Malacotta, was the birthplace of the schoolmaster, whose brother came out to meet him.  The interview was very natural and affecting.  They fell on each other's neck, and it was some time before either of them could speak.  The schoolmaster then turning, pointed to Kafa, saying, \"This is the man who has been my father in Manding.  I would have pointed him out sooner to you, but my heart was too full.\"  They were now in the country of friends, and were well"]]]
