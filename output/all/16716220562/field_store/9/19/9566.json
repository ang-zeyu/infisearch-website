Cheerfully removing his holiday regalia, he donned a faded and mended khaki suit and a pair of worn trousers, and as he did so he gave a little rueful chuckle at the thought of poor Roscoe struggling with the tangled thicket in a regular suit of clothes and without any of the facilities that a scout would be sure to take.  He slipped on an old coat, into the pocket of which he put his flashlight, some matches in an airtight box, his scout knife and a little bottle of antiseptic. Thus equipped, he felt natural and at home, and he looked as if he meant business.  Putting the plush box into his pocket, he descended the stairs quietly and slipped into the street. He hurried now, for he wished to get into the city in time to catch the noon train for Catskill.  At the end of Culver Street he turned into Williams Avenue and hurried along through its din and turmoil, and past its tawdry shops until he came to one which he had not seen in many a day. The sight of its dirty window, filled with a disorderly assortment of familiar articles, took him back to the old life in Barrel Alley and the days when his good-for-nothing father had sent him down here with odds and ends of clothing to be turned into money for supper or breakfast.  It spoke well for the self-respect which Tom had gained that he walked past this place several times before he could muster the courage to enter. When he did enter, the old familiar, musty smell and the sordid litter of the shelves renewed his unhappy memories.  \"I have to get some money,\" he said, laying the plush case on the counter. \"I have to get five dollars.\"  He knew from rueful experience that one can seldom get as much as he wants in such a place, and five dollars would at least get him to his destination. Surely, he thought, Roscoe would have some money.  There were a few seconds of dreadful suspense while the man took the precious Gold Cross over to the window and scrutinized it.  \"Three,\" he said, coming back to the counter.  \"I _got_ to have five,\" said Tom.  The man shook his head. \"Three,\" he repeated.  \"I got to have five,\" Tom insisted. \"I'm going to get it back soon.\"  The man hesitated, and looked at him keenly. \"All right, five,\" he said reluctantly.  Tom's hand almost trembled as he emerged into the bright sunlight, thrusting the ticket into a pocket which he seldom used. He had not examined it, and he did not wish to read it or be reminded of it. He felt ashamed, almost degraded; but he was satisfied that he had done the right thing.  \"I thought that trail made a bee-line for the platform in the Lyceum,\" he said to himself, as he folded his five-dollar bill. \"Gee, it's a funny thing; you never know where it's going to take you!\"  And you never know who or what is going to cross your trail, either, for scarcely had he descended the steps of that stuffy den when whom should he see staring at him from directly across the street but Worry Benson and Will McAdam, of the other local scout troop.  They were evidently bent on some patriotic duty when they paused in surprise at seeing him, for they had with them a big flag pole and several bundles which looked as if they might contain printed matter.  Tom thought that perhaps these were a rush order of programs for the patriotic rally, and he wondered if they might possibly contain his name--printed in type.  But he thrust the thought away from him and, clutching his five dollars in his pocket, he turned down the street and started along the good scout trail.     CHAPTER VIII  AN ACCIDENT   The latter part of the afternoon found Tom many miles from Bridgeboro, and the trail which had passed through such sordid and pride-racking surroundings back in his home town, now led up through a quiet woodland, where there was no sound but the singing of the birds and an occasional rustle or breaking of a twig as some startled wild creature hurried to shelter.  Through the intertwined foliage overhead Tom could catch little glints of the blue sky, and once, when he climbed a tree to get his bearings, he could see, far in the distance, the lake and the clearing of Temple Camp, and could even distinguish the flagpole.  But no flag flew from it, for the season had not yet begun; Jeb Rushmore was on a visit to his former \"pals\" in the West, and the camp was closed tight. Down there was where Tom had won the Gold Cross.  He would have liked to see a flag waving, for Bridgeboro, with all its patriotic fervor and bustle, seemed very far away now, and though he was in a country which he loved and which meant much to him, he would have been glad of some tangible reminder that he was, as he had told himself, _with the Colors_.  Tom had left the train at Catskill Landing and reached the hill by a circuitous, unfrequented route, hoping to reach, before dark, the clearer path which he himself had made and blazed from the vicinity of Temple Camp to the little hunting shack upon the hill's summit. This, he felt sure, was the path Roscoe would follow.  It was almost dark when, having picked his way through a very jungle where there was no more sign of path than there is in the sky, he emerged upon the familiar trail at a point about a mile below the shack.  He was breathless from his tussle with the tangled underbrush, his old clothes had some fresh tears, and his hands were cut and bleeding.  For three solid hours he had worked his way up through the tangled forest, and now, as he reached the little trail which was not without its own obstacles, it seemed almost like a paved thoroughfare by contrast.  \"Thank goodness!\" he breathed. \"It's good _he_ didn't have to go that way--I--could see _his_ finish!\"  He was the scout now, the typical scout--determined, resourceful; and his tattered khaki jacket, his slouched hat, his rolled-up sleeves, and the belt axe which he carried in his hand, bespoke the rugged power and strong will of this young fellow who had trembled when Miss Margaret Ellison spoke pleasantly to him.  He sat down on a rock and poured some antiseptic over the scratches on his hands and arms.  \"I can fight the woods, all right,\" he muttered, \"even if they won't let me go off and fight the Germans.\"  After a few minutes' rest he hurried along the trail, pausing here and there and searching for any trifling sign which might indicate that the path had been recently traveled. Once his hopes of finding Roscoe were dashed by the discovery of a cobweb across the trail, but when he felt of it and found it sticky to the touch he knew that it had just been made.  At last, hard though the ground was, he discovered a new footprint, and presently its meaning was confirmed when he caught a glint of light far ahead of him among the trees.  At the sight of it his heart gave a great bound. He knew now for a certainty that he was right. He had known it all along, but he was doubly assured of it now.  On the impulse he started to run, but his foot slipped upon an exposed root, and as he fell sprawling on the ground his head struck with a violent impact on a big stone.  After a few stunned seconds he dragged himself to a sitting posture; his head throbbed cruelly, and when he put his hand to his forehead he found that it was bleeding. He tried to stand, but when he placed his weight upon his left foot it gave him excruciating pain.  He sat down on the rock, dizzy and faint, holding his throbbing head and lifting his foot to ease, if possible, the agonizing pain.  \"I'm all right,\" he muttered impatiently. \"I was a fool to start running; I might have known I was too tired.\"  That was indeed the plain truth of the matter; he was so weary and spent that when, in the new assurance of success, he had begun to run, his tired feet had dragged and tripped him.  \"That's what--you--get for--hurrying,\" he breathed heavily; \"like Roy always said--more haste--less---- Ouch, my ankle!\"  He tried again to stand, but the pain was too great, and his head swam so that he fell back on the rock.  \"I wish Doc--Carson--was here,\" he managed to say. Doc was the troop's First-Aid Scout. \"It--it was just--because I didn't--lift my feet--like Roy's always telling me--so clumsy!\"  He soaked his handkerchief in antiseptic and bound it about his forehead, which was bleeding less profusely. After a few minutes, feeling less dizzy, he stood upon his feet, with a stoical disregard of the pain, determined to continue his journey if he possibly could.  The agony was excruciating, but he set his strong, thick lips tight, and, passing from one tree to another, with the aid of his hands, he managed to get along. More than once he stopped, clinging to a tree trunk, and raised his foot to ease the anguish. His head throbbed with a cruel, steady ache, and the faintness persisted so that often he felt he was about to reel, and only kept his feet by clinging to the trees.  \"This--this is just about--the time I'd be going to that--racket----\" he said. \"Gee, but that foot hurts!\"  He would have made a sorry figure on the platform. His old khaki jacket and trousers were almost in shreds. Bloodstains were all over his shirt. A great bloody scratch was visible upon his cheek. His hands were cut by brambles. There was a grim look on his dirty, scarred face. I am not so sure that he would have looked any nobler if he had been in the first-line trenches, fighting for Uncle Sam....     CHAPTER IX  ROSCOE JOINS THE COLORS   It was now nearly dark, and Tom worked his way along slowly, hobbling where there were no trees, and grateful for their support when he found them bordering the trail. His foot pained him exquisitely and he still felt weak and dizzy.  At last, after almost superhuman efforts, he brought himself within sight of the dark outline of the shack, which seemed more lonesome and isolated than ever before. He saw that the light was from a fire in the clearing near by, and a smaller light was discernible in the window of the shack itself.  Tom had always stood rather in awe of Roscoe "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20986"],["title","Tom Slade with the Colors (#7)"],["body","Bent, as one of humble origin and simple ways is apt to feel toward those who live in a different world. And even now, in this altogether strange situation and with all the advantages both of right and courage on his side, he could not repress something of the same feeling, as he approached the little camp.  He dragged himself to within a few feet of the fire and stood clutching a tree and leaning against it as Roscoe Bent, evidently startled, came out and faced him.  A pathetic and ghastly figure Tom must have looked to the fugitive, who stood staring at him, lantern in hand, as if Tom were some ghostly scarecrow dropped from the clouds.  \"It's me--Tom Slade,\" Tom panted. \"You--needn't be scared.\"  Roscoe looked suspiciously about him and peered down the dark trail behind Tom.  \"What are _you_ doing here?\" he demanded roughly. \"Is anybody with you? Who'd you bring----\"  \"No, there ain't,\" said Tom, almost reeling. His weakness and the fear of collapsing before he could speak gave him courage, but he forgot the little speech which he had prepared, and poured out a torrent which completely swept away any little advantage of self-possession that Roscoe might have had.  \"I didn't bring anybody!\" he shouted weakly. \"Do you think I'm a spy? Did you ever know a scout that was a _sneak_? Me and you--are all alone here. I knew you was here. I _knew_ you'd come here, because you're _crazy_. I seen--saw--\"  It was characteristic of Tom that on the infrequent occasions when he became angry, or his feelings got the better of him, he would fall into the old illiterate phraseology of Barrel Alley. He steadied himself against the tree now and tried to speak more calmly.  \"D'you think just 'cause you jollied me and made a fool out of me in front of Miss Ellison that I wouldn't be a friend to you? Do you think\"--he shouted, losing all control of himself--\"that because I didn't know how to talk to you and--and--answer you--like--that I was a-scared of you? Did you think I couldn't find you easy enough? Maybe I'm--maybe I'm thick--but when I get on a trail--there's--there's nothin' can stop me. I got the strength ter strangle _you_--if I wanted to!\" he fairly shrieked.  Then he subsided from sheer exhaustion.  Roscoe Bent had stood watching him as a man might watch a thunderstorm. \"You hurt yourself,\" he said irrelevantly.  \"It says in a paper,\" panted Tom, \"that--that a man that's afraid to die ain't--fit to live. D'you think I'd leave--I'd let you--stay away and have people callin' you a coward and a--a slacker--and then somebody--those secret service fellows--come and get you? I wouldn't let them get you,\" he shouted, clutching the tree to steady himself, \"'cause I know the trail, I do--I'm a scout--and _I got here first_--I----\"  His hand slipped from the tree, he reeled and fell to the ground too quick for Roscoe to catch him.  \"It's--it's all right,\" he muttered, as Roscoe bent over him. \"I ain't hurt.... Roll your coat up tight--you'd know, if you was a scout--and put it under my neck. I--want a drink--of water.... You got to begin right now to-night, Rossie, with the Colors; you got to begin--by--by bein' a Red Cross nurse.... I'm goin' to call you Rossie now--like the fellers in the bank,\" he ended weakly, \"'cause we're friends to each other--kind of.\"     CHAPTER X  TOM AND ROSCOE COME TO KNOW EACH OTHER   \"I don't know what I said,\" said Tom; \"I was kind of crazy, I guess.\"  \"I guess I'm the one that was crazy,\" said Roscoe. \"Does your head hurt now?\"  \"Nope. It's a good thick head, that's one sure thing. Once Roy Blakeley dropped his belt-axe on it around camp-fire, and he thought he must have killed me. But it didn't hurt much. Look out the coffee don't boil over.\"  Roscoe Bent looked at him curiously for a few seconds. It was early the next morning, and Tom, after sleeping fairly well in the one rough bunk in the shack, was sitting up and directing Roscoe, who was preparing breakfast out of the stores which he had brought.  \"I guess that's why I didn't get wise when you first asked me about this place--'cause my head's so thick. Roy claimed he got a splinter from my head. He's awful funny, Roy is.... If I'd 'a' known in time,\" he added impassively, \"I could 'a' started earlier and headed you off. I wouldn't 'a' had to stop to chop down trees.\"  \"Why didn't you swim across the brook?\" Roscoe asked. \"All scouts swim, don't they?\"  \"Sure, but that's where Temple Camp gets its drinking water--from that brook; and every scout promised he wouldn't ever swim in it. It wasn't hard, chopping down the tree.\"  Roscoe gazed into Tom's almost expressionless face with a kind of puzzled look.  \"It don't make any difference now,\" said Tom, \"which way I came. Anyway, you couldn't of got back yesterday--before the places closed up. Maybe we've got to kind of know each other, sort of, being here like this. You got to camp with a feller if you want to really know him.\"  Roscoe Bent said nothing.  \"As long as you get back to-day and register, it's all right,\" said Tom. \"They'll let you.--It ain't none of my business what you tell 'em. You don't even have to tell me what you're going to tell 'em.\"  \"I can't tell them I just ran away,\" said Roscoe dubiously.  \"It's none of _my_ business what you tell 'em,\" repeated Tom, \"so long as you go back _to-day_ and register. When you get it over with, it'll be all right,\" he added. \"_I_ know how it was--you just got rattled.... The first time I got lost in the woods I felt that way. All you got to do is to go back and say you want to register.\"  \"I said I would, didn't I?\" said Roscoe.  \"Nobody'll ever know that I had anything to do with it,\" said Tom.  \"Are you sure?\" Roscoe asked doubtfully.  \"They'd have to kill me before I'd tell,\" said Tom.  Roscoe looked at him again--at the frowning face and the big, tight-set mouth--and knew that this was true.  \"How about _you_?\" he asked. \"What'll they think?\"  \"That don't make any difference,\" said Tom. \"I ain't thinkin' of that. If you always do what you know is right, you needn't worry. You won't get misjudged. I've read that somewhere.\"  Roscoe, who knew more about the ways of the world than poor Tom did, shook his head dubiously. He served the coffee and some crackers and dry breakfast food of which he had brought a number of packages, and they ate of this makeshift repast as they continued their talk.  \"You ought to have brought bacon,\" said Tom. \"You must never go camping without bacon--and egg powder. There's about twenty different things you can do with egg powder. If you'd brought flour, we could make some flapjacks.\"  \"I'm a punk camper,\" admitted Roscoe.  \"You can see for yourself,\" said Tom, with blunt frankness, \"that you'd have been up against it here pretty soon. You'd have had to go to Leeds for stuff, and they'd ask you for your registration card, maybe.\"  \"I don't see how I'm going to leave you here,\" Roscoe said doubtfully.  \"I'll be all right,\" said Tom.  \"What will you say to them when you come home?\"  \"I'll tell 'em I ain't going to answer any questions. I'll say I had to go away for something very important.\"  \"You'll be in bad,\" Roscoe said thoughtfully.  \"I won't be misjudged,\" said Tom simply; \"I got the reputation of being kind o' queer, anyway, and they'll just say I had a freak. You can see for yourself,\" he added, \"that it wouldn't be good for us to go back together--even if my foot was all right.\"  \"It's better, isn't it?\" Roscoe asked anxiously.  \"Sure it is. It's only strained--that's different from being sprained--and my head's all right now.\"  \"What will you do?\" Roscoe asked, looking troubled and unconvinced in spite of Tom's assurances.  \"I was going to come up here and camp alone over the Fourth of July, anyway,\" said Tom. \"I always meant to do that. I'll call this a vacation--as you might say. I got to thank _you_ for that.\"  \"You've got to thank _me_ for a whole lot,\" said Roscoe ironically; \"for a broken head and a lame ankle and missing all the fun last night, and losing your job, maybe.\"  \"I ain't worryin',\" said Tom. \"I hit the right trail.\"  \"And saved me from being--no, I'm one, anyway, now----\"  \"No, you ain't; you just got rattled. Now you can see straight, so you have to go back right away. As soon as my foot's better, I'll go down to Temple Camp. That'll be to-morrow--or _sure_ day after to-morrow. I'm going to look around the camp and see if everything is all right, and then I'll hike into Leeds and go down by the train. If I was to go limping back, they might think things; and, anyway, it's better for you to get there alone.\"  \"Are you _sure_ your foot'll be all right?\" Roscoe asked.  \"Sure. I'll read that book of yours, and maybe I'll catch some trout for lunch ...\"  Roscoe sprang forward impulsively and grasped Tom's hand.  \"Now you spilled my coffee,\" said Tom impassively.  \"Tom, I don't know how to take you,\" Roscoe said feelingly; \"you're a puzzle to me. I never realized what sort of a chap you were--when I used to make fun of you and jolly you. Let's feel your old muscle,\" he added, on the impulse. \"I wish _I_ had a muscle like that....\"  \"Tie a double cord around it, and I'll break the cord,\" said Tom simply.  \"I bet you can,\" said Roscoe proudly, \"and--you saved me from ... I don't know what you did it for....\"  \"I got no objections to telling you,\" said Tom. \"It's because I liked you. There might have been other reasons, but that's the main one. If I only knew how to act and talk--especially to girls--and kind of make them laugh and----\"  \"Don't talk that way,\" said Roscoe, sitting on the edge of the bunk and speaking with great earnestness. \"You make me feel like a--like a criminal. Me! What am I? You tell Margaret Ellison about how you can break a cord around your arm--and see what she'll say. _That's_ the kind of things they like to know about you. You don't know much about them----\"  \"I never claimed I did,\" said Tom.  \"Here, I'm going to try you--call your bluff,\" said Roscoe, with a"]]]
