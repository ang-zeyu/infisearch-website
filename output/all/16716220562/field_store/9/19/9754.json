Where were they now?  The morning light, and the sight of the house perhaps, had driven them off.  But their spoor was quite fresh.  They were near at hand, and would be certain to return again upon the following night.  Von Bloom felt a strong desire to be revenged upon the hideous brutes; and, under other circumstances, would have remained to get a shot at them.  But just then that would have been both imprudent and unprofitable work.  It would be as much as their horses could accomplish, to get back to camp that night; so, without even entering the old house, they watered their animals, refilled their calabashes at the spring, and with heavy hearts once more rode away from the kraal.    CHAPTER NINE.  A LION \"COUCHANT.\"  They had not proceeded an hundred steps when an object appeared before them that caused all three to draw bridle suddenly and simultaneously. That object was a lion!  He was couched upon the plain directly in the path they intended to take--the very same path by which they had come!  How was it they had not seen him before?  He was under the lee of a low bush; but, thanks to the locusts, this bush was leafless, and its thin naked twigs formed no concealment for so large a creature as a lion. His tawny hide shone conspicuously through them.  The truth is, he had not been there when the horsemen passed towards the kraal.  He had just fled from among the carcasses, on seeing them approach; and had skulked around the walls, and then run to their rear. He had executed this manoeuvre to avoid an encounter--for a lion reasons as a man does, though not to the same extent.  Seeing the horsemen come that way, his reasoning powers were strong enough to tell him that they were not likely to return by the same path.  It was more natural they should continue on.  A man, ignorant of all the preceding events connected with their journey would have reasoned much in the same way. If you have been at all observant, you have seen other animals--such as dogs, deer, hares, or even birds--act just as the lion did on this occasion.  Beyond a doubt the intellectual process described passed through the mind of this lion; and he had skulked round to shun an encounter with the three travellers.  Now a lion will not always act so--though he will in five cases out of six, or oftener.  Hence very erroneous views are held in relation to the courage of this animal.  Some naturalists, led away by what appears to be a feeling of envy or anger, accuse the lion of downright _cowardice_, denying him a single noble quality of all those that have from earliest times been ascribed to him!  Others, on the contrary, assert that he knows no fear, either of man or beast; and these endow him with many virtues besides courage.  Both parties back up their views, not by mere assertions, but by an ample narration of well-attested facts!  How is this?  There is a dilemma here.  Both cannot be right in their opinions?  And yet, odd as it may appear to say so, both _are_ right in a certain sense.  The fact is, _some lions are cowardly, while others are brave_.  The truth of this might be shown by whole pages of facts, but in this little volume we have not room.  I think, however, boy reader, I can satisfy you with an analogy.  Answer me--Do you know any species of animal, the individuals of which are exactly alike in character?  Think over the dogs _of your acquaintance_!  Are they alike, or anything near it?  Are not some of them noble, generous, faithful, brave to the death?  Are not others mean, sneaking, cowardly curs?  So is it with lions.  Now, you are satisfied that my statement about the lions may be true.  There are many causes to affect the courage and ferocity of the lion. His age--the state of his stomach--the season of the year--the hour of the day--but, above all, the _sort of hunters that belong to the district he inhabits_.  This last fact appears quite natural to those who believe in the _intellect_ of animals, which of course _I_ do.  It is perfectly natural that the lion, as well as other animals, should soon learn the character of his enemy, and fear him or not, as the case may be.  Is this not an old story with us?  If I remember aright, we had a talk upon this subject when speaking of the crocodiles of America.  We remarked that the alligator of the Mississippi rarely attacks man in modern times; but it has not been always so.  The rifle of the alligator-leather hunter has tamed its ferocity.  The very _same species_ in South America eats Indians by scores every year; and the crocodile of Africa is dreaded in some parts even more than the lion!  It is asserted that the lions of the Cape are more cowardly in some districts than in others.  They are less brave in those districts where they have been \"jaged\" by the courageous and stalwart boor with his long loud-cracking \"roer.\"  Beyond the frontier, where they have no enemy but the tiny arrow of the Bushman (who does not desire to kill them!) and the slender \"assegai\" of the Bechuana, the lion has little or no fear of man.  Whether the one, before the eyes of our party, was naturally a brave one, could not yet be told.  He was one with a huge black mane, or \"schwart-fore life,\" as the boors term it; and these are esteemed the fiercest and most dangerous.  The \"yellow-maned,\"--for there is considerable variety in the colour of the Cape lions--is regarded as possessing less courage; but there is some doubt about the truth of this.  The young \"black-manes\" may often be mistaken for the true yellow variety, and their character ascribed to him to his prejudice,--for the swarthy colour of the mane only comes after the lion is many years of age.  Whether the \"schwart-fore life\" was a fierce and brave one, Von Bloom did not stay to think about.  It was evident that the edge had been taken off the animal's appetite.  It was evident he did not meditate an attack; and that had the horsemen chosen to make a detour, and ride peacefully away, they might have continued their journey without ever seeing or hearing of him again.  But the field-cornet had no such intention.  He had lost his precious oxen and cattle.  _That_ lion had pulled down some of them, at least. The Dutch blood was up, and if the beast had been the strongest and fiercest of his tribe, he was bound to be brought out of that bush.  Ordering the others to remain where they were, Von Bloom advanced on horseback until within about fifty paces of where the lion lay.  Here he drew up, coolly dismounted, passed the bridle over his arm, stuck his loading-rod into the ground, and knelt down behind it.  You will fancy he would have been safer to have kept his saddle, as the lion cannot overtake a horse.  True; but the lion would have been safer too.  It is no easy matter to fire correctly from any horse, but when the mark happens to be a grim lion, he is a well-trained steed that will stand sufficiently firm to admit of a true aim.  A shot from the saddle under such circumstances is a mere chance shot; and the field-cornet was not in the mood to be satisfied with a chance shot.  Laying his roer athwart the loading-rod, and holding the long barrel steady against it, he took deliberate aim through the ivory sights.  During all this time the lion had not stirred.  The bush was between him and the hunter; but he could hardly have believed that it sufficed to conceal him.  Far from it.  His yellow flanks were distinctly visible through the thorny twigs, and his head could be seen with his muzzle and whiskers stained red with the blood of the oxen.  No--he did not believe himself hid.  A slight growl, with one or two shakes of his tail, proved the contrary.  He lay still however, as lions usually do, until more nearly approached.  The hunter, as already stated, was full fifty yards from him.  Excepting the motion of his tail, he made no other till Von Bloom pulled trigger; and then with a scream he sprang several feet into the air. The hunter had been afraid of the twigs causing his bullet to glance off; but it was plain it had told truly, for he saw the fur fly from the side of that lion where it struck him.  It was but a wound; and not deadly, as soon appeared.  With long bounds the angry brute came on--lashing his tail, and showing his fearful teeth.  His mane, now on end, seemed to have doubled his size.  He looked as large as a bull!  In a _few_ seconds time he had crossed the distance that separated him from the hunter, but the latter was gone far from that spot.  The moment he had delivered his fire, he leaped upon his well-trained horse, and rode off towards the others.  All three were for a short while together--Hendrik holding his yager cocked and ready, while Swartboy grasped his bow and arrows.  But the lion dashed forward before either could fire; and they were obliged to spur and gallop out of his way.  Swartboy had ridden to one side, while Von Bloom and Hendrik took the other; and the game was now between the two parties--both of which had pulled up at some distance off.  The lion, after the failure of his charge, halted, and looked first at one, then at the other--as if uncertain which to pursue.  His appearance at this moment was terrible beyond expression.  His whole fierce nature was roused.  His mane stood erect--his tail lasher his flanks--his mouth, widely open, showed the firm-set trenchant teeth-- their white spikes contrasting with the red blood that clotted his cheeks and snout, while his angry roaring added horror to his appearance.  But none of the three were terrified out of their senses.  Hendrik at this moment covered him with his rifle, took cool aim, and fired; while at the same instant Swartboy sent an arrow whistling through the air.  Both had aimed truly.  Both bullet and arrow struck; and the shaft of the latter could be seen sticking in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21238"],["title","The Castaways (#0)"],["body","Castaways  By Captain Mayne Reid ________________________________________________________________________ This is certainly not a very long book, being about a half to a third of most books of this genre.  It starts off with a group of people in a ship's boat, the ship itself having foundered in a typhoon in the Celebes sea.  The ship's captain and his two children, the Irish ship's carpenter, and the Malay pilot, are all that finally come to shore, though when the book starts there are a body that has to be thrown overboard, and a seaman who has gone mad and who throws himself there.  Thereafter we are introduced to one natural history topic per chapter, be it a plant, a tree or an animal.  There are various perils that have to be overcome--the upas tree, an ourang-outang, a tree that drops its fruit like a heavy bomb, a python, and quite a few more.  Luckily they don't meet any unfriendly Dyaks during the journey they undertake to get from their landing-place to the town of Bruni, many hundreds of miles away.  On the whole they are saved by the courage, knowledge and skill of the co-hero, the Malay pilot, who is one of the best in that region with a blow-pipe. He makes himself one, and it is just as well he did, as you will see.  The book is well-written, and as it will only take you five hours or less, you could probably find the time to read it.  NH ________________________________________________________________________  THE CASTAWAYS  BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID    CHAPTER ONE.  A CASTAWAY CREW.  A boat upon the open sea--no land in sight!  It is an open boat, the size and form showing it to be the pinnace of a merchant-ship.  It is a tropical sea, with a fiery sun overhead, slowly coursing through a sky of brilliant azure.  The boat has neither sail nor mast.  There are oars, but no one is using them.  They lie athwart the tholes, their blades dipping in the water, with no hand upon the grasp.  And yet the boat is not empty.  Seven human forms are seen within it,-- six of them living, and one dead.  Of the living, four are full-grown men; three of them white, the fourth of an umber-brown, or _bistre_ colour.  One of the white men is tall, dark and bearded, with features bespeaking him either a European or an American, though their somewhat elongated shape and classic regularity would lead to a belief that he is the latter, and in all probability a native of New York.  And so he is.  The features of the white man sitting nearest to him are in strange contrast to his, as is also the colour of his hair and skin.  The hair is of a carroty shade, while his complexion, originally reddish, through long exposure to a tropical sun exhibits a yellowish, freckled appearance.  The countenance so marked is unmistakably of Milesian type. So it should be, as its owner is an Irishman.  The third white man, of thin, lank frame, with face almost beardless, pale cadaverous cheeks, and eyes sunken in their sockets, and there rolling wildly, is one of those nondescripts who may be English, Irish, Scotch, or American.  His dress betokens him to be a seaman, a common sailor.  He of the brown complexion, with flat spreading nose, high cheek-bones, oblique eyes, and straight, raven black hair, is evidently a native of the East, a Malay.  The two other living figures in the boat are those of a boy and girl. They are white.  They differ but little in size, and but a year or two in age, the girl being fourteen and the boy about sixteen.  There is also a resemblance in their features.  They are brother and sister.  The fourth white, who lies dead in the bottom of the boat, is also dressed in seaman's clothes, and has evidently in his lifetime been a common sailor.  It is but a short time since the breath departed from his body; and judging by the appearance of the others, it may not be long before they will all follow him into another world.  How weak and emaciated they appear, as if in the last stage of starvation!  The boy and girl lie along the stern-sheets, with wasted arms, embracing each other.  The tall man sits on one of the benches, gazing mechanically upon the corpse at his feet; while the other three also have their eyes upon it, though with very different expressions.  That upon the face of the Irishman is of sadness, as if for the loss of an old shipmate; the Malay looks on with the impassive tranquillity peculiar to his race; while in the sunken orbs of the nondescript can be detected a look that speaks of a horrible craving--the craving of cannibalism.  The scene described, and the circumstances which have led to it, call for explanation.  It is easily given.  The tall dark-bearded man is Captain Robert Redwood, the skipper of an American merchant-vessel, for some time trading among the islands of the Indian Archipelago.  The Irishman is his ship-carpenter, the Malay his pilot, while the others are two common sailors of his crew.  The boy and girl are his children, who, having no mother or near relatives at home, have been brought along with him on his trading voyage to the Eastern Isles.  The vessel passing from Manilla, in the Philippines, to the Dutch settlement of Macassar, in the island of Celebes, has been caught in a _typhoon_ and swamped near the middle of the Celebes Sea; her crew have escaped in a boat--the pinnace--but saved from death by drowning only to find, most of them, the same watery grave after long-procrastinated suffering from thirst, from hunger, from all the agonies of starvation.  One after another have they succumbed, and been thrown overboard, until the survivors are only six in number.  And these are but skeletons, each looking as if another day, or even another hour, might terminate his wretched existence.  It may seem strange that the youthful pair in the stern-sheets, still but tender children, and the girl more especially, should have withstood the terrible suffering beyond a period possible to many strong men, tough sailors every one of them.  But it is not so strange after all, or rather after knowing that, in the struggle with starvation, youth always proves itself superior to age, and tender childhood will live on where manhood gives way to the weakness of inanition.  That Captain Redwood is himself one of the strongest of the survivors may be due partly to the fact of his having a higher organism than that of his ship-comrades.  But, no doubt, he is also sustained by the presence of the two children, his affection for them and fear for their fate warding off despair, and so strengthening within him the principle of vitality.  If affection has aught to do with preserving life, it is strong enough in the Irishman to account also for the preservation of his; for although but the carpenter in Captain Redwood's ship, he regards the captain with a feeling almost fraternal.  He had been one of his oldest and steadiest hands, and long service has led to a fast friendship between him and his old skipper.  On the part of the Irishman, this feeling is extended to the youthful couple who recline, with clasped hands, along the sternmost seat of the pinnace.  As for the Malay, thirst and hunger have also made their marks upon him; but not as with those of Occidental race.  It may be that his bronze skin does not show so plainly the pallor of suffering; but, at all events, he still looks lithe and life-like, supple and sinewy, as if he could yet take a spell at the oar, and keep alive as long as skin and bone held together.  If all are destined to die in that open boat, he will certainly be the last.  He with the hollow eyes looks as if he would be the first.  Down upon this wretched group, a picture of misery itself, shines the hot sun of the tropics; around it, far as eye could reach, extends the calm sea, glassed, and glancing back his lays, as though they were reflected from a sheet of liquid fire; beneath them gleams a second firmament through the pellucid water, a sky peopled with strange forms that are not birds: more like are they to dragons; for among them can be seen the horrid form of the devil-fish, and the still more hideous figure of the hammer-headed shark.  And alone is that boat above them, seemingly suspended in the air, and only separated from these dreadful monsters by a few feet of clear water, through which they can dart with the speed of electricity.  Alone, with no land in sight, no ship or sail, no other boat--nothing that can give them a hope.  All bright above, around, and beneath; but within their hearts only darkness and the dread of death!    CHAPTER TWO.  THE HAMMER-HEAD.  For some time the castaways had been seated in moody silence, now and then glancing at the corpse in the bottom of the boat, some of them no doubt thinking how long it might be before they themselves would occupy the same situation.  But now and then, also, their looks were turned upon one another, not hopefully, but with a mechanical effort of despair.  In one of these occasional glances, Captain Redwood noticed the unnatural glare in the eyes of the surviving sailor, as also did the Irishman.  Simultaneously were both struck with it, and a significant look was exchanged between them.  For a period of over twenty hours this man had been behaving oddly; and they had conceived something more than a suspicion of his insanity.  The death of the sailor lying at the bottom of the boat, now the ninth, had rendered him for a time more tranquil, and he sat quiet on his seat, with elbows resting on his knees, his cheeks held between the palms of his hands.  But the wild stare in his eyes seemed to have become only more intensified as he kept them fixed upon the corpse of his comrade. It was a look worse than wild; it had in it the expression of _craving_.  On perceiving it, and after a moment spent in reflection, the captain made a sign to the ship-carpenter, at the same time saying,--  \"Murtagh, it's no use our keeping the body any longer in the boat.  Let us give it such burial as the sea vouchsafes to a "]]]
