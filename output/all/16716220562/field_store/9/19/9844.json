Old Slegge's along with them, and he'll be getting up a quarrel again. I don't want to fight; but if he keeps on aggravating like he did this morning I suppose I shall have to.\"  \"But if we go now,\" said Singh, \"it will look as if we are frightened. We seemed to run away before, only you made me come.\"  \"Oh, it doesn't matter what seems,\" cried Severn irritably.  \"We know we are not frightened, and that's enough.  Come on.\"  The two boys began to move slowly away; but they had not gone far before Slegge shouted after them, \"Hi, you, sirs!  I want you to come and field.\"  \"Then want will be your master,\" said Severn between his teeth.--\"Come on, Singh.  Don't look round.  Let's pretend we can't hear.\"  They walked steadily on for a few paces, Severn making-believe to be talking earnestly to his companion, when:  \"Do you hear, there, you, sirs?  Come here directly.  I want you to field!\"  \"I dare say you do; cheeky great bully!\" said Glyn softly.  \"I shan't come and field for you.  The Doctor did not give us a holiday to-day to come and be your slaves.\"  \"Hi, there!  Are you coming, or am I to come and fetch you?\" shouted Slegge, without any effect, and the big lad turned to Burney and gave him an order.  The next minute the boy, armed with a stump, came running at full speed across the grass, shouting to the two companions to stop, but without their paying the slightest heed or increasing their pace.  The consequence was that the lad soon overtook them, to cry, rather out of breath, \"Did you hear the captain call to you to come and field?\"  Singh glanced at Glyn, who gave him a sharp look as he replied, \"Yes, I heard him quite plainly.\"  The messenger stared with open eyes and mouth, as if it was beyond his comprehension.  \"Then, why don't you come?\" he cried.  \"Because we are going up to the house,\" replied Glyn coolly, \"to our dormitory.\"  \"That you are not,\" cried Burney.  \"The rules say that the fellows are not to go up to their rooms between hours, and you have been here long enough to know that.  Now then, no nonsense.  Here, you, Singh, you've got to come and field while old Slegge practises batting, and Tompkins has got to bowl.\"  As the boy spoke in an unpleasant dictatorial way he made a thrust at Singh with the pointed stump he held; but quick as thought and before it was driven home, this third-part of a wicket was wrenched from his hand by Severn and sent flying through the air.  \"How dare you!\" shouted Burney, and he made a rush at Glyn to collar him and make him prisoner; but before he could reach the offending lad a foot was thrust out by Singh, over which he tripped and fell sprawling upon his face.  \"Oh!\" he shouted, half-beside himself with rage; and, scrambling up, he made a rush with clenched fists at the two boys, who now stood perfectly still awaiting his onslaught.  It was a thoroughly angry charge, but not a charge home; for Burney stopped some three or four yards short of the distance, with his rage evaporating fast and beginning to feel quite discreet.  For quite a minute the opponents stood gazing fiercely, and then what had threatened to become a cuffing encounter became verbal.  \"Look here,\" cried Burney, \"you two will get it for this.  What am I to say to the captain?\"  \"Tell him to bowl for himself,\" said Singh sharply.  \"Here!  Hi!  Burney, bring 'em along!\" came from across the field and from between Slegge's hands.  \"Tell these beggars they had better not keep me waiting much longer!\"  \"All right!\" shouted back Burney; and then to the two lads, \"There, you hear.  Come on at once, and as you are new chaps I won't tell on you. You had better come, or he'll pay you out by keeping you on bowling so that you can't go and see the show.\"  \"Yes,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Go back and tell him what Singh said.\"  \"What!\" cried Burney, staring with wonder.  \"Tell the captain he's to bowl for himself?\"  \"Yes,\" said Glyn coolly, \"as long as he likes.--Come along, Singh;\" and, throwing his arm over his Indian companion's shoulder, the two lads fell into military step and marched slowly towards the Doctor's mansion-like house.  \"I am afraid it means a fight, Singh,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Well, I dare say we can get over it.  I am not going to knuckle down to that fellow. Are you?\"  \"Am I?\" cried the boy, flashing a fierce look at his English companion. \"What do you think?\"  Glyn laughed softly and merrily.  \"Shall I tell you?\" he said.  \"Yes, of course,\" cried the Indian boy hotly.  \"Well, I think you will.\"  \"What!\"  \"When you can't lift hand or foot, and your eyes are closing up so as you can hardly see.\"  \"And I won't give up then!\" cried the boy passionately.  \"Well, don't get into a wax about it, old chap,\" said Glyn in a dry, slow way.  \"I don't suppose you'll have to, for the big chuckle-headed bully will have to lick me first, and I dare say I can manage to tire him so that you can easily lick him in turn.\"  \"You are not going to fight him,\" cried Singh hotly.  \"Yes, I am.\"  \"You are not.  He insulted my dead father.  A mahout indeed!\"  \"So he did mine,\" said Glyn.  \"A shabby half-pay military officer indeed!  I'll make _him_ look shabby before I have done.\"  \"Now, look here,\" cried Singh, \"don't be a beast, Glynny, and make me more angry than I am.  I am bad enough as it is.\"  \"So am I, so don't you get putting on the Indian tyrant.  Recollect you are in England now.  This is my job, and I know if father were here he'd say I was to have the first go in.  He's such a big fellow that I believe he'll lick me easily.  But, as I said before, I shall pretty well tire him out, and then you being the reserve, he'll come at you, and then he'll find out his mistake.  And I say, Singhy, old chap, I do hope that my eyes won't be so closed that I can't see.  Now then, come up to our room.  It's a holiday, and the rules won't count to-day.  Come on, and we'll talk it over.\"  \"But--\" began Singh.  \"Now, don't be obstinate.  You promised father you'd try and give way to me over English matters.  Now, didn't you?\"  \"Well,\" said the lad hesitatingly, \"I suppose I did.\"  \"Come on, then.  You see war's begun, and we have got to settle our plan of campaign.\"  The young Maharajah nodded his head and smiled.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"come up to our room.  We ought to dress, oughtn't we, to see the procession?  I say, I don't know how it is, I always like fighting against any one who tries to bully.  I am not sorry that war has begun.\"  \"Neither am I,\" said the English lad quietly, \"for things have been very unpleasant ever since we came here, and when we've got this over perhaps we shall be at peace.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  THE PRINCE'S REGALIA.  The bedroom shared by Glyn Severn and Singh was one of a series, small and particularly comfortable, in the new annexe the Doctor had built expressly for lecture-room and dormitories when his establishment began to increase.  The comfortably furnished room just sufficed for two narrow beds and the customary furniture; and as soon as the two lads had entered, Singh hurried to his chest of drawers, unlocked one, took out a second bunch of keys to that he carried in his pocket, and was then crossing to a sea-going portmanteau standing in one corner, when Glyn, who was looking very thoughtful and abstracted, followed, and as Singh knelt down and threw open the travelling-case, laid his hand upon the lad's shoulder. \"What are you going to do?\" he said shortly.  \"Only look out two or three things that there's not room for in the drawer.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Why, to dress for the procession.\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!  You are quite right as you are,\" cried Glyn half-mockingly.  \"You must learn to remember that you are in England, where nobody dresses up except soldiers.  Why, what were you going to do?\"  \"I was going to put on a white suit and belt.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Glyn.  \"This isn't India, but Devonshire.  Why, if you were to come down dressed like that the boys would all laugh at you, and the crowd out in the road shout and cheer.\"  \"Well, of course,\" said Singh; \"they'd see I was a prince.\"  \"Oh, what a rum fellow you are!\" cried Glyn, gripping his companion's shoulders and laughingly shaking him to and fro.  \"I thought that I had made you understand that now we are over here you were to dress just the same as an English boy.  Why, don't you know that when we had a king in England he used to dress just like any ordinary gentleman, only sometimes he would wear a star on his breast.\"  \"Oh, but surely,\" began Singh, in a disappointed tone, \"he must have--\"  \"Yes, yes, yes; sometimes,\" cried Glyn.  \"I know what you mean.  On state occasions, or when he went to review troops, he would wear grand robes or a field-marshal's uniform.\"  \"But didn't he wear his crown?\"  \"No,\" cried Glyn, bursting out laughing.  \"That's only put on for a little while when he's made king.\"  \"What does he do with it, then, at other times?\"  \"Nothing,\" cried Glyn merrily.  \"It's kept shut up in a glass case at the Tower, for people to go and see.\"  \"England seems a queer place,\" said Singh quietly.  \"Very,\" cried Glyn drily.  \"You never want those Indian clothes, and you ought to have done as I told you--left them behind.\"  \"But the Colonel didn't say so,\" replied the boy warmly.  \"He said that some day he might take me with him to Court.  It was when "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],["title","Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#3)"],["body","asked him for the emeralds.\"  \"What do you mean--the belt?\" said Glyn quickly.  \"Yes.\"  \"You never told me that you had got them.\"  \"No; the Colonel said that I was not to make a fuss about them nor show them to people, but keep them locked up in the case.  Here they are,\" cried the boy; and, thrusting down one hand, he drew from beneath some folded garments a small flat scarlet morocco case, which he opened by pressing a spring, and drew out from where it lay neatly doubled, a gold-embroidered waistbelt of some soft yellow leather, whose fastening was formed of a gold clasp covered by a large flat emerald, two others of similar shape being arranged so that when the belt was fastened round the waist they lay on either side.  It was a magnificent piece of ornamentation, but barbaric, and such as would be worn by an Indian prince.  Apparently it was of great value, for the largest glittering green stone was fully two inches in length and an inch and a half wide, the others being about half the size, and all three engraved with lines of large Arabic characters, so that either stone could have been utilised as a gigantic seal.  \"I don't see why one shouldn't wear a thing like this,\" said Singh.  \"My father always used to wear it out at home wherever he went, even when he wore nothing else but a long white muslin robe.  On grand Court days he would be covered with jewels, and his turban was full of diamonds.\"  \"Yes,\" said Glyn drily and with a half-contemptuous smile upon his lips; \"but that was in India, where all the rajahs and princes wear such things.\"  \"Well,\" said the boy proudly, \"I am still a maharajah, even if I have come to England to be educated; so why shouldn't I put on a belt like this on a grand day if I like?\"  Glyn took the brilliant belt from his companion's hand and held it towards the light, inspecting curiously the beautiful gems, which were of a lustrous green marked with flaws.  \"Ah,\" he said, \"it looks nice, and is worth a lot of money I suppose.\"  \"Of course,\" said the young Indian; and he added haughtily, \"I shouldn't wear it if it were not.\"  \"Well, you can't wear it,\" said Glyn, passing the embroidered leather through his hands and turning it over in the bright sunlight which came through the window.  \"But why?\" cried Singh, frowning slightly at having his will challenged.  \"Well,\" said Glyn, \"first of all, as I told you, because the boys would laugh at you.\"  \"They dare not,\" cried the boy proudly.  \"What!\" cried Glyn laughing.  \"Why, English boys dare do anything.  What did Slegge say this morning?\"  \"Slegge is what you call a blackguard,\" cried Singh angrily.  \"Well, he isn't nice certainly,\" said Glyn; \"but he'd begin at you again directly, and chaff, and say that you ought to ride on the elephant.\"  \"Well,\" said the boy, \"and that would be my place if there were a howdah.  Of course I shouldn't ride on the great brute's neck.\"  \"Yes, in India; but can't you recollect that you are still in England?\"  \"Of course I can,\" cried the boy, with flashing eyes; \"but I can't forget that I am a prince.\"  \"Now, look here,\" said Glyn, \"what did dad say to you when the Doctor left us with him in the drawing-room?  I mean before father went away. Have you forgotten?\"  \"Of course not.  He said, `Never mind about being a prince.  Be content with the rank of an English gentleman till you go back to your own country.'  And that's what I am going to do.\"  \"Well done,\" cried Glyn merrily.  \"Then, now, put this thing away; you don't want it.  But stop a moment.  I never had a close look at it before.\"  \"No; the Colonel told me to keep it locked up and not to go showing it about so as to tempt some _budmash_ to steal it.\"  \"Well, we haven't got any _budmashes_ in England,\" said Glyn merrily, as he began to inspect the emeralds again and took out his handkerchief to rub off a finger-mark or two and make the gems send off scintillations of sunlight which formed jack-o'-lanterns on the ceiling.  \"But we have plenty of blackguards who would like to get a chance to carry it off.\"  \"What, among our schoolfellows?\" cried Singh hastily.  \"Bah!  No!  There, put it away.  But I should like to know what that writing means.\"  \"It's out of the Koran,\" said the boy as he took the jewelled belt back reverently and held it up to the light in turn.  \"It's very, very old, and means greatness to my family.  It is a holy relic, and the Maharajahs of Dour have worn that in turn for hundreds of years.\"  \"Well, you put it away,\" said Glyn; \"and I wouldn't show it to anybody again, nor yet talk about it.  I wonder the dad let you have it.\"  \"Why?\" said Singh proudly.  \"It is mine.\"  \"Yes, of course; but it is not suited for a boy like you.\"  \"A boy like me!\" cried Singh half--angrily.  \"Why, I am as old as you.\"  \"Well, I know that; but my father doesn't give me emeralds and diamonds to take with me to school.  He could, though, if he liked, for he's got all those beautiful Indian jewels the Maharajah gave him.\"  \"Yes,\" said Singh, \"and that diamond--hilted tulwar.\"  \"Yes, that's a grand sword,\" cried Glyn, with his eyes sparkling.  \"I should like to have that.\"  Singh laughed mockingly.  \"Why, you are as bad as I am,\" he cried.  \"That I am not!  Why, if I had it, do you think I should buckle it on to go and see a country wild-beast show?\"  \"Well, no, I don't suppose you would,\" said Singh quietly, as he gravely replaced the emeralds in their receptacle and curled the belt around them before shutting down the velvet-lined and quilted cover with a loud snap.  \"But some day, when we have both grown older, and we are back in India--I mean when I am at home in state and you are one of my officers--you will have to get the Colonel to let you wear it then.\"  \"Ah,\" said Glyn, slowly and thoughtfully, \"some day; but that's a long time off.  I suppose I shall be a soldier like the dad is, and in your army.\"  \"Why, of course,\" cried Singh.  \"You will be my greatest general, just the same as your father was when mine was alive.  He was always a great general there, though he was only colonel in the Company's army.  There, I suppose you are right.  I like to look at that belt, but I won't show it about; but I say, Glyn, I shall be glad when we get older and have both begun learning to be--no, what do you call it?--not learning--I mean, being taught to be soldiers.\"  \"Training,\" said Glyn.  \"Yes, training--that's it; and we shall go together to that place where your father was, not far from London.  You know--the place he used to talk to us about, where he was trained before he came out to India.\"  \"Addiscombe,\" said Glyn quietly, as he stood watching his companion thrust the case back into the bottom of the portmanteau and rearrange the garments he had moved, while his hand lingered for a few moments about a soft white robe, which he covered over with a sigh before closing the lid and turning the key of the great leather case.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"Addiscombe.  What stories he used to tell us about the young officers there!  What did he call them?  I forget.\"  \"Cadets,\" said Glyn thoughtfully.  \"That's it.  I wish I didn't forget so many of those English words; but,\" continued the boy, \"I liked it best when he told us about the battles out at home, when all the chiefs around were fighting against my father the Maharajah, so as to slay him and divide his possessions.  You know, my father has talked about it to me as well--how he was so nearly beaten and weakened, and so many of his bravest officers killed, that it made him apply to the great Company for help, and they sent your father. Oh, what a brave man he was!\"  \"Who said that?\" cried Glyn, flushing up.  \"My father the Maharajah.  He said so to me many times, and that he was his best and truest friend.  Oh yes, I used to like to hear about it all, and he used to tell me that the Colonel would always be my truest friend as well, and that I was to love him and obey him, and always believe that what he told me to do was right.  And I always do.\"  \"Of course you do,\" said Glyn flushing.  \"Yes, Singh, he is some one to be proud of, isn't he?  But I am like you; I don't much like coming to this school, though the Doctor is very nice and kind to us both.\"  \"Yes, I like him better than the masters,\" said Singh; \"but I don't like the boys, and I don't think they like me.\"  \"Oh, wait a bit,\" said Glyn.  \"It's because everything seems so different to being in India; but, as father says, there is such a lot one ought to learn, and we shall get used to it by-and-by; only, I say, you know what the dad said?\"  \"You mean about trying to be an English gentle man and leaving the maharajah till I get back home?\"  \"Yes, that's it,\" cried Glyn eagerly.  \"Yes; but it's hard work, for everything is so different here, and the boys are not like you.\"  \"Oh yes, they are,\" cried Glyn merrily; \"just the same.  Here, come on; let's go down and see whether Wrench has put up those forms by the wall. We want to see the show.\"  \"Yes,\" cried Singh.  \"It puts one in mind of Dour again, and I have been thinking that we don't get on with the other boys through me.\"  \"What do you mean with your `through me'?\" said Glyn.  \"Well, I don't quite know.  It's because I am an Indian, I suppose; and when they talk to me as they do, and bully me, as you call it, it makes my heart feel hot and as if I should like to do something strange.  But I am going to try.  And look here, Glyn,\" said the lad very seriously, \"I shall begin at once.\"  \"Begin what?\"  \"Trying to make them like me.  I shall make friends with that big fellow Slegge, and bear it all, and if he goes on again like he did this morning I have quite made up my mind I won't fight.\"  \"Oh,\" said Glyn drily.  \"Well, come on down the grounds now.  We shall see.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.
