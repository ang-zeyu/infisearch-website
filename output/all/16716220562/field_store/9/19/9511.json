Magruder had commanded the Confederate troops at Yorktown which opposed M'Clellan's advance. He told me the different dodges he had resorted to, to blind and deceive the latter as to his (Magruder's) strength; and he spoke of the intense relief and amusement with which he had at length seen M'Clellan with his magnified army begin to break ground before miserable earthworks, defended only by 8000 men. Hooker was in his regiment, and was \"essentially a mean man and a liar.\" Of Lee and Longstreet he spoke in terms of the highest admiration.  Magruder was an artilleryman, and has been a good deal in Europe; and having been much stationed on the Canadian frontier, he became acquainted with many British officers, particularly those in the 7th Hussars and Guards.  He had gained much credit from his recent successes at Galveston and Sabine Pass, in which he had the temerity to attack heavily-armed vessels of war with wretched river steamers manned by Texan cavalrymen.  His principal reason for visiting Brownsville was to settle about the cotton trade. He had issued an edict that half the value of cotton exported must be imported in goods for the benefit of the country (government stores). The President had condemned this order as illegal and despotic.  The officers on Magruder's Staff are a very good-looking, gentlemanlike set of men. Their names are--Major Pendleton, Major Wray, Captain De Pont√©, Captain Alston, Captain Turner, Lieutenant-Colonel M'Neil, Captain Dwyer, Dr Benien, Lieutenant Stanard, Lieutenant Yancey, and Major Magruder. The latter is nephew to the General, and is a particularly good-looking young fellow. They all live with their chief on an extremely agreeable footing, and form a very pleasant society. At dinner I was put in the post of honour, which is always fought for with much acrimony--viz., the right of Mrs ----. After dinner we had numerous songs. Both the General and his nephew sang; so also did Captain Alston, whose corpulent frame, however, was too much for the feeble camp-stool, which caused his sudden disappearance in the midst of a song with a loud crash. Captain Dwyer played the fiddle very well, and an aged and slightly-elevated militia general brewed the punch and made several \"elegant\" speeches. The latter was a rough-faced old hero, and gloried in the name of M'Guffin. On these festive occasions General Magruder wears a red woollen cap, and fills the president's chair with great aptitude.  It was 11.30 before I could tear myself away from this agreeable party; but at length I effected my exit amidst a profusion of kind expressions, and laden with heaps of letters of introduction.         *       *       *       *       *  _16th April_ (Thursday).--Now our troubles commenced. Seated in Mexican saddles, and mounted on raw-boned mustangs, whose energy had been a good deal impaired by a month's steady travelling on bad food, M'Carthy and I left the hospitable mess-tent about midnight, and started in search of Mr Sargent and his vehicle. We were under the guidance of two Texan rangers.  About daylight we hove in sight of \"Los Animos,\" a desolate farmhouse, in the neighbourhood of which Mr Sargent was supposed to be encamped; but nowhere could we find any traces of him.  We had now reached the confines of a dreary region, sixty miles in extent, called \"The Sands,\" in comparison with which the prairie and chaparal were luxurious.  The sand being deep and the wind high, we could not trace the carriage; but we soon acquired a certainty that our perfidious Jehu had decamped, leaving us behind.  We floundered about in the sand, cursing our bad luck, cursing Mr Sargent, and even the good Magruder, as the indirect cause of our wretchedness. Our situation, indeed, was sufficiently deplorable. We were without food or water in the midst of a desert: so were our horses, which were nearly done up. Our bones ached from the Mexican saddles; and, to complete our misery, the two rangers began to turn restive and talk of returning with the horses. At this, the climax of our misfortunes, I luckily hit upon a Mexican, who gave us intelligence of our carriage; and with renewed spirits, but very groggy horses, we gave chase.  But never did Mr Sargent's mules walk at such a pace; and it was 9 A.M. before we overtook them. My animal had been twice on his head, and M'Carthy was green in the face with fatigue and rage. Mr Sargent received us with the greatest affability; and we were sensible enough not to quarrel with him, although M'Carthy had made many allusions as to the advisability of shooting him.  We had been nine and a half hours in the saddle, and were a good deal exhausted. Our sulky Texan guides were appeased with bacon, coffee, and $5 in coin.  We halted till 2 P.M., and then renewed our struggle through the deep sandy wilderness; but though the services of the Judge's horse were put into requisition, we couldn't progress faster than two miles an hour.  Mule-driving is an art of itself, and Mr Sargent is justly considered a _professor_ at it.  He is always yelling--generally imprecations of a serio-comic character. He rarely flogs his mules; but when one of them rouses his indignation by extraordinary laziness, he roars out, \"Come here, Judge, with a big club, and give him h----ll.\" Whilst the animal is receiving such discipline as comes up to the judge's idea of the infernal regions, Mr Sargent generally remarks, \"I wish you was Uncle Abe, I'd make you move, you G----d d----n son of a ----.\" His idea of perfect happiness seems to be to have Messrs Lincoln and Seward in the shafts. Mules travel much better when other mules are in front of them; and another dodge to which Mr Sargent continually resorts is, to beat the top of the carriage and kick the foot-board, which makes a noise, and gratifies the mules quite as much as licking them. Mr Sargent accounts for his humanity by saying, \"It's the worst plan in the world licking niggers or mules, because the more you licks 'em, the more they wants it.\"  We reached or \"struck\" water at 5.30 P.M.; but, in spite of its good reputation, it was so salt as to be scarcely drinkable. A number of cotton waggons, and three carriages belonging to Mr Ward, were also encamped with us.  We have only made sixteen miles to-day.         *       *       *       *       *  _17th April_ (Friday).--Having spent last night in a Mexican saddle, our bullock-rug in the sand appeared to me a most luxurious bed.  We hitched in at 5 A.M., and struck water at 9 A.M., which, though muddy in appearance, was not so bad to drink.  I walked ahead with the Judge, who, when sober, is a well-informed and sensible man. Mr Sargent and I are great friends, and, rough as he is, we get on capitally together.  A Mr Ward, with three vehicles--a rival of Mr Sargent's--is travelling in our company. He drove his buggy against a tree and knocked its top off, to the intense delight of the latter.  We breakfasted under difficulties. The wind being high, it drove up the sand in clouds and spoiled our food.  Our travelling companion, Mr ----, is a poor little weakly Israelite, but very inoffensive, although he speaks with a horrible Yankee twang, which Mr Sargent and the Judge are singularly free from.  We went on again at 2 P.M. I had a long talk with a big mulatto slave woman, who was driving one of Ward's waggons. She told me she had been raised in Tennessee, and that three years ago she had been taken from her mistress for a bad debt, to their mutual sorrow. \"Both,\" she said, \"cried bitterly at parting.\" She doesn't like San Antonio at all, \"too much hanging and murdering for me,\" she said. She had seen a man hanged in the middle of the day, just in front of her door.  Mr Sargent bought two chickens and some eggs at a ranch, but one of the chickens got up a tree, and was caught and eaten by the Ward faction. Our camp to-night looks very pretty by the light of the fires.         *       *       *       *       *  _18th April_ (Saturday).--At daylight we discovered, to our horror, that three of our mules were absent; but after an hour's search they were brought back in triumph by the Judge.  This delayed our start till 6.30 A.M.  I walked ahead again with the Judge, who explained to me that he was a \"senator,\" or member of the Upper House of Texas--\"just like your House of Lords,\" he said. He gets $5 a-day whilst sitting, and is elected for four years.[8]  We struck water at 8.30 A.M., and bought a lamb for a dollar. We also bought some beef, which in this country is dried in strips by the sun, after being cut off the bullock, and it keeps good for any length of time. To cook it, the strips are thrown for a few minutes on hot embers.  One of our mules was kicked last night. Mr Sargent rubbed the wound with brandy, which did it much good.  Soon after leaving this well, Mr Sargent discovered that, by following the track of Mr Ward's waggons, he had lost the way. He swore dreadfully, and solaced himself with so much gin, that when we arrived at Sulphur Creek at 12.30, both he and the Judge were, by their own confession, _quite tight_.  We halted, ate some salt meat, and bathed in this creek, which is about forty yards broad and three feet deep.  Mr Sargent's extreme \"tightness\" caused him to fall asleep on the box when we started again, but the more seasoned Judge drove the mules.  The signs of getting out of the sands now began to be apparent; and at 5 P.M. we were able to halt at a very decent place with grass, but _no water_. We suffered here for want of water, our stock being very nearly expended.  Mr Sargent, who was now comparatively sober, killed the sheep most scientifically at 5.30 P.M.; and at 6.30 we were actually devouring it, and found it very good. Mr Sargent cooked it by the simple process of stewing junks of it in a frying-pan, but we had only just enough water to do this.  [8] I was afterwards told that the Judge's term of service had expired."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20928"],["title","Three Months in the Southern States, April-June 1863 (#5)"],["body"," Paso was his district.         *       *       *       *       *  _19th April_ (Sunday).--At 1 A.M. this morning, our slumbers on the bullock-rug were disturbed by a sudden and most violent thunderstorm. M'Carthy and I had only just time to rush into the carriage, and hustle our traps underneath it, when the rain began to descend in torrents.  We got inside with the little Jew (who was much alarmed by the thunder); whilst Mr Sargent and the Judge crept underneath.  The rain lasted two hours; and at daylight we were able to refresh ourselves by drinking the water from the puddles, and effect a start.  But fate seemed adverse to our progress. No sooner had we escaped from the sand than we fell into the mud, which was still worse.  We toiled on till 11.30 A.M., at which hour we reached \"_King's Ranch_,\" which for several days I had heard spoken of as a sort of Elysium, marking as it does the termination of the sands, and the commencement of comparative civilisation.  We halted in front of the house, and after cooking and eating, I walked up to the \"ranch,\" which is a comfortable, well-furnished wooden building.  Mr and Mrs King had gone to Brownsville; but we were received by Mrs Bee, the wife of the Brownsville general, who had heard I was on the road.  She is a nice lively little woman, a red-hot Southerner, glorying in the facts that she has no Northern relations or friends, and that she is a member of the Church of England.  Mr King first came to Texas as a steamboat captain, but now owns an immense tract of country, with 16,000 head of cattle, situated, however, in a wild and almost uninhabited district. King's Ranch is distant from Brownsville only 125 miles, and we have been six days in reaching it.  After drying our clothes and our food after the rain of last night, we started again at 2.30 P.M.  We now entered a boundless and most fertile prairie, upon which, as far as the eye could reach, cattle were feeding.  Bulls and cows, horses and mares, came to stare at us as we passed. They all seemed sleek and in good condition, yet they get nothing but what they can pick up on the prairie.  I saw a man on horseback kill a rabbit with his revolver. I also saw a scorpion for the first time.  We halted at 5.30 P.M., and had to make our fire principally of cow-dung, as wood is very scarce on this prairie.  We gave up the Judge's horse at King's Ranch. The lawgiver now rides on the box with Mr Sargent.         *       *       *       *       *  _20th April_ (Monday).--I slept well last night in spite of the numerous prairie-wolves which surrounded us, making a most dismal noise.  The Jew was ill again, but both Mr Sargent and the Judge were very kind to him; so also was M'Carthy, who declared that a person incapable of protecting himself, and sickly, such as this little Jew, is always sure of kind treatment and compassion, even from the wildest Texans.  We started at 5 A.M., and had to get through some dreadful mud--Mr Sargent in an awful bad humour, and using terrific language.  We were much delayed by this unfortunate rain, which had converted a good road into a quagmire. We detected a rattlesnake crawling along this morning but there are not nearly so many of them in this country as there used to be.  We halted at 9 A.M., and, to make a fire for cooking, we set a rat-ranch alight, which answered very well; but one big rat, annoyed by our proceedings, emerged hastily from his den, and very nearly jumped into the frying-pan.  Two Texan rangers, belonging to Taylor's regiment, rode up to us whilst we were at breakfast. These rangers all wear the most enormous spurs I ever saw.  We resumed our journey at 12.30, and reached a creek[9] called \"Agua Dulce\" at 2 P.M. M'Carthy and I got out before crossing to forage at some huts close by. We got two dozen eggs and some lard; but, on returning to the road, we found that Mr Sargent had pursued his usual plan of leaving us in the lurch.  I luckily was able to get hold of a Mexican boy, and rode across the creek _en croupe_. M'Carthy dismounted a negro, and so got over.  We halted at 5 P.M.  After dark M'Carthy crossed the prairie to visit some friends who were encamped half a mile distant. He lost his way in returning, and wandered about for several hours. The Judge, with great presence of mind, kept the fire up, and he found us at last.  The heat from nine to two is pretty severe; but in Texas there is generally a cool sea-breeze, which makes it bearable.  [9] All streams or rivers are called creeks, and pronounced \"criks.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _21st April_ (Tuesday).--We started at 5 A.M., and reached a hamlet called \"Casa Blanca\" at 6. We procured a kid, some Indian corn, and two fowls in this neighbourhood.  We had now quitted the flat country, and entered an undulating or \"rolling\" country, full of live oaks of very respectable size, and we had also got out of the mud.  Mr Sargent and the Judge got drunk again about 8 A.M., which, however, had a beneficial effect upon the speed. We descended the hills at a terrific pace--or, as Mr Sargent expressed it, \"_Going like h----ll a-beating tan bark_.\"  We \"nooned it\" at a small creek; and after unhitching, Mr Sargent and the Judge had a row with one another, after which Mr Sargent killed and cooked the goat, using my knife for these operations. With all his faults he certainly is a capital butcher, cook, and mule-driver. He takes great care of his animals, and is careful to inform us that the increased pace we have been going at is not attributable to gin.  He was very complimentary to me, because I acted as assistant cook and butcher.  Mr Ward's party passed us about 1 P.M. The front wheels of his buggy having now smashed, it is hitched in rear of one of the waggons.  We made a pretty good afternoon's drive through a wood of post oaks, where we saw another rattlesnake, which we tried to shoot.  We halted at Spring creek at 6.30 P.M.; water rather brackish, and no grass for the mules.  The Judge gave us some of his experiences as a filibuster. He declares that a well-cooked polecat is as good to eat as a pig, and that stewed rattlesnake is not so bad as might be supposed. The Texans call the Mexicans \"greasers,\" the latter retort by the name \"gringo.\"  We are now living luxuriously upon eggs and goat's flesh; and I think we have made about thirty-two miles to-day.         *       *       *       *       *  _22d April_ (Wednesday).--We got under weigh at 5 A.M., the mules looking rather mean for want of grass.  At 8 A.M. we reached the Nueces river, the banks of which are very steep, and are bordered with a beautiful belt of live oak-trees, covered with mustang grapes.  On the other side of the Nueces is \"Oakville,\" a miserable settlement, consisting of about twenty wooden huts. We bought some butter there, and caught up Ward's waggons. The women at Oakville were most anxious to buy snuff. It appears that the Texan females are in the habit of dipping snuff--which means, putting it into their mouths instead of their noses. They rub it against their teeth with a blunted stick.  We reached grass about 10 A.M., and \"nooned it,\" the weather being very trying--very sultry, without sun or wind.  We hitched in at 1.15--Ward's waggons in our front, and a Frenchman's four-horse team in our rear. At 4 P.M. we reached the \"Weedy,\" a creek which, to our sorrow, was perfectly dry. We drove on till 7 P.M., and halted at some good grass. There being a report of water in the neighbourhood, Mr Sargent, the Judge, Ward, and the Frenchman, started to explore; and when, at length, they did discover a wretched little mud-hole, it appears that a desperate conflict for the water ensued, for the Judge returned to us a mass of mud, and presenting a very crestfallen appearance. Shortly after, Mr Sargent appeared, in such a bad humour that he declined to cook, to eat, to drink, or do anything but swear vehemently.  Deprived by this contretemps of our goat's flesh we had recourse to an old ham and very stale bread.  We met many cotton trains and government waggons to-day, and I think we have progressed about thirty-four miles.         *       *       *       *       *  _23d April_ (Thursday).--The wily Mr Sargent drove the animals down to the mud-hole in the middle of last night, and so stole a march upon Ward.  Our goat's flesh having spoiled, had to be thrown away this morning. We started at 5.30 A.M., and reached \"Rocky\" at 7.30; but before this two of Ward's horses had \"_caved in_,\" which completely restored our driver's good-humour.  Rocky consists of two huts in the midst of a stony country; and about a mile beyond it we reached a pond, watered our mules, and filled our barrels. The water was very muddy to look at, but not bad to drink.  The mules were lazy to-day; and Mr Sargent was forced to fill his bucket with stones, and pelt the leaders occasionally.  At 8 A.M. we reached an open, undulating prairie, and halted at 10.30. Mr Sargent and I killed and cooked the two chickens.  He has done me the honour to call me a \"right good companion for the road.\" He also told me that at one time he kept a hotel at El Paso--a sort of half-way house on the overland route to California--and was rapidly making his fortune when the war totally ruined him. This accounts for his animosity to \"Uncle Abe.\"[10]  We hitched in again at 3 P.M., and after pushing through some deepish sand, we halted for the night only twenty-four miles from San Antonio. No corn or water, but plenty of grass; our food, also, was now entirely expended. Mr Ward struggled up at 8.15, making a desperate effort to keep up with us, and this rivalry between Sargent and him was of great service.  This was our last night of camping out, and I felt almost sorry for it, for I have enjoyed the journey in spite of the hardships. The country through which I have passed would be most fertile and productive (at least the last 150 miles), were it not for the great irregularity of"]]]
