The girls have gone up, I suppose.\"  \"Wait a moment, Patty,\" and Van Reypen appeared in the doorway from the sun-parlour, where the two men had been sitting, \"wait a moment, I want to speak to you.\"  \"Not tonight, Phil, please.  I'm very tired.\"  \"You ought to be tired!  Staying till all hours with that bunch of trash!  I'm ashamed of you!\"  Patty was thoroughly angry.  It took a good deal to make good-natured Patty angry, but when her temper was roused, it meant a tempest.  Also, she was worn out mentally and physically and, more than all, she resented Philip's assumption of authority.  Her blue eyes flashed, and a spot of pink came into each cheek, as she replied: \"It is not of the slightest interest to me whether you are ashamed of me or not!  You are in no way responsible for my actions and you have no right to reprove or criticise me.  I may have broken the conventions of hospitality, but that is between me and Mrs. Farrington. Your opinion of me means nothing to me whatever!  Good night, Roger.\"  Patty held out her hand to Roger, who took it for a moment, with a smiling good night, and then, with the air of an offended queen, Patty swept upstairs and entered her own room.  There she found Mona and Elise, one asleep on the couch, the other rubbing her eyes as she sat up in a big easy-chair.  \"Goodness, Patty!\" said Mona, looking at the clock, \"what _have_ you been up to?\"  Elise blinked and shook herself awake.  \"We had to wait up to see you,\" she said, \"so we waited here.\"  \"I see you did,\" returned Patty, lightly.  \"And now your wait is over, and you've seen me, shall us say good night?\"  \"Not much we won't!\" declared Elise, now broad awake.  \"Tell us everything about it!  What did you do there all this time?  What did Phil say?  Who brought you home?  Do you like that crowd?  How can you? They bore me to death!  Oh, Patty, you're going to cry!\"  \"I am,\" declared Patty, and the tears gathered thickly in her eyes. \"I'm all in, and I'm down and out, and I'm mad as hops, and I'm tired, and I _am_ going to cry.  Now, if you've any sense of common humanity, you'll know enough to go away and let me alone!\"  \"Can I help?\" asked Mona, looking commiseratingly at Patty.  \"No,\" and Patty smiled through the fast-flooding tears.  \"I never need help to cry!\"  \"Come on, then,\" and Mona took Elise by the arm and led her away, as they heard Patty's door locked behind them.  Now, most girls would have thrown themselves down on the pillows to have their cry out, but Patty was too methodical for that.  \"I can't cry comfortably in this rig,\" she said to herself, beginning to take off the chiffon gown.  And it was with tears still unshed that she finally sat at her dressing-table plaiting her hair for the night.  \"And after all,\" she remarked to her reflection in the mirror, \"I only want to cry 'cause I'm tired and worn out and--yes, and mad!  I'm mad at Philip, and I'm going to stay mad!  He has no right to talk to me like a Dutch uncle!  My own father never spoke to me like that!  The idea!  I just simply, plain won't stand it, and that's all there is about that!\"  And so, after Patty was snugly in bed, cuddled beneath the comforting down coverlet, she let herself go, and cried to her heart's content; great, soul-satisfying sobs that quieted her throbbing pulses and exhausted her strained nerves, until she fell asleep from sheer weariness.  And next morning she awoke, smiling.  Everything looked bright and cheery.  The sun shone in at her windows, and as she felt somebody pinching her toes through the blankets, she opened her eyes to see Mona sitting on the edge of the bed and Elise just coming in at the door. Mrs. Farrington followed, and Patty sat up in bed with a smiling welcome for all.  \"Hello, you dear things!\" she cried.  \"You first, Mrs. Farrington.  I want to 'fess up to you.  I was baddy girl last night, and I stayed at the party much later than I meant to, or than I knew, until I suddenly realised the time.  Am I forguv?  Oh, do say yes, and _don't_ scold me!\"  Pretty Patty possessed herself of the lady's hand and looked so penitent and so wheedlesome that Mrs. Farrington was disarmed.  \"Why, of course, dear; it was not really wrong, but young girls ought to be home by midnight at latest, I think,--and too, ought to come home with their own people.\"  \"I know it, Mrs. Farrington, I do know it.  I have been brought up right--honest, I have.  But it was a special occasion, you see, and, too, my own people ran off and left me.\"  \"Oh, now, Patty,\" began Elise, \"Sam said you sent word for us to do so.\"  \"Well, I didn't exactly do that, but I did want to stay longer.  Oh, Mrs. Farrington, you've no idea how interesting those psychic souls are----\"  \"What!\"  \"Yes, they're psychic, you know----\"  \"And what are psychics,--clearly, now, Patty, what _are_ psychics?\"  \"Why, they're----they're----\"  \"Yes, go on.\"  \"Well, they're--why, they're _psychics_!  That's what they are.\"  \"Patty, you're an irresistible little goose!\" and Mrs. Farrington bent down to kiss the pretty, flushed face, and then laughingly declared she had no more time to waste on psychics, and trailed away.  \"Now, tell us all about it, Patsy,\" said Elise.  \"I shan't let you get up till you do.\"  \"There's not much to tell, Elise; but I liked to learn about the things they were talking about and so I stayed later than I should have.  But since your mother is so lovely about it, I don't care what any one else says.\"  \"Oh, pshaw,--your staying late,--that was nothing.  But what did they do over there so interesting?  I can't see any sense in their talk.\"  \"I can't see much myself, and that's why I want to learn.  I'm awfully ignorant of higher ethics,--and--things like that.\"  \"Higher ethics?  H--m.  Is it sort of Uplift ideas?\"  \"No, not that exactly.\"  \"Fudge, you don't know what it is, 'exactly,' and between you and me, I don't think you have the glimmer of a ghost of an idea what it is all about!  Now, have you?\"  \"If I had, I couldn't make you understand!  You're antagonistic.  You have to be receptive and responsive and----\"  \"Patty, you're a goose!  A silly idiot of a goose!  But such a dear, pretty little goose, that with all your faults we love you still!  Now, I'll scoot, and you get dressed, for we're going somewhere today.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Never you mind, Miss Curiosity.  Just put on a house dress and come down to breakfast, and you'll find out.\"  Elise ran away, but Mona lingered.  \"Patty,\" she said, a little gravely, \"Philip is terribly upset about last night.\"  \"I don't care if he is, Mona.  He has no right to be.  He has no authority over me.\"  \"What!  When you've become engaged to him?\"  \"I'm not engaged to him at all.\"  \"He says you are.\"  \"Did he really say that, Mona?\"  \"Not in so many words, but he implied that there was an understanding between you.\"  \"Understanding!  I hate that word,--used that way!  There's a misunderstanding between us, if there's anything!\"  \"But you're going to be engaged to him, aren't you, Patty?\"  \"No, I don't think so.  Not after last night.  Why, he was horrid, Mona, after I came home.  He scolded me, and I wouldn't stay to listen. I ran upstairs.\"  \"Oh, Patty, I wish you'd make up with him, and be friends again, and be engaged to him, and announce it at my wedding.\"  \"Did he say all that to you last night?  Did he make those delightful plans, and talk them over with you and Roger?\"  \"Don't look so furious.  It just came about, you see.  We were sitting there, waiting for you to come home, and Phil was saying how he adores you, and how he wanted your promise, but he had to wait a certain time before you would say positively.  And, of course, we were talking about my wedding, and I said it would be nice to announce your engagement then, it's always so picturesque to announce one wedding at another----\"  \"I'm sorry I can't oblige you, Mona, but if you want an engagement announced at your wedding I'm afraid you'll have to get some other girl.  You can keep the same man, if you like!\"  \"Oh, Patty, don't be cross with me!  It wasn't my fault!\"  \"That's so, Mona,--I'm a pig!  Forgive me, dear.  Now, to make up, I'll tell you just how it is.  I have told Philip that I'd give him my answer in about two weeks.  And that will be your wedding day.  But my answer is to be yes, only if he succeeds in teaching me to love him by that time.  And I don't mind telling you, that the way he talked to me last night doesn't exactly further his cause!\"  \"But, Patty, he was angry, you know, and jealous of those foolish Blaney people.\"  \"They're not foolish,--and I can't bear men who are jealous.  Now, Mona, girlie, you 'tend to your own suitor.  You've quite enough to do in the next two weeks, without dipping your pretty little fingers in my pie.\"  \"Yes,\" sighed Mona, \"I have.\"     CHAPTER V  AT RED CHIMNEYS  When Patty entered the dining-room, she found the rest already at breakfast.  \"'Scuse me for being late,\" she said, as she took her place, \"but I was up late last night.\"  She smiled gaily at Philip, whose somewhat frowning face relaxed into an answering smile.  \"Never mind that, Patty,\" said Mona, \"listen to what we're planning. Philip thinks it would be a good idea to buy Red Chimneys for the Kiddies' Home, and we're going to motor over to Spring Beach today to look at it.\"  \"Fine! but why go to look at it?  We all know exactly what it looks like----\"  \"Yes, Patty,\" said Philip, \"but there are several matters to see about. I know the house, generally speaking, but I want to look it over with the idea of a Home in mind.  Count up the rooms, get measurements and so forth, to present in my report to the Board of Managers.\"  \"All right, I'd like to go.  I think it would be fun.  Lunch at the hotel, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, or take something with us and picnic at the house.\"  \"Oh, that's lots nicer, don't you think so, Elise?\"  \"Well, you see, Patty, it doesn't matter to me which you do, as I'm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20945"],["title","Patty Blossom (#6)"],["body","going.  I'm sorry, but I've some engagements today that I must keep, so, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask to be left at home.\"  \"All right, then it's up to us.  What say, Mona?  Picnic sandwiches?\"  \"Yes, and some Thermos stuff,--soup and chocolate.  That will give us more time to look over the house.  There are some things I want to see about, if it's to leave my possession forever.\"  \"Why don't you keep it, Mona?  Why wouldn't you and Roger like it for a summer home?\"  \"We talked it over, and I'm rather tired of the place.  And Roger prefers going to different places each year.  Father told me I could have the house, and do what I liked with it, sell it or keep it.  But if they want it for this Home arrangement, I think I'll be rather glad to let it go.\"  The quartet started off in high spirits at the prospect of a jolly day. The big limousine was most comfortable and well equipped.  An ample luncheon was stowed away in hampers, and a skilful and careful chauffeur drove them at a speedy gait.  It was a glorious, clear, cold, sunshiny day, and the open windows gave them plenty of fresh air.  Patty, enveloped in furs, nestled in one corner of the wide back seat, and Mona was in the other.  The two men faced them.  Not a word had passed between Patty and Philip about the night before, and Patty wondered if he intended to let the matter go by without further reference.  \"You see it's this way,\" Philip began, addressing Patty; \"I haven't really had an opportunity of telling you about it yet.  We don't want to do anything much in the matter of the Home before Spring.  But as Mona's house is in the market, and as it seems like an ideal place to have for the children, I thought we'd better look into it, and, if advisable, buy it and then wait a few months before doing anything further.\"  \"I think so, too, Phil,\" Patty agreed.  \"I counted up the rooms and it will easily accommodate twenty or twenty-five kiddies, and that's as many as we can take care of, isn't it?\"  \"I think so; for the present, anyway.  And you know, Patty, all you have to do is to approve or disapprove of the purchase, and what you say, goes.\"  \"What an important personage you are, Patty,\" said Roger.  \"Your lightest word is law.\"  \"It won't be a light word,\" and Patty looked serious.  \"I shall consider the matter carefully, and with all the wisdom and forethought I can find in my brain.  This matter was left to me as a trust, and I'm not taking it lightly, I can tell you.  This purchase of a house is a permanent move, not a trifling, temporary question.  And unless the place is the very right place,--righter than any other place,--why, we don't want it, that's all.\"  \"Bravo, Patty!\" and Philip looked at her, admiringly.  \"You've got a lot of good sense and judgment under that fur headpiece of yours.\"  \"Fur headpiece!\" cried Patty; \"my new chinchilla toque!  This is my dearest possession, if you please.\"  \"It looks dear,\" observed Roger.  \"I believe that chinchilla animal is quite expensive.\"  \"It is indeed,\" declared Mona, \"my travelling suit is trimmed with it.\"  \"Travelling suit?\" asked Patty, innocently, \"are you going away?\"  \"She says so,\" Roger answered for her.  \"She says she's going to----\"  \"Hush!\" cried Mona, \"isn't that just like a man!  Why, you mustn't tell where you're going on your wedding trip!  It isn't done.\"  \"No, of course not,\" chimed in Patty; \"but, all the same, after you reach Palm Beach, let us know, won't you?\"  \"I will,\" declared Roger, \"but, do you know, it seems as if the time would never come!\"  \"Nice boy,\" said Mona,  approvingly; \"doesn't he make pretty speeches, Patty?\"  \"Lovely.  You'll have a beautiful time on your trip.  I 'most wish I was going with you?\"  \"Come on, Patty,\" said Philip, \"let's make it a double affair.  How about it?\"  \"No, thank you.  I haven't any suit trimmed with chinchilla.\"  \"You've a whole chinchilla coat on now,\" said Mona.  \"You could wear that.\"  \"What! get married in old clothes!  No-sir-ee!  The best part of a wedding is the trousseau.  That's the only thing that would ever persuade _me_ to take the fatal step.\"  \"It is fun,\" agreed Mona.  \"Oh, Patty, my green velvet came home yesterday!  It's simply wonderful!  The tunic, you know----\"  \"Help! help!\" cried Roger.  \"You girls have got us penned in here where we can't get away, but if you're going to talk about bias ruffling and side gores, I shall jump out the window!  I warn you.\"  \"You can't stop 'em, old man,\" said Van Reypen, gravely, \"they've got to go through with that green velvet, now they've begun on it. Proceed, Mona.  The tunic was trimmed with peplum, wasn't it? and the bodice was cut _en train_----\"  \"You don't deserve to know,\" Mona told him, \"and as for Roger, he'll see enough of that green velvet, poor man!  It's so beautiful, I expect to wear it on every possible occasion.\"  \"All right, dear,\" said Roger, rolling his eyes in mock devotion. \"Whatever you say, goes, my queen, my--y que--ee--n!\"  \"Even if I wear a rig like Alla Blaney wore last night?\" asked Mona, laughing.  \"Well, I must draw the line somewhere, and I should say that was the very place!  If you elect to appear in a scarecrow costume of that type, I shall send you back to your father.\"  \"No danger,\" and Mona shook her head.  \"Why do people want to make themselves such frights?\"  \"Their dress interprets their souls,\" said Van Reypen, sarcastically, \"and their souls are frights.\"  \"Nothing of the sort, Phil,\" flared out Patty; \"I'd like you to remember those people are my friends.\"  \"Well, my dear, if you choose to have friends with souls like frights, it is, of course, your privilege; but you must allow me to express my opinion of them.\"  \"And so you may,--but not to me.\"  \"Very well; consider I was talking to Mona,--which I really was.\"  \"Then continue to talk to her, for I don't want to talk to you.\"  \"All right, pretty Patty,--pretty little sunny-faced Patty,--all right.\"  Philip's voice was teasing and his smile was irritating, and Patty was angry at him anyway, yet she couldn't help laughing at his speech, for she looked as cross as a thunder cloud, and she knew it.  That is, as near to the crossness of a thunder cloud as Patty Fairfield could manage.  Her cheeks were reddened by the cold wind and her blue eyes always looked bluer in a frosty atmosphere.  And now, as an uncontrollable smile parted her scarlet lips, and her white teeth gleamed, and her dimples came into view, Patty justified Philip's term of \"pretty Patty,\" but she quickly concealed her smile by sinking her chin deep into the great fur collar of her coat.  \"Wasn't it a crazy party?\" Mona went on, not realising she was on a dangerous subject.  \"They all took themselves so seriously.\"  \"Why shouldn't they?\" said Patty, coming up out of her fur cave; \"it might be better if we all took ourselves more seriously,--such a lot of triflers and sillyheads as we are!\"  \"And such a lot of piffle-peddlers and hard-boiled eggs as they are!\" said Philip, fairly snorting in disgust.  \"Oh, very well!\" and Patty sank again into the chinchilla cavern.  Roger touched Mona's foot with his own, and gave her an urgent, significant glance, as he said, with a determination to change the subject, \"We'll just about get to Red Chimneys in time for luncheon. Shall we have our picnic before we explore the house?  I'm as hungry as three bears and a hunter.\"  \"So'm I,\" agreed Van Reypen, taking the cue.  \"What's in the hampers? Unless something pretty substantial, I vote we go to a hotel to feast.\"  \"No,\" said Mona, \"that wouldn't be half as much fun.  It's the picnicking that's so jolly.  If you agree, Patty,\" she added, for if Patty had any intention of sulking, there would be little fun in a picnic.  But Patty Fairfield was no spoilsport.  She was annoyed at Philip, but that was no reason for her to make the others uncomfortable, and she responded gaily, \"Oh, yes, the picnic is lots more fun.  But will the house be warm enough?\"  \"Yes,\" Mona answered, \"we telephoned down last night for Mr. Bates, the caretaker, to make some fires, and we can pile logs in the big hall fireplace till we roast alive.  We can have the feast in the hall, if the dining-room is chilly.\"  But they found the whole house fairly warm and distinctly cheery and homey-looking.  Bates had aired and dusted it, and had built fires and altogether the beautiful rooms looked so attractive, that Mona declared she was half inclined not to give it up, after all.  \"We could rent it some years, Roger,\" she said, \"and live in it some years, if we wanted to.\"  \"Just as you say, Mona,\" he replied; \"it's your house.  Wait until spring to decide, if you prefer.\"  \"All right,\" said Van Reypen, \"but I fear we must decide on the house we buy before that.  For we want to get the place we're to have in order as soon as Spring pokes her nose in.\"  \"We'll have luncheon first,\" Mona decided, \"and then discuss the matter.\"  The men opened the hampers, and the girls set the table in the great hall, near the roaring wood fire that filled the enormous fireplace. Salads and sandwiches, carefully packed, were in faultless condition, and the numerous Thermos bottles held hot soup, coffee, and chocolate. A small freezer of ice cream appeared from somewhere, and a box of confectionery contented the girls while the men smoked after the repast.  \"It's this way,\" said Roger, at last, when they had talked over the whole thing thoroughly, \"Mona and I are considering our future,--yes, even our old age!  And, so, there are some points that we want to discuss alone.  Therefore, and wherefore, my friends,--my future wife and I will, if you please, go apart by ourselves for a bit of confidential chat.\"  \"Good gracious, Roger,\" said Patty, \"anybody would think you two were married already!\"  \"Same as,\" Roger retorted; \"especially in matters of real estate, and future dwelling-houses and such things.  But, really, what I'm going to do, is, to try to persuade, cajole, or coerce"]]]
