But Swartboy had much to say about the locusts, as well as the inspired Joel.  Thus spoke Swartboy:--  \"Bushman no fear da springhaan.  Bushman hab no garden--no maize--no buckwheat--no nothing for da springhaan to eat.  Bushman eat locust himself--he grow fat on da locust.  Ebery thing eat dem dar springhaan. Ebery thing grow fat in da locust season.  Ho! den for dem springhaan!\"  These remarks of Swartboy were true enough.  The locusts are eaten by almost every species of animal known in South Africa.  Not only do the _carnivora_ greedily devour them, but also animals and birds of the game kind--such as antelopes, partridges, guinea-fowls, bustards, and, strange to say, the giant of all--the huge elephant--will travel for miles to overtake a migration of locusts!  Domestic fowls, sheep, horses, and dogs, devour them with equal greediness.  Still another strange fact--the locusts eat one another!  If any one of them gets hurt, so as to impede his progress, the others immediately turn upon him and eat him up!  The Bushmen and other native races of Africa submit the locusts to a process of cookery before eating them; and during the whole evening Swartboy had been engaged in preparing the bagful which he had collected.  He \"cooked\" them thus:--  He first boiled, or rather _steamed_ them, for only a small quantity of water was put into the pot.  This process lasted two hours.  They were then taken out, and allowed to dry; and after that shaken about in a pan, until all the legs and wings were broken off from the bodies.  A winnowing process--Swartboy's thick lips acting as a fan--was next gone through; and the legs and wings were thus got rid of.  The locusts were then ready for eating.  A little salt only was required to render them more palatable, when all present made trial of, and some of the children even liked them.  By many, locusts prepared in this way are considered quite equal to shrimps!  Sometimes they are pounded when quite dry into a sort of meal, and with water added to them, are made into a kind of stir-about.  When well dried, they will keep for a long time; and they frequently form the only store of food, which the poorer natives have to depend upon for a whole season.  Among many tribes--particularly among those who are not agricultural-- the coming of the locusts is a source of rejoicing.  These people turn out with sacks, and often with pack-oxen to collect and bring them to their villages; and on such occasions vast heaps of them are accumulated and stored, in the same way as grain!  Conversing of these things the night passed on until it was time for going to bed.  The field-cornet went out once again to observe the wind; and then the door of the little kraal was closed and the family retired to rest.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE LOCUST-FLIGHT.  The field-cornet slept but little.  Anxiety kept him awake.  He turned and tossed, and thought of the locusts.  He napped at intervals, and dreamt about locusts, and crickets, and grasshoppers, and all manner of great long-legged, goggle-eyed insects.  He was glad when the first ray of light penetrated through the little window of his chamber.  He sprang to his feet; and, scarce staying to dress himself, rushed out into the open air.  It was still dark, but he did not require to see the wind.  He did not need to toss a feather or hold up his hat.  The truth was too plain.  A strong breeze was blowing--it was blowing _from the west_!  Half distracted, he ran farther out to assure himself.  He ran until clear of the walls that enclosed the kraals and garden.  He halted and felt the air.  Alas! his first impression was correct. The breeze blew directly from the west--directly from the locusts.  He could perceive the effluvium borne from the hateful insects: there was no longer cause to doubt.  Groaning in spirit, Von Bloom returned to his house.  He had no longer any hope of escaping the terrible visitation.  His first directions were to collect all the loose pieces of linen or clothing in the house, and pack them within the family chests.  What! would the locusts be likely to eat them?  Indeed, yes--for these voracious creatures are not fastidious.  No particular vegetable seems to be chosen by them.  The leaves of the bitter tobacco plant appear to be as much to their liking as the sweet and succulent blades of maize!  Pieces of linen, cotton, and even flannel, are devoured by them, as though they were the tender shoots of plants.  Stones, iron, and hard wood, are about the only objects that escape their fierce masticators.  Von Bloom had heard this.  Hans had read of it, and Swartboy confirmed it from his own experience.  Consequently, everything that was at all destructible was carefully stowed away; and then breakfast was cooked and eaten in silence.  There was a gloom over the faces of all, because he who was the head of all was silent and dejected.  What a change within a few hours!  But the evening before the field-cornet and his little family were in the full enjoyment of happiness.  There was still one hope, though a slight one.  Might it yet rain?  Or might the day turn out cold?  In either case Swartboy said the locusts could not take wing--for they cannot fly in cold or rainy weather.  In the event of a cold or wet day they would have to remain as they were, and perhaps the wind might change round again before they resumed their flight.  Oh, for a torrent of rain, or a cold cloudy day!  Vain wish! vain hope!  In half-an-hour after the sun rose up in African splendour, and his hot rays, slanting down upon the sleeping host, warmed them into life and activity.  They commenced to crawl, to hop about, and then, as if by one impulse, myriads rose into the air.  The breeze impelled them in the direction in which it was blowing,--in the direction of the devoted maize-fields.  In less than five minutes, from the time they had taken wing, they were over the kraal, and dropping in tens of thousands upon the surrounding fields.  Slow was their flight, and gentle their descent, and to the eyes of those beneath they presented the appearance of a shower of _black_ snow, falling in large feathery flakes.  In a few moments the ground was completely covered, until every stalk of maize, every plant and bush, carried its hundreds.  On the outer plains too, as far as eye could see, the pasture was strewed thickly; and as the great flight had now passed to the eastward of the house, the sun's disk was again hidden by them as if by an eclipse!  They seemed to move in a kind of _echellon_, the bands in the rear constantly flying to the front, and then halting to feed, until in turn these were headed by others that had advanced over them in a similar manner.  The noise produced by their wings was not the least curious phenomenon; and resembled a steady breeze playing among the leaves of the forest, or the sound of a water-wheel.  For two hours this passage continued.  During most of that time, Von Bloom and his people had remained within the house, with closed doors and windows.  This they did to avoid the unpleasant shower, as the creatures impelled by the breeze, often strike the cheek so forcibly as to cause a feeling of pain.  Moreover, they did not like treading upon the unwelcome intruders, and crushing them under their feet, which they must have done, had they moved about outside where the ground was thickly covered.  Many of the insects even crawled inside, through the chinks of the door and windows, and greedily devoured any vegetable substance which happened to be lying about the floor.  At the end of two hours Von Bloom looked forth.  The thickest of the flight had passed.  The sun was again shining; but upon what was he shining?  No longer upon green fields and a flowery garden.  No.  Around the house, on every side, north, south, east, and west, the eye rested only on black desolation.  Not a blade of grass, not a leaf could be seen--even the very bark was stripped from the trees, that now stood as if withered by the hand of God!  Had fire swept the surface, it could not have left it more naked and desolate.  There was no garden, there were no fields of maize or buckwheat, there was no longer a farm--the kraal stood in the midst of a desert!  Words cannot depict the emotions of the field-cornet at that moment. The pen cannot describe his painful feelings.  Such a change in two hours!  He could scarce credit his senses--he could scarce believe in its reality.  He knew that the locusts would eat up his maize, and his wheat, and the vegetables of his garden; but his fancy had fallen far short of the extreme desolation that had actually been produced.  The whole landscape was metamorphosed--grass was out of the question--trees, whose delicate foliage had played in the soft breeze but two short hours before, now stood leafless, scathed by worse than winter.  The very ground seemed altered in shape!  He would not have known it as his own farm.  Most certainly had the owner been absent during the period of the locust-flight, and approached without any information of what had been passing, he would not have recognised the place of his own habitation!  With the phlegm peculiar to his race, the field-cornet sat down, and remained for a long time without speech or movement.  His children gathered near, and looked on--their young hearts painfully throbbing.  They could not fully appreciate the difficult circumstances in which this occurrence had placed them; nor did their father himself at first.  He thought only of the loss he had sustained, in the destruction of his fine crops; and this of itself, when we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21237"],["title","The Bush Boys: History and Adventures of a Cape Farmer and his Family (#5)"],["body","his isolated situation, and the hopelessness of restoring them, was enough to cause him very great chagrin.  \"Gone! all gone!\" he exclaimed, in a sorrowing voice.  \"Oh!  Fortune-- Fortune--again art thou cruel!\"  \"Papa! do not grieve,\" said a soft voice; \"we are all alive yet, we are here by your side;\" and with the words a little white hand was laid upon his shoulder.  It was the hand of the beautiful Truey.  It seemed as if an angel had smiled upon him.  He lifted the child in his arms, and in a paroxysm of fondness pressed her to his heart.  That heart felt relieved.  \"Bring me the Book,\" said he, addressing one of the boys.  The Bible was brought--its massive covers were opened--a verse was chosen--and the song of praise rose up in the midst of the desert.  The Book was closed; and for some minutes all knelt in prayer.  When Von Bloom again stood upon his feet, and looked around him, the desert seemed once more to \"rejoice and blossom as the rose.\"  Upon the human heart such is the magic influence of resignation and humility.    CHAPTER SIX.  \"INSPANN AND TREK!\"  With all his confidence in the protection of a Supreme Being, Von Bloom knew that he was not to leave everything to the Divine hand.  That was not the religion he had been taught; and he at once set about taking measures to extricate himself from the unpleasant position in which he was placed.  _Unpleasant_ position!  Ha!  It was more than unpleasant, as the field-cornet began to perceive.  It was a position of _peril_!  The more Von Bloom reflected, the more was he convinced of this.  There they were, in the middle of a black naked plain, that without a green spot extended beyond the limits of vision.  How much farther he could not guess; but he knew that the devastations of the migratory locust sometimes cover an area of thousands of miles!  It was certain that the one that had just swept past was on a very extensive scale.  It was evident he could no longer remain by his kraal.  His horses, and cattle, and sheep, could not live without food; and should these perish, upon what were he and his family to subsist?  He must leave the kraal. He must go in search of pasture, without loss of time,--at once. Already the animals, shut up beyond their usual hour, were uttering their varied cries, impatient to be let out.  They would soon hunger; and it was hard to say when food could be procured for them.  There was no time to be lost.  Every hour was of great importance,--even minutes must not be wasted in dubious hesitation.  The field-cornet spent but a few minutes in consideration.  Whether should he mount one of his best horses, and ride off alone in search of pasture? or whether would it not be better to \"inspann\" his wagon, and take everything along with him at once?  He soon decided in favour of the latter course.  In any case he would have been compelled to move from his present location,--to leave the kraal altogether.  He might as well take everything at once.  Should he go out alone, it might cost him a long time to find grass and water--for both would be necessary--and, meantime, his stock would be suffering.  These and other considerations decided him at once to \"inspann\" and \"trek\" away, with his wagon, his horses, his cattle, his sheep, his \"household gods,\" and his whole family circle.  \"Inspann and trek!\" was the command: and Swartboy, who was proud of the reputation he had earned as a wagon-driver, was now seen waving his bamboo whip like a great fishing-rod.  \"Inspann and trek!\" echoed Swartboy, tying upon his twenty-feet lash a new cracker, which he had twisted out of the skin of the hartebeest antelope.  \"Inspann and trek!\" he repeated, making his vast whip crack like a pistol; \"yes, baas, I'll inspann;\" and, having satisfied himself that his \"voorslag\" was properly adjusted, Swartboy rested the bamboo handle against the side of the house, and proceeded to the kraal to collect the yoke-oxen.  A large wagon, of a sort that is the pride and property of every Cape farmer, stood to one side of the house.  It was a vehicle of the first class,--a regular \"cap-tent\" wagon,--that had been made for the field-cornet in his better days, and in which he had been used to drive his wife and children to the \"nacht-maal\" and upon _vrolykheids_ (parties of pleasure.)  In those days a team of eight fine horses used to draw it along at a rattling rate.  Alas! oxen had now to take their place; for Von Bloom had but five horses in his whole stud, and these were required for the saddle.  But the wagon was almost as good as ever it had been,--almost as good as when it used to be the envy of the field-cornet's neighbours, the boors of Graaf Reinet.  Nothing was broken.  Everything was in its place,--\"voor-kist,\" and \"achter-kist,\" and side-chests.  There was the snow-white cap, with its \"fore-clap\" and \"after-clap,\" and its inside pockets, all complete; and the wheels neatly carved, and the well planed boxing and \"disselboom\" and the strong \"trektow\" of buffalo-hide. Nothing was wanting that ought to be found about a wagon.  It was, in fact, the best part of the field-cornet's property that remained to him,--for it was equal in value to all the oxen, cattle, and sheep, upon his establishment.  While Swartboy, assisted by Hendrik, was catching up the twelve yoke-oxen, and attaching them to the disselboom and trektow of the wagon, the \"baas\" himself, aided by Hans, Totty, and also by Truey and little Jan, was loading up the furniture and implements.  This was not a difficult task.  The _Penates_ of the little kraal were not numerous, and were all soon packed either inside or around the roomy vehicle.  In about an hour's time the wagon was loaded up, the oxen were inspanned, the horses saddled, and everything was ready for \"trekking.\"  And now arose the question, _whither_?  Up to this time Von Bloom had only thought of getting away from the spot--of escaping beyond the naked waste that surrounded him.  It now became necessary to determine the direction in which they were to travel--a most important consideration.  Important, indeed, as a little reflection showed.  They might go in the direction in which the locusts had gone, or that in which they had _come_?  On either route they might travel for scores of miles without meeting with a mouthful of grass for the hungry animals; and in such a case these would break down and perish.  Or the travellers might move in some other direction, and find grass, but not water.  Without water, not only would they have to fear for the cattle, but for themselves--for their own lives.  How important then it was, which way they turned their faces!  At first the field-cornet bethought him of heading towards the settlements.  The nearest water in that direction was almost fifty miles off.  It lay to the eastward of the kraal.  The locusts had just gone that way.  They would by this time have laid waste the whole country-- perhaps to the water or beyond it!  It would be a great risk going in that direction.  Northward lay the Kalihari desert.  It would be hopeless to steer north. Von Bloom knew of no oasis in the desert.  Besides the locusts had come from the north.  They were drifting southward when first seen; and from the time they had been observed passing in this last direction, they had no doubt ere this wasted the plains far to the south.  The thoughts of the field-cornet were now turned to the west.  It is true the swarm had last approached from the west; but Von Bloom fancied that they had first come down from the north, and that the sudden veering round of the wind had caused them to change direction.  He thought that by trekking westward he would soon get beyond the ground they had laid bare.  He knew something of the plains to the west--not much indeed, but he knew that at about forty miles distance there was a spring with good pasturage around it, upon whose water he could depend.  He had once visited it, while on a search for some of his cattle, that had wandered thus far.  Indeed, it then appeared to him a better situation for cattle than the one he held, and he had often thought of moving to it.  Its great distance from any civilised settlement was the reason why he had not done so.  Although he was already far beyond the frontier, he still kept up a sort of communication with the settlements, whereas at the more distant point such a communication would be extremely difficult.  Now that other considerations weighed with him, his thoughts once more returned to this spring; and after spending a few minutes more in earnest deliberation, he decided upon \"trekking\" westward.  Swartboy was ordered to head round, and strike to the west.  The Bushman promptly leaped to his seat upon the voor-kist, cracked his mighty whip, straightened out his long team, and moved off over the plain.  Hans and Hendrik were already in their saddles; and having cleared the kraals of all their live-stock, with the assistance of the dogs, drove the lowing and bleating animals before them.  Truey and little Jan sat beside Swartboy on the fore-chest of the wagon; and the round full eyes of the pretty springbok could be seen peeping curiously out from under the cap-tent.  Casting a last look upon his desolate kraal, the field-cornet turned his horse's head, and rode after the wagon.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  \"WATER!  WATER!\"  On moved the little caravan, but not in silence.  Swartboy's voice and whip made an almost continual noise.  The latter could be plainly heard more than a mile over the plain, like repeated discharges of a musket. Hendrik, too, did a good deal in the way of shouting; and even the usually quiet Hans was under the necessity of using his voice to urge the flock forward in the right direction.  Occasionally both the boys were called upon to give Swartboy a help with the leading oxen when these became obstinate or restive, and would turn out of the track.  At such times either Hans or Hendrik would gallop up, set the heads of"]]]
