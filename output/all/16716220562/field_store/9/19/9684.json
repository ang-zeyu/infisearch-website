VII  TWO IN A TREE   WHEN Miss Kitty Cat dashed out of the woodshed Frisky Squirrel was two jumps ahead of her. That was really a better lead than it sounds. Frisky was always a good jumper. And the more scared he was, the further he could leap. Anybody that knew him well would have known then--just to see him--that something had given him a great fright.  First he had noticed a strange smell. Next he had seen a strange nose come stealing out of the woodshed door. And not knowing who was going to follow that nose, Frisky Squirrel felt that the sooner he climbed a tree the better it would be for him. So he made for a tall elm that wasn't too far away.  Though Miss Kitty Cat was a fast runner, Frisky reached the foot of the tree ahead of her. And he was half way to the lowest branches before he took a real look at his pursuer.  To his dismay he saw that the creature hadn't stopped at the foot of the tree. The monster had already begun climbing after him. Frisky had never seen any one just like this fierce person. One look was enough for him. He pushed higher and higher into the tree-top and crept far out on a drooping limb, which swayed beneath his weight as he clung to it.  There he paused, while he watched to see what the stranger would do. And as he stared at the creature he remembered suddenly what Mr. Crow had told him. \"There's a cat at the farmhouse,\" the old gentleman had said.  \"This must be the cat,\" Frisky thought. And to her he called, \"If you're the cat, don't come any nearer, madam! You might get hurt.\" For he remembered, too, that he had told Mr. Crow that he wouldn't harm the cat.  \"It _is_ the cat,\" he said to himself presently, \"for she has stopped.\"  Miss Kitty Cat did not quite dare follow Frisky Squirrel to the tip where he swung. She crouched upon the branch a little way from him, where it was safer for her, and with switching tail and bristling whiskers waited to see what he would do next.  \"It makes me uneasy to see you swaying so,\" she told Frisky. \"Besides, you're shaking this limb. And I don't like it.\"  \"She's a fussy creature--this cat!\" Frisky said to himself. \"I promised Mr. Crow I wouldn't hurt her; but I didn't promise him that I wouldn't tease her.\" So he bobbed up and down with all his might.  \"Stop!\" cried Miss Kitty Cat. \"That's a very reckless thing to do. It's like rocking the boat.\"  \"I think it's the finest sport in the world,\" Frisky chuckled.  \"I know a finer,\" Miss Kitty snarled.  \"What that?\" he asked her.  \"If I could get my claws on you I'd soon show you,\" she told him grimly.  Somehow there was something about her remark that startled Frisky Squirrel--something that made him shiver. And when he shivered he lost his hold. Down he dropped, slipping and floundering from one branch to another.  And down Miss Kitty Cat followed him.     VIII  NINE LIVES   FRISKY SQUIRREL was much more at home in the trees than Miss Kitty Cat was. While Frisky managed at last to cling to a limb and right himself, Miss Kitty lost her footing and fell out of the tree completely.  \"Oh! She'll he hurt!\" Frisky cried as he saw her turning and twisting through the air. But to his great surprise she struck with all her four feet on the ground, quite unharmed. \"You did that very nicely,\" he called to her generously.  But she didn't answer. To tell the truth, she felt rather foolish because she had fallen out of the tree. And she walked back to the woodshed and stalked through the doorway without saying a word.  After that adventure Frisky Squirrel decided to go back home. So he scurried town the tree-trunk and scampered to the stone wall, and scooted along the top of it.  Old Mr. Crow was watching for him. And as before, he dropped down near the wall to talk.  \"I hardly expected to see you again,\" Mr. Crow remarked. \"You couldn't have met the cat.\"  \"Yes!\" said Frisky. \"I met her. She followed me up a tree. And it's a wonder she didn't get hurt, though I was careful of her. She had a fall; but she landed beautifully.\"  Old Mr. Crow nodded wisely.  \"She always lands on her feet,\" he observed. \"And you needn't worry about her,\" he added. \"You know, they say she has nine lives.\"  \"Nine lives!\" Frisky Squirrel exclaimed. \"What do you mean, Mr. Crow?\"  Now, Mr. Crow really knew a great deal, because he had lived many years. And he pretended to know still more, because he liked to appear learned. But this question was a puzzler for him. He simply couldn't answer it.  \"You wouldn't understand, even if I explained,\" he told Frisky Squirrel. And then he flew away, leaving Frisky to run home and wonder what it meant to have nine lives.  As for Mr. Crow, he suddenly made up his mind that he would find out about Miss Kitty Cat's nine lives. He would ask that lady herself. So he flapped himself over to the big elm in the farmyard, where he cawed and cawed, hoping that Miss Kitty Cat would appear to see what all the noise was about.  And sure enough! she soon bounced out of the woodshed door and looked up at Mr. Crow inquiringly.  \"I've been hearing a good deal about; you,\" Mr. Crow called down to her in what he considered his sweetest tones, though anybody else would have said they were quite hoarse. \"I know you always manage to land on your feet--and I can understand that. But what's this I hear about _nine lives?_\"  Miss Kitty Cat only stared at him.  \"Perhaps you don't feel like talking,\" said Mr. Crow. \"If you've just had a fall, maybe you're still a bit shaken up, even if you did land on your feet. Perhaps you'd rather I came back later.\"  Miss Kitty Cat suddenly found her voice.  \"You've been gossiping with that young squirrel!\" she snapped. \"I'll have you know that I'm not shaken up at all. But I'd shake you up if I could get hold of you!\"  Mr. Crow was astonished. He was sure he had been most polite. Yet here was Miss Kitty Cat as rude as she could be!  He amused himself by jeering at her until she turned her back on him and went inside the woodshed. And he had to go away without learning anything at all about the nine lives of Miss Kitty Cat. They always remained a deep mystery. Everybody agreed that the number was nine. But beyond that, nobody could explain about them.     IX  THE STOLEN CREAM   \"I DECLARE!\" Farmer Green's wife cried one day. \"Somebody's been stealing my cream in the buttery.\"  The buttery was a big bare room on the shady side of the house, where great pans of milk stood on a long table. When the cream was thick enough on the milk Mrs. Green skimmed it off and put it in cans. At one end of the buttery there was a trap door in the floor. When the trap was raised you could look right down into a well. And into its cool depths Mrs. Green dropped her cans of cream by means of a rope, which she fastened to a beam under the floor, so the tops of the cans would stay out of the water.  Mrs. Green made butter out of that cream. So it was no wonder she was upset when she discovered that some one had meddled with one of her pans of milk.  \"It can't be the cat,\" said Farmer Green's wife. \"The buttery door has been shut tight all the time.\"  Miss Kitty Cat was right there in the kitchen while Mrs. Green was talking to her husband. And it was easy to see that Miss Kitty agreed with her mistress. She came close to Mrs. Green and purred, saying quite plainly that she was a good, honest cat and that she deserved to be petted. At least, that was what Mrs. Green understood her to mean.  Often, after that, Mrs. Green discovered traces of the thief in the buttery. Flecks of cream on the side of a milk pan, drops of cream on the table, smudges of cream now and then on the floor! Such signs meant something. But Farmer Green's wife couldn't decide what.  And another strange thing happened. Miss Kitty Cat lost her appetite for milk. She would leave her saucer of milk untasted on the kitchen floor.  Now and then Mrs. Green picked Miss Kitty up and looked closely at her face. At such times Miss Kitty purred pleasantly. She did not seem to be the least bit disturbed.  One evening, after dark, Johnnie Green went into the buttery to get a pail. The moment he opened the door there was a crash and a clatter inside the room.  Johnnie jumped back quickly.  \"There's somebody in the buttery!\" he shouted.  But when his father brought a light they found no one there. A tin dipper lay on the floor.  \"When you opened the door it must have jarred the dipper off the edge of the table,\" said Farmer Green.  \"_Meaow!_\" said a voice behind them. There stood Miss Kitty Cat, saying that everything _must_ have happened exactly as Farmer Green said.  \"She couldn't have been in here, could she?\" Farmer Green puzzled. \"Come, Kitty!\" And he picked up Miss Kitty and held her where the light fell full upon her face. \"Clean as a whistle!\" said Farmer Green. \"I guess she just followed us in.\" He set her down again. And once more, with a plaintive _meaow_ she agreed with him perfectly.     X  A CREAMY FACE   FARMER GREEN'S wife threw away pan after pan of milk, because she knew somebody had been stealing cream off the top of them. At least, she told Farmer Green to feed the milk to the pigs, because she wasn't going to make butter of any cream that had been tampered with by goodness knew whom or what. And old dog Spot said that feeding good creamy milk to the pigs was just the same as throwing it away. He made that remark to Miss Kitty Cat, adding that it was a shame that somebody was stealing cream and declaring that he hoped to catch the thief.  Miss Kitty Cat made no reply whatsoever.  \"Don't you hope I'll catch the guilty party?\" Spot asked her.  \"Please don't speak to me!\" Miss Kitty Cat exclaimed impatiently. \"I don't enjoy your talk; and you may as well know it.\"  \"Very well!\" said Spot. \"But when I catch him I'll let you know.\"  \"She's jealous,\" Spot thought. \"She knows I'm a good watch dog. And she can't bear the idea of my catching a thief.\"  It was hard, usually, to tell how Miss Kitty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],["title","The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#3)"],["body"," felt about anything. She was a great one for keeping her opinions to herself. It seemed as if she wanted to be let alone by every one except Farmer Green's family.  Having boasted about catching the cream thief, old dog Spot began to watch the buttery very carefully. Search as he would, he couldn't find a chink anywhere that was big enough even for a mouse to squeeze through.  One day he happened to catch a glimpse of something moving under the roof of the shed next the buttery. To his amazement he saw Miss Kitty Cat slip through an old stove-pipe hole that pierced the great chimney which led down into the buttery, where there was an ancient fireplace which hadn't been used for years and years. Miss Kitty Cat crept along a tiebeam and hid herself in a pile of odds and ends that somebody had stowed high up under the roof and left there to gather dust and cob-webs.  \"Ah, ha!\" said Spot under his breath. \"This is interesting.\"  When Miss Kitty Cat visited the kitchen a little later there wasn't a speck of dirt on her coat. And her face was spotless. No one would have guessed that she had ever made her way through an old chimney.  Old dog Spot said nothing to her then. But he chuckled to himself. He had a plan that pleased him hugely.  All this happened on a morning. And late that afternoon when Miss Kitty Cat wasn't anywhere to be seen, and Farmer Green's wife opened the buttery door to get a pitcher of cream for supper, Spot suddenly began to bark in the shed. He scrambled up a stepladder that leaned against the wall and stood on the top of it while he pawed the air frantically, as if he were trying to fly.  The noise brought Mrs. Green hurriedly out of the buttery. And she was just in time to see Miss Kitty Cat peer out of the old stove-pipe hole, with a _creamy_ look about her mouth.  Well, the cat was out of the bag at last. Or perhaps it would be more exact to say that Miss Kitty was out of the buttery. Anyhow, it was very plain to Mrs. Green that she had been in the buttery only a moment before, lapping thick cream off a pan of milk. And she hadn't had time to wash her face.  After that Farmer Green stopped up the stove-pipe hole. And soon Miss Kitty's appetite for milk returned. When Mrs. Green set out her saucer of milk for her Miss Kitty lapped it up greedily--and even licked the saucer clean.  Old dog Spot watched her with a grin.  \"I let you know when I caught the cream thief, just as I promised you I would,\" he jeered.  Miss Kitty wiped her face very carefully before replying.  \"Don't boast!\" she said. \"It's a disagreeable thing to do.... Besides, _I_ knew--_long before you did_--who was taking Mrs. Green's cream.\"     XI  THE WRENS' HOME   THERE wasn't a bird on the farm that didn't dislike Miss Kitty Cat. And there was only one bird family that didn't live in dread of her. That was the Wren family. And they had a good reason for feeling safe from Miss Kitty.  Miss Kitty Cat always spluttered whenever she unbent herself enough to talk with anybody about Rusty Wren and his busy little wife, who had their home in the cherry tree outside Farmer Green's window.  \"The Wrens needn't feel so proud of their house,\" Miss Kitty Cat sometimes said. \"It's nothing but an old syrup can. And I know for a fact that Mrs. Bluebird looked at it last spring when she was hunting for a home. And she said she wouldn't live in such a place. I heard her tell her husband so.\"  Now, the reason why Mr. and Mrs. Wren liked their house and the reason why Miss Kitty Cat didn't were one and the same: Miss Kitty couldn't get inside it. The mouth of the syrup can, which the Wren family used for a door, was no bigger than a quarter of a dollar. It was entirely too small for Miss Kitty Cat, though it was big enough to admit Rusty Wren and his plump wife.  Miss Kitty said everything she could to persuade the Wren family to build themselves a nest in a crotch of the tree, like other birds.  \"I'm sure,\" she told them, \"you'd like such a home much better than this. There's no reason why you shouldn't be as fashionable as everybody else. You wouldn't have to look for a place to build. There's room enough right in this old cherry tree for a hundred happy homes if anybody wanted to build them.\"  \"We like our house,\" Rusty Wren said.  \"I wouldn't move, even if he wanted to,\" Mrs. Wren declared.  \"Maybe you'd move because he _doesn't_ want to,\" Miss Kitty Cat suggested.  But Mrs. Wren shook her head in a most decided way.  \"No!\" she said. \"I'm satisfied with my house. And our neighbors would be far better off if they built as we do, inside a snug sort of box.\"  \"You'll never know what you're missing,\" Miss Kitty remarked, \"if you don't try an open nest sometime. Now, only yesterday I visited Jolly Robin's family over in the orchard. And their youngsters certainly did look beautiful. But you keep yours hidden inside that old syrup can where nobody can see them. It's a shame that the public can't have a chance to admire such fine nestlings as you must have in there.\"  Miss Kitty Cat was sitting under the cherry tree. And she looked up and smiled most agreeably at Mrs. Wren.  Rusty Wren looked thoughtful.  \"There's something in what she says,\" he whispered to his wife. \"It is too bad not to let the neighbors admire the finest nestlings in Pleasant Valley.\"  \"You know they say a cat may look at a king,\" Miss Kitty simpered. \"Well, a fortnight ago I went over to the pine woods and had a look at a Ruby Crowned Kinglet's family. So it seems only fair that I shouldn't be denied a look at your little wrenlets.\"     XII  JOLLY ROBIN'S NEWS   IN A WAY Miss Kitty Cat was a patient creature. She could play a waiting game. She spent hours watching rat-holes without growing restless.  So after her talk with Rusty Wren and his wife, when she urged them to give up their boxlike house and build themselves an open nest like most other birds, Miss Kitty left them.  \"I'll let my words sink in,\" Miss Kitty muttered to herself. \"Of course they'll want to talk things over privately.\"  It wasn't often that she made herself so agreeable to any of the bird people. Indeed, she had been so pleasant that Rusty Wren began to think that Miss Kitty was a much kinder creature than he had always supposed.  \"Miss Kitty's very agreeable,\" Rusty Wren remarked to his wife. \"Did you notice how sweetly she spoke of our children?\"  \"Huh!\" said Mrs. Wren. \"She may fool you; but she can't fool me. She's a mealy-mouthed animal, if ever I met one.\"  \"I don't see how you can say that about Miss Kitty Cat,\" Rusty replied. \"She doesn't eat meal.\"  \"I suppose you'll be saying next that she doesn't eat birds!\" his wife exclaimed.  \"I fear you've been listening to gossip,\" Rusty ventured. \"If Miss Kitty Cat comes back I hope you'll be cordial to her.\"  He could have bitten his tongue a moment later for saying that, because Mrs. Wren began to scold him. And he flew away and left her as soon as he could think of a good excuse.  He went over to the orchard, where he flitted about for some time. And at last he met Jolly Robin, who appeared most doleful.  \"What's the matter?\" Rusty Wren asked. \"You look terribly upset.\"  \"So I am,\" Jolly Robin admitted. \"We had a caller yesterday.\"  \"Well, well!\" said Rusty Wren. \"That's nothing to be glum about.\"  \"You'd think so if you were I. It was Miss Kitty Cat. And when she left she took one of our nestlings with her.\"  \"Perhaps she only borrowed it,\" Rusty Wren suggested. \"Maybe she'll return it to-day.\"  \"No!\" Jolly Robin told him. \"If she comes back again it will only be to take another one.\"  Suddenly Rusty Wren remembered that he had urged his wife to be cordial to Miss Kitty Cat the next time she called at the cherry tree where they lived.  \"I must hurry home!\" he cried. \"I must warn my wife.\"  \"But your youngsters are safe,\" Jolly Robin assured him. \"Miss Kitty Cat can't reach them inside the tin can where you built your nest.\"  \"That's true,\" Rusty Wren admitted. \"But there's my wife! Miss Kitty might harm her, if she caught her unawares.\" So he started for home at top speed.     XIII  AN UNWELCOME GUEST   AS he neared his home in the cherry tree, Rusty Wren saw a fearsome sight. Miss Kitty Cat was crouched right on top of the tin syrup can which Johnnie Green had nailed to the tree. Inside that can was the Wren family's nest. And inside the nest were some brand-new youngsters, only two days out of their shells.  It was no wonder that when Rusty Wren came hack from the orchard and saw such a sight he began to shriek.  \"What are you doing on my roof?\" he shrilled.  Miss Kitty Cat looked up calmly and watched him as he hopped about in the top of the tree above her head.  [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Looked Calmly at Rusty Wren.]  \"I've come to make another call on your wife,\" she explained.  Then a muffled voice chirped, \"She's been here a long time and I can't get her to go away.\"  The moment he heard that, Rusty Wren felt better. It was his wife's voice and it meant that she was safe. To be sure, Rusty knew that she was a prisoner in her own house; for it was plain that she dared not leave it so long as Miss Kitty Cat stayed on the roof, ready to grab Mrs. Wren the moment she stepped out of her doorway.  \"Your wife is very shy,\" Miss Kitty remarked to Rusty Wren with a sly smile. \"I've been hoping to get more acquainted with her. That's why I climbed up and sat on your roof. When people are shy and don't invite me inside their houses I believe in making myself at home outside, while I wait for them to appear.\"  From her doorway Mrs. Wren called to her husband, \"Don't let her deceive you with her pretty talk! Remember what I told you! She's mealy-mouthed.... If you had seen her trying to reach her paw through the door you'd know how dangerous she is.\"  \"There!\" said Miss Kitty Cat with a sigh. \"People never seem to understand my ways. I was only trying to shake hands!\"  \"With her claws!\" cried the muffled voice of Rusty Wren's wife. \"Ugh! She's a"]]]
