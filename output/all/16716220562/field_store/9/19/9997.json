It would have been I, who would have been shot dead by Miss Briggerland's father from the drawing-room window.\"  The girl looked at him in amazement.  \"What a preposterous charge to make!\" she said at last indignantly. \"Do you suggest that this girl has connived at a murder?\"  \"I not only suggest that she connived at it, but I stake my life that she planned it,\" said Jack carefully.  \"But the pistol was found near Mr. Bulford's body,\" said Lydia almost triumphantly, as she conceived this unanswerable argument.  Jack nodded.  \"From Bulford's body to the drawing-room window was exactly nine feet. It was possible to pitch the pistol so that it fell near him. Bulford was waiting there by the instructions of Jean Briggerland. We have traced the telephone call that came through to him from the club--it came from the Briggerlands' house in Berkeley Street, and the attendant at the club was sure it was a woman's voice. We didn't find that out till after the trial. Poor Meredith was in the hall when the shot was fired. The signal was given when he turned the handle to let himself out. He heard the shot, rushed down the steps and saw the body. Whether he picked up the pistol or not, I do not know. Jean Briggerland swears he had it in his hand, but, of course, Jean Briggerland is a hopeless liar!\"  \"You can't know what you're saying,\" said Lydia in a low voice. \"It is a dreadful charge to make, dreadful, against a girl whose very face refutes such an accusation.\"  \"Her face is her fortune,\" snapped Jack, and then penitently, \"I'm sorry I'm rude, but somehow the very mention of Jean Briggerland arouses all that is worst in me. Now, you will accept Jaggs, won't you?\"  \"Who is he?\" she asked.  \"He is an old army pensioner. A weird bird, as shrewd as the dickens, in spite of his age a pretty powerful old fellow.\"  \"Oh, he's old,\" she said with some relief.  \"He's old, and in some ways, incapacitated. He hasn't the use of his right arm, and he's a bit groggy in one of his ankles as the result of a Boer bullet.\"  She laughed in spite of herself.  \"He doesn't sound a very attractive kind of guardian. He's a perfectly clean old bird, though I confess he doesn't look it, and he won't bother you or your servants. You can give him a room where he can sit, and you can give him a bit of bread and cheese, and a glass of beer, and he'll not bother you.\"  Lydia was amused now. It was absurd that Jack Glover should imagine she needed a guardian at all, but if he insisted, as he did, it would be better to have somebody as harmless as the unattractive Jaggs.  \"What time will he come?\"  \"At about ten o'clock every night, and he'll leave you at about seven in the morning. Unless you wish, you need never see him,\" said Jack.  \"How did you come to know him?\" she asked curiously.  \"I know everybody,\" said the boastful young man, \"you mustn't forget that I am a lawyer and have to meet very queer people.\"  He gathered up his papers and put them into his little bag.  \"And now what are your plans for to-day?\" he demanded.  She resented the self-imposed guardianship which he had undertaken, yet she could not forget what she owed him.  By some extraordinary means he had kept her out of the Meredith case and she had not been called as a witness at the inquest. Incidentally, in as mysterious a way he had managed to whitewash his partner and himself, although the Law Society were holding an inquiry of their own (this the girl did not know) it seemed likely that he would escape the consequence of an act which was a flagrant breach of the law.  \"I am going to Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's to tea,\" she said.  \"Mrs. Cole-Mortimer?\" he said quickly. \"How do you come to know that lady?\"  \"Really, Mr. Glover, you are almost impertinent,\" she smiled in spite of her annoyance. \"She came to call on me two or three days after that dreadful morning. She knew Mr. Meredith and was an old friend of the family's.\"  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Jack icily, \"she did not know Meredith, except to say 'how-do-you-do' to him, and she was certainly not a friend of the family. She is, however, a friend of Jean Briggerland.\"  \"Jean Briggerland!\" said the exasperated girl. \"Can't you forget her? You are like the man in Dickens's books--she's your King Charles's head! Really, for a respectable and a responsible lawyer, you're simply eaten up with prejudices. Of course, she was a friend of Mr. Meredith's. Why, she brought me a photograph of him taken when he was at Eton.\"  \"Supplied by Jean Briggerland,\" said the unperturbed Jack calmly, \"and if she'd brought you a pair of socks he wore when he was a baby I suppose you would have accepted those too.\"  \"Now you are being really abominable,\" said the girl, \"and I've got a lot to do.\"  He paused at the door.  \"Don't forget you can move into Cavendish Mansions to-morrow. I'll send the key round, and the day you move in, Jaggs will turn up for duty, bright and smiling. He doesn't talk a great deal----\"  \"I don't suppose you ever give the poor man a chance,\" she said cuttingly.     Chapter IX   Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was a representative of a numerous class of women who live so close to the border-line which separates good society from society which is not quite as good, that the members of either set thought she was in the other. She had a small house where she gave big parties, and nobody quite knew how this widow of an Indian colonel made both ends meet. It was the fact that her menage was an expensive one to maintain; she had a car, she entertained in London in the season, and disappeared from the metropolis when it was the correct thing to disappear, a season of exile which comes between the Goodwood Race Meeting in the south and the Doncaster Race Meeting in the north.  Lydia had been surprised to receive a visit from this elegant lady, and had readily accepted the story of her friendship with James Meredith. Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's invitation she had welcomed. She needed some distraction, something which would smooth out the ravelled threads of life which were now even more tangled than she had ever expected they could be.  Mr. Rennett had handed to her a thousand pounds the day after the wedding, and when she had recovered from the shock of possessing such a large sum, she hired a taxicab and indulged herself in a wild orgy of shopping.  The relief she experienced when he informed her he was taking charge of her affairs and settling the debts which had worried her for three years was so great that she felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her heart.  It was in one of her new frocks that Lydia, feeling more confident than usual, made her call. She had expected to find a crowd at the house in Hyde Park Crescent, and she was surprised when she was ushered into the drawing-room to find only four people present.  Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was a chirpy, pale little woman of forty-something. It would be ungallant to say how much that \"something\" represented. She came toward Lydia with outstretched hands.  \"My dear,\" she said with extravagant pleasure, \"I am glad you were able to come. You know Miss Briggerland and Mr. Briggerland?\"  Lydia looked up at the tall figure of the man she had seen in the stalls the night before her wedding and recognised him instantly.  \"Mr. Marcus Stepney, I don't think you have met.\"  Lydia bowed to a smart looking man of thirty, immaculately attired. He was very handsome, she thought, in a dark way, but he was just a little too \"new\" to please her. She did not like fashion-plate men, and although the most captious of critics could not have found fault with his correct attire, he gave her the impression of being over-dressed.  Lydia had not expected to meet Miss Briggerland and her father, although she had a dim recollection that Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had mentioned her name. Then in a flash she recalled the suspicions of Jack Glover, which she had covered with ridicule. The association made her feel a little uncomfortable, and Jean Briggerland, whose intuition was a little short of uncanny, must have read the doubt in her face.  \"Mrs. Meredith expected to see us, didn't she, Margaret?\" she said, addressing the twittering hostess. \"Surely you told her we were great friends?\"  \"Of course I did, my dear. Knowing your dear cousin and his dear father, it was not remarkable that I should know the whole of the family,\" and she smiled wisely from one to the other.  Of course! How absurd she was, thought Lydia. She had almost forgotten, and probably Jack Glover had forgotten too, that the Briggerlands and the Merediths were related.  She found herself talking in a corner of the room with the girl, and fell to studying her face anew. A closer inspection merely consolidated her earlier judgment. She smiled inwardly as she remembered Jack Glover's ridiculous warning. It was like killing a butterfly with a steam hammer, to loose so much vengeance against this frail piece of china.  \"And how do you feel now that you're very rich?\" asked Jean kindly.  \"I haven't realised it yet,\" smiled Lydia.  Jean nodded.  \"I suppose you have yet to settle with the lawyers. Who are they? Oh yes, of course Mr. Glover was poor Jim's solicitor.\" She sighed. \"I dislike lawyers,\" she said with a shiver, \"they are so heavily paternal! They feel that they and they only are qualified to direct your life and your actions. I suppose it is second nature with them. Then, of course, they make an awful lot of money out of commissions and fees, though I'm sure Jack Glover wouldn't worry about that. He's really a nice boy,\" she said earnestly, \"and I don't think you could have a better friend.\"  Lydia glowed at the generosity of this girl whom the man had so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],["title","The Angel of Terror (#8)"],["body","ned.  \"He has been very good to me,\" she said, \"although, of course, he is a little fussy.\"  Jean's lips twitched with amusement.  \"Has he warned you against me?\" she asked solemnly. \"Has he told you what a terrible ogre I am?\" And then without waiting for a reply: \"I sometimes think poor Jack is just a little--well, I wouldn't say mad, but a little queer. His dislikes are so violent. He positively loathes Margaret, though why I have never been able to understand.\"  \"He doesn't hate me,\" laughed Lydia, and Jean looked at her strangely.  \"No, I suppose not,\" she said. \"I can't imagine anybody hating you, Lydia. May I call you by your Christian name?\"  \"I wish you would,\" said Lydia warmly.  \"I can't imagine anybody hating you,\" repeated the girl thoughtfully. \"And, of course, Jack wouldn't hate you because you're his client--a very rich and attractive client too, my dear.\" She tapped the girl's cheek and Lydia, for some reason, felt foolish.  But as though unconscious of the embarrassment she had caused, Jean went on.  \"I don't really blame him, either. I've a shrewd suspicion that all these warnings against me and against other possible enemies will furnish a very excellent excuse for seeing you every day and acting as your personal bodyguard!\"  Lydia shook her head.  \"That part of it he has relegated already,\" she said, giving smile for smile. \"He has appointed Mr. Jaggs as my bodyguard.\"  \"Mr. Jaggs?\" The tone was even, the note of inquiry was not strained.  \"He's an old gentleman in whom Mr. Glover is interested, an old army pensioner. Beyond the fact that he hasn't the use of his right arm, and limps with his left leg, and that he likes beer and cheese, he seems an admirable watch dog,\" said Lydia humorously.  \"Jaggs?\" repeated the girl. \"I wonder where I've heard that name before. Is he a detective?\"  \"No, I don't think so. But Mr. Glover thinks I ought to have some sort of man sleeping in my new flat and Jaggs was duly engaged.\"  Soon after this Mr. Marcus Stepney came over and Lydia found him rather uninteresting. Less boring was Briggerland, for he had a fund of stories and experiences to relate, and he had, too, one of those soft soothing voices that are so rare in men.  It was dark when she came out with Mr. and Miss Briggerland, and she felt that the afternoon had not been unprofitably spent.  For she had a clearer conception of the girl's character, and was getting Jack Glover's interest into better perspective. The mercenary part of it made her just a little sick. There was something so mysterious, so ugly in his outlook on life, and there might not be a little self-interest in his care for her.  She stood on the step of the house talking to the girl, whilst Mr. Briggerland lit a cigarette with a patent lighter. Hyde Park Crescent was deserted save for a man who stood near the railings which protected the area of Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's house. He was apparently tying his shoe laces.  They went down on the sidewalk, and Mr. Briggerland looked for his car.  \"I'd like to take you home. My chauffeur promised to be here at four o'clock. These men are most untrustworthy.\"  From the other end of the Crescent appeared the lights of a car. At first Lydia thought it might be Mr. Briggerland's, and she was going to make her excuses for she wanted to go home alone. The car was coming too, at a tremendous pace. She watched it as it came furiously toward her, and she did not notice that Mr. Briggerland and his daughter had left her standing alone on the sidewalk and had withdrawn a few paces.  Suddenly the car made a swerve, mounted the sidewalk and dashed upon her. It seemed that nothing could save her, and she stood fascinated with horror, waiting for death.  Then an arm gripped her waist, a powerful arm that lifted her from her feet and flung her back against the railings, as the car flashed past, the mud-guard missing her by an inch. The machine pulled up with a jerk, and the white-faced girl saw Briggerland and Jean running toward her.  \"I should never have forgiven myself if anything had happened. I think my chauffeur must be drunk,\" said Briggerland in an agitated voice.  She had no words. She could only nod, and then she remembered her preserver, and she turned to meet the solemn eyes of a bent old man, whose pointed, white beard and bristling white eyebrows gave him a hawk-like appearance. His right hand was thrust into his pocket. He was touching his battered hat with the other.  \"Beg pardon, miss,\" he said raucously, \"name of Jaggs! And I have reported for dooty!\"     Chapter X   Jack Glover listened gravely to the story which the girl told. He had called at her lodgings on the following morning to secure her signature to some documents, and breathlessly and a little shamefacedly, she told him what had happened.  \"Of course it was an accident,\" she insisted, \"in fact, Mr. and Miss Briggerland were almost knocked down by the car. But you don't know how thankful I am your Mr. Jaggs was on the spot.\"  \"Where is he now?\" asked Jack.  \"I don't know,\" replied the girl. \"He just limped away without another word and I did not see him again, though I thought I caught a glimpse of him as I came into this house last night. How did he come to be on the spot?\" she asked curiously.  \"That is easily explained,\" replied Jack. \"I told the old boy not to let you out of his sight from sundown to sun up.\"  \"Then you think I'm safe during the day?\" she rallied him.  He nodded.  \"I don't know whether to laugh at you or to be very angry,\" she said, shaking her head reprovingly. \"Of course it was an accident!\"  \"I disagree with you,\" said Jack. \"Did you catch a glimpse of the chauffeur?\"  \"No,\" she said in surprise. \"I didn't think of looking at him.\"  He nodded.  \"If you had, you would probably have seen an old friend, namely, the gentleman who carried you off from the Erving Theatre,\" he said quietly.  It was difficult for Lydia to analyse her own feelings. She knew that Jack Glover was wrong, monstrously wrong. She was perfectly confident that his fantastic theory had no foundation, and yet she could not get away from his sincerity. Remembering Jean's description of him as \"a little queer\" she tried to fit that description into her knowledge of him, only to admit to herself that he had been exceptionally normal as far as she was concerned. The suggestion that his object was mercenary, and that he looked upon her as a profitable match for himself, she dismissed without consideration.  \"Anyway, I like your Mr. Jaggs,\" she said.  \"Better than you like me, I gather from your tone,\" smiled Jack. \"He's not a bad old boy.\"  \"He is a very strong old boy,\" she said. \"He lifted me as though I were a feather--I don't know now how I escaped. The steering gear went wrong,\" she explained unnecessarily.  \"Dear me,\" said Jack politely, \"and it went right again in time to enable the chauffeur to keep clear of Briggerland and his angel daughter!\"  She gave a gesture of despair.  \"You're hopeless,\" she said. \"These things happened in the dark ages; men and women do not assassinate one another in the twentieth century.\"  \"Who told you that?\" he demanded. \"Human nature hasn't changed for two thousand years. The instinct to kill is as strong as ever, or wars would be impossible. If any man or woman could commit one cold-blooded murder, there is no reason why he or she should not commit a hundred. In England, America, and France fifty cold-blooded murders are detected every year. Twice that number are undetected. It does not make the crime more impossible because the criminal is good looking.\"  \"You're hopeless,\" she said again, and Jack made no further attempt to convince her.  On the Thursday of that week she exchanged her lodgings for a handsome flat in Cavendish Place, and Mrs. Morgan had promised to join her a week later, when she had settled up her own business affairs.  Lydia was fortunate enough to get two maids from one of the agencies, one of whom was to sleep on the premises. The flat was not illimitable, and she regretted that she had promised to place a room at the disposal of the aged Mr. Jaggs. If he was awake all night as she presumed he would be, and slept in the day, he might have been accommodated in the kitchen, and she hinted as much to Jack. To her surprise the lawyer had turned down that idea.  \"You don't want your servants to know that you have a watchman.\"  \"What do you imagine they will think he is?\" she asked scornfully. \"How can I have an old gentleman in the flat without explaining why he is there?\"  \"Your explanation could be that he did the boots.\"  \"It wouldn't take him all night to do the boots. Of course, I'm too grateful to him to want him to do anything.\"  Mr. Jaggs reported again for duty that night. He came at half-past nine, a shabby-looking old man, and Lydia, who had not yet got used to her new magnificence, came out into the hall to meet him.  He was certainly not a prepossessing object, and Lydia discovered that, in addition to his other misfortunes, he had a slight squint.  \"I hadn't an opportunity of thanking you the other day, Mr. Jaggs,\" she said. \"I think you saved my life.\"  \"That's all right, miss,\" he said, in his hoarse voice. \"Dooty is dooty!\"  She thought he was looking past her, till she realised that his curious slanting line of vision was part of his infirmity.  \"I'll show you to your room,\" she said hastily.  She led the way down the corridor, opened the door of a small room which had been prepared for him, and switched on the light.  \"Too much light for me, miss,\" said the old man, shaking his head. \"I like to sit in the dark and listen, that's what I like, to sit in the dark and listen.\"  \"But you can't sit in the dark, you'll want to read, won't you?\"  \"Can't read, miss,\" said Jaggs cheerfully. \"Can't write, either. I don't know that I'm any worse off.\"  Reluctantly she switched out the light.  \"But you won't be able to see your food.\"  \"I can feel for that, miss,\" he said with a"]]]
