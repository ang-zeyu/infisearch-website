They trembled as they heard that bell and came nearer and nearer to the grand square tower.  They eyed furtively everyone who passed them on the road, and imagined every man a master and every boy a Templetonian.  A shop with \"mortar-boards\" displayed in its window seemed like a temple crowded with shrines; and a confectioner's shop, in which two young gentlemen in gowns sat and refreshed themselves, was like a distant glimpse of Olympus where the gods banqueted.  A boy with a towel over his shoulder lounged past them, and surveyed them listlessly as he went by.  How they cowered and trembled beneath that scrutiny!  How they dreaded lest their jackets might be too long, or that the studs in their shirts might not be visible!  How they hated themselves for blushing, and wished to goodness they knew what to do with their hands!  How their legs shook beneath them as they came under the shadow of the great tower and looked nervously for the porter's lodge!  They would have liked to look as if they knew the place; it seemed so foolish to have to ask any one where the porter lived.  \"Just go and see if it's up that passage,\" said Richardson to Coote, pointing out a narrow opening on one side of the tower.  Coote looked at the place doubtfully.  \"Hadn't we better all try?\" said he.  \"What's the good?  Beckon if it's right, and we'll come.\"  The unfortunate Coote departed on his quest much as a man who walks into a cave where a bear possibly resides.  His companions meanwhile occupied themselves with examining the gateway and trying to appear as if architectural curiosity and nothing else had been the object of their passing visit to Templeton.  In a few minutes Coote reappeared with a long face.  \"Well? is it right?\"  \"No; it's a dust-bin.\"  The great clock above them began to boom out ten.  \"We must find out somehow,\" said Richardson.  \"We'd better ask at this door.\"  And, to the alarm of his companions, he boldly tapped on a door under the gate.  A man in uniform opened it.  \"Well, young gentlemen, what's your pleasure?\"  \"Please can you tell us where the porter's lodge is?\" said Richardson, in his most persuasive tone.  \"I can.  I'm the porter, and this is the lodge.  What do you want?\"  \"Please we're Mr Ashford's boys, come for the examination.  Here's a note from Mr Ashford for Dr Winter.\"  The porter took the note, and bade the panic-stricken trio follow him across the quadrangle.  What a walk that was!  Across that noble square, with its two great elm- trees laden with noisy rooks; with its wide-fenced lawn and sun-dial; with its cloisters and red brick houses; with its sculptures and Latin mottoes.  And even all these were as nothing to the few boys who loitered about in its enclosure--some pacing arm-in-arm, some hurrying with books under their arms, some diverting themselves more or less noisily, some shouting or whistling or singing--all at home in the place; and all unlike the three trembling victims who trotted in the wake of the porter towards the dreadful hall of examination.  At the door, Richardson felt a frantic clutch on his arm.  \"Oh!  I say, Dick,\" gasped Coote, holding out a shaking ringer, with a legend on its nail, \"whatever is this the date for--1476?  I put it down, and-- Oh!  I say, can't you remember?\"  But Richardson, though he scorned to show it, was too agitated even to suggest an event to fit the disconsolate date, and poor Coote had to totter up the stairs, hopelessly convinced that he had nothing at his fingers' ends after all.  They found themselves walking up a long, high-ceilinged room, with desks all round and a few very appalling oil portraits ranged along the walls, to a table where sat a small, handsome gentleman in cap and gown.  He took Mr Ashford's letter, and the boys knew they stood in the presence of Dr Winter.  \"Richardson, Heathcote, Coote,\" said the Doctor.  \"Answer to your names--which is Richardson?\"  \"I am, please, sir.\"  \"Heathcote?\"  \"I am, sir, please.\"  \"Coote?\"  \"I am, if you please, sir.\"  \"Richardson, go to desk 6; Heathcote, desk 13; Coote, desk 25.\"  Coote groaned inwardly.  It was all up with him now, and he might just as well throw up the sponge before he began.  With a friend within call he might yet have struggled through.  But what hope was there when the nearer of them was twelve desks away?  For two hours a solemn silence reigned in that examination hall, broken only by the scratching of pens and the secret sighs of one and another of the victims.  The pictures on the walls, as they looked down, caught the eye of many a wistful upturned face, and marked the devouring of many a penholder, and the tearing of many a hair.  In vain Coote searched his nails from thumb to little finger.  No question fitted to his painfully collected answers.  Edward the Fifth was ignored, the sex of \"Amnis\" was not even hinted at, and \"1476\" never once came to his rescue.  And yet, he reminded himself over and over again, he and Heathcote had said their Latin syntax to Mr Ashford only the day before without a mistake.  \"Cease writing,\" said the Doctor, as the clock struck two, \"and the boys at desks 1 to 10 come up here.\"  This was the signal for the cruellest of all that day's horrors.  If the written examination had slain its thousands, the _viva voce_ slew its tens of thousands.  Even Richardson stumbled; and Heathcote, when his turn came, gave himself up for lost.  The Doctor's impassive face betrayed no emotion, and gave no token, either for joy, or hope, or despair.  He merely said \"That will do\" after each victim had performed; and even when Coote, after a mighty effort, rendered \"O tempora!  O mores!\" as \"Oh, the tempers of the Moors,\" he quietly said, \"Thank you; now the next boy.\"  At last it was all over, and they found themselves standing once more in the great quadrangle, not very sure what had happened to them, but feeling as if they had just undergone a surgical operation not unlike that of flaying alive.  However, once outside the terrible portal of Templeton, their hearts gradually thawed within them.  The confectioner's shop, now crowded with \"gods,\" held them in awe for a season, and as long as the road was specked with mortar-boards they held their peace, and meditated on their shirt-studs.  But when Templeton lay behind them, and they stepped once more on to the breezy heath, they shook off the nightmare that weighed on their spirits and were themselves again.  \"Precious glad it's over,\" said Richardson.  \"Beast, that arithmetic paper was.\"  \"I liked it better than the English,\" said Coote.  \"I say, is 'for' a preposition or an adverb?  I couldn't remember.\"  \"Oh, look here! shut up riddles now,\" said Richardson, \"we've had enough of them.  Let's talk about our three and not your 'for,' you Coote you.\"  Whereupon Richardson started to run, a proceeding which at once convinced his companions that his last observation had been intended as a joke.  As in duty bound they gave chase, but the fleet-footed Dick was too many for them; and when at last they came up with him he was strongly intrenched on the box-seat of the empty waggonette at Markridge, with Tom's whip in his hand, beyond all attack.  \"I say,\" said he, after his pursuers had taken breath and granted an amnesty, \"it would be great fun to drive home by ourselves.  Tom's not here.  I asked them.  He's gone to see his aunt, or somebody, and left word he'd be back at three o'clock.  Like his cheek.  I vote we don't wait for him.\"  \"All serene,\" said the others, \"but we shall want the horse, shan't we?\"  \"Perhaps we shall,\" said Dick, with a grin, \"unless you'd like to pull the trap.  The horse is in the stable, and we can tip the fellow to put him in for us.\"  The \"fellow\" was quite amenable to this sort of persuasion, and grinningly complied with the whim of the young gentlemen; secretly enjoying the prospect of Tom's dismay.  \"'Taint no concern of mine,\" said he, philosophically.  \"If you tells me to do it, I does it.\"  \"And if we tells you to open your mouth and shut your eyes, and you'll find sixpence in your hand,--you'll find it there,\" said Dick.  \"Of course you knows how to drive,\" said the stableman.  \"Rather!  Do you think we're babies?  Here, shy us the reins.  Come along, you fellows, there's room for all three on the box.  Now then, Joe, give her her head.  Come up, you beast!  Swish!  See if we don't make her step out.  Let her go!\"  With some misgivings, Joe obeyed, and next moment the waggonette swayed majestically out of the yard very much like a small steam-tug going out of harbour in half a cap of wind.  \"Rum, the way she pitches,\" said Dick presently; \"she didn't do it when we came.\"  \"Looks to me as if the horse wasn't quite sober,\" suggested Coote.  \"Perhaps, if you pulled both reins at the same time, instead of one at a time,\" put in Heathcote, \"she wouldn't wobble so much.\"  \"You duffer; she'd stop dead, if I did that.\"  \"Suppose you don't pull either,\" said Heathcote.  Richardson pooh-poohed the notion, but acted on it all the same, with highly satisfactorily results.  The trap glided along smoothly, and all anxiety as to the management of the mare appeared to be at an end.  \"I left word for Tom,\" said Richardson, \"if he stepped out, he'd catch us up.  Ha, ha!  Won't he be wild?\"  \"Wonder if he'll get us in a row with Ashford?\" said Heathcote.  \"Not he.  What's the harm?  Just a little horse-play, that's all.\"  Heathcote and Coote became grave.  \"Look here,\" said the former, \"we let you off last time, but you'll catch it now.  Collar him that side, Coote, and have him over.\"  \"Don't be an idiot, Heathcote,\" cried the Jehu, as he found himself suddenly seized on either hand.  \"Let go, while I'm driving.  Do you hear, Coote; let go, or there'll be a smash!\"  But as \"letting go\" was an accomplishment not taught at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20991"],["title","Follow My Leader: The Boys of Templeton (#2)"],["body","House, Richardson had to adopt stronger measures than mere persuasion in order to clear himself of his embarrassments.  Dropping the reins and flinging his arms vehemently back, he managed to dislodge his assailants, though not without dislodging himself at the same time, and a long and somewhat painful creditors' meeting down in the waggonette was the consequence.  The mare, whose patience had been gradually evaporating during this strange journey, conscious of the riot behind her, and feeling the reins dropping loosely over her tail, took the whole matter very much to heart, and showed her disapproval of the whole proceedings by taking to her heels and bolting straight away.  The business meeting inside stood forthwith adjourned.  With scared faces, the boys struggled to their feet, and, holding on to the rail of the box-seat, peered over to ascertain the cause of this alarming diversion.  \"It's a bolt!\" said Richardson, the only one of the three who retained wits enough to think or speak.  \"Hang on, you fellows; I'll try and get the reins.  Help me up!\"  As well as the swaying of the vehicle would allow it, they helped him hoist himself up on to the box.  But for a long time all his efforts to catch the reins were in vain, and once or twice it seemed as if nothing could save him from being pitched off his perch on to the road.  Luckily the mare kept a straight course, and at length, by a tremendous stretch, well supported from the rear by his faithful comrades, the boy succeeded in reaching the reins and pulling them up over the mare's tail.  \"Hang on now!\" said he; \"we're all right if I can only guide her.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  HOW OUR HEROES FALL OUT AND YET REMAIN FRIENDS.  Mountjoy House had a narrow escape that afternoon of losing three of its most promising pupils.  The boys themselves by no means realised the peril of their situation. Indeed, after the first alarm, and finding that, by clinging tightly to the rail of the box-seat, they could support themselves on their feet on the floor of the swinging vehicle, Heathcote and Coote began almost to enjoy it, and were rather sorry one or two of the Templeton boys were not at hand to see how Mountjoy did things.  Richardson, however, with the reins in his hands, but utterly powerless to check the headlong career of the mare, or to do anything but guide her, took a more serious view of the situation, and heartily wished the drive was at an end.  It was a flat road all the way to Mountjoy--no steep hill to breathe the runaway, and no ploughed field to curb her ardour.  It was a narrow road, too, so narrow that, for two vehicles to pass one another, it was necessary for one of the two to draw up carefully at the very verge. And as the verge in the present case meant the edge of rather a steep embankment, the prospect was not altogether a cheering one for an inexperienced boy, who, if he knew very little about driving, knew quite well that everything depended on his own nerve and coolness.  And Richardson not only had a head, but knew how to keep it.  With a rein tightly clutched in each hand, with his feet firmly pressed against the footboard, with a sharp eye out over the mare's ears, and a grim twitch on his determined mouth, he went over the chances in his own mind.  \"If she goes on like this, we shall get to Mountjoy in half an hour. What a pace!  We're bound to smash up before we get there!  Perhaps these fellows had better try and jump for it.  Hallo! lucky we didn't go over that stone!  Wonder if I could pull her up if I got on her back? She might kick up and smash the trap!  Wonder if she will pull up, or go over the bank, or what?  Tom--Tom will have to run hard to catch us. Whew! what a swing!  I could have sworn we were over!\"  This last peril, and the involuntary cry of the two boys clinging on behind him, silenced even this mental soliloquy for a bit.  But the waggonette, after two or three desperate plunges, righted itself and continued its mad career at the heels of the mare.  \"What would happen if we went over?  Jolly awkward to get pitched over on to my head or down among the mare's feet!  She'd kick, I guess! Those fellows inside could jump and-- By Jove! there comes something on the road!  We're in for it now!  Either a smash, or over the bank, or-- Hallo! there's a gate open!\"  This last inward exclamation was caused by the sight of an open gate some distance ahead, through which a rough cart-track branched off from the road towards the sand-hills on the left.  Richardson, with the instinct of desperation, seized upon this as the only way of escape from the peril which threatened them.  \"Look out, you fellows!\" cried he; \"hang on tight on the right side while we turn, and jump well out if we go over.\"  They watched him breathlessly as they came towards the gate.  The vehicle which was meeting them and their own were about equal distance from the place, and it was clear their fate must be settled in less than a minute.  Richardson waved to the driver of the approaching cart to pull up, and at the same time edged the mare as far as he could on to the off-side of the road, so as to give her a wide turn in.  \"Now for it!\" said he to himself, pulling the left rein; \"if this don't do, I'll give up driving.\"  The mare, perhaps weary, perhaps perplexed at the sight of the cart in front, perhaps ready for a new diversion, obeyed the lead and swerved off at the gate.  For a moment the waggonette tottered on its left wheel, and, but for the weight of the two passengers on the other side, would have caught the gate post and shattered itself to atoms in the narrow passage.  As it was, it cleared the peril by an inch, and then, plunging on to the soft, rough track, capsized gently, mare and all, landing its three occupants a yard or two off with their noses in the mud.  It was an undignified end to an heroic drive, and Richardson, as he picked himself up and cleared the mud from his eyes, felt half disappointed that no bones were broken or joints dislocated after all. Coote did certainly contribute a grain of consolation by announcing that he _believed_ one of his legs was broken.  But even this hope of glory was short-lived, for that young hero finding no one at leisure to assist him to his feet rose by himself, and walked some distance to a grass bank where he could sit down and examine for himself the extent of his injuries.  \"Wal, young squire,\" said a voice at Dick's side, as that young gentleman found eyesight enough to look about him, \"you've done it this time.\"  The owner of the voice was the driver of the cart, and the tones and looks with which he made the remark were anything but unflattering to Richardson.  \"It was a close squeak through the gate,\" said the latter, \"not six inches either side; and if it hadn't been for the ruts we should have kept up all right till now.  I say, do you think the trap's damaged, or the mare?\"  The mare was lying very comfortably on her side taking a good breath after her race, and not offering to resume her feet.  As for the waggonette it was lying equally comfortably on its side, with one wheel up in the air.  \"Shaft broken,\" said the driver, \"that's all.\"  \"That's all!\" said Dick, dolefully, \"we shall catch it, and no mistake.\"  The man grinned.  \"You can't expect to play games of that sort without scratching the varnish off,\" said he.  \"No fault of yours you haven't got your necks broke.\"  \"Suppose we try to get her up?\" said Richardson, looking as if this last information had very little comfort in it.  So among them they unharnessed the mare and managed to disengage her from the vehicle and get her to her feet.  \"She's all sound,\" said the man, after a careful overhauling.  \"She's a cad,\" said Dick, \"and I shouldn't have been sorry if she'd broken her neck.  Look at the smash she's made.\"  The trap was indeed far worse damaged than they supposed as first.  Not only was a shaft broken, but a wheel was off, and the rail all along one side was torn away.  It was clear there was no more driving to be got out of it that afternoon, and the boys gave up the attempt to raise it in disgust.  \"Do you know Tom, our man--Ashford's man?\" said Dick.  \"Who?  Tom Tranter?  Yes, I knows him.\"  \"Well, you'll meet him on the road between here and Markridge, walking, or perhaps running.  Tell him we've had a spill and he'd better see after the trap, will you?  We'll go on.\"  \"What about the horse, though?\" said Heathcote.  \"I suppose we shall have to take the beast along with us.  We can't leave her here.\"  \"I think we'd better stop till Tom comes, and all go on together,\" suggested Heathcote.  \"I suppose you funk it with Ashford,\" said Dick whose temper was somewhat ruffled by misfortune.  \"I don't.  If you two like to stop you can.  I'll go on with the mare.\"  \"Oh, no, we'll all come,\" said Heathcote.  \"I'm not afraid, no more is Coote.\"  \"All serene then, come on.  Mind you tell Tom, I say,\" added he to the carter.  \"Good-bye, and thanks awfully.\"  And they departed in doleful procession, Dick, with the whip in his hand, leading the mare by the mouth, and Heathcote and Coote following like chief mourners, just out of range of the animal's heels.  \"What shall we say to Ashford?\" asked Heathcote, after a little.  \"Say?  What do you mean?\" said Dick.  \"He's sure to ask us what has happened.\"  \"Well, we shall tell him, I suppose.\"  \"There'll be an awful row.\"  \"Of course there will.\"  \"We shall get licked.\"  \"Of course we shall.  What of it?\"  \"Only,\" said Heathcote, with a little hesitation, \"I suppose there's no way of getting out of it?\"  \"Not unless you tell lies.  You and Coote can tell some if you like--I shan't.\"  \"I'm not going to tell any,\" said Coote, \"I've told quite enough in my exam. papers.\"  \"Oh, of course, I don't mean telling crams,\" said Heathcote, who really didn't exactly know what he did mean.  \"I'll back you up, old man.\"  \"Thanks.  I say, as we are in a row, mightn't we just as well take it out"]]]
