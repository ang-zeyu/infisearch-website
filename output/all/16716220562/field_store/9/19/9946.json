The astonishing       natural advantages of this poor boy—his beauty, his readiness,       the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery       atmosphere—had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an       arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into       prejudices against him. Irascible, envious—bad enough, but not       the worst, for these salient angles were all varnished over with       a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented themselves in       sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and, what       was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the       true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to       rise which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the       esteem or the love of his species; only the hard wish to       succeed—not shine, not serve—succeed, that he might have the       right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit.        “We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes       upon his literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in       his earlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or       three years—including much of his best poetry—was in some sense       biographical; in draperies of his imagination, those who had       taken the trouble to trace his steps, could perceive, but       slightly concealed, the figure of himself.”        Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written       sketch, let us truthfully say:        Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this       city, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic       and sub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with       him. He resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles       out of town, but was at his desk in the office, from nine in the       morning till the evening paper went to press. With the highest       admiration for his genius, and a willingness to let it atone for       more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common report to       expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and       occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,       however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his       pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what       genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him       always with deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request       that he would not probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would       erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against       society and mankind, he readily and courteously assented—far more       yielding than most men, we thought, on points so excusably       sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in another       periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment with       us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but       one presentment of the man—a quiet, patient, industrious, and       most gentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good       feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability.        Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours       of leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place       of business, and we met him often in the street—invariably the       same sad mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had       always known him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his       death, that we knew of any other development of manner or       character. We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be       stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that,       with a single glass of wine, his whole nature was reversed, the       demon became uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of       intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane.       Possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such       times, and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and       memory, he easily seemed personating only another phase of his       natural character, and was accused, accordingly, of insulting       arrogance and bad-heartedness. In this reversed character, we       repeat, it was never our chance to see him. We know it from       hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity       of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the       ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.        The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe       was generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this       reversed phase of his character. Under that degree of       intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of       truth and right, he doubtless said and did much that was wholly       irreconcilable with his better nature; but, when himself, and as       we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected humility, as to his       own deservings, were a constant charm to his character. His       letters, of which the constant application for autographs has       taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,       exhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly       written notes of which we chance still to retain possession, for       instance, he speaks of “The Raven”—that extraordinary poem which       electrified the world of imaginative readers, and has become the       type of a school of poetry of its own—and, in evident earnest,       attributes its success to the few words of commendation with       which we had prefaced it in this paper. It will throw light on       his sane character to give a literal copy of the note:  “FORDHAM, _April_ 20, 1849        “MY DEAR WILLIS—The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain       as to hope you will like, in some respects, has been just       published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to       write, now and then. It pays well as times go-but unquestionably       it ought to pay ten prices; for whatever I send it I feel I am       consigning to the tomb of the Capulets. The verses accompanying       this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to       light in the ‘Home Journal?’ If you can oblige me so far as to       copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the       ——,’ that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late —— paper,’       would do.        “I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made       ‘The Raven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have       done me the honor of attributing to you), therefore, I _would_       ask you (if I dared) to say something of these lines if they       please you.  “Truly yours ever, “EDGAR A. POE.”        In double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for       himself, and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been       denied him, we give another of the only three of his notes which       we chance to retain:  “FORDHAM, _January_ 22, 1848.        “MY DEAR MR. WILLIS—I am about to make an effort at       re-establishing myself in the literary world, and _feel_ that I       may depend upon your aid.        “My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The       Stylus,’ but it would be useless to me, even when established, if       not entirely out of the control of a publisher. I mean,       therefore, to get up a journal which shall be _my own_ at all       points. With this end in view, I must get a list of at least five       hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two hundred I have       already. I propose, however, to go South and West, among my       personal and literary friends—old college and West Point       acquaintances—and see what I can do. In order to get the means of       taking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society       Library, on Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be       no cause of _squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary_ at       all. I have chosen a broad text: ‘The Universe.’        “Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the       rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity.       Gratefully, _most gratefully,_  “Your friend always, “EDGAR A. POE.”        Brief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they       sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to       Mr. Poe-humility, willingness to persevere, belief in another’s       friendship, and capability of cordial and grateful friendship!       Such he assuredly was when sane. Such only he has invariably       seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to know of him,       through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier is       it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of       only, that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these       descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like       portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in       health.        But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible       evidence that there was _goodness_ in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it       we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which       sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty; but we think it       may be excused, if so we can brighten the memory of the poet,       even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it       may render to the nearest link broken by his death.        Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a       call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us       as the mother of his wife. She was in search of employment for       him, and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill,       that her daughter was a confirmed invalid, and that their       circumstances were such as compelled her taking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2147"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 1 (#5)"],["body"," upon herself.       The countenance of this lady, made beautiful and saintly with an       evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and       sorrowful tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging its       plea, her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined       manners, and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the       claims and abilities of her son, disclosed at once the presence       of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be.       It was a hard fate that she was watching over. Mr. Poe wrote with       fastidious difficulty, and in a style too much above the popular       level to be well paid. He was always in pecuniary difficulty,       and, with his sick wife, frequently in want of the merest       necessaries of life. Winter after winter, for years, the most       touching sight to us, in this whole city, has been that tireless       minister to genius, thinly and insufficiently clad, going from       office to office with a poem, or an article on some literary       subject, to sell, sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice       that he was ill, and begging for him, mentioning nothing but that       “he was ill,” whatever might be the reason for his writing       nothing, and never, amid all her tears and recitals of distress,       suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a       doubt of him, or a complaint, or a lessening of pride in his       genius and good intentions. Her daughter died a year and a half       since, but she did not desert him. She continued his ministering       angel—living with him, caring for him, guarding him against       exposure, and when he was carried away by temptation, amid grief       and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his       self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering,       _begging_ for him still. If woman’s devotion, born with a first       love, and fed with human passion, hallow its object, as it is       allowed to do, what does not a devotion like this—pure,       disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible spirit—say       for him who inspired it?        We have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on       the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her       untiring care. It is merely a request that we would call upon       her, but we will copy a few of its words—sacred as its privacy       is—to warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above, and       add force to the appeal we wish to make for her:        “I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie....       Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not       desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. ——       to come, as I must deliver a message to him from my poor       Eddie.... I need not ask you to notice his death and to speak       well of him. I know you will. But say what an affectionate son he       was to me, his poor desolate mother...”        To hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there,       between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the       story of such a woman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do,       in delicacy, by making it public, we feel—other reasons       aside—that it betters the world to make known that there are such       ministrations to its erring and gifted. What we have said will       speak to some hearts. There are those who will be glad to know       how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away       recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they may       send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction,       some token of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any,       far or near, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through       the remainder of her life, we will joyfully place it in her       hands.     THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAAL (*1)         By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high       state of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there       occurred of a nature so completely unexpected—so entirely       novel—so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions—as to       leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an       uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy       together by the ears.        It appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not positive about the       date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically       mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in       the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was       warm—unusually so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air       stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and       then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration,       that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a       fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless,       about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in       the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded;       and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned       toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously       from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could       be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded       long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of       Rotterdam.        The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From       behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of       cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open       area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid       substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not       to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently       admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed       below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils       in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one       could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the       mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one       to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth,       and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed,       paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly—then waddled       back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed again.        In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly       city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so       much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be       accurately discerned. It appeared to be—yes! it was undoubtedly a       species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen       in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon       manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland       certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or       rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing       in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of       the precise material which no one had ever before known to be       used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the       good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the       phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or       nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this       similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer       inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its       apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of       little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a       continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.       Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,       there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a       brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black       band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable       that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat       repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard       it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon       sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and       declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now       this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with       three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about       five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and       up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of       obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be       sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a       quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a       retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went       so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been       committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans       Pfaall and his associates. But to return.        The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to       within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a       sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This       was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been       more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it       was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and       tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention       of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on       "]]]
