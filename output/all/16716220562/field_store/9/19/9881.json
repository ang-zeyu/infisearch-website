We had already, according to our calculation, performed the distance to Mr Strong's station, but no signs of it could we discover.  The heat was oppressive, and seeing a wood on our left, we were assured from the nature of the trees, that either a water-hole or a stream would be found.  We agreed to camp there for a couple of hours to let our horses feed and to take our dinner, hoping then by pushing on that we should before evening at all events arrive at the station.  I had ridden forward to look out for the water, when just as I caught sight of the glitter of a pool, I saw two persons emerge from the shade.  They were white lads with a couple of dogs and had guns in their hands.  So intent were they on some object before them that they did not perceive me.  One of them fired at an opossum which they had, I concluded, driven out of its hole.  The animal fell to the ground, when they dashed forward to save it from being torn to pieces by the dogs.  As they did so, one of them looked up and saw me watching them.  \"Hallo!  Where do you come from?\" he exclaimed advancing.  \"From England,\" I answered.  \"We want to reach Mr Strong's station, and shall be obliged if you will help us to find it.\"  \"That's where we live, so we can take you to it,\" replied the lad.  \"You have, however, come somewhat out of your way, and must have passed it on your right.\"  I thanked him.  \"And who are you?\"  I asked.  \"We are Mr Strong's sons,\" he replied.  \"We came here to look for some stray cattle which are hid in this scrub, so we shall first have to drive them out, but that won't take us long.  We left our horses hobbled close at hand while we stopped, intending to take our dinner, as we have been out since the morning.\"  \"We were going to do the same,\" I observed.  \"Here comes my brother Guy; if you haven't eaten your dinner you'll join us, won't you?\"  \"Of course!\" he said laughing.  \"And I conclude that you are Guy and Maurice Thurston, our cousins we have been expecting out from the old country for some months past.  My name is Hector.  That is my brother Oliver.  I suppose you have heard of us?\"  I had to confess that I had not before heard their names, though I did not like to say how little I knew about them.  Guy, Toby, and I, having dismounted and allowed our horses to drink at the pool, hobbled them and let them go away to feed, while we sat down in a shady spot to discuss our provisions.  Our cousins produced damper, cold beef and cheese from their pockets; while Toby placed before us a piece of a kangaroo which we had shot the previous day and some biscuits, while we all contented ourselves with a draught of water from the pool.  The meal was quickly despatched, when our cousins jumped up saying that they must look out for the cattle, and that as soon as we saw the herd rounded up and clear of the scrub, we might follow in the rear.  They advised us to take care should any of them charge us, as they were apt to be vicious, and Toby might have a difficulty in escaping.  \"You need not hurry yourselves,\" they added, \"but when you hear the sound of our stock whips, you had better mount and be ready to start.\"  Guy and I agreed that it was very fortunate we had fallen in with our cousins, who seemed to be wonderfully hardy fellows, and we hoped might prove good companions.  We waited a short time, when we heard, coming from some distance, apparently, the sharp report of the whips, like the sound of crackers. Now the sounds, mingled with a chorus of lowing and bellowing, reached us from one side, now from the other, every moment approaching nearer, so that we agreed that it would be wise to catch our horses and mount. We were quickly in our saddles, when several bulls burst out of the scrub a short distance from us.  We rode forward to get out of their way as they looked very much inclined to charge us.  Presently others appeared in different directions, and then our two young cousins, cracking their long whips, followed, rounding up the cattle in the most scientific manner, and turning several cows which with their calves were evidently intent on bolting back into the scrub.  We soon got excited with the scene, and although our horses were somewhat tired and we had no stock whips, we managed so effectually to turn the cattle with our ordinary riding-whips, that our cousins declared we assisted them very much.  The mob once collected went on steadily until we got them into the paddock, an enclosure half a mile in extent, into which, some bars being removed, most of them eagerly rushed.  A few however tried to bolt, but were sent back by the stock whips, and all were fortunately turned in; some to be used for beef, others for branding, while the cows were wanted for milking.  \"Where is the station?\"  I asked.  \"I can see only this immense paddock.\"  \"There!\" answered Hector, pointing to where I caught sight of the roofs of several low buildings.  \"We shall soon be there.\"  We put our horses into a canter, and in a short time arrived before a collection of buildings like Indian bungalows, the centre of which was the dwelling house, which had slab walls and shingled roof, with a pretty verandah in front.  A stout gentleman, a few grey hairs sprinkling his head and large bushy beard, came out to meet us, and on hearing from Hector who we were, welcomed us cordially.  Our cousins took our horses, which they turned into a small paddock containing a shed at one end to afford shelter to the animals.  We then entered the house, where we were introduced to the hostess, a tall lady, somewhat sallow and careworn, but with considerable animation in her manner.  We were next made known to three young ladies, two of whom we understood were Misses Strong and a third Clara Mayne, a friend; besides these there were three young children.  In a short time, two tall lads, sunburnt, and sinewy, made their appearance with stock whips in their hands and broad-brimmed hats on their heads.  \"You have not seen them all yet,\" observed our hostess.  Two more young men came in, one somewhat older than Guy, the other about my own age, and I found that they also were cousins.  Altogether a goodly company sat down to the evening meal.  We all waited on ourselves, there being no female helps in the household.  A rattling conversation was kept up, the young men describing to their father the events of the day, while we had to give an account of our adventures from the time of our landing.  They were all highly interested in hearing of Bracewell being stuck up by bushrangers and how we had rescued him.  \"We must put a stop to the career of those gentlemen,\" observed Mr Strong.  \"We have heard before this of their doings, and I have even considered it prudent not to leave the ladies alone in the house without two or three men as guards; a most abominable inconvenience, and yet, from knowing the atrocities of which they are capable, I consider it absolutely necessary.\"  The blacks, he said, had also been troublesome.  A large mob who had been wandering about in that part of the country, might, he thought it possible, take it into their heads, to pay the station a visit; though it was not likely that they would do harm should they find his people prepared for them.  After a pleasant evening, we were shown to the room we were to occupy in one of the other sheds where three of our cousins also slept.  One of the elder ones was called in the night to mount guard, and we found that a watch was regularly kept in case either bushrangers or blacks should make their appearance.  Next morning our cousins invited us to accompany them to drive in another mob of cattle for the purpose of mustering and branding the calves.  We proposed riding our own horses, but they laughed at the notion.  \"You'd get run down to a certainty,\" said Hector.  \"As we go along I'll tell you what you'll have to do, for there's nothing like beginning at once.\"  We were in the saddle before daylight, having first breakfasted, when we found a mob of sixty or eighty tame cattle, a short distance from the station.  \"What are they for?\"  I asked.  \"They are coaches!\" answered Hector.  \"We use them to entice the wild ones, who take shelter among them, and then the whole are more easily driven into the stock yards.\"  The animals quietly pursued their way, going wherever their drivers chose to direct them.  We mustered a dozen horsemen.  On arriving close to the run where the wild cattle were known to be, three of the men remained with the coaches, and the rest of us rode forward, dividing into two parties, the one going to the right, the other to the left, so as to encircle the whole camp,--the name given to the spot where the wild cattle congregate.  The country had a very wild appearance, there were rocks and hills and fallen trees in all directions, and I guessed that we should have a pretty rough ride.  Our object was to drive the cattle towards the coaches and to prevent any of them turning back and breaking through the line we formed in their rear.  We were accompanied, I should have said, by a pack of dogs, of a somewhat mongrel appearance, of all sizes and shapes.  On arriving at the camp one of the best mounted stockmen went ahead to lead the cattle, which curiously enough always follow where they see another animal going, and now the work began.  Cracking our whips and shouting at the top of our voices, off we started over the rough ground, now dashing up a hill, now descending the steep side of another, our animals springing and dodging about to avoid rocks and other obstructions.  Now we leaped over trees, twisting and turning in every direction to avoid the standing stumps and jumping over scattered logs; now we had to force our way through a thick patch of saplings which caught us as in a net.  Not occasionally but _every_ moment some of the cattle would turn and attempt to break through, some of our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21383"],["title","Adventures in Australia (#8)"],["body","having immediately to wheel round, with loud cracks of their whips, and make the beasts head the other way.  None of us seemed to think of the danger we were running.  Though Guy and I were good horsemen it was pretty hard work for us, and our whips were but of little use as we could not make them crack like the rest of the party. The cows gave us most trouble, but the dogs hung on to the animals, some catching them by the nose, others by the heels or tails, not ceasing to worry them until they took the required direction.  As we were riding along, after we had got free of the bush, a huge bull made a dash out, attempting to escape.  I galloped after him, belabouring him with my whip, and in spite of his continuing to try and toss me, turned him back into the herd.  \"Well done, Maurice,\" exclaimed Hector, \"you'll make a first-rate stockman, but you must practise with your whip before you can become as expert as is necessary.\"  We visited, in the course of a day or two, other camps in which the wild cattle were collected in the same fashion; when, led by the coaches, the whole were driven into the yards, as they are called, situated at the head station.  Here they were allowed to remain until next morning when the operation of mustering and branding commenced.  The yard was so divided that the cattle required for the various purposes were driven into different compartments; the calves into one, the cattle to be slaughtered into another, and those to be turned loose again, into a third, while the stockmen from two or three neighbouring stations attended to claim any of their masters' cattle which had got in among Mr Strong's.  A calf having been lassoed, it was hauled up and its head held down by a plank, when a hot brand was handed to a man standing ready to press it against the creature's skin, where an indelible mark was left, when the little bellower was allowed to rise and make its escape into another pen.  Guy and I were not of much use, but we saw everything going forward, and lent a hand whenever we could.  \"Now, my lads,\" said Mr Strong to us the next day; \"I see the stuff you are made of.  You'll do, and if you like to remain with me to learn all you ought to know, you are welcome; after that you can decide what course you will follow.\"  We had been some days at the station when a person arrived who had occasionally been spoken of as Mr Kimber.  He acted as tutor to our host's younger sons as he did also to another family in the neighbourhood.  He was a graduate of one of our leading universities, and had been found by Mr Strong in the humble capacity of hut-keeper on a neighbouring station, a situation he was compelled to take in consequence of having expended the whole of his means.  His present occupation was more in accordance with his tastes, although his salary was, I suspect, not very considerable.  He was evidently not cut out for an Australian settler, for though he could manage to stick on horseback, as Hector observed, \"he preferred a walk to a gallop;\" while he persisted in wearing a stove-pipe hat and a swallow-tail coat, which he evidently considered a more dignified costume than the straw hat and red shirt generally worn by all ranks in the bush.  He was amusing from the simplicity of his remarks, and as he was honest and well-informed, Mr Strong was really glad to retain him.  We had been expecting a visit from Bracewell, as Guy had written to him to tell him that we were still remaining with our relative, who did not appear to have any idea of leaving his station, but he had received no answer.  Mr Kimber gave two days of the week to the family of a Captain Mason, who owned the station next to Mr Strong's.  His plan was to ride over early in the morning of one day and to return late in the evening of the next.  After we had become tolerably intimate he invited me to accompany him, and to assist in teaching two of the younger boys.  As I wished to become acquainted with Captain Mason, and to see his station, I readily accepted his invitation.  I found a family very similar to that of Mr Strong, and quite as numerous; the girls and boys tall and lithe, but as active as crickets.  The girls told me to tell my cousins that they would ride over some day to see them, as soon as those abominable bushrangers had been captured.  We started somewhat later than usual from Captain Mason's, but the \"Dominie,\" as the boys called him, had frequently traversed the road, and assured me that he knew it perfectly.  We pushed on, however, as fast as we could go, wishing to get in before dark, as my companion confided to me the fact that he felt not a little nervous about the bushrangers, of whose atrocious deeds the young Masons had been telling him--the murders they had committed, the huts they had attacked, and the number of people they had stuck up.  I could not disprove the statements, though I believe the accounts greatly exaggerated, and I described to him the way we had driven the fellows off by the exhibition of firmness and courage.  \"All very well in daylight,\" he observed; \"but suppose the villains were to pop up from behind the bushes on the other side of the road, and order us to stand and deliver, and to threaten to shoot us if we attempted to draw our pistols,--and by the bye I haven't any to draw,-- what should we do?\"  \"Put spurs to our horses and gallop out of their way,\" I answered. \"They wouldn't dare to fire, and if they did, the chances are they would miss us.  We must run some danger in this country, and the risk is not nearly so great as riding after wild cattle as we have still to do, so pray do not make yourself unhappy on the subject.\"  Still, I saw that my companion looked anxiously about him, especially as it began to grow dusk, immediately after which darkness came on, and we were compelled to moderate our speed for fear of getting a knock on our heads from overhanging branches, or riding against fallen logs.  Eager as the dominie was to get on, not being a first-rate horseman he went even slower than was necessary.  We were passing through a thickish part of the forest, when, reining in his steed, he whispered to me in a tremulous voice--\"Pull up, pray do, I hear the tramp of horses' feet. Suppose they should be bushrangers, they might shoot us down before we had time to escape.\"  I reined in my steed to listen for the sounds which his sensitive ear had detected.  \"They may be simply wild cattle, or riderless horses, taking a scamper,\" I observed, laughing.  \"Oh, no; they don't move about after dark,\" he said; \"they must be mounted horses, do let us remain quiet until we ascertain who the people are.\"  \"They are very likely some of the young Strongs coming out to meet us,\" I remarked.  Scarcely had I said this, however, than I caught sight of two horsemen riding across an open glade some distance off.  There was sufficient light for me to make out the figures distinctly.  One was a big fellow in a rough garb, the other was slighter, and both were armed.  Presently afterwards two others came into view, the moonbeams glancing on the barrels of their rifles, showing that they also were armed.  I fully expected that they would discover us, and I intended if they did so boldly to ride up and enquire where they were going.  They galloped on, however, without perceiving us.  As I alone had arms I felt that it would be folly to interfere with them, as we might run the risk of being shot, while we could gain no possible advantage.  I therefore remained perfectly quiet, and in another minute they were out of sight.  They were going in the direction of Captain Mason's station.  They would be, however, mistaken, I hoped, if they expected to surprise our friends; who had assured me that they kept a watch by night and day, and were well prepared for such gentry.  As soon as they were out of hearing, we rode on; the dominie I saw feeling far from happy, as every now and then he turned his head over his shoulder to assure himself that we were not followed.  The moon, which had now risen high in the sky, afforded us ample light to see our way.  As the country became more open, we were able to push on as fast as we could go.  We were to have another adventure.  While still some distance from home, the loud lowing of a cow reached our ears.  The animal was evidently alarmed at something.  Galloping towards it, we found on getting up that she was endeavouring to protect her calf from the attack of a dozen dingoes.  Now she would run at one with her sharp horns, now at another, but the moment she had gone in one direction the brutes would assail her helpless young one.  They were not even deterred by our approach.  \"We must put an end to these dingoes!\"  I exclaimed.  Unstrapping one of my stirrup irons and using it as a weapon, I singled out one of the wild dogs, and succeeded, after several attempts, in giving it a blow on the head which brought it to the ground.  I then attacked another, which I treated in the same fashion.  The dominie tried to imitate me but very nearly tumbled over on his nose, though he assisted in protecting the calf by driving off the cowardly brutes.  The cow at last pinned one to the ground with her horns, and then turning round attacked it with her heels until she well-nigh pounded it into a jelly.  At length the survivors took to flight.  \"We have killed three at at all events,\" remarked the dominie.  \"Not so sure of that,\" I answered as we rode away, and turning my head, I observed that one of the dingoes was beginning to move.  I turned round, when it lay perfectly still, but it had crept on half a dozen yards at least.  I gave it a few more blows with my stirrup iron, and then getting out my knife cut its throat.  I treated its companions in the same manner, as I did not feel sure that the one the cow had tossed was really dead, so tenacious of life are the brutes.  I do not know whether the cow was grateful, but we left her licking her calf where the"]]]
