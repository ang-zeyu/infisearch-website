You and my father went to sea before you were as old as I am.  I don't like to be idle and a burden to you.  If you did not disapprove of it, I would go before the mast and work my way up--many have done so who are now masters in the merchant service; though, as you know, I would rather go into the navy, but from what you tell me that is out of the question. The owners of your old ship would, I dare say, take me as an apprentice; I'll try and do my duty, and learn to be a sailor so as to become an officer as soon as possible.\"  \"You look far ahead; but it is all right, my boy, and I am very sure of one thing, that you will do your duty and reap the reward, whatever happens.  I'll write to Clew, Earring and Grummet, and ask them if they have a vacancy for you.  Jack Clew, who was once in the navy, was a messmate of mine on board the old `Thunderer' when I lost my leg at `Navarin',\" (so the lieutenant always pronounced Navarino, the action fought by the British fleet under Sir Edward Codrington with that of the Turks and Egyptians).  \"Jack used to profess a willingness to serve me, but, Ned, we must not trust too much to old friends.  Times alter, and he may find he has applicants nearer at hand whose relatives have longer purses than I have.  Don't fear, however, my boy, something may turn up, as it always does, if we seek diligently to get it and wait with patience.\"  Ned did not then press the matter further; his spirits were buoyant, and although his uncle's remarks were not calculated to raise them, he was not disheartened.  Edward Garth, the lieutenant's nephew, was the son of a younger sister, who had married a friend and messmate, a lieutenant in the same noble service in which he had spent his best days.  They had served together in several ships up to the time that Garth was stricken down with fever up an African river, their ship then forming one of the blockading squadron on the west coast, when he committed his infant boy to his brother-in-law's care.  \"I am sure that you will look after him for our poor Fanny's sake; but she is delicate, and I know not what effect my death will have on her.  At all events, he will be fatherless, and she, poor girl, will find it a hard matter to manage a spirited lad.\"  \"Do not let that thought trouble you, Ned,\" answered Lieutenant Pack; \"Fanny's child shall ever be as if he were my own son.  I promised to keep house with Sally, and Fanny shall come and live with us.  A better soul than Sally does not exist, though I, who am her brother, say so.\"  Soon after he had seen his brother-in-law laid in the grave, Lieutenant Pack came home to find that his sister Fanny had followed her husband to the other world, and that Sally had already taken charge of their young nephew.  From that day forward she truly became a mother to the orphan, and as the lieutenant proved a kind, though not over indulgent father, Ned never felt the loss of his parents, and grew up all that his uncle and aunt could desire, rewarding them for their watchful care and judicious management of him.  The lieutenant's means would not allow him to bestow an expensive education on his nephew, but he was enabled to send him to a neighbouring grammar school, where the boy, diligently taking advantage of such instruction as it afforded, soon reached the head of each class in which he was placed.  Though first in all manly exercises, he made good use of his books at home, his uncle giving him lessons in mathematics and navigation, so that he was as well prepared for the profession he desired to enter as any boy of his age.  Ned was a favourite with all who knew him.  His home training had answered, for, though kind, it had been judicious.  He was truthful and honest, and sincerely, desirous of doing his duty, while he was manly and good-tempered, ever ready to forgive an injury, though well capable of standing up for himself.  Had the \"Worcester\" training-ship then been established, and had Ned gone on board her, he would probably have become a gold medallist, and that is saying much in his favour.  His uncle delighted in his society--\"Ned always made him feel young again,\" he used to say--and Aunt Sally bestowed upon him the affection of her kind and gentle heart.  As to Mary, she thought there never had been, never could be, a boy equal to brother Ned, for so she always called him, ever looking on him as her brother.  Ned faithfully returned the affectionate feelings evinced towards him by his relatives.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The one-legged lieutenant and his nephew continued their walk, the former stopping every now and then to impress a remark on Ned, or glancing over the ocean to observe the progress made by the outward-bound ship, until the row of whitewashed cottages, surmounted by a signal staff, which formed the coast-guard station of Longview, hove in sight.  Lieutenant Hanson, who met them at a short distance from it, shook Ned and his uncle cordially by the band.  \"We came to learn how poor Herron is getting on,\" said the lieutenant.  \"He'll weather it, I hope; but it was a wonder he was not killed from his fall down the cliff, sixty feet, with exposure to the rain and wind during the whole of the night, for we did not find him until the morning,\" answered the coast-guard officer.  \"The accident was even of more consequence to others than to himself, for had it not occurred, we might have been in time to save some more of the poor fellows from the wreck.\"  \"That may be so; but had you come, my black man Tom Baraka and Ned here would have lost the opportunity of showing what they are made of, by pulling one of them out of the water,\" said Lieutenant Pack.  \"What! had you a hand in saving the passenger?\" asked Lieutenant Hanson, turning to Ned.  \"Indeed he had, and had it not been for his courage I believe that the man would have been washed away again, for Tom was pretty well exhausted by that time,\" answered Lieutenant Pack.  \"You have begun well,\" said Mr Hanson, casting an approving look at Ned.  \"He has set his heart on going to sea, though I fear there is but little chance of his getting into the navy,\" observed Lieutenant Pack.  \"If he does, I hope that he may be more fortunate than some of his elders,\" answered the coast-guard lieutenant in a tone not very encouraging.  The remark produced a momentary effect on Ned, but he soon forgot it, and was as eager as before to become a sailor.  They proceeded on to the station, where, after visiting the injured man, for whom the old lieutenant had brought some delicacies made by Miss Sarah, he and his nephew set off to return home by a circuitous road, which ran a good way inland.  They had got some way, when they caught sight of Miss Sarah and Mary in the distance.  \"Go, Ned, and see where those women-kind of ours are bound for,\" exclaimed the lieutenant.  Ned ran forward.  \"We are going to visit Silas Shank the miser, as the people call him, though he must be very poor and miserable, as I cannot suppose that he would nearly starve himself if he had the means of buying proper food,\" answered Mary.  \"If I may, I will go with you,\" said Ned; \"perhaps Uncle Pack would like to come also.\"  The lieutenant, for whom they waited, however, preferred going home, and Miss Sally, giving her basket to Ned, returned with him, allowing her nephew to accompany Mary.  \"Just leave the pudding and jelly with the old man, and if he does not appear inclined to talk do not stop,\" said Miss Sally.  Ned and Mary walked on, cheerfully conversing, as they were wont to do, for they had always plenty to say to each other, and Mary's tongue wagged as fast as that of any young lady of her age, though not so thoughtlessly as that of many.  Ned naturally spoke of the ship he had seen running down channel.  \"I do not wish to be away from you all, but yet I did wish to be on board her, sailing to distant lands, to go among strange people, and to feel that I was doing something and learning to be an officer.  It would be a fine thing to command a ship like that.\"  \"I wish as you wish; but, O Ned, you would be a long, long time absent from us--months and months, or perhaps years and years.  Uncle Pack says that he was once five years without setting foot on English ground, and you might be as long away.  We shouldn't know you when you came back; you will be grown into a big man, with a bronzed face and bushy whiskers.\"  Mary laughed, though the tears at the same time came into her eyes.  \"But that was in the war-time, Mary, and even the Queen's ships are not now kept out for so long a period, while merchant vessels return every year, and sometimes from short voyages much oftener.  And then think of all the curiosities I should bring home; I should delight in collecting them for you and Aunt Sally, or to add to Uncle Pack's museum.\"  \"Yes, yes, it would be a very joyous time when you did come back, we should be delighted to see all the things you brought; but then think how slowly the days will pass by when you are away, uncle and aunt and I all alone.\"  \"There would be only one less,\" said Ned, naturally.  \"Yes, I know,\" answered Mary--she stopped short--she did not say how large a space Ned occupied in her world.  She was not aware of it herself just then.  The subject was one which made her feel sadder than was her wont, and she was glad to change it.  Old Shank's cottage was soon reached.  It stood about half a mile from the village.  It was situated in a hollow, an old quarry, by the side of a hill, the bare downs rising beyond it without a tree near.  A desolate-looking place in its best days.  Though containing several rooms--a large part of the roof having fallen in--it had only one which "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21472"],["title","Ned Garth; Or, Made Prisoner in Africa: A Tale of the Slave Trade (#6)"],["body","habitable.  In that lived Silas Shank the reputed miser.  The palings which fenced it in had been broken down to be used as firewood. The gate was off its hinges; nettles and other hardy weeds had taken possession of the garden.  Scarcely a pane of glass remained in any of the windows; even those of the rooms occupied by the miser were stuffed with rags, or had pieces of brown paper pasted over them.  \"I'll stay outside while you go in,\" said Ned; \"the old man was very surly when I last saw him, and I do not wish to face him again.  He can't be rough to you.\"  Mary knocked at the door, which was tightly closed.  \"Who's there?\" asked a tremulous voice.  \"It is I, Mary Pack; I've brought you something from aunt which she thought you would like to have.\"  The bars were withdrawn.  \"Come in!\" said the same voice, and the door was cautiously opened.  Mary, without hesitation, entered in time to see a thin old man, in a tattered threadbare great-coat, with a red woollen cap on his head, and slippered feet, his stockings hanging about his ankles, totter back to an arm-chair from which he had risen, by the side of a small wood fire on which a pot was boiling.  \"That's all I've got for my dinner, with a few potatoes, but it's enough to keep body and soul together, and what more does a wretched being like me want?\" he said in a querulous voice.  \"I have brought you something nice, as aunt knows you can't cook anything of the sort yourself, and you may eat it with more appetite than you can the potatoes,\" said Mary, placing the contents of the basket in some cracked plates on a rickety three-legged table which stood near the old man's chair.  He eagerly eyed the tempting-looking pudding, a nicely cooked chop, and a delicious jelly.  \"Yes, that's more like what I once used to have,\" he muttered.  \"Thank you, thank you, little girl.  I cannot buy such things for myself, but I am glad to get them from others.  Sit down, pray do, after your walk,\" and he pointed to a high-backed oak chair, of very doubtful stability and covered with dust.  He saw that Mary on that account hesitated to sit down, so rising he shambled forward and wiped it with an old cotton handkerchief which he drew out of his pocket. \"There, now it's all clean and nice; you must sit down and rest, and see me eat the food, so that you may tell your aunt I sold none of it.  The people say that I have parted with my coat off my back and the shoes from my feet, but do not believe them; if I did, it was on account of my poverty.\"  Mary made no reply; it appeared to her that the old man was contradicting himself, and she did not wish to inquire too minutely into the matter.  \"This pudding must have cost a great deal,\" he continued, as he ate it mouthful by mouthful; \"there's the flour, the milk, the raisins, and the sugar and spice, and other ingredients.  Your aunt must be a rich woman to afford so dainty a dish for a poor man like me?\"  \"No, I do not think Aunt Sally is at all rich, but she saves what little she can to give to the sick and needy; she heard that you were ill, Mr Shank, and had no one to care for you.\"  \"That's true, little girl, no one cares for the old miser, as they call me; and the boys, when I go into the village, throw stones at me, and jeer and shout at my heels.  I hate boys!\"  \"I'm sure Ned would not do that,\" said Mary; \"he is always kind and gentle, and would beat off bad boys if he saw them treating you in that way.\"  \"No, he wouldn't, he would join them, and behave like the rest.  They are all alike, boys!  Mischievous little imps!\"  Mary felt very indignant at hearing Ned thus designated, but she repressed her rising anger, pitying the forlorn old man, and smiling, said, \"You will find you are mistaken in regard to Ned, Mr Shank; he is outside, and I must not keep him waiting longer.  But I was nearly forgetting that I have a book to give you, which Aunt Sally thought you would like to read.  It is in large print, so that you need not try your eyes.\"  Mary, as she spoke, produced a thin book from her basket, and presented it to the old man.  He glanced at it with indifference.  \"I do not care about this sort of thing,\" he said.  \"I wonder people spend money in having such productions printed.  A loss of time to print them, and a loss of time to read them!\"  \"Aunt Sally will be much disappointed if you do not keep the book,\" said Mary, quietly; \"you might like to read it when you are all alone and have nothing else to do.\"  \"Well, well, as she has sent me the pudding, I'll keep the book; she means kindly, I dare say, and I do not wish to make you carry it back. What! must you go, little girl?  You'll come and see me again some day, and bring another nice pudding, won't you?\" said the old man, looking at Mary with a more amiable expression in his eyes than they generally wore.  \"Yes, I must go, I cannot, indeed, keep Ned waiting longer.  Good-bye, Mr Shank; you'll read the book, and I'll tell Aunt Sally what you say,\" said Mary, taking up her basket and tripping out of the room.  \"Don't let that boy Ned you spoke of throw stones in at my window.  You see how others have broken the panes, and it would cost too much money to have them repaired.\"  He said this as he followed Mary with a shuffling step to the door.  \"Ned would never dream of doing anything of the sort,\" she answered, now feeling greatly hurt at the remark.  \"They're all alike, they're all alike,\" muttered the old man; \"but you, I dare say, can keep him in order.  I didn't mean to offend you, little girl,\" he added, observing Mary's grave look, as she turned round to wish him good-bye before going through the doorway.  The remark pacified her.  \"Poor old man!\" she thought, \"sickness makes him testy.\"  \"Good-bye, little girl,\" said Mr Shank, as he stood with his hand on the door-latch; \"you'll come again soon?\"  \"If Aunt Sally sends me; but you must promise not to accuse Ned wrongfully.  Good-bye!\" answered Mary, as she stepped over the threshold, the old man immediately closing and bolting the door.  Ned, who had been on the watch at a little distance, sprang forward to meet her.  She did not tell him what old Mr Shank had said, as she naturally thought that it would make him indignant; and like a wise girl she confined herself merely to saying how glad he seemed to be to get the food, and how pool and wretched he looked.  Mary and Ned had a pleasant walk home.  After this she paid several visits to old Mr Shank, sometimes with Aunt Sally, at others with the lieutenant and Ned, but she always carried the basket and presented the contents to the old man.  Aunt Sally would not believe that he was really a miser, although the people called him one.  The cottage was his own, and he obtained periodically a few shillings at the bank, but this was all he was known to possess, and the amount was insufficient to supply him with the bare necessaries of life.  He picked up sticks and bits of coal which fell from carts for firing.  He possessed a few goats, which lived at free quarters on the downs, and their winter food cost but little.  He sold the kids and part of the milk which he did not consume.  He seemed grateful to Mary, and talked to her more than to any one else; but to Aunt Sally and the lieutenant he rarely uttered a word beyond a cold expression of thanks for the gifts they bestowed upon him.  Ned in the meantime was waiting anxiously for an answer to the letter his uncle had written Messrs. Clew, Earring and Grummet, the shipowners. After some delay a reply was received from a clerk, stating that Mr Clew was dead, and that the other partners were unable to comply with the lieutenant's request unless a considerable premium was paid, which was utterly beyond his means.  This was a great disappointment to Ned.  \"Don't fret over it, my boy,\" said his uncle, \"we shall all find many things to bear up against through life.  There's a good time coming for all of us, if we'll only wait patiently for it.  I ought to have been an admiral, and so I might if my leg hadn't been knocked away by a Turkish round shot at Navarin; but you see, notwithstanding, I am as happy as a prince.  As far as I myself am concerned I have no reasonable want unsupplied, though I should like to have your very natural wish complied with.\"  Still week after week went by; the lieutenant wrote several other letters, but the answers were unsatisfactory.  At last he began to talk of going up himself to town to call on the Admiralty, and to beard the lions in their den; but it was an undertaking the thoughts of which he dreaded far more than had he been ordered to head a boarding party against an enemy's ship.  He talked the matter over with his sister Sally.  \"If we want a thing we must go for it, if we don't want it we may stay at home and not get it,\" he observed.  \"If I felt anything like sure that I should succeed by pressing my claim, I'd go ten times as far; but my belief is, that I shall be sent back with a flea in my ear.\"  \"Still, what can poor Ned do if he doesn't go to sea, though I wish that we could have found him some employment on shore suited to his taste,\" said Miss Sarah.  \"Well, I'll make up my mind about the matter,\" said the lieutenant, who was as anxious as his sister to forward Ned's wishes.  \"I can but ask, you know, and if I am refused, I shall have good reason for grumbling for the next year to come, or to the end of my days.  I'll go and talk the subject over with Hanson; he knows more about the ways of the Admiralty than I do, and will give me a wrinkle or two.  In the meantime do you get my old uniform brushed up and my traps ready.\"  Next morning the old lieutenant, summoning Ned, set off to pay a visit to his brother officer.  Ned was in high spirits at hearing that steps were actually being taken to promote his object, and he expressed his gratitude to his uncle for the effort he was about to make on his behalf.  All difficulties seemed to vanish, and he already saw"]]]
