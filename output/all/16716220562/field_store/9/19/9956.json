To this the porter replied,       as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once before       heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels       of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means       of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back       were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a       little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their       uses, however evil—for, through the torture they caused the beast       by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree       of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and       so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.        “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without       once even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the       hills, while the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an       opposite direction, so that, by these means, he finally made his       escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took       excellent care—although this is a point I cannot determine, as I       do not remember that I ever beheld him again.        “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin       (who had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon       overtaken, bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which       immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.        “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home       to peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being       useless, I made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to       secure the goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and       who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded       so well in this endeavor that, in a few days, the creature       bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in the end even       went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was       vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was       enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it       comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.        “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt       grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after       dinner—but I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your       majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so       the man-animals were called; I presume because their language       formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of       the rooster). With your permission, I will translate. ‘Washish       squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am happy to find, my       dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are       now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the       globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will       strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the       beast.’”        When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the       “Isitsöornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his       right, and said:        “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you       omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know       I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?”        The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair       Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:        “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I thanked the       man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at       home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the       ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the       world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we       went—so to say—either up hill or down hill all the time.’        “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.        “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.        “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as       to go on with the story.”        “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the       caliph, ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at       length, we arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in       circumference, but which, nevertheless, had been built in the       middle of the sea by a colony of little things like       caterpillars.’” (*1)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Scheherazade, it must be       understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered       ejaculation) ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the       forests were of solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to       pieces the finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut       them down.’” (*2)        “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no       attention, continued in the language of Sinbad.        “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where       there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty       miles within the bowels of the earth, and that contained a       greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces       than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs       of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like diamonds, but       larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids       and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and       swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty       mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted       metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long       (*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a       quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the       heavens, and it became darker than the darkest midnight; so that       when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles       from the mountain, it was impossible to see the whitest object,       however close we held it to our eyes.’” (*5)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until       we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed       reversed—for we here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which,       more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water, there       flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.’”       (*6)        “Hoo!” said the king.        “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the       atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our       own does feather.’” (*7)        “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.        “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at       the most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there       meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This       river was of unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than       that of amber. It was from three to six miles in width; and its       banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in       perpendicular height, were crowned with ever-blossoming trees and       perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the whole territory       one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land was the       Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.’” (*8)        “Humph!” said the king.        “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came       to another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of       monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.       These hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil,       of a funnel shape, and line the sides of them with rocks, so       disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly, when       trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them into the       monster’s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and       their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an       immense distance from “the caverns of death.\"’” (*9)        “Pooh!” said the king.        “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with       vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10)       There were others that sprang from the substance of other       vegetables; (*11) others that derived their substance from the       bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there were others       that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that moved       from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more       wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and       moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable       passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining       them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of       appointed tasks.’” (*15)        “Pshaw!” said the king.        “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the       bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and       erudition, that they give daily instructions in the science of       geometry to the wise men of the empire. The king of the place       having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult       problems, they were solved upon the spot—the one by the bees,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 (#7)"],["body","       the other by the birds; but the king keeping their solution a       secret, it was only after the most profound researches and labor,       and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series       of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the       identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the       bees and by the birds.’” (*16)        “Oh my!” said the king.        “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found       ourselves close upon another, from whose shores there flew over       our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and       forty miles long; so that, although they flew a mile during every       minute, it required no less than four hours for the whole flock       to pass over us—in which there were several millions of millions       of fowl.’” (*17)        “Oh fy!” said the king.        “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us       great annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a       fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs       which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the       biggest of the domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of       Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive,       but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious       fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,       shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the       monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house       from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of       which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in       a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited       them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening       the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort       or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy       sack which proved to be filled with sand!’”        “Stuff!” said the king.        “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a       continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which,       nevertheless, was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue       cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.’” (*18)        “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read       something of the kind before, in a book.”        “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in       between the legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found       ourselves in a wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by       the man-animal, was his own native land, inhabited by things of       his own species. This elevated the man-animal very much in my       esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel ashamed of the       contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for I       found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most       powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19)       which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful       writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of       imagination!’”        “Nonsense!” said the king.        “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very       singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones       were iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he       had black stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard       a diet, he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more       weighty than the grandest temple in this city, at a rate       surpassing that of the flight of most birds.’” (*20)        “Twattle!” said the king.        “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but       bigger than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and       brick; her blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she       was nearly related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate       nothing but wood or black stones. This hen brought forth very       frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they       took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of       their mother.’” (*21)        “Fal lal!” said the king.        “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of       brass and wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity       that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with       the exception of the great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22)       Another of these magi constructed (of like material) a creature       that put to shame even the genius of him who made it; for so       great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed       calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required       the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)       But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a       mighty thing that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains       of lead, intermixed with a black matter like pitch, and fingers       that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it       would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies       of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a precision,       that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from       another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of       prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the       mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised       equally for evil and for good.’”        “Ridiculous!” said the king.        “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in       his veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of       sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his       dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had       the faculty of converting the common metals into gold, without       even looking at them during the process. (*25) Another had such a       delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.       (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he counted       all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was       springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred       millions of times in a second.’” (*27)        “Absurd!” said the king.        “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody       ever yet saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish       their arms, kick out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance       at his will. (*28) Another had cultivated his voice to so great       an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of       the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an arm that he       could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad—or       indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the       lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at       his call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another       took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another       constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31)       Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the       sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33) Another took       this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first       weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths       and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were       made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a       necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their       commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects       that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of years       before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from       the face of creation.’” (*34)        “Preposterous!” said the king.        “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise       magi,’” continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner       disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions       on the part of her husband—“‘the wives and daughters of these       eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and       refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and       beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from       which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and       fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities       come in certain shapes, and some in others—but this of which I       speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.’”        “A what?” said the king.        “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who       are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into       the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we       describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the       protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the       small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they say, is in the       direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long       possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country,       the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a       woman from a dromedary—’”        “Stop!” said the king—“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have       already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day,       too, I perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been       married?—my conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And       then that dromedary touch—do you take me for a fool? Upon the       whole, you might as well get up and be throttled.”        These words, as I learn from the “Isitsöornot,” both grieved and       astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king "]]]
