These emissaries--botanical collectors, or \"plant-hunters,\" as they may be called--in the pursuit of their calling, have explored, and are still engaged in exploring, the wildest and most remote countries of the globe--such as the deep, dark forests upon the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the Oregon in America; the hot equatorial regions of Africa; the tropical jungles of India; the rich woods of the Oriental islands; and, in short, wherever there is a prospect of discovering and obtaining new floral or sylvan beauties.  The exploration of the Sikhim Himalaya by the accomplished botanist, Hooker--recorded in a book of travels not inferior to that of the great Humboldt--had drawn attention to the rich and varied _flora_ of these mountains; and in consequence of this, the enterprising \"seedsman\" who had given Karl Linden temporary employment in his garden, promoted him to a higher and more agreeable field of labour, by sending him as a \"plant-hunter\" to the Thibetan Himalayas.  Accompanied by his brother, Caspar, the young botanist proceeded to Calcutta; and, after a short residence there, he set out for the Himalayas--taking a direction almost due north from the city of the Ganges.  He had provided himself with a guide, in the person of a celebrated Hindoo hunter or \"shikaree,\" called Ossaroo; and this individual was the sole attendant and companion of the two brothers--with the exception of a large dog, of the boar-hound species, which had been brought with them from Europe, and that answered to the name of Fritz.  The young botanist had come to India furnished with a letter of introduction to the manager of the Botanical Garden of Calcutta--an establishment of world-wide renown.  There he had been hospitably received on his arrival in the Oriental city; and during his sojourn he had spent much of his time within its boundaries.  Moreover, the authorities of the place, interested in his expedition, had given him all the information in their power as to the route he intended pursuing--though that was not much: for the portion of the Himalayas he was about to explore was at that time a _terra incognita_ to Englishmen--even in the city of Calcutta!  It is not necessary here to detail the many adventures that befel our plant-hunter and his party, during the progress of their journey towards the Himalayas, and after they had entered within the grand gorges of these mountains.  Suffice it to say, that in pursuit of a beautiful little animal--a \"musk-deer\"--they had gone up a gully filled by one of those grand glaciers so common in the higher Himalayas; that the pursuit had led them far up the ravine, and afterwards conducted them into a singular crater-like valley--the one already described; that once in this valley, they could find no way out of it, but by the ravine through which they had entered; and that on returning to make their exit, they discovered to their great consternation that a crevasse in the glacier, over which they had passed, had opened during their absence, and to such an extent as to render their exit impossible!  They had endeavoured to span this crevasse; and had spent much time in making a bridge of pine-trees for the purpose.  They had succeeded at length in getting across the chasm--but only to find others in the glacier below, which no ingenuity could enable them to get over.  They were compelled to abandon the idea, and return again to the valley; which, though lovely to the eye, had now become hateful to their thoughts: since they knew it to be their _prison_.  During their residence in the place, many adventures befel them with wild animals of various kinds.  There chanced to be a small herd of \"yaks,\" or grunting oxen, in the valley; and these formed for a time the staple article of their food.  Caspar, who, though younger than Karl, was the more skilled hunter of the two, had a very narrow escape from the old yak bull; though he succeeded at length in killing the dangerous animal.  Ossaroo was very near being eaten up by a pack of wild dogs-- every one of which he afterwards succeeded in killing; and Ossaroo was also in danger of being swallowed up by an enemy of a very different kind--that is by a _quicksand_, into which he had got his legs while engaged in taking fish out of a net!  Karl was not without _his_ hair-breadth \"'scape\"--having been chased by a bear along a ledge of the cliff, from which he was compelled to make a most perilous descent.  The bear itself took refuge in a cave, where it was afterwards pursued and killed, by all three acting in concert, materially assisted by the dog Fritz.  They had incurred great risk in this chase of the bear: for although they had succeeded in destroying the formidable animal they lost themselves in the great labyrinthine cavern, and were only able to find their way out by making a fire with the stocks of their guns, and rendering the bear's-grease available for candles--which fortunately enabled them to extricate themselves.  During the pursuit of the bear, and their subsequent endeavours to find their way out, our adventurers had been struck by the enormous dimensions of the cavern in which the animal had taken refuge; and in the hope that some of its great galleries might lead out through the mountain, and offer them a way of escape from the valley, they had made torches, and explored it from end to end.  It was all to no purpose; and becoming satisfied that there was no exit by way of the cavern, they had at length desisted from the search.  From this point shall we continue, in more circumstantial detail, the history of their attempts to escape from their mountain prison; which they were now convinced could only be done by _climbing the cliff_ that encircled it.  The Cliff Climbers--by Captain Mayne Reid    CHAPTER FOUR.  HOME TO THE HUT.  Emerging from the cave after their fruitless exploration, all three-- Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo--sat down upon the rocks in front of the cliff, and for some time remained silent.  The looks of all betokened a deep and hopeless despair.  The same thought was passing in their minds. A painful thought it was--that they were completely cut off from all communication with the world, and might never again look on human faces, save their own!  Caspar was the first to give expression to this gloomy foreboding.  \"Oh, brother!\" groaned he, addressing himself to Karl, who sat nearest to him, \"oh! it is an awful fate!  Here must we live, here must we die, far away from home, far away from the world--alone--alone!\"  \"No,\" replied Karl, deeply moved by the distress of his brother, \"no, Caspar, not alone--God is with us.  Let Him be our world.\"  However Caspar in his conscience might have acknowledged the justice of the admonition, it failed to cheer him.  Indeed, he could not help perceiving, that Karl had uttered the speech half doubtingly, and with the design of affording consolation.  Moreover, the effort which Karl was making to look hopeful and cheerful was evidently constrained; and only the more convinced his companions that neither hope nor joy was in his breast.  To Karl's consolatory words his brother made no rejoinder.  Ossaroo, however, gave vent to his thoughts by an ambiguous shake of the head, and a brief speech characteristic of that belief in fatalism peculiar to his race.  \"Ah, sahibs,\" said he, addressing himself to both, \"if the Great Sahib in the sky will we go out from here, we go--if He no will, we no go-- nivvamore.\"  Ossaroo's speech, however compatible with a true faith, did not contribute much towards cheering the spirits of the party; and for another long interval all remained silent.  Caspar and Ossaroo appeared completely prostrated by the new disappointment.  Karl, on the other hand, seemed less disposed to view things despairingly; and as he sate, was evidently engaged in active thought.  After awhile his companions observed this; though neither made any attempt to rouse him from his reverie.  They guessed, that, whatever was passing in his mind would soon be communicated to them.  They were right in this conjecture: for in a few minutes Karl terminated the silence by addressing them.  \"Come!\" said he, speaking in a tone of encouragement, \"we are wrong in so soon yielding to despair.  Let us not give up, till we are beaten at all points.  I have told you what my object was, when I first mounted upon that ledge, and discovered the cave and its surly occupant, the bear.  I thought then, that, if we could find a series of ledges one above another, and sufficiently near each other, we might plant ladders upon them, and so reach the top.  You see that there is such a succession of ledges--just before your faces there.  Unfortunately there is one of the spaces high up yonder--where the cliff is darkest--that cannot be less than sixty or seventy feet in width.  I have ascertained that by comparing it with the height from the ground to the cave--which I had just finished measuring when I met the bear.  It would be impossible for us to make a ladder that length--or even to hoist it up there if made--so that all thought of scaling the cliff at this point must be given up.\"  \"Perhaps,\" interposed Caspar, catching at Karl's idea, \"there may be some other part of the precipice where the ledges are nearer to each other?  Did you examine it all around?\"  \"No.  I had got no further than this place, when I met Master Bruin; and, as you know, our adventures with him and our exploration of the cave have taken up our time ever since, and, indeed, driven the design of the ladders quite out of my head.  Now, however, we may return to it; and our next move will be to go all round, and see whether a better place may not be discovered.  To-night it is too late.  It already begins to darken; and we must"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21239"],["title","The Cliff Climbers (#3)"],["body","clear daylight for such a purpose. Let us home to our hut, and have some supper and then go to rest--having first prayed to Him for success.  We may rise in better spirits, and continue our examination in the morning.\"  To this proposal there was no objection on the part of either Caspar or Ossaroo.  On the contrary, the mention of supper--both being very hungry--had caused them to start to their feet with remarkable alacrity; and Karl, taking the lead, they followed him, Fritz in turn following them.  On arriving at their hut, supper was cooked and eaten, with that zest which hunger always gives, even to the coarsest viands; and, having carried out the remaining part of the programme which Karl had suggested--that is, the offering up a prayer for success on the morrow-- the trio sought their grass-covered couches with a feeling of renewed hopefulness.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A MIDNIGHT INTRUDER.  They had been asleep several hours, when all three were suddenly awakened by the barking of Fritz.  During night hours the faithful creature stayed habitually within the hut--where he also had his bed of dry grass.  On hearing any unusual noise without, he would rush forth and prowl about for awhile; and, after satisfying himself that there was no enemy in the neighbourhood, would return quietly to his lair.  Fritz was far from being a noisy dog.  He had seen too much service, and gathered too much wisdom, to waste his breath in idle barking; and it was only upon grand and important occasions that he condescended to give tongue.  Then, however, his bark--or bay, it should rather be termed-- was terrific.  On the occasion in question--which happened just about the hour of midnight--the three sleepers were suddenly awakened by his expansive \"yowl,\" that filled the whole valley, and reverberating from the cliffs, appeared continuous.  The dog, after uttering this warning note, had rushed out of the hut--which had no door to it--and it was from some place down near the lake that his barking appeared to proceed.  \"What can it be?\" was the prompt and _very_ natural inquiry of the three individuals, whom Fritz had so abruptly awakened from their slumbers.  \"Something Fritz is frightened at,\" said Caspar, who knew the dog's nature better than either of the others.  \"He don't bark that way at any sort of game that he knows he can conquer.  It's some animal that's a match for him, I warrant.  If the old yak bull were still alive, I should say it was he.\"  \"There may be tigers in this valley; I never thought of that,\" rejoined Karl.  \"Now that I do think of it,\" continued he, drawing upon the reminiscences of his zoological reading, \"it is quite probable.  People believe the tiger to be exclusively an inhabitant of tropical or subtropical regions.  That is an error.  On this continent (the speaker was in Asia) the royal Bengal tiger ranges at least as far north as the latitude of London.  I know he is found on the Amoor as high as the fiftieth degree.\"  \"Mercy on us!\" broke in Caspar; \"it may be a tiger, and we have never thought of having a door to our hut!  If it should be one--\"  Here the hypothetic speech of Caspar was abruptly brought to a conclusion, by a singular noise from without--which was heard mingling in chorus with the baying of Fritz.  The noise in question bore some resemblance to the sound of a trumpet, only sharper and more treble in its character.  It was in effect more like the squeak of a _penny trumpet_ than the real article; and yet, withal, there was something terrifying in the sound.  It must have terrified Fritz: for the moment after it was heard, the dog came rushing back into the hut, as if pursued by a legion of horned bulls; and, though he kept up his angry baying, he appeared altogether disinclined to venture out again.  Just then, the singular noise was heard outside the door--something between a shriek and a whistle--and this time with a far more terrifying effect: since, whatever produced it--bird, beast, or man--was evidently near, and still approaching nearer.  Of the three individuals within the hut, only one had ever before heard a sound exactly similar to that.  Ossaroo was the one.  The old shikaree recognised the noise the moment it reached his ears, and knew perfectly well the sort of instrument that must have been producing it; but he was hindered for a time from proclaiming his knowledge, by surprise, as well as a strong feeling of terror at hearing such a sound in such a place.  \"By de wheels ob Juggernaut car!\" he gasped out.  \"Can't be--can't be; no possible him be here.\"  \"Who?  What?\" demanded Karl and Caspar, in a breath.  \"See, sahibs! it him--it him!\" hurriedly rejoined the Hindoo, in a sort of shrieking whisper.  \"We all perish--it him--it him--de god--de mighty--de terrible--\"  There was no light within the hovel, except a faint glimmer from the moon shining brightly enough outside; but it did not require any light to tell that the shikaree was frightened pretty nearly out of his senses.  His companions could discover by his voice that he had suddenly changed position, and was retreating backward to that corner of the hut furthest from the doorway.  At the same time his words reached them in whispers, cautioning them to lie close and keep silent.  Both, without knowing what the danger was, of course obeyed injunctions thus emphatically delivered; and remained sitting up on their couches without uttering a word.  Ossaroo, after having delivered his cautioning speeches, kept equally silent.  Once more the strange sound fell upon their ears--this time as if the instrument that produced it had been thrust into the doorway of the hovel.  At the same instant the turf outside, hitherto glistening under a bright moonlight, became darkened by the shadow of an enormous creature--as if the queen of night had suddenly disappeared behind the blackest of clouds!  Still the light could be seen beyond, and the moon was shining.  It was no cloud that had obscured her; but some vast body moving over the earth, and which, having come up to the front of the hovel, was there halting.  Karl and Caspar fancied they could see a gigantic living form, with huge thick limbs, standing outside; but, indeed, both were as much terrified by the apparition as Ossaroo himself, though perhaps for a different reason.  Fritz must have been as much frightened as any of the four; and fear had produced upon him an effect exactly similar to that it had produced upon Ossaroo.  It kept him silent.  Cowering in a corner, Fritz was now as quiet as if he had been born a voiceless _dingo_.  This speechless trance seemed to have its influence upon the awe-inspiring shadow outside the door: for, after giving utterance to another specimen of shrill piping, it withdrew with as much silence as if it had been but the shadow it appeared!  Caspar's curiosity had become too strong to be kept any longer under the control of his fears.  As soon as the strange intruder was seen moving away from the hut, he stole forward to the entrance, and looked out. Karl was not slow in following him; and Ossaroo also ventured from his hiding-place.  A dark mass--in form like a quadruped, but one of gigantic size--could be seen going off in the direction of the lake.  It moved in majestic silence; but it could have been no shadow, for on crossing the stream-- near the point where the latter debouched into the lake--the plashing of its feet could be heard as it waded through the water, and eddies could be seen upon the calm surface.  A simple shadow would not have made such a commotion as that?  \"Sahibs!\" said Ossaroo, in a tone of mysterious gravity, \"he be one ob two ting.  He eider be de god Brahma, or--\"  \"Or what?\" demanded Caspar.  \"An ole rogue.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  A TALK ABOUT ELEPHANTS.  \"An old rogue?\" said Caspar, repeating the words of the shikaree.  \"What do you mean by that, Ossy?\"  \"What you Feringhee, sahib, call _rogue_ elephant.\"  \"Oh! an elephant!\" echoed Karl and Caspar--both considerably relieved at this natural explanation of what had appeared so like a supernatural apparition.  \"Certainly the thing looked like one,\" continued Caspar.  \"But how could an elephant enter this valley?\"  Ossaroo could not answer this question.  He was himself equally puzzled by the appearance of the huge quadruped; and still rather inclined to the belief that it was some of his trinity of Brahminee gods, that had for the nonce assumed the elephantine form.  For that reason he made no attempt to explain the presence of such an animal in the valley.  \"It is possible for one to have come up here from the lower country,\" remarked Karl, reflectively.  \"But how could he get into the valley?\" again inquired Caspar.  \"In the same way as we got in ourselves,\" was Karl's reply; \"up the glacier and through the gorge.\"  \"But the crevasse that hinders us from getting out?  You forget that, brother?  An elephant could no more cross it than he could fly; surely not?\"  \"Surely not,\" rejoined Karl.  \"I did not say that he could have crossed the crevasse.\"  \"Oh! you mean that he may have come up here before we did?\"  \"Exactly so.  If it be an elephant we have seen--and what else can it be?\" pursued Karl, no longer yielding to a belief in the supernatural character of their nocturnal visitant--\"it must of course have got into the valley before us.  The wonder is our having seen no signs of such an animal before.  You, Caspar, have been about more than any of us.  Did you never, in your rambles, observe anything like an elephant's track?\"  \"Never.  It never occurred to me to look for such a thing.  Who would have thought of a great elephant having climbed up here?  One would fancy such unwieldy creatures quite incapable of ascending a mountain.\"  \"Ah! there you would be in error: for, singular as it may appear, the elephant is a wonderful climber, and can make his way almost anywhere that a man can go.  It is a fact, that in the island of Ceylon the wild elephants are"]]]
