Supposing that the octohedrons of galena, of gold, and of oxide of iron, were endowed with powers of reproduction, and perished at appointed dates of dissolution or solution, you would without any doubt have heard it by this time asserted that the octohedric form, which was common to all, indicated their descent from a common progenitor; and it would have been ingeniously explained to you how the angular offspring of this eight-sided ancestor had developed themselves, by force of circumstances, into their distinct metallic perfections; how the galena had become gray and brittle under prolonged subterranean heat, and the gold yellow and ductile, as it was rolled among the pebbles of amber-colored streams.  60. By the denial to these structures of any individually reproductive energy, you are forced to accept the inexplicable (and why expect it to be otherwise than inexplicable?) fact, of the formation of a series of bodies having very similar aspects, qualities, and chemical relations to other substances, which yet have no connection whatever with each other, and are governed, in their relation with their native rocks, by entirely arbitrary laws. It has been the pride of modern chemistry to extricate herself from the vanity of the alchemist, and to admit, with resignation, the independent, though apparently fraternal, natures, of silver, of lead, of platinum,--aluminium,--potassium. Hence, a rational philosophy would deduce the probability that when the arborescence of dead crystallization rose into the radiation of the living tree, and sentient plume, the splendor of nature in her more exalted power would not be restricted to a less variety of design; and the beautiful caprice in which she gave to the silver its frost and to the opal its fire, would not be subdued under the slow influences of accident and time, when she wreathed the swan with snow, and bathed the dove in iridescence. That the infinitely more exalted powers of life must exercise more intimate influence over matter than the reckless forces of cohesion;--and that the loves and hatreds of the now conscious creatures would modify their forms into parallel beauty and degradation, we might have anticipated by reason, and we ought long since to have known by observation. But this law of its spirit over the substance of the creature involves, necessarily, the indistinctness of its type, and the existence of inferior and of higher conditions, which whole eras of heroism and affection--whole eras of misery and misconduct,--confirm into glory, or confuse into shame. Collecting the causes of changed form, in lower creatures, by distress, or by adaptation,--by the disturbance or intensifying of the parental strength, and the native fortune--the wonder is, not that species should sometimes be confused, but that the greater number of them remain so splendidly, so manifestly, so eternally distinct; and that the vile industries and vicious curiosities of modern science, while they have robbed the fields of England of a thousand living creatures, have not created in them one.  61. But even in the paltry knowledge we have obtained, what unanimity have we?--what security? Suppose any man of ordinary sense, knowing the value of time, and the relative importance of subjects of thought, and that the whole scientific world was agog concerning the origin of species, desired to know first of all--what was meant by a species.  He would naturally look for the definition of species first among the higher animals, and expect it to be best defined in those which were best known. And being referred for satisfaction to the 226th page of the first volume of Mr. Darwin's \"Descent of Man,\" he would find this passage:--  \"Man has been studied more carefully than any other organic being, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity among capable judges, whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach), six (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawford), or as sixty-three according to Burke.\"  And in the meantime, while your men of science are thus vacillating, in the definition of the species of the only animal they have the opportunity of studying inside and out, between one and sixty-three; and disputing about the origin, in past ages, of what they cannot define in the present ones; and deciphering the filthy heraldries which record the relation of humanity to the ascidian and the crocodile, you have ceased utterly to distinguish between the two species of man, evermore separate by infinite separation: of whom the one, capable of loyalty and of love, can at least conceive spiritual natures which have no taint from their own, and leave behind them, diffused among thousands on earth, the happiness they never hoped, for themselves, in the skies; and the other, capable only of avarice, hatred, and shame, who in their lives are the companions of the swine, and leave in death nothing but food for the worm and the vulture.  62. Now I have first traced for you the relations of the creature we are examining to those beneath it and above, to the bat and to the falcon. But you will find that it has still others to entirely another world. As you watch it glance and skim over the surface of the waters, has it never struck you what relation it bears to the creatures that glance and glide _under_ their surface? Fly-catchers, some of them, also,--fly-catchers in the same manner, with wide mouth; while in motion the bird almost exactly combines the dart of the trout with the dash of the dolphin, to the rounded forehead and projecting muzzle of which its own bullet head and bill exactly correspond. In its plunge, if you watch it bathing, you may see it dip its breast just as much under the water as a porpoise shows its back above. You can only rightly describe the bird by the resemblances, and images of what it seems to have changed from,--then adding the fantastic and beautiful contrast of the unimaginable change. It is an owl that has been trained by the Graces. It is a bat that loves the morning light. It is the aërial reflection of a dolphin. It is the tender domestication of a trout.  63. And yet be assured, as it cannot have been all these creatures, so it has never, in truth, been any of them. The transformations believed in by the mythologists are at least spiritually true; you cannot too carefully trace or too accurately consider them. But the transformations believed in by the anatomist are as yet proved true in no single instance, and in no substance, spiritual or material; and I cannot too often, or too earnestly, urge you not to waste your time in guessing what animals may once have been, while you remain in nearly total ignorance of what they are.  64. Do you even know distinctly from each other,--(for that is the real naturalist's business; instead of confounding them with each other),--do you know distinctly the five great species of this familiar bird?--the swallow, the house-martin, the sand-martin, the swift, and the Alpine swift?--or can you so much as answer the first question which would suggest itself to any careful observer of the form of its most familiar species,--yet which I do not find proposed, far less answered, in any scientific book,--namely, why a swallow has a swallow-tail?  It is true that the tail feathers in many birds appear to be entirely,--even cumbrously, decorative; as in the peacock, and birds of paradise. But I am confident that it is not so in the swallow, and that the forked tail, so defined in form and strong in plume, has indeed important functions in guiding the flight; yet notice how surrounded one is on all sides with pitfalls for the theorists. The forked tail reminds you at once of a fish's; and yet, the action of the two creatures is wholly contrary. A fish lashes himself forward with his tail, and steers with his fins; a swallow lashes himself forward with his fins, and steers with his tail; partly, not necessarily, because in the most dashing of the swallows, the swift, the fork of the tail is the least developed. And I never watch the bird for a moment without finding myself in some fresh puzzle out of which there is no clue in the scientific books. I want to know, for instance, how the bird turns. What does it do with one wing, what with the other? Fancy the pace that has to be stopped; the force of bridle-hand put out in an instant. Fancy how the wings must bend with the strain; what need there must be for the perfect aid and work of every feather in them. There is a problem for you, students of mechanics,--How does a swallow turn?  You shall see, at all events, to begin with, to-day, how it gets along.  65. I say you shall see; but indeed you have often seen, and felt,--at least with your hands, if not with your shoulders,--when you chanced to be holding the sheet of a sail.  I have said that I never got into scrapes by blaming people wrongly; but I often do by praising them wrongly. I never praised, without qualification, but one scientific book in my life (that I remember)--this of Dr. Pettigrew's on the Wing;[12] and now I must qualify my praise considerably, discovering, when I examined the book farther, that the good doctor had described the motion of a bird as resembling that of a kite, without ever inquiring what, in a bird, represented that somewhat important part of a kite, the string. You will, however, find the book full of important observations, and illustrated by valuable drawings. But the point in question you must settle for yourselves, and you easily may. Some of you perhaps, knew, in your time, better than the doctor, how a kite stopped; but I do not doubt that a great "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],["title","Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#8)"],["body","of you also know, now, what is much more to the purpose, how a ship gets along. I will take the simplest, the most natural, the most beautiful of sails,--the lateen sail of the Mediterranean.        [12] \"On the Physiology of Wings.\" Transactions of the Royal       Society of Edinburgh. Vol. xxvi., Part ii. I cannot sufficiently       express either my wonder or regret at the petulance in which men       of science are continually tempted into immature publicity, by       their rivalship with each other. Page after page of this book,       which, slowly digested and taken counsel upon, might have been a       noble contribution to natural history, is occupied with dispute       utterly useless to the reader, on the question of the priority of       the author, by some months, to a French savant, in the statement       of a principle which neither has yet proved; while page after       page is rendered worse than useless to the reader by the author's       passionate endeavor to contradict the ideas of unquestionably       previous investigators. The problem of flight was, to all serious       purpose, solved by Borelli in 1680, and the following passage is       very notable as an example of the way in which the endeavor to       obscure the light of former ages too fatally dims and distorts       that by which modern men of science walk, themselves. \"Borelli,       and all who have written since his time, are unanimous in       affirming that the horizontal transference of the body of the       bird is due to the perpendicular vibration of the wings, and to       the yielding of the posterior or flexible margins of the wings in       an upward direction, as the wings descend. I\" (Dr. Pettigrew)       \"am, however, disposed to attribute it to the fact (1st), that       _the wings_, both when elevated and depressed, _leap forwards_ in       curves, those curves uniting to form a continuous waved track;       (2d), _to the tendency which the body of the bird has to swing       forwards_, in a more or less horizontal direction, _when once set       in motion_; (3d), to the construction of the wings; they are       elastic helices or screws, which twist and untwist while they       vibrate, _and tend to bear upwards and onwards any weight       suspended from them_; (4th), _to the action of the air on the       under surfaces_ of the wings; (5th), _to the ever-varying power       with which the wings are urged_, this being greatest at the       beginning of the down-stroke, and least at the end of the up one;       (6th), _to the contraction of the voluntary muscles_ and elastic       ligaments, and to the effect produced by the various inclined       surfaces formed by the wings during their oscillations; (7th),       _to the weight of the bird_--weight itself, when acting upon       wings, becoming a propelling power, and so contributing to       horizontal motion.\"        I will collect these seven reasons for the forward motion, in the       gist of them, which I have marked by italics, that the reader may       better judge of their collective value. The bird is carried       forward, according to Dr. Pettigrew--        1. Because its wings leap forward.        2. Because its body has a tendency to swing forward.        3. Because its wings are screws so constructed as to screw       upwards and onwards any body suspended from them.        4. Because the air reacts on the under surfaces of the wings.        5. Because the wings are urged with ever-varying power.        6. Because the voluntary muscles contract.        7. Because the bird is heavy.        What must be the general conditions of modern science, when it is       possible for a man of great experimental knowledge and practical       ingenuity, to publish nonsense such as this, becoming, to all       intents and purposes, insane, in the passion of his endeavor to       overthrow the statements of his rival? Had he merely taken       patience to consult any elementary scholar in dynamics, he would       have been enabled to understand his own machines, and develop,       with credit to himself, what had been rightly judged or noticed       by others.  66. I draw it rudely in outline, as it would be set for a side-wind on the boat you probably know best,--the boat of burden on the Lake of Geneva (Fig. 3), not confusing the drawing by adding the mast, which, you know, rakes a little, carrying the yard across it (_a_). Then, with your permission, I will load my boat thus, with a few casks of Vevay vintage--and, to keep them cool, we will put an awning over them, so (_b_). Next, as we are classical scholars, instead of this rustic stern of the boat, meant only to run easily on a flat shore, we will give it an Attic [Greek: embolon] (_c_). (We have no business, indeed, yet, to put an [Greek: embolon] on a boat of burden, but I hope some day to see all our ships of war loaded with bread and wine, instead of artillery.) Then I shade the entire form (_c_); and, lastly, reflect it in the water (_d_)--and you have seen something like that before, besides a boat, haven't you?  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  There is the gist of the whole business for you, put in very small space; with these only differences: in a boat, the air strikes the sail; in a bird, the sail strikes the air: in a boat, the force is lateral, and in a bird downwards; and it has its sail on both sides. I shall leave you to follow out the mechanical problem for yourselves, as far as the mere resolution of force is concerned. My business, as a painter, is only with the exquisite organic weapon that deals with it.  67. Of which you are now to note farther, that a bird is required to manage his wing so as to obtain two results with one blow:--he has to keep himself up, as well as to get along.  But observe, he only requires to keep himself up _because_ he has to get along. The buoyancy might have been given at once, if nature had wanted _that_ only; she might have blown the feathers up with the hot air of the breath, till the bird rose in air like a cork in water. But it has to be, not a buoyant cork, but a buoyant _bullet_. And therefore that it may have momentum for pace, it must have weight to carry; and to carry that weight, the wings must deliver their blow with effective vertical, as well as oblique, force.  Here, again, you may take the matter in brief sum. Whatever is the ship's loss, is the bird's gain; whatever tendency the ship has to leeway, is all given to the bird's support, so that every atom[13] of force in the blow is of service.        [13] I don't know what word to use for an infinitesimal degree or       divided portion of force: one cannot properly speak of a force       being cut into pieces; but I can think of no other word than       atom.  68. Therefore you have to construct your organic weapon, so that this absolutely and perfectly economized force may be distributed as the bird chooses at any moment. That, if it wants to rise, it may be able to strike vertically more than obliquely;--if the order is, go-ahead, that it may put the oblique screw on. If it wants to stop in an instant, that it may be able to throw its wings up full to the wind; if it wants to hover, that it may be able to lay itself quietly on the wind with its wings and tail, or, in calm air, to regulate their vibration and expansion into tranquillity of gliding, or of pausing power. Given the various proportions of weight and wing; the conditions of possible increase of muscular force and quill-strength in proportion to size; and the different objects and circumstances of flight,--you have a series of exquisitely complex problems, and exquisitely perfect solutions, which the life of the youngest among you cannot be long enough to read through so much as once, and of which the future infinitudes of human life, however granted or extended, never will be fatigued in admiration.  69. I take the rude outline of sail in Fig. 3, and now considering it as a jib of one of our own sailing vessels, slightly exaggerate the loops at the edge, and draw curved lines from them to the opposite point, Fig. 4; and I have a reptilian or dragon's wing, which would, with some ramification of the supporting ribs, become a bat's or moth's; that is to say, an extension of membrane between the ribs (as in an umbrella), which will catch the wind, and flutter upon it, like a leaf; but cannot strike it to any purpose. The flying squirrel drifts like a falling leaf; the bat flits like a black rag torn at the edge. To give power, we must have plumes that can strike, as with the flat of a sword-blade; and to give _perfect_ power, these must be laid over each other, so that each may support the one below it. I use the word below advisedly: we have to strike _down_. The lowest feather is the one that first meets the adverse force. It is the one to be supported.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  Now for the manner of the support. You must all know well the look of the machicolated parapets in mediæval castles. You know they are carried on rows of small projecting buttresses constructed so that, though the uppermost stone, far-projecting, would break easily under any shock, it is supported by the next below, and so on, down to the wall. Now in this figure I am obliged to separate the feathers by white spaces, to show you them distinctly. In reality they are set as close to each other as can be, but putting them as close as I can, you get _a_ or _b_, Fig. 5, for the rough section of the wing, thick towards the bird's head, and curved like a sickle, so that in striking down it catches the air, like a reaping-hook, and in rising up, it throws off the air like a pent-house.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  70. The stroke would therefore be vigorous, and the recovery almost effortless, were even the direction of both actually vertical. But they are vertical only with relation to the bird's body. In space they follow the forward flight, in a softly curved"]]]
