Glyn's father has been for many years a Colonel in the Maharajah's father's army, but now the old Maharajah is dead, and his son, known at school as \"Singh\", has inherited the title.  The Colonel is Singh's guardian.  There are the usual schoolboyish rivalries and fights, in particular involving a nasty individual called Slegge.  A menagerie owner lives nearby, and among his animals is an elephant who is sometimes in a bad mood.  It turns out that Glyn and Singh, who have had dealings with elephants in India, are rather good at bringing it under control.  Singh has brought one of his Princely regalia, a heavily bejewelled belt.  One day it disappears.  Several people are known to be short of cash, so are suspected of the theft.  Nearly half the book is spent in chasing out the culprit, but we get there in the end.  However, there is a surprise ending to the book.  It should be mentioned that the title is a little misleading, for \"schooldays\" covers well over a decade, but the action in this book covers only a few days.  NH  ________________________________________________________________________  GLYN SEVERN'S SCHOOLDAYS, BY GEORGE MANVILE FENN.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE NEW BOYS.  Slegge said it was all \"bosh;\" for fifty years ago a boy at school had not learned to declare that everything which did not suit his taste was \"rot.\"  So Slegge stood leaning up against the playground wall with a supercilious sneer upon his lip, and said it was all \"bosh,\" and only fit for children.  The other fellows, he said, might make idiots of themselves if they liked, he should stop in and read; for Dr Bewley, DD, Principal of the world-famed establishment--a grey, handsome, elderly gentleman in the truest sense of the word--had smilingly said after grace at breakfast that when he was a boy he used to take a great deal of interest in natural history, and that he presumed his pupils would feel much the same as he did, and would have no objection to setting aside their classical and mathematical studies for the morning and watching the entrance of the procession when it entered the town at twelve o'clock.  The boys, who were all standing and waiting for the Doctor to leave the dining-hall, gave a hearty cheer at this; and as the ragged volley died out, after being unduly prolonged by the younger pupils, instead of crossing to the door from the table, the Doctor continued, turning to the mathematical master:  \"I think, Mr Morris, you might be kind enough to tell Wrench to get the boy to help him and place a line of forms by the wall, so that the young gentlemen can enjoy the privilege of having a prolonged private box above the crowd; or, shall I say, a high bank in this modern form of the classic amphitheatre?\"  \"Hear, hear!\" said Mr Rampson, the heavy, solid-looking classical master, impressed by the Principal's allusion to the Roman sports; and he grumbled out something in a subdued voice, with his eyes shut.  What it was the boys did not hear, but it was evidently a Latin quotation, and ended in _ibus_.  The Doctor then marched slowly towards the door, with his black gown floating out around him, and carrying his mortar-board cap by the limp corner; for while everything about him was spick and span--his cravat of the stiffest and whitest as it supported his plump, pink, well-shaven chin, and his gown of the glossiest black--a habit of holding his college cap by its right-hand corner had resulted in the formation of a kind of hinge which made the University headpiece float up and down in concert with his stately steps as he turned his head from side to side and nodded benignantly at first one and then another of his junior pupils.  The masters followed, looking very severe indeed; and, following the example set by Mr Morris, they all frowned and shook their heads at the great waste of time that would follow the passing of the procession.  \"So childish of the old man,\" said Morris to the French master, Monsieur Brohanne, a particularly plump-looking Gaul.  \"The boys will be fit for nothing afterwards.\"  \"_Certainement_!\" said the French master.  \"But I suppose I must give orders for these seats to be placed;\" and as soon as he was outside he summoned Wrench--the pale-faced and red-nosed official whose principal duty it was, with the assistance of a sturdy hobbledehoy (Mounseer Hobby-de-Hoy, as the boys called him) to keep well-blackened the whole of the boots in the big establishment--and gave orders to carry out and run a line of forms all along the outer wall of the great playground, which was continued farther on by the cricket-field hedge.  \"A great waste of time,\" said Morris; but he gave very strict orders to the man-servant that the biggest and strongest form was to be chalked \"Number One,\" and reserved for the masters only.  There was a buzz in the dining-hall which grew into a roar as the door closed.  The boys, who had sat down to breakfast rather wanting in appetite--from the fact that their consciences were not very clear regarding studies in English and French or certain algebraic solutions or arrangements in angles specified by \"A B C\" and \"D E F,\" according to the declarations of a well-known gentleman named Euclid--felt in their great relief as if they would like another cup of coffee and two slices more, for the holiday was quite unexpected.  It was about this time that Slegge gave his opinion to his following, which was rather large, he being the senior pupil and considering himself head-chief of the school, not from his distinguished position as a scholar, but from the fact that his allowance of cash from home was the largest of that furnished to any pupil of the establishment, without counting extra tips.  Slegge, Senior--not the pupil, for there was no other boy of the same name in the school, but Slegge _pere_, as Monsieur Brohanne would have termed him--being sole proprietor of the great wholesale mercantile firm of Slegge, Gorrock and Dredge, Italian warehousemen, whose place of business was in the City of London, and was, as Slegge insisted, \"not a shop.\"  \"You fellows,\" he said, \"can do as you like.  Some of you had better set up a wicket and the net, and come and bowl to me.  Ha, ha! look at Thames and the Nigger!  It will just suit them.  Those Indian chaps think of nothing else but show.  I shan't be at all surprised if the nigger goes up to dress and comes down again in white muslin and a turban.--I say!  Hi!  Thames!  Rivers!  What's your stupid name?  It's going to be a hot day.  You ought to come out with the chow-chow.\"  \"No, no,\" whispered a boy beside him, \"chowri.\"  \"Well, chow-chow, chowri; it's all the same,\" said the big lad impatiently.  \"Horse-tail to whisk the flies away.--Hi! do you hear?\"  \"Are you speaking to me?\" said the tall, very English-looking lad addressed.  \"Of course I am.\"  \"Well, you might address me by my name.\"  \"Well, so I did.  Thames.  No, I remember, Severn!  What idiots your people were to give themselves names like that!\"  \"Well, it's as good as Slegge anyhow,\" said the lad.  There was a little laugh at this, which made the owner of the latter name turn sharply and fiercely upon the nearest boy, who shut his mouth instantly and looked as innocent as a lamb.  \"Look here,\" said Slegge, turning again to the lad he had addressed, \"don't you be cheeky, sir, or you'll find yourself walked down behind the tennis-court some morning to have a first breakfast; and you won't be the first that I have taught his place in this school.\"  \"Oh,\" said the lad quietly, \"you mean fighting?\"  \"Yes,\" said Slegge, thrusting out his chin, \"I mean fighting.  You are new to this place, and you have been coming the stuck-up on the strength of your father being a poor half-pay Company's colonel.  Honourable East India Company indeed!  Shabby set of sham soldiers got-up to look like the real.\"  The face of the boy he addressed changed colour a little, and he drew a deep breath as he compressed his lips.  \"And don't you look at me like that,\" continued Slegge, who was delighted to find a large audience gathering round him to listen while he gave one of the new boys a good setting down, \"or you may find that, after I have done with you, you won't be fit to show your ugly mug in the row of grinning boobies staring over the wall at a twopenny-halfpenny wild-beast show.\"  \"I don't want to quarrel,\" said the lad quietly.  \"Oh, don't you!\" continued Slegge, with a sneering laugh.  \"Well, perhaps I do, and if I do I shall just give your master one for himself as well.\"  \"My master,\" said the lad staring.  \"Yes, your master, the nigger--Howdah, Squashee, or whatever he calls himself.  Here! hi! you, Aziz Singh-Song, or whatever your name is, why don't you dress up and go and get leave from the Doctor to ride the elephant in the procession?  Your father is a mahout out there in India, isn't he?\"  The boy he addressed, who had just come up to lay his hand upon the shoulder of Severn, to whisper, \"What's the matter, Glyn?\" started on hearing this address, and his dark face, which was about the tint of a _young_ Spaniard's, whom he resembled greatly in mien, flushed up and the lips closed very tightly, but only to part again and show his glistening white teeth.  \"My father--\" he began.  \"Bother! come on,\" cried Severn, putting his arm round the other and half-pushing, half-dragging him through the crowd of lads who were clustering round in expectation of a coming set-to.  There was a low murmur as of disgust as the two lads elbowed their way through, whilst Slegge shouted after them.  \"Sneaks!\" he cried.  \"Cowards!  But I haven't done with you yet;\" and as they passed out through the door into the great playground he drew himself up, giving his head a jerk, and then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],["title","Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#1)"],["body","his hands in a very objectionable way, he gave them a rub together, doubled his fists, and threw himself into a fighting attitude, jerking his head to and fro in the most approved manner; and, bringing forth a roar of delight from the little crowd around him, as quick as lightning he delivered two sharp blows right and left to a couple of unoffending schoolfellows, picking out, though, two who were not likely to retaliate.  \"That'll be it, boys, the pair together--one down and t'other come on. Both together if they like.  They want putting in their places.  I mean to strike against it.\"  \"Hit hard then, Sleggy,\" cried one of his parasites.  \"I will,\" was the reply.  \"There you have it;\" and to the last speaker's disgust he received a sharp blow in the chest which sent him staggering back.  \"Now, don't you call me Sleggy again, young man.  Next time it will be one in the mouth.--Yes, boys,\" he continued, drawing himself up, \"I do mean to hit hard, and let the Principal and the masters see that we are not going to have favouritism here.  Indian prince, indeed!  Yah! who's he?  Why, I could sell him for a ten-pun note, stock and lock and bag and baggage, to Madame Tussaud's.  That's about all he's fit for. Dressed up to imitate an English gentleman!  Look at him!  His clothes don't fit, even if they are made by a proper tailor.\"  \"It's he who doesn't fit his clothes,\" cried one of the circle.  \"Well done, Burney!\" cried Slegge approvingly.  \"That's it.  Look at his hands and feet.  Bah!  I haven't patience with it.  The Doctor ought to be ashamed of himself, taking a nigger like that!  Why didn't he come dressed like a native, instead of disguised as an English lad?  And he's no more like it than chalk's like cheese.  Yes, I say the Doctor ought to be ashamed of himself, bringing a fellow like that into an establishment for the sons of gentlemen; and I'll tell him so before I have done.\"  \"Do,\" said the lad nearest to him; \"only do it when we are all there.  I should like to hear you give the Doctor a bit of your mind.\"  Slegge turned round upon him sharply.  \"Do you mean that,\" he said, \"or is it chaff?\"  \"Mean it?  Of course!\" cried the boy hastily.  \"Lucky for you, then,\" continued Slegge.  \"I suppose you haven't forgotten me giving you porridge before breakfast this time last year?\"  \"Here, what a chap you are!  I didn't mean any harm.  But I say, Slegge, old chap, you did scare them off.  I wish the Principal wouldn't have any more new boys.  I say, though, you don't mean to get the wickets pitched this morning, do you?\"  \"Of course I do,\" cried Slegge.  \"Do you want to go idling and staring over the wall and look at the show?\"  \"Well, I--I--\"  \"There, that will do,\" cried Slegge.  \"I know.  Just as if there weren't monkeys enough in the collection without you!\"  At this would-be witticism on the part of the tyrant of the school there was a fresh roar of laughter, which made the unfortunate against whom it was directed writhe with annoyance, and hurry off to conciliate his schoolfellow by getting the wickets pitched.    CHAPTER TWO.  DECLARATION OF WAR.  Meanwhile the two lads, who had retired from the field, strolled off together across the playground down to the pleasant lawn-like level which the Doctor, an old lover of the Surrey game, took a pride in having well kept for the benefit of his pupils, giving them a fair amount of privilege for this way of keeping themselves in health.  But to quote his words in one of his social lectures, he said:  \"You boys think me a dreadful old tyrant for keeping you slaving away at your classics and mathematics, because you recollect the work that you are often so unwilling to do, while the hours I give you for play quite slip your minds.  Now, this is my invariable rule, that you shall do everything well: work hard when it's work, and play hard when it's play.\"  The two lads, Glyn Severn and his companion of many years, Aziz Singh, a dark English boy in appearance and speech, but maharajah in his own right over a powerful principality in Southern India, strolled right away over the grass to the extreme end of the Doctor's extensive grounds, chatting together as boys will talk about the incidents of the morning.  \"Oh,\" cried the Indian lad angrily, \"I wish you hadn't stopped me.  I was just ready.\"  \"Why, what did you want to do, Singhy?\" cried the other.  \"Fight,\" said the boy, with his eyes flashing and his dark brows drawn down close together.  \"Oh, you shouldn't fight directly after breakfast,\" said Glyn Severn, laughing good-humouredly.  \"Why not?\" cried the other fiercely.  \"I felt just then as if I could kill him.\"  \"Then I am glad I lugged you away.\"  \"But you shouldn't,\" cried the young Indian.  \"You nearly made me hit you.\"  \"You had better not,\" said Glyn, laughing merrily.  \"Yes, of course; I know, and I don't want to.\"  \"That's right; and you mustn't kill people in England because you fall out with them.\"  \"No, of course not; I know that too.  But I don't like that boy.  He keeps on saying nasty things to us, and--and--what do you call it?  I know--bullies you, and says insulting things to me.  How dare he call me a nigger and say my father was a mahout?\"  \"The insulting brute!\" said Glyn.  \"Why should he do it?\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, it's plain enough.  It's because he is big and strong, and he wants to pick a quarrel with us.\"  \"But what for?\" cried Singh.  \"We never did him any harm.\"  \"Love of conquest, I suppose, so as to make us humble ourselves to him same as the other fellows do.  He wants to be cock of the school.\"  \"Oh--oh!\" cried Singh.  \"It does make me feel so hot.  What did he say to me: was I going to ride on the elephant?--Yes.  Well, suppose I was. It wouldn't be the first time.\"  \"Not by hundreds,\" cried Glyn.  \"I say, used it not to be grand?  Don't you wish we were going over the plains to-day on the back of old Sultan?\"  He pronounced it Sool-tann.  \"Ah, yes!\" cried Singh, with his eyes flashing now.  \"I do, I do! instead of being shut up in this old school to be bullied by a boy like that.  I should like to knock his head off.\"  \"No, you wouldn't.  There, don't think anything more about it.  He isn't worth your notice.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" said the Indian boy;--\"but what makes me so angry is that he despises me, and has treated me ever since we came here as if I were his inferior.  It is not the first time he has called me a nigger.--There, I won't think anything more about it.  Tell me, what's this grand procession to-day?  Is it to be like a durbar at home, when all the rajahs and nawabs come together with their elephants and trains?\"  \"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Glyn, laughing.  \"Nothing of the kind.\"  \"Then, why are they making all this fuss?  It said on the bills we saw yesterday in the town, `Ramball's Wild-Beast Show.  Grand Procession.'\"  \"I don't know much about it,\" said Glyn; \"only here in England in country places they make a great fuss over things like this.  I asked Wrench yesterday, and he said that this was a menagerie belonging to a man who lives near and keeps his wild-beasts at a big farm-like place just outside the town.\"  \"But why a procession?\" said Singh impatiently.  \"Oh, he takes them all round the country, going from town to town, and they are away for months, and now they are coming back.\"  \"Menagerie! beast show!\" said Singh thoughtfully.  \"They are all tame, of course?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" said Glyn.  \"It said lions and tigers and elephants and camels, and a lot more things on the bills.  I should like to see them.\"  \"You English are a wonderful people.  My father used to have tigers-- three of them--a tiger, a tigress, and a nearly full-grown cub.  But they were so fierce he got tired of keeping them, and when the tigress killed one of the keepers, you remember, he asked your father about it, and they settled that it would be best to kill them.\"  \"Of course, I remember,\" said Glyn; \"and they had a tiger-hunt, and let one out at a time, and had beaters to drive them out of the nullahs, and shot all three.\"  \"Yes,\" said Singh thoughtfully; \"and my father wouldn't let me go with him on his elephant, because he said it wouldn't be safe.  Then these will all be tame tigers and lions?  Well, I shall like to see them all the same, because it will make me feel like being at home once more.  I say, when is your father coming down again?\"  \"Don't know,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"I did ask in my last weekly letter.\"  \"Ah!\" said the Indian boy with a sigh, \"I wish I were you.\"  \"Well, let's change,\" said Glyn laughing.  \"You envy me!  Why, I ought to envy you.\"  \"Why?\" said Singh, staring.  \"Why, because you are a maharajah, a prince; and when you grow old enough you are going back to Dour to rule over your subjects and be one of the biggest pots in Southern India.\"  \"Well, what of that?\" said Singh quietly.  \"What good will that do me? But of course the Colonel will come too.\"  \"Ah, that remains to be seen,\" said Glyn.  \"That'll be years to come, and who knows what will happen before then?\"  \"I don't care what happens,\" cried Singh hotly.  \"He's coming back to India when I go.  Why, he told me himself that my father made him my guardian, and that he promised to look after me as long as he lived.  He said he promised to be a father to me.  It was that day when I got into a passion about something, and made him so cross.  But I was very sorry afterwards,\" said the boy quietly, \"he's such a good old fellow, and made me like him as much as I did my own father.\"  \"Well,\" said Glyn merrily, \"you have always had your share of him.  It has made me feel quite jealous sometimes.\"  \"Jealous!  Why?\" said Singh wonderingly.  \"Because he seemed to like you better than he did me.\"  \"What a shame!\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, I say, you don't mean that, do you, Glyn, old chap?  Why, you don't know how fond he is of you.\"  \"Don't I?\"  \"No; you should hear what he says about you sometimes.\"  \"Says about me?  What does he say about me?\"  \"Oh,"]]]
