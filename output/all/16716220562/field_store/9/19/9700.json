I'm Head Girl, and don't you forget it.  The Queen on her throne is not more absolute than I am in this room.  If you don't do what I tell you, it will be my painful duty to report you for insubordination, and it is a sad thing for a girl to get a mark on her first day.  I must trouble you for that pigtail, if you please.\"  She was speaking the truth, that was evident!  Confirmation was written on every watching face, in every warning frown.  Rhoda's pride battled with a sense of helplessness so acute that she had much ado not to burst into tears on the spot.  The two girls stood confronting each other, the new-comer flushed and quivering, like a beautiful young fury, with her flaxen hair streaming over her shoulders, and her blue eyes sending out sparks of fire; Thomasina composed and square, with her lips pursed up in a good-humoured, tolerant smile.  \"Hurry up!\" she said, and Rhoda whisked round and dashed behind her curtain, which flew out behind in an aggrieved fashion, as if unused to be treated with such scant courtesy.  The next few moments seemed to have concentrated in them a lifetime of bitterness.  The comb tugged remorselessly through the curling locks, but the physical pain passed unnoticed; it was the blow to pride which hurt--the sharp, sharp stab of finding herself worsted, and obliged to give in to the will of another. It was nothing at that moment that the pigtail was ugly and unbecoming; Rhoda would have shaved her head and gone bald for ever if by this means she could have escaped that verdict; but to appear again before all the girls with that hateful, hateful wisp hanging down her back--she felt as if she would die rather than do it; yet would it not be even more degrading to wait for a summons?  She stalked forth, straight and defiant, and was received with a bland smile.  \"Pretty fair for a first attempt.  Plait it down further next time.  I must have my girls neat and tidy.  Now then, forward please--Right, left! right, left!\"  The order was accompanied by a tap on the shoulder, which put the finishing touch to Rhoda's exasperation.  She stepped into her place in the queue, trembling from head to foot, and with a painful throbbing in her head which was something new in her healthy experience.  Immediately in front marched a tall, straight form, whom at first she failed to recognise, but at the head of the staircase there came a temporary wait, and then the head was turned towards her, and, behold, it was Dorothy herself, pigtailed like the rest, and looking curiously reduced without the background of hair.  \"Morning!\" she cried cheerily, and Rhoda gasped a breathless question.  \"You too!  Did she tell you?  I never heard--\"  \"Didn't give her a chance!  Heard her ordering you, and nipped mine up in a trice.  Treat it as a matter of course, and don't seem to mind-- that's the tip!  Only get yourself disliked by making a fuss.\"  \"I know, but I _can't_ help it,\" sighed Rhoda dismally.  \"I'm not used to bullying, and it makes me wild.  My head's splitting. I feel all churned up.\"  \"Worse troubles at sea!\" said Dorothy shortly, and after that there was no more chance of conversation, for the queue moved on again, and they were separated at breakfast as at dinner the night before.  Thomasina sat opposite to Rhoda, and pressed the various dishes upon her good- temperedly, ignoring all causes of discord, an attitude which, if she had only known it, but added to the score against her, for pride forced a haughty \"No, thanks,\" whilst appetite prompted \"Yes, please.\"  To sit with empty plate, and see others feast on bread and marmalade is no slight trial when one is fifteen and a-hungred, but no one urged Rhoda to change her mind, or thought it possible to succeed where the Head Girl failed.  There were no regular lessons during the morning, but a great deal of confusing moving to and fro from one class-room to another, to go over preliminary arrangements, and receive instructions from the mistresses. Sometimes the new girls were ignored altogether, and then they felt worms, and ready to sink through the earth; sometimes they were questioned as to their attainments, and then the very walls seemed to have ears, and their replies echoed through a deadly silence.  Dorothy attained a fair level throughout, and reaped neither praise nor blame, but Rhoda knew alternate rapture and despair, as Mademoiselle and Fraulein beamed approval, and the \"class-mistress\" put up her eye- glasses and regarded her as one might regard a wild animal at the Zoo, upon hearing that she had \"done\" no Latin or mathematics.  \"You will not do much good at this school without them,\" she said, severely.  \"They are the most important subjects.  I advise you to give all the time you can spare to working them up, and to get, if possible, some coaching during the holidays.  That is, of course, if you wish to excel.\"  If she wished to excel!  _If_, indeed!  Did any one suppose for a moment that Rhoda Chester would be content to remain among the rank and file? Did they think that she could continue to be ignored, and live!  Ten thousand times no!  \"A day would come!\" as Disraeli had said.  They thought just now that she was nobody, but in time to come the school would know her name, would be proud of it, would boast of it to other schools.  Rhoda reared her head and smiled complacently, and the class- mistress noted the action, and made a mental note that the new pupil must be \"kept down.\"  The morning seemed very long, but it came to an end at last with a blessed ten minutes \"off\" before preparing for dinner.  The other girls hurried to their cubicles, but Rhoda waylaid Miss Everett in the corridor, and appealed to her in breathless eagerness.  \"You said I was to come to you in any difficulty...  I want to know if it is necessary for me to wear my hair like this?  I never do it at home, and I'm sure my mother wouldn't like it.  Is it really the rule?\"  \"I'm afraid it is,\" said Miss Everett kindly.  \"You don't like it, eh? Well, I don't wonder!  I shouldn't myself, in your place; but you see, dear, bending over desks, and running about at games, loose hair gets in the way, and cannot possibly be kept tidy.  It seems an arbitrary rule, but there's reason in it, as there is in all the rules if you think them out, and it doesn't apply to every day.  On Thursday evening we have `Frolics,' and then you can wear it loose, and put on your prettiest things.  There is always something going on--concerts, dances, or theatricals--and Miss Bruce likes the girls to look bonnie and festive. On Sundays, too, you can go back to your mop if you choose.  I hope you will, for I like to see it.  I have a little sister with hair just like yours.\"  She laid her hand affectionately on the curly head, and the touch of kindliness acted as balm to Rhoda's sore heart.  Her eyes glistened with unshed tears, and she said huskily:  \"I'll do anything _you_ tell me.  I won't mind; but that Thomasina-- she's hateful!  I can't stand being ordered about by a girl of my own age.\"  \"Ah-h!\" cried Miss Everett, and sighed as at the recurrence of a well- known trouble.  \"Well, you know, Rhoda, you must get over that feeling, and conform to the rules of the school.  Thomasina is a great help to me, and makes a capital `head girl.'  You see, dear, I have no time to look after these details.  The girls think that they are busy, but long after they are asleep at night I am slaving away correcting exercises. Oh such piles of books! it makes me tired even to see them.  I'll do what I can for you, but you mustn't expect too much; and after all, in a week or ten days you will have mastered the rules, and the difficulty will be over.  You wouldn't make a fuss for one week, would you?  Stay! There is one thing I _can_ tell you now, and that is that you won't be allowed to wear those slippers any longer.  I'll give you an order, and you can go downstairs to the bureau and get a pair of school shoes like the other girls wear.\"  Rhoda gasped with dismay.  \"What!  Those frightful things with square toes and no heels!  Those awful tubs that Thomasina waddles about in!\"  Miss Everett laughed gaily.  She was only a girl herself, and she cast a quick glance up and down the corridor to see if any one were coming before she drew aside her skirt to exhibit her own flat feet.  \"They _are_ awful!  I love pretty shoes, too; and the first time I wore these I--I _cried_!  I was very home-sick, you see, and nervous and anxious about my work, and it seemed the last straw.  Never mind! it's only a little thing, and on Thursday you shall wear your very best pair and I'll wear mine, and we'll compare notes and see which is the prettier.\"  To say that Rhoda adored her is to state the matter feebly.  She could have knelt down in the passage and kissed the ugly little feet; she could have done homage before this young mistress as before a saint; when the light streamed out of a window and rested on her head, it seemed to take the form of a halo!  She went meekly downstairs, procured the shoes, and carried them into Dorothy's cubicle, to display before the eyes of that horrified young woman.  \"There!  We've got to wear those, too!  It's the rule.  Miss Everett told me, and gave me an order to get them.  You had better ask her for one before Thomasina gets a chance.\"  Dorothy looked at her solemnly, and measured the slipper against her own neat shoe; then she took off the latter and held the two side by side. One was arched and slim, the other flat and square; one had French heels and little sparkling buckles, the other was of dull leather, unrelieved by any trace of ornament.  \"Here's deggeradation!\" she sighed hopelessly.  \"Here's deggeradation!\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THE RECORD WALL.  There was no end to the surprises of that wonderful school!  When Rhoda returned to her cubicle to get \"tidy\" for dinner,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],["title","Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#0)"],["body","Nature                 Won by Kindness              _WILD NATURE WON BY KINDNESS._                  _BY THE SAME AUTHOR._    MORE ABOUT WILD NATURE.

Two short chapters, one describing the life of an Ant-lion, and the other the habits of a tame Toad, were added to the second edition, which was in other respects a reproduction of the first.  The present edition has been improved by the adoption of a number of illustrations which were designed for the German translation of this book.    [Illustration]     INTRODUCTION.   I have often wished I could convey to others a little of the happiness I have enjoyed all through my life in the study of Natural History. During twenty years of variable health, the companionship of the animal world has been my constant solace and delight. To keep my own memory fresh, in the first instance, and afterwards with a distinct intention of repeating my single experiences to others, I have kept notes of whatever has seemed to me worthy of record in the life of my pets. Some of these papers have already appeared in _The Animal World_; the majority are now printed for the first time.  In the following chapters I shall try to have quiet talks with my readers and tell them in a simple way about the many pleasant friendships I have had with animals, birds, and insects. I use the word friendships advisedly, because truly to know and enjoy the society of a pet creature you must make it feel that you are, or wish to be, its friend, one to whom it can always look for food, shelter, and solace; it must be at ease and at home with you before its instincts and curious ways will be shown. Sometimes when friends have wished me to see their so-called \"pet,\" some scared animal or poor fluttering bird has been brought, for whom my deepest sympathy has been excited; and yet there may have been perhaps the kindest desire to make the creature happy, food provided in abundance, and a pleasant home; but these alone will not avail. For lack of the quiet gentle treatment which is so requisite, the poor little captive will possibly be miserable, pining for liberty, hating its prison, dreading the visits of its jailor, and so harassed in its terror that in some cases the poor little heart is broken, and in a few hours death is the result. In the following simple sketches of animal, bird, and insect life, I have tried to show how confidence must be gained, and the little wild heart won by quiet and unvarying kindness, and also by the endeavour to imitate as much as possible the natural surroundings of its own life before its capture. I must confess it requires a large fund of patience to tame any wild creature, and it is rarely possible to succeed unless one's efforts begin in its very early days, before it has known the sweets of liberty.  In many cases I have kept a wild animal or bird for a few days to learn something of its ways, possibly to make a drawing of its attitudes or plumage, and then let it go, else nearly all my pets, except imported creatures, have been reared from infancy, an invalid's life and wakefulness making early-morning feeding of young fledglings less difficult than it would have been in many cases, and often have painful hours been made bearable and pleasant by the interest arising from careful observation of the habits and ways of some new pet animal or bird.  I have always strongly maintained that the love of animated nature should be fostered far more than it usually is, and especially in the minds of the young; and that, in fact, we lose an immense amount of enjoyment by passing through life as so many do without a spark of interest in the marvellous world of nature, that book whose pages are ever lying open before us.  The beauties of the country might as well have been left uncreated for all the interest that thousands take in them. Not only town dwellers, who might be excused for their ignorance, but those who live in the midst of fields and woods, often know so little about the curious creatures in fur and feathers that exist around them that they are surprised when told the simplest facts about these, their near neighbours.  One reason may be, that it is now so much the fashion to spend the year in various places, and those always moving about have neither the time nor opportunity to cultivate the little undergrowths of quiet pleasures which spring out of a settled home in the country, with its well-tended garden and farmyard, greenhouses, stable, and fields--the horses and cattle, petted and kindly cared for from their birth, dogs and poultry, and all kinds of special favourites.  There is a healthy, happy tone about such a life, and where it exists and is rightly maintained, good influence is, or ought to be, felt in and around the home. Almost all children have a natural love of living creatures, and if they are told interesting facts about them they soon become ardent naturalists. I well remember that in my childhood I had a great dread of toads and frogs, and a relative, to whom I owe much for having directed my mind into the love of animated nature, took up a frog in her hand and made me look at the beautiful gold circle round its eyes, its curious webbed feet, its leaping power arising from the long hind legs; she told me also of its wonderful tongue, so long and flexible that it folded back in its mouth, and that the frog would sit at the edge of an ant-hill and throwing out the tongue with its sticky point, would pick off the ants one by one as they came out. When I learnt all this, I began to watch such a curious reptile; my fears vanished, and like Kingsley's little daughter, who had been wisely led to care for all living things and came running to show her father a \"dear delightful worm\" she had found! so I, too, have been led all through my life to regard every created thing, great or small, attractive or otherwise, as an object well worth the most reverent study.  Perhaps I ought to explain that I have described methods of taming, feeding, and housing one's pets with extreme minuteness in order to help those of my readers who may be very fond of live creatures, and yet from lack of opportunity may have gained no knowledge of their mode of life, and what is required to keep them happily in health and vigour. I have had to learn by experience that attention to very small details is the road to success in keeping pets as well as in other things, and the desire to pass on that experience must be my excuse to more scientific readers for seeming triviality.  Many admirable books have been written by those well qualified to impart their knowledge in every branch of Natural History, and the more such books are read the better, but the following pages simply contain the life histories of my pets and what I personally have observed about them. I shall be glad indeed if they supply any useful information, or lead others to the more careful study of the common every-day things around them with a view to more kindness being"]]]
