I say ship of the line,       because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one       of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the       general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of       a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as       the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an       immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been       supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this       hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those       of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,       parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,       thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in       shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the       rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the       apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each       wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above       the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale       apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper       and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief       peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s       Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was       as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,       as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded       the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,       with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming       evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I       perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand       themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so       expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the       monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to       the floor.            Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of       what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of       repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.            At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we       were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I       occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near       at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an       account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed       heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if       my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a       distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute       terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but       maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the       course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the       hill.            I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an       omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I       threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my       face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer       apparent.            My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,       and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the       visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed       deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,       with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative       philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.       I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the       idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in       the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the       importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its       propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence       to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of       Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly       be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can       you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought       this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”                  He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one       of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to       exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine       print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the       book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.            “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,       I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.       In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus       Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class       of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:            “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic       appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of       the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and       downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;       antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The       Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,       at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia       of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”                  He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself       accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding       “the monster.”                  “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face       of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.       Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for       the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider       has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of       an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch       distant from the pupil of my eye.”     HOP-FROG         I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed       to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to       tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his       seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They       all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well       as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there       is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been       quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara       avis in terris.            About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king       troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in       a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.       Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”       to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited       his taste far better than verbal ones.            At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone       out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still       retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were       expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,       in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.            _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he       _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the       heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to       mention himself.            His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value       was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf       and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;       and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days       (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to       laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your       jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and       unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our       king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a       triplicate treasure in one person.            I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his       sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of       the seven ministers, on account of his inability to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2151"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 5 (#4)"],["body"," as other men       do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional       gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that       afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,       for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional       swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a       capital figure.            But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only       with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious       muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way       of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform       many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,       or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more       resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.            I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog       originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no       person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.       Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself       (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been       forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,       and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.            Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close       intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became       sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was       by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many       services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although       a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much       influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit       of Hop-Frog.            On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined       to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,       occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta       were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive       in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and       arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it       seems, without his assistance.            The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been       fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could       possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of       expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed       that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up       their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,       in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except       in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never       could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found       it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all       events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and       Hop-Frog.            When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him       sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the       monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not       fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and       madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,       and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)       “to be merry.”            “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the       room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here       Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We       want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of       the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the       wine will brighten your wits.”                  Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances       from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor       dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced       the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he       took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.            “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly       drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,       your eyes are shining already!”                  Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of       wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He       placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the       company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at       the success of the king’s ‘joke.’            “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.            “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your       assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of       characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was       seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.            Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.            “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”                  “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,       abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.            “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you       mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.       Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and       offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.            “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the       fiends—”                  The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers       smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,       falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.            The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her       audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most       becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a       syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the       brimming goblet in her face.            The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,       resumed her position at the foot of the table.            There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling       of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a       low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once       from every corner of the room.            “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the       king, turning furiously to the dwarf.            The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his       intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,       merely ejaculated:            “I—I? How could it have been me?”                  “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.       “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his       cage-wires.”                  “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,       on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of       this vagabond’s teeth.”                  Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object       to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very       repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as       much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another       bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and       with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.            “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very       tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just       after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just       after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd       noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one       of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our       masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,       it requires a company of eight persons and—”                  “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the       coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!       what is the diversion?”                  “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and       it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”                  “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering       his eyelids.            “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it       occasions among the women.”                  “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.            “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that       to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of       masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will       be as much terrified as astonished.”                  “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the"]]]
