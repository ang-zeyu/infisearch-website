His side was to leap.  \"Go on, go on!\" shouted Buttar.  Ernest had for some time practised vaulting; he ran, measuring his distance, and sprang over the heads of all the boys right up to the wall.  \"Bravo!\" cried Buttar, delighted, \"you'll do, I see; there's no fear of you now.\"  Ernest felt much pleased by the praise bestowed on him by his new friend, and turning round he waved to the other boys to come on.  The last boy failed, and his side had to go under.  He proved as staunch, however, with two heavy boys on his shoulders, as any of the most practised players, and his side were much oftener riders than horses.  \"I say, though, you don't mean to say, Bracebridge, that you have never been to school before?\" said Buttar, as they were summoned away to their bedrooms.  \"I should have thought, from the way you do things, that you were an old boy.\"  Ernest assured him that he had never been in any school whatever, and that he had associated very little with any boys, except his own brothers.  \"I'll tell you how it is,\" he continued; \"my father says we should do everything on principle.  He has made us practise all sorts of athletic exercises, and shown us how we can make the best use of our muscles and bones.  The balls of the foot and toes are given us, for instance, as pads from which we may spring, and on which we may alight, but clumsy fellows will attempt to leap from their heels or jump down on them; however, I'll tell you what I know about the matter another time.  He has us taught to row and swim, and climb and ride.  He says that they are essential accomplishments for people who have to knock about the world, as all of us will have to do.  He has always told us that we must labour before we can be fed; it is the lot of humanity.  If we by any chance neglected to do what he ordered, we had to go without our dinner or breakfast, as the case might be; so you see we have learned to depend a good deal upon ourselves, and to feel that if we do not try our best to get on, no one else will help us.\"  \"Oh, yes!  I understand now why you are so different to most new boys,\" answered Buttar.  \"Well, your father is a sensible man, there's no doubt of it.  I got on pretty well when I first came, much from the same reason.  My mother never let us have our own way, always gave us plenty to do, and taught us to take care of ourselves without our nurses continually running after us.  Now I have seen big fellows come here, who cried if they were hit, were always eating cakes and sweet things, and sung out when they went to bed for the maid-servant to put on their night-caps; these sort of fellows are seldom worth much, either in school or out of it.  They fudge their lessons and shirk their work at play; regular do-nothing Molly Milksops, I call them.\"  And the two boys laughed heartily at the picture Buttar had so well drawn.  Off each room was a washing-place, well supplied with running water, and a bath for those boys who could not bathe in the pond.  Ernest's bed was pointed out to him.  Approaching it, he knelt down, and while most of the boys were washing, said his prayers.  Only one boy in a shrill voice cried out in the middle of them, Amen.  When Ernest rose up he looked round to try and discover who had used the expression.  All were silent, and pretended to be busily employed in getting into bed; two or three were chuckling as if something witty had been said.  \"I will not ask who said, Amen,\" remarked Ernest in a serious voice. \"But remember, school-fellows, you are mocking, not a poor worm like me, but God Almighty, our Maker.\"  Saying this, he placed his head on his pillow.  \"A very odd fellow,\" observed two or three of the boys; \"I wonder how he will turn out.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  ERNEST'S FIRST DAYS AT SCHOOL.  The next morning, when he got up, Ernest was told, after prayers, to take his seat on a vacant bench at the bottom of the school, till the Doctor had time to examine him.  He felt rather nervous about his examination, for he had been led to suppose it a very awful affair.  At last the Doctor called him up and asked him what books he had read. Ernest ran through a long list; Sir Walter Scott's novels, and Locke on the Human Understanding, were among them.  The Doctor smiled as he enumerated them.  \"I fear that they will not stand you in good stead here, my man; the books I mean are Greek and Latin books.  What have you read of them?\"  \"None, sir, right through.  I know a great number of words, and can put them together, and papa and I sometimes talk Latin and Greek together, just as easily as we do French and German and Italian.\"  \"I have no doubt that you will do in the end,\" observed Doctor Carr.  \"I make a rule, however, to put boys who have not read certain books in the class in which those books are about to be read, and let them work their way up.  I reserve the power of removing a boy up as rapidly as I think fit, so that if you are diligent I have no doubt that you will rapidly rise in the school.\"  Ernest thanked the Doctor, and in the forenoon went up with his new class.  He felt rather ashamed at finding himself among so many little boys, and still more at the bungling, hesitating way in which they said their lessons.  They were just beginning Caesar.  He found that he could quickly turn it into English, but he took his dictionary that he might ascertain the exact meaning of each word.  The Doctor called up his class that day, though he generally heard only the upper classes. Ernest began at the bottom, but before the lesson was over he had won his way to the top of the class.  \"Very good indeed, Bracebridge,\" said the Doctor with an approving smile; \"you may read as much Caesar as you like every day.  I will beg Mr Johnson to hear you, and when you have got through it you shall be moved into the next class.\"  Many of the boys thought this a very odd sort of reward, and were much surprised to hear Ernest thank the Doctor for his kindness.  They would have considered it a greater reward to be excused altogether from their lessons.  Much more surprised were they to find Ernest working away day after day at his Caesar, and translating as much as Mr Johnson had time to listen to.  He read on so clearly and fluently that most of the boys declared that he must have known all about it before.  A few felt jealous of him, and tried to interrupt him; but he went steadily working on, pretending to take no notice of these petty annoyances launched at him.  In the course of a fortnight he was out of the class and placed in the next above it.  This he got through in less than a month, and now he found himself in the same with Buttar, Dawson, and Bouldon.  They welcomed him very cordially, though they could not exactly understand how he managed so quickly to get among them.  The two latter, however, were especially indignant when they discovered his style of doing his work.  \"It's against all school morality,\" exclaimed Tommy, with a burst of virtuous anger.  \"How should we be ever able to get through half our lessons if we were to follow your plan?  You must give it up, old fellow; it won't do.\"  \"I am sorry that I cannot, to please you,\" answered Ernest.  \"You see, I want to read through all these books, that I may get to higher ones which are more interesting; and then I want to get to College as soon as possible, that I may begin life.  Our days in this world are too short to allow us to waste them.  If I get through school twice as fast as any of you, I shall have gained so many years to my life.  That is worth working for--is it not?\"  \"My notion is, that we should do as few lessons and amuse ourselves as much as we can,\" answered Tom Bouldon.  \"When we are grown up there will be time enough to think of employing time; I do not see any use in looking forward to the future, which is so far off.\"  \"What are we sent into this world for, do you think?\" asked Ernest.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Bouldon.  \"To spend the money which is left us, or to go into professions to make our fortunes,\" observed Dawson.  \"I should think rather to prepare for the future,\" remarked Ernest.  \"So my father has always told me, and I am very sure that he is right.  We are just sent into this world to prepare for another, and that preparation is to be made by doing our duty to the best of our power in that station of life in which we are placed.  It is our duty when we are boys to prepare for being men, by training our minds and bodies, and by laying in as large a share of knowledge as we can obtain.\"  \"Oh, that's what the saints say!\" exclaimed Dawson, with a laugh.  \"We shall very soon christen you the saint, Bracebridge, if you talk in that way.\"  \"I don't mind what you may call me,\" said Ernest, quietly; \"I only repeat what a sensible man has told me; I am very certain that he has only said what he knows to be the truth.\"  Neither Dawson nor Bouldon would be convinced that Ernest was talking sense, but Buttar, who was listening, drank in every word he said.  He had at first felt an inclination to patronise the new boy, but he now tacitly acknowledged him as his superior in most respects, except perhaps a small amount of the details of school knowledge.  Ernest, however, had been too carefully trained by his father to presume on this superiority.  He, of course, could not help feeling that he did many things better than most of his companions, but then he was perfectly conscious that if they had possessed the advantages his father had given him, they would probably have done as well.  With the ushers he was a favourite, especially with his own master, who was under the impression that the rapid progress he made was owing to his instruction; while"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21452"],["title","Ernest Bracebridge: School Days (#4)"],["body","Carr soon perceived that he was likely to prove a credit to the school.  Ernest, however, was not perfect, and he had trials which were probably in the end good for him.  Some of the elder boys were jealous of the progress he made, and called him a conceited little puppy.  Blackall, who was only in the third class, and had from the first taken a dislike to him, did not like to see him catching him up, as he called it.  With mere brute force Ernest could not contend, so that he got many a cuff and kick from the ill-disposed among the elder boys, which he was obliged to take quietly, though he might have felt the inclination to resent the treatment he received.  At length he began to prefer the hours spent in school, because he was there certain of being free from the annoyances in the playground.  The bigger boys did not condescend to play with hoops, but Ernest was very fond of all games played with them.  Buttar and he were generally on one side, opposed to Dawson and Bouldon.  \"Who's for prisoners' base?\" exclaimed Buttar coming out from school into the playground with his hoop in his hand.  Plenty of boys were ready to join, and soon there was a tremendous clattering away with hoop-sticks and hoops, while Ernest was seen with a light thin hoop, dodging in noiselessly among them.  His hoop-stick was as light as his hoop, which he never beat.  He merely pressed the stick against it, and in an instant, by placing the stick on the top, could either stop or turn, while he kept it under the most perfect command. The sides were soon arranged.  Out he darted with his swift hoop towards the enemy's prison, which he circled round; and though Tom Bouldon was on the watch to catch him, he kept dodging about till another of his own side ran out, in the hope of knocking down Bouldon's hoop.  Bouldon was in honour bound to follow Ernest till he touched his hoop, or drove him back to his base.  Ernest drove on his hoop to a considerable distance, with Tommy after him.  Jones, one of Ernest's side, pursued Tommy, Dawson pursued Jones, and Dawson, in his turn, was followed by Buttar, and so on, till every one playing was out with the double work of having to try and make a prisoner, and, at the same time, to escape from the boy pursuing him.  To a spectator not knowing the game, it might have appeared as if all was confusion: but those playing knew exactly what they were about, and felt that all their energies and science were required to enable them to play well.  Ernest's great aim was to lead Bouldon into such a position that Jones might catch him.  This he at last succeeded in doing, and Tommy and his hoop were sent into prison, and as no one was at the base, there he had every chance of remaining some time.  Meantime, Ernest rushed to the base, to be ready to capture any one who might get back on the opposite side and endeavour to rescue Bouldon.  He was joined speedily by Jones, who had only to look out so as to escape from Dawson.  Dawson might have caught him, but, being himself pursued, he had to take care of his own safety.  When Dawson saw that Jones had escaped him, he could with honour return to his camp; but his pursuer was nimble of foot, and had a light hoop, and just before he reached his base, he, or rather his hoop, was touched, and he had to take up his place in the prison.  Thus the game continued with great animation, victory appearing now to lean to one side, now to the other; but on each occasion when their side got the worst of it, Ernest and Buttar made such well-directed efforts that they speedily restored the day.  Now, all but three on their side were captured.  Out sprung Ernest with his hoop, flying like the wind; and while his opponents were looking on at the rapidity of his movements, Buttar, who had thrown himself on the ground, as if exhausted, leaped up, and dashing along, had recovered a prisoner before any one could overtake him.  Ernest in like manner regained another, and wheeling round as soon as he had entered the base, he was off again, and had sent an opponent to prison, and rescued another friend, without for a moment stopping.  Sometimes he would tell Buttar exactly what he was going to do, and so well were his plans laid, that he seldom failed to accomplish his design.  This gave him confidence in himself, and gained him the perfect confidence of his companions.  At length Ernest and Buttar succeeded in putting every one of their opponents in prison, and loud shouts from their side proclaimed that they had won the well-contested victory.  The game was over; the light hoops were laid aside, and Dawson proposed that they should play at English and French.  Their chargers, as they called their heavy hoops, were brought out from the play-room, and the two parties, joined by a good many more, drew up on opposite sides of the field.  Even some of the bigger fellows condescended to join in the game.  It was generally supposed to depend more on strength than skill.  The strongest hoops were used, and if a hoop was once down, the owner was obliged to retire from the field.  Just as they were about to begin, Blackall passed by.  Dawson instantly called to him--  \"I say, Blackall--there's a good fellow--do come and be our captain. Here's my biggest hoop--it's a stunner!  Under your guidance it is sure to gain us the victory.\"  \"Well, I don't mind helping you,\" answered Blackall, carelessly, eyeing, however, Ernest and Buttar, for both of whom he had an especial dislike.  \"That won't do,\" observed Buttar, who was one of the captains of his party.  \"Stay, I'll get Lemon to join us.  He won't mind taking a hoop-stick to help us; and he, and you, and I, together with a few other good fellows and true, will be able to hold our own against Dawson and Tommy, even though they have Bully Blackall with them.\"  Buttar soon found Miles Lemon, who, though he was reading an interesting book, jumped up with the most good-natured alacrity, and undertook to act as the leader of their party.  \"Oh, you fellows were afraid to take care of yourselves!\" exclaimed Blackall, when he saw Lemon and Buttar approaching.  \"Well, we will see what we can do.\"  There were full thirty boys on each side--nearly half the school.  None of the bigger boys, of course, condescended to play with hoops. Blackall and Lemon, indeed, made it understood that they only joined as leaders, and on no account for their own amusement, while there were a good many small boys who were considered too weak to take part in so rough a sport.  The armies were drawn up in double line, one at each end of the gravel playground.  At a signal given, they rushed forward to the deadly strife, some striking away at their heavy hoops with all their might, and using clubs rather than hoop-sticks.  Ernest offered a great contrast to those heavy chargers.  He entered the battle with his light hoop and hoop-stick, and when the signal was given, rushed forward in the van to commence the strife.  On came Blackall, highly indignant to see a new boy taking the lead in so prominent a way.  He struck his hoop with a force sufficient to overthrow not only Ernest's hoop, but Ernest himself; but the young champion knew well what he was about.  Instead of waiting for the blow, by a dexterous turn he brought the edge of his light hoop against the side of Blackall's, which went reeling away among the following crowd, and was instantly upset.  Ernest was in time to treat another hoop of the second line in the same fashion, and then he sprang on with a shout of victory to the end of the ground.  Several times the two parties changed sides, and each time five or six hoops went down, sometimes more.  It was a regular tournament, such as was fought by the knights of old, only hoops were used instead of horses, and hoop-sticks in lieu of lances; but the spirit which animated the breasts of the combatants was the same, and probably it was enjoyed as keenly.  Blackall stood on one side, eyeing with revengeful feelings the success which attended Ernest wherever he moved.  Backwards and forwards he went; and although constantly charged and marked out for destruction by the biggest fellows on the opposite side, always avoiding them, and seldom failing to strike down one or more hoops in every course. Blackall could not understand how it was.  He was not aware what a well-practised eye, good nerves, and a firm will could accomplish. Ernest's father had instilled into him the principle, that whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing as well as it can be done.  So, when he took a hoop in his hand, he considered how he could use it to the best advantage; and from the first, he never played with it without endeavouring to perfect himself in some method of turning it here or there, of stopping it suddenly, or of twirling it round.  A second time that day did Ernest's party come off victorious.  Some said that it was owing to Lemon having joined them: but Lemon himself confessed that he had not done half as much execution as had young Bracebridge.  From that day Lemon noticed Ernest in a very marked way, and when he spoke to him treated him as an equal in age.  Some of his first companions declared that, to a certainty, Bracebridge would be very much cocked up by the attention shown him; but they were mistaken, for he pursued the even tenor of his way without showing that he by any means thought himself superior to his companions.  The Easter holidays arrived.  Those who lived near enough to the school went home; but as the boys were generally collected from widely separated parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the greater number remained.  They had greater liberty than at any other time, and were allowed to make long excursions with one of the masters, or with some of the bigger boys who, from their good principles and steadiness, were considered fit to be entrusted with them.  Lemon was high enough in the school to have that honour, and so Ernest and Buttar always"]]]
