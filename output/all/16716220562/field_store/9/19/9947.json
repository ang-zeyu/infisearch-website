The body of the little man was more       than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a       rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen       at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was       occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car,       or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were       enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected into       a queue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and       inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and       cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and       double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a       semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd       little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue       satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles       at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a       white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and,       to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief       enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his       bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.        Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet       from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was       suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared       disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing       out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he       lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant.       He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract       from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book.       This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air       of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.       He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter       sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let       it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von       Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut,       still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther       business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make       busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to       discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the       half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without       taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of       them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and       rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in       the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed,       however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on       the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is       said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his       one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than       one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to       which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to       which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.        In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far       away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud       similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus       lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of       Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the       descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had       proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity       to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during       his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the       important subject of securing the packet in question, which was       seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands,       being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in       their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the       Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by       those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the       following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication:        “To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and       Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city       of Rotterdam.        “Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble       artizan, by name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of       bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam,       about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered       by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If,       however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this       communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It is well       known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty       years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at       the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at       the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided       therein time out of mind—they, as well as myself, steadily       following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of       mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years,       that the heads of all the people have been set agog with       politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen       of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good,       employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack       of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began       to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism,       and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very       best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to       think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could       do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of       intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it       could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government       grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired       durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was       not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of       a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state       of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and,       having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length       became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting       upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life.       Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation.       My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that       I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against       the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular       who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about       my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I       internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so       happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in       the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from       putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing       my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to       dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair       words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of       vengeance should be afforded me.        “One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more       than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander       about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at       length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s       stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I       threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened       the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It       proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy,       written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of       somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information       on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed       in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice       before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me.       By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps       toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on       my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved       carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible       reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages       which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary       manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew       the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature       of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on       subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering       me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or       inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen       in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to       imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough,       to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in       ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2147"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 1 (#7)"],["body","   effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent       properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step       farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely       speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity       and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that       truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that,       in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek       her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.       Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas.       In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly       that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much       precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and       undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance       in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware       that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the       visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light       than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and       some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an       eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices       of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the       bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of       which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star       offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with       the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my       mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.        “It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed.       My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the       whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning,       and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I       repaired eagerly to the bookseller’s stall, and laid out what       little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes       of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home       safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal,       and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I       thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals       of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three       creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally       succeeded—partly by selling enough of my household furniture to       satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of       paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I       told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited       their services. By these means—for they were ignorant men—I found       little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.        “Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife       and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what       property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under       various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future       means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money.       With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals,       cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine;       a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of       wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary       in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary       dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as       possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the       particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the       twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a       hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a       spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications,       and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then       took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation       east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty       gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes,       three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in       length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or       semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a       very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter       materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than       myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The       secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of       right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was       conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual       submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a       method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain       animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an       impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and       was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a       coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention       this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the       individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the       novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to       deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.        “On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy       respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug       a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle       twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being       the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three       feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a       canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg       holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These—the       keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered       trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about       four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the       cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about       an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the       remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their       destined situation.        “Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot,       and there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the       apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this       machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it       could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it       applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance,       I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My       balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty       thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I       calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly,       with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the       bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the       cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite       as strong and a good deal less expensive.        “Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of       secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first       visit to the bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to       return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what       little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no       fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman,       and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I       believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle       boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in       the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark       night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as       aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much       trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements,       by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were       deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded       immediately to business.        “It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was       dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain,       falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my       chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the       varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy       with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I       therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,       pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid       in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with       questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus,       and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made       them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good       was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely       to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get       uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe       the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the       devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing       better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of       their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them       by promises of payment of all scores in full, as"]]]
