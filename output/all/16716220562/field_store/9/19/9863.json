But this picture was a fine likeness of her at the time I painted it.... I suppose,\" he added, \"I was the first one in the whole valley to perceive that she was going to be a beauty when she got her full growth.\"  \"Do you suppose she'll send me the picture, if I ask her, so I can show it to Dusty Moth?\" Freddie asked.  Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit doubtful. He pondered for a few moments. And then he said:  \"I'll tell you what I'll do! To-morrow morning I'll see Betsy and I've no doubt that she'll loan me the picture if I promise to return it to her.\"  \"That'll be great!\" cried Freddie. \"Meet me near the duck pond as soon as it's dark to-morrow night; and be sure to bring Betsy's picture with you!\"  Then Freddie Firefly hurried off to find Dusty Moth, who happened likewise to be looking for him, because he had a question to ask.  They met shortly. And Dusty Moth immediately cried:  \"Have you heard from her?\"--meaning Betsy Butterfly, of course.  \"Now, see here!\" Freddie Firefly said. \"It's plain enough that Betsy doesn't care to meet you. But I have a plan that ought to suit you well enough. If you could look at her picture once you'd be satisfied, wouldn't you?\"  \"I would--\" replied Dusty Moth--\"if I got my appetite back afterward.\"  \"Well, will you promise to stop pestering me about Betsy Butterfly if I let you see this picture of her?\"  \"Yes! yes!\" Dusty promised impatiently. \"Where is it? Quick! Let me see it!\"  \"Oh! You'll have to wait till to-morrow night,\" Freddie explained.  \"I shall not be able to eat a single mouthful till then!\" Dusty Moth groaned.  \"Well--you can suit yourself about that,\" Freddie told him impatiently. \"And please don't speak to me again to-night! I've been troubled enough on your account without being bothered by you any more.\"  \"One moment!\" cried Dusty, as Freddie Firefly started to leave him.  \"Well--what do you want now?\" Freddie growled, flashing his light impatiently in Dusty Moth's eyes.  \"Are you sure she will let you take the picture?\" Dusty asked him.  \"Yes! yes! Of course she will! Why shouldn't she, I should like to know? You certainly do ask the silliest questions!\"  And yet Freddie Firefly had put the same query himself, to Jimmy Rabbit, only a short time before. But now he was quite certain that his worries were almost at an end.  \"Betsy Butterfly has caused me a powerful lot of trouble!\" Freddie grumbled, as he hurried over the hollow, to join in the dance of the Firefly family.     XX  SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG   WHEN Jimmy Rabbit went to see Betsy Butterfly the next morning he found her quite willing to let him take her picture away with him.  \"But I must say--\" Betsy remarked--\"I must say that I don't understand why anybody should want to borrow this old portrait. Everyone tells me I have changed a great deal since you made it.\"  \"That's true,\" Jimmy Rabbit agreed. \"But the person to whom I'm going to show it won't know the difference.\"  \"I don't believe he knows me, then,\" she remarked.  \"No! And probably he never will,\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"But don't you worry about that! From what I hear of him, he's a good deal of a bore.\"  \"Don't bother to bring back that picture!\" she called to Jimmy Rabbit as he hopped away.  \"I'm afraid Betsy Butterfly is growing vain,\" he murmured to himself. \"To be sure, she _has_ changed. But I shall always like this portrait of her, because I painted it myself.\"  Later, when he was in Farmer Green's garden, he wrapped the picture carefully in a rhubarb leaf and hid it beneath a pile of brush. And he didn't come back for it until after dark, just as the moon peeped above the rim of the hills.  At the duck pond Jimmy Rabbit found Freddie Firefly waiting for him, hopping up and down and flashing his light through the misty gloom.  \"Did you get it?\" Freddie demanded.  \"It's safe in my pocket,\" Jimmy assured him.  \"Let me have it!\" said Freddie. \"Dusty Moth is waiting for me at the fence-corner, near the orchard. And I want to give him a good look at Betsy Butterfly's picture before the moon gets too high, for he can't see well if there's too much light.\"  Jimmy Rabbit drew the picture carefully from his pocket. And Freddie Firefly took it and slung it across his back. He fairly staggered under the weight.  \"Aren't you going to look at Betsy's picture yourself?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked him. \"It's a good bit of work, if I do say so.\"  \"Oh! I don't care about seeing it. It's nothing to me, you know,\" said Freddie carelessly. \"But I hope Dusty Moth will be satisfied with it.\"  \"Well, I won't go with you, to see if he is,\" Jimmy Rabbit told him. \"I usually have a light lunch at this hour. So I'll meet you here at the duck pond after I come back from the cabbage patch.\"  They parted then. And shortly afterward Freddie Firefly dropped down beside Dusty Moth, who made no attempt to conceal his pleasure.  \"At last!\" he cried. \"At last I am to behold the beautiful Betsy Butterfly's picture!... I do hope it's a good likeness!\" he added as he began, with trembling hands, to unwrap the rhubarb covering from the portrait.  \"It certainly is,\" Freddie Firefly assured him. \"It was made by a friend of mine, who once painted a famous picture of old Mr. Crow.\"  While Freddie danced along the top of the fence, Dusty Moth carried the picture into the shade of an apple tree, out of the moonlight, so that he might see it more clearly.  A few moments later Freddie Firefly was both surprised and alarmed to hear a cry of anguish from the direction of the apple tree.  \"What's the matter?\" he called. \"There's nothing wrong, I hope?\"  But Dusty Moth made no reply.     XXI  A STRANGE CHANGE   RECEIVING no answer to his question, Freddie Firefly skipped down from the fence and sought the shade of the apple tree, where he found Dusty Moth staring fixedly at Betsy Butterfly's picture.  Dusty's face wore a most curious look; he seemed at once angry, sorrowful and amazed. And not till Freddie Firefly asked again what _was_ the trouble did Dusty Moth say a word.  Then he pointed scornfully toward the portrait that Jimmy Rabbit had made earlier in the summer.  \"So that's the charming Betsy Butterfly, eh?\" he roared. \"That's the beauty I've heard so much about! I can tell you right now that if I had any idea she looked like this I never would have lost my appetite over her!\"  \"You astonish me!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed. \"Have you forgotten how anxious you were to meet the lady?\"  \"Meet her!\" Dusty Moth howled. \"I promise you I'd never go out of my way to meet anybody that looked as she does--though I might go a long distance to avoid her.\"  Freddie Firefly glanced toward the picture. But it had fallen face downward upon the ground. And he did not take the trouble to raise it.  \"Well, you think Betsy Butterfly is beautiful, don't you?\" he asked.  \"Indeed I don't! I think she's hideous,\" Dusty Moth shouted. \"Never in all my life have I been so deceived in a person.\"  \"I don't understand how you can say that,\" Freddie Firefly told him. \"But I suppose your idea of beauty may be different from mine--and from many other people's, too. Anyhow, I hope you'll get your appetite back again.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" said Dusty Moth. \"Just now I don't feel as if I ever wanted to taste food again.\" A shudder passed over him. And he covered his eyes, as if to shut some terrible image from his memory.  \"I must leave you now,\" said Freddie Firefly. \"And please don't forget what you promised me. You remember that you said that if I'd show you a picture of Betsy Butterfly you would stop pestering me about her.\"  \"Don't worry about that!\" Dusty Moth assured him bitterly. \"I shall never mention Betsy Butterfly's name again. I don't want to think of her. But I'm afraid I can never, never get her face out of my mind.... I know--\" he added--\"I know I shall see it in my dreams. And just think how terrible it will be to wake at midday, out of a sound sleep, with her dreadful face and form haunting me!\"  Freddie Firefly couldn't help feeling sorry for the poor chap. But he could think of nothing to do, except to show him Betsy's portrait once more. So he started to raise the picture from the ground, where it still lay face downward. And the moment Dusty Moth saw what he was about he gave a frightful scream--and flew off into the night.  \"He's a queer one!\" Freddie Firefly mused. \"Now, I've always thought Betsy was a fine-looking----\" Just then his eyes fell upon the picture for the first time. And Freddie Firefly's mouth fell open in astonishment.  So amazed was he by what he saw that he tumbled right over backwards. And then, scrambling to his feet, he wrapped the rhubarb leaf hastily around the picture and slung it across his back again.  \"Jimmy Rabbit has made a terrible mistake!\" he groaned, as he started for the duck pond.         *       *       *       *       *  Back at the meeting place once more, Freddie Firefly rushed up to Jimmy Rabbit in great excitement.  \"Do you know what you did?\" he cried. \"You brought me the wrong picture. And Dusty Moth has gone shrieking off into the darkness, he was so disappointed. This is not Betsy Butterfly's picture! It's some dreadful-looking caterpillar. And when I glanced at it just now, over in the orchard, it sent a chill all through me.\"  For the time being Jimmy Rabbit said nothing. At first he had seemed quite upset. But before Freddie had finished speaking he had begun to smile. And then he unwrapped the picture once more and leaned it against a stone, where the moon's rays fell squarely upon it.  \"You're mistaken,\" he informed Freddie then. \"This _is_ a picture of Betsy Butterfly. I painted it myself; and I ought to know. As I explained last night, I made it earlier in the summer; and as I said, she has changed somewhat in the meantime. But it's a very good likeness of her as she was once.\"  \"You mean--\" gasped Freddie Firefly--\"you mean that Betsy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],["title","The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#7)"],["body","was once an ugly caterpillar?\"  \"Why, certainly!\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"And so was Dusty Moth, for that matter. Yes! he was a caterpillar himself, once--and a much uglier one than Betsy, if only he knew it.  \"In fact,\" said Jimmy, looking at the picture with his head on one side, \"as caterpillars go, Betsy Butterfly was a great beauty, even at so early an age.\"     XXII  THE SKIPPER   IN Farmer Green's meadow there lived a very nervous person called the Skipper. He was a distant cousin of Betsy Butterfly's. And since the two were almost exactly the same age, they quite naturally spent a good deal of time together.  The Skipper was of a dark, somber brown shade. And it always seemed to the gaily colored Betsy that he tried to make up for his dull appearance by being extremely lively in his movements. He was forever skipping suddenly from one place to another--a trick which had caused people to call him by so odd a name.  Much as she liked this queer cousin, Betsy often found his uncertain habit somewhat annoying. It was not very pleasant, when talking to him, to discover that he had unexpectedly left her when she supposed he was right beside her, or behind her. If she had anything important to tell him she frequently had to hurry after him. And the worst of it was, once she had overtaken him she never knew when he would dart away again.  As the summer lengthened it seemed to Betsy Butterfly that the Skipper grew more flighty than ever. Once she had been able to say a few words to him before he went swooping off. But now--now she could not even tell him that it was a nice day without following her cousin at least half an hour in order to finish her remark.  \"You're becoming terribly fidgety,\" Betsy told him at last. \"If you don't look out you'll have nervous prostration--or I shall, if you don't stop jumping about like a jack-in-the-box. I advise you,\" she said, \"to see a doctor before you get any worse.\"  Of course, it must not be supposed that Betsy Butterfly could say all that to her cousin without going to a good deal of trouble. As a matter of fact, she had to follow him about the fields for two whole days and travel several miles before she succeeded in finishing what she wanted to say to him.  \"Why, I feel fine!\" the Skipper cried. \"I don't need a doctor. I----\"  He started to skip away from the wild morning-glory blossom on which he had perched himself. But Betsy caught him just in time--and held him.  \"Now, you listen to me!\" she commanded. \"You're in a dangerous condition. Some day someone will come to you with an important message. And if you go sailing off the way you do, how's he ever going to tell the whole message until it's too late, perhaps?\"  \"If it was good news it wouldn't hurt it to keep it a while,\" the Skipper asserted cheerfully. And he gave a quick spring, with the hope of escaping from Betsy's grasp. But she held him firmly by the coat-tails.  \"Suppose I wanted to warn you not to go near the flower garden, because Johnnie Green was waiting there for you with his net, to capture you and put you in his collection? You might be sorry, afterwards, if you didn't sit still and listen to me.\"  \"That's so!\" said the Skipper. \"I hadn't thought of that. I'd see a doctor at once; but I don't know any.\"  \"Go to Aunt Polly Woodchuck, under the hill,\" Betsy Butterfly advised him. \"She's the best doctor for miles around.\"  So they went, together, to call on Aunt Polly. The old lady looked at the Skipper and shook her head. \"I can't help him,\" she said.  Betsy asked anxiously, \"Is his trouble catching?\"  \"No, indeed!\" said Aunt Polly. \"He can't stay in one place long enough to give it to anybody.\"  Well, after that Betsy saw very little of her cousin the Skipper. But she did not mind that, especially since she soon made the acquaintance of a very agreeable young gentleman, who dressed in the height of fashion. He wore a swallowtail coat every day. And the neighbors all said that his manners were delightful.  _He_ never went skipping off while Betsy Butterfly was talking to him.
