I've got something to say to him.\"  Mrs Packer, wholly at a loss to understand her youthful guest, but at the same time disposed to be indulgent to his little whims, said Tom would be at lessons now, and she didn't think he would be able to come.  \"Wouldn't it do in the morning?\"  \"Oh no,\" said Charlie, with the gravest face.  \"I must see him to-night, please, if you don't mind.\"  The housekeeper concluded that Charlie had some important message from the mother to her son, and therefore rang for a servant, whom she despatched with a message to Master Drift that some one wanted to see him.  In a very little time that hero made his appearance; and as he was the first Randlebury boy Charlie had set eyes on, he appeared for a moment a very awful and a very sublime personage in that little new boy's eyes. But Charlie was too intent on his mission to allow himself to be quite overawed.  \"Here's a new boy, Master Drift, wants to speak to you.\"  \"What do you want, young un--eh?\"  \"Oh, it's all right, Tom Drift; only I saw your mother, you know, in the train, and she said you were a nice boy, and she sent her love, and I told her I'd let you know the time whenever you wanted, because you ain't got a watch, you know, and I have.  I say, would you like to know the time now, Tom Drift?\"  All this was rattled out with such eager volubility, that Tom Drift, hero as he was, was fairly taken aback, and looked quite sheepish, as the beaming boy proceeded to pull me out of his pocket.  \"Well, it's just--hullo!\"  He saw in an instant something was wrong.  \"Why, it says only half-past six--that must be wrong!\"  \"It's eight o'clock by the hall clock,\" said Mrs Packer; \"it's just now struck.\"  Charlie looked at me, opened me, held me to his ear, and then exclaimed,--  \"Oh! my watch has stopped!  My watch has stopped!  What shall I do?\" and the poor boy, overwhelmed with his misfortune, held me out appealingly, and scarcely restrained the tears which started to his eyes.    CHAPTER FOUR.  HOW I WAS CURED OF MY AILMENTS, AND HOW MY MASTER BEGAN LIFE AT RANDLEBURY.  All this while Tom Drift had said nothing, but had stood regarding first my master, and then me, with mingled amusement, pity, and astonishment. At last, when poor Charlie fairly thrust me into his hands, that he might see with his own eyes the calamity which had befallen the watch that had been destined to minister such consolation to his time- inquiring mind, he took me gingerly, and stared at me as if I had been a toad or a dead rat.  \"Can't you make it go, Tom Drift?  Please do.\"  \"How can I make him go?  I don't know what's the row.\"  \"Do you think it would be a good thing to wind it up?\" asked Charlie.  \"Don't know; you might try.\"  Charlie did wind me up; but that was not what I wanted.  Already I had had that done while waiting at Gunborough Junction.  \"What do you say to shaking him?\" asked Tom Drift presently.  Most people spoke of me as \"it,\" but Tom Drift always called me \"him.\"  \"I hardly like,\" said Charlie; \"_you_ try.\"  Tom took me and solemnly shook me; it was no use.  I still remained speechless and helpless.  \"Suppose we shove his wheels on?\" next suggested that sage philosopher.  Charlie demurred a little at this; it seemed almost too bold a remedy, even for him; however he yielded to Tom's superior judgment.  The heir of the house of Drift accordingly took a pin from the lining of his jacket, and, taking off my coat and waistcoat, proceeded first to prod one of my wheels and then another, but in vain.  They just moved for an instant but then halted again, as stiff end lifeless as ever.  For a moment the profound Tom seemed baffled, and then at last a brilliant idea occurred to him.  \"I tell you what, I expect he's got damp, or cold, or something.  We'd better warm him!\"  And the two boys knelt before the fire with me between them, turning me at the end of my chain so as to get the warmth on all sides, like a leg of mutton on a spit.  Of course that had no effect.  What was to be done?  No winding up, no shaking, no irritation of my wheels with a pin, no warming of me at the fire, could avail anything.  They were ready to give me up.  Suddenly, however, Tom, who had been examining my face minutely, burst into a loud laugh.  \"What a young donkey you are!\" he cried.  \"Don't you see his hands are caught?  That's what's the matter.  The minute-hand's got bent, and can't get over the hour hand.  You're a nice chap to have a watch!\"  It might have occurred to Charlie (as it did to me) that whatever sort of watch-owner the former might be, a boy who successively shook, tickled, and roasted me to get me to go, was hardly the one to lecture him on his failings; but my master was too delighted at the prospect of having his treasure cured to be very critical of the physician.  And this time, at last, Tom Drift had found the real cause of my indisposition.  In endeavouring to pass one another at half-past six, my two hands had become entangled, and refusing to proceed in company, had stopped where they were stopping my circulation and indeed my animation at the same time.  Once more the astute Tom produced his pin; and sticking it under the end of my minute-hand, disengaged it from its fellow and bent it back into its proper position.  Instantly, as if by magic, the life rushed back into my body; my circulation started afresh, and my heart beat its old beat.  Charlie set up a shout of jubilation, and almost hugged Tom in his gratitude.  The latter looked very wise and very condescending--as had he not a right?--and, handing me back to my master, said, with the air of a physician prescribing a course of treatment for a convalescent patient,--  \"You'd better shove him on to the right time, and then keep him quiet, young un.\"  This Charlie did, and it would be hard to say which of us two was the happier at that moment.  I had scarcely been deposited once more into my accustomed pocket, when a loud bell sounded down the corridors, and made Tom Drift jump as if he had been shot.  \"I say, that's the prayer-bell!  Come on! unless you want to get into a jolly row.\"  And without further words he seized the astonished Charlie by the arm, and ran with him at full speed along one or two empty passages, dashing at last in through a big door, which was in the very act of closing as the two reached it.  Charlie was so confused, and so out of breath with this astonishing and frantic race, that for a minute he did not know whether he was standing on his head or his heels.  There was, however, no time for solving the problem just then, for Tom Drift, still retaining his grasp on his arm, dragged him forward, whispering,--  \"This way; wasn't that a close shave?  Get in here, and don't make a noise.\"  Charlie obeyed, and found himself in a pew, one of a congregation of some two hundred boys, assembled in the school chapel for evening prayers.  At the far end of the chapel he could hear a man's voice, reading; but what it said it was impossible for him to make out, owing to the talking that was going on around him.  He looked eagerly and curiously down the long rows of his new schoolfellows, feeling half afraid at the sight of so many new faces, and half proud of being a Randlebury boy, with a right to a seat in the chapel.  And as he looked he saw some faces he thought he should like, and some that he thought he would dislike; there were merry, bright-eyed boys, like himself, and there were ill-tempered, sullen-looking boys; there were boys haggard with hard-reading, and boys who looked as if their heads were altogether empty.  But what puzzled and troubled Charlie not a little was to notice, that though the school was supposed to be at prayers, and though most of them must have been within hearing of the reader's voice, a considerable proportion of the boys before him were neither listening nor evincing in their behaviour the slightest sign of reverence for the service in which they were engaged.  He was sorry to see that Tom Drift was laughing and whispering with his companions; entertaining them with an account of the way in which he had set the new \"young un's\" watch to rights, and what a shave they had from being shut out from prayers.  (Charlie wondered, as he noticed all this, whether, after all, he would have lost much good if that misfortune had happened.)  And one or two boys were chewing toffee; at least, Charlie thought it must be toffee, their mouths were so brown, and they made such a noise over the process of mastication; some, with their hands in their pockets, were listlessly staring up at the roof; and some were reading books, anything but prayer-books, under the desk.  Charlie did his best to attend to what the invisible and inarticulate voice was saying, and tried to recall what his father had told him about not letting new scenes and new companions tempt him to forget of neglect the lessons of duty and religion which he had learned at his parents' home; but it was not easy work, and to him it was a relief when all was over, and the boys proceeded to file out of the chapel.  \"Where are they all going?\" he inquired, turning round to where Tom Drift had been standing.  That young man, however, was no longer there.  He had gone off to enjoy the questionable luxury of roast potatoes in a friend's study, entirely forgetting his young and forlorn charge.  Charlie was puzzled.  He was sure he could never find his way back to Mrs Packer's through such a maze of passages, and he knew not where else to go.  As he stood watching in despair the last remnant of his fellow- worshippers passing out, and wondering what was to become of him, he became aware of two big boys stopping in front of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],["title","The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#5)"],["body","and looking at him.  \"That's him!\" said one, whose grammar was perhaps not his strongest point at this moment.  \"Why, he's only a kid!\" said the other, who, being sixteen, felt fully justified in so designating my young master.  \"I can't help that, I know it's him,\" said the first.  \"I say, you fellow,\" added he, addressing Charlie, \"wasn't it you drove up to the front door in a cab this afternoon?\"  Charlie trembled in his shoes.  More than once had his heart misgiven him, he had committed an unpardonable offence in the mode of his advent to Randlebury; and now, with these two awful accusers before him, he felt as if his doom was come.  \"I'm very sorry,\" he began; \"yes, it was--I didn't mean, I'm sure.\"  \"What did you do it for, if you didn't mean, you young muff?--why don't you go off to bed?\"  \"Because I don't know where to go, and Tom Drift--\"  \"Do you know Tom Drift?\"  \"Yes--that is, I met his mother,\" stammered Charlie, becoming more and more embarrassed.  Both the big boys burst out laughing.  \"What a treat for his mother!\" said one.  \"I suppose she told you Tom was a real nice boy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I thought so; so he is, isn't he, Joe?\" and both boys laughed again.  \"And she gave you a kiss to take to him?\"  \"No,\" said Charlie, blushing scarlet; \"she did give me a kiss, but not for him.\"  It was a hard effort for the poor boy to come out with this admission, but candour compelled it.  \"Oh, she gave you one for yourself, did she?\" and again they laughed. \"What a dear old noodle she must be!\"  \"She was very kind to me,\" said Charlie, not liking to hear his friend made fun of.  Just then a master came by.  \"What are you three boys doing here?\" he asked.  \"Please, sir, this is a new boy,\" replied he who had been called Joe, \"and he doesn't know where to go.\"  \"Hum!\" said the master, \"I thought Mrs Packer would have seen after that.  Let me see.  You had better take him to your dormitory to-night, Halliday; there's a vacant bed there.  Bring him to the doctor's room after breakfast to-morrow,\" and he passed on.  \"Here's a treat!\" exclaimed Joe, with a not ill-natured grin.  \"This comes of stopping and talking to young scarecrows.  Come along, youngster; think yourself lucky you've been handed over to me.  I wear patent leather boots, and they don't need as much blacking as some of the fellows'.\"  Charlie was at a loss to understand what the material of Master Halliday's boots had to do with his own alleged good fortune in falling into the hands of such a guardian; but he said nothing, and, reassured by the good-humoured face of his conductor, followed him cheerfully from the chapel.  \"Hullo, Joe! got a donkey at last?\" cried some one, as the two wended their way up the stairs leading to the dormitories.  \"Looks like it,\" was Joe's reply.  It was not very long before Charlie learned that the four-footed beast thus vaguely referred to was a polite term which the big boys at Randlebury used to designate their fags.  \"Come in here,\" said his conductor, turning in at a small door.  Charlie found himself inside a small apartment, measuring about ten feet square, lighted by a small window, warmed by a small fire, decorated with a small bookcase, and furnished with a small table, two small chairs, and a small cupboard.  \"This is my den; and mind when you clean the window you don't crack that pane more than it is; and when you brush my things, you know, see the shelf isn't dirty, because I sometimes keep my worms there--do you hear? And now come along to bed; they put out lights at half-past nine.\"  The mention of the time recalled me instinctively to Charlie's thoughts. He could not resist the temptation, suggested half by anxiety and half by vanity, of taking me out and looking at me.  \"Hullo!  What, have you got a watch?\"  \"Yes,\" said Charlie meekly, not exactly knowing whether his companion would be admiring or indignant with him.  \"More than I have,\" was all Joe's rejoinder.  Charlie's generosity was at once touched.  \"Oh, never mind, we can go shares sometimes, if you like, you know,\" said he, not without an effort.  \"I don't want your watch,\" was Master Halliday's somewhat ungracious reply.  \"Let's have a look at it, will you?\"  He took me, and examined me; and evidently would not have objected to be the possessor of a watch himself, though he tried to make it appear it was a matter of indifference to him.  \"Why don't you get your father to give you one?\" asked Charlie innocently.  \"Because I haven't got a father.\"  \"Not got a father!  Oh, I am sorry!\" and the starting tears in the little fellow's eyes testified only too truly to his sincerity.  \"Look here,\" he added, \"do take the watch, please; perhaps you would like it, and my father would give me another.\"  Joe Halliday gazed at his young fag in amazement.  \"Why, you are a queer chap,\" he said.  \"I wouldn't take your watch for anything; but I tell you what, I'll ask you the time whenever I want to know.\"  \"Will you really?\" cried the delighted Charlie.  \"How jolly!\"  \"And look here,\" continued Halliday, \"take my advice, and don't go offering your watch to everybody who hasn't got a father, or some of them might take you at your word, and then you'd look foolish.  Come along now.\"  And he led the boy into the dormitory, where there were about twenty beds, most of them already occupied by boys, and the rest waiting for occupants, who were rapidly undressing in different parts of the room.  \"Look sharp and tumble in,\" said Joe, pointing out the bed Charlie was to have.  \"There's only five minutes more.\"  Charlie, with all the naturalness of innocence, knelt, as he was always used to do, and said his prayers, adding a special petition for his dear absent parents, and another for the poor boy who hadn't got a father.  He was wholly unaware of the curiosity he had excited by his entrance into the dormitory, still less did he imagine the sensation which his simple act of devotion was creating.  Twenty pairs of eyes stared at the unwonted spectacle of a boy saying his prayers, and many were the whispered comments which passed from lip to lip.  No one however (had any been so inclined) stirred either to disturb or molest him--an immunity secured to him as much perhaps by the fact of his being under the protection of so redoubtable a champion as Halliday as by any special feeling of sympathy for his act.  The good example was not, however, wholly lost, for that same night, after the lights were out, and when silence reigned in the room, more than one boy covered his head with his sheet and tried to recall one of the early prayers of his childhood.  As for Charlie, with me and the knife under his pillow, he slept the sleep of the just, and dreamt of home; and I can answer for it his weary head never turned once the livelong night.    CHAPTER FIVE.  HOW MY MASTER ENTERED AND QUITTED THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY TWICE IN ONE MORNING.  Charlie's first care in the morning was, as I need hardly say, to pull me out from under his pillow, and consult me as to the time.  None of his companions were astir, so that, not having anything particular to do, he lay still, and abandoned himself to the luxury of an idle half- hour in bed.  His spirits were so greatly revived by his night's rest that he forgot both the novelty and the loneliness of his position, and fell to polishing first his knife and then me as merrily as if he were at home. What a difference a sound sleep often makes in the aspect of our affairs!  Twelve hours ago he had felt as if he could never be sufficiently bold as to whistle within the walls of Randlebury, and now the first sight and sound which greeted Halliday's returning senses, as he sat up and rubbed his eyes, was his young _protege_ whistling to himself like a lark, and brightening me up with all his might with the corner of his blanket till I glowed again at nearly a red heat.  \"Who's that kicking up that row whistling?\" growled a voice from the far end of the room; \"because I'd like to shy a boot at his head.\"  At this Charlie subsided, not desiring to gratify his unknown auditor in his benevolent desire, and very soon after jumped up and dressed himself.  \"Look here, youngster,\" said Joe, \"you'd better do my study now, as you mayn't have time after breakfast to-day.  You know which room it is--the sixth on your right when you get downstairs.  Cut along, look sharp, you've a good half-hour.\"  Charlie made his way down to the lion's den, meeting on his way several other discontented fags, bound on similar errands.  He set himself to clean the window, tidy the cupboard, and generally put things square, and had succeeded fairly well in this endeavour by the time his patron made his appearance.  \"What's the time?\" inquired that lord of creation, running his eye rapidly round the room at the same time, to notice how his fag had done his duty.  \"It's five minutes to eight,\" replied Charlie, after consulting me, and highly delighted to be thus appealed to.  \"Come along to breakfast, then.  You'll have to sit at a different table from me; but mind and wait for me afterwards, for I've got to take you to the doctor.\"  So Charlie was conducted down to the hall to breakfast, and provided with a humble seat at the foot of the lowest table, while Joe Halliday made his way with all the dignity that became his years to a distinguished place at the highest.  My master found himself among a set of noisy little boys, who amused themselves during the greater part of the meal by interchanging volleys of bread pellets, which much oftener missed their marks than reached them, in consequence of which he himself came in for the brunt of the cannonade.  Once he ventured to return one of the random shots which had found its way to his fingers.  Fortune favoured his aim, and his shaft hit the boy it was intended for full in the eye.  \"Who did that?\" cried the wounded hero sharply.  \"I did,\" replied Charlie, quite proud of his achievement.  \"All right, I'll punch your head for it"]]]
