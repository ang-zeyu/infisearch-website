When he hinted at the possibility of the rifle being in fault, his father smiled, and Dick gave him so comical a look that Jack said no more, but rode on silently by the side of the waggon, till, seeing his disappointment, his father joined him.  \"Why, you foolish boy,\" he exclaimed, \"it was not likely that you would hit one of those flying bok.  It is a matter of long practice; and even the Boers, who have studied such shooting for years, often miss.\"  \"But you see, father, I did make such a dreadful mess of it,\" pleaded Jack.  \"I came off my horse; and then I shot over and over again, and missed.  I can't help feeling what a muddle I made.\"  \"Well, for my part,\" said his father, \"I am rather glad that you failed. If you had succeeded, my boy, without effort at the first trial, it would have made you careless.  These failures will teach you the necessity for using care, and trying to perfect yourself as a marksman.\"  \"But there'll be no bok for dinner,\" said Jack ruefully.  \"Never mind,\" replied Mr Rogers.  \"I daresay the boys will bring in something.\"  He was right, for Coffee and Chicory brought in six great plain partridges, which they had knocked down with their kiris, and these were roasted at the midday meal, and eaten with the appetite found in the desert.  As the day wore on, and after the refreshed oxen were once more doing their duty, the effects of the last night's scare began to show itself, Peter, Dirk, and Dinny declaring that they had seen lions creeping after the waggon in the distance, ready to pounce upon the oxen as soon as it was dark.  Dirk reported this to Mr Rogers, who gave them all a good, talking to about their cowardice.  \"Why, look at these Zulu boys,\" he cried; \"they don't show any fear, while you grown men are almost as bad as children.\"  \"Sure, sor, an' the Zulu boys don't know any better,\" said Dinny. \"They're little better than the bastes themselves.\"  \"Well, there are my own boys,\" exclaimed Mr Rogers.  \"They are not afraid.  I wonder at you, Dinny, an Irishman, and to set such a bad example to these blacks.\"  \"And is it afraid?\" said Dinny.  \"Not a bit of it.  I'm not a bit afraid at all; but I can't help thinking of what my poor mother's feelings would be if she came to know that her only son Dennis had been aiten up by wild bastes.  I don't mind a bit, but I wouldn't hurt her feelings for the world.\"  \"Then oblige me, Dinny, by holding your tongue, for if I hear any more complaints I shall send you back.\"  \"Sind me back!\" ejaculated Dinny, as soon as his master had gone.  \"Sind me back across the big desert all alone by meself.  Why, it would be worse than murther.  It's meself wishes I hadn't come.\"  Whatever he may have wished, these sharp words had the effect of silencing Dinny for the time being; but when the Zulu had led them at last, just at sundown, into a dense patch of forest, where the overhanging trees made the gloom quite oppressive, Dinny's eyes showed white circles round them; and if it had not been for the fact that they found a Boer and his family encamped by the water they had been seeking, the Irishman would have probably turned, and at all risks have fled.  People are ready enough to make friends out in the desert, and the Boer gladly offered the use of the fire he had made, and a part of the springbok he had shot, on receiving a share of some of the good things brought by the newcomers.  Then, with the great camp-kettle simmering over the fire, and with the boys patiently waiting for their share of the provisions, guns were cleaned and laid ready for use, the men the while busily attending to the oxen and horses, while the Zulu and his boys collected wood into a pile to keep up the fire.  \"Sure an' it's a dreadful melancholy-looking place,\" said Dinny with a shudder.  And then he listened attentively while the Boer expressed his belief that there were lions in the neighbourhood, though they were not often seen.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  HOW NATURE WAS STRONGER THAN TRAINING.  Days and days of steady travel, and the slowly gained miles mounted up till they had journeyed far into the interior.  Mr Rogers, yielding to the importunities of his boys, had several times over been ready to come to a halt; but the Zulu still pointed forward, and feeling that there must be much truth in his declarations regarding the game country on ahead, he was allowed to act as guide.  It was a long journey, but though they did not have much sport, it was not monotonous, for Mr Rogers was a good naturalist, and eager to collect everything curious in beetle, butterfly, and bird, so that all hands were pretty busy from dawn to dark.  Coffee and Chicory, after they had been taught not to pull off the feathers, became very clever at skinning birds, some of which had been denizens of the woods, some of the lagoons and marshes they had passed, and which were shot at daybreak, or else after sunset, from amongst the great beds of reeds. Then if they were ducks, the bodies became occupants of the great pot; if they were not considered eatable they fell to the share of the dogs.  That great iron pot, which was always suspended from three poles over every fire that was made, became an institution.  The idea was taken from a hint given by a hunting-party, one of the gentlemen forming it telling Mr Rogers that, upon returning weary and exhausted to camp, there was nothing so restorative us good rich soup.  Consequently, whenever a buck was shot, great pieces of its flesh were placed in the pot, and allowed to stew till all their goodness was gone, when the blacks considered them a delicacy, the rich soup being the portion of the hunting-party.  Game was scarce, but they got a sufficiency of either small bok or birds to supply their wants; and, whether it was the constant change, the fresh air, the rich meat essence which Dick partook of with avidity, or whether it was a combination of the effect of all these, the change in the boy was magical.  He could take a long ride now without feeling weary, and wanting in appetite; he was ready to buckle to and help when the waggon was stuck, literally putting his shoulder to the wheel with a will, and in place of hanging back, he was now the first to spy out game, and set off in chase, making Jack quite envious by coming back in triumph with a couple of springbok hanging from his saddle-bows, both having had to succumb to his rifle.  But this was not to be borne; and Jack at once took Chicory into his confidence.  \"I must shoot a springbok, Chick,\" he said.  \"Dick has shot two.\"  \"Boss Jack shoot springbok to-morrow,\" said the boy, decisively; and soon after daybreak roused his young master, and pointed out across the plain towards the rising sun.  \"Bok,\" he said laconically; and while Jack was giving a finishing touch or two to his dress, the boy ran off, and began to saddle Stockings, having the little horse ready by the time Jack was prepared to mount.  The others were not awake, saving the Zulu and Dick, who had the morning watch; so Jack got off unquestioned, and rode away in the direction pointed out by Chicory, whose dark eyes made out the presence of the little bok long before they could be seen by his young master, who began to think that he had been deceived, and expressed his doubts upon the point.  But Chicory smiled, and laid his hand upon Jack's arm, pointing to where some shadow shapes of animals could be seen through the faint mist hanging over a low clump of hillocks; and with a cry of joy the boy pressed his horse's sides, and went off at a swinging canter, without discomposing Chicory in the least, for the boy held on to a strap at the pummel of the saddle as before, and there being no ant-bear hole in the way, or, the horse having learned better through his fall, they rapidly neared the little herd, which began the antics peculiar to these animals, till the lad was getting close up, when they began to flee at a tremendous rate.  Quick as thought, Jack had sprung from his saddle, and sent a bullet after the herd; then another, and another; but all apparently without result.  Then disappointed and vexed, Jack turned to Chicory as if it was his fault.  But the boy had climbed an old ant-hill, and was watching the flying herd with his eyes shaded by his hand.  \"One down--two down,\" he cried, sending joy through Jack's breast; for, on galloping after the herd, it was to find one bok lying dead, and another so badly wounded that it became an easy capture.  It was with no little importance then that Jack rode back with his two bok, ready to receive the congratulations of his father, for his manifest improvement in handling his rifle, and in hunting the bok according to the accepted plan.  At last their guide, after looking-on with something almost supercilious in his face at this, to him, puny style of hunting, and contentment with such small game as birds, springbok, and the like, announced that the next day they would be entering upon what he termed his hunting country.  The travellers had now reached a more rugged tract of land, scored with deep ravines, along which, at some time or another, small rivers must have coursed, while now the narrow stony tracks were found convenient for waggon tracks, though often enough the way was cruelly difficult, and all had to set to and clear a passage for the wheels by bodily removing some of the worst of the stones.  There was no hesitation or hanging back at such times, for all had to set to, even Dinny playing a pretty good part, considering that he abhorred manual labour.  Quite a change seemed to have come over the General, as Dick aptly dubbed their Zulu guide; for though he gave way in everything connected with the management of the waggon, and was exceedingly respectful to Mr Rogers, no sooner did any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],["title","Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#8)"],["body","matter come to the front, or a question of the best direction to take, than he seemed to take the lead as if in spite of himself.  At first Mr Rogers felt annoyed, and ready to put the man down; but in a very short time he saw that the Zulu's sole thought was for the success of the expedition, and that his actions were the natural results of his former life; for, savage though he was, and servant to this expedition, he had been a prince in his own tribe, and a leader amongst the people.  The night was coming on fast, when one day, after a long and weary trek, the heavily-laden waggon was approaching a belt of elevated forest-land, where the General had assured Mr Rogers they would find water.  It had been a toilsome day, hot and dusty, and at their midday rest there had been hardly a mouthful of herbage for the tired oxen, while water there was none.  The contents of the two casks swinging behind the waggon were jealously guarded for the travellers' use; but so miserable did the cattle seem that the two boys asked their father to tap one of them for the oxen and horses.  \"It will be but a taste a-piece,\" he said; \"but perhaps you are right, boys.\"  Then the tap being set running, every ox and horse had a refreshing taste, though it was hard work to get the pail away from each thirsty mouth.  Then all through that long parching afternoon they had toiled on, with the draught cattle growing more listless, the horses sluggish and restless; and a general feeling of weariness seemed to have seized upon all.  The result was shown in the silence with which they progressed.  The driver and foreloper ceased to shout and crack their whips; the Zulus trudged slowly on behind the waggon; and out of compassion for their horses, Mr Rogers and his sons walked beside the weary beasts.  \"You are sure we shall find water at sundown?\" said Dick to the General.  \"Nothing is sure out in the wilds, young master,\" said the Zulu gravely. \"There should be water there.  If there is not, we must trek on through the night, to the first river or spring.\"  \"But will there be water there?\"  \"We shall be in the game country then, and I can soon find where the game goes to drink, and can lead you there.\"  This was satisfactory, and they trudged on and on, with the land gradually rising, making the pull more heavy for the oxen, whose tongues were lolling out, and whose efforts at last became so painful that Mr Rogers at once accepted his sons' proposal, which was that the horses should help.  A halt was called, and great stones were placed beneath the wheels to make sure that there should be no running backwards on the part of the waggon, and then the tethering ropes were fastened to the horses' saddles; the Zulus and the boys took their head; the word was given to start; the ropes that had been secured to different parts of the waggon tightened; and though the horses could not pull as if they were properly harnessed, the impulse they gave relieved the weary oxen, and after half an hour's toilsome drag, the waggon was drawn to the top of the incline, and the travellers had the pleasure of seeing that a tolerably level way lay before them.  But there was no sign of water, and Mr Rogers looked serious as he swept the dimly seen country before him with his glass.  \"Had we not better outspan here?\" he said, \"and let the oxen rest.  We could start again at daybreak.\"  But the General shook his head.  \"No, boss,\" he replied.  \"Let us go on.  We may find water yet.\"  Mr Rogers gave way, and in a listless, weary fashion the heavy waggon was dragged on.  \"Oh, I am so tired,\" cried Jack; \"and I'd give anything to be able to walk right into a big pond and drink, and soak myself outside.  My skin feels as if it was cracking.\"  \"I'm very tired, too,\" said Dick; \"but not so tired as I thought I should be.  Why I must have walked twenty miles to-day.  I wonder whether that means that I am growing stronger.\"  \"You need not wonder,\" said Mr Rogers, who had heard his words.  \"You may be sure, my boy.  But how dark it is growing!  There are the stars.\"  \"What's the matter with the bullocks?\" cried Jack suddenly.  \"Why, father, they're gone mad with thirst.\"  \"Water,\" cried the General, pointing ahead.  \"They smell the water.\"  The sensitiveness was caught up by the horses, which, like the oxen, quickened their pace, craning with outstretched muzzles, their fine instinct telling them that there was water on ahead, towards which they struggled to get.  Great care was needed now lest the water should prove to be merely a well or pool, into which the bullocks would rush, muddying the water, and perhaps trampling one another to death in their efforts to reach the refreshing liquid.  But strive hard as they would, it proved to be impossible to keep the thirsty creatures back.  The waggon had not proceeded so fast since they started; and the speed was growing greater, causing the great lumbering vehicle to rock and sway in a most alarming fashion.  If they had encountered a rock, however small, there must have been a crash.  But as it happened, they came on very level ground, sloping gently towards the north.  Klipmann, the foremost ox, a great black fellow with long horns, had proclaimed the find, and communicated the fact with a deep-mouthed bellow; and the next minute all was excitement and shouting, as the great waggon thundered and groaned along.  The first thing to be done was to detach the horses, which was no sooner done than they seemed to take fright, and went off at a gallop into the gloom ahead; then, amidst the yells and shoutings of Peter and Dirk, who danced about as if mad, efforts were made to check the oxen; but the poor beasts were frantic with thirst, and any serious attempt to stop them would have meant goring, trampling down, or being crushed by the wheels of the ponderous waggon.  The wild race lasted for a mile, during which every moment threatened to be the waggon's last.  The oxen lowed and trotted on, the waggon creaked, and the loose articles rattled and banged together.  Mr Rogers and his sons panted on at the sides, momentarily expecting to see it go over, and Coffee and Chicory, who had been very slow and silent for hours, whooped and yelled and added to the excitement.  \"It's all over with our trip, Jack,\" panted Dick.  \"We shall have to pick up the pieces to-morrow and go back.\"  \"Wait a bit, and let's see.  Why, what's the General going to do?\"  For all at once the Zulu had darted on ahead after snatching a kiri from Chicory's hand, seized the foremost bullock, old Klipmann, by the horn, and, at the risk of being impaled or trampled down, he beat the stubborn bullock over the head with the club, and treating the other, its yoke-fellow, the same, he forced them into taking a different course, almost at right angles to that which they were pursuing.  \"Stop, stop!\" roared Mr Rogers.  \"You will upset the waggon.\"  But he was too late.  The course of the leading oxen being changed, the others swerved round, giving such a tug at the dissel-boom that the waggon's wreck seemed certain.  The whole team taking, as it did, a different course, the waggon was dragged side-wise, and for a few seconds tottered on its two nearside, or left-hand, wheels.  It seemed as if it must go over crash--that nothing could save it; and Jack uttered a cry of dismay, and warning to his brother to get out of the way.  Then, as if by a miracle, it fell back with a heavy thud on to the other wheels, and bumped and jolted on after the long team of oxen into the obscurity.  And then, when ruin seemed to have come completely upon the expedition, _wish-wash_! _splish-splash_! the foaming of water--the crunching of wheels over stones and sand--a quick rush--and the waggon was standing, axletree deep, in a swiftly flowing river, down whose shelving bank it had been dragged, and in whose cool waters the oxen and horses were washing their legs, and drinking deeply with delight.    CHAPTER NINE.  AN AWFUL FORD TO CROSS.  It was a wonderful relief, and following the example of the animals, every one waded into the cool stream above the oxen, and drank deeply of the delicious water.  \"Oh, I say, father,\" cried Jack, \"I never thought water was so good before.  This _is_ a river.\"  And really Jack had an idea that he had tumbled upon a stream whose waters were wine-like in their flavour; and but for a few words of warning he would have gone on drinking more deeply still.  \"Thank goodness!\" cried Mr Rogers, as soon as he could gain his breath. \"But what an escape!  The waggon nearly went over.  Where is that scoundrel of a Zulu?  Oh there you are,\" he cried excitedly.  \"How dared you touch the oxen, sir!  Your mad folly nearly spoiled our journey.\"  The General looked back at Mr Rogers, drawing himself up in savage pride, and his eyes seemed to flash in the darkness; but he did not speak, only turned away with a dignified look of displeasure.  \"I know why he did it, father,\" cried Dick, excitedly.  \"Look, don't you see?  The ground slopes down here to the water.  Up there it's all rock, and the team would have gone over a precipice.  See, it's twenty feet deep.\"  \"Of course!  To be sure!\" cried Mr Rogers eagerly.  \"His keen sight showed him the danger.  I beg your pardon, my man,\" he cried, \"I did not know the reason, and ought not to have acted and spoken so rashly.\"  He held out his hand to the stern scowling Zulu, as he spoke; but for a moment the savage hot blood that had been roused by his leader's injustice refused to be tamed down, and he remained with his arms folded; but glancing at Dick's eager countenance, and recalling how it was due to him that the real truth of his actions was made known, the General let his better feelings prevail, and snatching Mr Rogers' hand in his, he held it for a moment to his broad breast, and then let it fall.  \"Why you saved the waggon,\" said Mr Rogers, after walking to the edge of the sudden descent where the rock went down sheer to the "]]]
