I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a       grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself       in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. Through this       dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the _Maison de       Santé_ came in view. It was a fantastic château, much       dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and       neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and,       checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however,       grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.        As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and       the visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward,       this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him       cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. It was Monsieur       Maillard himself. He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the       old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity,       dignity, and authority which was very impressive.        My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect       the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance       that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw       him no more.        When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and       exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of       refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical       instruments. A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano,       singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful       woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me       with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low, and her whole manner       subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in       her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not       unpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited       in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and       admiration.        I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard       was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of       soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement       was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched,       were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were       permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary       apparel of persons in right mind.        Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said       before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane;       and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her       eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. I confined my       remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought       would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. She       replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and       even her original observations were marked with the soundest good       sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had       taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I       continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with       which I commenced it.        Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit,       wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon       afterward leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in       an inquiring manner toward my host.        “No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most       accomplished woman.”        “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of       course you will know how to excuse me. The excellent       administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris,       and I thought it just possible, you know—”        “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you       for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find       so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some       unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of       thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. While my former       system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the       privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused       to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to       inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system       of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose       discretion I could not rely.”        “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating       his words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing       system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”        “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded       to renounce it forever.”        “Indeed! you astonish me!”        “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary       to return to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system       was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much       overrated. I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a       fair trial, if ever in any. We did every thing that rational       humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you could not have paid       us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for       yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing       practice—with its details.”        “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth       hand.”        “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which       the patients were _menagés_—humored. We contradicted no fancies       which entered the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only       indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent       cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so       touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad       absurdum. We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves       chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to       accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it       to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week       than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner       a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”        “But was this species of acquiescence all?”        “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind,       such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards,       certain classes of books, and so forth. We affected to treat each       individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder; and the       word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A great point was to set each       lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. To repose       confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to       gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to dispense       with an expensive body of keepers.”        “And you had no punishments of any kind?”        “None.”        “And you never confined your patients?”        “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing       to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to       a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and       there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with       the raging maniac we have nothing to do. He is usually removed to       the public hospitals.”        “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”        “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its       dangers. It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the _Maisons       de Santé_ of France.”        “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I       made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for       mania existed in any portion of the country.”        “You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time       will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is       going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.       Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. Now       about our _Maisons de Santé_, it is clear that some ignoramus has       misled you. After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently       recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take       you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my       opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its       operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”        “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”        “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in       some measure.”        In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or       two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of       the place.        “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To       a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in       such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for       dinner. We will dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult,       with cauliflowers in _velouté_ sauce—after that a glass of Clos       de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”        At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a       large _salle à manger_, where a very numerous company were       assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all. They were, apparently,       people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their       habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking       somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the _vielle       cour_. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2150"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 4 (#8)"],["body","ies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what       a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day. Many       females, for example, whose age could not have been less than       seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings,       bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms       shamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses       were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the       wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to       whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but       my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale,       with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much       too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive       expression. When I had first seen her, she was attired, most       becomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air of oddity, in       short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,       caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,”       and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive       me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable       feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with       lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that       the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people,       with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon       conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions       were immediately and fully dispelled.        The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable       and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about       it. For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a       carpet is frequently dispensed with. The windows, too, were       without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely       fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of       our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I observed, formed, in       itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows were on three       sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. There       were no less than ten windows in all.        The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and       more than loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely       barbaric. There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.       Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an       expenditure of the good things of life. There seemed very little       taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to       quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a       multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were       deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was       possible to find a place. There were several active servants in       attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the       apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes,       trombones, and a drum. These fellows annoyed me very much, at       intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises,       which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much       entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.        Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of       the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up       of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts       of conventional customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be       quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly       at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite,       did justice to the good cheer set before me.        The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The       ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly       all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of       good-humored anecdote in himself. He seemed quite willing to       speak of his position as superintendent of a_Maison de Santé_;       and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a       favorite one with all present. A great many amusing stories were       told, having reference to the _whims_ of the patients.        “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat       at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the       way, is it not especially singular how often this particular       crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely       an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.       Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to       polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”        “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long       ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a       donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite       true. He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep       him within bounds. For a long time he would eat nothing but       thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon       his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking out his       heels—so—so—”        “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here       interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please       keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it       necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?       Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon       my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate       imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”        “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus       addressed—“a thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending.       Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of       taking wine with you.”        Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much       ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.        “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing       myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal _à la St.       Menehoult_—you will find it particularly fine.”        At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in       depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher,       containing what I supposed to be the “_monstrum, horrendum,       informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum_.” A closer scrutiny assured       me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set       upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English       fashion of dressing a hare.        “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not       particularly partial to veal _à la St_.—what is it?—for I do not       find that it altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate,       however, and try some of the rabbit.”        There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what       appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious       morceau, which I can recommend.        “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and       give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”        “This what?” said I.        “This rabbit _au-chat_.”        “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself       to some of the ham.”        There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the       tables of these people of the province. I will have none of their       rabbit _au-chat_—and, for the matter of that, none of their       _cat-au-rabbit_ either.        “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of       the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had       been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a       patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained       himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in       his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the       middle of his leg.”        “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but       not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know,       with the exception of this strange gentleman. I mean the man who       took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with       a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”        Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb       in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the       popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the       tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which       lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of       champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to       Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the       conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.        “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself       for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.       I wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed       myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural       airs that he put on. Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only       observe that it is a pity he was not. His croak       thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B       flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking       a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled       up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus,       why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you       would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”        “I have no"]]]
