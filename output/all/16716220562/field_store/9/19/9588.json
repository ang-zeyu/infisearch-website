He'd have charged a bob a piece for the traps, and landed you up to eight bob, and stood no nonsense too about it.  Come, settle up, young gentlemen, please.  The Templeton boys I'm used to always fork out like gentlemen.\"  Dick took out his purse, and produced five-and-sixpence, which he gave the driver, just as the door opened and the school matron presented herself.  \"Is that your cab?\" said she, pointing to the receding hansom.  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \"How much did he charge you?\"  \"Five shillings, ma'am.\"  The lady uttered an exclamation of mingled wrath and contempt.  \"It's double his right fare.  Run quick, and you'll catch him.\"  Heathcote started to run, shouting meekly, and waving his hand to the man to stop.  But the man good-humouredly declined the invitation, raising his hat gallantly to the lady, and putting his tongue into his cheek, as he touched the horse up into a trot, and rattled out of the square.  Heathcote returned rather sheepishly, and the two friends followed the lady indoors feeling that their entry into Templeton had been anything but triumphant.  \"The idea!\" said the matron, partly to herself and partly to the boys, \"of his landing you and all your luggage on the pavement like that, and then going off, before I came.  He knew well enough I should have seen he only got his right fare.  The wretch!\"  The boys did not know at the time, but they discovered it afterwards, that Mrs Partlett, the matron, had a standing feud with all the cabmen of Templeton, whose delight it was to enjoy themselves at her expense--a pastime they could not more effectively achieve than by fleecing her young charges, so to speak, under her very nose.  \"Now,\" said she, when presently she had recovered her equanimity, \"if you'll unlock these things, you can go and take a walk round the Quadrangle and look about you, while I unpack.  The bell will ring for new boys' tea in half an hour.\"  They obeyed, and took a melancholy, but interested stroll round the great court.  They read all the Latin mottoes, and were horrified to find one or two which they could not translate.  Fancy a Templeton boy not being able to understand his own mottoes!  They read the names on the different masters' doors; and dwelt with special reverence on the door-plate of Mr Westover, in whose house they were to reside.  They deciphered the carvings on the great gate, and shuddered as they saw the name of one \"Joe Bolt\" cut rude and deep across the forehead of the cherub who stood sentinel at the chapel portal.  All was wonder in that strange walk.  The wonder of untasted proprietorship.  It was _their_ school, _their_ quadrangle, _their_ chapel, _their_ elm-trees; and yet they scarcely liked to inspect them too closely, or behave themselves towards them too familiarly.  One or two boys were taking solitary strolls, like themselves.  They were new boys too--nearly all of them afflicted with the same uneasiness, some more, some less.  It was amusing to see the way these new boys held themselves one to another as they crossed and passed one another in that afternoon's promenade.  There was no falling into one another's arms in bursts of mutual sympathy.  There was no forced gaiety and indifference, as though one would say \"I don't think much of the place after all.\"  No.  With blunt English pride, each boy bridled up a bit as a stranger drew near, and looked straight in front of him, till the coast was clear.  At length the bell above the matron's door began to toll, and there was a general movement among the stragglers in its direction.  About twenty boys, mostly of our heroes' age, assembled in the tea room. Their small band looked almost lost in that great hall, as they clustered, of one accord, for warmth and comfort, at one end of the long table.  The matron entered and said grace, and then proceeded to pour out tea for her hungry family, while the boys themselves, at her injunction, passed round the bread-and-butter and eggs.  A meal is one of the most civilising institutions going; and Dick, after two cups of Templeton tea, and several cubic inches of Templeton bread- and-butter, felt amiably inclined towards his left-hand neighbour, a little timorous-looking boy, who blushed when anybody looked at him, and nearly fainted when he heard his own voice answering Mrs Partlett's enquiry whether he wanted another cup.  Apart from a friendly motive, it seemed to Dick it would be good practice to begin talking to a youth of this unalarming aspect.  He therefore enquired, \"Are you a new boy?\"  The boy started to hear himself addressed; then looking shyly up in the speaker's face, and divining that no mischief lurked there, he replied--  \"Yes.\"  Dick took another gulp of tea, and continued, \"Where do you live--in London?\"  \"No--I live in Devonshire.\"  Dick returned to his meal again, and exchanged some sentences with Heathcote before he resumed.  \"What school were you at before?\"  \"I wasn't at any--I had lessons at home.\"  \"A tutor?\"  The boy blushed very much, and looked appealingly at Dick, as though to beg him to receive the disclosure he was about to make kindly.  \"No--my mother taught me.\"  Dick did receive it kindly.  That is, he didn't laugh.  He felt sorry for the boy and what was in store for him when the news got abroad.  He also felt much less reserved in continuing the conversation.  \"Heathcote here and I were at Mountjoy; so we're pretty well used to kicking about,\" said he, patronisingly.  \"I suppose you didn't go in for the entrance exam, then?\"  \"Yes, I did,\" said the boy.  \"Poor chap,\" thought Dick, \"fancy a fellow who's never left his mammy's apron-strings going in for an exam.  How did you get on?\" he added, turning to his companion.  \"Pretty well, I think,\" said the boy shyly.  \"I was twenty-first out of thirty-six,\" said Dick, \"and Heathcote here was fifteenth--where were you?\"  Again the boy made a mute appeal for toleration, as he replied, \"I was first.\"  Dick put down his cup, and stared at him.  \"Go on!\" said he.  \"It was down on the list so,\" said the boy with an apologetic air. \"They sent one with the names printed.\"  Dick made a desperate onslaught on the bread-and-butter, regarding his neighbour out of the corners of his eyes from time to time, quite at a loss to make him out.  \"How old are you?\" he demanded presently.  \"Thirteen.\"  \"What's your name?\"  \"Bertie Aspinall.\"  \"Whose house are you going to live in?\"  \"Mr Westover's.\"  \"Oh!\" said Dick, abruptly ending the conversation, and turning round towards Heathcote.  In due time the meal was over, and the boys were told they could do as they liked for the next hour, until the matron was at leisure to show them their quarters.  So for another hour the promenade in the Quadrangle was resumed.  Not so dismally, however, as before.  The tea had broken the ice wonderfully, and instead of the studied avoidance of the afternoon, one group and another fell now to comparing notes, and rehearsing the legends they had heard of Templeton and its inmates.  And gradually a fellow-feeling made every one wondrous kind, and the little army of twenty in the prospect of to-morrow's battles, drew together in bonds of self-defence, and felt all very like brothers.  Aspinall, however, who knew no one, and had not dared to join himself to any of the groups, paced in solitude at a distance, hoping for nothing better than that he might escape notice and be left to himself.  But Dick, whose interest in him had become very decided, found him out before long and, much to his terror, insisted in introducing him to Heathcote and attaching him to their party.  \"There's nothing to be in a funk about, young 'un,\" said he.  \"I know I don't mean to funk it, whatever they do to me.\"  \"I'll back you up, old man, all I can,\" said Heathcote.  \"I expect it's far the best way not to kick out, but just go through with it,\" said Dick.  \"That's what my father says, and he had a pretty rough time of it, he said, at first.\"  \"Oh, _yes_; I'm sure it's all the worse for a fellow if he funks or gets out of temper.\"  All this was very alarming talk for the timorous small boy to overhear, and he longed, a hundred times, to be safe back in Devonshire.  \"I'm afraid,\" he faltered.  \"I know--I shall be a coward.\"  \"Don't be a young ass,\" said Dick.  \"Heathcote and I will back you up all we can, won't we, Georgie?\"  \"Rather,\" said Heathcote.  \"If you do, it won't be half so bad,\" said the boy, brightening up a bit; \"it's dreadful to be a coward.\"  \"Well, why are you one?\" said Dick.  \"No one's obliged to be one.\"  \"I suppose I can't help it.  I try hard.\"  \"There goes the bell.  I suppose that's for us to go in,\" said Dick, as the summons once more sounded.  They found the matron with a list in her hand, which she proceeded to call over, bidding each boy answer to his name.  The first twelve were the new boys of Westover's house, and they included our two heroes and Aspinall, who were forthwith marched, together with their night apparel, across the court to their new quarters.  Here they were received by another matron, who presided over the wardrobes of the youth of Westover's, and by her they were escorted to one of the dormitories, where, for that night at any rate, they were to be permitted to sleep in the comfort of one another's society.  \"New boys are to call on the Doctor after breakfast in the morning,\" announced she.  \"Breakfast at eight, and no morning chapel.  Good- night!\"  It was not long before the dormitory was silent.  One by one, the tired boys dropped off, most of them with heavy hearts as they thought of the morrow.  Among the last was Dick, who, as he lay awake and went over, in his mind, the experiences of the day, was startled by what sounded very like a sob in the bed next to his.  He had half a mind to get up and go and say something to the dismal little Devonshire boy.  But on second thoughts he thought the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20991"],["title","Follow My Leader: The Boys of Templeton (#6)"],["body","thing would be to let the poor fellow have his cry out, so he turned over and tried not to hear it; and while trying he fell asleep.    CHAPTER FOUR.  HOW OUR HEROES ARE PUT THROUGH THEIR PACES.  \"The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold\" early next day.  The twenty innocent lambs whom, in the last chapter, we left sweetly folded in slumber had barely had time to arise and comb their hair when the advance-guard of the hungry tyrant appeared in their midst.  This was no other than a truck-load of trunks, portmanteaux, bags and hat-boxes sent up from the station, the owners of which, so the alarming rumour spread, were on the road.  It was an agitated meal our heroes partook of with the spectacle of that truck before their eyes, and many an anxious ear was pricked for the first sound of the approaching horde.  But the horde, being aware that nothing was expected of it till mid-day, by no means saw the fun of surrendering its liberty at 10 o'clock, and went down to bathe in the harbour on the way up, so that the fate which impended was kept for two good hours in suspense.  Meanwhile, the interview with the Doctor was accomplished.  It was not very alarming.  Your new boy would sooner face twenty doctors than one hero of the middle Fifth.  The head master asked a few kindly questions of each boy, and, so to speak, took stock of him before adding his name formally to the school list.  He also added a few words of advice to the company generally, and enlightened them as to a few of the chief school rules.  The others, he said, they would learn soon enough.  Whereat they all said, \"Thank you, sir,\" and retired.  Dick and Heathcote, with young Aspinall in tow, walked back to Westover's house together, and were nearly half-way there, when Aspinall suddenly clutched Dick's arm and whispered--  \"There's one!\"  They all stood still and gazed as if it was a spectre, not a human being, they expected.  What they really did see was a rather nice-looking boy of sixteen or seventeen lounging in at the great gateway, looking about him with a familiar air, and apparently bending his steps straight for Westover's.  It was an awkward situation for our three new boys.  Every step brought them nearer under the observation of the \"Assyrian,\" and at every step they felt more awkward and abashed.  Dick did his best to put on a little swagger.  He stuck one hand in his pocket, and twitched his hat a trifle on one side.  Heathcote, too, instinctively let slip his jacket button so as to betray his watch- chain, and laughed rather loudly at something which nobody said.  Poor young Aspinall attempted no such demonstration, but slipped under the lee of his protectors, and wondered what would become of him.  The old boy and the new foregathered just at the door of Westover's, and it was not till they actually stood face to face that the former gave any sign of being aware of the presence of the trio.  He then honoured them with a casual survey as they stood back to let him enter first.  \"New kids?\" he asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Westover's?\"  \"Yes.\"  The hero grunted and passed in, and they heard him shouting to the matron to ask if his traps had come from the station, and whether anybody had come yet.  Anybody come!  He didn't count them, that was plain.  Not knowing exactly what to do, they determined on another walk round the Quad, preferring to be reconnoitred by the enemy in the open, and not indoors--possibly in a corner.  The enemy reconnoitred in force.  After the first arrival, boys dropped in in twos and threes, in cabs, in omnibuses, in high spirits, in low spirits.  The old square began to get lively.  The echoes which had slept soundly for the past fortnight woke up suddenly, and the rooks in the elms began to grow uneasy, and summoned a cabinet council to discuss what was going on in the lower world.  \"Hallo, Duff, old man,\" cried one boy near to our heroes, as he caught sight of a chum across the square.  \"Seen Raggles?\"  \"Yes; he's got a cargo down.  He's asked me.\"  \"Tell him I'm up, will you?\"  \"What's a cargo?\" asked Heathcote, as the speaker went past.  \"Goodness knows,\" said Dick--\"perhaps it's a crib.\"  \"My brother Will used to call a hamper a cargo,\" said Aspinall.  \"Humph,\" said Dick, who never liked to be corrected, \"there's something in that.\"  \"I hope there is,\" said Heathcote.  It said a great deal for the solemnity of the occasion that Dick did not at once proceed to administer condign punishment.  He took note of the offence, though, and punished the offender quietly in bed some days after.  Just at the present moment, had he been inclined to square accounts, he had no leisure; for a sudden cry of \"Dredger!\" was raised, whereat they noticed a number of boys step off the pavement on to the grass.  Before they could conjecture what this sudden manoeuvre might mean, a rush of steps arose behind, and next moment they were caught up in the toils of a net constructed of towels knotted together, stretching across the path, and held at each end by two swift runners who swept them along at a headlong pace, catching up a shoal of stray fish on the way until even the stalwart dredgers were compelled, from the very weight of their \"take,\" to slacken speed.  A crowd collected to witness the emptying of the net.  One by one the trembling small fry were grabbed and passed round to answer a string of questions such as--  \"What's your name?\"  \"Are you most like your father or your mother?\"  \"Who's your hatter?\"  \"Can you swim?\"  \"Who was the father of Zebedee's children?\"  \"Are you a Radical or a Tory?\"  All of which questions each luckless catechumen was required to answer truly, and in a loud, distinct voice, amid the most embarrassing cheers and jeers and hootings of the audience.  Dick got through his fairly well till he came to the political question, when he made the great mistake of saying he didn't know whether he was a Radical or a Tory.  For, as he might have expected, every one was down on him, and he was sent forth a marked man to make up his mind on the question.  Heathcote, whose sorrow it was to be separated from his friend in the landing of the catch, was less lucky.  He professed himself like his mother, which was greatly against him.  His hatter also was a country artist instead of a Londoner, and that he discovered was an extremely grave offence.  And as for his politics, he made a greater mistake even than Dick, for he professed himself imbued with opinions \"between the two,\" an announcement which brought down a torrent of abuse and scorn, mingled with cries of \"kick him for a half-and-half prig!\" an observation which Heathcote was very sorry indeed to hear.  As the reader may guess, poor young Aspinall had a very bad time of it. He began to cry as soon as the first question was propounded.  But this demonstration failed to shelter him.  A general hiss greeted the sound of his whimper, and cries of, \"Where's his bottle?\"  \"Meow!\"  \"Hush-a-bye baby!\"  His ruthless tyrants, who knew no distinction between the tears of a crocodile and the tears of a terrified child, made him go through his catechism to the bitter end.  They howled with delight when they heard him call himself Bertie, and paused in dead silence to hear him say whether he was like \"papa or mamma\"--\"or nurse?\" as some one suggested.  He took refuge in tears again, with the result that his inquisitors were more than ever determined to get their answer.  \"Hang it, you young ass,\" said one boy, whom the child, even in his flutter and misery, recognised as the boy who had accosted them at the door of Westover's that morning, \"can't you answer without blubbering like that?  Nobody's going to eat you up.\"  This friendly admonition served to set the boy on his feet, and he stammered out, \"Mother.\"  \"You weren't asked if you were like your mother,\" shouted some one, \"are you most like 'papa or mamma?'\"  \"Mamma,\" faltered the boy.  Whereat there was great jubilation, as there was also when he described his hatter as _Mr_.  Smith of Totnes.  \"Can you swim?\"  \"N-no, I'm afraid not.\"  \"That's a pity, with the lot you blubber.  You'll get drowned some day.\"  Terrific cheers greeted this sally, in the midst of which the boy was almost forgotten.  But the political test remained.  \"Now, Bertie dear, are you a Radical or a Tory?\" he was asked.  The boy took a deep breath, and said--  \"I'm a Radical.\"  At which straightforward and unlooked-for reply there were great cheers and counter-cheers, in the midst of which the scared little Radical was hustled down from his perch and sent flying to join his friends, and calm the fluttering of his poor little heart.  It being evidently unsafe to remain longer in the Quadrangle, the dejected trio betook themselves with many misgivings, to their house.  Westover's presented a striking contrast to the quiet scene of yesterday evening.  It being still a quarter to twelve, and term not being supposed to commence till mid-day, the short interval of freedom from school rules was being made use of to the best advantage.  The matron, shouted at and besieged on all sides, already stood at bay, with her hands to her ears, having abandoned any attempt to do anything for anybody.  The house porter was in a similar condition of strike.  He had once been knocked completely over by rival claimants on his assistance, and he had several times been nearly pulled limb from limb by disappointed employers.  He, therefore, stood with his back to the wall and his arms folded, waiting till the storm should blow itself out.  Upstairs, in the studies, riot scarcely less exuberant was taking place. Bosom friends, reunited after three weeks' separation, celebrated their reunion with paeans of jubilation and war-whoops of triumph.  \"Cargoes\" were being unladen here; Liddell-and-Scott was officiating as a cricket ball there; a siege was going on round this door, and a hand-to-hand scrimmage between the posts of that.  A few of the placid ones were quietly"]]]
