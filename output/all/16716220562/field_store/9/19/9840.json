O Val!\" he cried in a choking voice, and then he dropped back, poor boy, for he could say no more.  \"Be sharp there and get it done, me bhoy,\" said the captain.  \"Ye can say good-bye to the owld woman; but lave the cat and the dogs till ye come back.\"  \"Are you going to march at once?\" said my father as Aunt Jenny came to my side, and I gripped my saddle and bent down for her to put her arms round my neck.  \"Sor, ye see that I am,\" said the captain.  \"But you and your men will take something to eat and drink?\"  \"Something to send them asleep?\" said the captain suspiciously.  \"I'm thinkin' they can last till we get back to Drak Pass, where there's a shtore.  I'm obleeged to ye all the same.--There, that'll do, owld lady. I'll make a man of the bhoy, and send him back safe and sound, if some of the raw recruits of the brutal Saxons don't shoot him.\"  \"Good-bye, then.  God bless you and protect you, Val!\" said Aunt Jenny, with a sob, as she loosened her grip of my neck, and I straightened myself up, feeling my heart swell and the blood bound in my veins, for while my father kept the captain in converse, she, with quivering lips, had breathed words of hope into my ear.  \"Listen, Val,\" she said.  \"Your father bids me say that you are to watch for your chance, and then make a dash for your liberty.  Gallop to Echo Nek, and you will find Joeboy waiting there with a rifle and cartridges. But you must not come back here.  Joeboy will bring a letter.\"  My heart was bounding with hope, and I felt ready for anything just then, as the captain gave the orders \"Mount!\" and then \"Forward!\"  But the next minute my spirits sank into the darkness of misery.  For what had Aunt Jenny said?  Joeboy would be waiting at Echo Nek with a rifle and cartridges.  Yes; but poor Joeboy had taken flight at the appearance of the Boers, and fled for his liberty, in the belief that they had come for him.    CHAPTER FOUR.  WAITING FOR MY CHANCE.  I rode on painfully as regarded my wrists; for above them my arms throbbed and burned as if the veins were distended almost to bursting-point, while my hands grew gradually cold and numb, and then became insensible as so much lead.  The physical pain, however, was nothing to what I felt mentally.  Only an hour or two before I was leading that calm, happy home-life, without a trouble beyond some petty disappointment in the garden or farm or during one of the hunting or shooting expeditions with Joeboy to carry my game; and now a lightning-like stroke seemed to have descended to end my idyllic boy-life and make me a man full of suffering, and with a future which I abhorred.  \"No,\" I argued, \"I must escape, even if they do send a shower of bullets to bring me down.\"  I did not believe much in the vaunted powers of the Boers with the rifle.  I knew that they could shoot well, but no better than my father and his two pupils, meaning Bob and myself; and I felt that we should have been very doubtful about bringing down a man going at full gallop, even in the brightest daylight; and I meant to make my venture in the dusk of the evening or after dark if only my captors would continue their journey then.  Once well started, and my rein free of the man who held it buckled to his saddle-bow, I had no fear at all, for I was sure that in a straight race there was not a Boer amongst them who could overtake me, they being heavy, middle-aged men, while I was young and light, quite at home in the saddle, and Sandho as much at home with me, upon his back.  Arms?  I could do without them.  Reins?  I needed none, if only free of the one which held me to my left-hand guard; for an extra pressure of either leg would send my beautiful little Australian horse in the direction I wished to turn, while a word of encouragement would send him on like the wind, and an order sharply uttered check him even if at full speed.  I had had Sandho four years, mounting him as soon as he was strong enough to bear me, and ever since we seemed to have been companions more than master and servant.  We had played together; I had hunted him, and he had hunted me--finding me, too, when I hid from him; and he answered when out grazing on the veldt with a cheery neigh before galloping to meet me.  Why, there had been times when we had both lain down to sleep together on the distant plains, my head resting on his glossy neck; so, now that he was bearing me along, comparatively helpless, and I felt his elastic, springy form beneath me, I was ashamed of my despair, convinced that if I gave the word he would snap that rein at the first bound, and bear me safely away.  I made up my mind that if I could defer my attempt till it was dark I should be safe.  If, however, I were obliged to venture in daylight, I would make my dash by some rocky pass or kopje on the way, where Sandho would easily leave the Boers' horses behind, he being almost as sure-footed as a goat.  The captain drew rein a little, so that I came alongside during the first part of our ride, and he cast his eye over my bonds and gave the Boer who had the leading-rein a sharp order or two about keeping a good lookout.  To this the dull, heavy fellow responded with a surly growl. After this the Irishman banteringly asked me if I was comfortable.  My answer was an angry glare--at least, I meant it to be--but the only effect was to make him laugh.  \"Ye've got a bad seat in the saddle, and it will be a good lesson to ye in riding, bhoy.  Make ye sit up.  I hate to see a military man with his showlders up and his nose down close to his charrger's mane.  Faith, I'm half-disposed to make ye throw the stirrups over the nag's neck, and I would if we'd toime.  But we've none to spare for picking ye up when ye came off.--Here,\" he cried to the two men next behind, for we now rode two and two; \"why are your carbines not full-cocked--rifles, I mane? That's right.  Fire at wanst if he tries to bowlt; don't wait for ordhers.\"  I listened to the sharp clicking of the rifle-locks as the men cocked their pieces; but somehow I did not feel scared, for a feeling of desperation was upon me, and I was strung-up to dare anything to get my liberty; and, besides, my father's orders were that I should make a dash.  \"They can't hit me,\" I said to myself; and wherever the track was fair going we went on at a canter, drawing rein wherever the ground grew bad. At these latter times the captain began talking loudly in a highly-pitched and half-contemptuous way to the leading men; and when his words reached my ears I made out that his subject was either about military evolutions and a man's bearing in the saddle, or else, in a harsh and bitter tone, about the brutal Saxon who was at last going to receive his dues for his long years of evil-doing and tyranny towards the oppressed.  Hearing such talk, I rode on half-wondering what England had been doing towards the Irish at home and the Boers abroad, for this was all news to me, and I had never noticed among the Dutch settlers on the veldt anything but a stolid kind of contentment with their prosperous lot; there not being a single case of poverty, as far as I knew, within a hundred miles of our pleasant home.  At the thought of home a strange swelling came in my throat, and the wide, open veldt before me looked dim as I pictured all I had left behind; for, happy as had been the life I led, and lovely as everything around had always seemed, home had never seemed so beautiful as now. However, I set my teeth hard, knit my brows, and with an effort seemed to swallow down that swelling lump in my throat, at the same time nipping Sandho's sides so sharply that he gathered himself up to bound off; but he was checked by a savage snatch at the rein, and received a blow with the barrel of my escort's rifle, as the surly and scowling brute beside me growled out a fierce oath in Dutch.  The plunge Sandho gave nearly unseated me, and in another moment he would have been rearing and kicking to get free; but a few gentle words from my lips soothed the poor beast down, and he settled into his canter once more, while I fell to wondering whether my poor horse could think and would understand that the brutal treatment did not come from his master.  On and on we rode over ground familiar to me, for many a long journey from home had I been in every direction--hunting, shooting, or with our wagon and oxen and Joeboy as foreloper, on journeys of many days through the wilderness, to fetch stores for home use or to dispose of game or stock.  So beautiful it all seemed; now it was so wretched for me to leave it all, and to be forced to go and fight against my brothers, so to speak, in a cause that I felt I must hate.  As I rode on, thinking thus, I could see that there was no such oppression and tyranny as the Irish captain spoke of; nothing but a bitter and contemptible race-hatred, fostered by idle and discontented men.  \"But I shan't have to fight,\" I said to myself.  \"They talk about freedom, and drag me away as a slave; but I too mean to be free.\"  From that moment the gloomy lookout ahead seemed to pass away, the veldt seeming glorious in the afternoon sunshine; and, cantering through the invigorating air, I could have enjoyed my ride but for the constrained position in which I sat, and the dull pain in my arms and shoulders.  I tried to forget this, and listened to the captain's words, for he grew more and more loquacious.  I gathered that he reckoned upon picking up other two young fellows of my own stamp at the farm twenty miles from ours; and I noted that, no matter what he said, his words were listened to in gloomy silence or received with grunting monosyllables, while the Boers talked among themselves only about home and farming work or the sale of stock.  More than once, too, I heard one of the men near me wonder how the housewife would be getting on with the beasts and sheep. The words were spoken in Boer Dutch;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21302"],["title","Charge! A Story of Briton and Boer (#4)"],["body"," in the course of years I had become pretty well acquainted with the expressions of ordinary life. Thus it seemed as if the men were anything but contented followers of their noisy, vapouring leader.  At last the farm was reached, and we halted for refreshment, spending about half-an-hour to water and feed the horses, during which time I was carefully guarded.  There was no opposition here.  The two recruits to the commando, as they termed it, had been duly served with notice, and within the time named they were ready with their horses, and armed; but when we made our start I could see with what surly unwillingness they took their places in the rank, and noticed too that they were nearly as strictly watched as I was.  In fact, I saw them exchange glances after receiving a bullying order from Moriarty, and felt that it would not have taken much to cause a display of temper on the part of the recruits.  That, however, by the way: my thoughts were too much taken up with my own position to pay much heed to the two young Boers; for when we were once more on our route for our next stopping-place, where we were to halt for the night, I felt that the time was rapidly approaching when I must make my escape.  I did not say to myself _try_ to make my escape, but to make it; for I had no fear of being unsuccessful.  The night was coming on fast, and I knew that there was no moon, which was all in my favour; and, once free, all I had to do was to make straight for home--a ride of perhaps thirty miles through the wild country, keeping away from the track, and with nothing to fear.  Yes, there wore the lions, plentiful enough in the wilder parts; but the thought of them did not damp me, for Sandho would soon give me warning if any were near, and carry me well out of danger.  Then there was the next day.  I was to make for Echo Nek, and there, meet Joeboy, who would bear my father's instructions; but would Joeboy be there?  My heart sank a little at the thought of how doubtful this was; but I soon cheered up again.  At the worst it meant waiting a day or two, for I should not venture, home.  The Boers would ride back--of that I felt sure; then, thinking I should certainly seek for refuge with my people, they would scour the country in search of me, and they might search Echo Nek, though it was ten miles away.  \"Never mind,\" I said to myself cheerily enough; \"that all belongs to what _may be_: let's think only of _will be_;\" and I rode on, scanning the track and keeping a good lookout from side to side for the likeliest spot for my attempt.  I was still keenly watching when the shades of evening darkened into night, and the right place had not yet come; there were even moments when doubts began to creep in, for my arms grew acutely painful, and this thought worried me terribly: \"Helpless as I am now, and growing weary, shall I have the strength to carry out my plan?\" I still had strength enough to drive out the doubting thought, and forced myself into watching eagerly for my chance, having pretty well determined what I would do first, trusting to the sudden surprise to give me a few moments' start.  In vain I looked for such a sanctuary as a rocky pile of scattered granite would afford, for it had at last grown dark--a clear, semi-transparent darkness, through which I could see twenty or thirty yards in any direction; beyond that distance everything rapidly grew black.  If I could at once get fifty yards away, there was apparently clear galloping ground, and distance would at any moment furnish me with a dark hiding-place.  All I wanted was the start; but how to get it?  I had my big knife in my pocket; but I might as well have been without it, fastened as I was.  So, though I thought and thought, I could see no way of dividing that rein; the idea of raising it to my teeth being dismissed as an impossibility, as also of Sandho cutting it with his own powerful nip, for I knew the idea of communicating my desire to the horse was absurd.  \"How to manage?  How to manage?\"  I kept on saying to myself.  The idea would not come; and as it grew darker our canter gave place to a round trot, and soon after we steadied down to a walk.  Suppose I suddenly made Sandho rear up?  That would be easy, for I could make him rise on his hind-legs and fight with his fore.  But what good would that do?  No more than making him kick violently in all directions, as he turned his fore-feet into a pivot upon which he turned, bringing his heels round to all points of the compass, and delivering smashing blows with them.  Splendid practice this when a litter of half-grown lions were trying to pull him down, but now not likely to do more than bring down punishment upon the poor beast.  Again and again I made up my mind to make him give a sudden bound; but the chances were that it would not snap the rein, only cruelly drag the poor fellow's mouth.  And the minutes glided by, and the position grew more and more hopeless.  Then, suddenly, I seemed to see the only possible way of getting clear.  We rode with long reins, my father and I, and I began to wonder why I had not thought of putting my plan in action before.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A DASH FOR LIBERTY.  As I have said, one of my reins was unbuckled, passed over the horse's neck, and buckled to the Boer's saddle-bow; and in consequence of the length of the strap, it hung down in a long curve when we were riding a fair distance apart, so I felt I had only to press my horse close alongside that of my companion to slacken the leather strap still further.  My plan was almost a forlorn hope; but I could think of no other, and determined to try it, even if, as would probably be the case, it meant no more than dragging me suddenly from the saddle, to fall and be trampled among the horses' heels.  Still, I was determined, and only waited now for the thrilling moment when I would try.  We rode on for what seemed to me another mile, and still one moment seemed as good as another.  I was ready to despair.  Then the time came. The Boer at my side, having slung his cocked rifle over his shoulder, fumbled in the darkness for something.  Guessing what my companion was about to do, with a slight pressure of my right leg I made Sandho edge gradually closer.  I was quite right.  He took out a big Dutch pipe and a pouch, proceeding to fill the bowl and press down the tobacco; and as he worked so did I.  Edging Sandho nearer and nearer, with my heart beginning to beat with big, heavy throbs, I withdrew my left foot from the stirrup, lowered it down in front of the loosely-hanging rein, and, as soon as that was level with my ankle, twisted my foot again and again, till the rein was three times round.  Then I felt the drag upon the Boer's saddle-bow, just as the man was getting a light; and at that moment my leg came in contact with his so suddenly that it jerked him, and the match he had struck went out.  \"Thunder and lightning!\" he growled, kicking out to drive Sandho farther away, but missing him, for I had just thrust my toe back into the stirrup-iron and was pressing my horse away.  The next minute scratch went another match, the bright light shining out for a moment between us so that I could see the man's face plainly as he held the burning splint between his hands on a level with his chin. Then it was out again, for with a loud, shrill cry I was urging Sandho to make his great effort--one which, as I have said, meant either freedom--if the escape of one bound as I was could be so regarded--or the horse galloping away and leaving me to be trampled under foot.  \"_Ri_--_ri_--_ri_--_ri_--_ri_--_ri_!\"  I half-shrieked, and Sandho made a tremendous bound.  There was a jerk at my left leg which nearly dragged me from the saddle, and then we were off and away, the horse tearing over the level plain out into the darkness; while close behind, after a momentary pause, I heard the trampling of horses and the high-pitched voice of the Irish leader yelling out orders.  Then flash after flash cut the darkness, and _crack, crack, crack_ came the reports of the rifles, as the men fired in what they believed to be my direction; but I heard no whistling bullet, and the firing ceased as quickly as it had begun, for there was the risk of my pursuers inflicting injury upon their fellows who led, and whom I could hear thundering along behind me, while with voice and knee I urged Sandho on at his greatest speed.  A wild feeling of elation sent the blood dancing through my veins as we raced along, and I was ready to burst out into shout after shout of triumph, for I was free! free!  And away we went, I almost perfectly helpless, and knowing I must trust to my brave horse to carry me beyond the reach of pursuit.  _Throb, throb, throb_ went his hoofs on the soft earth, and _throb, throb, throb_ went my heart, during what seemed now like some wild, feverish dream in which I was careering onward through the semi-transparent darkness, fully expecting every moment to see some great patch of brush or pile of loose granite loom up before us, to be followed by a tremendous leap, a crash as we came to horrible grief, and then insensibility; but nothing of the kind occurred, for I had chosen the happiest moment for my attempt, and we were galloping over the almost level veldt.  But evidently guided by the beat of my horse's hoofs, the Boers were still in full chase, the deep thudding of their troopers sounding loud and clear.  For a few minutes, in the wild excitement, I could think of nothing but whispering words of encouragement to Sandho, as I lay right forward now and pressed and caressed him with my legs; while, as I reached towards his head, I could just make out the delicate ears, and see them laid back to listen to my words every time I spoke.  Then a strange pain brought me more consciousness of my position.  It was not the aching above my crippled wrists, but in my left leg, which felt strained and stretched as if on the rack, and for a few"]]]
