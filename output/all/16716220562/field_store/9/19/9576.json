When we returned to Earth, they would insist we had only been gone one day, the time we spent out of the drive. See?\"  \"I catch,\" said Fuller. \"By the way, shouldn't we take some photographs of this system? Otherwise, Earth won't get the news for several years yet.\"  \"Right,\" agreed Morey. \"And we might as well look for the other planets of the Black Star, too.\"  They made several plates, continuing their observations until all the planets had been located, even old Pluto, where crews of Nigran technicians were obviously at work, building giant structures of lux metal. The great cities of the Nigrans were beginning to bloom on the once bleak plains of the planet. The mighty blaze of Sirius had warmed Pluto, vaporizing its atmosphere and thawing its seas. The planet that the Black Star had stolen from the Solar System was warmer than it had been for two billion years.  \"Well, that's it,\" said Arcot when they had finished taking the necessary photographs. \"We can prove we went faster than light easily, now. The astronomers can take up the work of classifying the planets and getting details of the orbits when we get back.  \"Since the Nigrans now have a sun of their own, there should be no reason for hostility between our race and theirs. Perhaps we can start commercial trade with them. Imagine! Commerce over quintillions of miles of space!\"  \"And,\" interrupted Wade, \"they can make the trip to this system in less time than it takes to get to Venus!\"  \"Meanwhile,\" said Morey, \"let's get on with our own exploration.\"  They strapped themselves into the control seats once more and Arcot threw in the molecular drive to take them away from the sun toward which they had been falling.  When the great, hot disc of Sirius had once more diminished to a tiny white pinhead of light, Arcot turned the ship until old Sol once more showed plainly on the cross-hairs of the aiming telescope in the rear of the vessel.  \"Hold on,\" Arcot cautioned, \"here we go again!\"  Again he threw the little red tumbler that threw a flood of energy into the coils. The space about them seemed to shiver and grow dim.  Arcot had thrown more power into the coils this time, so the stars ahead of them instead of appearing violet were almost invisible; they were radiating in the ultra-violet now. And the stars behind them, instead of appearing to be green, had subsided to a dull red glow.  Arcot watched the dull red spark of Sirius become increasingly dimmer. Then, quite suddenly, a pale violet disc in front of them ballooned out of nowhere and slid off to one side.  The spaceship reeled, perking the men around in the control seats. Heavy safety relays thudded dully; the instruments flickered under a suddenly rising surge of power--then they were calm again. Arcot had snapped over the power switch.  \"That,\" he said quietly, \"is not so good.\"  \"Threw the gyroscopes, didn't it?\" asked Morey, his voice equally as quiet.  \"It did--and I have no idea how far. We're off course and we don't know which direction we're headed.\"     VI   \"What's the matter?\" asked Fuller anxiously.  Arcot pointed out the window at a red star that blazed in the distance. \"We got too near the field of gravity of that young giant and he threw us for a loss. We drained out three-fourths of the energy from our coils and lost our bearings in the bargain. The attraction turned the gyroscopes and threw the ship out of line, so we no longer know where the sun is.  \"Well, come on, Morey; all we can do is start a search. At this distance, we'd best go by Sirius; it's brighter and nearer.\" He looked at the instrument panel. \"I was using the next lowest power and I still couldn't avoid that monster. This ship is just a little _too_ hot to handle.\"  Their position was anything but pleasant. They must pick out from the vast star field behind them the one star that was home, not knowing exactly where it was. But they had one tremendous help--the photographs of the star field around Sol that they had taken at the last stop. All they had to do was search for an area that matched their photographs.  They found the sun at last, after they had spotted Sirius, but they had had to rotate the ship through nearly twenty-five degrees to do it. After establishing their bearings, they took new photographs for their files.  Meanwhile, Wade had been recharging the coils. When he was finished, he reported the fact to Arcot.  \"Fine,\" Arcot said. \"And from now on, I'm going to use the least possible amount of power. It certainly isn't safe to use more.\"  They started for the control room, much relieved. Arcot dived first, with Wade directly behind him. Wade decided suddenly to go into his room and stopped himself by grabbing a handhold. Morey, following close behind, bumped into him and was brought to rest, while Wade was pushed into his room.  But Fuller, coming last, slammed into Morey, who moved forward with new velocity toward the control room, leaving Fuller hanging at rest in the middle of the corridor.  \"Hey, Morey!\" he laughed. \"Send me a skyhook! I'm caught!\" Isolated as he was in the middle of the corridor, he couldn't push on anything and remained stranded.  \"Go to sleep!\" advised Morey. \"It's the most comfortable bed you'll find!\"  Wade looked out of his room just then. \"Well, if it isn't old Weakmuscles Fuller! Weighs absolutely nothing and is still so weak he can't push himself around.\"  \"Come on, though, Morey--give me a hand--I got you off dead center.\" Fuller flailed his hand helplessly.  \"Use your brains, if you have any,\" said Morey, \"and see what you can do. Come on, Wade--we're going.\"  Since they were going to use the space control, they would remain in free fall, and Fuller would remain helplessly suspended in mid-air.  The air of the ship suddenly seemed supercharged with energy as the space around them became gray; then the stars were all before them. The ship was moving forward again.  \"Well, old pals,\" said Fuller, \"at least I have traffic blocked fairly well if I feel like it, so eventually you'd have to help me. However--\" He floundered clumsily as he removed one of his foam-rubber space-boots, \"--my brains tell me that action is equal and opposite to reaction!\" And he threw the boot with all possible velocity toward Morey!  The reaction of the motion brought him slowly but surely to a handhold in the wall.  In the meantime, the flying boot caught Morey in the chest with a pronounced _smack_! as he struggled vainly to avoid it. Handicapped by the lack of friction, his arms were not quite powerful enough to move his mass as quickly as his legs might have done, for his inertia was as great as ever, so he didn't succeed in ducking.  \"Round one!\" called Arcot, laughing. \"Won by Kid Fuller on a TKO! It appears he has brains and knows how to use them!\"  \"You win,\" laughed Morey. \"I concede the battle!\"  Arcot had cut off the space-strain drive by the time Fuller reached the control room, and the men set about making more observations. They took additional photographs and turned on the drive again.  Time passed monotonously after they had examined a few stars. There was little difference; each was but a scene of flaming matter. There was little interest in this work, and, as Fuller remarked, this was supposed to be a trip of exploration, not observation. They weren't astronomers; they were on a vacation. Why all the hard work? They couldn't do as good a job as an experienced astronomer, so they decided to limit their observations to those necessary to retrace their path to Earth.  \"But we want to investigate for planets to land on, don't we?\" asked Morey.  \"Sure,\" agreed Fuller. \"But do we have to hunt at random for them? Can't we look for stars like our own sun? Won't they be more apt to have planets like Sol's?\"  \"It's an idea,\" replied Morey.  \"Well, why not try it then?\" Fuller continued logically. \"Let's pick out a G-0 type sun and head for it.\"  They were now well out toward the edge of the Galaxy, some thirty thousand light years from home. Since they had originally headed out along the narrow diameter of the lens-shaped mass of stars that forms our Island Universe, they would reach the edge soon.  \"We won't have much chance of finding a G-0 this far out,\" Arcot pointed out. \"We're about out of stars. We've left most of the Galaxy behind us.\"  \"Then let's go on to another of the galactic nebulae,\" said Morey, looking out into the almost unbroken night of intergalactic space. Only here and there could they see a star, separated from its nearest neighbor by thousands of light years of empty space.  \"You know,\" said Wade slowly, \"I've been wondering about the progress along scientific lines that a race out here might make. I mean, suppose that one of those lonely stars had planets, and suppose intelligent life evolved on one of those planets. I think their progress would be much slower.\"  \"I see what you mean,\" Arcot said. \"To us, of Earth, the stars are gigantic furnaces a few light years away. They're titanic tests tubes of nature, with automatic reading devices attached, hung in the sky for us to watch. We have learned more about space from the stars than all the experiments of the physicists of Earth ever secured for us. It was in the atoms of the suns that we first counted the rate of revolutions of the electrons about their nuclei.\"  \"Couldn't they have watched their own sun?\" Fuller asked.  \"Sure, but what could they compare it with? They couldn't see a white dwarf from here. They couldn't measure the parallax to the nearest star, so they would have no idea of stellar distances. They wouldn't know how bright S Doradus was. Or how dim Van Maanen's star was.\"  \"Then,\" Fuller said speculatively, \"they'd have to wait until one of their scientists invented the telectroscope.\"  Arcot shook his head. \"Without a knowledge of nuclear physics, the invention of the telectroscope is impossible.

MORAVIAN MANSE,  HECKMONDWIKE.     BOOK ONE. THE BOHEMIAN BRETHREN.     CHAPTER I -- THE RISING STORM.  When an ordinary Englishman, in the course of his reading, sees mention made of Moravians, he thinks forthwith of a foreign land, a foreign people and a foreign Church. He wonders who these Moravians may be, and wonders, as a rule, in vain. We have all heard of the Protestant Reformation; we know its principles and admire its heroes; and the famous names of Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Latimer, Cranmer, Knox and other great men are familiar in our ears as household words. But few people in this country are aware of the fact that long before Luther had burned the Pope's bull, and long before Cranmer died at the stake, there had begun an earlier Reformation, and flourished a Reforming Church. It is to tell the story of that Church--the Church of the Brethren--that this little book is written.  For her cradle and her earliest home we turn to the distressful land of Bohemia, and the people called Bohemians, or Czechs. To us English readers Bohemia has many charms. As we call to mind our days at school, we remember, in a dim and hazy way, how famous Bohemians in days of yore have played some part in our national story. We have sung the praises at Christmas time of the Bohemian Monarch, \"Good King Wenceslaus.\" We have read how John, the blind King of Bohemia, fell mortally wounded at the Battle of Crecy, how he died in the tent of King Edward III., and how his generous conqueror exclaimed: \"The crown of chivalry has fallen today; never was the like of this King of Bohemia.\" We have all read, too, how Richard II. married Princess Anne of Bohemia; how the Princess, so the story goes, brought a Bohemian Bible to England; how Bohemian scholars, a few years later, came to study at Oxford; how there they read the writings of Wycliffe, the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\"; and how, finally, copies of Wycliffe's books were carried to Bohemia, and there gave rise to a religious revival of world-wide importance. We have struck the trail of our journey. For one person that Wycliffe stirred in England, he stirred hundreds in Bohemia. In England his influence was fleeting; in Bohemia it was deep and abiding. In England his followers were speedily suppressed by law; in Bohemia they became a great national force, and prepared the way for the foundation of the Church of the Brethren.  For this startling fact there was a very powerful reason. In many ways the history of Bohemia is very like the history of Ireland, and the best way to understand the character of the people is to think of our Irish friends as we know them to-day. They sprang from the old Slavonic stock, and the Slavonic is very like the Keltic in nature. They had fiery Slavonic blood in their veins, and Slavonic hearts beat high with hope in their bosoms. They had all the delightful Slavonic zeal, the Slavonic dash, the Slavonic imagination. They were easy to stir, they were swift in action, they were witty in speech, they were mystic and poetic in soul, and, like the Irish of the present day, they revelled in the joy of party politics, and discussed religious questions with the keenest zest. With them religion came first and foremost. All their poetry was religious; all their legends were religious; and thus the message of Wycliffe fell on hearts prepared to give it a kindly welcome.  Again, Bohemia, like Ireland, was the home of two rival populations. The one was the native Czech, the other was the intruding German; and the two had not yet learned to love each other. From all sides except one these German invaders had come. If the reader will consult a map of Europe he will see that, except on the south-east frontier, where the sister country, Moravia, lies, Bohemia is surrounded by German-speaking States. On the north-east is Silesia, on the north-west Saxony, on the west Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate, and thus Bohemia was flooded with Germans from three sides at once. For years these Germans had been increasing in power, and the whole early history of Bohemia is one dreary succession of bloody wars against German Emperors and Kings. Sometimes the land had been ravaged by German soldiers, sometimes a German King had sat on the Bohemian throne. But now the German settlers in Bohemia had become more powerful than ever. They had settled in large numbers in the city of Prague, and had there obtained special privileges for themselves. They had introduced hundreds of German clergymen, who preached in the German language. They had married their daughters into noble Bohemian families. They had tried to make German the language of the court, had spoken with contempt of the Bohemian language, and had said that it was only fit for slaves. They had introduced German laws into many a town, and German customs into family life; and, worse than all, they had overwhelming power in that pride of the country, the University of Prague. For these Germans the hatred of the people was intense. \"It is better,\" said one of their popular writers, \"for the land to be a desert than to be held by Germans; it is better to marry a Bohemian peasant girl than to marry a German queen.\" And Judas Iscariot himself, said a popular poet, was in all probability a German.  Again, as in Ireland, these national feuds were mixed up with religious differences. The seeds of future strife were early sown. Christianity came from two opposite sources. On the one hand, two preachers, Cyril and Methodius, had come from the Greek Church in Constantinople, had received the blessing of the Pope, and had preached to the people in the Bohemian language; on the other, the German Archbishop of Salzburg had brought in hosts of German priests, and had tried in vain to persuade the Pope to condemn the two preachers as heretics. And the people loved the Bohemian preachers, and hated the German priests. The old feud was raging still. If the "]]]
