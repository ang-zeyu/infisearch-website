A FALSE ALARM.  Mr Rogers had felt a little hesitation in giving the fierce-looking Zulu permission to make one of the party, but as they journeyed on across the apparently interminable plains between the Vaal and the Great Crocodile rivers, he awoke more and more to the fact that he had secured a valuable ally.  For the old warrior entered into the spirit of the expedition at once, helping with the oxen or to extricate the waggons in difficult places, showing himself quite at home in the management of horses, and being evidently an excellent guide, and above all a hunter of profound knowledge and experience.  As soon as he realised the intentions of Mr Rogers, he became most earnest in his endeavours to get the party well on their way farther and farther into the wilds, making the eyes of the boys dilate as he told them in fair English of the herds of antelope and other game he would soon show them in the plains; the giraffes, buffaloes, elephants, and, above all, the lions, whose haunts he knew, and to which he promised to take them.  Whenever the father began to talk in this strain his two sons grew excited, and started to perform hunting dances, in which the number of imaginary lions and buffaloes they slew was something enormous.  Every now and then, too, the boys killed some imaginary elephant, out of whose unwieldy head they made believe to hack the tusks, which they invariably brought and laid at their young masters' feet, grunting the while with the exertion.  Dick soon grew tired of it however.  \"It's all very well,\" he said; \"but if that is the way we are to load the waggons with ivory, we shall be a long time getting enough to pay the expenses of the journey.\"  Mr Rogers joined them one day as they were walking along in advance of the slow-moving waggon, and began to question the Zulu about the game in the wilds north of where they were; and in his broken English he gave so glowing an account that his hearers began to doubt its truth.  He said that when he had had to flee from his own people for his life, he had at first gone right away into the hunting country, and stayed there for a year, finding out, in his wanderings, places where hunting and shooting people had never been.  Here, he declared, the wild creatures had taken refuge as in a sanctuary; and he declared that he should take the boss who had been so kind to his boys, and both the young bosses, to a wild place where they would find game in abundance, and where the forests held the great rhinoceros, plenty of elephants, and amongst whose open glades the tall giraffe browse the leafage of the high trees.  There in the plains were herds of buffalo too numerous to count, quagga, zebra, gnu, eland, and bok of all kinds.  There was a great river there, he said, full of fish, and with great crocodiles ready to seize upon the unwary.  The hippopotamus was there too, big and massive, ready to upset boats or to attack all he could see.  Mr Rogers watched his sons attentively as the Zulu narrated his experience of the land, and he was delighted to see how much Dick was already leaving off his dull languid ways, and taking an interest in what was projected.  One thing the father wished to arrive at, and that was whether Dick would be frightened through his weakness, and the hunting parties consequently do him more harm than good.  But just then a question put by his son showed him that he was as eager as his brother for an encounter with the wild creatures of the forest and plains.  \"And do you say there are lions?\" said Dick.  \"Yes, plenty lion,\" said the Zulu.  \"They come to camp at night, and try to get the ox and horse.\"  \"Oomph! oomph! oomph!\" growled Coffee, in an admirable imitation of the lion's roar.  \"Keep big fire,\" said the Zulu, \"then no lion come.\"  \"Well, Dick,\" said Mr Rogers, \"how do you feel?  Ready for the fray?\"  \"Yes, father, I am longing for the time when we shall get amongst the wild beasts.  I want to try my gun; and I want to grow strong and manly, like Jack.\"  \"All in good time, my boy,\" replied Mr Rogers, smiling.  \"We shall soon be leaving civilisation almost entirely behind, and then you shall make your first attempts at becoming a mighty hunter.\"  Comparatively uninteresting as the journey was, they still had plenty to take their attention--grand views of distant mountains; wondrous sunsets; great flights of birds; but the absence of game was remarkable; and twice over, in spite of their being so well armed and provided, Mr Rogers was glad to purchase a freshly-killed springbok of a Boer, at one of the outlying farms that they passed.  On the seventh night out though, their fortune was better, for they had out-spanned, or loosened their oxen from the waggon, just by a clump of trees in a wide plain, and the Zulu went off the moment they stopped.  Both Peter and Dirk began to complain, for they expected help from their black companion; but upon this occasion they had their work to do without aid, Coffee and Chicory having also gone off with their kiris in search of game.  Mr Rogers and his sons started off to see if they could provide anything palatable for supper; but though there was a swampy lagoon about a mile away, they did not catch sight of a single duck, and were returning tired and disappointed when they caught sight of the Zulu signalling to them to come.  \"He has found something,\" cried Jack eagerly; and they hastened over the rugged intervening space, to find that the father of Coffee and Chicory was evidently a keen hunter, and ready enough in knowing where to look for creatures that would do for food.  With almost unerring instinct he had found out this clump of trees, evidently one where guinea-fowl came to roost; and full of hope that they would now obtain a good addition to the larder, or, in plain English, a few birds to roast for supper, guns were supplied with cartridges, and the little party waited for the coming of the spotted birds.  The pleasurable anticipations of the boys, who had a lively recollection of the toothsome bird with a flavour half-way between roast fowl and pheasant, seemed likely to be damped, for they had been waiting quite half an hour without hearing or seeing anything, when suddenly the Zulu laid his hand upon Jack's arm, and pointed in a direction opposite to the waggon.  \"Well, what are you pointing at?\" said Jack.  \"I can't see anything. Yes, I can; there they are, father.  Look out!\"  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!  Half-a-dozen rapid shots, and then, amidst the whizzing of wings and cries of the birds, some of which flew off, while others ran through the short grass at an astounding rate, Coffee, Chicory, and their father ran out beneath the trees; and the result of the firing was brought in--ten fine plump birds for their supper.  This was the first night that they had passed in the open, the previous halts having been made at some farm; so after the supper the blacks were set to gather in more wood, the fire was well made up, and the oxen secured, it being decided to begin at once upon the regular plan that they would have to adopt in the enemy's country, the enemy being formed of the various wild creatures against whom they were having their campaign.  Years back the spot where they were encamped had been famous for lions, but from what Mr Rogers had heard, none had been seen here now for a considerable time.  Still he thought it better to take precautions, the party being divided into three watches, the first of which he took himself, with Chicory for a companion; Jack was to take the second, with the Zulu; and Dick, Coffee, and Dinny were to form the third.  The oxen and horses having been all secured, the fire was piled up, and those who were to rest gladly availed themselves of the opportunity, and in a very short time nothing was to be heard but the fluttering noise made by the burning fire, and the snorting sigh of one or the other of the horses.  In due time Jack was aroused, to sit up and stare at his father.  \"What's matter?\" he said sleepily.  \"Nothing, only that it is your turn to watch,\" said his father.  \"Why, I've only just lain down,\" replied Jack.  \"It can't be time yet.\"  But a good rub at his eyes seemed to bring a little thoughtfulness as well, and he climbed put of the waggon and descended to the ground.  \"I don't think you will have anything to alarm you, my boy,\" said his father.  \"Wake me up though if there is the slightest sign of danger.\"  Jack promised, and, shivering and uncomfortable, he crept up to the fire, which the Zulu renewed; but though he roasted his face and knees, his back felt horribly cold, and he heartily wished himself at home, and in his snug bed.  But the Zulu began to look round at the cattle, to satisfy himself that all were safe; and then seating himself with his assegai across his knees close to the fire, he began to tell the young Englishman about the dangers that would have surrounded them if they had encamped here a few years earlier; and, then he lapsed into such vivid accounts of his own hunting adventures and escapes, that the four hours' watch seemed to have passed like magic, and Jack was ready to finish the next; but recalling the last injunctions he had received from his father, he went to the waggon, roused up Dick, and from under it Dinny and Coffee, and soon after left them to finish the morning watch.  Jack felt as if it would be of no use to try and sleep again; but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],["title","Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#6)"],["body","that their next day's journey would be very fatiguing, he lay down in his brother's place, found the blankets very warm and cosy, and then, with the sound of Dinny yawning loudly, he fell fast asleep.  He seemed hardly to have closed his eyes, when a shout aroused him, just as he heard his father seize his double rifle, and go to the front of the waggon.  Jack did likewise, with as much speed as his sleepy confusion would allow; and on reaching the opening he found that it was still dark, so that he could not have been long asleep, the fire was burning brilliantly, and every one was on the alert.  \"Yes, I seemed to hear it myself in my sleep,\" said Mr Rogers, in answer to some words spoken by Dick.  \"Did it sound near?\"  \"Sure, sor, it was close by, and I thought the bastes had got one of the bullocks.\"  The Zulu was with them now, having sprung from his place beneath the waggon, asking eagerly what was wrong.  \"They heard a lion prowling round,\" replied Mr Rogers.  \"No, no,\" said the Zulu.  \"No lion here.\"  \"But I heard it quite plainly,\" said Dick, who felt angry at being doubted.  \"Sure and I did too, so close to me shoulder that I could feel the baste's breath blow over on to me chake.\"  \"No, no,\" said the Zulu.  \"Look! see!\"  He pointed towards the oxen and horses in turn.  \"But it would be impossible to see it in this darkness,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"Yes, but the oxen,\" said the Zulu.  \"They would not lie quiet if there was a lion.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Mr Rogers, envying the savage his knowledge. \"Then what caused the alarm?\"  There was no reply; and after satisfying themselves that all was safe, and piling up the rest of the wood upon the fire--for the streaks of the coming dawn could be seen--the tired watchers returned to the waggon, and slept until roused for breakfast, when the secret of the alarm came out, Coffee having been afraid to confess at the time that he knew it was his brother imitating the lion's cry in his sleep, his proximity to Dick and Dinny making it seem the more real.  Feeling sure that he would be punished if he spoke, Coffee had remained silent, and so the matter ended, Dick laughing heartily at the false alarm, though Dinny would not believe that the cry emanated from the boy.  \"Jist as if I was such a biby as to belave that story, Masther Jack,\" he said.  \"I tell ye it was the lion himself attacking the bastes, and you'll see he'll be about the camp now every night, as regular as clockwork.  It's very good of the masther to try and put one at his aise about the wild bastes; but that there was a lion--I know it was; and if, Masther Jack, dear, I'm missing some night, ye may know that there's a lion aiting of me; and I hope ye'll take me bones back and give me a dacent burying somewhere among Christians, and not lave them kicking about out here in a foreign land.\"  \"But how can you be so stupid, Dinny?  Father says it was Chicory, and you know how he imitates the wild beasts.\"  \"Ah, do ye take me for a baby, Masther Jack?\" said the man, reproachfully.  \"There, let it go.  I'm your father's servant, and he must have his own way; but it's cruel work this coming out into such savage lands; and there's one man as will niver see home parts again.\"  When once Dinny had got an idea in his, head, to use his own words, \"a shillelagh would not knock it out;\" so he remained perfectly certain that the camp had been attacked by a lion; and he went about prophesying that the coming night would produce two.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  HOW THE BOYS FOUND IT WAS NOT EASY TO SHOOT.  The oxen were in-spanned and the horses saddled, on as glorious a morning as ever shone over the great African continent.  The breakfast things had been stowed away, a glance given round to see that nothing had been left behind; the driver's and foreloper's whips cracked; and with loud shouts of, \"Trek, boys, trek!\" the great waggon slowly went on its course, every one forgetting the troubles of the disturbed night, in the glorious sunshine and dew-glittering herbage.  Coffee and Chicory ran and bounded and spun their kiris in the air, catching them again, and then running on beside the cantering horses of their young masters, while their father ran beside Mr Rogers' big bay. Above all, the dogs showed their delight by barking, yelping, and making insane charges here and there, Rough'un's great delight being to run his head into one or other of the holes made by the burrowing animals of the plains, and then worrying and snapping at nothing until he was called away.  As the waggon lumbered on, father and sons wandered off to left or right, exploring, examining the trees and strange plants, and sometimes bringing down some bright-plumaged bird, which was carefully laid in a tin case carried for the purpose by the Zulu, ready to be skinned and dressed to keep as a specimen on their return.  That they were approaching the game country was now hourly becoming plainer, for from time to time little knots of bok could be seen upon the hills; but when Dick or Jack eagerly drew the attention of the Zulu to the fact, he laughed, and said it was nothing, bidding them to wait.  \"We must have some venison for dinner to-day, boys,\" said Mr Rogers, cantering up; \"so one of you had better try your rifle.  Who's it to be?\"  \"Let it be Jack, father,\" said Dick, quietly; \"my hands are not steady yet.\"  \"Very good,\" said Mr Rogers; while the Zulu listened attentively, trying to comprehend every word.  \"Now then, Jack, how shall you go to work?  There is a little herd of half-a-dozen springbok there, on that hill, nearly a mile away.\"  \"Get close and shoot them,\" replied Jack, stoutly.  \"Say, if you can, my boy,\" replied Mr Rogers, smiling.  \"Now look here, Jack, this is the way the Boers shoot springbok, and I don't think you will find a better plan.  Have a few cartridges handy, so that you can load quickly, and then gallop easily towards the herd, which will begin playing about, till they grow too alarmed to let you get nearer, and then they'll bound off.  This is your time: gallop up as close as you can, and when you see they are about to go, leap from your horse and fire--reload, and fire again.  If you are very quick you may get three shots at the herd before they are out of range.\"  \"But suppose I miss, father?\" said Jack.  \"Don't suppose anything of the kind, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, smiling; \"but go and do it.  Time enough to consider failure when you have failed.\"  Jack nodded, opened the breech of his gun, placed half-a-dozen cartridges ready, leaped down to tighten the girths of his saddle, the cob standing perfectly still.  Then mounting once more, he waved his hand, touched his horse's sides with his heels, and away it went like the wind.  As he started, Chicory, who seemed to have adopted him as his leader, made a bound at the saddle, caught hold of the pommel, and ran by his side with marvellous speed.  The springbok seemed to pay not the slightest heed to their approach, and Jack was beginning to feel excited with the chase, and to calculate how far they should be able to get before having to dismount, when all at once there was a sudden check; he went flying over his horse's head, his double barrel escaped from his hand, and he found himself lying on the hard sandy earth, confused and puzzled, with Chicory trying to pull him up; and Stockings standing close by, snorting and shivering with fear.  Jack got up, and limped to where his rifle lay, feeling stupid, and wondering how it was that he had been thrown; and he had but regained his piece, and was ruefully examining it, when his father and Dick came galloping up.  \"Much hurt, my boy?\" cried Mr Rogers, eagerly.  \"Only my leg and arm a little,\" said Jack, rubbing first one and then the other; \"but I did think I could ride better than that, father.\"  \"Ride, my boy?  Why, no one could have helped that.  Don't you know how it was?\"  \"I know Stockings threw me,\" replied Jack.  \"Threw you?  Nonsense, boy!  He set his fore feet in an ant-bear hole, and turned a complete somersault.  We were afraid that he had rolled upon you.\"  \"Then a good rider couldn't have helped it, father?\"  \"Helped it?  No, my boy.\"  \"Oh, I feel better now,\" said Jack, laughing; and, limping up to his horse, he patted its neck and remounted, though not without difficulty. \"Where's the bok, Chicory?\"  Chicory pointed to where they were, nearly a mile away, and looking exceedingly small, but quite clear in the bright African atmosphere; and without a word he set off again.  \"Ought he to go, father?\" said Dick.  \"Yes, my boy.  He is not much hurt, and it will be a lesson to both him and his horse.  I am glad to see that he has so much spirit.\"  A short chuckle close by made Mr Rogers turn his head, and he saw that the Zulu understood his words, and was smiling approval.  \"Brave boy!  Make big hunter warrior, some day,\" said the Zulu.  \"Boss Dick big brave hunter too,\" cried Coffee indignantly, as he went and laid a hand upon the neck of Dick's horse.  \"Boss Dick go shoot bok?\"  \"Not now, Coffee,\" replied Dick, smiling; and then the little group remained watching Jack, who was in full chase of the springbok, which, as he came nearer, began to skip and bound and gambol together, leaping over each other's backs, but all the time watching the coming enemy.  It was an exciting time for Jack, and in it he forgot the pain in his shoulder and the stiffness of his leg.  He had the rifle-barrel ready cocked, and his feet out of the stirrups, and at last, when he had galloped up to within a couple of hundred yards, he saw such evident preparations for flight on the part of the little bok, that he leaped down, dropped upon one knee, and fired straight at the flying herd.  Before the smoke had risen he had another cartridge in the rifle, and fired again.  Once more he threw open the breech and loaded--and fired, though by this time the bok were seven or eight hundred yards away.  But in spite of the care in the aim taken, no"]]]
