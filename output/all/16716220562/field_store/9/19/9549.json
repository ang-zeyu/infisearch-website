Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or ‘_risus sardonicus_,’ as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?”  “Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,” I answered,—“some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.”  “That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine the thorn.”  I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.  “Is that an English thorn?” he asked.  “No, it certainly is not.”  “With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.”  As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.  “Here’s a business!” he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. “Here’s a pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!”  “I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,” said Holmes, quietly.  “Why, of course I do!” he wheezed. “It’s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I’ll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It’s true you set us on the right track; but you’ll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.”  “It was a piece of very simple reasoning.”  “Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,—no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d’you think the man died of?”  “Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over,” said Holmes, dryly.  “No, no. Still, we can’t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?”  “Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.”  “Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That’s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times.—Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain.—What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How’s that?”  “On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.”  “Hum! There’s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto _was_ with his brother; there _was_ a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is—well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.”  “You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,” said Holmes. “This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man’s scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?”  “Confirms it in every respect,” said the fat detective, pompously. “House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,—a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.” With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.  “He can find something,” remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “He has occasional glimmerings of reason. _Il n’y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l’esprit!_”  “You see!” said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. “Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.”  “It was I who opened it.”  “Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?” He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. “Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!”  “Yes, sir,” from the passage.  “Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.—Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the Queen’s name as being concerned in the death of your brother.”  “There, now! Didn’t I tell you!” cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.  “Don’t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes. “I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.”  “Don’t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,—don’t promise too much!” snapped the detective. “You may find it a harder matter than you think.”  “Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man—”  “Ah! the other man—?” asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other’s manner.  “Is a rather curious person,” said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. “I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.—A word with you, Watson.”  He led me out to the head of the stair. “This unexpected occurrence,” he said, “has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.”  “I have just been thinking so,” I answered. “It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.”  “No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?”  “By no means. I don’t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.”  “Your presence will be of great service to me,” he answered. “We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare’s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, down near the water’s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer’s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.”  “A dog, I suppose.”  “Yes,—a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would rather have Toby’s help than that of the whole detective force of London.”  “I shall bring him, then,” said I. “It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.”  “And I,” said Holmes, “shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones’s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. ‘_Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen._’ Goethe is always pithy.”     Chapter VII The Episode of the Barrel   The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,—so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2098"],["title","A Thief in the Night: A Book of Raffles' Adventures (#0)"],["body","Thief in the Night  [A Book of Raffles' Adventures]   by  E. W. Hornung     Contents    Out of Paradise   The Chest of Silver   The Rest Cure   The Criminologists' Club   The Field of Phillipi   A Bad Night   A Trap to Catch a Cracksman   The Spoils of Sacrilege   The Raffles Relics     Out of Paradise  If I must tell more tales of Raffles, I can but back to our earliest days together, and fill in the blanks left by discretion in existing annals.  In so doing I may indeed fill some small part of an infinitely greater blank, across which you may conceive me to have stretched my canvas for the first frank portrait of my friend.  The whole truth cannot harm him now.  I shall paint in every wart.  Raffles was a villain, when all is written; it is no service to his memory to glaze the fact; yet I have done so myself before to-day.  I have omitted whole heinous episodes.  I have dwelt unduly on the redeeming side. And this I may do again, blinded even as I write by the gallant glamour that made my villain more to me than any hero.  But at least there shall be no more reservations, and as an earnest I shall make no further secret of the greatest wrong that even Raffles ever did me.  I pick my words with care and pain, loyal as I still would be to my friend, and yet remembering as I must those Ides of March when he led me blindfold into temptation and crime.  That was an ugly office, if you will.  It was a moral bagatelle to the treacherous trick he was to play me a few weeks later.  The second offence, on the other hand, was to prove the less serious of the two against society, and might in itself have been published to the world years ago.  There have been private reasons for my reticence.  The affair was not only too intimately mine, and too discreditable to Raffles.  One other was involved in it, one dearer to me than Raffles himself, one whose name shall not even now be sullied by association with ours.  Suffice it that I had been engaged to her before that mad March deed. True, her people called it \"an understanding,\" and frowned even upon that, as well they might.  But their authority was not direct; we bowed to it as an act of politic grace; between us, all was well but my unworthiness.  That may be gauged when I confess that this was how the matter stood on the night I gave a worthless check for my losses at baccarat, and afterward turned to Raffles in my need.  Even after that I saw her sometimes.  But I let her guess that there was more upon my soul than she must ever share, and at last I had written to end it all. I remember that week so well!  It was the close of such a May as we had never had since, and I was too miserable even to follow the heavy scoring in the papers.  Raffles was the only man who could get a wicket up at Lord's, and I never once went to see him play.  Against Yorkshire, however, he helped himself to a hundred runs as well; and that brought Raffles round to me, on his way home to the Albany.  \"We must dine and celebrate the rare event,\" said he.  \"A century takes it out of one at my time of life; and you, Bunny, you look quite as much in need of your end of a worthy bottle.  Suppose we make it the Café Royal, and eight sharp?   I'll be there first to fix up the table and the wine.\"  And at the Café Royal I incontinently told him of the trouble I was in. It was the first he had ever heard of my affair, and I told him all, though not before our bottle had been succeeded by a pint of the same exemplary brand.  Raffles heard me out with grave attention.  His sympathy was the more grateful for the tactful brevity with which it was indicated rather than expressed.  He only wished that I had told him of this complication in the beginning; as I had not, he agreed with me that the only course was a candid and complete renunciation.  It was not as though my divinity had a penny of her own, or I could earn an honest one.  I had explained to Raffles that she was an orphan, who spent most of her time with an aristocratic aunt in the country, and the remainder under the repressive roof of a pompous politician in Palace Gardens.  The aunt had, I believed, still a sneaking softness for me, but her illustrious brother had set his face against me from the first.  \"Hector Carruthers!\" murmured Raffles, repeating the detested name with his clear, cold eye on mine.  \"I suppose you haven't seen much of him?\"  \"Not a thing for ages,\" I replied.  \"I was at the house two or three days last year, but they've neither asked me since nor been at home to me when I've called.  The old beast seems a judge of men.\"  And I laughed bitterly in my glass.  \"Nice house?\" said Raffles, glancing at himself in his silver cigarette-case.  \"Top shelf,\" said I.  \"You know the houses in Palace Gardens, don't you?\"  \"Not so well as I should like to know them, Bunny.\"  \"Well, it's about the most palatial of the lot.  The old ruffian is as rich as Crœsus.  It's a country-place in town.\"  \"What about the window-fastenings?\" asked Raffles casually.  I recoiled from the open cigarette-case that he proffered as he spoke. Our eyes met; and in his there was that starry twinkle of mirth and mischief, that sunny beam of audacious devilment, which had been my undoing two months before, which was to undo me as often as he chose until the chapter's end.  Yet for once I withstood its glamour; for once I turned aside that luminous glance with front of steel.  There was no need for Raffles to voice his plans.  I read them all between the strong lines of his smiling, eager face.  And I pushed back my chair in the equal eagerness of my own resolve.  \"Not if I know it!\" said I.  \"A house I've dined in--a house I've  seen her in--a house where she stays by the month together!  Don't put it into words, Raffles, or I'll get up and go.\"  \"You mustn't do that before the coffee and liqueur,\" said Raffles laughing.  \"Have a small Sullivan first: it's the royal road to a cigar.  And now let me observe that your scruples would do you honor if old Carruthers still lived in the house in question.\"  \"Do you mean to say he doesn't?\"  Raffles struck a match, and handed it first to me.  \"I mean to say, my dear Bunny, that Palace Gardens knows the very name no more.  You began by telling me you had heard nothing of these people all this year. That's quite enough to account for our little misunderstanding. I was thinking of the house, and you were thinking of the people in the house.\"  \"But who are they, Raffles?  Who has taken the house, if old Carruthers has moved, and how do you know that it is still worth a visit?\"  \"In answer to your first question--Lord Lochmaben,\" replied Raffles, blowing bracelets of smoke toward the ceiling.  \"You look as though you had never heard of him; but as the cricket and racing are the only part of your paper that you condescend to read, you can't be expected to keep track of all the peers created in your time.  Your other question is not worth answering.  How do you suppose that I know these things? It's my business to get to know them, and that's all there is to it. As a matter of fact, Lady Lochmaben has just as good diamonds as Mrs. Carruthers ever had; and the chances are that she keeps them where Mrs. Carruthers kept hers, if you could enlighten me on that point.\"  As it happened, I could, since I knew from his niece that it was one on which Mr. Carruthers had been a faddist in his time.  He had made quite a study of the cracksman's craft, in a resolve to circumvent it with his own.  I remembered myself how the ground-floor windows were elaborately bolted and shuttered, and how the doors of all the rooms opening upon the square inner hall were fitted with extra Yale locks, at an unlikely height, not to be discovered by one within the room.  It had been the butler's business to turn and to collect all these keys before retiring for the night.  But the key of the safe in the study was supposed to be in the jealous keeping of the master of the house himself.  That safe was in its turn so ingeniously hidden that I never should have found it for myself.  I well remember how one who showed it to me (in the innocence of her heart) laughed as she assured me that even her little trinkets were solemnly locked up in it every night.  It had been let into the wall behind one end of the book-case, expressly to preserve the barbaric splendor of Mrs. Carruthers; without a doubt these Lochmabens would use it for the same purpose; and in the altered circumstances I had no hesitation in giving Raffles all the information he desired.  I even drew him a rough plan of the ground-floor on the back of my menu-card.  \"It was rather clever of you to notice the kind of locks on the inner doors,\" he remarked as he put it in his pocket.  \"I suppose you don't remember if it was a Yale on the front door as well?\"  \"It was not,\" I was able to answer quite promptly.  \"I happen to know because I once had the key when--when we went to a theatre together.\"  \"Thank you, old chap,\" said Raffles sympathetically.  \"That's all I shall want from you, Bunny, my boy.  There's no night like to-night!\"  It was one of his sayings when bent upon his worst.  I looked at him aghast.  Our cigars were just in blast, yet already he was signalling for his bill.  It was impossible to remonstrate with him until we were both outside in the street.  \"I'm coming with you,\" said I, running my arm through his.  \"Nonsense, Bunny!\"  \"Why is it nonsense?  I know every inch of the ground, and since the house has changed hands I have no compunction.  Besides, 'I have been there' in the other sense as well: once a thief, you know!  In for a penny, in for a pound!\"  It was ever my mood when the blood was up.  But my old friend failed to appreciate the characteristic as he usually did.  We crossed Regent Street in silence.  I had to catch his sleeve to keep a hand in his inhospitable arm.  \"I really think you had better stay away,\" said Raffles as we reached the other curb.  \"I've no use"]]]
