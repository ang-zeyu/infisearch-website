Bringing me this, he paused awhile,       and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for       my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when       he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he       came back—but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,       which proved to be all the paper missing—it having been torn, it       seems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in       finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left—being       guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still       emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution,       and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It       was very probable, I considered, that some words were written       upon that side of the paper which had not been examined—but which       side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in       this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there       were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a       proper manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of       ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the       phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third       attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I       placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes       thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I       thought it barely possible that the written side might have some       unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling       might enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment       and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first       presented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned       the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my       forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly       slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it       proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute       remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered       the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then,       was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should       finally prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as       I had previously done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a       brilliancy ensued as before—but this time several lines of MS. in       a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly       visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but       momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would       have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three       sentences before me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety,       however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the       seven concluding words, which thus appeared—“blood—your life       depends upon lying close.”        Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the       full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted       to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed       a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly       convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing       and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the       fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too, that word of       all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and       terror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how chilly and       heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to       qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid       the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my       soul!        Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain       concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could       be—but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution       of the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the       trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the       singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making       myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not       succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the       orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able to       accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had       given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to       endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able       to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and       I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a       paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress,       where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind       of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and       recollection.        At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon       the horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours       it was barely possible that I might exist without water—for a       longer time I could not do so. During the first portion of my       imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which       Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever,       without in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now only       about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach       liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely       consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the       skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had       been eaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my       headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of       delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first       falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest       difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so       doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of       the chest. But there was still another and very different source       of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been       the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the       mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.        I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in       the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he       ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too       greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the       circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw       myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.       Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my       ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting       and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his       eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him,       when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.       Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again       awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four       times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a       degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying       close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a       kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly       convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the       confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at       a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of       killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own       safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me       with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected       every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my       terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from       the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition       should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to       pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate       my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by       the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his       white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of       the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured       them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which       Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely       as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No       sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl       toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the       right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the       enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my       knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these       protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt       the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which       enveloped my neck—yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate       all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would       place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I       rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging       with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over       him, and before he could extricate himself, I had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#8)"],["body","through the       door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this       struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of       ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to       a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I       felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which       might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar       circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it       to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.        Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my       name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the       direction of the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the       kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the       sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. My powers of speech       totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should       conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I       stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling       convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a       thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken       it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber       somewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less       distinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget       my feelings at this moment? He was going—my friend, my companion,       from whom I had a right to expect so much—he was going—he would       abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to       expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons—and one       word, one little syllable, would save me—yet that single syllable       I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand       times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,       deadly sick, against the end of the box.        As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of       my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.       Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my       ears! With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the       effect of the noise upon Augustus—for I knew that the person who       called my name could be no one but himself. All was silent for       some moments. At length I again heard the word “Arthur!” repeated       in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. Reviving hope loosened       at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my       voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be       silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will       be with you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the       hold.” For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and       every moment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon       my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water       to my lips. Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the       jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of       thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which       encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the       unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest       of all physical luxuries afforded.        When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced       from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured       with the greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a       dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less       comfort than the food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the       cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what       had happened on board during my incarceration.     CHAPTER 4         The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he       had left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be       remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and,       during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and       so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and       staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the       risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. When at length       he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as       possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but       little uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an       opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that       he found one. Several times during this interval he had made up       his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me       come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of       Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had       escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put       back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking       the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that       I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case,       to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he considered       everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with       an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,       did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the       watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He       then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,       intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get       me to come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the       stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for       this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was       snoring very loudly. From all the calculations I can make on the       subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just       after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,       consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days       and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both       from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be       acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench       arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think       of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the       long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling       vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after       once falling asleep, than that I should have slept       uninterruptedly for the period specified above.        Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing       the trap—but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and       spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone—still I       continued to snore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would       take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box,       and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain       Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in       arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the       voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and       await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily       induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most       tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone       any inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his       mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an       unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the       cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed       it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner had he       put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his       face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from       a handspike.        A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp       upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on       around him. His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along       the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep       wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a       continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.       Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of       fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from       which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.       Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were       rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they       soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides       Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in       the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s       company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with       them after having secured his arms behind his back. They       proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down—two       of the mutineers standing by it with axes—two also at the main       hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear there       below? tumble up with you, one by one—now, mark that—and no       grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:—at last       an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping       piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to       spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an       axe. The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the       black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and       tossed him deliberately into the sea. Hearing the blow and"]]]
