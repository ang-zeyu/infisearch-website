I can safely say that never in my life since that moment have I caught myself talking during \"play\" in a cricket match.  I felt in disgrace, and got nervous; I dared not look at Steel, for fear of meeting his eye.  I wished myself a mile away, and repented of my satisfaction of being in the first eleven.  Most devoutly I hoped no ball would chance near me, as I should assuredly miss it.  As the thought passed my mind the man who was batting cut a ball hard and low in my direction.  It was so hard and so low that under any circumstances it would have been a most difficult ball to field, still more to catch. It flew towards me a few inches from the ground, and I was in despair. I knew every eye in the field was on me--Steel's in particular.  Here would be some hundreds of witnesses to my utter imbecility!  Would that the ground would swallow me!  I sprang forward and tripped as I sprang. In my fall the ball dashed into my hand, and fell from it to the earth. I had missed the catch, and my disgrace was complete.  Fancy then my astonishment when I heard Steel's awful voice cry, \"Well tried, sir!\" and when a distant sound of clapping reached me from the tents!  I could not understand it at first; but I afterwards found out that by my lucky trip I had more nearly succeeded in catching the ball than a more experienced player would have done had he kept his balance, and so I got credit for a good piece of play which I did not in the least deserve. However, it served to recover me from my nervousness and bad spirits, and incite me to a desire to accomplish something for which I could honestly take credit.  Never was such a determination more called for than now.  Driver, the captain of the Westfield eleven, was at the wickets, a most tremendous hitter.  All bowling came alike to him.  The swifter the ball the happier he was; sending one over the bowler's head, another nearly into the scorers' tent, another among the spectators behind the ropes.  The score, hitherto so slow, began to fly up.  Forty, fifty, sixty, seventy we saw posted up in rapid succession, and wondered how it all would end. He seemed to have as many lives as a cat.  Some easy catches were missed, and some \"runs out\" were only just avoided.  Still he scored, no matter who his partner was (and one or two came and went while he was in); he hit away merrily, and the cheers of Westfield grew almost monotonous from their frequency.  We on the \"off\" side, however, had not much to do, for nearly all Driver's hits were to the \"on,\" and, curiously enough, nearly all found their way between two of our men, the \"mid-wicket on\" and the \"long on,\" just out of the reach of either.  I could not help wondering why neither of these fellows altered his place, so as to guard the weak point.  It is curious how sometimes in cricket the same thing occurs to two people at the same time.  While I was inwardly speculating on the result of this change of position, Steel appeared to become aware of the same necessity, for I saw him behind the batsman's back silently motioning \"mid-wicket on\" to stand farther back, and \"mid on\" to come round to a \"square\" position.  This manoeuvre, however, did not escape the wily Driver, who sent his next ball to leg, and the next to the identical spot \"mid-wicket on\" had just quitted.  Still, Steel motioned to them to remain in their new posts.  He knew well enough that if a man has a habit of hitting in any one direction, however studiously he tries to avoid the place.  Nature will sooner or later assert herself, and the ball will fly where it has been wont to fly.  So it was in this case. He could _not_ resist an impulse to lift one specially tempting ball in the direction of his old haunt, and sure enough in so doing he sent it clean into \"long on's\" hands, and with his own innings ended, to our great relief, the innings of his side, for a total score of 174, of which he had contributed quite the odd 74.  It was a good round score to overtake, and things did not promise cheerfully for us at the commencement of our innings.  The Westfield men were happy in possessing two swift bowlers, who made havoc of the first two or three on our side who presented themselves.  I was one of these.  When I started for the wickets, armed with pads and gloves and bat, I did not feel happy; still, I was in hopes I might at least succeed in \"breaking my duck's egg,\" which was more than could be said for either of my predecessors.  I felt rather important as I requested the umpire to give me \"middle,\" and hammered the mark a little with my bat.  Still, my feet fidgeted; there was a sort of \"cobwebby\" feeling on my face, and a tickling sensation in the small of my back, as I stood ready for my first ball, which convinced me I was by no means at home in my new position.  \"Play!\" cries the umpire.  The bowler starts to run, with arm extended.  He makes a sort of curve round the wicket, and balances himself on one foot as he discharges his ball.  It comes like lightning, right on to my bat, twisting it in my grasp, and then is snatched up in an instant by \"point,\" who tosses it to the wicket-keeper, who returns it to the bowler.  All this is very alarming.  Here are eleven men banded together with the one object of putting me out, and they are all so quiet and determined about it that I feel like a guilty thing as I stand there to defend my wicket.  The bowler starts again for his sinuous run, and again the ball whizzes from his hand.  I lift my bat in an attempt to strike it; it slips under it; there is a little \"click\" behind my back, and then the ball flies aloft, and I discover that my services at the wicket are no longer required.  So ended my first innings.  Happily for our side, some of the men who went in afterwards made a better show than we three unfortunates who had opened the ball had done.  Steel made forty, and two others about twenty each, which, added to the odds and ends contributed by the rest of our side, brought the Parkhurst score up to 102--72 runs behind our competitors.  There was great jubilation among the Westfield partisans, as their heroes entered on their second innings under such promising auspices, especially when the redoubtable Driver went in first with the bat which had wrought such wonders in the former innings.  There seemed every probability, too, of his repeating his late performance with even greater vigour, for the first ball which reached him he sent flying far and high right over the tents for six, a magnificent hit, which fairly deserved the praise it received, not from the Westfield fellows only, but from ours, who for a moment could forget their rivalry to admire a great exploit.  The next three balls were delivered to his partner at the wickets, who blocked carefully, evidently bent on acting on the defensive while his companion made the running.  From the fifth ball of that over a bye was scored, which brought Driver once again to the end facing the bowler.  The next ball came slightly to the \"off,\" and he tried to cut it.  Either he miscalculated, or was careless about the direction he gave it, for he lodged it clean into my hands, a safe and easy catch, but a catch of enormous importance to our side, as it disposed once and for all of our most dreaded opponent.  Bereft of their champion, the Westfield fellows only succeeded in putting together the moderate score of fifty in their second innings, of which twenty-four were contributed by one man.  So our spirits revived somewhat, as we discovered we had only 123 to make to win.  That was indeed plenty against such bowling, but it was a good deal less than we had dreaded.  Well, the decisive innings began, as soon as we had fortified ourselves with lunch, provided for us by our hospitable rivals.  The afternoon was getting on, but still the crowd of spectators kept together patiently, determined to see the end of the match.  \"Shall we do it?\"  I heard some one ask of Steel.  \"Do what?\" was the evasive reply.  \"Win,\" said the other.  \"How do I know?\" was our captain's curt answer.  If there was one thing that annoyed Steel above others, it was to be asked foolish questions.  He sent in two steady men first, with orders not to be in a hurry to score, but to \"break the back\" of the bowling.  And this advice they faithfully acted upon.  For over after over there was nothing but blocking.  In vain the bowlers strained every nerve to get round or under those stubborn bats.  They could not do it!  Runs came few and far between--the field had nothing to do--and altogether the game became very monotonous.  But those fellows did better service to our side than many who scored more and played in more brilliant style.  We could see their prolonged stand was not without its effect on the Westfield bowlers.  Their bowling became less and less steady, and their style seemed to lose its precision, as ball after ball fell hopelessly off those obstinate bats.  This was evidently just what Steel wanted, and we could tell by his frequent \"Played, sir!\" how thoroughly he approved of the steady discipline of his men.  After a time the very monotony of the game seemed to excite the spectators, who answered each neat \"block\" with a cheer, which showed they, too, could appreciate the tactics of our captain.  It was getting desperate for Westfield, and humiliating too, when one of their bowlers happened to change his style.  Instead of the slashing round-arm balls which he had hitherto sent in, he suddenly and without warning put in an underhand lob--an easy, slow, tempting ball, apparently bound to rise exactly on the player's bat.  Our man fell into the snare.  I could hear Steel, who was near me, groan, as we watched him lift the bat which had till now remained so well under control, and stepping forward prepare for a terrific \"slog.\" Alas! the deceitful ball never rose at all, but pitching quietly a foot before"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],["title","Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#7)"],["body"," crease, shot forward along the ground, and found its way at last to the wicket, amid the tremendous shouts of all the crowd.  A parting being thus made between the two steady partners, the survivor, as is so often the case, did not long remain behind his companion, and when Steel went in, three wickets had already fallen with only fifteen runs.  Will our captain save us from defeat?  See him stand coolly at the wicket--how sure of himself he seems!--how indifferent to that imposing combination of bowlers and fielders which surround him!  He takes his time to get comfortably settled at his wicket, and kneels down to tighten a shoestring, as if nobody was waiting for him.  Then pulling down the peak of his cap to shade his eyes from the sun, he leisurely turns his face to the bowler, and announces himself ready for the worst that desperate character can do to him.  We watched breathlessly the result of his first over, and with an excitement strangely in contrast with the indifferent and apparently careless demeanour of the batsman himself.  It was soon apparent, however, that we might dismiss all anxiety from our minds as to his safety, for he set briskly to work, punishing every ball that came to him, yet never giving a single chance.  I have rarely seen such good \"all-round play.\"  Unlike the Westfield captain, who was strong only on the leg side of the wicket, he was thoroughly at home from whatever side the attack was delivered.  Some balls he hit to \"leg,\" and some he cut with terrific force past \"cover-point.\"  No ball came amiss to him; he was up to \"twisters,\" and \"lobs,\" and \"thunderbolts,\" and walked into them all with faultless dexterity.  Up went our score.  Twenty grew to forty, and forty to fifty.  It was all a matter of time now.  If the five remaining men still to go in could together make a stand long enough to enable him to overtake the enemy's score, he would assuredly do it, unless some unforeseen accident prevented it.  Of these five I was next in order; nor was it long before my turn arrived, and I found myself sallying forth to join my captain at the wickets.  Remembering the poor figure I had cut in the first innings, I was not very sanguine of distinguishing myself on this occasion.  Still, there was something in being opposite Steel which gave me confidence, and relieved me of the nervous sensations which marked my late _debut_.  The first ball or two after my arrival fell to the lot of Steel, who sent them flying promptly, and gave me some running to do in consequence.  This helped still more to make me comfortable, so that when at last my turn came to be bowled at, I experienced none of the desolate feeling which had rendered my former brief innings so unhappy.  I manage to block the first ball, and the second also.  Then comes a third, under which I contrive to get my bat and send it flying.  \"Come!\" shouts Steel, and I run.  \"Another!\" he cries; and I run again, and am safe back before the ball returns to the wicket-keeper's hands.  Positively I had scored two!  I felt as proud as if I had been elected an M.P.  The next ball went for two more, and I could hear a cheer from the tent, which made me feel very valiant.  I glanced to the signal- board; our score was ninety-six, only twenty-seven to win!  Why should not I be able to hold out until Steel made up the figure, and so defeat Westfield by four wickets?  At any rate I would try; and I sent my next ball for a single.  Then it was Steel's turn to bat.  Of course he would send it flying.  Horrors!  He has missed it!  A deafening shout proclaims that his glorious innings is at an end, and I feel like an orphan as I watch him, with his bat under his arm, quitting the wicket at which he had put together sixty-six runs in as fine a style as any player ever did.  It was good to hear the applause which welcomed him back to the tent.  But what was to become of us?  Here were twenty-six runs to get, and the four weakest batsmen of our side to play.  However, one can but do his best.  So I played as carefully as I could, becoming gradually accustomed to the bowling, and knocking an occasional one or two on to the score.  My new companion, however, kept me company but a short time, and his successor shorter still.  This fellow coming in now is our last man. Will he and I ever be able to stick together till these fifteen runs which are now required can be made up?  \"Steady, Tom,\" I whisper, as he passes me on the way to his wicket.  He winks his answer.  It is a responsible thing for us two youngsters, with the whole fate of the school depending on us.  But we keep cool, and play our very best. One by one the score runs up.  Ten to win--now eight, seven.  It is getting exciting.  The crowd hangs eagerly on the result of each ball. Another two from my companion.  The Westfield fellows look nervously at the signal-board, as if by watching it they could make our figure grow less.  But, no!  Another two, from my bat this time, and then a single. Only two to win!  The next ball gets past my comrade's bat, and skims within a hair's-breadth of his bails.  \"Steady, now!\" cries Steel, cheerily.  \"Mind what you're at!\"  Steady it is.  The next two balls are blocked dead.  Then my companion makes a single.  Hurrah!  We are equal now.  At any rate defeat is averted!  Now for victory!  It is my turn to bat; but this ball is not the sort of one to play tricks with; so with an effort I keep my bat square, and stop it without hitting.  \"Played, sir!\" cries some one, approvingly, and I feel my self-denial rewarded.  But the next ball is not so dangerous.  I can see it is a careless one, which I may safely punish.  Punish it I will; so I step forward, and catching it on the bound, bang it I know not and care not where.  What shouting! what cheering as we run, one, two, three, four, five times across the wickets!  The match is ours, with a wicket to spare; and as we ride back that evening to Parkhurst, and talk and laugh and exult over that day's victory, we are the happiest eleven fellows, without exception, that ever rode on the top of an omnibus.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A BOATING ADVENTURE AT PARKHURST.  Once, and once only, did I play truant from Parkhurst, and that transgression was attended with consequences so tragical that to this day its memory is as vivid and impressive as if the event I am about to record had happened only last week, instead of a quarter of a century ago.  I shall recall it in the hope of deterring my readers from following my foolish example--or at least of warning them of the terrible results which may ensue from a thoughtless act of wrong-doing.  I have already mentioned that Parkhurst stood some two or three miles above the point at which the River Colven flows into the sea.  From the school-house we could often catch the hum of the waves breaking lazily along the shore of Colveston Bay; or, if the wind blew hard from the sea, it carried with it the roar of the breakers on the bar mouth, and the distant thunder of the surf on the stony beach.  Of course, our walks and rambles constantly took the direction of the shores of this bay; and though, perhaps, a schoolboy is more readily impressed with other matters than the beauties of nature, I can remember even now the once familiar view from Raven Cliff as if my eyes still rested upon it.  I can see, on a hot summer afternoon, the great curve of that beautiful bay, bounded at either extremity by headlands, bathed in soft blue haze. I can see the cliffs and chines and sands basking, like myself, in the sun.  On my right, the jagged outline of a ruined sea-girt castle stands out like a sentinel betwixt is land and water.  On my left I can detect the fishermen's white cottages crouching beneath the crags.  I can see the long golden strip of strand beyond; and, farther still, across the wide estuary of the Wraythe, the line of shadowy cliffs that extend like a rugged wall out to the dim promontory of Shargle Head.  Above all, I can see again the sea, bluer even than the blue sky overhead; and as it tumbles languidly in from the horizon, fringing the amphitheatre of the bay with its edge of sparkling white, my ears can catch the murmur of its solemn music as they heard it in those days long gone by.  Well I remember, too, the same bay and the same sea; but oh, how changed!  Far as the eye could reach the great white waves charged towards the land, one upon another, furious and headlong; below us they thundered and lashed and rushed back upon their fellows, till we who watched could not hear so much as our own voices.  In the distance they leapt savagely at the base of the now lowering headlands, and fought madly over the hidden rocks and sands.  They sent their sleet and foam-flakes before them, blinding us where we stood on the cliff-top; they seethed and boiled in the hollows of the rocks, and over the river bar they dashed and plunged till far up the stream their fury scarcely spent itself.  At such times no ship or boat ventured willingly into Colveston Bay; or if it did, it rarely, if ever, left it again.  But such times were rare--very rare with us.  Indeed, I had been months at Parkhurst before I witnessed a real storm, and months again before I saw another.  So that my acquaintance with the bay was almost altogether connected with its milder aspects, and as such it appeared both fascinating and tempting.  It was on a beautiful August holiday morning that four of us were lounging lazily in a boat down at the bar mouth, looking out into the bay and watching the progress of a little fishing smack, which was skipping lightly over the bright waves in the direction of Shargle Head. Her sails gleamed in the sunlight, and she herself skimmed so lightly across the waters, and bounded so merrily through their sparkling ripples, that she seemed more like a fairy craft than a real yacht of boards and canvas.  \"I'd give a good deal to be in her!\" exclaimed Hall, one of our party, a sea captain's"]]]
