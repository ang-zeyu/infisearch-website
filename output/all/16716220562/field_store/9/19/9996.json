We should never have found the trap, but one of my men felt one of the corners of the floor give under his feet.\"  The two men said nothing.  \"Another thing,\" the detective went on slowly, \"is that I'm inclined to agree that Meredith did not commit suicide. We found footmarks, quite fresh, leading round to the back of the hut.\"  \"A big foot or a little foot?\" asked Jack quickly.  \"It is rather a big foot,\" said the detective, \"and it has rubber heels. We traced it to a gate at the back of your premises, and the gate has been opened recently--probably by Mr. Meredith when he came to the house. It's a queer case, Mr. Rennett.\"  \"What is the pistol?\"  \"That's new too,\" said Colhead. \"Belgian make and impossible to trace, I should imagine. You can't keep track of these Belgian weapons. You can buy them in any shop in any town in Ostend or Brussels, and I don't think it is the practice for the sellers to keep any record of the numbers.\"  \"In fact,\" said Jack quietly, \"it is the same kind of pistol that killed Bulford.\"  Colhead raised his eyebrows.  \"So it was, but wasn't it established that that was Mr. Meredith's own weapon?\"  Jack shook his head.  \"The only thing that was established was that he had seen the body and he picked up the pistol which was lying near the dead man. The shot was fired as he opened the door of Mr. Briggerland's house. Then he saw the figure on the pavement and picked up the pistol. He was in that position when Miss Briggerland, who testified against him, came out of the house and saw him.\"  The detective nodded.  \"I had nothing to do with the case,\" he said, \"but I remember seeing the weapon, and it was identical with this. I'll talk to the chief and let you know what he says about the whole affair. You'll have to give evidence at the inquest of course.\"  When he had gone the two men looked at one another.  \"Well, Rennett, do you think we're going to get into hot water, or are we going to perjure our way to safety?\"  \"There's no need for perjury, not serious perjury,\" said the other carefully. \"By the way, Jack, where was Briggerland the night Bulford was murdered?\"  \"When Miss Jean Briggerland had recovered from her horror, she went upstairs and aroused her father, who, despite the early hour, was in bed and asleep. When the police came, or rather, when the detective in charge of the case arrived, which must have been some time after the policeman on point duty put in an appearance, Mr. Briggerland was discovered in a picturesque dressing gown and, I presume, no less picturesque pyjamas.\"  \"Horrified, too, I suppose,\" said Rennett dryly.  Jack was silent for a long time. Then: \"Rennett,\" he said, \"do you know I am more rattled about this girl than I am about any consequences to ourselves.\"  \"Which girl are you talking about?\"  \"About Mrs. Meredith. Whilst poor Meredith was alive she was in no particular danger. But do you realise that what were advantages from our point of view, namely, the fact that she had no relations in the world, are to-day a source of considerable peril to this unfortunate lady?\"  \"I had forgotten that,\" said Rennett thoughtfully. \"What makes matters a little more complicated, is the will which Meredith made this morning before he was married.\"  Jack whistled.  \"Did he make a will?\" he said in surprise.  His partner nodded.  \"You remember he was here with me for half an hour. Well, he insisted upon writing out a will and my wife and Bolton, the butler, witnessed it.\"  \"And he has left his money----?\"  \"To his wife absolutely,\" replied the other. \"The poor old chap was so frantically keen on keeping the money out of the Briggerland exchequer, that he was prepared to entrust the whole of his money to a girl he had not seen.\"  Jack was serious now.  \"And the Briggerlands are her heirs? Do you realise that, Rennett--there's going to be hell!\"  Mr. Rennett nodded.  \"I thought that too,\" he said quietly.  Jack sank down in a seat, his face screwed up into a hideous frown, and the elder man did not interrupt his thoughts. Suddenly Jack's face cleared and he smiled.  \"Jaggs!\" he said softly.  \"Jaggs?\" repeated his puzzled partner.  \"Jaggs,\" said Jack, nodding, \"he's the fellow. We've got to meet strategy with strategy, Rennett, and Jaggs is the boy to do it.\"  Mr. Rennett looked at him helplessly.  \"Could Jaggs get us out of our trouble too?\" he asked sarcastically.  \"He could even do that,\" replied Jack.  \"Then bring him along, for I have an idea he'll have the time of his life.\"     Chapter VII   Miss Jean Briggerland reached her home in Berkeley Street soon after nine o'clock. She did not ring, but let herself in with a key and went straight to the dining-room, where her father sat eating his breakfast, with a newspaper propped up before him.  He was the dark-skinned man whom Lydia had seen at the theatre, and he looked up over his gold-rimmed spectacles as the girl came in.  \"You have been out very early,\" he said.  She did not reply, but slowly divesting herself of her sable coat she threw it on to a chair, took off the toque that graced her shapely head, and flung it after the coat. Then she drew out a chair, and sat down at the table, her chin on her palms, her blue eyes fixed upon her parent.  Nature had so favoured her that her face needed no artificial embellishment--the skin was clear and fine of texture, and the cold morning had brought only a faint pink to the beautiful face.  \"Well, my dear,\" Mr. Briggerland looked up and beamed through his glasses, \"so poor Meredith has committed suicide?\"  She did not speak, keeping her eyes fixed on him.  \"Very sad, very sad,\" Mr. Briggerland shook his head.  \"How did it happen?\" she asked quietly.  Mr. Briggerland shrugged his shoulders.  \"I suppose at the sight of you he bolted back to his hiding place where--er--had been located by--er--interested persons during the night, then seeing me by the shed--he committed the rash and fatal act. Somehow I thought he would run back to his dug-out.\"  \"And you were prepared for him?\" she said.  He smiled.  \"A clear case of suicide, my dear,\" he said.  \"Shot through the left temple, and the pistol was found in his right hand,\" said the girl.  Mr. Briggerland started.  \"Damn it,\" he said. \"Who noticed that?\"  \"That good-looking young lawyer, Glover.\"  \"Did the police notice?\"  \"I suppose they did when Glover called their attention to the fact,\" said the girl.  Mr. Briggerland took off his glasses and wiped them.  \"It was done in such a hurry--I had to get back through the garden gate to join the police. When I got there, I found they'd been attracted by the shot and had entered the house. Still, nobody would know I was in the garden, and anyway my association with the capture of an escaped convict would not get into the newspapers.\"  \"But a case of suicide would,\" said the girl. \"Though I don't suppose the police will give away the person who informed them that James Meredith would be at Dulwich Grange.\"  Mr. Briggerland sat back in his chair, his thick lips pursed, and he was not a beautiful sight.  \"One can't remember everything,\" he grumbled.  He rose from his chair, went to the door, and locked it. Then he crossed to a bureau, pulled open a drawer and took out a small revolver. He threw out the cylinder, glanced along the barrel and the chambers to make sure it was not loaded, then clicked it back in position, and standing before a glass, he endeavoured, the pistol in his right hand, to bring the muzzle to bear on his left temple. He found this impossible, and signified his annoyance with a grunt. Then he tried the pistol with his thumb on the trigger and his hand clasping the back of the butt. Here he was more successful.  \"That's it,\" he said with satisfaction. \"It could have been done that way.\"  She did not shudder at the dreadful sight, but watched him with the keenest interest, her chin still in the palm of her hand. He might have been explaining a new way of serving a tennis ball, for all the emotion he evoked.  Mr. Briggerland came back to the table, toyed with a piece of toast and buttered it leisurely.  \"Everybody is going to Cannes this year,\" he said, \"but I think I shall stick to Monte Carlo. There is a quiet about Monte Carlo which is very restful, especially if one can get a villa on the hill away from the railway. I told Morden yesterday to take the new car across and meet us at Boulogne. He says that the new body is exquisite. There is a micraphonic attachment for telephoning to the driver, the electrical heating apparatus is splendid and----\"  \"Meredith was married.\"  If she had thrown a bomb at him she could not have produced a more tremendous sensation. He gaped at her, and pushed himself back from the table.  \"Married?\" His voice was a squeak.  She nodded.  \"It's a lie,\" he roared. All his suavity dropped away from him, his face was distorted and puckered with anger and grew a shade darker. \"Married, you lying little beast! He couldn't have been married! It was only a few minutes after eight, and the parson didn't come till nine. I'll break your neck if you try to scare me! I've told you about that before....\"  He raved on, and she listened unmoved.  \"He was married at eight o'clock by a man they brought down from Oxford, and who stayed the night in the house,\" she repeated with great calmness. \"There's no sense in lashing yourself into a rage. I've seen the bride, and spoken to the clergyman.\"  From the bullying, raging madman, he became a whimpering, pitiable thing. His chin trembled, the big hands he laid on the tablecloth shook with a fever.  \"What are we going to do?\" he wailed. \"My God, Jean, what are we going to do?\"  She rose and went to the sideboard, poured out a stiff dose of brandy from a decanter and brought it across to him without a word. She was used to these tantrums, and to their inevitable ending. She was neither hurt, surprised, nor disgusted. This pale, ethereal being was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],["title","The Angel of Terror (#6)"],["body","dominant partner of the combination. Nerves she did not possess, fears she did not know. She had acquired the precise sense of a great surgeon in whom pity was a detached emotion, and one which never intruded itself into the operating chamber. She was no more phenomenal than they, save that she did not feel bound by the conventions and laws which govern them as members of an ordered society. It requires no greater nerve to slay than to cure. She had had that matter out with herself, and had settled it to her own satisfaction.  \"You will have to put off your trip to Monte Carlo,\" she said, as he drank the brandy greedily.  \"We've lost everything now,\" he stuttered, \"everything.\"  \"This girl has no relations,\" said the daughter steadily. \"Her heirs-at-law are ourselves.\"  He put down the glass, and looked at her, and became almost immediately his old self.  \"My dear,\" he said admiringly, \"you are really wonderful. Of course, it was childish of me. Now what do you suggest?\"  \"Unlock that door,\" she said in a low voice, \"I want to call the maid.\"  As he walked to the door, she pressed the footbell, and soon after the faded woman who attended her came into the room.  \"Hart,\" she said, \"I want you to find my emerald ring, the small one, the little pearl necklet, and the diamond scarf pin. Pack them carefully in a box with cotton wool.\"  \"Yes, madam,\" said the woman, and went out.  \"Now what are you going to do, Jean?\" asked her father.  \"I am returning them to Mrs. Meredith,\" said the girl coolly. \"They were presents given to me by her husband, and I feel after this tragic ending of my dream that I can no longer bear the sight of them.\"  \"He didn't give you those things, he gave you the chain. Besides, you are throwing away good money?\"  \"I know he never gave them to me, and I am not throwing away good money,\" she said patiently. \"Mrs. Meredith will return them, and she will give me an opportunity of throwing a little light upon James Meredith, an opportunity which I very much desire.\"  Later she went up to her pretty little sitting-room on the first floor, and wrote a letter.       \"_Dear Mrs. Meredith.--I am sending you the few trinkets which      James gave to me in happier days. They are all that I have of      his, and you, as a woman, will realise that whilst the      possession of them brings me many unhappy memories, yet they      have been a certain comfort to me. I wish I could dispose of      memory as easily as I send these to you (for I feel they are      really your property) but more do I wish that I could recall      and obliterate the occasion which has made Mr. Glover so bitter      an enemy of mine._       \"_Thinking over the past, I see that I was at fault, but I know      that you will sympathise with me when the truth is revealed to      you. A young girl, unused to the ways of men, perhaps I      attached too much importance to Mr. Glover's attentions, and      resented them too crudely. In those days I thought it was      unpardonable that a man who professed to be poor James's best      friend, should make love to his fiancée, though I suppose that      such things happen, and are endured by the modern girl. A man      does not readily forgive a woman for making him feel a fool--it      is the one unpardonable offence that a girl can commit.      Therefore, I do not resent his enmity as much as you might      think. Believe me, I feel for you very much in these trying      days. Let me say again that I hope your future will be      bright._\"  She blotted the letter, put it in an envelope, and addressed it, and taking down a book from one of the well-stocked shelves, drew her chair to the fire, and began reading.  Mr. Briggerland came in an hour after, looked over her shoulder at the title, and made a sound of disapproval.  \"I can't understand your liking for that kind of book,\" he said.  The book was one of the two volumes of \"Chronicles of Crime,\" and she looked up with a smile.  \"Can't you? It's very easily explained. It is the most encouraging work in my collection. Sit down for a minute.\"  \"A record of vulgar criminals,\" he growled. \"Their infernal last dying speeches, their processions to Tyburn--phaugh!\"  She smiled again, and looked down at the book. The wide margins were covered with pencilled notes in her writing.  \"They're a splendid mental exercise,\" she said. \"In every case I have written down how the criminal might have escaped arrest, but they were all so vulgar, and so stupid. Really the police of the time deserve no credit for catching them. It is the same with modern criminals....\"  She went to the shelf, and took down two large scrap-books, carried them across to the fire, and opened one on her knees.  \"Vulgar and stupid, every one of them,\" she repeated, as she turned the leaves rapidly.  \"The clever ones get caught at times,\" said Briggerland gloomily.  \"Never,\" she said, and closed the book with a snap. \"In England, in France, in America, and in almost every civilised country, there are murderers walking about to-day, respected by their fellow citizens. Murderers, of whose crimes the police are ignorant. Look at these.\" She opened the book again. \"Here is the case of Rell, who poisons a troublesome creditor with weed-killer. Everybody in the town knew he bought the weed-killer; everybody knew that he was in debt to this man. What chance had he of escaping? Here's Jewelville--he kills his wife, buries her in the cellar, and then calls attention to himself by running away. Here's Morden, who kills his sister-in-law for the sake of her insurance money, and who also buys the poison in broad daylight, and is found with a bottle in his pocket. Such people deserve hanging.\"  \"I wish to heaven you wouldn't talk about hanging,\" said Briggerland tremulously, \"you're inhuman, Jean, by God--\"  \"I'm an angel,\" she smiled, \"and I have press cuttings to prove it! The _Daily Recorder_ had half a column on my appearance in the box at Jim's trial.\"  He looked over toward the writing-table, saw the letter, and picked it up.  \"So you've written to the lady. Are you sending her the jewels?\"  She nodded.  He looked at her quickly.  \"You haven't been up to any funny business with them, have you?\" he asked suspiciously, and she smiled.  \"My dear parent,\" drawled Jean Briggerland, \"after my lecture on the stupidity of the average criminal, do you imagine I should do anything so _gauche_?\"     Chapter VIII   \"And now, Mrs. Meredith,\" said Jack Glover, \"what are you going to do?\"  He had spent the greater part of the morning with the new heiress, and Lydia had listened, speechless, as he recited a long and meaningless list of securities, of estates, of ground rents, balances and the like, which she had inherited.  \"What am I going to do?\" she said, shaking her head, hopelessly. \"I don't know. I haven't the slightest idea, Mr. Glover. It is so bewildering. Do I understand that all this property is mine?\"  \"Not yet,\" said Jack with a smile, \"but it is so much yours that on the strength of the will we are willing to advance you money to almost any extent. The will has to be proved, and probate must be taken, but when these legal formalities are settled, and we have paid the very heavy death duties, you will be entitled to dispose of your fortune as you wish. As a matter of fact,\" he added, \"you could do that now. At any rate, you cannot live here in Brinksome Street, and I have taken the liberty of hiring a furnished flat on your behalf. One of our clients has gone away to the Continent and left the flat for me to dispose of. The rent is very low, about twenty guineas a week.\"  \"Twenty guineas a week!\" gasped the horrified girl, \"why, I can't----\"  And then she realised that she \"could.\"  Twenty guineas a week was as nothing to her. This fact more than anything else, brought her to an understanding of her fortune.  \"I suppose I had better move,\" she said dubiously. \"Mrs. Morgan is giving up this house, and she asked me whether I had any plans. I think she'd be willing to come as my housekeeper.\"  \"Excellent,\" nodded Jack. \"You'll want a maid as well and, of course, you will have to put up Jaggs for the nights.\"  \"Jaggs?\" she said in astonishment.  \"Jaggs,\" repeated Jack solemnly. \"You see, Miss--I beg your pardon, Mrs. Meredith, I'm rather concerned about you, and I want you to have somebody on hand I can rely on, sleeping in your flat at night. I dare say you think I am an old woman,\" he said as he saw her smile, \"and that my fears are groundless, but you will agree that your own experience of last week will support the theory that anything may happen in London.\"  \"But really, Mr. Glover, you don't mean that I am in any serious danger--from whom?\"  \"From a lot of people,\" he said diplomatically.  \"From poor Miss Briggerland?\" she challenged, and his eyes narrowed.  \"Poor Miss Briggerland,\" he said softly. \"She certainly is poorer than she expected to be.\"  \"Nonsense,\" scoffed the girl. She was irritated, which was unusual in her. \"My dear Mr. Glover, why do you pursue your vendetta against her? Do you think it is playing the game, honestly now? Isn't it a case of wounded vanity on your part?\"  He stared at her in astonishment.  \"Wounded vanity? Do you mean pique?\"  She nodded.  \"Why should I be piqued?\" he asked slowly.  \"You know best,\" replied Lydia, and then a light dawned on him.  \"Have I been making love to Miss Briggerland by any chance?\" he asked.  \"You know best,\" she repeated.  \"Good Lord!\" and then he began to laugh, and she thought he would never stop.  \"I suppose I made love to her, and she was angry because I dared to commit such an act of treachery to her fiancé! Yes, that was it. I made love to her behind poor Jim's back, and she 'ticked me off,' and that's why I'm so annoyed with her?\"  \"You have a very good memory,\" said Lydia, with a scornful little smile.  \"My memory isn't as good as Miss Briggerland's power of invention,\" said Jack. \"Doesn't it strike you, Mrs. Meredith,"]]]
