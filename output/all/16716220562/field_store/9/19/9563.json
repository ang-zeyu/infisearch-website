As they talked, the light in the windows disappeared, for \"Dinky,\" the church sexton, was in a hurry to get around to Matty's stationery store to complete his humdrum but patriotic duty of throwing up a wooden railing to keep the throng in line in the morning.  \"The screw driver is mightier than the sword, hey, Dink?\" called the irrepressible Roy, as Dinky hurried away into the darkness.  \"All I wanted to say, Tom,\" said Mr. Ellsworth soberly, \"is just this: let me do your thinking for you--even your patriotic thinking--for the time being. Do you get me? Don't run off and do anything foolish.\"  \"Is it foolish to fight for your country?\" asked Tom doggedly.  \"It might be,\" retorted the scoutmaster, nothing daunted.  \"I'm not going to stay here and see people drowned by submarines,\" muttered Tom.  \"You won't see them drowned by submarines as long as you stay here, Tomasso,\" said Roy mischievously. He loved to make game of Tom's clumsy speech.  \"You know what I mean,\" said Tom; \"I ain't going to be a slacker for anybody.\"  \"You might as well say that President Wilson is a slacker because he doesn't go off and enlist in some regiment,\" said Mr. Ellsworth; \"or that Papa Joffre is a coward because he doesn't waste his time with a rifle in the trenches.\"  \"Gee whiz, you can't say _he's_ a coward,\" exclaimed Pee-wee, \"because I saw him!\"  \"Of course, that proves he isn't a coward,\" said Roy slyly.  \"There's going to be work, and a whole lot of it, for every one to do, Tom,\" continued Mr. Ellsworth pleasantly. \"There is going to be work for old men and young men, for women and girls and boys--and scouts. And being a slacker consists in not doing the work which you ought to do. If a girl has a flower bed where she might grow tomatoes, and she grows roses there instead, you might call _her_ a slacker.  \"The officials in Washington who have this tremendous burden on their shoulders have told us what _we_, as scouts (Mr. Ellsworth always called himself a scout), ought to do. They have outlined a program for us. Now if you run off and join the army in the hope of doing a man's work, why then some man has got to knuckle down and do your work. See?\"  \"I'm sick of boring holes in sticks,\" grunted Tom.  \"Well, I dare say you are. I never said it was as pleasant as eating ice cream. What I say is that we must all knuckle down and do what we can do best to help defend Old Glory. And we can't always choose our work for ourselves. I'm going to stay here, for the present, at least, and keep you scouts busy. And I don't consider that I'm a slacker either. If you all stand by me and help, I can be of more service right here, just now, than I could be if I went away.\"  \"Then why does the government have posters out all around, urging fellers to join the army?\" said Tom, unconvinced.  \"There are fellers and fellers,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, mimicking Tom's pronunciation of the word, \"and what is best for one isn't necessarily best for another. These posters are for fellows older than you, as you know perfectly well. I'm talking now of what is best for _you_--at present. Won't you trust me? If you can't obey and trust your scoutmaster, you couldn't obey and trust your captain and your general.\"  \"I never said I didn't,\" said Tom.  \"Well, then, leave it to me. When the time comes for you to join the army, I'll tell you so, and I'll shout it so loud that you can't make any mistake. Meanwhile, put aside all that idea and knuckle down and help. You're just as much with the colors now as if you were in the trenches.... You'll be on hand early to-morrow?\"  \"I s'pose so,\" said Tom sullenly.  Mr. Ellsworth looked at him steadily. No doubt it was something in Tom's grudging manner that made him apprehensive, but perhaps too as he looked at the boy who had been growing up before his eyes in the past two years, he realized as he had not realized before that Tom had come to be a pretty fine specimen and could stand unconcerned, as he certainly would, at the most rigid and exacting physical test.  When Tom's rapid growth had brought the inevitable advent of long trousers, arousing the unholy mirth of Roy Blakeley and others, Mr. Ellsworth had experienced a jarring realization that the process had begun whereby his scouts would soon begin slipping away from him.  He had compromised with Time by making Tom a sort of assistant scoutmaster and encouraging Connie Bennett to work into Tom's place as leader of the Elk Patrol; and he had lived in continual dread lest Tom (who might be counted on for anything) discover his own size, as it were, and get the notion in his stubborn head that he was too big to be a scout at all.  But Tom had thought too much of the troop and of the Elks for that, and a new cause of apprehension for Mr. Ellsworth had arisen which now showed in every line of his face as he looked at Tom.  \"I want you to promise me, Tom, that you won't try to enlist without my permission. If you'll say that and obey Rule Seven the same as you have always obeyed it, I'll be satisfied.\"  \"How about Rule Ten?\" said Tom, in his usual dogged, half-hearted manner; \"a scout has got to be brave, he's got to face danger, he's----\"  \"You notice Rule Seven comes before Rule Ten,\" snapped Mr. Ellsworth. \"They put them in the order of their importance. The men who made the Handbook knew what they were about. The question is just whether you're going to continue to respect Rule Seven, that's all.\"  Mr. Ellsworth knew how to handle Tom.  \"Yes, I am,\" Tom said reluctantly.  \"Then that's all there is to it. Give me your hand, Tom.\"  Tom put out his hand, and as the scoutmaster shook it his manner relaxed into the usual off-hand way which the scouts so liked and which had made him so popular among them.  \"President Wilson wasn't in any great rush about going to war, and I don't want you to be in a hurry to get into a uniform. You're in a uniform already, if it comes to that. And the Secretary of War says our little old scout khaki is going to make itself felt. I'd be the last to preach slacking, and when it's time, if the time comes, I'll tell you.... You know, Tom,\" he added ruefully, \"you're getting to be such a fine, strapping fellow that it makes me afraid you'd get away with it if you tried. I don't like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20986"],["title","Tom Slade with the Colors (#1)"],["body"," see you so big, Tom----\"  \"Don't you care,\" said Pee-wee soothingly, \"I'm small still.\"  \"If you were old enough, I wouldn't say anything against it,\" Mr. Ellsworth added. \"But you're not, Tom. Some people don't seem to think there's anything wrong in a boy's lying about his age to get into the army. But I do, and I think you do---- Don't you?\" he added anxiously.  \"Y-e-es.\"  \"Of course, you couldn't enlist without Mr. Temple's consent, he being your guardian, unless you lied--and I know you wouldn't do that.\"  \"You didn't catch me in many, did you?\"  \"I never caught you in _any_, Tom.\"  \"Well, then----\"  \"Well, then,\" concluded Mr. Ellsworth, \"I guess we'd all better go home and get some sleep. We've got one strenuous day to-morrow.\"  \"It's going to be a peach,\" said Roy, looking up at the stars. As they started to move away, Mr. Ellsworth instinctively extended his hand to Tom again.  \"I have your promise, then?\" said he.  \"Y-e-s.\"  \"I'm not stuck on that 'yes.'\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom, more briskly.  \"That you won't do anything along that line till you consult me?\"  \"Don't do anything till you count ten,\" said Roy.  \"Make it ten thousand,\" said Mr. Ellsworth.  \"And after you've counted ten,\" put in Pee-wee, \"if you decide to go, I'll go with you, by crinkums!\"  \"Go-o-d-night!\" laughed Roy. \"That ought to be enough to keep you at home, Tomasso!\"  Tom smiled, half grudgingly, as he turned and started toward home.  \"You don't think he'd really enlist, do you?\" queried Roy, as he and Pee-wee and Mr. Ellsworth sauntered up the street.  \"He won't now,\" said the scoutmaster. \"I have his promise.\"  \"Otherwise, do you think he would?\"  \"I think it extremely likely.\"  \"And lie about his age?\"  Mr. Ellsworth screwed his face into a funny, puzzled look. \"There's a good deal of that kind of thing going on,\" he said, \"and I sometimes think the recruiting people wink at it, or perhaps they are just a little too ready to judge by physical appearance. Look how Billy Wade got through.\"  \"He doesn't look eighteen,\" said Roy.  \"Of course he doesn't. But he told them he was 'going on nineteen,' and so he was--just the same as Pee-wee is going on fifty.\"  Roy laughed.  \"The honor of enlisting, the willingness to sacrifice one's life, seems to cover a multitude of sins in the eyes of some people,\" said the scoutmaster. \"Heroic duty done for one's country will wipe out a lot of faults.--It's hard to get a line on Tom's thoughts. He asked me the other day what I thought about the saying, _To do a great right, do a little wrong._ I don't know where he rooted it out, but it gave me a shudder when he asked me.\"  \"He was standing in front of the recruiting station down at the postoffice yesterday,\" said Roy, \"staring at the posters. Goodness only knows what he was thinking about. He came along with me when he saw me.\"  \"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ellsworth thoughtfully.  \"But I guess he wouldn't try anything like that here--the town is too small,\" said Roy. \"Even the recruiting fellow knows him.\"  \"Yes; but what worries me,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"is when he goes to the city and stands around listening to the orators and watches the young fellows surging into the recruiting places. That phrase, _Your country needs you_, is dinging in his ears.\"  \"He'd get through in a walk,\" said Roy.  \"That's just the trouble,\" Mr. Ellsworth mused. \"Tom would never do anything that he thought wrong,\" he added, after a pause; \"but he has a way of doping things out for himself, and sometimes he asks queer questions.\"  \"Well, he promised you, anyway,\" said Roy finally.  \"Oh, yes, that settles it,\" Mr. Ellsworth said. \"All's well that ends well.\"  \"We should worry,\" said Roy, in his usual light-hearted manner.  \"That's just what I _shan't_ do,\" the scoutmaster answered.  \"All right, so long, see you later,\" Roy called, as he started up Blakeley's hill.  Mr. Ellsworth and Pee-wee waved him goodnight. Presently Pee-wee deserted and went down, scout pace, through Main Street, laboriously hoisting his belt axe up with every other step. It was very heavy and a great nuisance to his favorite gait, but he had worn it regularly to scout meeting ever since war had been declared.     CHAPTER II  \"BULL HEAD\" AND \"BUTTER FINGERS\"   The lateness of the hour did not incline Tom to hurry on his journey homeward. He was thoroughly discouraged and dissatisfied with himself, and it pleased his mood to amble along kicking a stone in front of him until he lost it in the darkness. Without this vent to his distemper he became still more sullen. It would have been better if he had hunted up the stone and gone on kicking it. But now he was angry at the stone too. He was angry at everybody and everything.  Ever since war had been declared Tom had worked with the troop, doing his bit under Mr. Ellsworth's supervision, and everything he had done he had done wrong--in his own estimation.  The Red Cross bandages which he had rolled had had to be rolled over again. The seeds which he had planted had not come up, because he had buried them instead of planting them. Roy's onion plants were peeping coyly forth in the troop's patriotic garden; Doc Carson's lettuce was showing the proper spirit; a little regiment of humble radishes was mobilizing under the loving care of Connie Bennett, and Pee-wee's tomatoes were bold with flaunting blossoms. A bashful cucumber which basked unobtrusively in the wetness of the ice-box outlet under the shed at Artie Van Arlen's home was growing apace. But not a sign was there of Tom's beans or peas or beets--nothing in his little allotted patch but a lonely plantain which he had carefully nursed until Pee-wee had told him the bitter truth--that this child of his heart was nothing but a vulgar weed.  It is true that Roy Blakeley had tried to comfort Tom by telling him that if his seeds did not come up in Bridgeboro they might come up in China, for they were as near to one place as the other! Tom had not been comforted.  His most notable failure, however, had come this very week when three hundred formidable hickory sticks had been received by the Home Defense League and turned over to the Scouts to have holes bored through them for the leather thongs.  There had been a special scout meeting for this work; every scout had come equipped with a gimlet, and there was such a boring seance as had never been known before. Roy had said it was a great bore. As fast as the holes were bored, Pee-wee had tied the strips of leather through them, and the whole job had been finished in the one evening.  Tom had broken his gimlet and three extra ones which fortunately some one had brought. The hickory had proven as stubborn as he was himself--which is saying a great deal.  He had tried boring from each side so that the holes would meet in the middle; but the holes never met. When he had bored all the way through from one side, he had either broken the gimlet or the hole had come slantingways and the gimlet had come out, like a woodchuck in his burrow, where it had least been expected to appear.  And now, to cap the climax, he was to stand outside one of the registration places the next day and pin little flags on the young men as they came out after registering. The other members of the troop were to be distributed all through the county for this purpose (wherever there was no local scout troop), and each scout, or group of scouts, would sally heroically forth in the morning armed with a shoebox full of these honorable mementoes, made by the girls of Bridgeboro.  And meanwhile, thought Tom, the Germans were sinking our ships and dropping bombs on hospitals and hitting below the belt, generally. He was not at all satisfied with himself, or with his trifling, ineffective part in the great war. He felt that he had made a bungle of everything so far, and his mind turned contemptuously from these inglorious duties in which he had been engaged to the more heroic rôle of the real soldier.  Perhaps his long trousers had had something to do with his dissatisfaction; in any event, they made his bungling seem the more ridiculous. His fellow scouts had called him \"bull head\" and \"butter fingers,\" but only in good humor and because they loved to jolly him; for in plain fact they all knew and admitted that Tom Slade, former hoodlum, was the best all-round scout that ever raised his hand and promised to do his duty to God and Country and to obey the Scout Law.  The fact was that Tom was clumsy and rough--perhaps a little uncouth--and he could do big things but not little things.  As he ambled along the dark street, nursing his disgruntled mood, he came to Rockwood Place and turned into it, though it did not afford him the shortest way home. But in his sullen mood one street was as good as another, and Rockwood Place had that fascination for him which wealth and luxury always had for poor Tom.  Three years before, when Tom Slade, hoodlum, had been deserted by his wretched, drunken father and left a waif in Bridgeboro, Mr. Ellsworth had taken him in hand, Roy had become his friend, and John Temple, president of the Bridgeboro Bank, noticing his amazing reformation, had become interested in him and in the Boy Scouts as well.  It had proven a fine thing for Tom and for the Scouts. Mr. Temple had endowed a large scout camp in the Catskills, which had become a vacation spot for troops from far and near, and which, during the two past summers, had been the scene of many lively adventures for the Bridgeboro boys.  But Tom had to thank Temple Camp and its benevolent founder for something more than health and recreation and good times. When the troop had returned from that delightful woodland community in the preceding autumn and Tom had reached the dignity of long trousers, the question of what he should do weighed somewhat heavily on Mr. Ellsworth's mind, for Tom was through school and it was necessary that he be established in some sort of home and in some form of work which would enable him to pay his way."]]]
