Get out of my cherry tree!\"  By this time feathered neighbors of the Wren family were arriving from all directions. They didn't hesitate to call Miss Kitty Cat names. And some of them even darted quite near her, as if they meant to peck her eyes out.  Miss Kitty began to have a worried look.  \"Goodness! Where do they all live?\" she asked herself. \"I had no idea there were so many birds around here. There's better hunting than I supposed.\"  Try as they would, the birds couldn't budge Miss Kitty Cat from the top of Rusty's house. He was frantic, poor fellow!  \"I don't know what to do,\" he wailed. \"My wife will starve in there--and the children, too.\"  Just then little Mr. Chippy came hurrying up to him.  \"Don't worry!\" Mr. Chippy cried. \"He's coming! He's on the way now; and he can get you out of your trouble if anybody can.\"  Miss Kitty Cat pricked up her ears. She couldn't help hearing what Mr. Chippy said.  \"I shall stay right where I am,\" she declared. \"Nobody can make me move.\"  She had scarcely finished speaking when a most unexpected sound startled her.  It was \"_Meaow!_\"     XIV  CATCALLS   PERCHED on top of Rusty Wren's tin house, Miss Kitty Cat had been enjoying herself thoroughly, while the birds made a great how-dy-do and tried in vain to frighten her away.  When she heard all at once an unexpected _meaow_ she showed that it startled her.  \"A cat!\" cried Miss Kitty. \"I didn't suppose there was another cat for miles around.\" She looked about on all sides, on the ground and in the tree-tops. And there was no cat anywhere in sight.  Meanwhile the birds were all exclaiming, \"There! He's here. Now Miss Kitty Cat had better watch out.\"  Again a strange, mocking catcall sounded from somewhere. There was a sort of jeer about it that aroused Miss Kitty Cat's anger.  \"He's come, has he?\" she exclaimed to little Mr. Chippy, who chattered at her from a good, safe distance. \"If he's looking for a fight I'd be pleased to have him come and get it.\"  Whoever the stranger was, and wherever he was, he knew how to tease Miss Kitty Cat. Now he howled at her from the thicket of lilac bushes on the edge of the flower garden. Now he mewed at her from the hedge in front of the farmhouse. And though Miss Kitty Cat tried to get a glimpse of him, she couldn't see anything that even faintly resembled a cat.  The annoying cries moved from one place to another. She was sure of that. But the one that made them managed to stay hidden.  \"This is queer!\" Miss Kitty Cat said to herself. \"Can it be that there's a cat's voice around here, and nothing more? A cat without a voice wouldn't be so strange. But a voice without a cat--that's the oddest thing I ever heard of!\"  At last Rusty Wren seemed to take heart. And his wife, inside their house, abused Miss Kitty Cat loudly--or as loudly as she could from inside the tin syrup can.  \"I always knew you were a coward,\" she told Miss Kitty. \"You're always ready to attack us small people. But you don't dare fight anybody of your own size.\"  \"How can I fight a person that I can't see?\" Miss Kitty asked. \"If this noisy stranger would come out in the open I'd soon show you whether I'd fight him or not. I'd teach him--if I could get hold of him--not to come here and interfere when I'm making a neighborly call.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Mrs. Wren. \"You don't mean half you say. If you weren't a fraud you'd go and find this person that's jeering at you.\"  _\"Meaow-ow-ow!\"_ Again that mocking call grated on Miss Kitty's ears.  \"There!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed. \"There it is again. It would make me pretty angry to be talked to like that. But I don't suppose it bothers you. Probably you're used to having people caterwaul at you.\"  That was a little more than Miss Kitty Cat could stand. She scrambled down from the old cherry tree and ran across the yard to the row of currant bushes, whence the last catcalls had come.  As she drew near, a slim slate-colored bird gave a harsh laugh as he flew up from the bushes. It was Mr. Catbird. And Miss Kitty Cat felt sheepish enough when she saw him. She knew that he had succeeded in fooling her with his mocking cries.  The birds--with Mr. Catbird among them, and Mrs. Wren, too--all gathered round Miss Kitty and made such a clamor that she crept away and hid in the haymow. She never could endure much noise, unless she made most of it herself--by the light Of the moon.     XV  MOUSETRAPS   \"I DON'T understand,\" said old dog Spot to Miss Kitty Cat one day, \"why Mrs. Green wants to keep you around the house when she can buy mousetraps at the village.\" Old Spot eyed Miss Kitty slyly. He dearly loved to watch her whiskers bristle and her tail grow big. And he could make both those things happen almost any time he wanted to.  If anybody wished to see Miss Kitty Cat turn up her nose he had only to mention mousetraps. Of all worthless junk she thought they were the worst.  \"They can't catch any but the dull-witted mice,\" she used to say. \"A mouse that knows anything won't go near a trap unless he's hungry. If he wants to go to a little trouble to get a piece of stale cheese he can usually spring the trap without getting caught in it--even if he has to use his tail to do it.\"  \"But a mousetrap,\" Spot objected, \"is little or no care. One doesn't have to feed it except when he wants it to catch a mouse. And everybody knows that Mrs. Green feeds you several times a day. Besides, the fewer mice you catch, the more food she has to waste on you.\"  \"Rubbish!\" Miss Kitty Cat sniffed. \"You eat ten times as much as I do. And I never heard of your catching a mouse, either.\"  \"Ah!\" said Spot. \"Don't forget that I drive the cows and watch the house and the barns at night. And during my spare moments I hunt woodchucks. You couldn't expect a person of my importance to fritter away his valuable time catching mice. Mousetraps couldn't do my work,\" old dog Spot continued. \"There never was a mousetrap made that could drive a cow.\"  \"That's one reason why I don't like them,\" said Miss Kitty Cat. \"They're not only poor at catching mice, but they're useless at anything else. Now, whenever I capture a mouse I always make matters as pleasant as possible for, him. I always play with him for as long a time as I can spare. But a trap just goes _snap_! A trap doesn't seem to _want_ to make friends with anybody.\"  Old dog Spot laughed right in Miss Kitty's face.  \"Much you care for your friends the mice!\" he chuckled. \"And much they care for you! If you knew what they call you, you'd be pretty angry.\"  \"What's that?\" Miss Kitty demanded.  \"I don't want to tell you,\" said Spot. \"I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" He knew (the rogue) that he could tease Miss Kitty more by leaving her to wonder what name the mice had for her.  Much as she wanted to know it, Miss Kitty Cat was too proud and haughty to ask him again. And, jumping up suddenly, she walked stiffly away.  \"I shall have to find a mouse somewhere,\" she muttered under her breath. \"I shall have to find a mouse somewhere and make him tell me what old Spot won't.\"     XVI  A MIDNIGHT MEAL   DOWN in the cellar of the farmhouse a fat couple known as Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse crept out of a hole under the pantry floor and ran down a post to the cellar bottom.  \"Things have come to a pretty pass!\" Mr. Mouse grumbled. \"Mrs. Green never did leave more than a crumb or two in the pantry where a fellow could get it. And since Miss Snooper came to live here there's less to eat than ever.\"  Mrs. Mouse nodded her head somewhat dolefully.  \"Do you remember, Moses,\" she said to her husband, \"what delicious bits of stale cheese Mrs. Green used to serve for us here in the cellar, stuck on a short piece of wire? To be sure, she was somewhat thoughtless--the way she left that dangerous loop caught back, so it would snap over and catch you behind the ears if you weren't careful. But you were always very skillful at avoiding that.\"  \"Ah! Those were happy days--or, I should say, _nights_!\" Mr. Mouse exclaimed with a sigh. \"It makes me sad just to think of that fine, old, stale, moldy cheese.\"  \"I suppose Mrs. Green gives it all to that horrid Miss Snooper now,\" said Mrs. Mouse, as she climbed to a shelf and looked at the labels on several jars of jam and jelly that stood there in a row.  Moses Mouse watched her hopefully. Being quite plump, he was a bit lazy. And he did not care to scramble up to a shelf for nothing.  \"There isn't one without a cover, is there?\" he inquired.  \"No!\" his wife replied.  \"There isn't one with a little sweetness oozing down the side of it, is there?\" he asked her.  \"No!\" said Mrs. Mouse. \"Not one! I suppose Miss Snooper has licked them all clean.\"  \"That disagreeable Miss Snooper has spoiled everything for us,\" Moses Mouse declared. And for a fat gentleman he looked oddly unhappy.  \"I don't know what we'll do for our supper,\" he whined. He always whined when he was hungry.  \"There's that chunk of putty that Farmer Green left in the woodshed,\" his wife reminded him.  \"Ugh!\" Moses Mouse made a wry face. \"We've dined upon that for the last three nights. And I never did like putty, anyhow. I wish that snooping Miss Snooper had to eat it.\" His mournful eyes roved about the cellar until they rested on something in a dark corner. \"What's in that box over there?\" he asked Mrs. Mouse.  \"I don't know,\" she answered.  \"Well--go and see, then!\" he snapped. \"I'm so faint I can scarcely stand.\"  Mrs. Mouse always humored Moses when he was hungry. She knew that he was never fretful after he had eaten a good meal. So her feet twinkled across the cellar floor and she disappeared inside the box.  Not hearing anything from her, Moses Mouse soon grew more impatient than ever.  \"Well!\" he sang out. \"What luck!\"  \"Potatoes!\" came his wife's muffled answer, out of a full mouth. \"I declare, I forgot to call you.\"     XVII  THE EAVESDROPPER   FOR ANYBODY that was so faint, Moses Mouse ran to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],["title","The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#5)"],["body","box of potatoes very spryly. His wife was already inside it, eating.  \"I'll have my supper first,\" he announced, \"while you stay outside on the cellar bottom and watch for Miss Snooper.\"  \"I'm just as hungry as you are,\" his wife objected. \"I don't want to wait. You know you'll be a long time at your supper.\" What she really meant was that Moses Mouse would be sure to overeat.  \"Very well!\" he said. \"But don't blame me if Miss Snooper sneaks up on us.\"  Thereupon Moses Mouse fell to right greedily. Although there were delicacies that he liked more than raw potatoes, he was hungry enough to enjoy them--and not even ask for salt. And his wife, too, ate almost as heartily as he did. The pale moonlight, streaming through the cellar window, lighted their banquet hall with its ghostly gleams. They enjoyed the cool dampness of the place. They liked its musty smell. And Moses Mouse remarked--between mouthfuls--that they hadn't had such an elegant feast for weeks. \"It's quite like old times,\" he said.  Mrs. Mouse agreed with him. Indeed, they relished their meal so thoroughly that they forgot everything else. And if Moses Mouse hadn't happened to glance up and see two eyes gleaming at him from over the edge of the box he would have had no reason for leaving his meal unfinished. At the moment, his mouth was crammed so full of raw potato that he could scarcely say a word.  \"Miss Snooper!\" he gasped, all but choking over the words. And he vanished in a twinkling, hoping, of course, that Mrs. Mouse would take the hint and disappear too, but not waiting to see whether she managed to get away safely.  A second later Miss Kitty Cat sprang into the box. She reached out a paw and grabbed at what looked like Mrs. Mouse. But to her great disgust she found her claws clutching nothing more interesting than a small potato, with a little knob at one end that looked not unlike a head.  Miss Kitty Cat let go of her prize with a mew of disappointment. She knew that by that time Mr. and Mrs. Mouse had made their escape. And Miss Kitty soon learned how they slipped away. In one corner of the box she found a tiny hole. \"Here's where they went!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't see how I missed seeing it when I first came sniffing around this box.\"  Though she had lost a midnight supper, Miss Kitty did not feel too sad. She was too angry for that.  \"At last,\" she cried, \"I've found out what old dog Spot wouldn't tell me. The mice are calling me 'Miss Snooper' behind my back!\"  In the morning, when Miss Kitty met old dog Spot in the woodshed, she was still feeling peevish. \"What are you doing in here?\" she snapped.  \"Oh, I'm just snooping around to see what I can find for my breakfast,\" he told her with a grin.  Miss Kitty Cat bared her teeth in a snarl.  \"_Snooping!_\" she cried. \"You'd better be careful what you say to me! I heard some mice talking last night.\"  \"Ah!\" said old Spot. \"Now you know that listeners seldom hear anything good about themselves.\"  Then he decided, suddenly, that he would look elsewhere for his breakfast.  For Miss Kitty Cat was in a terrible temper.     XVIII  KIDNAPPED   THERE was great rejoicing among all the Mouse family. Pudgy Mr. Moses Mouse had picked up a bit of news that delighted him and his wife and all their many relations. Somebody had stolen Miss Snooper--as the Mouse family always called Miss Kitty Cat! Somebody had taken her away!  Master Meadow Mouse had seen it all; and he had told Moses exactly how it happened. Master Meadow Mouse knew that a wagon had borne Miss Snooper up the road and over the hill. He had watched it disappear, with his own eyes. All those things Moses Mouse repeated as fast as his short breath would permit. He had hurried back home to tell the news as soon as he had heard it. He found, however, that no one cared _how_ Miss Kitty Cat (or Miss Snooper), went, nor where; no one cared who took her; no one cared when. It was enough to know that she was gone. And everybody exclaimed that it was the best news ever--and good riddance to bad rubbish--meaning Miss Kitty Cat.  If it were only true! The Mouse family scarcely dared believe that it was. But when two days passed, and Moses Mouse himself had even ventured into the pantry, and the kitchen, and the woodshed, without meeting Miss Kitty, the Mouse family dared decide that she had indeed gone for good.         *       *       *       *       *  Meanwhile Miss Kitty Cat was having a most unhappy time. It was true that she had been stolen. A man driving a peddler's wagon up the hill one evening had noticed her as she lay on top of the stone wall, around the turn of the road beyond the farmhouse. \"Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!\" he called, as he stopped his horse. And reaching behind the seat, he brought out a bit of food, which he held out for her.  Now, it happened that at that very moment Miss Kitty Cat had her mind on food. She had been hoping that a meal would appear at any moment out of a chink in the wall. And when it was dangled right before her eyes like that she couldn't resist it. She climbed up into the wagon. And the next thing she knew the peddler had clapped her into a basket and fastened the cover. Miss Kitty Cat was a prisoner.  \"There, my beauty!\" the peddler exclaimed. \"I'll take you home with me. We need a mouser. And I dare say you're a good one. Unless I'm mistaken, you were hunting chipmunks on the wall.\"  Miss Kitty Cat made no answer. Naturally, it pleased her to be called a beauty. But there were other matters that she didn't like in the least. Her captor had forgotten to toss the scrap of meat into the basket--the bait with which he had caught her. And it was somewhat breathless inside her prison. And Miss Kitty Cat had no idea where the peddler was taking her.  He had clucked to his horse and started him plodding up the hill. Every time a wheel struck a stone Miss Kitty gritted her teeth. She never did enjoy riding in a wagon, anyhow. And this one was not at all comfortable.  \"They'll wonder, back home, what's become of me,\" she thought. \"And one thing is certain: everybody will miss me!\"     XIX  STRANGE QUARTERS   THE PEDDLER that took Miss Kitty Cat away in his cart drove long into the night. Inside the basket into which her captor had popped her, Miss Kitty kept her wits at work. She knew that there were many twists and turns as they creaked up the hills and rattled down the other side of them. Then there were level stretches where the peddler held his horse to a swinging gait that fast put long miles between them and Farmer Green's place in Pleasant Valley.  \"Dear me!\" Miss Kitty thought. \"What a tramp I'll have getting back home again!\" For already she was planning to return to the farm. She didn't care if they did need a good mouser at the stranger's house. They needed one just as much at Farmer Green's.  \"If Mrs. Green has to depend on traps to take care of the mice she'll soon be eaten out of house and home,\" Miss Kitty mused. \"The minute that fat Moses Mouse knows I'm gone he'll be as bold as brass.\"  At last the wagon left the hard road and pulled up in a dooryard. A dog barked. And Miss Kitty heard voices.  \"I've brought you something in here that you'll like,\" said the peddler as he handed Miss Kitty's basket to somebody. \"But don't look at it out of doors or it'll get away.\"  Later, inside the house, a woman let Miss Kitty out of her prison.  \"What a big cat!\" she exclaimed. \"Where did you get her?\"  \"Oh, I picked her up on the road,\" said the peddler. \"She looked as if she wanted a ride,\" he chuckled. \"I think she was hunting along an old stone wall.\"  \"She'll find hunting enough here,\" said his wife. \"This house is overrun with mice. I'll just put her down cellar and let her work for her supper.\" Then she gave Miss Kitty a toss down the cellar stairs and slammed the door behind her.  It was no wonder that Miss Kitty Cat was angry.  \"A fine way to treat a guest!\" she spluttered down there in the dark. \"That woman might have set out a little milk for me. It would have tasted good, after my long ride in that stuffy basket.\" Miss Kitty couldn't help thinking what a fine home she had had at Farmer Green's and how good Mrs. Green had always been to her.  Even Johnnie Green--though he _was_ a boy--had petted her oftener than he had pulled her tail.  But Miss Kitty was too hungry to sit long at the foot of the cellar stairs in thought.  She soon heard faint rustlings squeaks, and scratchings around her. And though she didn't care to oblige the woman upstairs in any way, Miss Kitty lost no time in providing a hearty meal for herself.  Then she lay down on an old sack and slept for a while.  And just before the roosters began to crow she had found a broken pane in a cellar window.  \"What luck!\" said Miss Kitty under her breath. And very silently she slipped through the opening and stole away.     XX  A LONG JOURNEY   BY SUNRISE Miss Kitty Cat had trotted at least a mile along the road that passed the peddler's house. She wanted to get a safe distance away before the family got up and turned loose the dog that had barked the night before, when she arrived.  Miss Kitty remembered clearly that the wagon had been climbing a long hill before it turned into the peddler's dooryard. So without hesitating she started _down_ the road. She knew that in that direction lay Pleasant Valley--and her home at Farmer Green's.  Having put the first mile of her journey behind her, Miss Kitty stopped beside a little brook and drank her fill of cool, sweet water. She was very thirsty, because she hadn't had a drink since the evening before.  A pretty wood stretched beyond the brook, tempting Miss Kitty Cat to explore it. At that hour of the morning there were many birds twittering among the trees. And spry chipmunks were frisking about in search of their breakfast. Miss Kitty Cat just naturally began to think of her own breakfast.  \"If I were at home, Mrs. Green would be setting a saucer of milk on the woodshed steps about this time,\""]]]
