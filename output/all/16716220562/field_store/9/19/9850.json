It isn't finished, but I'm not going to paint it yellow.  I'm going to paint it red first.\"  \"I don't think I shall like that,\" said the boy, shaking his head.  \"Wait and see!\" said the monk, and once more mixing up a little red with gum he carefully painted the white letter scarlet, and held it up.  \"There!\" cried the boy triumphantly; \"it looks now almost like the back patch, and you've spoiled it all.\"  \"Umph!\" grunted the monk, re-opening the window and laying his work in the sun to dry.  \"Wait a bit.\"  \"Yes, I'll wait,\" said the boy, watching the shiny wet paint turn more and more dull; \"but I don't like it.\"  Swythe washed his brush carefully again, and as soon as the paint was dry went carefully over the letter part with gum, so delicately that the red colour was not disturbed nor the background smeared.  \"Yes,\" said the boy, still watching; \"that looks a little better, because it looks shiny, but it was better white.  Do paint it yellow now.\"  \"I told you I'm going to make it yellow,\" said Swythe, laying his work well out in the sunshine to get thoroughly dry.  Then, taking it from the window-sill and shutting out the breeze again, Swythe placed his work ready and took out, from a snug corner, a tiny book made by sewing together about half-a-dozen leaves of parchment, and upon opening this very carefully Alfred saw within a piece of brilliant shining gold.  \"Oh, how beautiful!\" cried Alfred, making a dart at it with his hand. But, as if he expected this, Swythe put out his own hand and caught his pupil's just in time, creating such a breeze, though, that the very thin gold leaf rose up at the corner and fell over, doubling nearly in half.  \"There, you see how fine it is!\" cried Swythe.  \"I'm very sorry--I did not know,\" said the boy sadly; and then he looked on in wonder, for the monk bent down, gave a gentle puff with his breath, and the gold was blown up, to fall back into its place.  \"Why, I thought it would be quite hard and heavy,\" said Alfred.  \"And it's twenty times as thin as the parchment!\" said Swythe.  \"Now then, suppose we make the letter of gold.\"  Alfred did not speak, but watched with breathless interest while the monk took his knife and carefully cut a long strip off one edge of the gold leaf, and then, dividing it in four, took it up bit by bit on the blade, and laid the pieces along the letter, cutting off edges and scraps that were not wanted, and covering up bare places so carefully and with such great pains that at last there was not a trace left of the gummed letter, a rough, rugged gold one being left in its place.  \"There!\" cried Swythe, when he had covered the last speck, and all was gold leaf; but Alfred shook his head.  \"It looks very beautiful,\" he said; \"but I don't like it.  The edges are all rugged and rough.\"  \"So they are!\" replied Swythe, and, taking now a clean dry brush, he began to smoothe and dab and press gently till there was not a trace left of where the scraps of gold joined or lay one over the other, all becoming strong and perfect excepting the edges, where the gold lay loose, till, quite satisfied with his work, the monk passed his brush briskly over the letter, carrying off every scrap of gold outside the gummed letter, and leaving this clean, smooth, and glistening.  \"Oh, Father Swythe,\" cried Alfred, clapping his hands, \"you are clever! It's beautiful!\"  \"You like it, then, my boy?\" said the old man gravely.  \"You shall soon be able to do that with your light fingers.\"  The boy looked down at his hands and then took up the pen the monk had laid down, dipped it in the ink, and tried to make a letter.  \"Well done,\" said Swythe, smiling; \"that is something like O.  Now make another, and try if you can make it worse than the last.\"  The boy looked up at him sharply.  \"You are laughing at me!\" he said.  \"Well, if I am, it is only to make you try and do better.  Go on again!\"  The boy hesitated before looking hard at the letter he had tried to imitate, and then tried once more.  \"Ever so much better!\" cried the monk.  \"Come to me every day, and try like that, and in a very short time you will be able to read and write.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  THE GREAT WHITE HORSE.  Encouraged by these words of the monk and the smiles and praises of the Queen, Alfred made rapid progress, which, oddly enough, grew quicker still from the way in which Bald and his brothers ridiculed him and laughed at his attempts, for their gibes angered him, but only made him work the harder, and with results which Swythe told the Queen were wonderful.  Six long weary weeks had passed away since Ethelwulf had gone with his little army against the Danes, and only once had news been received, so that Queen Osburga's face grew whiter, thinner, and more sad day by day, till one evening when, after a long hard day's work with the monk, the pair went up to the top of the highest hill near to watch for the appearance of a messenger.  Swythe could see no sign of anything.  \"There is no news,\" he said sadly.  \"Let us go back.  The Queen is waiting to hear what we have found.\"  \"There is news,\" cried the boy excitedly.  \"I can see the points of spears right away there in the valley.  Look, the sun shines upon them and makes them glitter.\"  \"Yes, I see now,\" cried Swythe excitedly.  \"Quick, let's try and run, boy.  The Danes!  The Danes!  We must get the Queen away into the woods so as to be safe.\"  \"Why not stop in the big house, and shut up every window and door?  We must fight.  You can fight, Father Swythe?\"  \"I, my boy?\" said the monk sadly.  \"Yes, with my tongue.  No, I am only a man of peace.  All we can do is to fly for our lives.  There are not twenty strong fighting-men, Fred, my son, and those who are coming against us must, from the spears and shining iron caps with wings like the Norsemen wear, be quite a thousand.  Quick!  You can go faster than I.  Run on first and warn the good Queen that it is time to fly!\"  Alfred nodded his head quickly and started off to run; but at that moment it struck him that it would be foolish to run and give the alarm without being sure.  The monk had declared the force to be the enemy, but the boy wished to see for himself, and, darting sidewise, he ran down the hill, bearing to his right, till by stooping he could keep under cover of the gorse-bushes and approach quite near to the coming army.  It was a daring thing to do, for it might have ended in being made a prisoner without the chance of giving the alarm; but the brave act turned out to be quite wise, for when at last the boy had drawn near to the great body of armed men and crouched lower till he found a place through which he could peer cautiously, he sprang to his feet with a shout of joy.  For there in front rode his father, King Ethelwulf, mounted upon a sturdy horse, but so changed that he hardly knew him, for he was wearing a Danish helmet ornamented with a pair of grey gull's wings, half-opened and pointed back, while in his left hand he carried a Danish shield painted with a black raven, and in his right was a shining double battle-axe.  Alfred's cry was answered by a shout from the men, and Ethelwulf rode forward to meet his son, who grasped his extended hands and sprang up to sit in front of him upon the horse.  \"Your mother--Osburga?\" said the King hoarsely.  \"Ill, father, because you do not come,\" cried the boy excitedly.  \"Hah!  Then she will soon be well,\" said the King, with a sigh of content.  \"Yonder is plump little Swythe coming to welcome me, I see,\" he continued; \"but where are your brothers?\"  \"I don't know, father,\" replied the boy, innocently enough.  \"They have not come back from hunting, I think.\"  King Ethelwulf frowned, but said no more then, contenting himself with pressing forward to give his hand to Swythe, who had followed the boy as soon as he saw him change his course; and soon after the King's heart was gladdened by seeing Osburga with her train of women and serfs coming to meet them, answering the Saxon soldiers' cheers.  But Bald, Bert, and Red had even then not come back from the chase.  That night the King told of the great victory which he had at last gained over the Danish invaders, who had been defeated with great slaughter near Farringdon, and it was in memory of that victory that the King returned to the battlefield with his men on a peaceful errand, and that was to use the spade instead of the battle-axe and sword, while they cut down through the green turf on one hill-side, right down to the clean, white, glistening chalk, after the lines had been marked out and the shape cleverly designed, working for weeks and weeks till there, on the slope they had carved out a huge white horse over a hundred yards in length--the Great White Horse of the Berkshire downs, which has remained as if galloping along until this day.  Year after year the scouring of that horse, as it is called, takes place, when men go and clear out the brown earth that has crumbled through frost and rain into the ditch-like lines which mark the horse's shape on the green hill-side, and make it stand out white and clear as ever.  No one will think it strange after what has been told that the youngest of those four boys grew up under Swythe's teaching wise and learned, and as brave as, or braver than, either of his three brothers, who, when at last King Ethelwulf died, succeeded in turn to be King of England.  They each sat on the throne--Ethelbald, Ethelbert, and Ethelred; but their reigns were short, for in twenty years they too had passed away, to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21315"],["title","The King's Sons (#6)"],["body","by the strong, brave, and learned man who drove the Danish' invaders finally from the shores of England, or forced them to become peaceful workers of the soil.  He was the brave warrior who never knew what it was to be conquered, but tried again and again till the enemy fled before him and his gallant men.  Old chronicles tell many stories of his deeds--stories that have grown old and old--and they tell too that the studious boy's teacher Swythe became Bishop of Winchester and was called a saint, while old writers have worked up a legend about the rain christening the apples on Saint Swithin's Day, and when it does, keeping on sprinkling them for forty days more; but, like many other stories, that one is not at all true, as any young reader may find out by watching the weather year by year.  But that does not matter to us, who have to deal with Alfred the Little, and who willingly agree that as he grew up he was worthily given the name of Alfred the Great."]]]
