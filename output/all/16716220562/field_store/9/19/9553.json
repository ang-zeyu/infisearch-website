I smoothed out the twisted scrap of paper, and on it were just a couple of lines in pencil:  \"Meet me in Holland Walk at dark to-night.  Walk up and down till I come.                                           A.  J.  R.\"  That was all!  Not another syllable after all these weeks, and the few words scribbled in a wild caricature of his scholarly and dainty hand! I was no longer to be alarmed by this sort of thing; it was all so like the Raffles I loved least; and to add to my indignation, when at length I looked up from the mysterious missive, the equally mysterious messenger had disappeared in a manner worthy of the whole affair.  He was, however, the first creature I espied under the tattered trees of Holland Walk that evening.  \"Seen 'im yet?\" he inquired confidentially, blowing a vile cloud from his horrid pipe.  \"No, I haven't; and I want to know where you've seen him,\" I replied sternly.  \"Why did you run away like that the moment you had given me his note?\"  \"Orders, orders,\" was the reply.  \"I ain't such a juggins as to go agen a toff as makes it worf while to do as I'm bid an' 'old me tongue.\"  \"And who may you be?\" I asked jealously.  \"And what are you to Mr. Raffles?\"  \"You silly ass, Bunny, don't tell all Kensington that I'm in town!\" replied my tatterdemalion, shooting up and smoothing out into a merely shabby Raffles.  \"Here, take my arm--I'm not so beastly as I look.  But neither am I in town, nor in England, nor yet on the face of the earth, for all that's known of me to a single soul but you.\"  \"Then where are you,\" I asked, \"between ourselves?\"  \"I've taken a house near here for the holidays, where I'm going in for a Rest Cure of my own description.  Why?  Oh, for lots of reasons, my dear Bunny; among others, I have long had a wish to grow my own beard; under the next lamppost you will agree that it's training on very nicely.  Then, you mayn't know it, but there's a canny man at Scotland Yard who has had a quiet eye on me longer than I like.  I thought it about time to have an eye on him, and I stared him in the face outside the Albany this very morning.  That was when I saw you go in, and scribbled a line to give you when you came out.  If he had caught us talking he would have spotted me at once.\"  \"So you are lying low out here!\"  \"I prefer to call it my Rest Cure,\" returned Raffles, \"and it's really nothing else.  I've got a furnished house at a time when no one else would have dreamed of taking one in town; and my very neighbors don't know I'm there, though I'm bound to say there are hardly any of them at home.  I don't keep a servant, and do everything for myself.  It's the next best fun to a desert island. Not that I make much work, for I'm really resting, but I haven't done so much solid reading for years. Rather a joke, Bunny: the man whose house I've taken is one of her Majesty's inspectors of prisons, and his study's a storehouse of criminology.  It has been quite amusing to lie on one's back and have a good look at one's self as others fondly imagine they see one.\"  \"But surely you get some exercise?\" I asked; for he was leading me at a good rate through the leafy byways of Campden Hill; and his step was as springy and as light as ever.  \"The best exercise I ever had in my life,\" said Raffles; \"and you would never live to guess what it is.  It's one of the reasons why I went in for this seedy kit.  I follow cabs.  Yes, Bunny, I turn out about dusk and meet the expresses at Euston or King's Cross; that is, of course, I loaf outside and pick my cab, and often run my three or four miles for a bob or less.  And it not only keeps you in the very pink: if you're good they let you carry the trunks up-stairs; and I've taken notes from the inside of more than one commodious residence which will come in useful in the autumn.  In fact, Bunny, what with these new Rowton houses, my beard, and my otherwise well-spent holiday, I hope to have quite a good autumn season before the erratic Raffles turns up in town.\"  I felt it high time to wedge in a word about my own far less satisfactory affairs.  But it was not necessary for me to recount half my troubles.  Raffles could be as full of himself as many a worse man, and I did not like his society the less for these human outpourings. They had rather the effect of putting me on better terms with myself, through bringing him down to my level for the time being.  But his egoism was not even skin-deep; it was rather a cloak, which Raffles could cast off quicker than any man I ever knew, as he did not fail to show me now.  \"Why, Bunny, this is the very thing!\" he cried.  \"You must come and stay with me, and we'll lie low side by side.  Only remember it really is a Rest Cure.  I want to keep literally as quiet as I was without you.  What do you say to forming ourselves at once into a practically Silent Order?  You agree?  Very well, then, here's the street and that's the house.\"  It was ever such a quiet little street, turning out of one of those which climb right over the pleasant hill.  One side was monopolized by the garden wall of an ugly but enviable mansion standing in its own ground; opposite were a solid file of smaller but taller houses; on neither side were there many windows alight, nor a solitary soul on the pavement or in the road.  Raffles led the way to one of the small tall houses.  It stood immediately behind a lamppost, and I could not but notice that a love-lock of Virginia creeper was trailing almost to the step, and that the bow-window on the ground floor was closely shuttered.  Raffles admitted himself with his latch-key, and I squeezed past him into a very narrow hall.  I did not hear him shut the door, but we were no longer in the lamplight, and he pushed softly past me in his turn.  \"I'll get a light,\" he muttered as he went; but to let him pass I had leaned against some electric switches, and while his back was turned I tried one of these without thinking.  In an instant hall and staircase were flooded with light; in another Raffles was upon me in a fury, and, all was dark once more.  He had not said a word, but I heard him breathing through his teeth.  Nor was there anything to tell me now.  The mere flash of electric light upon a hail of chaos and uncarpeted stairs, and on the face of Raffles as he sprang to switch it off, had been enough even for me.  \"So this is how you have taken the house,\" said I in his own undertone. \"'Taken' is good; 'taken' is beautiful!\"  \"Did you think I'd done it through an agent?\" he snarled.  \"Upon my word, Bunny, I did you the credit of supposing you saw the joke all the time!\"  \"Why shouldn't you take a house,\" I asked, \"and pay for it?\"  \"Why should I,\" he retorted, \"within three miles of the Albany? Besides, I should have had no peace; and I meant every word I said about my Rest Cure.\"  \"You are actually staying in a house where you've broken in to steal?\"  \"Not to steal, Bunny!  I haven't stolen a thing.  But staying here I certainly am, and having the most complete rest a busy man could wish.\"  \"There'll be no rest for me!\"  Raffles laughed as he struck a match.  I had followed him into what would have been the back drawing-room in the ordinary little London house; the inspector of prisons had converted it into a separate study by filling the folding doors with book-shelves, which I scanned at once for the congenial works of which Raffles had spoken.  I was not able to carry my examination very far.  Raffles had lighted a candle, stuck (by its own grease) in the crown of an opera hat, which he opened the moment the wick caught.  The light thus struck the ceiling in an oval shaft, which left the rest of the room almost as dark as it had been before.  \"Sorry, Bunny!\" said Raffles, sitting on one pedestal of a desk from which the top had been removed, and setting his makeshift lantern on the other.  \"In broad daylight, when it can't be spotted from the outside, you shall have as much artificial light as you like.  If you want to do some writing, that's the top of the desk on end against the mantlepiece.  You'll never have a better chance so far as interruption goes.  But no midnight oil or electricity!  You observe that their last care was to fix up these shutters; they appear to have taken the top off the desk to get at 'em without standing on it; but the beastly things wouldn't go all the way up, and the strip they leave would give us away to the backs of the other houses if we lit up after dark.  Mind that telephone!  If you touch the receiver they will know at the exchange that the house is not empty, and I wouldn't put it past the colonel to have told them exactly how long he was going to be away. He's pretty particular: look at the strips of paper to keep the dust off his precious books!\"  \"Is he a colonel?\" I asked, perceiving that Raffles referred to the absentee householder.  \"Of sappers,\" he replied, \"and a V.C. into the bargain, confound him! Got it at Rorke's Drift; prison governor or inspector ever since; favorite recreation, what do you think?  Revolver shooting!  You can read all about him in his own _Who's Who_.  A devil of a chap to tackle, Bunny, when he's at home!\"  \"And where is he now?\" I asked uneasily.  \"And do you know he isn't on his way home?\"  \"Switzerland,\" replied Raffles, chuckling; \"he wrote one too many labels, and was considerate enough to leave it behind for our guidance. Well, no one ever comes back from Switzerland at the beginning of September, you know; and nobody ever thinks of coming back before the servants. When they turn up they won't get in.  I keep the latch jammed, but the servants will think it's jammed itself, and while they're gone for the locksmith we shall walk out like gentlemen--if we haven't done so already.\"  \"As you walked in, I suppose?\"  Raffles shook his head in the dim light to which my sight was growing inured.  \"No, Bunny, I regret to say I came in through the dormer window."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2098"],["title","A Thief in the Night: A Book of Raffles' Adventures (#8)"],["body","were painting next door but one.  I never did like ladder work, but it takes less time than in picking a lock in the broad light of a street lamp.\"  \"So they left you a latch-key as well as everything else!\"  \"No, Bunny.  I was just able to make that for myself.  I am playing at 'Robinson Crusoe,' not 'The Swiss Family Robinson.'  And now, my dear Friday, if you will kindly take off those boots, we can explore the island before we turn in for the night.\"  The stairs were very steep and narrow, and they creaked alarmingly as Raffles led the way up, with the single candle in the crown of the colonel's hat.  He blew it out before we reached the half-landing, where a naked window stared upon the backs of the houses in the next road, but lit it again at the drawing-room door.  I just peeped in upon a semi-grand swathed in white and a row of water colors mounted in gold.  An excellent bathroom broke our journey to the second floor.  \"I'll have one to-night,\" said I, taking heart of a luxury unknown in my last sordid sanctuary.  \"You'll do no such thing,\" snapped Raffles.  \"Have the goodness to remember that our island is one of a group inhabited by hostile tribes. You can fill the bath quietly if you try, but it empties under the study window, and makes the very devil of a noise about it.  No, Bunny, I bale out every drop and pour it away through the scullery sink, so you will kindly consult me before you turn a tap. Here's your room; hold the light outside while I draw the curtains; it's the old chap's dressing-room.  Now you can bring the glim. How's that for a jolly wardrobe?  And look at his coats on their cross-trees inside: dapper old dog, shouldn't you say?  Mark the boots on the shelf above, and the little brass rail for his ties! Didn't I tell you he was particular? And wouldn't he simply love to catch us at his kit?\"  \"Let's only hope it would give him an apoplexy,\" said I shuddering.  \"I shouldn't build on it,\" replied Raffles.  \"That's a big man's trouble, and neither you nor I could get into the old chap's clothes. But come into the best bedroom, Bunny.  You won't think me selfish if I don't give it up to you?  Look at this, my boy, look at this! It's the only one I use in all the house.\"  I had followed him into a good room, with ample windows closely curtained, and he had switched on the light in a hanging lamp at the bedside.  The rays fell from a thick green funnel in a plateful of strong light upon a table deep in books.  I noticed several volumes of the \"Invasion of the Crimea.\"  \"That's where I rest the body and exercise the brain,\" said Raffles. \"I have long wanted to read my Kinglake from A to Z, and I manage about a volume a night.  There's a style for you, Bunny!  I love the punctilious thoroughness of the whole thing; one can understand its appeal to our careful colonel.  His name, did you say?  Crutchley, Bunny--Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C.\"  \"We'd put his valor to the test!\" said I, feeling more valiant myself after our tour of inspection.  \"Not so loud on the stairs,\" whispered Raffles.  \"There's only one door between us and--\"  Raffles stood still at my feet, and well he might!  A deafening double knock had resounded through the empty house; and to add to the utter horror of the moment, Raffles instantly blew out the light. I heard my heart pounding.  Neither of us breathed.  We were on our way down to the first landing, and for a moment we stood like mice; then Raffles heaved a deep sigh, and in the depths I heard the gate swing home.  \"Only the postman, Bunny!  He will come now and again, though they have obviously left instructions at the post-office.  I hope the old colonel will let them have it when he gets back.  I confess it gave me a turn.\"  \"Turn!\" I gasped.  \"I must have a drink, if I die for it.\"  \"My dear Bunny, that's no part of my Rest Cure.\"  \"Then good-by!  I can't stand it; feel my forehead; listen to my heart! Crusoe found a footprint, but he never heard a double-knock at the street door!\"  \"'Better live in the midst of alarms,'\" quoted Raffles, \"'than dwell in this horrible place.'  I must confess we get it both ways, Bunny. Yet I've nothing but tea in the house.\"  \"And where do you make that?  Aren't you afraid of smoke?\"  \"There's a gas-stove in the dining-room.\"  \"But surely to goodness,\" I cried, \"there's a cellar lower down!\"  \"My dear, good Bunny,\" said Raffles, \"I've told you already that I didn't come in here on business.  I came in for the Cure.  Not a penny will these people be the worse, except for their washing and their electric light, and I mean to leave enough to cover both items.\"  \"Then,\" said I, \"since Brutus is such a very honorable man, we will borrow a bottle from the cellar, and replace it before we go.\"  Raffles slapped me softly on the back, and I knew that I had gained my point.  It was often the case when I had the presence of heart and mind to stand up to him.  But never was little victory of mine quite so grateful as this.  Certainly it was a very small cellar, indeed a mere cupboard under the kitchen stairs, with a most ridiculous lock.  Nor was this cupboard overstocked with wine.  But I made out a jar of whiskey, a shelf of Zeltinger, another of claret, and a short one at the top which presented a little battery of golden-leafed necks and corks.  Raffles set his hand no lower.  He examined the labels while I held folded hat and naked light.  \"Mumm, '84!\" he whispered.  \"G. H. Mumm, and A.D. 1884!  I am no wine-bibber, Bunny, as you know, but I hope you appreciate the specifications as I do.  It looks to me like the only bottle, the last of its case, and it does seem a bit of a shame; but more shame for the miser who hoards in his cellar what was meant for mankind! Come, Bunny, lead the way.  This baby is worth nursing.  It would break my heart if anything happened to it now!\"  So we celebrated my first night in the furnished house; and I slept beyond belief, slept as I never was to sleep there again.  But it was strange to hear the milkman in the early morning, and the postman knocking his way along the street an hour later, and to be passed over by one destroying angel after another.  I had come down early enough, and watched through the drawing-room blind the cleansing of all the steps in the street but ours.  Yet Raffles had evidently been up some time; the house seemed far purer than overnight as though he had managed to air it room by room; and from the one with the gas-stove there came a frizzling sound that fattened the heart.  I only would I had the pen to do justice to the week I spent in-doors on Campden Hill!  It might make amusing reading; the reality for me was far removed from the realm of amusement.  Not that I was denied many a laugh of suppressed heartiness when Raffles and I were together.  But half our time we very literally saw nothing of each other.  I need not say whose fault that was.  He would be quiet; he was in ridiculous and offensive earnest about his egregious Cure. Kinglake he would read by the hour together, day and night, by the hanging lamp, lying up-stairs on the best bed.  There was daylight enough for me in the drawing-room below; and there I would sit immersed in criminous tomes weakly fascinated until I shivered and shook in my stocking soles.  Often I longed to do something hysterically desperate, to rouse Raffles and bring the street about our ears; once I did bring him about mine by striking a single note on the piano, with the soft pedal down.  His neglect of me seemed wanton at the time.  I have long realized that he was only wise to maintain silence at the expense of perilous amenities, and as fully justified in those secret and solitary sorties which made bad blood in my veins.  He was far cleverer than I at getting in and out; but even had I been his match for stealth and wariness, my company would have doubled every risk.  I admit now that he treated me with quite as much sympathy as common caution would permit.  But at the time I took it so badly as to plan a small revenge.  What with his flourishing beard and the increasing shabbiness of the only suit he had brought with him to the house, there was no denying that Raffles had now the advantage of a permanent disguise. That was another of his excuses for leaving me as he did, and it was the one I was determined to remove.  On a morning, therefore, when I awoke to find him flown again, I proceeded to execute a plan which I had already matured in my mind.  Colonel Crutchley was a married man; there were no signs of children in the house; on the other hand, there was much evidence that the wife was a woman of fashion.  Her dresses overflowed the wardrobe and her room; large, flat, cardboard boxes were to be found in every corner of the upper floors.  She was a tall woman; I was not too tall a man.  Like Raffles, I had not shaved on Campden Hill. That morning, however, I did my best with a very fair razor which the colonel had left behind in my room; then I turned out the lady's wardrobe and the cardboard boxes, and took my choice.  I have fair hair, and at the time it was rather long.  With a pair of Mrs. Crutchley's tongs and a discarded hair-net, I was able to produce an almost immodest fringe.  A big black hat with a wintry feather completed a headdress as unseasonable as my skating skirt and feather boa; of course, the good lady had all her summer frocks away with her in Switzerland.  This was all the more annoying from the fact that we were having a very warm September; so I was not sorry to hear Raffles return as I was busy adding a layer of powder to my heated countenance. I listened a moment on the landing, but as he went into the study I determined to complete my toilet in every detail.  My idea was first to give him the fright he deserved, and secondly to show him that I was quite as fit to move abroad as he.  It was, however, I confess, a pair of the colonel's gloves that I was buttoning as I slipped down to the study even"]]]
