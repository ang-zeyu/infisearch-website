Their descriptions of the appearance and habits of the birds they had observed were given with evident pleasure. They had a strong desire to tell what they had seen, not in the spirit of rivalry, but with the wish of adding to the knowledge of a subject in which all were equally interested.  It was thought that this work would be done with even more effectiveness if a day were appointed to be celebrated as \"Bird Day.\" With the hope of making a memorable occasion of the day for those taking part in it, several of the noted friends of birds were asked to write something to the children, and to give their opinion of the introduction of \"Bird Day\" into the schools.  Secretary J. Sterling Morton, the father of \"Arbor Day,\" responded with the following earnest letter, which was at once given to the public through Washington dispatches, and later was sent out from the Department of Agriculture, in circular No. 17:--  WASHINGTON, D. C., April 23, 1894.  MR. C. A. BABCOCK, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, OIL CITY, PA.       _Dear Sir_,--Your proposition to establish a \"Bird Day\" on      the same general plan as \"Arbor Day,\" has my cordial      approval.       Such a movement can hardly fail to promote the development      of a healthy public sentiment toward our native birds,      favoring their preservation and increase. If directed toward      this end, and not to the encouragement of the importation of      foreign species, it is sure to meet the approval of the      American people.       It is a melancholy fact that among the enemies of our birds      two of the most destructive and relentless are our women and      our boys. The love of feather ornamentation so heartlessly      persisted in by thousands of women, and the mania for      collecting eggs and killing birds so deeply rooted in our      boys, are legacies of barbarism inherited from our savage      ancestry. The number of beautiful and useful birds annually      slaughtered for bonnet trimmings runs up into the hundreds      of thousands, and threatens, if it has not already      accomplished, the extermination of some of the rarer      species. The insidious egg-hunting and pea-shooting      proclivities of the small boy are hardly less widespread and      destructive. It matters little which of the two agencies is      the more fatal, since neither is productive of any good. One      looks to the gratification of a shallow vanity, the other to      the gratification of a cruel instinct and an expenditure of      boyish energy that might be profitably diverted into other      channels. The evil is one against which legislation can be      only palliative and of local efficiency. Public sentiment,      on the other hand, if properly fostered in the schools,      would gain force with the growth and development of our boys      and girls, and would become a hundredfold more potent than      any law enacted by the State or Congress. I believe such a      sentiment can be developed, so strong and so universal that      a respectable woman will be ashamed to be seen with the wing      of a wild bird on her bonnet, and an honest boy will be      ashamed to own that he ever robbed a nest or wantonly took      the life of a bird.       Birds are of inestimable value to mankind. Without their      unremitting services our gardens and fields would be laid      waste by insect pests. But we owe them a greater debt even      than this, for the study of birds tends to develop some of      the best attributes and impulses of our natures. Among them      we find examples of generosity, unselfish devotion, of the      love of mother for offspring, and other estimable qualities.      Their industry, patience, and ingenuity excite our      admiration; their songs inspire us with a love of music and      poetry; their beautiful plumages and graceful manners appeal      to our Ã¦sthetic sense; their long migrations to distant      lands stimulate our imaginations and tempt us to inquire      into the causes of these periodic movements; and finally,      the endless modifications of form and habits by which they      are enabled to live under most diverse conditions of food      and climate--on land and at sea--invite the student of      nature into inexhaustible fields of pleasurable research.       The cause of bird protection is one that appeals to the best      side of our natures. Let us yield to the appeal. Let us have      a Bird Day--a day set apart from all the other days of the      year to tell the children about the birds. But we must not      stop here. We should strive continually to develop and      intensify the sentiment of bird protection, not alone for      the sake of preserving the birds, but also for the sake of      replacing as far as possible the barbaric impulses inherent      in child nature by the nobler impulses and aspirations that      should characterize advanced civilization.  Respectfully,  J. STERLING MORTON,  _Secretary of Agriculture._  Other friends of the birds responded cordially to the request, as will be seen by the following letters:--  WEST PARK, N. Y., April 22, 1894.       _Dear Sir_,--In response to yours of the seventeenth, I      enclose a few notes about birds to be read upon your \"Bird      Day\"--just an item or two to stimulate the curiosity of the      young people. The idea is a good one, and I hope you may      succeed in starting a movement that may extend to all the      schools of the country.  Very truly yours,  JOHN BURROUGHS.  628 HANCOCK STREET, BROOKLYN, N. Y., April 25, 1894.  MR. C. A. BABCOCK.       _Dear Sir_,--Yours of the nineteenth is received. I am      delighted to know that your school children are to have a      \"Bird Day.\" I wish I could be there to tell them something      of the delight of getting acquainted with their little      brothers in feathers; how much more interesting they are      when alive and doing all sorts of quaint and charming things      than when dead and made into \"skins\" or stuffed; and how      much greater is the pleasure of watching them to see how      they live, where they get their dinner, how they take care      of themselves, than of killing them, or hurting them, or      even just driving them away. If the boys and girls only try      keeping still and watching birds to see what they will do, I      am sure no boy will ever again want to throw a stone at one,      and no girl ever to have a dead bird on her hat.  Very truly yours,  OLIVE THORNE MILLER.  CLINTON, April 30, 1894.       _My Dear Sir_,--It strikes me that your idea is a      particularly happy one. Should you institute a \"Bird Day,\"      the feathered tribe ought to furnish music for the occasion.      A chorus of robins and thrushes and a few other songsters      would be more appropriate than an orchestra. With thanks for      your cordial good wishes, I am,  Yours faithfully,  CLINTON SCOLLARD.  From the Department of Public Instruction of Pennsylvania this encouraging letter was received:--  HARRISBURG, April 27, 1894.  SUPERINTENDENT C. A. BABCOCK.       _Dear Sir_,--In your plan to inaugurate a \"Bird Day\" you      have struck a capital idea. When in the name of agriculture      a scalp act can be passed resulting in a year and a half in      the payment of $75,000 by the county treasuries of      Pennsylvania for the destruction of birds that were      subsequently proved to belong to the feathered friends of      the farmer, it is high time to make our pupils acquainted      with the habits and ways of the feathered tribes. Some birds      remain with us the whole year, others are summer sojourners,      still others are only transient visitors. How much of the      beauty of our environment is lost by those"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21266"],["title","Bird Day; How to prepare for it (#1)"],["body"," never listen      to the music of the birds and never see the richness of      their plumage!       May success attend you in carrying out your new idea of a      \"Bird Day.\"  Very truly yours,  NATHAN C. SCHAEFFER,  _Superintendent of Public Instruction_.  Bradford Torrey gives an additional title to the day, showing his appreciation of it:--  WELLESLEY HILLS, MASS., April 21, 1894.       _Dear Mr. Babcock_,--Your young people are to be      congratulated. \"Bird Day\" is something new to me--a new      saints' day in my calendar, so to speak. The thought is so      pleasing to me that I wish you had given me its date, so      that in spirit I might observe it with you. Tell your pupils      that to cultivate an acquaintance with things out of      doors--flowers, trees, rocks, but especially animate      creatures, and best of all, birds--is one of the surest ways      of laying up happiness for themselves; and laying up      happiness is even better than laying up money, though I am      so old-fashioned a body and so true a Yankee as to believe      in that also.       All the naturalists I have known have been men of sunny      temper. Let your boys and girls cultivate their eyes and      ears, and their hearts and minds as well, by the study of      living birds, their comings and goings, their songs and      their ways; let them learn to find out things for      themselves; to know the difference between guess-work and      knowledge; and they will thank you as long as they live for      having encouraged them in so good a cause. With all good      wishes for the success of your first \"Bird Day\"--and many to      come after it,  Very truly yours,  BRADFORD TORREY.  The first observance of \"Bird Day,\" May 4, 1894, is briefly set forth in the following paragraph from the _New England Journal of Education_:--       The day was observed in the Oil City schools with a degree      of enthusiasm which was good to see. The amount of      information about birds that was collected by the children      was simply amazing. Original compositions were read,      informal discussions were held, talks by teachers were      given, and the birds in literature were not forgotten or      overlooked. The interest was not confined to the children,      one gentleman surprising the classes in which his children      celebrated the day by presenting to them artistic programs      of the exercises.       It seems to those interested that the idea simply needs to      be made known to meet with a warm welcome, akin to that with      which we greet our first robin or song sparrow in the      spring.     II  THE VALUE OF BIRDS   Probably few people understand the value of birds or comprehend how closely and yet how extensively their lives are interwoven with other forms of life. The general sentiment in regard to them, at the best, has been that they are harmless, even interesting and beautiful creatures; but the idea that they are one of the most important classes of creation, a class upon which the existence of many other classes depends, has never been widely prevalent. Suppose we were asked which is of more use to man, the fishes of our waters or the birds of our forests and fields? Many of us would unhesitatingly answer in favor of the fishes.  If all of these denizens of the rivers, lakes, and seas should be destroyed, it would be a stupendous calamity. Mankind would universally deplore it; and if the nations of the world should, at any time, become convinced that such a thing might occur, how quickly they would take all possible means to prevent it! All civilized people now have laws to preserve this food supply and are making expensive and laborious efforts to increase it. Any one who should destroy thousands of tons of these edible swimmers, simply for their heads and tails, or fins and scales, would be regarded as a dangerous person. But if our supposition were realized, if every fin and gill were to disappear from the waters of the globe, what would be the result? A misfortune, truly, for the fins represent a large part of the world's supply of food, and this loss would be felt more deeply as time went on, because the ocean will not raise its rent, however crowded may be the population of its shores. The effort to secure the fish might be applied, however, in other directions and be equally remunerative. Harvest would still follow seedtime; the gold of autumn still reward the shallow mines of spring.  But suppose we were forced to the dreadful alternative of choosing between the birds and the quadrupeds, again, the most of us would probably decide against the birds. If the four-footed beasts should disappear from the earth, it would be a much greater disaster than the destruction of the fishes. A much larger fraction of the food supply would be lost; while many of these animals contribute to man's comfort and necessities in almost innumerable ways. Most nations have learned to cherish their friends with hoofs and horns, and even some of those with claws. Cruelty to animals is now generally forbidden by law; and their wanton destruction would be regarded with horror. No one would be permitted to slaughter large numbers of them because he might wish to sell their horns or ears or the tips of their tails.  By the departure of the quadrupeds the life of man would be rendered much more difficult, but would still be possible. From fish and fowl he could obtain a supply of meat limited in variety, yet sufficient for his needs. The treasures of the vegetable world would still be his, though he would miss the help of his animal allies in securing them; but his ingenuity would help him to supply this loss, in part, at least.  Consider now what would be the effect of the total destruction of birds. Birds are nature's check to the amazing power of insects to increase. If insect life were allowed free course, it would soon overpower vegetation; and plant life--and, therefore, animal life, including that of man--would be impossible upon this globe. This is an astounding conclusion, but it is sustained by the judgment of every man of science who has investigated the subject. How long could the ravages of insects be stayed were the birds gone? We should have to depend upon a few predaceous beetles, the bats, and upon the sprayers and squirtguns which throw insecticides. Think of the Ã¦sthetic loss in substituting these agencies for the \"sweet spirits\" of the wood and field! Besides not being musical or charming in action, they would not prove efficient. Birds are therefore essential to the life of man.  Their preservation is not merely a matter of sentiment, or of education in that high and fine feeling, kindness to all living things. It has a utilitarian side of vast extent, as broad as our boundless fields and our orchards' sweep. The birds are nature's guarantee that the reign of the crawlers and spinners shall not become universal. The \"plague of locusts\" shall be upon those who sin against them.     III  THE DESTRUCTION OF BIRDS   From almost all sections of the country comes the plaint that the song birds are fast disappearing. Less and less numerous are the yearly visitations of the thrushes, warblers, song sparrows, orioles, and the others whose habits have been so delightful and whose music has been so cheering to their open-eyed and open-hearted friends. Many, who when listening to the hymn-like cadences of the wood thrush have felt that the place was holy ground, are now keenly regretting that this vesper song is so rare; the honest sweetness of the song sparrow mingles with the coarser sounds less often in the accustomed places. Not many now find \"the meadows spattered all over with music\" by the bobolink, as Thoreau did.  John Burroughs says that the bluebird is almost extinct in his section of country. The writer, though a frequent visitor to the fields and woods, has succeeded in seeing only one pair of these beautiful birds in two seasons, where they were abundant a few years ago, when almost every orchard bore a good crop of them. A friend who is a good observer has had the same experience. A careful exploration of the country within a radius of five miles resulted in the discovery of only two pairs of bobolinks, having their nests luckily in the same field. The males sang together in friendly rivalry. The sparkling, tinkling notes seemed to come in a rippling tumble, two or three at a time, from each throat. Each started his song with his feet barely touching his perch, his body quivering, his wings half extended, as if he were almost supported by the upward flow of his melody. After circular flights he alighted first upon one frail, swinging perch, then upon another, the wonderful sounds not ceasing, as if he were tracing magic rings of song round his home, and making them thick in places. It was a musical embodiment of the love of life and of its joyousness.  The brown thrush is also absent from places where once there were many. A farmer in this neighborhood states that a few years ago the treetops near his house seemed to be filled with these fine singers. Now he hears only one or two during the season. Last May the writer found three nests at least a mile apart, but they were destroyed before the time of hatching, and the birds went about silent as if brooding upon their trouble. It is doubtful if they will build next season in that vicinity. No doubt the clearing away of the forests and the settling up of the country are responsible for the scarcity of the birds in part, but only in part. If they were let alone, many of the most interesting and useful birds would build near even our city homes, and our gardens and fields would again become populous with them.  The wearing of feathers and the skins of birds for ornament is the chief cause of the final flight of many of our songsters. It is stated that a London dealer received at one time more than thirty thousand dead humming birds. Not only brightly colored"]]]
