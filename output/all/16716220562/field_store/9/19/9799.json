Not so; the birds lost their beauty      with their lives.--CELIA THAXTER.       I walked up my garden path as I was coming home from      shooting. My dog ran on before me; suddenly he went slower      and crept carefully forward as if he scented game. I looked      along the path and perceived a young sparrow, with its downy      head and yellow bill. It had fallen from a nest (the wind      was blowing hard through the young birch trees beside the      path) and was sprawling motionless, helpless, on the ground,      with its little wings outspread. My dog crept softly up to      it, when suddenly an old black-breasted sparrow threw      himself down from a neighboring tree and let himself fall      like a stone directly under the dog's nose, and, with      ruffled feathers, sprang with a terrified twitter several      times against his open, threatening mouth. He had flown down      to protect his young at the sacrifice of himself. His little      body trembled all over, his cry was hoarse, he was      frightened to death; but he sacrificed himself. My dog must      have seemed to him a gigantic monster, but for all that, he      could not stay on his high, safe branch. A power stronger      than himself drove him down. My dog stopped and drew back;      it seemed as if he, too, respected this power. I hastened to      call back the amazed dog, and reverently withdrew. Yes,      don't laugh; I felt a reverence for this little hero of a      bird, with his paternal love.       Love, thought I, is mightier than death and the fear of      death; love alone inspires and is the life of all.--IVAN      TOURGUENEFF.       The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger      hope than ever! The faint, silvery warblings heard over the      partially bare and moist fields from the bluebird, the song      sparrow, and the redwing, as if the last flakes of winter      tinkled as they fell!--H. D. THOREAU.       I heard a robin in the distance, the first I had heard for      many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not      forget for many a thousand more,--the same sweet, powerful      song as of yore.--_Ibid._       Walden is melting apace. A great field of ice has cracked      off from the main body. I hear a song sparrow from the      bushes on the shore,--_olit, olit, olit--chip, chip, chip,      che char--che wis, wis, wis_. He, too, is helping to crack      the ice.--_Ibid._       The bluebird carries the sky on his back.--_Ibid._  6. One of the most interesting features of a Bird Day program will be the personations of birds.  The following was given by a boy in the seventh grade:--       One day in February a gentleman and his wife stopped beside      the wall of old Fort Marion, in St. Augustine, to listen to      my song. The sun was shining brightly, and little white      flowers were blooming in the green turf about the old fort.      It was not time yet to build my nest, so I had nothing to do      but sing and get my food and travel a little every day      toward my Northern home.       I am about as large as a robin, and although there is      nothing brilliant in my plumage I am not a homely bird. I      like the songs of other birds and sometimes sing them. I      frequently sing like my cousins, the catbirds and robins and      thrushes. But I have my own song, which is unlike all the      others. My mate and I build a large nest of small sticks,      pieces of string, cotton, and weeds, in thick bushes or low      trees. We have five eggs that are greenish blue and spotted      with brown. We eat many beetles, larvæ, and many kinds of      insects which we find feeding upon plants. The worst enemy      we have is man. He steals our children almost before we have      taught them to sing, and puts them in cages. He is a      monster.       Many poems have been written about me. One of the finest is      by Sidney Lanier, in which he calls me \"yon trim Shakespeare      on the tree.\"       Any one who has heard my song can never forget me.       What is my name?  7. Bird facts and proverbs form a valuable part of a program and may be given by some of the children. Let the pupils search for them and bring some similar to these:--       Birds flock together in hard times.       A bird in the bush is worth two in the hand.       The American robin is not the same bird as the English.       The bluebird and robin may be harbingers of spring, but the      swallow is the harbinger of summer.       The dandelion tells me to look for the swallow; the      dog-toothed violet when to expect the wood thrush.--JOHN      BURROUGHS.       It is not thought that any one bird spends the year in one      locality, but that all birds migrate, if only within a      limited range.       A loon was caught, by a set line for fishing, sixty-five      feet below the surface of a lake in New York, having dived      to that depth for a fish.       The wood pewee, like its relative, the phoebe, feeds      largely on the family of flies to which the house fly      belongs.       The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day      to destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are unceasingly      persecuted.       Seventy-five per cent of the food of the downy woodpecker is      insects.       The cow blackbird lays its eggs in other birds' nests, one      in a nest. What happens afterwards?       Why should not a man love a bird? If the palm of one could      clasp the pinion of the other, there would come together two      of the greatest implements God and nature have ever given      any two creatures to explore the world with, and when two      bipeds gaze at each other, eye to eye, the intelligence in      the one might well take off its hat to the subtle instincts      in the other.--JAMES NEWTON BASKETT.       A bird on the bonnet means so much less bread on the table.      A bird in the orchard is a sort of scavenger and pomologist      combined, and does his share in giving you a dish of fruit      for dinner. The scarlet tanager looks like a living ruby in      a green tree; but--I speak bluntly--it looks like a chunk of      gore on a woman's bonnet. In behalf of good taste and the      birds, I enter my protest against this barbarous      Custom.--LEANDER T. KEYSER.      What does it cost, this garniture of death?       It costs the life which God alone can give;     It costs dull silence, where was music's breath;       It costs dead joy, that foolish pride may live.     Ah, life, and joy, and song, depend upon it,     Are costly trimmings for a woman's bonnet.  --MAY RILEY SMITH.  The program may be diversified by songs about birds. Many suitable for this occasion will be found in a collection called \"Songs of Happy Life,\" made by Sarah J. Eddy. It is published by the Nature Study Publishing Company, of Providence, R. I.     VIII  THE POETS AND THE BIRDS   \"The birds are the poets' own,\" says Burroughs. How could it be otherwise? The bird, with his large brain, quick circulation, and high temperature, is possessed of a tropical, ecstatic soul that blossoms into music as naturally as a bulb bursts into bloom and fragrance. He is a creature of marvelous inheritance. Poetry is a true bird-land, where you shall hear the birds as often as in any meadow or orchard on a May morning. All poets have been their lovers, from the psalmist of old, who knew \"all the birds of the mountains,\" to our own Lowell with his \"Gladness on wings--the bobolink is here.\"  The poets, who voice our deepest thoughts, have studied birds with the utmost care. It is astonishing to note the mention made of them in the pages of Browning, Tennyson, and in fact of every great maker of verse. Not merely as adjuncts of the landscape are they mentioned, but with intensity of feeling, as in William Watson's poem on his recovery from temporary loss of mind--one of the most pathetic poems ever written--where he thanks the Heavenly Power for letting him feel once again at home in nature and again related to the birds and to human life. Dr. Van Dyke's wish that, when his twilight hour is come, he \"may hear the wood note of the veery\" finds response in the heart of every one who has listened to that song. Frequently the poet seems to have entered into the life of the bird and to have found his inner secret, as Keats in the \"Ode to a Nightingale\":--      Immortal bird, thou wast not born for death,     No hungry generations tread thee down.  Sometimes the words seem to have caught the rhythm and ripple of the song, as in Browning's reference to the thrush:--      The wise thrush, he sings each song twice over,     Lest you think he never could recapture     That first fine careless rapture.  Or the bird's voice may be so suggestive as to lead the seer to the very limits of thought and aspiration, like Shelley's \"Skylark.\" As we need the help of the naturalists, who see more accurately than we, we also need the assistance of the poet's clearer vision, with its wider and deeper sweep. How completely Sidney Lanier summed up the mocking bird! and how much more pleasing is the bird in the tree because of the bird in the poem:--      Superb and sole, upon a plumèd spray     That o'er the general leafage boldly grew,     He summed the woods in song; or typic drew     The watch of hungry hawks, the lone dismay     Of languid doves when long their lovers stray,     And all birds' passion plays that sprinkle dew     At morn in brake or bosky avenue.     Whate'er birds did or dreamed, this bird could say.     Then down he shot, bounced airily along     The sward, twitched in a grasshopper, made song     Midflight, perched, prinked, and to his art again.     Sweet science, this large riddle read me plain:--     How may the death of that dull insect be     The life of yon trim Shakespeare on the tree?

I am also indebted to the literary editor of the _Springfield Republican_ and to the editors of _Poet-Lore_, respectively, for allowing me to reprint the paper on _Thomas Hardy_ and the lecture on _An Elizabethan Novelist_.

IVES     THE BIBLIOTAPH AND OTHER PEOPLE     THE BIBLIOTAPH: A PORTRAIT NOT WHOLLY IMAGINARY   A popular and fairly orthodox opinion concerning book-collectors is that their vices are many, their virtues of a negative sort, and their ways altogether past finding out. Yet the most hostile critic is bound to admit that the fraternity of bibliophiles is eminently picturesque. If their doings are inscrutable, they are also romantic; if their vices are numerous, the heinousness of those vices is mitigated by the fact that it is possible to sin humorously. Regard him how you will, the sayings and doings of the collector give life and color to the pages of those books which treat of books. He is amusing when he is purely an imaginary creature. For example, there was one Thomas Blinton. Every one who has ever read the volume called _Books and Bookmen_ knows about Thomas Blinton. He was a man who wickedly adorned his volumes with morocco bindings, while his wife 'sighed in vain for some old _point d'Alençon lace_.' He was a man who was capable of bidding fifteen pounds for a Foppens edition of the essays of Montaigne, though fifteen pounds happened to be 'exactly the amount which he owed his plumber and gas-fitter, a worthy man with a large family.' From this fictitious Thomas Blinton all the way back to Richard Heber, who was very real, and who piled up books as other men heap together vulgar riches, book-collectors have been a picturesque folk.  The name of Heber suggests the thought that all men who buy books are not bibliophiles. He alone is worthy the title who acquires his volumes with something like passion. One may buy books like a gentleman, and that is very well. One may buy books like a gentleman and a scholar, which counts for something more. But to be truly of the elect one must resemble Richard Heber, and buy books like a gentleman, a scholar, and a madman.  You may find an account of Heber in an old file of _The Gentleman's Magazine_. He began in his youth by making a library of the classics. Then he became interested in rare English books, and collected them _con amore_ for thirty years. He was very rich, and he had never given hostages to fortune; it was therefore possible for him to indulge his fine passion without stint. He bought only the best books, and he bought them by thousands and by tens of thousands. He would have held as foolishness that saying from the Greek which exhorts one to do nothing too much. According to Heber's theory, it is impossible to have too many good books. Usually one library is supposed to be enough for one man. Heber was satisfied only with eight libraries, and then he was hardly satisfied. He had a library in his house at Hodnet. 'His residence in Pimlico, where he died, was filled, like Magliabecchi's at Florence, with books from the top to the bottom; every chair, every table, every passage containing piles of erudition.' He had a house in York Street which was crowded with books. He had a library in Oxford, one at Paris, one at Antwerp, one at Brussels, and one at Ghent. The most accurate estimate of his collections places the number at 146,827 volumes. Heber is believed to have spent half a million dollars for books. After his death the collections were dispersed. The catalogue was published in twelve parts, and the sales lasted over three years.  Heber had a witty way of explaining why he possessed so many copies of the same book. When taxed with the sin of buying duplicates he replied in this manner: 'Why, you see, sir, no man can comfortably do without _three_ copies of a book. One he must have for his show copy, and he will probably keep it at his country house; another he will require for his own use and reference; and unless he is inclined to part with this, which is very inconvenient, or risk the injury of his best copy, he must needs have a third at the service of his friends.'  In the pursuit of a coveted volume Heber was indefatigable. He was not of those Sybaritic buyers who sit in their offices while agents and dealers do the work. 'On hearing of a curious book he has been known to put himself into the mail-coach, and travel three, four, or five hundred miles to obtain it, fearful to trust his commission to a letter.' He knew the solid comfort to be had in reading a book catalogue. Dealers were in the habit of sending him the advance sheets of their lists. He ordered books from his death-bed, and for anything we know to the contrary died with a catalogue in his fingers.  A life devoted to such a passion is a stumbling-block to the practical man, and to the Philistine foolishness. Yet you may hear men praised because up to the day of death they were diligent in business,--business which added to life nothing more significant than that useful thing called money. Thoreau used to say that if a man spent half his time in the woods for the love of the woods he was in danger of being looked upon as a loafer; but if he spent all his time as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making Earth bald before her time, he was regarded as an upright and industrious citizen.  Heber had a genius for friendship as well as for gathering together choice books. Sir Walter Scott addressed verses to him. Professor Porson wrote emendations for him in his favorite copy of _Athenæus_. To him was inscribed Dr. Ferrier's poetical epistle on Bibliomania. His virtues were celebrated by Dibdin and by Burton. In brief, the sketch of Heber in The_ Gentleman's Magazine_ for January, 1834, contains a list of forty-six names,--all men of distinction by birth, learning, or genius, and all men who were proud to call Richard Heber friend. He was a mighty hunter of books. He was genial, scholarly, generous. Out-of-door men will be pleased to know that he was active physically. He was a tremendous walker, and enjoyed tiring out his bailiff by an all-day tramp.  Of many good things said of him this is one of the best: 'The learned and curious, whether rich or poor, have always free access to his library.' Thus was it possible for Scott very truthfully to say to Heber, 'Thy volumes open as thy heart.'  No life of this Prince of Book-Hunters has been written, I believe. Some one with access to the material, and a sympathy with the love of books as books, should write a memoir of Heber the Magnificent. It ought not to be a large volume, but it might well be about the size of Henry Stevens's _Recollections of James_ _Lenox_. And if it were equally readable it were a readable book indeed.  Dibdin thought that Heber's tastes were so catholic as to make it difficult to classify him among hunters of books. The implication is that most men can be classified. They have their specialties. What pleases one collector much pleases another but little or not at all. Collectors differ radically in the attitude they take with respect to their volumes. One man buys books to read, another buys them to gloat over, a third that he may fortify them behind glass doors and keep the key in his pocket. Therefore have learned words been devised to make apparent the varieties of motive and taste. These words begin with _biblio_; you may have a _biblio_ almost anything.  Two interesting types of maniac are known respectively as the bibliotaph and the biblioclast. A biblioclast is one who indulges himself in the questionable pleasure of mutilating books in order more sumptuously to fit out a particular volume. The disease is English in origin, though some of the worst cases have been observed in America. Clergymen and presidents of colleges have been known to be seized with it. The victim becomes more or less irresponsible, and presently runs mad. Such an one was John Bagford, of diabolical memory, who mutilated not less than ten thousand volumes to form his vast collection of title-pages. John Bagford died an unrepentant sinner, lamenting with one of his later breaths that he could not live long enough to get hold of a genuine Caxton and rip the initial page out of that.  The bibliotaph buries books; not literally, but sometimes with as much effect as if he had put his books underground. There are several varieties of him. The dog-in-the-manger bibliotaph is the worst; he uses his books but little himself, and allows others to use them not at all. On the other hand, a man may be a bibliotaph simply from inability to get at his books. He may be homeless, a bachelor, a denizen of boarding-houses, a wanderer upon the face of the earth. He may keep his books in storage or accumulate them in the country, against the day when he shall have a town house with proper library.  The most genial lover of books who has walked city streets for many a day was a bibliotaph. He accumulated books for years in the huge garret of a farmhouse standing upon the outskirts of a Westchester County village. A good relative 'mothered' the books for him in his absence.
