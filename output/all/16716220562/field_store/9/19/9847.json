Knocked me flat on my back, he did.\"  \"Knocked me on my face,\" cried the proprietor angrily.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"is there any skin off my nose?  I fell against a tree.\"  \"Took a little bit of the bark off,\" grumbled the man, who did not seem at all sympathetic.  \"Hadn't you better let him fill hisself full, sir, and have a rest?  He'll come easy, perhaps, then.\"  \"Do you want me to stand still here and see a devouring elephant go on eating till he ruins me?  We must all join together and drive him out.\"  \"But he'll drive us out, sir,\" said the man in a tone full of remonstrance.  \"Then we must try again.  I am not going to be beaten by a beast like that.\"  \"Look here, my man,\" said Morris, \"hadn't you better tie him up to one of the trees and leave him till to-morrow?  They do this sort of thing abroad, I hear, by tying the elephant's legs or ankles to the trunks of trees.\"  \"What!\" shouted Ramball.  \"Why, he'd take them all up by the roots and go cantering through the town, doing no end of mischief, with them hanging to his legs.  Think I want to have to pay for the trees as well as the apples?\"  \"Then--er--lasso him and lead him home.\"  \"Lass which, sir?\"  \"Lasso him, my man, with ropes.\"  \"Why, he ain't a wild ostrich of the desert, sir.  Look at him!--Here, one on yer run off and fetch the longest cart-rope.  This 'ere gentleman would like to have a try.\"  The boys were roaring with laughter by this time, the mathematical master's parasites joining in as heartily as Glyn and Singh.  \"Don't be rude, fellow,\" said Morris.  \"Don't be rude?\" cried Ramball, who was fuming with disappointment and rage.  \"Rude yourself.  If you give me much more of your sarce I'll set the animile at you.\"  As this was proceeding, the elephant, whose taste for apples had been satiated, came slowly out into the open, to stand bending and bowing his massive head, which he swayed slowly from side to side and blinked and flapped his ears, as he watched the assembly with his little reddish eyes in a way which made the mathematical master grip Slegge by the arm.  \"I am getting uneasy,\" he whispered, \"about you boys.  Don't run, but follow me slowly back to the fence.  Tell the other boys, and we will go at once.\"  \"Can't you coax him out, sir?\" said Glyn, as he approached the proprietor.  \"No, I can't coax him out,\" cried Ramball snappishly; \"but you mind your own business, I know mine.  I have had enough of you putting your spoons in my porridge.\"  \"Here, Mr Severn!  Mr Singh!\" shouted the mathematical master.  \"This way!  We are going back to the college.\"  But he did not go far.  \"But I want to see the elephant brought out, sir,\" replied Singh.  \"He oughtn't to be left like this.  He may do mischief.\"  \"Oh, now you've begun, have you?\" yelped the proprietor, whose voice in his anger had gradually reached the soprano.  \"I suppose you would like to have a try?\"  \"Oh, I don't want to interfere,\" replied Singh coolly.  \"Where do you want the elephant to go?\"  \"Where do I want him to go?  Why, home of course, before he does any more mischief.  I wish he was dead; that I do!  And he shall be too. Here, Jem, run back to Number One--here's the key--and bring my rifle and the powder-flask and bullet-bag.  I'm sick of him.  He'll be killing somebody before he's done--a beast!--Tigers is angels to him, sir,\" he continued appealingly to Morris.  \"He's the wickedest elephant I ever see, and I've spent more on him in damages than I paid for him at first; but he's played his last prank, and if I can't drive him I can shoot.--'Member that lion, my lads, as killed the gentleman's hoss?\"  \"Ay, ay, ay!\" came in a low murmured growl.  \"Got out, sir,\" continued the proprietor, waving one hand about oratorically, and dabbing his bald head with his hand.  \"Here, some of you, where's my yellow handkerchy?  Oh, I know; I left it in that there apple-wood, and I'd lay sixpence, he's picked it up and swallowed it because it's yellow and he thinks it's the skin of a big orange.  Got out of his cage, he did, sir, that there lion--been fiddling all night, I suppose, at the bolts and bars--and we followed him up to where he got in the loose-box of a gentleman's stable; and there was the poor horse down--a beauty he was--and that there lion--Arena his name was--lying on him with his face flattened out and teeth buried in the poor hoss's throat, so that when I got to the stable door there he was, all eyes and whiskers, and growling at you like thunder.  I knowed what my work was, sir,\" continued the proprietor, addressing his conversation entirely to Morris, \"and you can ask my men, sir; they was there.\"  \"Ay, ay, ay!\" was growled.  \"It warn't the time for showing no white feathers when a lion's got his monkey up like that.  I brought my gun with me--fine old flint-lock rifle it is, and I got it now--and the next minute that there dead horse had got a dead lion lying beside him.  But I sold his skin to a gent for a ten-pun note, to have it stuffed, and it's in his front hall now, near Lungpuddle, in Lancashire.--Well, you, are you going to fetch that there rifle, or am I to fetch it myself?\" he yelled at his man.  \"Oh, I wouldn't shoot him, guv'nor,\" growled the man.  \"What's it got to do with you?\" almost shrieked his master.  \"Oh, I aren't going to lose nothing, guv'nor, only a bit of a chum. He's knocked me about a bit, and tried to squeeze all the wind out of me two or three times; but that was only his fun.  I shouldn't like to see him hurt.\"  \"Then perhaps you'd like to go and fetch him out of that there urcherd?\" cried his master.  \"He aren't in,\" said the man sturdily; \"and if he were, no, thank you, to-day.  To-morrow morning perhaps I shouldn't mind; but I do say that it'd be a burning shame to shoot the finest elephant there is in England.  The one at the Slogical Gardens in London is nothing to him, and you know, master, that that's the truth.\"  \"You fetch my rifle.\"  \"I wouldn't talk quite so loud, guv'nor, if I was you,\" replied the man. \"Elephants is what they call 'telligent beasts, and you don't know but what that there annymile is a-hearing every word you say and only waiting till I'm gone to make a roosh, knock you down, and do his war-dance all over you.\"  \"Hah!  The same as they trample the life out of the tigers at home.\"  Every one turned sharply upon the speaker, whose voice sounded clear and ringing, as he stood there frowning angrily at the elephant's master.  \"Bah!  Stuff!\" cried the man in his high-pitched voice.  \"I have read anecdotes about animals, and I know all them stories by heart.  They look as if they could; but them beasts can't think, and the stories are all lies.--You be off and fetch that rifle before I send somebody else; and look here, Jem, if you don't obey my orders you take a fortnight's notice to quit from next Saturday, when you are paid.\"  \"Then you are going to shoot the elephant,\" cried Glyn, \"because you don't know how to manage him?\"  \"What!\" half-shrieked the man.  \"Here, I say, where do you go to school? Things are coming to a pretty pass when boys like you begin teaching me, who've been nigh forty year in the wild-beast trade!  What next?\"  \"Glyn Severn's right,\" said Singh sternly.  \"Here's another of them!\" cried the man, looking round from face to face.  \"Quite right,\" continued Singh.  \"Why, the poorest coolie in my father's dominions would manage one of the noble beasts far better.\"  \"Ho!\" said Ramball sarcastically.  \"Then perhaps the biggest swell out of my father's dominions would like to show me how to do it himself.\"  \"I don't know that I can,\" said Singh quietly; \"but I dare say the poor beast would obey me if I tried.\"  \"Oh, pray try, then, sir.--Only, look here, governor,\" continued the man, addressing Morris, who was not far off, \"I don't know whether he's your son or your scholar--I wash my hands of it.  I warn you; he's a vicious beast, and I aren't a-going to pay no damages if my young cock-a-hoop comes to grief.\"  Singh laughed a curious, disdainful laugh.  Then he took a step in the direction of the elephant, but Glyn caught him by the arm.  \"Don't do that, Glyn,\" said the boy quietly.  \"I don't believe he would hurt me.  Come with me if you like.  You know what he'll do if he's going to be savage, and you run one way and I'll run the other.\"  This was in a low voice, unheard by any one but him for whom it was intended; and the next moment, amidst a profound hush, the two boys moved towards the elephant, who was swaying his head slowly from side to side, and looking \"ugly,\" as the man Jem afterwards said.  Then out of the silence, urged by a sense of duty, Morris cried in a harsh, cracked, emotional voice, not in the least like his own, \"Severn! Prince!  Come back!  What are you going to do?\"  His last words came as if he were half-choked, and then like the rest he stood gazing, with a strange clammy moisture gathering in his hands and upon his brow, for as the two boys drew near, the elephant suddenly raised its head, threw up its trunk, and uttered a shrill trumpeting sound.  As the defiant cry ceased, Singh stepped forward in advance of his companion, and shouted a few words in Hindustani.  The elephant lowered its trunk and stood staring at the boy, as if wonderingly, before coming slowly forward in its heavy, ponderous way, crashing down the green herbage beneath the orchard trees,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21315"],["title","The King's Sons (#0)"],["body","King's Sons, by George Manville Fenn.  ________________________________________________________________________  This is a very short book, and it does not contain any of the usual nail-biting Fenn-style situations.  But it is very good at what it does, which is to tell a story about King Ethelwulf of Wessex and his four sons, each of whom in turn became King.  The story concentrates on the youngest of the sons, Alfred, who became known as Alfred the Great during his reign.  The four boys have a tutor, Father Swythe, but only Alfred is interested in what the monk has to teach.  At this point we get a very interesting lesson on how the great illustrated manuscripts were made, how the ink and the colours were made, and how the pens and brushes were made.  Father Swythe later became Bishop of Winchester, and was known as Swithun.  He was canonised, and somehow there has grown a legend that if it rains on Saint Swithun's day it will rain for forty days after that. He is portrayed as rather a portly monk in this story, but his effigy in Winchester Cathedral shows him as a very slight man.  There is another story about him which makes him out to be rather a small man, who couldn't reach the key-hole of the cathedral, which obligingly slid down for him.  Anyway, the story is a good one, and you will enjoy it.  This website is called Athelstane, after Alfred's grandson, so we were interested to transcribe this story.  NH  ________________________________________________________________________  THE KING'S SONS, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.    CHAPTER ONE.  SONS OF THE KING.  The sun shone down hotly on the hill-side, and that hill was one of a range of smooth rolling downs that ought to have been called ups and downs, from the way they seemed to rise and fall like the sea on a fine calm day.  Not quite, for at such a time the sea looks as blue as the sky above it, while here on this particular hot day, though the sky was as blue as a sapphire stone, the hills were of a beautiful soft green, the grass being short and soft, and as velvety as if Nature had been all over it regularly with her own particular mowing-machine.  But the only mowing that had been done to that grass was by the cropping teeth of the many flocks of sheep whose fleeces dotted the downs with soft white where they nibbled away, watched by the shepherds in their long smock frocks with turn-down collars and pleatings and gatherings on breast and back, and slit up at the sides from the bottom so as to give the men's legs room to move freely when they ran after a restive sheep to hook him with the long crook they carried and bring him kicking and struggling by hook or by crook to the grass.  It was just over a thousand years ago, and, in spite of all the changes fashion has made, plenty of shepherds and farm labourers still wear the simple old Saxon dress then worn by King Ethelwulf's serfs, though without the girdle worn then.  There were four boys on the steepest slope of that hill-side--four fair-haired, sun-browned, hearty-looking boys--and they wore smock frocks, belted in at the waist, of fine, soft, woollen material, woven out of the fleeces of the sheep; for they were King's sons, the sons of the King whose flocks were feeding on the hill-side in Berkshire, where he had his Court.  It was as peaceful there as it was soft and beautiful; for though news came from time to time of the cruel acts of the fierce Norsemen who had come across the sea in their great row and sailing galleys full of fighting-men, they were far away from the King's home, so that Queen Osburga felt no anxiety about her boys being out on the downs at play, enjoying themselves and growing strong.  This she loved to see; though, being a very learned woman herself in days when noble people thought no shame to have to say: \"I cannot read or write,\" she sighed to find how very little her four sons cared for such things as gave her delight.  They all loved to be out in the open air along with Cerda, the Saxon jarl, one of the King's chief fighting-men, who urged them to learn how to use the broadsword.  After setting one of the men to make swords for the boys--not of hard cutting steel, but of good tough ash-wood--and then matching them two against two, he would sit and roar with laughter at the blows they gave and took.  \"Well done!  At him again!\" he cried.  \"Another wound; but it will not bleed.\"  It was Cerda, too, who had bows and arrows made for the boys, whilst King Ethelwulf would look on, sometimes smiling and sometimes sighing, for he cared nothing for these things.  \"But we must have fighting-men, Swythe,\" he said, to a little plump, rosy-looking monk in a long gown held tightly to his waist by a knotted rope, which cut in a good way, for the monk was very fat.  \"Oh, but fighting's bad, sir, very bad,\" said the monk, passing one of his hands round and round over his shining, closely-shaven crown.  \"Very bad,\" said King Ethelwulf.  \"I hate it; but you know what the Danes have done to so many of your holy house--killing, burning, and carrying off everything that is good.\"  The monk screwed up his face, shook his head, and sighed, while the rosy little man looked so droll that the King smiled.  \"Look here, Swythe,\" he said, \"suppose a horde of the savage wretches came up here to plunder my pleasant home, what would you do?\"  \"Hah!\" said the monk.  \"I am a man of peace, sir; I should run away.\"  \"And leave the Queen and my boys and me to be killed or taken prisoners?\"  \"Hah!  No,\" said the monk.  \"I couldn't do that.  I'm afraid I should take the biggest staff I could lift--or a sword--or an axe--and--and if either of the wretches tried to touch our good Queen or either of my dear boys I should hit him as hard as ever I could.\"  \"With the club?\" said the King.  \"No; I should strike him down with the axe, sir.\"  \"But you might kill him, Swythe.\"  \"And if I did, sir,\" said the little monk fiercely, \"it would be a good thing too; for these Norsemen are wicked pagans, come to kill and slay.\"  \"You see, we must have fighting-men, Swythe,\" said the King; and then he turned to the Queen, who was listening to what they said.  \"Hah! yes, sir,\" said the monk, with a sigh.  \"I suppose we must; and it does my heart good to see how clever the young Princes are with sword and bow; but they spend too much time learning to fight.  If they would only spend half the time learning with me!\"  \"Yes, it would be good,\" said Queen Osburga sadly.  \"But they don't,\" continued the monk.  \"There's only young Alured-- Alfred, as you call him--who will learn at all, and he is nearly as idle as his brothers.\"  \"You cannot say that they are idle,\" said the Queen, smiling gently.  \"Well, perhaps not idle, my daughter,\" said the monk, shaking his head, \"because they do work hard to learn what Jarl Cerda teaches them.\"  \"Yes,\" said King Ethelwulf, \"they are apt to learn how to fight; but you must make them learned, as kings should be, so as to rule wisely and well when the Danes have killed me and they are called upon to reign.\"  \"The Danes never shall kill you, sir,\" cried the little monk fiercely, \"so long as I can stand in their way.\"  The little group now separated, for the King and Queen had many duties to perform in connection with state affairs, and the little monk had to prepare the lessons for the boys.  And that's how matters were on that bright sunny day when King Ethelwulf's sons lay out on the steep hill-side--Bald, Bert, Red, and Fred--four as crisp and tongue-tripping names as four bright Saxon English boys could own, but each with the addition of Athel or Ethel before, except the youngest, in whose name it shortened into Al; and these were their titles, because each was a Prince.    CHAPTER TWO.  \"BOYS WILL BE BOYS.\"  One of the boys' amusements had been for one to shoot an arrow as high up as he could, and for his brothers to follow and try and hit the first one sent.  Fine practice this in marksmanship, but unsatisfactory and tiring after a few tries, for the arrows flew far, and this time they had brought no young serfs' sons to retrieve the arrows, one of which took a long time to find.  But it was found at last, just as the head of a man appeared above the distant ridge; and the boys stopped to look, the head being followed by the shoulders and breast of the man, while behind him there was a fringe of something bright and shimmering in the sunshine.  The next minute the boys began to run, for they saw that the object first seen was a mounted man, and what followed the heads of spears borne by a party of quite a hundred men, whose leader had been seen first owing to his being mounted upon an active little horse.  \"Where's Cerda going?\" shouted one of the boys.  \"There's a fight somewhere,\" said another.  And the other two joined in, crying together:  \"Let's go and see.\"  So, in a state of wild excitement and wonder that they had not heard the news of danger before, the boys raced to head off the body of armed men, the first up being greeted by the big bluff leader with a cheery shout.  \"What now?  What now?\" he cried.  \"Have you boys come to tell us that we are too late, and that the enemy are all slain?  Who was it found the Norsemen's ship?\"  \"Then the Danes have landed?\" cried the eldest boy excitedly.  \"Yes,\" cried his brother.  \"I knew that was it.\"  \"Yes, that's it, boy,\" said the leader, dragging at his horse's head, for the animal was impatient to go on.  \"Where are they?\" cried the youngest boy, with his cheeks flushing and eyes sparkling.  \"A day's journey away, my boy.  The people over Farringdon way have asked for help, and the King sends me.\"  \"That's right,\" cried the boy who had last spoken.  \"We'll go with you.\"  The leader smiled and shook his head, and the band of fine-looking, picked men indulged in a hearty laugh.  \"What are you mocking and gibing at?\" cried the youngest boy fiercely. \"Do you think that because I and my brothers are young we cannot fight?\"  \"Yes,\""]]]
