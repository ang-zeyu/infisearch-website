Once joined, he who failed in being elected an officer was fated to shoulder a firelock.  It was neck or nothing then.  Lincoln set things in a new light.  They were strangers to each other, he affirmed, and my chances of being elected would therefore be as good as any man's.  \"I'll tell yur what it is,\" said he; \"yur kin turn with me ter the rendevooz, an' see for yurself; but if ye'll only jine, an' licker freely, I'll lay a pack o' beaver agin the skin of a mink that they'll illect ye captain of the company.\"  \"Even a lieutenancy,\" I interposed.  \"Ne'er a bit of it, cap.  Go the big figger.  'Tain't more nor yur entitled to.  I kin git yur a good heist among some hunters thet's thur; but thar's a buffalo drove o' them parleyvoos, an' a feller among 'em, one of these hyur creeholes, that's been a-showin' off and fencin' with a pair of skewers from mornin' till night.  I'd be dog-gone glad to see the starch taken out o' that feller.\"  I took my resolution.  In half an hour after I was standing in a large hall or armoury.  It was the rendezvous of the volunteers, nearly all of whom were present; and perhaps a more variegated assemblage was never grouped together.  Every nationality seemed to have its representative; and for variety of language the company might have rivalled the masons of Babel.  Near the head of the room was a table, upon which lay a large parchment, covered with signatures.  I added mine to the list.  In the act I had staked my liberty.  It was an oath.  \"These are my rivals--the candidates for office,\" thought I, looking at a group who stood near the table.  They were men of better appearance than the _hoi polloi_.  Some of them already affected a half-undress uniform, and most wore forage-caps with glazed covers, and army buttons over the ears.  \"Ha!  Clayley!\" said I, recognising an old acquaintance.  This was a young cotton-planter--a free, dashing spirit,--who had sacrificed a fortune at the shrines of Momus and Bacchus.  \"Why, Haller, old fellow! glad to see you.  How have you been?  Think of going with us?\"  \"Yes, I have signed.  Who is that man?\"  \"He's a Creole; his name is Dubrosc.\"  It was a face purely Norman, and one that would halt the wandering eye in any collection.  Of oval outline, framed by a profusion of black hair, wavy and perfumed.  A round black eye, spanned by brows arching and glossy.  Whiskers that belonged rather to the chin, leaving bare the jawbone, expressive of firmness and resolve.  Firm thin lips, handsomely moustached; when parted, displaying teeth well set and of dazzling whiteness.  A face that might be called beautiful; and yet its beauty was of that negative order which we admire in the serpent and the pard. The smile was cynical; the eye cold, yet bright; but the brightness was altogether _animal_--more the light of instinct than intellect.  A face that presented in its expression a strange admixture of the lovely and the hideous--physically fair, morally dark--beautiful, yet brutal!  From some undefinable cause, I at once conceived for this man a strange feeling of dislike.  It was he of whom Lincoln had spoken, and who was likely to be my rival for the captaincy.  Was it this that rendered him repulsive?  No.  There was a cause beyond.  In him I recognised one of those abandoned natures who shrink from all honest labour, and live upon the sacrificial fondness of some weak being who has been enslaved by their personal attractions.  There are many such.  I have met them in the _jardins_ of Paris; in the _casinos_ of London; in the cafes of Havanna, and the \"quadroon\" balls of New Orleans--everywhere in the crowded haunts of the world.  I have met them with an instinct of loathing--an instinct of antagonism.  \"The fellow is likely to be our captain,\" whispered Clayley, noticing that I observed the man with more than ordinary attention.  \"By the way,\" continued he, \"I don't half like it.  I believe he's an infernal scoundrel.\"  \"Such are my impressions.  But if that be his character, how can he be elected?\"  \"Oh! no one here knows another; and this fellow is a splendid swordsman, like all the Creoles, you know.  He has used the trick to advantage, and has created an impression.  By the by, now I recollect, you are no slouch at that yourself.  What are you up for?\"  \"Captain,\" I replied.  \"Good!  Then we must go the `whole hog' in your favour.  I have put in for the first lieutenancy, so we won't run foul of each other.  Let us `hitch teams'.\"  \"With all my heart,\" said I.  \"You came in with that long-bearded hunter.  Is he your friend?\"  \"He is.\"  \"Then I can tell you that among these fellows he's a `whole team, and a cross dog under the waggon' to boot.  See him! he's at it already.\"  I had noticed Lincoln in conversation with several leather-legging gentry like himself, whom I knew from their costume and appearance to be backwoodsmen.  All at once these saturnine characters commenced moving about the room, and entering into conversation with men whom they had not hitherto deigned to notice.  \"They are canvassing,\" said Clayley.  Lincoln, brushing past, whispered in my ear, \"Cap'n, I understan' these hyur critters better'n you kin.  Yer must mix among 'em--mix and licker--thet's the idee.\"  \"Good advice,\" said Clayley; \"but if you could only take the shine out of that fellow at fencing, the thing's done at once.  By Jove!  I think you might do it, Haller!\"  \"I have made up my mind to try, at all events.\"  \"Not until the last day--a few hours before the election.\"  \"You are right.  It would be better to wait; I shall take your advice. In the meantime let us follow that of Lincoln--`mix and licker'.\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Clayley; \"let us come, boys,\" he added, turning to a very thirsty-looking group, \"let's all take a `smile'.  Here, _Captain_ Haller! allow me to introduce you;\" and the next moment I was introduced to a crowd of very seedy-looking gentlemen, and the moment after we were clinking glasses, and chatting as familiarly as if we had been friends of forty years' standing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  During the next three days the enrolment continued, and the canvass was kept up with energy.  The election was to take place on the evening of the fourth.  Meanwhile my dislike for my rival had been strengthened by closer observation; and, as is general in such cases, the feeling was reciprocal.  On the afternoon of the day in question we stood before each other, foil in hand, both of us nerved by an intense, though as yet _unspoken_, enmity.  This had been observed by most of the spectators, who approached and formed a circle around us; all of them highly interested in the result--which, they knew, would be an index to the election.  The room was an armoury, and all kinds of weapons for military practice were kept in it.  Each had helped himself to his foil.  One of the weapons was without a button, and sharp enough to be dangerous in the hands of an angry man.  I noticed that my antagonist had chosen this one.  \"Your foil is not in order; it has lost the button, has it not?\"  I observed.  \"Ah! monsieur, pardon.  I did not perceive that.\"  \"A strange oversight,\" muttered Clayley, with a significant glance.  The Frenchman returned the imperfect foil, and took another.  \"Have you a choice, monsieur?\"  I inquired.  \"No, thank you; I am satisfied.\"  By this time every person in the rendezvous had come up, and waited with breathless anxiety.  We stood face to face, more like two men about to engage in deadly duel than a pair of amateurs with blunt foils.  My antagonist was evidently a practised swordsman.  I could see that as he came to guard.  As for myself, the small-sword exercise had been a foible of my college days, and for years I had not met my match at it; but just then I was out of practice.  We commenced unsteadily.  Both were excited by unusual emotions, and our first thrusts were neither skilfully aimed nor parried.  We fenced with the energy of anger, and the sparks crackled from the friction of the grazing steel.  For several minutes it was a doubtful contest; but I grew cooler every instant, while a slight advantage I had gained irritated my adversary.  At length, by a lucky hit, I succeeded in planting the button of my foil upon his cheek.  A cheer greeted this, and I could hear the voice of Lincoln shouting out:  \"Wal done, cap'n!  Whooray for the mountain-men!\"  This added to the exasperation of the Frenchman, causing him to strike wilder than before; and I found no difficulty in repeating my former thrust.  It was now a sure hit; and after a few passes I thrust my adversary for the third time, drawing blood.  The cheer rang out louder than before.  The Frenchman could no longer conceal his mortification; and, grasping his foil in both hands, he snapped it over his knee, with an oath.  Then, muttering some word about \"better weapons\" and \"another opportunity\", he strode off among the spectators.  Two hours after the combat I was his captain.  Clayley was elected first lieutenant, and in a week from that time the company was \"mustered\" into the service of the United States government, and armed and equipped as an independent corps of \"Rifle Rangers\".  On the 20th of January, 1847, a noble ship was bearing us over the blue water, toward the shores of a hostile land.    CHAPTER FOUR.  LIFE ON THE ISLAND OF LOBOS.  After calling at Brazos Santiago, we were ordered to land upon the island of Lobos, fifty miles north of Vera Cruz.  This was to be our \"drill rendezvous.\"  We soon reached the island.  Detachments from several regiments debarked together; the jungle was attacked; and in a few hours the green grove had disappeared, and in its place stood the white pyramids of canvas with their floating flags.  It was the work of a day.  When the sun rose over Lobos it was a desert isle, thickly covered with a jungle of mangrove,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21241"],["title","The Rifle Rangers (#5)"],["body","anel, and icaco trees, green as an emerald.  How changed the scene!  When the moon looked down upon this same islet it seemed as if a warlike city had sprung suddenly out of the sea, with a navy at anchor in front of its bannered walls!  In a few days six full regiments had encamped upon the hitherto uninhabited island, and nothing was heard but the voice of war.  These regiments were all \"raw\"; and my duty, with others, consisted in \"licking them into shape\".  It was drill, drill, from morning till night; and, by early tattoo, I was always glad to crawl into my tent and go to sleep--such sleep as a man can get among scorpions, lizards, and soldier-crabs; for the little islet seemed to have within its boundaries a specimen of every reptile that came safely out of the ark.  The 22nd of February being Washington's birthday, I could not get to bed as usual.  I was compelled to accept an invitation, obtained by Clayley, to the tent of Major Twing, where they were--using Clayley's own words--\"to have a night of it.\"  After tattoo we set out for the major's marquee, which lay near the centre of the islet, in a coppice of caoutchouc-trees.  We had no difficulty in finding it, guided by the jingling of glasses and the mingling of many voices in boisterous laughter.  As we came near, we could perceive that the marquee had been enlarged by tucking up the flaps in front, with the addition of a fly stretched over an extra ridge-pole.  Several pieces of rough plank, spirited away from the ship, resting upon empty bread-barrels, formed the table.  Upon this might be recognised every variety of bottles, glasses, and cups.  Open boxes of sardines, piles of ship-biscuits, and segments of cheese filled the intervening spaces.  Freshly-drawn corks and glistening fragments of lead were strewed around, while a number of dark conical objects under the table told that not a few champagne bottles were already \"down among the dead men.\"  On each side of the table was a row of colonels, captains, subalterns, and doctors seated without regard to rank or age, according to the order in which they had \"dropped in\".  There were also some naval officers, and a sprinkling of strange, half-sailor-looking men, the skippers of transport brigs, steamboats, etcetera; for Twing for a thorough republican in his entertainments; besides, the _day_ levelled all distinctions.  At the head of the table was the major himself, who always carried a large pewter flask suspended from his shoulders by a green string, and without this flask no one ever saw Major Twing.  He could not have stuck to it more closely had it been his badge of rank.  It was not unusual, on the route, to hear some wearied officer exclaim, \"If I only had a pull at old Twing's pewter!\" and \"equal to Twing's flask\" was an expression which stamped the quality of any liquor as superfine.  Such was one of the major's peculiarities, though by no means the only one.  As my friend and I made our appearance under the fly, the company was in high glee, everyone enjoying himself with that freedom from restraint of rank peculiar to the American army-service.  Clayley was a great favourite with the major, and at once caught his eye.  \"Ha, Clayley! that you?  Walk in with your friend.  Find seats there, gentlemen.\"  \"Captain Haller--Major Twing,\" said Clayley, introducing me.  \"Happy to know you, Captain.  Can you find seats there?  No.  Come up this way.  Cudjo, boy! run over to Colonel Marshall's tent, and steal a couple of stools.  Adge, twist the neck off that bottle.  Where's the screw?  Hang that screw!  Where is it anyhow?\"  \"Never mind the screw, Mage,\" cried the adjutant; \"I've got a patent universal here.\"  So saying, this gentleman held out a champagne bottle in his left hand, and with a down-stroke of his right cut the neck off, as square as if it had been filed.  \"Nate!\" ejaculated Hennessy, an Irish officer, who sat near the head of the table, and who evidently admired that sort of thing.  \"What we call a Kentucky corkscrew,\" said the adjutant coolly.  \"It offers a double advantage.  It saves time, and you got the wine clear of--\"  \"My respects, gentlemen!  Captain Haller--Mr Clayley.\"  \"Thank you, Major Twing.  To you, sir.\"  \"Ha! the stools at last!  Only one!  Come, gentlemen, squeeze yourselves up this way.  Here, Clayley, old boy; here's a cartridge-box.  Adge! up-end that box.  So--give us your fist, old fellow; how are you?  Sit down, Captain; sit down.  Cigars, there!\"  At that moment the report of a musket was heard without the tent, and simultaneously a bullet whistled through the canvas.  It knocked the foraging-cap from the head of Captain Hennessy, and, striking a decanter, shivered the glass into a thousand pieces!  \"A nate shot that, I don't care who fired it,\" said Hennessy, coolly picking up his cap.  \"An inch of a miss--good as a mile,\" added he, thrusting his thumb into the bullet-hole.  By this time every officer present was upon his feet, most of them rushing towards the front of the marquee.  A dozen voices called out together:  \"Who fired that gun?\"  There was no answer, and several plunged into the thicket in pursuit. The chaparral was dark and silent, and these returned after a fruitless search.  \"Some soldier, whose musket has gone off by accident,\" suggested Colonel Harding.  \"The fellow has run away, to avoid being put under arrest.\"  \"Come, gentlemen, take your sates again,\" said Hennessy; \"let the poor divil slide--yez may be thankful it wasn't a shell.\"  \"You, Captain, have most cause to be grateful for the character of the missile.\"  \"By my sowl, I don't know about that!--a shell or a twenty-four would have grazed me all the same; but a big shot would have been mighty inconvanient to the head of my friend Haller, here!\"  This was true.  My head was nearly in range; and had the shot been a large one, it would have struck me upon the left temple.  As it was, I felt the \"wind\" of the bullet, and already began to suffer a painful sensation over the eye.  \"I'm mighty curious to know which of us the fellow has missed, Captain,\" said Hennessy, turning to me as he spoke.  \"If it were not a `bull' I should say I hope neither of us.  I'm inclined to think, with Colonel Harding, that it was altogether an accident.\"  \"By the powers! an ugly accident too, that has spoiled five dollars' worth of an illigant cap, and a pint of as good brandy as ever was mixed with hot water and lemon-juice.\"  \"Plenty left, Captain,\" cried the major.  \"Come, gentlemen, don't let this damp us; fill up! till up!  Adge, out with the corks!  Cudjo, where's the screw?\"  \"Never mind the screw, Mage,\" cried the adjutant, repeating his old trick upon the neck of a fresh bottle, which, nipped off under the wire, fell upon a heap of others that had preceded it.  And the wine again foamed and sparkled, and glasses circled round, and the noisy revelry waxed as loud as ever.  The incident of the shot was soon forgotten.  Songs were sung, and stories told, and toasts drunk; and with song and sentiment, and toast and story, and the wild excitement of wit and wine, the night waned away.  With many of those young hearts, old with hope and burning with ambition, it was the last \"Twenty-second\" they would ever celebrate.  Half of them never hailed another.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A SKELETON ADVENTURE.  It was past midnight when I withdrew from the scene of wassail.  My blood was flushed, and I strolled down upon the beach to enjoy the cool fresh breeze that was flowing in from the Mexican Sea.  The scene before me was one of picturesque grandeur, and I paused a moment to gaze upon it.  The wine even heightened its loveliness to an illusion.  The full round moon of the tropics was sweeping over a sky of cloudless blue.  The stars were eclipsed and scarcely visible, except a few of the larger ones, as the belt of Orion, the planet Venus, and the luminous radii of the Southern Cross.  From my feet a broad band of silver stretched away to the horizon, marking the meridian of the moon.  This was broken by the line of coral reef, over which the surf curled and sparkled with a phosphoric brightness.  The reef itself, running all round, seemed to gird the islet in a circle of fire.  Here only were the waves in motion, as if pressed by some subaqueous and invisible power; for beyond, scarcely a breath stirred the sleeping sea.  It lay smooth and silent, while a satellite sky seemed caved out in its azure depths.  On the south, a hundred ships were in the deep roadstead, a cable's length from each other--their hulls, spars, and rigging magnified to gigantic proportions under the deceptive and tremulous moonbeam.  They were motionless as if the sea had been frozen around them into a solid crystal.  Their flags drooped listlessly down, trailing along the masts, or warped and twined around the halyards.  Up against the easy ascent extended the long rows of white tents, shining under the silvery moonbeam like pyramids of snow.  In one a light was still gleaming through the canvas, where, perchance, some soldier sat up, wearily wiping his gun, or burnishing the brasses upon his belts.  Now and then dark forms--human and uniformed--passed to and fro from tent to tent, each returning from a visit to some regimental comrade. At equal distances round the camp others stood upright and motionless, the gleam of the musket showing the sentry on his silent post.  The plunge of an oar, as some boat was rowed out among the anchored ships--the ripple of the light breaker--at intervals the hail of a sentinel, \"Who goes there?\"--the low parley that followed--the chirp of the cicada in the dark jungle--or the scream of the sea-bird, scared by some submarine enemy from its watery rest--were the only sounds that disturbed the deep stillness of the night.  I continued my walk along the beach until I had reached that point of the island directly opposite to the mainland of Mexico.  Here the chaparral grew thick and tangled, running down to the "]]]
