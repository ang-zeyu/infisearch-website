In 1826 a special Act of Parliament empowered the owner, Lord Grosvenor, to drain the site, raise the level, etc., and in the course of the next few years Messrs. Cubitt and Seth Smith built the streets and squares which now rank as a fashionable centre with the neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square. The houses are mainly uniform in type--square, substantial, plaster-fronted structures, which give an aspect of monotony to the whole district.  Belgrave Square, 10 acres in extent, is 684 feet long by 637 feet wide, and was designed by Basevi and built by Cubitt in 1825-28. The detached houses in the corners are by Philip Hardwick, R.A., and H. E. Kendall (west side). An enclosed garden occupies the centre.  Inhabitants: No. 5, General Sir George Murray, d. 1846, Earl of Shaftesbury, d. 1886; 15, Duke of Bedford; 16, Sir Roderick Murchison, geologist, d. 1871; 12 (western corner house), the late Earl Brownlow, Earl of Ancaster; 18, Austro-Hungarian Embassy; 23, Viscountess Hambledon, widow of Right Hon. W. H. Smith; 32, Admiral Earl of Clanwilliam.  The south corner house was built for Mr. Kemp of Kemptown. No. 24 General Lord Hill occupied in 1837. After his death, Lord Ducie occupied it till 1853; 36, H.R.H. Duchess of Kent, 1840; 37, Earl of Sefton, 1896; 45, Duchess of Montrose, d. 1895; 48, Viscount Combermere, d. 1891; 49 was built in 1850 for Mr. Sidney Herbert, Duke of Richmond and Gordon; Earl of March.  The principal approach to Belgrave Square is by Grosvenor Crescent, a broad and handsome street commenced in 1837, but not completed until about 1860. Where is now the south-west wing of St. George's Hospital stood Tattersall's famous auction mart for horses, etc., and betting-rooms. The establishment was started by Richard Tattersall, trainer to the last Duke of Kingston, about 1774, and was long popularly known as \"the Corner.\" It was pulled down in 1866, and removed to Knightsbridge Green.  Inhabitants: No. 5, Lord Ashbourne; 8, Right Hon. Sir George Trevelyan, Bart., M.P.; 11, Duke of Leeds; 14, C. Bulkeley Barrington, M.P.; 15, Grosvenor Crescent Club for Ladies. Behind the north-west side of the Square is Wilton Crescent, with a garden in the centre, and Wilton Place, both built by Seth Smith between 1824 and 1828.  Inhabitants, Wilton Crescent: No. 16, Right Hon. James Lowther, M.P.; 24, Henry Hallam, d. 1859; 20, Sir George Wombwell, Bart.; 26, Lord Lamington; 28, Lord De Ros; 30, Lord John Russell; 37, Lord Chewton, who was killed at the Battle of the Alma; 39, Rev. W. J. Bennett, 1850.  Wilton Place stands on the site of a cow-yard, and is a broad street with fine houses on the east side. Here is St. Paul's Church, celebrated for the ritualistic tendencies of its successive vicars. It was built in 1843 by subscription on the drill ground of the old barracks, and cost £11,000, the site being given by the Marquis of Westminster. The building by Cundy is handsome, in Early Perpendicular style, and has sittings for 1,800. It was enlarged and altered in 1889 and 1892, when a side-chapel, by Blomfield, was added. Adjoining is the Vicarage, and opposite are St. Paul's National Schools.  Here lived: No. 4, Miss Reynolds, actress; 13, Hon. Thomas Stapleton, antiquary; 15, Sir James Macdonald, the defender of Hougoumont, d. 1857; 21, Mr. Westmacott.  In the adjoining Kinnerton Street (1826), so called from one of the Grosvenor estates, stood the dissecting school and anatomical museum of St. George's Hospital, removed to the new wing in 1868. At No. 75 is an institute for providing and promoting humane treatment of animals, founded by Lady Frances Trevanion _circa_ 1890. It is supported by voluntary contributions.  Motcomb Street was built in 1828, and named after the property of the Dowager Marchioness of Westminster in Dorset.  On the north side is the Pantechnicon, built _circa_ 1834 as a bazaar for the sale of carriages, furniture, etc.; it had also a wine and toy department. It was burnt down in 1874, but has been rebuilt, and is now used for storing furniture, etc.  West Halkin Street and Halkin Place on the west side, and Halkin Street on the east side of the Square, are named after Halkin Castle, the Duke of Westminster's seat in Flintshire. The first contains a chapel of singular shape, the northern end being wider than the southern. It was built by Seth Smith as an Episcopal church, but is now Presbyterian.  Halkin Street was commenced about 1807, but until 1826 it, as well as the other streets leading out of Grosvenor Place, terminated in a mud-bank, on the other side of which were the Five Fields. On the north side is Mortimer House, a plain brick building standing in a courtyard. It was the residence of the late Earl Fitzwilliam, but is now Lord Penrhyn's. Next to it is Belgrave Chapel (St. John's), a proprietary church in Grecian style, built in 1812, with accommodation for 800. The remaining houses are small and unpretending, as are those in Chapel Street, built 1775-1811, and so called from the Lock Hospital Chapel, which stood at the corner of Grosvenor Place. Here lived Mr. Richard Jones (Gentleman Jones). No. 24, General Sir W. K. Grant, d. 1825.  On the other side of Belgrave Square, Chesham Place (1831) leads to a triangular space, with a small garden in the centre. Here lived: Madame Vestris, 1837; No. 37, Lord John Russell; 35, Sir Charles Wood, 1851; 29, the Russian Embassy.  The name is taken from the seat of the Lowndes family, the ground landlords. In Lowndes Street lived: No. 33, Colonel Gurwood, editor of \"Wellington's Despatches\"; 40, Mrs. Gore, novelist.  In Chesham Street, at No. 7, lived Henry Parish, diplomatist.  The feature of Lyall Street (1841) is Chesham House, at the corner, in which is the Russian Embassy, noted under Chesham Place. On the other side of Lyall Street is Lowndes Place, built about 1835. Eaton Place is a dull but broad and fashionable street.  Inhabitants: General Caulfield; Sir Robert Gardiner, Sir H. Duncan, d. 1836; Sir Thomas Troubridge, d. 1852; No. 5, Mr. Heywood, 1859; 14, Sir George Grey, 1859; 15, Lord Kelvin; 18, Dr. Lushington, 1859; 26, Sir Erskine Perry, 1859; 38, Mr. Justice Wightman, 1859; 80, Kossuth, 1851; 84, Duke of Atholl; 87, Sir William Molesworth, d. 1853; 93, General Sir Archibald Alison, Bart.; and many others.  Off Eaton Place is West Eaton Place, where lived General Sir Peregrine Maitland, d. 1852.  Belgrave Place, so named in 1879 instead of Upper Eccleston Street; and Upper Belgrave Street, built _circa_ 1827, have the same general characteristics.  Inhabitants: No. 2, Mrs. Gore; 3, Lord Charles Wellesley; 13, Earl of Munster, son of William IV., who shot himself in 1842. It is now Lord Harewood's residence.  In Chester Street, commenced 1805, lived: No. 5, Right Hon. Sir Frederick Shaw, d. 1876; 7, Dr. Pettigrew, d. 1860; 12, Sir Douglas Galton, d. 1899; 13, Dr. Broughton, d. 1837; 27, Colonel Sibthorpe, d. 1855.  Wilton Street was begun in 1817. Here lived Mr. Spencer Perceval, son of the Minister.  Grosvenor Place, Lower Grosvenor Place, Hobart Place, Eaton Square, and Clieveden Place occupy the site of the King's private road, which had existed before as a footpath, but was made a coach-road by Charles II. as a short-cut to Hampton Court. It ran along the north garden of Eaton Square, and crossed the Westbourne at Bloody Bridge, a name which dates as far back as 1590. On the north side, where is now Eaton Terrace, was a coppice which provided wood for the Abbey. Houses were first built on it about 1785, and in 1725 a turnpike existed at its junction with Grosvenor Place. Admission to the road was by ticket, but in 1830 it was thrown open to the public under the name of the King's Road. Part of Lower Grosvenor Place, however, was named Arabella Row in 1789, but became known by its present name in 1789. Here in a shabby house lived Lord Erskine after resigning the Lord Chancellorship in 1806.  Hobart Place was first so called in 1836, but part of it was called Grosvenor Street West until 1869. It leads to Eaton Square, built by Cubitt in 1827-53. This is 1,637 feet long by 371 feet wide, 15 acres in extent, and contains six enclosed gardens. The houses are of the usual type. At the west end is St. Peter's Church, built in 1826 in Ionic style from designs by Hakewell at a cost of £21,515. An altar-piece by Hilton, R.A., was presented by the British Institution in 1828, but was removed in 1877, and is now in the South Kensington Museum. After being nearly burnt down in 1837, it was rebuilt by Gerrard, and in 1872 a chancel and transepts in Byzantine style, by Sir A. Blomfield, were added. The nave was remodelled in 1874, and further alterations have been made in the last ten years at a cost of £5,000. Here are buried Admiral Sir E. Codrington, d. 1851, and General Lord Robert Somerset, G.C.B. The Right Rev. G. H. Wilkinson, Bishop of St. Andrew's, was vicar from 1870-83.  Inhabitants: No. 8, Sir R. T. Reid, K.C., M.P.; 16, Mr. Justice Willes, 1859; 43, Lord Cottesloe; 60, Lord Sandhurst; 66a, Lord Walsingham, F.R.S.; 71, in 1809 the official residence of the Speaker; 74, Cardwell, 1859; 75, Ralph Bernal, M.P., d. 1853, Mr. George Peabody, d. 1869, Viscount Knutsford; 76, Viscount Falkland; 83, Lord Chancellor Truro, d. 1855; Lord Aberdare; 85, Sir Edward Malet, G.C.B., P.C.; 92, Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, d. 1851; 110, General Sir A. Codrington, 1859; 114, Lady Baden-Powell; 115, Earl of Ellenborough, 1859, Marquis of Hertford; Colonel Sibthorpe, d. 1855; Jacob Omnium (Mr. J. Higgins).  Clieveden Place, first built over in 1826, was so named in 1890 from the Duke of Westminster's late estate near Cookham, instead of its original name, Westbourne Place.  Between Clieveden Place and Pimlico Road the streets are narrow and unimportant. In Westbourne Street (1826), so called from the neighbouring Westbourne River, stood the York Hospital for invalid soldiers, removed to Chatham in 1819.

There are three boys living with their father, now just a little disabled, but an avid collector of natural-history specimens.  The father says he would give almost anything for the hide of a white buffalo, and that such a beast exists cannot be disputed.  The boys volunteer to get up an expedition to bring back the much-desired hide, and off they go.  This book is the story of their quest.  But it is also an interesting exposition of the animals and plants that inhabit the great prairies of America.  The only real fault is that we are inevitably given the Latin name of the plant or animal.  I don't know why I should object to this, but I do.  I don't think it sits well within speech.  Still, the story is really interesting, and I greatly enjoyed transcribing it.  I am sure I will read it many more times before my days are numbered, if I can. NH ________________________________________________________________________  THE BOY HUNTERS ADVENTURES IN SEARCH OF A WHITE BUFFALO  BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID   CHAPTER ONE.  THE HOME OF THE HUNTER-NATURALIST.  Go with me to the great river Mississippi.  It is the longest river in the world.  A line that would measure it would just reach to the centre of the earth,--in other words, it is four thousand miles in length.  Go with me to this majestic river.  I do not wish you to travel to its source; only as far up as Point Coupee, about three hundred miles from its mouth.  There we shall stop for a while--a very short while--for we have a long journey to make. Our route lies to the far west--over the great prairies of Texas; and from Point Coupee we shall take our departure.  There is a village at Point Coupee--a quaint, old, French-looking village built of wood.  In point of fact it _is_ a French village; for it was one of the earliest settlements of that people, who, with the Spaniards, were the first colonists of Western America.  Hence we find, to this day, French and Spanish people, with French and Spanish names and customs, all through the Mississippi valley and the regions that lie west of it.  We have not much to do with these things at present, and very little to say of Point Coupee, more than we have already said.  Our subject is an odd-looking house that, many years ago, stood upon the western bank of the river, about a mile below the village.  I say it stood there many years ago; but it is very likely that it is still standing, as it was a firm, well-built house, of hewn logs, carefully chinked, and plastered between the chinks with run-lime.  It was roofed with cedar shingles that projected at the eaves, so as to cast off the rain, and keep the walls dry.  It was what in that country is called a \"double house,\"-- that is, a large passage ran across the middle of it, through which you might have driven a wagon loaded with hay.  This passage was roofed and ceiled, like the rest of the house, and floored with strong planks.  The flooring, elevated a foot above the surface of the ground, projected several feet in front of the passage, where carved uprights of cedar-wood supported a light roof, forming a porch or verandah.  Around these uprights, and upon the railing that shut in the verandah, clung vines, rose-bushes, and convolvulus plants, that at certain seasons of the year were clustered over with beautiful flowers.  The house faced the river, standing, as I have said, on its western bank--on the same side with Point Coupee.  In front was a lawn, some two hundred yards in length, that stretched toward the river, and ended on the low bluff forming its bank.  This lawn was enclosed by high rail-fences, and variegated with clumps of shrubbery and ornamental trees.  Most of them were indigenous to the country; but there were exotics as well.  Among the trees you could not fail to notice the large-flowered magnolia (_Magnolia grandiflora_), the red mulberry (_Morus rubra_), the pale-green leaves of the catalpa, the tall tulip-tree (_liriodendron_), and the shining foliage of the orange.  In contrast with the brighter frondage of these were dark cone-shaped cedars, and spire-like forms of the yew.  There were date-trees and weeping willows growing upon the river bank, and drooping gracefully over its current.  Other plants and trees might be distinguished--the natives of a southern clime--such as the great Mexican aloe (_Agave Americana_), the bayonet blades of the yucca, and the fan-like leaves of the palmetto.  Beautiful birds of many varieties might be seen among the copses, or moving over the grassy sward of the lawn.  In the great hall or passage, already mentioned, a singular picture presented itself.  Along the walls, on both sides, were suspended various implements of the chase, such as rifles, shot guns, pouches, flasks, hunting-knives, and, in short, every species of trap, net, or implement, that could be devised for capturing the wild denizens of the earth, air, and water.  Horns of the stag and elk were fastened to the hewn logs; and upon their branching antlers hung hair-bridles, and high-peaked saddles of the Mexican or Spanish fashion.  In addition to these were skins of rare birds and quadrupeds, artistically preserved by stuffing, and placed on pedestals around the wooden walls.  There were glass cases, too, containing moths, butterflies, and other insects, impaled upon pins, and arranged in systematic order.  In short, this hall resembled a little museum.  Were we to enter and examine the inside of the house, we should find three or four good-sized rooms, comfortably furnished, and all stocked with subjects of natural history, and implements of the chase.  In one of the rooms we should see a barometer and thermometer hanging against the wall, an old clock over the mantel-piece, a sabre and pistols, and a book-case containing many choice and valuable books.  To the rear of the house we should find a small kitchen built of logs, and containing the usual culinary utensils.  Still farther back we should meet with an enclosed yard, having a storehouse and stable at one end.  In the stables we should find four horses, and several mules might be observed in the enclosure.  A large reddish dog with long ears, and having the appearance of a hound, might be seen straying about the yard, and would not fail to attract our attention.  An observer, viewing this house from a distance, would take it for the residence of a wealthy planter; on a nearer inspection, however, it would not pass for that.  There were no rows of negro cabins, no great sugar-mills, nor tobacco-warehouses, such as are always to be seen near the planter's dwelling.  Nothing of the sort; nor was there any very large tract of cultivated land contiguous to the house.  The dark cypress forest in the background cast its shadow almost up to the walls. Plainly it was not the dwelling of a planter.  What then was it, and who were its inmates?  It was the home of a _Hunter-Naturalist_.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE HUNTER-NATURALIST AND HIS FAMILY.  In 1815 was fought the famous battle of Waterloo, and in the same year Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to the island-rock of Saint Helena.  Many French officers, who had followed the fortunes of the great adventurer, at that time emigrated to America.  Most of these, as was very natural, sought the French settlements on the Mississippi, and there made their homes for life.  Among them was one named Landi, who had been a colonel of chasseurs in Napoleon's army.  He was by birth a Corsican; and it was through his being a friend and early acquaintance of one of the Bonaparte family that he had been induced to become an officer in the French army--for in his youth he had been fonder of science than soldiering.  While campaigning in Spain, Landi had married a Basque lady, by whom he had three children, all sons.  Their mother died before the battle of Waterloo was fought; so that when Landi emigrated to America his family consisted of his three sons alone.  He first went to Saint Louis, but after a while moved down the river to Point Coupee, in Louisiana, where he purchased the house we have just described, and made it his home.  Let me tell you that he was not in any circumstances of necessity. Previous to his departure for America, he had sold his patrimonial estates in Corsica for a sum of money--enough to have enabled him to live without labour in any country, but particularly in that free land of cheap food and light taxation--the land of his adoption.  He was, therefore, under no necessity of following any trade or profession in his new home--and he followed none.  How then did he employ his time?  I will tell you.  He was an educated man.  Previous to his entering the French army he had studied the natural sciences.  He was a _naturalist_. A naturalist can find employment anywhere--can gather both instruction and amusement where others would die of _ennui_ and idleness.  Remember! there are \"sermons in stones, and books in running brooks.\"  He was not a closet naturalist either.  Like the great Audubon he was fond of the outside world.  He was fond of drawing his lessons from Nature herself. He combined a passion for the chase with his more delicate taste for scientific pursuits; and where could he have better placed himself to indulge in these than in the great region of the Mississippi valley, teeming with objects of interest both to the hunter and the naturalist? In my opinion, he made good choice of his home.  Well, between hunting, and fishing, and stuffing his birds, and preserving the skins of rare quadrupeds, and planting and pruning his trees, and teaching his boys, and training his dogs and horses, Landi was far from "]]]
