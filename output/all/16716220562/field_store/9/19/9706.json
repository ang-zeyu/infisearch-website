I'll explain--we will explain.  You shall hear all about it later, but first we must have tea.  I think we shall all feel better after tea.\"  Mrs Saxon looked from one to another of her children with the same strained, unnatural smile which had greeted them a few minutes before, and Gurth and Dreda, falling behind the rest, rolled expressive eyes and whispered low forebodings.  \"Something up!  I thought as much.  What can it be?\"  \"Don't know.  Something horrid, evidently.  In the holidays, too.  What a sell!\"  Miss Bruce had considerately disappeared, and the parents and children were left alone in the big bare library, with its rows of fusty, out-of- date books in early Victorian mahogany bookcases, its three long windows draped in crimson red curtains, its Indian carpet worn by the tramp of many feet.  A cheerful fire blazed in the grate, however, and the tea equipage set out on the long table was sufficiently tempting to raise the spirits of the travellers.  It was a real old-fashioned sit-down tea, where one was not expected to balance a cup and plate on one's knee and yet refrain from spilling tea or scattering crumbs on the carpet. Girls and boys arranged themselves in their usual places with sighs of relief and satisfaction, and, disdaining bread-and-butter, helped themselves energetically to the richest cake on the table.  It was a family custom with the Saxons to begin on cake and work steadily back to bread and butter.  There had been some opposition to encounter from conservative elders before this reversal of the ordinary programme had been sanctioned, but the arguments advanced had been too strong to resist.  \"I can 'preciate things more when I'm hungry.  Cake's the best thing; why need I stodge on bread and butter till I can't properly 'preciate the cake?  Why can't I stodge on cake, and eat the bread when I don't 'preciate?  It doesn't matter about bread!\"  So ran the thread of Harold's arguments, and it must be confessed that there was reason therein.  To-day, as the young people satisfied their first pangs of hunger on iced cake, the parents watching them exchanged a piteous glance, for the proceeding seemed so sadly typical of the secret that was about to be divulged!  Until this day, all that was richest and best in life had been the everyday possession of these loved and fortunate children--after to-day, the love would continue unchanged, but the luxuries must come to an end.  The meal was unusually silent, both Mr and Mrs Saxon and the elder boys and girls being too much oppressed by their own feelings to be able to indulge in ordinary light conversation; only Harold and Maud remained unconscious of the cloud in the atmosphere, and everyone was thankful for their artless prattle, which filled up what would otherwise have been a painful silence.  As for the twins, they were quite elated to find so attentive an audience, for as a rule their attempts to enter the conversation were severely nipped in the bud.  \"That's enough, thank you!\"  Rowena would say in her most lofty manner.  \"Shut up, you kids. A fellow can't hear himself speak for your row!\"  Gurth would call out fiercely.  Even when Mrs Saxon was present she would shake her head gently across the table, to enforce the oft-repeated axiom that in so large a family the younger members must perforce learn to be quiet at table.  Maud beamed with pleasure at being allowed to continue her never-ending descriptions without a word of remonstrance.  She was a fair, pretty, somewhat stupid child, gifted with an overflow of words, which were, however, singularly incapable of conveying any definite impression.  Observation she possessed in abundance, but her discursive narratives were by no means improved by being weighted by a plethora of useless detail.  One could listen to Maud's efforts to describe her own doings for half an hour on end, and remain almost as much in the dark as at the beginning!  On the present occasion she was full of excitement about a wonderful conjurer whose tricks she had witnessed at a children's party in town three nights before, and which she was anxious to enumerate for the benefit of the family.  \"...He was the most egg-strawdinary creature you ever saw.  He did the most egg-strawdinary things.  I'll tell you what he did...  You know the Westons' drawing-room?  You go upstairs--crimson carpets, and such wide brass rods.  Then there's a statue holding up a lamp, and the first door's the drawing-room.  All the doors were taken down to make more room, and there were rows and rows of forms...  He was like a Frenchman with a pointed moustache, but his clothes weren't very clean...  He rolled up his sleeves, and there was a ring on his finger, and yards and yards of ribbon came out of his thumb.  He had a little table in front of him with bulgy legs.  It stands in the corner with silver on it. Then he asked a boy in the front row for a watch...  Mr Weston said he wouldn't have lent _his_, but he got it back all right.  It was egg- strawdinary!  Meta Rawlins sat by me.  She had a pink sash.  She says her father can do it a little bit, only of course not as well as this one.  Then there was an egg.  If he had broken it, it _would_ have made a mess on the carpet!  Meta said perhaps it was stone.  He talked all the time, so funny and quick, and one of his front teeth was out.  He asked if any boy or girl would go up to help him, and Brian Hackett went.  He looked so silly.  He had to hold things in his hand, and when he asked for them, they weren't there.  It was egg-strawdinary!  We had supper in the dining-room, jellies and cream, and presents in the trifle.  I saw the conjurer having his in the library.  I never saw anything so egg-strawdinary in all my life!\"  Gurth and Hereward exchanged expressive glances, Rowena frowned impatience, Mrs Saxon smiled a faint amusement, and Maud continued to prattle on, blissfully unconscious of the fact that no one troubled to listen.  It was after everyone had been fed and refreshed that the explanation of the mysterious summons from town was given, in response to an outspoken question from Dreda, whose impetuous nature was ever impatient of suspense.  \"Mother, what has happened?  There must be something, or you would never have left town and sent for us in such a hurry.  Can't you tell us now? It's something horrid, of course!  And it's horrid waiting for horrid things.\"  Dreda put both elbows on the table, in flagrant disregard of schoolroom rules, and leant her charming, eager face in the cup of her hands.  She might describe her state of mind as \"horrid,\" but an appearance more opposed to such a description it would be impossible to imagine.  Dreda had been hungry, and her hunger was satisfied; she had been cold and tired, now she was warmed and refreshed; she talked vaguely of horrible things, but nothing approaching real fear had as yet entered her heart. Grown-ups made such a fuss about trifles.  Probably it was something quite silly and unimportant after all.  Mrs Saxon did not answer.  She looked down at her hands and twisted the rings on her fingers, the while her husband took upon himself the burden of explanation.  \"Yes, Dreda, we wish to speak out plainly.  As far as possible we have always taken our children into our confidence, and now we must all try to strengthen each other, for a great change is before us.  It must affect us all...  I have lost money--a great deal of money.  I am no longer a rich man.  Your mother and I came down here to face the situation quietly, and to think out our plans.  We wished to be by ourselves for a few days before saying anything to you.\"  \"Oh-h.  Is that it?  Poor father!  What a shame!\"  \"What a beastly fag!  How did it happen, Pater?\"  \"Poor old father!  Yes!  I _quite_ understand.\"  They spoke together with impetuous warmth, Gurth, Hereward, and Etheldreda, but, in spite of their words, none of them understood in the least.  Maud and Harold stared open-mouthed.  Only Rowena turned white, and pressed her lips nervously together.  \"Thank you, dears.  I knew you would sympathise, but our grief is on your account more than on our own.  If you can bear the change bravely, our worst fears will be allayed.  It will be a big change.  To begin with, I have let the town house.  An offer came to take it furnished on a lease, and I dared not refuse.  The Meads will now be our settled home.\"  Silence...  One definite statement has more effect than a dozen vague forebodings, and the young people sat stunned with dismay, while the thoughts of each wandered away on a voyage of personal reflections.  \"No town house!  No season!  Shut up here all the year round, just as I was coming out, and expecting to have such a lovely time.\"  \"Let the house!  Whew!  Things must be precious bad ...  Suppose, after all, the Governor can't afford to send me to the army!\"  \"Here's a pretty go!  The house doesn't matter.  The country knocks town into fits any day, but it will be a beastly fag if we have to cut things down fine.  What about the horses?\"  \"Poor father.  Oh, dear, how awful mother looks!  Rowena is a brute to look so cross.  P'raps the Spider will have to go, and I shall be finished, and done with lessons.  Topping!\"  \"Bateson's father lost his money and he went to sea.  I wonder if they'd let me!\"  \"I've got five pounds six in the bank.  I'll draw it out, and give it to them to help.  That would last for mumfs and mumfs.\"  Mrs Saxon lifted her sad eyes and glanced wistfully round the table. When she herself had first heard the news she had been stunned into silence; she hardly expected words, but her mother's heart yearned for a glance of sympathy and love.  The boys, as is the habit of boys, were rendered awkward and uncomfortable by the atmosphere of emotion, and stared stolidly at their plates.  Rowena sat like a frozen statue of misery, Maud gaped blankly from one face to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21118"],["title","Etheldreda the Ready: A School Story (#3)"],["body","another; only Dreda was ready and waiting with her sunny smile and her easy flow of sympathy.  \"Darling!  Of course we'll be brave!  Don't worry about us.  Everyone says money doesn't matter a bit.  You can be perfectly happy without it...  Perfectly sickening for you and father, down here by yourselves with all that worry.  You must have been bored!\"  Bored!  The utter inadequacy of the word brought a smile to the parents' eyes, but the kindly warmth of voice and manner was as balm to their sore hearts.  What though Dreda's conduct belied her words time and again, her impetuous kindliness of heart was for the moment infinitely soothing, and a blessed contrast to Rowena's gloom.  Both parents smiled lovingly upon her, and Dreda glowed with satisfaction.  Really, being ruined was quite exciting and dramatic!  \"Thank you, Dreda,\" said her father, gratefully.  \"These have been very sad days for us, as you say, and even yet we are feeling rather stunned by the suddenness of this trouble, and have not been able to think out definite plans for your future.  It was necessary to tell you the bare fact, but you must be patient and forbear from questioning for a few days.  We shall not keep you in suspense longer than is necessary.\"  Suspense!  Six pairs of ears pricked uneasily at the sound of that word; six hearers seemed to hear in it the knell of a cherished hope.  Even Dreda was awed into silence.  The \"horrid things\" were evidently not yet finished.  What was going to happen next?    CHAPTER THREE.  In the schoolroom the young people flocked together, eager to discuss the news apart from the restraint of their parents' presence.  Round the great fireplace stood one of those delightful fenders whose top is formed by a wide-cushioned seat.  Hereward pulled it forcibly back, with a fine disregard of cinders, until it was sufficiently distant from the blaze to be comfortable, when the six young people seated themselves and prepared to talk in comfort.  They made a pretty picture as the leaping flame lighted up their fair blond faces, but for the moment the general expression was far from cheerful.  The twins were all eyes and gaping mouths, devoured with curiosity to hear what their elders might have to say with regard to the thrilling intelligence just given; the two schoolboys looked cross and thundery, and it was difficult to say which was the more exasperating to beholders--Rowena's angry frown or Dreda's artificial smiles.  Gurth stamped a smoking cinder into the hearthrug, taking a malicious pleasure in the scorch and smell which ensued.  He was never too patient, and this afternoon he felt that he had reached the end of his tether.  \"Oh, chuck it, Rowena!\" he cried savagely.  \"What's the use of sitting there looking like a tragedy queen?  A jolly example _you_ set, for the eldest of a family.  You look as if the whole thing was got up on purpose to annoy you, and nobody had a right to be pitied except your precious self.  I don't see it a bit!  I think you come off best of all. Your education is finished, so you're bound to be all right!\"  \"Education!\" echoed Rowena, in the tone of ineffable scorn natural to a young woman who for months past had been basking in the prospect of a presentation at court.  \"Education, indeed!  Who cares for education? If it _is_ finished, what has it all been intended for, pray?  To prepare me for a life which I am not to have!  Other girls have the best time of their lives when they come out.  They are taken about to see everything and do everything which they have longed for all the time they have been shut up at school.  It's no wonder I feel bad at coming home to find I have only escaped one prison for another.  To live here all the year long!  What a prospect!  There isn't a decent neighbour nearer than five miles.--If this could only have happened a year or two later, after I had had a _little_ fun!\"  \"Rowena, how selfish!  You think only of yourself, and not a bit of anyone else--father or mother, or the boys, or--or Me!\" cried Dreda, smiting herself on the breast with dramatic _empressement_ as she uttered the last all-important word.  \"It won't be a bit easier for me when the time comes, but I do _hope_ and _believe_ that I shall bear it bravely, and try to be an example to the rest.  It's our duty, you know, as the eldest daughters of the house!\"  \"Oh, Dreda, _stop_ preaching!  It's too ridiculous.  _You_ to lecture me!  For that matter, you need not wait until you are finished to set me an example.  You can begin this very minute, for I don't believe for a moment that father will be able to afford to send you to Madame Clerc's. It's a frightfully expensive school, and he used to grumble at the way my extras ran up, even before, when he was rich.  I expect you will have to finish at home with the Spider, and then she will go, and you will have to set to work to teach Maud!\"  \"I shan't!\" shrieked Dreda, and flamed a sudden violent red.  \"She shan't!\" shrieked Maud, at one and the same moment, her fair, placid face flushing to the same crimson hue.  They faced each other like two infuriated turkey cocks--heads erect, feathers ruffled, bodies swaying to and fro with indignation.  \"As if I should!\"  \"As if I'd let you!\"  \"Teach her!\"  \"Teach me!\"  \"The very idea!\"  \"I'm 'stonished you should talk such nonsense, Rowena!\"  Rowena laughed softly.  It was the first time she had unbent since the telling of the dread news.  She put her head on one side and stared at Dreda's furious face with an \"I told you so!\" expression which that young lady found infinitely exasperating.  \"Our dear Dreda, as usual, finds preaching easier than practice.  You see, my dear, when it comes to the point, you are not a bit more resigned than I am myself.  It's worse for me to give up all the fun of my first season than for you to stay at home instead of going to school; the only difference is that I have sense enough to realise what is before me, while you are so taken up with sentiment and--\"  \"Oh, shut up, girls!  Stop wrangling, for pity's sake!\" cried Hereward, impatiently.  \"Things are bad enough as they are, without making them worse.  If you are going to nag, we'll go downstairs and leave you to yourselves.  It's such bad form to kick up a fuss; but girls are all alike.  You wouldn't find a boy going on like that--\"  Rowena turned upon him with wide, challenging eyes.  \"Wouldn't I?  Are you so sure?  Suppose father were to tell you to- morrow that you couldn't be a soldier, but must go into an office and try to earn money for yourself...  Suppose he took you away from Eton, Gurth, and sent you to a cheap school!  How would you like that?\"  Silence...  The two lads sat staring into the fire with dogged faces. They scorned to cry aloud, but the horror of the prospect had for a moment a so paralysing effect that they could not reply.  Leave Sandhurst in the middle of one's course, and become--a _clerk_!  Leave Eton and the fellows, and go to one of those miserable, second-rate shows which all good Etonians regarded with ineffable contempt!  Was it possible to suffer such degradation and live?  Rowena was touched to compunction by the sight of the stricken faces, for though at the moment the worst side of her character was in the ascendant, she was by no means hard-hearted, and, moreover, Hereward was her especial friend and companion.  She laughed again, and gave an impatient shrug to her shoulders.  \"Oh, don't be afraid ...  He never _will_!  Whatever happens, nothing will be allowed to interfere with `the boys' and their careers!  We shall all pinch and screw and live on twopence-halfpenny a week, so as to be able to pay your bills.  It's always the same story.  Everything is sacrificed for the sons.\"  \"Quite right, too,\" maintained the eldest son, stoutly.  \"How are you going to keep up the honour of a family if you don't give the boys a chance?  It doesn't matter a fig whether a girl is educated or not, so long as she can read and write.  She'll marry, of course, and then she has nothing to do but add up the bills.\"  At this truly masculine distinction, Rowena and Dreda tossed scornful heads and rolled indignant eyes to the ceiling.  \"I shall never marry!\" announced the former, thinking ruefully of the bare countryside, with never a house of consequence within a radius of miles ...  \"I am a suffragette.  I believe in the high, lofty mission of women!\" cried the second, who had been converted to the movement the day before by the sight of some sketches in the _Daily Graphic_.  Only nine- year-old Maud sniffed, and opined, \"I shall marry a lord!  Then he'll have lots of money, and I'll give it to father, and we'll live happily ever after.\"  Poor Maud!  Her millennium was not to begin just yet, at least; for Nannie, her immaculate but austere attendant, rapped at the door at that moment, and summoned her nursling to be bathed and put to bed.  Maud was every evening enraged afresh at being called at such a ridiculously early hour, and to-night her annoyance was increased by the fact that she was torn ruthlessly from the rare treat of a conference with her elders, in which she had really been and truly on the level of a \"grown- up.\"  She fumed with anger, but presently consolation came with the idea of a dramatic disclosure upstairs.  She waited until she and her attendant were alone together in the bedroom, and then sprung the bolt in her most impressive fashion.  \"Nannie, we're ruined!\"  \"Indeed, miss.  Sorry to hear it, I'm sure,\" returned Nannie, unperturbed.  It is safe to predict that any important family news will be known as soon in the servants' hall as in the drawing-room, and Nannie had the air of listening to a very stale piece of information.  Maud was distinctly disappointed, but nerved herself for fresh efforts. \"Yes.  Bankrup'!  There's nothing left.  I'm going to give up all my savings.  What will you do, Nannie--leave?\"  \"I shall be pleased to stay on, miss, as long as your"]]]
