She was Head Girl, and ruled the house, and came out first in the games, and she said she never had such sport in her life, and found the holidays quite fearfully flat and stale in comparison.\"  \"You don't become Head Girl all at once,\" interposed Harold, drily; while Mrs Chester gave another sob at the idea that home could ever be looked upon in so sad a light.  \"Hurst Manor?\" she repeated vaguely.  \"That's a strange name.  I never heard of the place before.  What do you know about it that makes you want to go, darling?  Are you quite sure it is nice, and what is the Head Mistress like, and how many young la-- girls does she take?  Not too many, I hope, for I can't see how they can be properly looked after when there are more than twenty or thirty.  I've heard terrible stories of delicacy for life arising from neglect.  You remember poor, dear Evie Vane!  Her glands swelled, and nobody noticed, and--\"  \"My glands never swell.  They know better.  Over two hundred girls, mother; but they are divided into different houses, with a staff of teachers in charge of each, so there's no fear of being neglected; and it's much more fun living in a crowd.  I'm tired of talking to the same people over and over again, and should love a variety.  Among the hundred girls, one would be sure to find one or two whom one could really like.\"  Harold laughed again, a sleepy laugh, which brought a flash into his sister's eyes.  That was the worst of Harold; he was so superior!  He never argued, nor contradicted, but he had a way of smiling to himself, of throwing back his head and half shutting his eyes, which made Rhoda feel as if throwing cushions at him would be the only adequate relief to her feelings.  She glared at him for a moment, and then turned her back on him in a marked manner and addressed herself to her father.  \"You will write to Miss Bruce at once, won't you, father, and arrange for me to go at the beginning of the term?\"  \"I will write for particulars, or, better still, your mother and I will go down to see the place for ourselves.  I should like you to go to the school you fancy, if it can be arranged, and I suppose this is as good as any.\"  \"Better!\"  Rhoda declared rapturously, \"a thousand times better!  Ella Mason said so; and she knows, because her cousin's sisters have all been at different schools--one at Cheltenham, one at Saint Andrew's, one at Wycombe, and she declares that Hurst beats them all.  It must be so, since it has adopted all the good ideas and abandoned the bad.\"  She went on with a rambling statement which seemed to imply that Miss Bruce had been in turn sole proprietor of each of these well-known schools before abandoning them in favour of her new establishment; that Hurst Manor buildings had been recently erected, at vast expense, to provide every possible convenience for the pupils, and at the same time was a nobleman's seat of venerable interest; that sports and games formed the chief interest of the pupils, lessons being relegated to an appropriate secondary position; while, astonishing to relate, the honours in all University examinations fell to \"Hurst girls,\" and every woman who had made a name for herself had graduated from its ranks!  She detailed these interesting items of information with sublime assurance; and, when Harold mildly pointed out inconsistencies, retorted scornfully that she supposed she might be allowed to know, since Ella's cousin had _said_ so, and she had been there, and seen for herself!  Mrs Chester supported her by murmurs of assent, and little warning frowns to her son, which in dumb language signified that he was to be a good boy, and not aggravate his sister; and Mr Chester put his arm round her waist, and looked down at her, half smiling, half pitiful.  The pitiful expression grew, and became so marked that the girl gazed at him in surprise.  Why did he look so sorry?  Was he already feeling the blank which her absence would leave?  Did he fear that she would be home-sick, and regret her hasty decision?  She stared into his face with her bright blue eyes, and her father gazed back, noting the firm chin, the arched brows, the characteristic tilt of the head.  This overweening confidence of youth--he was asking himself earnestly--was it altogether a misfortune, or but raw material out of which great things were to be made in the future?  Was it not better to go forth to meet life's battle with a light heart and fearless tread than trembling and full of doubt? Surely it was better, and yet his heart was sore for the girl, as the heart of a leader must be sore when he sends his soldiers to the front, knowing that no victory is won without a cost, no fight without a scar. Something very like a tear glittered in the father's eye, and at the sight Rhoda's face softened into a charming tenderness.  She snuggled her head into his neck, and rubbed her soft cheeks against his, murmuring absurd little sentences of endearment, as to a child of two years old.  \"Whose pet is it, then?  Whose own precious?  The nicest old sweet in the world.\"  Mr Chester pushed the girl aside, and put on a frown of portentous ferocity to conceal the delight with which her demonstration had, in reality, filled him.  He loved to feel the sweep of the crisp locks, the touch of the soft cheek; he even appreciated, if the truth must be told, being addressed as a \"precious,\" but wild horses would not have induced him to confess as much, and he made haste to leave the room with Harold lest perchance any sign of his real feelings might betray themselves to the sharp feminine eye.  Left alone with her mother, Rhoda clasped her hands behind her back, and paced slowly up and down.  It was a relief, after all, to be rid of the men, and be able to talk things over with a feminine hearer who never brought forward inconvenient quibbles, who accepted statements as facts, as of course they were, and agreed to propositions in a quiet, reasonable manner.  Rhoda thought out several important matters in that march to and fro, and announced the result in a decisive manner.  \"I must have a complete new outfit!  I don't believe in taking half-worn things.  You can send them away to that poor clergyman in Ireland, with the five daughters.  Geraldine, isn't it, who `fits' my clothes?  Well, Geraldine shall have my blue silk, and the fawn jacket, and the blouses, and the grey dress.  If the arm-holes stick into her as much as they do into me, she will wish I had never been invented.  She can have my best hat, too, if she wants it.  I hate it, and at `Hurst' you never wear anything but sailors', with the school colours.  There is a blue house, and a pink, and a green, and a yellow, and a red; that's the way they arrange in all big schools, and I only hope and pray it won't be my fate to be yellow, or _what_ an image I'll look!  Other things being equal, Mum dear, kindly say you think the blue house would be best for my health and morals.  I want to live _in_, you understand, not _out_-- that's one point I have quite decided.\"  \"In what, dearest?  Out of what?  I don't understand what you mean.\"  \"In school itself.  There are three houses in the school building and three in the grounds, and, of course, if you live `out' you have ten minutes' walk over to classes, whatever the weather may be.  I should object to shivering across the first thing in the morning in rain and snow and getting all splashed and blown.  No one can call me a coddle, but I _do_ like comfort, and it would be a dreadful fag--\"  \"I should think so, indeed; most risky!  I wouldn't hear of it for you. If you go at all you must live in, and have a comfortable room, with a fire in cold weather.\"  \"Oh, well; I don't know if you can expect that.  We mustn't be too exacting.  You will look after my clothes at once, mother, won't you? for there will be so much to get.  I want things nice, you know!  I should like the girls to see that I had decent belongings.  I love having all the _little_ things complete and dainty.  I think girls ought to be particular about them.  It's a sign of refinement.  I can't endure shabby things round me.\"  \"Of course not, darling; and there's no reason why you should.  Write down a list of what you want, so that we shan't forget anything when we are in town.  You shall have all you need; but, oh! dear me, I don't know how shall I live when you have gone.  I shall break my heart without you!\"  And Mrs Chester's tears once more rolled down her cheeks.  It seemed to her at this moment that the greatest trouble which her happy life had known was this projected parting from her beloved daughter.    CHAPTER THREE.  ANTICIPATIONS.  Two days later Mr and Mrs Chester started on their tour of inspection, and Rhoda reflected that she could not employ herself better during their absence than by preparing, so far as might be, for the life ahead. She went upstairs to her own sitting-room, and made a sweeping survey of her treasures.  The books in the hanging cases must, of course, be left behind, since they were too numerous to carry.  She looked lovingly at their bright gold and leather backs, and took down a special favourite here and there, to dip into its contents.  The Waverley novels ran in a long, yellow line across one shelf; Dickens, clad in red, came immediately beneath; and a whole row of poets on the bottom shelf. Wordsworth was a prize from Fraulein, but his pages were still stiff and unread; Longfellow opened of himself at \"Hiawatha\"; while Tennyson, most beloved of all, held half a dozen markers at favourite passages.  His portrait hung close at hand, a copy of that wonderful portrait by Watts, which seems to have immortalised all the power and beauty of the strange, sad face.  Rhoda nicked a grain of dust from the glass surface, and carefully straightened the frame against the wall, for this picture was one of her greatest treasures, and respected"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],["title","Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#3)"],["body","ordingly.  Another case held books of stories, ranging from the fairy tales of childhood to the publications of last year; a third was devoted to bound volumes of magazines, and a fourth to the less showy and interesting school-books.  \"It's no use taking _you_!\" said Rhoda scornfully.  \"I expect you are quite out of date.  You can stay here and rest, and when I come back I'll point out your errors, and send you into the lumber-room to make room for the new ones!\"  Then she turned her attention to the mantelpiece, on which reposed a quite extraordinary number of miniature jugs.  Jugs, jugs everywhere, and nothing but jugs; blue jugs, yellow jugs, brown jugs, red jugs; Worcester jugs with delicate white figures against a background of blue; jugs worth a penny sterling at the village emporium; plain jugs, iridescent jugs; jugs with one handle, with two, with three, with none at all.  Their variety was as puzzling as their number, but Rhoda gazed at them with all the pride of the collector. \"Jugs\"--unrivalled by postcards, stamps, or crests--had been her mania for a year on end, and the result was dear to her heart.  To find a new jug to add to the collection had appeared one of the chief objects in travelling; an expedition to town had been a failure or success, according as it discovered jugs or no jugs.  In her anxiety for their safety she had even volunteered to dust her own mantelpiece, and now, alas! she must leave them to the tender mercies of Mary and her assistants!  It was a painful reflection, and after a moment's consideration she determined not to risk it, but to store the darlings away in some safe hiding-place until her return.  No sooner said than done.  Each little jug was wrapped in a separate roll of tissue paper, fitted into a drawer of the writing-table, and securely locked against invasion.  The process of \"putting away\" thus begun extended itself indefinitely.  The photographs in their various frames must be arranged and divided; nice relations and very dearest friends, to be taken to school, disagreeable or \"middling\" relations, and merely \"dearest friends,\" to be laid aside in another drawer; fragile ornaments to be hidden, in case they were broken; silver and brass in case they tarnished; letters to be destroyed, to be tied up in packets, to be answered before leaving home; pieces of fancy work to be folded away, in case sacrilegious hands should dare to put them to any other use than that for which they were intended.  Rhoda set to work with the energy of ten women, and worked away until the once tidy room had become a scene of wildest confusion; until sofa, table, and chairs were alike piled high with bundles.  Then of a sudden her energy flagged, she grew tired and discouraged, and wished she had left the stupid old things where she had found them.  It occurred to her as a brilliant inspiration that there was no possible hurry, and that sitting under the trees reading a book, and drinking lemon squash, was a much more agreeable method of spending a hot summer's day than working like a charwoman.  She carried her latest book into the garden forthwith, ordered the \"squash,\" and spent an hour of contented idleness before lunch.  The story, however, was not interesting enough to tempt a second reading during the afternoon, for the heroine was a girl of unimpeachable character, who pursued her studies at home under the charge of a daily governess, and such a poor-spirited creature could hardly be expected to commend herself to a girl who had decided for two whole days to go to the newest of all new schools, and already felt herself far removed from such narrow experiences.  Rhoda cast about in her mind for the next diversion, and decided to bicycle across the park to call upon the Vicar's daughter the self-same Ella Mason who had been her informant on so many important points.  Ella would be indeed overcome to hear that Rhoda herself was to be a \"Hurst\" girl, and there would be an increased interest in hearing afresh those odd pieces of information which had fallen from the cousin's lips.  She felt a thrill of relief on hearing that her friend was at home, and in finding her alone in the morning-room, which looked so bare and colourless to eyes accustomed to the splendours of the Chase.  Something of the same contrast existed between the two girls themselves, for while Rhoda sat glowing pink and white after her ride, Ella's cheeks were as pale as her dress, and her eyes almost as colourless as the washed-out ribbon round her waist.  She was not a beauty by any means, but unaffectedly loving and unselfish, rejoicing in her friend's news, though it would deprive her of a favourite companion, and she was all anxiety to help and encourage.  She knitted her brow to remember all that the cousin had said of Hurst Manor, wishing only that she had listened with more attention to those pearls of wisdom.  \"Yes, she said that they did a great deal of Latin.  All the girls learn it, and it seems to be looked on as one of the most important subjects. They translate Horace and Livy and all kinds of learned books.\"  \"Humph!  I shan't!\" declared Rhoda coolly.  \"I don't approve of Latin for girls.  It's silly.  Of course, if you intend to teach, or be a doctor, or anything like that, it may be useful, but for ordinary stop- at-home girls it's nonsense.  What use would Latin be to _me_, I should like to know?  I shall take modern languages instead.  I can read and write French fluently, though it doesn't come quite so easy to speak it, and German, of course, is second nature after jabbering with Fraulein all these years.  I should _think_ in German if I would allow myself, but I won't.  I don't think it is patriotic.  There is not very much that any one can teach me of French or German!\"  \"Then what is the use of studying them any more?\" inquired Ella, aptly enough; but Rhoda was not a whit discomposed.  \"My dear, it is ever so much pleasanter doing things that you understand!  The first stages are such a grind.  Well, what next?  What other subjects are important?\"  \"Mathematics.  Some of the girls are awfully clever, and are ever so far on in Euclid.  I did one book with father; but it worried me so, and I cried so much one day when he altered the letters and put the whole thing out, that he grew tired, and said I could give it up.  You didn't do any with Fraulein, I think?\"  \"No; it's a nuisance.  I wish I did now; but I'll have to begin at once, that's all!  I'll get Harold's old books and cram up before I go, so that I can just bring in an expression now and then, as if I knew all about it.  Girls are so patronising if they think you are a beginner... I'm pretty well up in history, and can say reams of poetry, and play, and draw, and paint in water colours--\"  \"Ye-es!\" assented Ella feebly.  She was afraid to say so much in words, but her conviction was that her friend's methods of work would seem strangely antiquated when contrasted with the vivid strength of the new _regime_.  She recalled Rhoda's mild copies of village scenes, with cottages in the foreground, trees to the rear, and a well-regulated flight of swallows on the sky line, and mentally placed them beside her cousin's vigorous sketches on the Slade system, where two or three lines seemed to do the work of a dozen, and prettiness was a thing abhorred! She remembered the lessons in theory and harmony, and trembled for her friend's awakening.  \"Yes,\" she repeated.  \"Oh, of course; and then there are other things besides lessons--a girl can make herself popular by being pleasant and obliging, and the outdoor life is so fascinating. Games every day, just as if you were boys, and each one trying to get into a higher team, and as keen and enthusiastic as she can be.  You _will_ enjoy the games, Rhoda!\"  \"Now that's just one thing I wanted to talk to you about!\" cried Rhoda earnestly.  \"I'm glad you reminded me.  Of course, tennis and croquet are all right.  I can play a _very_ good set, and beat most ladies at croquet.  One time this summer I made five hoops in one turn, and took my partner with me, but of course I don't do that _every_ day of the week.  I'm all right for summer games, but winter is coming on, and I shall have to play that horrid old hockey, and I haven't the remotest idea how it is done.  I've never seen a match, but you have, and I want you to tell me all about it, so that I may know what to do, and not make an idiot of myself.  You went to the Betham ground when you were staying there, and saw the girls' team play.  Go on!  Describe it!  Tell me all about it, and everything they did!\"  Ella drew a deep breath, and looked awed and important.  \"Well! it was a county match, and one team wore white blouses and the other pink.  They had on blue skirts, very short, and awful feet!  Some had great pads on each ankle, and some had leggings, and some had nothing at all.  I should have swathings of cotton wool a foot wide, for it made my ankles ache just to see the sticks swinging about!  It was an icy day; the wind went through us like knives and scissors, and we stood on little planks of wood and shuddered, with furs up to our ears, but they wore no hats or jackets, and their sleeves went flap, flap, as thin as possible.  There was only one pretty one among them, all the rest looked--hideous!  There was a goal at one end, _here_, and another, _here_.\"  Ella drew a rough map of the ground on the back of an envelope, and Rhoda looked on with breathless interest.  \"This team wanted to make a goal _here_, and the other side tried to prevent them. They whacked with their sticks, and off went the ball, and each side flew after it, trying to send it the way they wanted, and one poor, wretched girl stood before each goal to prevent the enemy's ball from entering.  I expected they would both die of consumption the next day, but I met them out at tea, quite spry and lively, and they said they didn't feel cold a bit.  I didn't believe them, but "]]]
