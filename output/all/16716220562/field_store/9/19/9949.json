His dark head and back could be distinguished amid the surging foam, as he made his way through the breakers for some distance, when a huge wave rolling in beat him back almost to the beach.  The lieutenant hauled in the rope, fearing that Tom's legs might be entangled, but the brave black again sprang forward. He had, however, another danger besides the sea to encounter.  Already broken spars, planks, and masses of timber, with bales of all sorts, were being hurled on shore, and a blow from some heavy piece of wreck might in an instant disable him.  It seemed useless indeed to proceed further; not a human being was likely to have remained alive on the shattered wreck.  Probably the larger number were drowned when the boat was upset.  Another sea, still fiercer than the former, rushing on with a loud roar, again drove Tom back.  \"We must haul in the rope,\" cried the lieutenant.  \"I cannot let the brave fellow further risk his life.\"  But once more it was found that Tom was dragging out the rope.  \"I heard a cry, and I fancy I see some one not far from.  Tom,\" exclaimed Edward.  \"Yes, yes! he is making towards the man.  Ah, I fear he has missed him; no, he has hold of him.  Haul away, uncle, haul away; let me go and help him, there's rope enough to spare,\" and Ned, securing the slack end of the rope under his arms and seizing the spare oar, dashed forward in time to grasp the man just as the black, exhausted by his exertions, was on the point of letting him go.  Another wave breaking at the moment, and hissing as it rushed back in a sheet of foam over the beach, would have swept away the almost rescued man, but Edward, planting his oar deep in the sand, held on while the lieutenant was engaged in hauling Tom out of danger, hastening, the moment he had done so, to assist his nephew in landing the stranger.  The latter still breathed, and attempted to raise himself from the sand, though unable to speak.  \"You attend to him, Ned, while I look after Tom,\" said the lieutenant.  The black, however, required no assistance.  He proposed, indeed, to again swim off on the chance of finding some other human being struggling for life; but this the lieutenant would not allow.  Already the breakers were covered with masses of wreck, amid which not a single person could be seen, though they looked out eagerly, Tom pressing into the seething foam as far as he dared venture, while the lieutenant held up the lantern as a signal to any strong swimmer who might successfully have buffeted with the waves; but he did so with little hope of success. Every now and then he looked round, uttering an exclamation of regret at the non-appearance of the coast-guard, though, had they arrived, it was evident that they would be too late to be of use.  The sea continued to cast up fragments of wreck and cargo on the beach, but the lieutenant and Tom searched in vain for any of their fellow-creatures to whom they might render assistance.  \"No use waiting longer, I fear,\" shouted the lieutenant.  \"I'll go and look after the man we have saved; the sooner we get him under shelter the better, or he'll be perishing of cold.\"  \"Me stop just a little longer,\" answered the black.  \"Take care though that the sea doesn't carry you off, Tom,\" cried the lieutenant, even now trusting that someone else might be rescued.  On returning to the spot where Edward was tending the stranger, he bent down by the side of the latter and felt his heart.  \"He is still evidently in a very exhausted condition,\" he observed, holding up his lantern so that the light fell on the man's countenance.  \"Poor fellow, he does not look as if he were accustomed to a seaman's life.\"  \"I have been rubbing his hands and chest, uncle, and trying what I could do to revive him,\" said Edward.  \"We should get him home at once, I am sure.\"  \"Just what I was saying; we must not risk his life on the chance of saving that of others,\" replied the lieutenant.  \"Come, Tom,\" he shouted, \"it is of no use, we must carry home this poor fellow; and may be before we get far the coast-guard will be down here and take our places.\"  At that instant a hail was heard.  The lieutenant shouted in return.  In a few minutes a party of coast-guard men appeared, headed by their lieutenant, who had heard the guns, and had been searching for the spot where the vessel had struck.  The man to whom Edward had given the message had, however, not appeared, having, as was afterwards discovered, fallen over the cliff and nearly lost his life.  Lieutenant Hanson said that he would remain on the spot, though his rockets would be useless, as not a man could be clinging to the wreck.  \"Let me have one of your people to assist in carrying this poor fellow to my cottage then,\" said Lieutenant Pack; \"it is more than Tom and I can accomplish, seeing that my timber toe is apt to stick in the soft sand as I trudge along.\"  \"With all my heart,\" was the answer.  \"You shall have two, only send them back without delay.\"  No further time was lost.  The coast-guard men, wrapping the stranger in their dry coats, lifted him on their shoulders, Ned and Tom taking his feet, while the lieutenant led the way, lantern in hand, towards his home.  Although a bright light beaming forth from the sitting-room of the lieutenant's abode could alone be distinguished as the party approached, it may be as well to describe it at once.  Triton Cottage, as he called it, from the name of the ship on board which he first went to sea, stood on the side of a broad gap or opening in the cliff, some little distance up from the beach, the ground around it being sufficiently level to allow of a fair-sized garden and shrubbery.  It was a building of somewhat curious appearance, having no pretentions to what is considered architectural beauty.  The lieutenant, notwithstanding, was proud of it, as the larger portion had been erected by his own hands from time to time as he considered it necessary to increase its size, in order to afford sufficient accommodation to its inmates, and to obtain a spare room in which he could put up an old shipmate, or any other visitor to whom his hospitable feelings might prompt him to give an invitation. The original building had been a fisherman's cottage, to which he had added another story, with a broad verandah in front, while on either side wings had been attached, the upper portions composed of wood obtained from wrecks, the bulkheads serving as wainscoting to the rooms. Both from their size and the fittings they resembled the cabins of a small vessel, being warmed also by ship's stoves, with high flues, curiously topped, rising above the roof, exhibiting a variety of contrivances to prevent the smoke from beating down.  The tar-bucket and paint-pot had been brought largely into requisition, the wood-work of the lower story being covered with a shining coat of black, while various colours adorned the walls both inside and out.  The old lieutenant might frequently have been seen, brush in hand, adorning his mansion, and stopping up every crevice, so as to defy damp, or rain driven against it by the fiercest of south-westerly gales.  It was substantially roofed with thick slabs of slate, obtained from a neighbouring quarry, calculated to withstand the storms of winter or the thickest downfall of snow.  The building had, however, so slight an appearance that it looked as if it might be carried by a strong wind into the sea; but a closer inspection showed that the materials of which it was composed were well seasoned and firmly put together, and though gaily bedecked, fire was the only element it had to fear, and against that the owner had taken all necessary precautions.  \"Sally, sister Sally!\" he shouted, as he neared the door, \"I have brought a guest who requires careful looking after, or he'll slip through our fingers, for he's pretty well gone already.\"  As he spoke, the door opened, and a female appeared holding a shaded lamp in her hand, which the wind threatened every instant to extinguish. Her figure was short and slight, her dress a grey silk gown, a plain lace cap confining her once dark hair, already sprinkled with grey, drawn back from her forehead, on which not a wrinkle could be seen.  A kind expression beamed from her countenance, which, if it had never possessed much beauty, must always have been pleasant to look upon.  \"Thank Heaven you've come back at last, John!  Tom frightened me by the intelligence that a wreck was on shore, and I knew that you would be exposing yourself to danger.  Have many of the poor fellows been saved?\"  \"Only one, I fear,\" answered the lieutenant, pointing to the men who now approached.  \"Take him into my room, Tom; the sooner he is in bed the better, and mine is ready for him.  Get some warm broth or a cup of tea made in the meantime.  He is terribly exhausted, and probably has not tasted food for many hours.\"  The lieutenant made these remarks as Ned and Tom, with the coast-guard men, conveyed the stranger into the room, when, speedily taking off his wet garments, they placed him in bed.  \"By his dress I suspect he is a gentleman,\" observed the lieutenant to his nephew, as Tom gathered up his wet clothes.  \"Hand me his watch and purse--it is a heavy one--and that pocket-book.  Here is a small case too, something of value probably.  He will be glad to know that his property is safe when he comes to.  Run and see if the tea is ready.  I will get him, if I can, to take a little hot liquid.  Tell your aunt and Jane to stir up the fire and get the broth boiling; that will soon set him on his legs I hope.\"  The lieutenant now managed to pour the warm tea down the throat of the stranger, who opened his eyes, and looking about with an astonished gaze murmured, \"Thank you, thank you!  Where am I?\"  \"All right and safe on shore, though you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21472"],["title","Ned Garth; Or, Made Prisoner in Africa: A Tale of the Slave Trade (#2)"],["body","take my room to be a ship's cabin,\" answered the lieutenant.  \"We have got your property, in case you are anxious about it; and after you have had a basin of broth I would advise you to try and go to sleep.  It will restore your strength faster than any food we can give you.\"  The stranger again murmured his thanks, and soon after the broth was brought, following his host's advice, he fell into a quiet slumber.  \"He'll require a visit from the doctor perhaps, though I hope that he'll do well enough now,\" observed the lieutenant, as he sat at supper with his sister and Ned that evening after he had paid all the attention necessary to his guest.  \"I wonder who he can be?\" observed Miss Sarah.  \"You say he was dressed as a gentleman, and has a considerable amount of property in his possession.\"  \"Your female curiosity will probably be gratified to-morrow, when he is able to give an account of himself,\" replied the lieutenant; \"but it matters very little as far as we are concerned.  I suspect he'll thank us for doing what it was our simple duty to do, and after he has gone his way we shall probably hear no more of him.  Had he been a seaman, without a copper in his pocket, we should have treated him in the same fashion I hope.  Remember, Ned, the meaning of having no respect for persons.  It is not that we are not to respect those above us, but that we are to treat our fellow-creatures alike, without expectation of reward, and to pull a drowning man, whether a lord or an ordinary seaman, out of the water when we can.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  The next morning Ned went off to summon the doctor from the neighbouring town, for their guest still remained in an apparently dangerous state. Several days passed before he was able to rise.  He was evidently, from his conversation and manners, a man of education; but he did not speak of himself, except to mention that his name was Farrance, and that he was on a voyage from the Mediterranean in the \"Champion\" brig, when she had been cast away; and he again also expressed his gratitude to Miss Sarah Pack for the kindness he was receiving, and to the lieutenant and his companions for preserving his life.  He made minute inquiries as to the occurrence, he only remembering that he was clinging to a portion of the wreck after she had struck, when he felt himself washed into the foaming breakers.  He appeared to be interested in Ned, whom he drew into conversation, inquiring particularly what profession he intended to follow.  \"I wish to enter the navy, as my father and uncle did,\" answered Ned; \"but my uncle says that he has no interest, and that I should have little chance of promotion.  Indeed, his means are so limited that I cannot ask him to provide the necessary funds, so I conclude I shall have to go into the merchant service.\"  \"Well, well, you are right in desiring not to be an expense to your uncle.  Every man should endeavour, as far as he can, to depend upon his own exertions; however, you have still some time to think about the matter, and you will, I hope, succeed in whatever profession you follow,\" remarked the stranger.  There was another inmate of the house who appeared to interest him even more than Edward.  A little girl of some ten or twelve years of age--a fair-haired, blue-eyed damsel, with a sweet, gentle expression of countenance, yet full of life and spirits.  Edward had told him that she was not his sister, although he loved her as much as if she were.  The first evening he came into the sitting-room the lieutenant heard him ask her name.  \"I am called Mary,\" she answered; \"Uncle John gave me my name when he first found me.\"  She shortly afterwards left the room.  The stranger watched her as she went out with a look of much surprise.  \"You may be curious to know the meaning of her remark,\" observed Miss Sarah.  \"My brother will tell you how she came into our possession; very thankful I have been to have so sprightly and sweet a young creature under our roof, though at first I confess I felt somewhat anxious when he placed her in my charge.\"  Mr Farrance turned an inquiring glance towards his host.  \"I have but a short yarn to spin about the matter,\" said the lieutenant. \"Some few years ago, after I had quitted the service, an old friend offered me the command of a ship bound on a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope and up the Red Sea.  I was not sorry to obtain employment, and was glad to have the opportunity of making a few pounds, which might assist to keep the pot boiling at home, and help Sally in her housekeeping.  Having touched at the Cape, I was steering for Aden, when we were overtaken by a heavy gale, which pretty severely tried my stout ship.  We were about to make sail in the morning, the wind having abated and the sea gone down, when an object was seen floating a short distance ahead.  On getting nearer, we saw that it was a piece of wreck with a man upon it.  Standing on, I hove the ship to, and having lowered a boat, watched with interest her approach to the raft.  The man was, I made out, a black.  He was holding what looked like a bundle of clothes with one hand, keeping it above the water, which still nearly washed over him.  His bundle contained, I had no doubt, something of value, or he would not have exerted himself as he was doing to preserve it from the sea.  It was of value, and, to my mind, the most valuable thing in creation--a young child, as I discovered when the boat returned with the rescued man, who still held fast to his treasure.  We lifted them both carefully on board.  The black sank exhausted on the deck, making signs to us, however, to take care of the child.  We thought that it was his own, but when we got a look at its countenance, greatly to our surprise we found that it was as fair as any European.  How the man had managed to preserve it during the heavy sea which had been running for some hours seemed a miracle.  We carried them both into my cabin.  The little girl, you may be sure, had plenty of nurses.  She looked frightened enough at seeing us, but appeared wonderfully little the worse for the exposure to which she had been subjected; indeed, although the shawl which had wrapped her was wet, the water was warm and the black must have contrived to keep her head well out of the sea, as her face and hair were only moistened by the spray.  \"Though she seemed almost too young to speak, she uttered several words in a lingo none of us understood.  In a very short time after we had given her some food, and she had had a quiet sleep, she seemed more happy and smiled, and lifted up her face to kiss me when I bent over her.  I thanked Heaven that I had been the means of saving the little darling.  \"It was not until evening that the black, who was pretty well exhausted by his exertions, awoke.  I was disappointed, I can tell you, when on speaking to him, he answered in a language of which I could not comprehend a word.  We tried him in all sorts of ways, and he made a variety of signs, but we could not comprehend the meaning he intended to convey.  In appearance he greatly resembled the slaves I had seen at Zanzibar, on board the Arab dhows, though better-looking.  Like most of them, he had but a clout round his waist, and his woolly hair was cropped close.  Still he evidently did not lack intelligence.  It was very tantalising to find that we could get no information out of him. The little girl was equally unable to give an account of herself, though I fancied that she understood us when we spoke English, but she could not reply intelligibly.  \"I treated the black as he deserved, for the brave way in which he had saved the child, and he showed that he was grateful for such kindness as I bestowed upon him.  \"As to the little girl, though I made inquiries at every place I touched at, I could get no information by which I could even guess where she had come from or who she was.  From her ways and tone of voice I felt sure, however, that she was of gentle birth.  The black seemed mortally afraid of the Arabs, and kept below when any came on board or any dhows hove in sight; indeed it was some time before we could make him understand that he was safe with us, and that no one would venture to take him away by force.  He soon became a great favourite with the men, who gave him the name of Tom, in addition to the one by which he called himself, which sounded like Baraka, and Tom Baraka he has been ever since.  In a short time he picked up a few words of English, with which he managed to make himself understood; but it was not until we were on the voyage home that he was able to give me an idea how he and the little girl came to be on the piece of wreck from which we rescued him.  I would call him in, and let him give his own history; but I think I can make you understand the account better if I give it in ordinary English, for I took no little trouble during several months to get the truth out of him, anxious as he was to give the information I required.  His vocabulary being somewhat limited, he accompanied his words by signs, often of so curious a description that it was with difficulty my officers and I could restrain ourselves from bursting into fits of laughter, and yet his account was sad enough.  \"I placed before him the best map I possessed of the part of Africa from which I calculated he came, and explained to him the rivers and lakes marked upon it.  He shook his head, as if he could make nothing of it, but at last fixed on a spot some way in the interior.  \"`There!' he said, making a wide circle with his finger, `There abouts was my home.  By the banks of a river which fell into a lake my people and I were happy in our way, we cultivated our fields and tended our cattle, and had abundance of food without thinking of the future.  We heard, it is true, that the cruel men who come across from the big sea had carried off not a few of the inhabitants of other districts; but it was a long, long distance away, and we hoped they"]]]
