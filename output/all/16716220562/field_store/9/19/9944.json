And, to signify that       peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius which inthralls every       reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional verse, from the       “Haunted Palace”:     And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,    Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling ever more,    A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,    In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.        Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful       circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary       career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere       subsistence, his memory malignantly misrepresented by his       earliest biographer, Griswold, how completely has truth at last       routed falsehood and how magnificently has Poe come into his own.       For “The Raven,” first published in 1845, and, within a few       months, read, recited and parodied wherever the English language       was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less than a year       later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching appeal       to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his       dying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very       straitened circumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:        “Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men       of genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary       profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,       from bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the       common objects of public charity. There is no intermediate       stopping-place, no respectful shelter, where, with the delicacy       due to genius and culture, he might secure aid, till, with       returning health, he would resume his labors, and his unmortified       sense of independence.”        And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the       master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of       witchery and mystery as “The Fall of the House of Usher” and       “Ligeia”; such fascinating hoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure       of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a Bottle,” “A Descent Into a       Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales of conscience as       “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale Heart,”       wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful       fidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay”       and “The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in       ratiocination as the “Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,”       “The Purloined Letter” and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the       latter, a recital of fact, demonstrating the author’s wonderful       capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human       mind; such tales of illusion and banter as “The Premature Burial”       and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether”; such bits of       extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The Angel of the       Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon       Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the       enthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made       him many enemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so       mercilessly exposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as       “The Bells,” “The Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the       Sea” and “The Raven.” What delight for the jaded senses of the       reader is this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an       atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What resources of       imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One might       almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to a       half faith in the old superstition of the significance of       anagrams, found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name,       the words “a God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted       Palace,” echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons.        “No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to       record, the wonders of his inner life.”        In these twentieth century days—of lavish recognition—artistic,       popular and material—of genius, what rewards might not a Poe       claim!        Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American       revolutionary patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs.       Hopkins, an English actress, and, the match meeting with parental       disapproval, had himself taken to the stage as a profession.       Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty and talent the young couple had       a sorry struggle for existence. When Edgar, at the age of two       years, was orphaned, the family was in the utmost destitution.       Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless       and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine       were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted by       John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and       sister, the remaining children, were cared for by others.        In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money       could provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers.       In Mrs. Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could       bestow. Mr. Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious       lad. At the age of five the boy recited, with fine effect,       passages of English poetry to the visitors at the Allan house.        From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor       House school, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the       Rev. Dr. Bransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly       portrayed in “William Wilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820       Edgar was sent to the school of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He       proved an apt pupil. Years afterward Professor Clarke thus wrote:        “While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote       genuine poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was       ambitious to excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without       haughtiness. He had a sensitive and tender heart and would do       anything for a friend. His nature was entirely free from       selfishness.”        At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at       Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session.       Official records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary,       he gained a creditable record as a student, although it is       admitted that he contracted debts and had “an ungovernable       passion for card-playing.” These debts may have led to his       quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually compelled him to make his       own way in the world.        Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced       Calvin Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small       volume of his verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.”       In 1829 we find Poe in Baltimore with another manuscript volume       of verses, which was soon published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf,       Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither of these ventures seems to       have attracted much attention.        Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe,       through the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United       States Military Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have       attached to cadet life in Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for       discipline at West Point was never so severe nor were the       accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was more and more toward       literature. Life at the academy daily became increasingly       distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and       to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal       from the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7,       1831, Poe found himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had       thrown the lad on his own resources. His literary career was to       begin.        Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the       successful competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore       periodical for the best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle”       was the winning tale. Poe had submitted six stories in a volume.       “Our only difficulty,” says Mr. Latrobe, one of the judges, “was       in selecting from the rich contents of the volume.”        During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected       with various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia       and New York. He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough.       N. P. Willis, who for some time employed Poe as critic and       sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,” wrote thus:        “With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness       to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led       by common report to expect a very capricious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2147"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 1 (#1)"],["body","to his       duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time       went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious.       We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet, patient,       industrious and most gentlemanly person.        “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became       uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible, his will was palpably insane. In this reversed       character, we repeat, it was never our chance to meet him.”        On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in       Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was       but twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular       contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither.        Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for       its victim, and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted. Virginia died January 30, 1847, when but       twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family pictures the       death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.        These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last       year of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       child-wife:       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In a kingdom by the sea;      But we loved with a love that was more than love—     I and my Annabel Lee;      With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea.      A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;      So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,      To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.        Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s       Magazine” and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the       “Evening Mirror,” the “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s       Book” in New York. Everywhere Poe’s life was one of unremitting       toil. No tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit.        Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       best-known tales, was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was       but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when his literary reputation was       established securely, he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.        Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe       never lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent       talents win admirers. His genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from William Winter’s poem, read at the       dedication exercises of the Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885,       in New York:       He was the voice of beauty and of woe,      Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;      Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,      Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,      Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,      Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,      Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers,      fluttering from on high,      And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.        In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s       death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe       as man and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill,       Eugene Didier, Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and Poe is seen as he actually was—not as a man       without failings, it is true, but as the finest and most original       genius in American letters. As the years go on his fame       increases. His works have been translated into many foreign       languages. His is a household name in France and England—in fact,       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own       country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it       ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.  W. H. R.     EDGAR ALLAN POE   By James Russell Lowell        The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no       centre, or, if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes.       It is divided into many systems, each revolving round its several       suns, and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milk-and-water way. Our capital city, unlike London or Paris,       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities, but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one       of her own, of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the Atlantic.        Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved, and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish, that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an alms, we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The critic’s ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it.        Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The       offspring of a romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early       age, he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose       barren marriage-bed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet.        Having received a classical education in England, he returned       home and entered the University of Virginia, where, after an       extravagant course, followed by reformation at the last       extremity, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.       Then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was       rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the       military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father,       by a second marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not       mentioned, soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard,       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support.       Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small       volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and       excited high expectations of its author’s future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges.        That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first       poems, though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness,       give but a very faint promise of the directness, condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works. Perhaps, however,       Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and Adonis”       having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.       Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and       a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have       all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow       namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that       the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where       he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with       no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional       piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober       raiment of prose. They do not clutch"]]]
