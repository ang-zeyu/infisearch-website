General Conway renewed his motion on the war on the 27th, and achieved a complete triumph, his minority of 1 being converted in five days into a majority of 19. But Lord North still clung to office, and it was not till the 6th of March, when he was beaten by a majority of 16 on the subject of the taxes, that he began to betray symptoms of a retreat. On the 8th the motion on the war was renewed, when Ministers, collecting the whole force of placemen and contractors, obtained a majority of 10, which was reduced afterwards to 9 on a vote of confidence. The crisis had now arrived. The Earl of Surrey had given notice in the Lords of a motion to the effect that Ministers no longer possessed the confidence of the country, when Lord North entered the House, and informed their Lordships that His Majesty had come to a determination to make an entire change of Administration.  This was on the 19th of March. But so far back as the 11th His Majesty had been in negotiation with the Marquis of Rockingham, through the agency of Lord Chancellor Thurlow, who detained his Lordship in the House for an hour and a half after it had adjourned to converse with him, by His Majesty's desire, upon the practicability of forming an Administration \"on a broad bottom.\" The negotiation with Thurlow spread over an entire week, and entirely failed on the plan proposed by His Majesty, who wished to limit Lord Rockingham in the first instance to the nomination of a Cabinet whose policy should lie over for future consideration. \"I must confess,\" observes Lord Rockingham, in one of his letters to the Lord Chancellor, \"that I do not think it an advisable measure, first to attempt to form a Ministry by arrangement of office--afterwards to decide upon what principles or measures they are to act.\"  The day this letter was written Lord North resigned; and in two days afterwards His Majesty renewed the negotiation with Lord Rockingham, finally agreeing to the whole of his propositions, and reserving only the household in his own hands. While these negotiations were in progress, Lord Temple wrote to Lord Rockingham, expressing his earnest hope that the \"cards should be dealt only into those hands where he so much wished them, from every motive of public and private regard.\" Before the end of the month the cards _were_ dealt into the hands in which Lord Temple wished to see them, and the new Ministry was completed, with Lord Rockingham as First Lord of the Treasury; Lord Shelburne and Mr. Fox as Secretaries of State; Lord John Cavendish, Chancellor of the Exchequer; Admiral Keppel, at the head of the Admiralty; General Conway (much to the King's dissatisfaction), at the Horse Guards; with the additional strength of the Dukes of Richmond and Grafton, and Lords Camden and Ashburton, Burke, Sheridan, and Colonel Barr√©, in other offices; Thurlow (the only Tory in the Cabinet) still continuing as Lord Chancellor.  One of the earliest measures of the new Government was to negotiate a peace with America; and Mr. Thomas Grenville was appointed upon a mission for that purpose to Paris, to meet Dr. Franklin. The history of that mission is contained in a series of deeply interesting letters, which, independently of the flood of light they throw upon the American business, possess a permanent value as illustrations of the personal characters of the writers (especially those of Sheridan, to whose rashness Mr. Grenville makes express allusion), and as showing that, even in office, the Whigs were not united amongst themselves. The materials of which the Cabinet was formed, being composed of the Rockingham, and the Chatham, or Shelburne Whigs--two sections of that party which had never cordially coalesced--was not calculated to work together; but it could not have been anticipated that their personal jealousies would have taken a shape so dangerous as these letters disclose.  It is clear, from the singular facts revealed in this Correspondence, that, while an ostensible Minister was dispatched to Paris by the general action of the Government, with the sanction of the King, to negotiate terms with the American Minister, Lord Shelburne had taken upon himself to appoint another negotiator, who was not only not to act in concert with Mr. Grenville, but whose clandestine mission seems to have been expressly intended to thwart and embarrass him, and whose appointment was without the approval, or even the knowledge, of the Cabinet. How far the King may have secretly supported Lord Shelburne in this breach of faith with his colleagues, we are left to conjecture; but the intriguing character ascribed to His Majesty by Lord Shelburne himself, justifies, to some extent, the suspicion that a proceeding so bold and so full of hazard to the Whig Administration, was not adopted upon the sole responsibility of the Minister. Lord Shelburne said of the King, that he \"possessed one art beyond any man he had ever known; for that by the familiarity of his intercourse he obtained your confidence, procured from you your opinion of different public characters, and then availed himself of this knowledge to sow dissensions.\" (Nicholl's Recollections and Reflections during the reign of George III.) This opinion, just or unjust (and there is no great reason to doubt its justice), was founded upon extensive personal experiences, of which this sinister attempt to break up the union of the Cabinet may have been one.       MR. SHERIDAN TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.      St. James's, May 21st, 1782.      Dear Grenville,      You are certainly one of the best negotiators that ever     negotiated; and so says the King, your royal master, who is     going to send you the fine silver box which you receive with     this, and which, with great envy, I learn is your property; and     which, if the serious modesty of your former despatch could have     been seriously construed, you would not have been entitled to.     Though I have not written before, have not my punctuality and     remembrance appeared conspicuous in the newspapers you receive?     These tell you all the private news, and all that is important     of public you will have heard before you receive this; so this     must be a very short letter, and indeed the messenger is almost     going; and Charles has been writing to you, which is another     reason for my saying very little. Mr. Oswald talks very     sanguinely about Franklin, and says he is more open to you than     he has been to any one; but he is a Scotsman, and belonging to     Lord Shelburne. If the business of an American treaty seemed     likely to prosper in your hands, I should not think it     improbable that Lord Shelburne would try to thwart it. Oswald     had not yet seen Lord Shelburne; and by his cajoling manner to     _our secretary_ and eagerness to come to him, I do not feel much     prejudiced in his favour; but probably I judge wrongly whenever     the other secretary is concerned, for I grow suspicious of him     in every respect, the more I see of every transaction of his.      I am just told that the messenger is ready, so more in my next.     There is no particular news. The Dutch are got back to the     Texel. Lord Howe still off there, but nothing likely to come of     it. Sir G. Rodney, notwithstanding his victory, is to be     recalled, and Pigott is sailed. This I think very magnanimous in     the Ministers or very impolitic; events must justify, but it is     putting themselves too much in their power.      We had a good illumination for this news. You see how we go on     in Parliament by the papers; we were bullied outrageously about     our poor Parliamentary Reform; but it will do at last, in spite     of you all.      Yours ever sincerely,      R.B. Sheridan.       MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE      Dear Grenville,      If your letter of the 10th a little damped me in my hopes of     good effects from your journey, that of the 19th, which I have     just received, together with Mr. Oswald's conversation, has very     much revived me. I send away the messenger, for fear of the     delays which Cabinets are so apt to cause; but I hope you will     hear from us again very soon, with authority to offer the     Independence as unconditionally as you can wish. Mr. Oswald says     that Dr. Franklin is much inclined to confide in you; if so, ask     him at once in what manner we can act so as to gain a     substantial, if not a nominal, peace with America; and you may     depend upon all my influence in support of his advice.      I hope you will not be disappointed at our adhering to our first     ideas for the proposition _we_ are to make, rather than offering     concessions. If _we_ are to offer, we think it is not for us to     throw concessions at their head; but if they do not like our     proposals, it is for _them_ to ask such as may be reasonable. If     what they propose is really so, there is no doubt of our     complying; and if it is not, or they should refuse to make any     offer at all, it will surely be clear who was most in earnest in     his wishes for peace; and we must make the best advantage we can     of our situation, about which I begin to be more sanguine than I     used to do.      From your letter, there are surely great hopes of detaching     America; and from those we have just received from Petersburg,     there appears the most favourable disposition in that quarter to     enforce a peace with Holland; or if that cannot be, to take a     decisive part. And I know how much this disposition will be     increased, if we can fully convince His Imperial Majesty that     the failure of your negotiation is not our "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20982"],["title","Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of George the Third (#5)"],["body","fault.      With regard to all your diffidence of yourself, we laugh at it.     If, in order to save yourself bodily labour, you want a     secretary, write, and you shall have one; but for any other     purpose, you want no assistance, but are allowed by everybody,     and the King in particular, to be the best writer of despatches     that is known in this office.      Adieu. I envy you the pleasure of announcing the news from the     West Indies, with all the modest insolence which belongs to the     occasion.      Yours most affectionately,      Pray make my best respects to Dr. Franklin, whose letter to me     contained some very promising expressions. Assure him that, in     spite of all that has happened, he and I are still of the same     country.      St. James's, Tuesday night,      May 21st, 1782.       MR. SHERIDAN TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.      St. James's, May 26th, 1782.      My dear Grenville,      Charles not being well, I write to you at his desire, that you     may not be surprized at having no private letter from him with     the despatch which Mr. Oswald brings you. There is not room, I     believe, for much communication of any very private nature on     the subject of your instructions and situation, as his public     letter, you will see, is very sincerely to the purpose. If     anything in it admits of modification, or is not to be very     literally taken, I should conceive it to be the recommendation     of explicitness with Oswald; on which subject I own I have     suggested doubts; and Charles wishes you to have a caution for     your own discretion to make use of.      I perceive uniformly (from our intercepted information) that all     these _city_ negotiators--Mr. Wentworths, Bourdeaux,     &c.--insinuate themselves into these sort of affairs merely for     private advantages, and make their trust principally subservient     to stock-jobbing views, on which subject there appears to be a     surprising communication with Paris. Mr. Oswald's officiousness     in bringing over your despatch and other things I have been told     since by those who know him, lead me to form this kind of     opinion of him; but you will judge where this will apply to any     confidence that should be placed in him.      Surely, whatever the preliminaries of a treaty for peace with     France may be, it would be our interest, if we could, to drop     even mentioning the Americans in them; at least the seeming to     grant anything to them as at the requisition of France. France     now denies our ceding Independence to America to be anything     given to them, and declines to allow anything for it. In my     opinion it would be wiser in them to insist ostentatiously (and     even to make a point of allowing something for it) on the     Independence of America being as the first article of their     treating; and this would for ever furnish them with a claim on     the friendship and confidence of the Americans after the peace.     But since they do not do this, surely it would not be bad     policy, even if we gave up more to France in other respects, to     prevent her appearing in the treaty as in any respect the     champion of America, or as having made any claims for her; we     giving her up everything she wants equally, and her future     confidence and alliance being such an object to us. Were I the     Minister, I would give France an island or two to choose, if it     would expose her selfishness, sooner than let her gain the     _esteem of the Americans_ by claiming anything essential for     them in apparent preference to her own interest and ambition.     All people, of all descriptions, in America, will read the     treaty of peace, whenever it comes, which France shall make with     this country; and if they should see there that she has claimed     and got a good deal for herself, but has not appeared to have     thought of them, however they may have profited in fact, it     would certainly give us a great advantage in those sort of     arguments and competitions which will arise after a peace;     whereas if it appears as a stipulated demand on the part of     France that America should be independent, it will for ever be a     most handy record and argument for the French party in that     country to work with; and this, as things stand now, and as far     as my poor judgment goes, appears not to be a very difficult     thing to have either way. And so these are my politics on that     subject for you.      You will find Rodney has taken some more ships. The unluckiness     of his recal, I think, appears to increase in its ill effect;     and people don't seem to fancy Pigott. Rolle has given notice     that he will move on Thursday to know who advised His Majesty to     recal Rodney; and out of doors the talk is the same. Charles     gave Johnson, who had been very violent on this subject the     other day, an excellent trimming; but there was a good deal of     coy with the other.      The arming plan don't seem to take at all. We have not yet heard     from Ireland since Burgoyne took them over a constitution.[1]      There is nothing odd or new to tell you, but that here is a most     untimely strange sort of an influenza which every creature     catches. You must not mind the badness of my scrawl: and let me     hear from you. Does Lafayette join your consultation dinners     with Franklin, as some of our Roupell intelligence sets forth? I     take it for granted the French Ministers will think it a point     of spirit to seem rather less desirous of peace since your     defeat in the West?      Howe is still off the Texel, and the Dutch safe within.      What mere politics I write to you! One might as well be a     newspaper editor at once, I believe, as anything that politics     can make one: but all other pursuits are as idle and     unsatisfactory, and that's a comfort.      Yours ever,      R. B. Sheridan.   [Footnote 1: The Duke of Rutland had been appointed by the new Ministry Lord-Lieutenant in Ireland and General Burgoyne Commander-in-Chief there.]       MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.      Dear Grenville,      I have only time to write a line to tell you that I have     received your letter by Gregson, and also that by the post     containing the letters that passed between M. de Vergennes and     you. I do not choose to tell you anything more of my opinion by     this conveyance, than that all you have done is perfectly and     exactly right, and that His Majesty is of the same opinion.      Rolle moved yesterday, and Rosewarne seconded, a sort of censure     on the recal of Rodney, and Lord North made such a figure as     made even his enemies pity him; he showed such a desire to     support the motion, without daring to do it, as was perfectly     ridiculous. Adieu!      Yours, ever affectionately,      C. J. F.      We are all surprised at your not knowing the great news on the     24th, which was the date of your letter by Gregson.      Every account from Ireland is pleasant to the greatest degree.      St. James's, May 31st, 1782       MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.      Paris, June 4th, 1782.      Dear Charles,      The _public_ letter which I send to you by Lauzun, is, as you     will see, of no other use than that of accounting for his     journey, and enabling him to carry to you this _private_ one, of     which I had once almost determined to be myself the bearer; an     apprehension, however, that so sudden an arrival might be     embarrassing to you, has decided me not to take that step, till     I had explained to you my reasons for wishing to do so, though I     should not care to write them, except in the full confidence     that they will be seen by no person whatever but yourself.     Recollect always that this letter is written in that confidence,     and I am sure I never can repent of having sent it.      You will easily see, from the tenor of the correspondence we     have hitherto had, that what little use I could be of to you     here, appeared to me to be in the communication that I had with     Franklin; I considered the rest of the negotiation as dependent     upon that, and the only possible immediate advantages which were     to be expected, seemed to me to rest in the jealousy which the     French Court would entertain of not being thoroughly supported     in everything by America. The degree of confidence which     Franklin seemed inclined to place in me, and which he expressed     to me more than once in the strongest terms, very much favoured     this idea, and encouraged me in wishing to learn from him what     might be in future ground for a partial connection between     England and America; I say in future, because I have hitherto     never much believed in any treaty of the year 1782; and my     expectation, even from the strongest of Franklin's expressions,     was not of an immediate turn in our favour, or any positive     advantage from the Commissioners in Europe, till the people in     America should cry out to them, from seeing that England was     meeting their wishes. It was in this light, too, that I saw room     to hope for some good effects from a voluntary offer of     unconditional independence to America, a chance which looked the     more tempting as I own I considered the sacrifice as but a small     one, and such as, had I been an American, I had thought myself     little obliged to Great Britain in this moment for granting,     except from an idea that if it was an article of treaty, it     would have been as much given by France as by England. I repeat     this only to remind you that, from these considerations, the     whole of my attention has been given to Franklin, and that I     should have considered myself as losing my time here, if it had     not been directed to that subject.      I believe I told you in my last, that I had very sanguine     expectations of Franklin's being inclined to speak out"]]]
