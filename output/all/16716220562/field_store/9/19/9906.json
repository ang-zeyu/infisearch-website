I still think, as I did then, that McPherson's punishment was the more appropriate.  Livingston was one of those charming, amiable fellows with whom nobody could well find any fault, though I believe he did get a good many demerits.  He also seemed to need the aid of tobacco in his studies.  William P. Craighill, who succeeded McPherson as first captain, had no fault whatever, that I ever heard of, except one--that was, standing too high for his age.  He was a beardless youth, only five feet high and sixteen years old when he entered the academy; yet he was so inconsiderate as to keep ahead of me all the time in everything but tactics, and that was of no consequence to him, for he was not destined to command troops in the field, while, as it turned out, I was.  It has always seemed to me a little strange that the one branch which I never expected to use afterward was the only study in which I graduated at the head.  Perhaps McPherson and Craighill thought, as I did, that it made no difference where I stood in tactics.  Among all the tactical officers of our time, Lieutenant John M. Jones was esteemed the most accomplished soldier and tactician, and the most rigid but just and impartial disciplinarian.  It had been my good fortune to enjoy his instruction while I was private, corporal, sergeant, and lieutenant, and I fully shared with others in the above high estimate of his character.  I even flattered myself that my soldierly conduct in all that time had not escaped his favorable notice.  When my case was before the court of inquiry in the summer of 1852, the professors who had been called to testify gave me a high character as a faithful, diligent student.  When Lieutenant Jones was called to testify as to my character as a soldier, he replied that, in his opinion, it was very bad!  While I was not a little surprised and disappointed at that revelation of the truth from the lips of the superior whom I so highly respected, and did not doubt for a moment his better judgment, I could not be unmindful of the fact that the other tactical officers did not know me so well and had not so high a reputation as Lieutenant Jones in respect to discipline; and I felt at liberty to avail myself, in my own interest, of the opportunity suggested by this reflection. Hence, when, after my complete restoration to the academy in January, I found my demerits accumulating with alarming rapidity, I applied for and obtained a transfer to Company C, where I would be under Lieutenant Cogswell and Cadet Captain Vincent, my beloved classmate, who had cordially invited me to share his room in barracks.                                                                ROBERT E. LEE  John B. Hood was a jolly good fellow, a little discouraged at first by unexpected hard work; but he fought his way manfully to the end. He was not quite so talented as some of his great associates in the Confederate army, but he was a tremendous fighter when occasion offered.  During that last period of our cadet life, Colonel Robert E. Lee was superintendent of the academy; he was the personification of dignity, justice, and kindness, and he was respected and admired as the ideal of a commanding officer.  Colonel Robert S. Garnett was commandant of cadets; he was a thorough soldier who meted out impartial justice with both hands.  At our last parade I received \"honorable mention\" twice, both the personal judgment of the commandant himself.  The one was for standing at the head of the class in tactics; the other, for \"not carrying musket properly in ranks.\"  Who can ever forget that last parade, when the entire class, officers and privates together, marched up in line and made their salute to the gallant commandant!  To a West-Pointer no other emotion equals it, except that of victory in battle.

Hill's Home in Virginia --Assigned to Duty in the Department of Philosophy at West Point-- Interest in Astronomy--Marriage--A Hint from Jefferson Davis--Leave of Absence--Professor of Physics in Washington University.  An old army colonel many years ago described a West Point graduate, when he first reported for duty after graduating leave, as a very young officer with a full supply of self-esteem, a four-story leather trunk filled with good clothes, and an empty pocket.  To that must be added, in my case, a debt equal to the full value of trunk and clothes and a hundred dollars borrowed money.  My \"equipment fund\" and much more had been expended in Washington and in journeys to and fro during the period of administrative uncertainty in respect to the demands of discipline at West Point.  Still I had so good a time, that graduating leave, as any millionaire in the United States.  My good father was evidently disturbed, and began to fear--for the first time, I think--that I was really going to the bad!  His worst fears as to the possible effects of a military education had, after all, been realized!  When I showed him the first check from New York, covering my pay account for July, he said that it was enough to ruin any boy in the world.  Indeed, I myself was conscious of the fact that I had not done a stroke of work all that month for those sixty-five and a half dollars; and in order that my father might be convinced of my determination not to let such unearned wealth lead me into dissipation, I at once offered to lend him fifty dollars to pay a debt due to somebody on the Freeport Baptist meeting-house.  Confidence was thereby restored.                                                     BREVET SECOND LIEUTENANT  My first orders assigned me to duty at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, as brevet second lieutenant in the 2d Artillery.  The steamer landed me at Charleston, September 29, 1853, the day I became twenty-two years of age.  The next morning I found myself without money enough to pay my hotel bill and take me over to Sullivan's Island, but pay was due me for September.  Upon inquiry, I found that the paymaster was not in the city, but that he kept his public funds in the Bank of South Carolina.  Being unacquainted with any of the good people of Charleston, the well-known rules of banks about identification seemed a serious obstacle.  I presented my pay account at the bank, informing the cashier with a confident air that I was well aware of the fact that the major's money was there, but that the major himself was out of town.  The accomplished cashier, after scrutinizing me for a time, handed me the money. My older brother officers at the fort had a good laugh at what they were pleased to call my \"brass\"; but I consoled myself with the reflection that I had found out that my face was good for something. It is an instructive fact that before the Civil War an officer of the army needed no indorser anywhere in this country.  His check or his pay account was as good as gold.  All that was required was identification.  It is lamentably true that such has not been the case since the war.  I found only one officer on duty with my battery at Fort Moultrie, and he was awaiting my arrival so that he might go on leave.  He turned over the command with a manifestation of confidence which surprised me at the time, but which was fully explained the next day.  In the morning the first sergeant reported to me, with the quarterly and monthly returns prepared for my signature, and made out more beautifully than anything in writing I had ever before seen, and explained to me in detail all the business affairs of the battery, as if he were reporting to an old captain who had just returned from a long leave of absence.  Next to General Scott and Colonel Lee, with whom I had the honor of some acquaintance, I was quite sure there stood before me the finest-looking and most accomplished soldier in the United States Army.  What a hard time young officers of the army would sometimes have but for the old sergeants!  I have pitied from the bottom of my heart volunteer officers whom I have seen starting out, even in the midst of war, with perfectly raw regiments, and not even one old sergeant to teach them anything.  No country ought to be so cruel to its soldiers as that.  In September we had the usual artillery target practice, which was afterward recalled to my mind many times by the bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1861 by the same guns I had used in practice, and at the same range.  Then came the change of stations of troops, which took the Moultrie garrison to Florida, and some of the 1st Artillery to their place.  For a time the fort was left without garrison except a few officers who were awaiting the arrival of their regiment. I also was ordered to remain until I \"got off my brevet\" and was appointed \"full second\" in the 1st Artillery.  It had been a yellow- fever summer, and the cottages on Sullivan's Island were even more fully occupied than usual, mostly by families of planters from the rice plantations of South Carolina.  Hospitality was unbounded, and of the most charming character.  Nothing I have experienced at home or in the great capitals of Europe has surpassed or dimmed the memory of that first introduction to Southern society.                                              JOURNEY TO FORT CAPRON, FLORIDA  In December, 1853, the order came announcing my appointment as second lieutenant, 1st Artillery, and directing me to join Battery D at Fort Capron, Indian River, Florida.  A steamer took me to Palatka, stopping a short time at Jacksonville, which was then little more than a landing on the St. John's River.  After a week's delay at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21417"],["title","Forty-Six Years in the Army (#5)"],["body","atka, another little mail-steamer carried me and few other passengers up the river to lake Monroe, whence a mule served for transportation across to New Smyrna, on Mosquito Lagoon, opposite the inlet.  It was a great day's sport going up the river.  The banks seemed almost lined with alligators, and the water covered with water-fowl of all kinds, while an occasional deer or flock of turkeys near by would offer a chance shot.  At New Smyrna Mrs. Sheldon provided excellent entertainment during the ten days' waiting for the mail-boat down Mosquito Lagoon and Indian River, while Mr. Sheldon's pack of hounds furnished sport.  At length old Captain Davis took the mail and my baggage and me on board his sloop, bound for Fort Capron, opposite the mouth of Indian River. He divided his time fairly between carrying the United States mail and drinking whisky, but he never attempted to do both at the same time.  I am not sure but it was the captain's example which first suggested to me the rule which I adopted when commanding an army in the field--to do no drinking till after the day's fighting was over.  But, in fact, I never liked whisky, and never drank much, anyhow.  We arrived in twenty-five days from Charleston, which was regarded as a very satisfactory journey.  At the fort I found Captain and Brevet-Major Joseph A. Haskin, commanding; First Lieutenant A. P. Hill, afterward lieutenant-general in the Confederate army; Dr. A. J. Foard, assistant surgeon; and my classmate Livingston, brevet second lieutenant; besides sixteen enlisted men--rather a close approximation to the ideal of that old colonel who once said the army would be delightful if it were not for the ---- soldiers. But that was changed after a while by the arrival of recruits-- enough in one batch to fill the battery full.  The battery had recently come from the gulf coast, where yellow fever had done destructive work.  I was told that there happened to be only one officer on duty with the battery--a Lieutenant somebody--when the fever broke out, and that he resigned and went home.  If that is true, I trust he went into the Civil War and got killed in battle; for that was the only atonement he could possibly make for leaving his men in that way.  But such cases have been exceedingly rare, while those of the opposite extreme have not been uncommon, where officers have remained with the sick and died there, instead of going with the main body of their men to a more healthy place. The proper place for a line officer is with the fighting force, to care for it and preserve its strength by every means in his power, for war may come to-morrow.  The surgeons and their assistants must and do fully care for the sick and wounded.  Life at Fort Capron was not by any means monotonous.  It was varied by sailing, fishing, and shooting, and even the continuity of sport was broken twice a month, generally, by the arrival of the mail- boat.  But at length this diversion failed us.  Some difference occurred between the United States Post-office Department and the mail-contractor on the St. John's River, and we got no mail for three months.  Then the commanding officer ordered me to go to Charleston by the sloop that had brought us supplies, and bring back the mail by the regular route.  I made the round trip in little more than a month.  That same paymaster whom I had found away from his post on my first arrival in Charleston intrusted to me a carpet- bag full of gold and silver, to pay off the garrison for the past six months, with as much advance pay as the officers would consent to take, so that he would not have to make the trip down for a long time to come.  I had to carry the money-bag and a revolver about with me for twenty-five days or more.  I have never consented to handle Uncle Sam's money since that time.                                                         AN \"AFFAIR OF HONOR\"  It was during that short visit to Charleston that I became engaged, for the first and only time, in an \"affair of honor.\"  A young man who had been in my class at West Point, but had resigned before the class had graduated, came to me at the hotel, and asked me, as his \"friend,\" to deliver a note he held in his hand.  I replied: \"Yes.  If you will place yourself in my hands and do what I decide is honorable and right, I will be your friend.  Tell me about it.\" My condition was accepted without reserve.  My friend, whose home was in a distant city, had been in Charleston some weeks, and had spent all the money he had and all he could borrow.  He was on the eve of negotiating a further loan from a well-known banker when the son of that banker, who had met my friend about town, told his father the plain truth about my friend's habits and his probable value as a debtor.  The negotiation was ended.  My friend had become a stranger in a strange land, without the means to stay there any longer or to go home.  It was a desperate case--one which could not be relived by anything less than the blood of the young \"villain\" who had told his father that \"infamous\"--truth!  I replied:  \"Yes, that is a bad case; we will have to fix that up.  How are you off at home?\"  He said the \"old man\" had plenty of money, but had sent him enough to come home once or twice before, and would not send any more.  Upon further inquiry, I found that my friend's hotel bill and expenses home would amount to a little less than the sum I had just drawn on my pay account up to date; so I handed him the money, saying that he could return it when convenient, and his \"honor\" was fully satisfied.  I never afterward heard anything from him about that money, and my tailor had to wait a little longer for his pay; but I had done my duty, as I understood it, under the code of honor.  I saw that friend once afterward.  He went into the army in 1861, accidentally shot himself, and died miserably on the march, an old musket-barrel, placed there by my order, marking his grave by the wayside.  It was not granted to him, poor fellow! to fight a battle for his country.  I took with me to Florida some law-books--Blackstone, Kent, and a few others: so few, indeed, that I learned them nearly all by heart; then, for want of anything better, I read over the entire code of the State of Florida.  Several times in after years I found it necessary, in order to save time, to repeat to great lawyers the exact words of the Constitution of the United States; but their habit was much the better.  It is seldom wise to burden the memory with those things which you have only to open a book to find out. I recollect well that answer once made by William M. Evarts, then attorney-general of the United States, to my inquiry whether he would give me, offhand, the law on a certain point, to save the time requisite for a formal application and answer in writing.  He said if it was a question of statute law he would have to examine the books, but if only a question of common law he could make that as well as anybody.  But I had nothing better to do for a time in Florida, and when I got out I did not find my memory half so much overloaded with law as my blood was with malarial poison.  Luckily, I got rid of the poison after a while, but held on to the law, and I never found it did me any harm.  In fact, I would advise all young officers to acquire as much of it as they can.                                          AN EXTEMPORZIED \"MAP AND ITINERARY\"  In the winter of 1853-4 there was an armed truce between the United States of America and the Seminole nation.  A new policy was soon inaugurated, which had for its object to establish a complete line of posts across the State from Jupiter to Lake Okeechobee, and thence westward to the gulf, so as more securely to confine the Seminoles within the Everglade region, although, so far as I know, nobody then wanted the use of that more northern part of this vast territory.  The first step was to reopen the old military road from the mouth of Indian River across to the Kissimmee River, and thence to Tampa.  Being the second lieutenant of the single company, I was given the privilege of doing that work, and nine men and one wagon were assigned me for that purpose.  I spent the larger part of my time, going and coming, in hunting on either the right or left of the road, thereby obtaining all the deer and turkeys the command could consume, but paying very little attention to the road itself, in utter disregard of the usual military rule which requires that a sketch be made and an itinerary kept of all such marches. Hence I was a little puzzled when Acting-Inspector-General Canby, from Washington, wanted to go across from Indian River to Tampa, and called on me for a copy of my map and itinerary.  But I had stood very high in drawing at West Point, and could not allow myself to be disturbed in any such way as that; so I unlocked what little recollection I had of the route and my general knowledge of the country, and prepared a very beautiful map and a quite elaborate itinerary, with which the inspector-general seemed greatly pleased. But I took great care, in addition, to send a man with him who had been with me, and who was a good guide, so I felt quite safe respecting any possible imperfections that the inspector-general might find in my work.  I never heard anything more about that matter until General Sherman and I met General Canby at Portland in 1870.  At that time we had a little laugh at my expense respecting the beauty of that map of mine, and the accuracy with which I had delineated the route.  But as I was then a major-general, and Canby was a brigadier-general under my command, I was not subjected to the just criticism I deserved for having forgotten that map and itinerary at the time I made the march.
