Raffles--Raffles--don't you know who she was?\"  It was my hand that gripped his arm once more.  \"I guessed,\" he answered, gravely enough even for me.  \"It was she who saved me, not you,\" I said.  \"And that is the bitterest part of all!\"  Yet I told him that part with a strange sad pride in her whom I had lost--through him--forever.  As I ended we turned into High Street; in the prevailing stillness, the faint strains of the band reached us from the Empress Rooms; and I hailed a crawling hansom as Raffles turned that way.  \"Bunny,\" said he, \"it's no use saying I'm sorry.  Sorrow adds insult in a case like this--if ever there was or will be such another! Only believe me, Bunny, when I swear to you that I had not the smallest shadow of a suspicion that she was in the house.\"  And in my heart of hearts I did believe him; but I could not bring myself to say the words.  \"You told me yourself that you had written to her in the country,\" he pursued.  \"And that letter!\" I rejoined, in a fresh wave of bitterness: \"that letter she had written at dead of night, and stolen down to post, it was the one I have been waiting for all these days!  I should have got it to-morrow.  Now I shall never get it, never hear from her again, nor have another chance in this world or in the next. I don't say it was all your fault.  You no more knew that she was there than I did.  But you told me a deliberate lie about her people, and that I never shall forgive.\"  I spoke as vehemently as I could under my breath.  The hansom was waiting at the curb.  \"I can say no more than I have said,\" returned Raffles with a shrug. \"Lie or no lie, I didn't tell it to bring you with me, but to get you to give me certain information without feeling a beast about it. But, as a matter of fact, it was no lie about old Hector Carruthers and Lord Lochmaben, and anybody but you would have guessed the truth.\"  \"What is the truth?\"  \"I as good as told you, Bunny, again and again.\"  \"Then tell me now.\"  \"If you read your paper there would be no need; but if you want to know, old Carruthers headed the list of the Birthday Honors, and Lord Lochmaben is the title of his choice.\"  And this miserable quibble was not a lie!  My lip curled, I turned my back without a word, and drove home to my Mount Street flat in a new fury of savage scorn.  Not a lie, indeed!  It was the one that is half a truth, the meanest lie of all, and the very last to which I could have dreamt that Raffles would stoop.  So far there had been a degree of honor between us, if only of the kind understood to obtain between thief and thief.  Now all that was at an end. Raffles had cheated me. Raffles had completed the ruin of my life. I was done with Raffles, as she who shall not be named was done with me.  And yet, even while I blamed him most bitterly, and utterly abominated his deceitful deed, I could not but admit in my heart that the result was put of all proportion to the intent: he had never dreamt of doing me this injury, or indeed any injury at all. Intrinsically the deceit had been quite venial, the reason for it obviously the reason that Raffles had given me.  It was quite true that he had spoken of this Lochmaben peerage as a new creation, and of the heir to it in a fashion only applicable to Alick Carruthers.  He had given me hints, which I had been too dense to take, and he had certainly made more than one attempt to deter me from accompanying him on this fatal emprise; had he been more explicit, I might have made it my business to deter him.  I could not say in my heart that Raffles had failed to satisfy such honor as I might reasonably expect to subsist between us.  Yet it seems to me to require a superhuman sanity always and unerringly to separate cause from effect, achievement from intent.  And I, for one, was never quite able to do so in this case.  I could not be accused of neglecting my newspaper during the next few wretched days.  I read every word that I could find about the attempted jewel-robbery in Palace Gardens, and the reports afforded me my sole comfort.  In the first place, it was only an attempted robbery; nothing had been taken, after all.  And then--and then--the one member of the household who had come nearest to a personal encounter with either of us was unable to furnish any description of the man--had even expressed a doubt as to the likelihood of identification in the event of an arrest!  I will not say with what mingled feelings I read and dwelt on that announcement. It kept a certain faint glow alive within me until the morning brought me back the only presents I had ever made her.  They were books; jewellery had been tabooed by the authorities.  And the books came back without a word, though the parcel was directed in her hand.  I had made up my mind not to go near Raffles again, but in my heart I already regretted my resolve.  I had forfeited love, I had sacrificed honor, and now I must deliberately alienate myself from the one being whose society might yet be some recompense for all that I had lost. The situation was aggravated by the state of my exchequer.  I expected an ultimatum from my banker by every post. Yet this influence was nothing to the other.  It was Raffles I loved. It was not the dark life we led together, still less its base rewards; it was the man himself, his gayety, his humor, his dazzling audacity, his incomparable courage and resource.  And a very horror of turning to him again in mere need of greed set the seal on my first angry resolution.  But the anger was soon gone out of me, and when at length Raffles bridged the gap by coming to me, I rose to greet him almost with a shout.  He came as though nothing had happened; and, indeed, not very many days had passed, though they might have been months to me.  Yet I fancied the gaze that watched me through our smoke a trifle less sunny than it had been before.  And it was a relief to me when he came with few preliminaries to the inevitable point.  \"Did you ever hear from her, Bunny?\" he asked.  \"In a way,\" I answered.  \"We won't talk about it, if you don't mind, Raffles.\"  \"That sort of way!\" he exclaimed.  He seemed both surprised and disappointed.  \"Yes,\" I said, \"that sort of way.  It's finished.  What did you expect?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Raffles.  \"I only thought that the girl who went so far to get a fellow out of a tight place might go a little farther to keep him from getting into another.\"  \"I don't see why she should,\" said I, honestly enough, yet with the irritation of a less just feeling deep down in my inmost consciousness.  \"Yet you did hear from her?\" he persisted.  \"She sent me back my poor presents, without a word,\" I said, \"if you call that hearing.\"  I could not bring myself to own to Raffles that I had given her only books.  He asked if I was sure that she had sent them back herself; and that was his last question.  My answer was enough for him.  And to this day I cannot say whether it was more in relief than in regret that he laid a hand upon my shoulder.  \"So you are out of Paradise after all!\" said Raffles.  \"I was not sure, or I should have come round before.  Well, Bunny, if they don't want you there, there's a little Inferno in the Albany where you will be as welcome as ever.\"  And still, with all the magic mischief of his smile, there was that touch of sadness which I was yet to read aright.     The Chest of Silver  Like all the tribe of which I held him head, Raffles professed the liveliest disdain for unwieldy plunder of any description; it might be old Sheffield, or it might be solid silver or gold, but if the thing was not to be concealed about the person, he would none whatever of it. Unlike the rest of us, however, in this as in all else, Raffles would not infrequently allow the acquisitive spirit of the mere collector to silence the dictates of professional prudence.  The old oak chests, and even the mahogany wine-cooler, for which he had doubtless paid like an honest citizen, were thus immovable with pieces of crested plate, which he had neither the temerity to use nor the hardihood to melt or sell. He could but gloat over them behind locked doors, as I used to tell him, and at last one afternoon I caught him at it.  It was in the year after that of my novitiate, a halcyon period at the Albany, when Raffles left no crib uncracked, and I played second-murderer every time. I had called in response to a telegram in which he stated that he was going out of town, and must say good-by to me before he went. And I could only think that he was inspired by the same impulse toward the bronzed salvers and the tarnished teapots with which I found him surrounded, until my eyes lit upon the enormous silver-chest into which he was fitting them one by one.  \"Allow me, Bunny!  I shall take the liberty of locking both doors behind you and putting the key in my pocket,\" said Raffles, when he had let me in.  \"Not that I mean to take you prisoner, my dear fellow; but there are those of us who can turn keys from the outside, though it was never an accomplishment of mine.\"  \"Not Crawshay again?\" I cried, standing still in my hat.  Raffles regarded me with that tantalizing smile of his which might mean nothing, yet which often meant so much; and in a flash I was convinced that our most jealous enemy and dangerous rival, the doyen of an older school, had paid him yet another visit.  \"That remains to be seen,\" was the measured reply; \"and I for one have not set naked eye on the fellow since I saw him off through that window and left myself for dead on this very spot.  In fact, I imagined him comfortably back in jail.\"  \"Not old Crawshay!\" said I.  \"He's far too good a man to be taken twice.  I should call him the very prince of professional cracksmen.\"  \"Should you?\" said Raffles coldly, with as cold an eye looking into mine.  \"Then you had better prepare to repel princes when I'm gone.\"  \"But gone where?\" I asked,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2098"],["title","A Thief in the Night: A Book of Raffles' Adventures (#4)"],["body"," finding a corner for my hat and coat, and helping myself to the comforts of the venerable dresser which was one of our friend's greatest treasures.  \"Where is it you are off to, and why are you taking this herd of white elephants with you?\"  Raffles bestowed the cachet of his smile on my description of his motley plate.  He joined me in one of his favorite cigarettes, only shaking a superior head at his own decanter.  \"One question at a time, Bunny,\" said he.  \"In the first place, I am going to have these rooms freshened up with a potful of paint, the electric light, and the telephone you've been at me about so long.\"  \"Good!\" I cried.  \"Then we shall be able to talk to each other day and night!\"  \"And get overheard and run in for our pains?  I shall wait till you are run in, I think,\" said Raffles cruelly.  \"But the rest's a necessity: not that I love new paint or am pining for electric light, but for reasons which I will just breathe in your private ear, Bunny. You must not try to take them too seriously; but the fact is, there is just the least bit of a twitter against me in this rookery of an Albany.  It must have been started by that tame old bird, Policeman Mackenzie; it isn't very bad as yet, but it needn't be that to reach my ears.  Well, it was open to me either to clear out altogether, and so confirm whatever happened to be in the air, or to go off for a time, under some arrangement which would give the authorities ample excuse for overhauling every inch of my rooms.  Which would you have done, Bunny?\"  \"Cleared out, while I could!\" said I devoutly.  \"So I should have thought,\" rejoined Raffles.  \"Yet you see the merit of my plan.  I shall leave every mortal thing unlocked.\"  \"Except that,\" said I, kicking the huge oak case with the iron bands and clamps, and the baize lining fast disappearing under heavy packages bearing the shapes of urns and candelabra.  \"That,\" replied Raffles, \"is neither to go with me nor to remain here.\"  \"Then what do you propose to do with it?\"  \"You have your banking account, and your banker,\" he went on.  This was perfectly true, though it was Raffles alone who had kept the one open, and enabled me to propitiate the other in moments of emergency.  \"Well?\"  \"Well, pay in this bundle of notes this afternoon, and say you have had a great week at Liverpool and Lincoln; then ask them if they can do with your silver while you run over to Paris for a merry Easter.  I should tell them it's rather heavy--a lot of old family stuff that you've a good mind to leave with them till you marry and settle down.\"  I winced at this, but consented to the rest after a moment's consideration.  After all, and for more reasons that I need enumerate, it was a plausible tale enough.  And Raffles had no banker; it was quite impossible for him to explain, across any single counter, the large sums of hard cash which did sometimes fall into his hands; and it might well be that he had nursed my small account in view of the very quandary which had now arisen.  On all grounds, it was impossible for me to refuse him, and I am still glad to remember that my assent was given, on the whole, ungrudgingly.  \"But when will the chest be ready for me,\" I merely asked, as I stuffed the notes into my cigarette case.  \"And how are we to get it out of this, in banking hours, without attracting any amount of attention at this end?\"  Raffles gave me an approving nod.  \"I'm glad to see you spot the crux so quickly, Bunny.  I have thought of your taking it round to your place first, under cloud of night; but we are bound to be seen even so, and on the whole it would look far less suspicious in broad daylight.  It will take you some twelve or fifteen minutes to drive to your bank in a growler, so if you are here with one at a quarter to ten to-morrow morning, that will exactly meet the case.  But you must have a hansom this minute if you mean to prepare the way with those notes this afternoon!\"  It was only too like the Raffles of those days to dismiss a subject and myself in the same breath, with a sudden nod, and a brief grasp of the hand he was already holding out for mine.  I had a great mind to take another of his cigarettes instead, for there were one or two points on which he had carefully omitted to enlighten me.  Thus, I had still to learn the bare direction of his journey; and it was all that I could do to drag it from him as I stood buttoning my coat and gloves.  \"Scotland,\" he vouchsafed at last.  \"At Easter,\" I remarked.  \"To learn the language,\" he explained.  \"I have no tongue but my own, you see, but I try to make up for it by cultivating every shade of that.  Some of them have come in useful even to your knowledge, Bunny: what price my Cockney that night in St.  John's Wood?  I can keep up my end in stage Irish, real Devonshire, very fair Norfolk, and three distinct Yorkshire dialects.  But my good Galloway Scots might be better, and I mean to make it so.\"  \"You still haven't told me where to write to you.\"  \"I'll write to you first, Bunny.\"  \"At least let me see you off,\" I urged at the door.  \"I promise not to look at your ticket if you tell me the train!\"  \"The eleven-fifty from Euston.\"  \"Then I'll be with you by quarter to ten.\"  And I left him without further parley, reading his impatience in his face.  Everything, to be sure, seemed clear enough without that fuller discussion which I loved and Raffles hated.  Yet I thought we might at least have dined together, and in my heart I felt just the least bit hurt, until it occurred to me as I drove to count the notes in my cigarette case.  Resentment was impossible after that. The sum ran well into three figures, and it was plain that Raffles meant me to have a good time in his absence.  So I told his lie with unction at my bank, and made due arrangements for the reception of his chest next morning. Then I repaired to our club, hoping he would drop in, and that we might dine together after all.  In that I was disappointed.  It was nothing, however, to the disappointment awaiting me at the Albany, when I arrived in my four-wheeler at the appointed hour next morning.  \"Mr. Raffles 'as gawn, sir,\" said the porter, with a note of reproach in his confidential undertone.  The man was a favorite with Raffles, who used him and tipped him with consummate tact, and he knew me only less well.  \"Gone!\" I echoed aghast.  \"Where on earth to?\"  \"Scotland, sir.\"  \"Already?\"  \"By the eleven-fifty lawst night.\"  \"Last night!  I thought he meant eleven-fifty this morning!\"  \"He knew you did, sir, when you never came, and he told me to tell you there was no such train.\"  I could have rent my garments in mortification and annoyance with myself and Raffles.  It was as much his fault as mine.  But for his indecent haste in getting rid of me, his characteristic abruptness at the end, there would have been no misunderstanding or mistake.  \"Any other message?\" I inquired morosely.  \"Only about the box, sir.  Mr. Raffles said as you was goin' to take chawge of it time he's away, and I've a friend ready to lend a 'and in getting it on the cab.  It's a rare 'eavy 'un, but Mr. Raffles an' me could lift it all right between us, so I dessay me an' my friend can.\"  For my own part, I must confess that its weight concerned me less than the vast size of that infernal chest, as I drove with it past club and park at ten o'clock in the morning.  Sit as far back as I might in the four-wheeler, I could conceal neither myself nor my connection with the huge iron-clamped case upon the roof: in my heated imagination its wood was glass through which all the world could see the guilty contents. Once an officious constable held up the traffic at our approach, and for a moment I put a blood-curdling construction upon the simple ceremony.  Low boys shouted after us--or if it was not after us, I thought it was--and that their cry was \"Stop thief!\"  Enough said of one of the most unpleasant cab-drives I ever had in my life.  Horresco referens.  At the bank, however, thanks to the foresight and liberality of Raffles, all was smooth water.  I paid my cabman handsomely, gave a florin to the stout fellow in livery whom he helped with the chest, and could have pressed gold upon the genial clerk who laughed like a gentleman at my jokes about the Liverpool winners and the latest betting on the Family Plate.  I was only disconcerted when he informed me that the bank gave no receipts for deposits of this nature.  I am now aware that few London banks do.  But it is pleasing to believe that at the time I looked--what I felt--as though all I valued upon earth were in jeopardy.  I should have got through the rest of that day happily enough, such was the load off my mind and hands, but for an extraordinary and most disconcerting note received late at night from Raffles himself. He was a man who telegraphed freely, but seldom wrote a letter. Sometimes, however, he sent a scribbled line by special messenger; and overnight, evidently in the train, he had scribbled this one to post in the small hours at Crewe:    \"'Ware Prince of Professors!  _He was in the offing when I left._   If slightest cause for uneasiness about bank, withdraw at once   and keep in own rooms like good chap,                                                      \"A. J. R.    \"P. S.--Other reasons, as you shall hear.\"   There was a nice nightcap for a puzzled head!  I had made rather an evening of it, what with increase of funds and decrease of anxiety, but this cryptic admonition spoiled the remainder of my night.  It had arrived by a late post, and I only wished that I had left it all night in my letter-box.   What exactly did it mean?  And what exactly must I do?  These were questions that confronted me with fresh force in the morning.  The news of Crawshay did not surprise me.  I was quite sure that Raffles had been given good reason to bear him in mind before his journey, even if he had not again beheld the ruffian in the flesh. That ruffian"]]]
