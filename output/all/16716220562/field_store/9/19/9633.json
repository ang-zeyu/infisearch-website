Well, the watch belonged to you, I suppose, and you aren't obliged to lend it to anybody.  What on earth do you want to go worrying about the thing any more for?\"  \"I'm not; only I wanted to be friends with Tom Drift.\"  \"What for?\" demanded Joe.  \"Oh, because--because I promised his mother I would be,\" pleaded Charlie.  \"All I can say is, you had no business to promise any one to be friends with a fellow you never saw.\"  \"But she said he was a nice fellow; and besides he made my watch go when it had stopped,\" added Charlie, as a great argument.  \"Why, Charlie, you are a greater little noodle than I took you for. Every one who calls that precious watch a good name is your master, and you're his slave.\"  \"Not so bad as that, Joe,\" said Charlie; \"but I say, isn't Tom Drift a nice boy, then?\"  \"Isn't he? that's all,\" replied the other.  \"I'm not going to abuse him behind his back, but take my advice, young un.  You are better off as Tom's enemy than his friend, and don't you try to make up to him any more.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Charlie in bewilderment.  \"Never you mind,\" was all Joe's reply; \"and now hand me down my Liddell and Scott and make yourself scarce.\"  Charlie, sorely puzzled, did as he was bid.  He certainly was not in love with Tom Drift; but it was not easy for him to give up, without an effort, his promise to be his friend.  Tom, however, was by no means in need of friends.  Not many weeks after the day when Charlie had left his study, disappointed and miserable, he might have been seen entertaining company of quite a different sort.  [My readers, let me here observe, must not be too curious to understand how it is I am able to speak of so many things which must have taken place beyond the range of my observation.  They will find the reason all in good time.]  The supper party over which Tom presided consisted of four boys, including himself.  One was Shadbolt, on whose account, it will be remembered, Tom had desired to borrow Charlie's watch.  Shadbolt was an unwholesome-looking fellow of fifteen, with coarse features and eyes that could not look you straight in the face if they had tried.  He was accompanied by his chum Margetson, who certainly had the advantage of his friend in looks, as well as in intellect.  The quartet was completed by Gus Burke, one of the smallest and most vicious boys at Randlebury. He was the son of a country squire, who had the unenviable reputation of being one of the hardest drinkers and fastest riders in his county; and the boy had already shown himself only too apt a pupil in the lessons in the midst of which his childhood had been passed.  He had at his tongue's tip all the slang of the stables and all the blackguardisms of the betting-ring; and boy--almost child--as he was, he affected the swagger and habits of a \"fast man,\" like a true son of his father.  At Randlebury he had wrought incredible mischief.  Tom Drift was not the only soft-minded vain boy whom he had infected by his pernicious example.  Like all reckless swaggerers, he had his band of admirers, who marked every action and drank in every word that fell from their hero's lips.  It was just with such boys as Drift that his influence was most telling; for Tom was a boy not without aptitude to note and emulate a powerful example, whether it were good or bad, while his vanity rendered him as pliant as wax to the hand of the flatterer.  Such was the party which assembled surreptitiously in Tom's study that evening and partook of the smuggled supper.  Tom had had hard work to provide for his guests, and had succeeded only at the risk of grave penalties if detected.  \"I say, Tom, old horse, this is a prime spread!\" said Gus; \"where did you get it?\"  \"Oh!\" said Tom, \"I had a new hat coming from Tiler's, so I got old Tripes (the butcher) to make a neat brown-paper parcel of the kidneys, and got them up in my gossamer.  The old donkey might have done the thing better though, for the juice squeezed through, and the inside of my hat looks as if I had lately been scalped.\"  \"Hard lines!  But never mind, perhaps they'll put it down to the crack you got on your forehead.\"  Tom flushed scarlet; any reference to his inglorious scuffle with Charlie Newcome was odious to him, as Gus and the others knew well enough.  He said nothing, however, only scowled angrily.  \"What!\" said Gus, \"does it hurt you still then?  Never mind, it was a good shot, and I wouldn't be ashamed of having floored you myself.\"  \"He didn't floor me; I fell!\" cried Tom indignantly.  \"Did you?  Rather a way fellows have when they get knocked down!\"  \"I was not knocked down, Gus, I tell you; and you'd better shut up!\"  \"All right, old horse! you mustn't mind a bit of chaff.  I'm sure you've taken it all very well.\"  \"Yes,\" said Margetson, \"everybody thinks you must take after your mother; you're such a sweet-tempered chap.\"  \"What do you know about my mother?\" snarled Tom.  \"Only what your young friend tells everybody about her.\"  \"What business has he to go talking all over the school about my affairs?\" exclaimed Tom furiously.  \"What's my mother to do with him?\"  \"A great deal, it seems,\" replied Margetson, \"for he promised her, on the strength of her assertion that you were a nice boy, to be your friend, and now he's awfully hurt you won't let him.\"  \"I thought it was Tom who was awfully hurt,\" put in Gus, by way of parenthesis.  \"I tell you what it is, you fellows,\" said Tom, \"it may be all very funny for you, but I've had quite enough of it.  Ever since that young canting humbug came here I've led the life of a dog.  If, instead of making a fool of me, you'd tell me how I can pay him out, I should be better pleased.\"  \"All very fine,\" said Margetson; \"why don't you pay your own bills?\"  \"If you want some one to punch his head,\" said Shadbolt the ugly, \"I don't mind trying; my life is insured.\"  \"Suppose we make him stupid,\" suggested Gus, \"with milk punch, and shove him inside the doctor's study.\"  \"Couldn't you get hold of his watch and boil it?\" said Margetson, who had heard of the experiments practised on me in Mrs Packer's parlour.  \"If I got hold of it I'd smash it into fifty pieces!\" growled Tom between his teeth.  \"Look here, you fellows, I've got a glorious plan!\" exclaimed Gus suddenly.  \"What is it?\" they all cried.  But Gus's plan requires a new chapter.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  HOW A PLEASANT TREAT IN STORE WAS PREPARED FOR MY MASTER.  Gus proceeded then to divulge his plan for giving Tom Drift his revenge on my master.  \"Let's take him to Gurley races on Saturday,\" said he.  \"You know it's a holiday, and if we can only get him with us, well astonish his sanctimonious young soul.  What do you say?\"  \"You'll never get him to come,\" said Margetson.  \"Won't we?  Well see about that,\" replied Gus, \"he needn't know where he's going.\"  \"But even so,\" said Drift, \"you won't get him; he's not in love with me, and I don't fancy any of you are much in his line.\"  \"Oh, you'll have to manage that part, Tom.  You know how the young idiot's pining to make it up with you, for your dear old mother's sake!\"  \"Now you needn't start that nonsense again,\" put in Tom sulkily.  \"All right; but don't you see, if you were to take a forgiving fit and make up to him, and talk about the old lady and his watch, and all that, he'd be out of his wits with joy? and then if you asked him to come for a day's fishing on Saturday, we could meet you somewhere on the road, and then he'd have to come whether he liked or not; and won't we astonish him!\"  Tom mused a little.  \"It's not a bad idea,\" said he presently, \"if it would only work.  But I can't make up to the young puppy as you think.  Ten to one I should stop short in the middle and kick him.\"  \"That would spoil all the fun.  Try it on, any way, it'll be a nice little excitement to have young Innocent with us.  And now, Tom, where are blacks and reds; I'm just in the humour for a rubber, aren't you?\"  The host produced from a locked desk a dirty and much-worn pack of cards, and the party sat down to play.  They played for penny points, and as Gus and Margetson were partners, it is hardly necessary to say that Drift and his ill-looking friend lost every game.  Before this amiable and congenial quartet separated, Gus had referred again to the scheme of getting Charlie to Gurley races, and got Drift to promise he would secure his victim next day.  Next day, accordingly, as Charlie was in the midst of a desperate game of fives with his friend Jim, a small boy came to him and said that Tom Drift wanted him.  \"What for?\" demanded Charlie, who, since his talk with the elder Halliday, had felt somewhat \"shy\" about Tom.  \"I don't know,\" said the boy.  \"Your turn, Charlie,\" called out Jim from the end of the court.  Charlie took his turn while he was revolving on his answer to this mysterious summons.  \"What does that child want?\" inquired Jim, with all the loftiness of a second-form boy speaking of a first.  \"He says Tom Drift wants me.\"  \"Whew!\" whistled Jim, who of course knew the whole mystery of the affair between his chum and Tom; \"tell him to go to Jericho!  Look out for yourself!\"  And so saying, he took his turn with the ball.  \"That wouldn't do,\" said Charlie; \"I don't want to rile him.\"  \"_I'd_ like to have a chance,\" retorted the implacable Jim.  \"Well, then, tell him you can't come.  Here, young un, tell Tom Drift Charlie can't come.  Do you hear?  Cut your sticks!\"  But Charlie called the messenger back.  \"I _could_, go if I wanted, Jim. Better tell him I'd rather not come.  Say that, youngster--I'd rather not.\"  So off the youngster ran, and Charlie and Jim finished their game.  Of coarse, the youthful messenger gave Tom a full, true, and particular account of this conversation in all its details, which rendered that young gentleman rather less eager than ever for his enterprise. However, he had the fear of Gus before his eyes, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],["title","My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#0)"],["body","Friend Smith A Story of School and City Life  By Talbot Baines Reed ________________________________________________________________________ This is a curious book by the author.  It does not surprise us, because it has a long school-life section, but then it goes on to describe in rather frightening detail the life of a young clerk in London, trying to survive on a miserable pittance, living in a cheap lodging-house, and trying to keep up socially with his contemporaries.  He is loyal to his friends, and in particular to his friend Smith, whom he had met at school, which had been a school for troublesome and backward boys.  I think it rings very true.  There is a foreword which is as enthusiastic as I am about the book.  It still gives you a lot to think about.  It was quite a true image even when I was young myself and trying to make my way in London, and from what I hear of the tribulations of the young, it is probably not far from the truth today.

NH. ________________________________________________________________________ MY FRIEND SMITH A STORY OF SCHOOL AND CITY LIFE  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  HOW I CAME TO BE SENT TO STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.  \"It was perfectly plain, Hudson, the boy could not be allowed to remain any longer a disgrace to the neighbourhood,\" said my uncle.  \"But, sir,\" began my poor old nurse.  \"That will do, Hudson,\" said my uncle, decisively; \"the matter is settled--Frederick is going to Stonebridge House on Monday.\"  And my uncle stood up, and taking a coat-tail under each arm, established himself upon the hearthrug, with his back to Mrs Hudson. That was always a sign there was no more to be said; and off I was trotted out of the dreaded presence, not very sure whether to be elated or depressed by the conversation I had overheard.  And indeed I never was quite clear as to why, at the tender and guileless age of twelve, I was abruptly sent away from my native village of Brownstroke, to that select and popular \"Academy for Backward and Troublesome Young Gentlemen,\" (so the advertisement ran), known as Stonebridge House, in the neighbourhood of Cliffshire.  Other people appeared to divine the reason, and Mrs Hudson shook her head and wiped her eyes when I consulted her on the subject.  It was queer.  \"I must be a very backward boy,\" thought I to myself, \"for try as I will, I don't see it.\"  You must know I was an orphan.  I never could recollect my mother--nor could Mrs Hudson.  As to my father, all I could recall of him was that he had bushy eyebrows, and used to tell me some most wonderful stories about lions and tigers and other beasts of prey, and used now and then to show me my mother's likeness in a locket that hung on his watch- chain.  They were both dead, and so I came to live with my uncle.  Now, I could hardly tell why, but it never seemed to me as if my uncle appeared to regard it as a privilege to have me to take care of.  He didn't whack me as some fellows' uncles do, nor did he particularly interfere with my concerns, as the manner of other uncles (so I am told), is.  He just took as little notice as possible of me, and as long as I went regularly to Mrs Wren's grammar-school in the village, and as long as Mrs Hudson kept my garments in proper order, and as long as I showed up duly on state occasions, and didn't bring more than a square inch of clay on each heel (there was a natural affinity between clay and my heels), into his drawing-room, he scarcely seemed to be aware that his house possessed such a treasure as an only nephew.  The part of my life I liked least was the grammar-school.  That was a horrid place.  Mrs Wren was a good old soul, who spent one half of her time looking over her spectacles, and the other half under them, for something she never found.  We big boys--for twelve is a good age for a dame's grammar-school--we didn't exactly get on at old Jenny Wren's, as she was called.  For we gradually discovered we knew almost as much as she did herself, and it dawned on us by degrees that somehow she didn't know how to keep us in order.  The consequence was, one or two boys, especially Jimmy Bates, the parish clerk's son, and Joe Bobbins, the Italian oil and colourman's son, didn't behave very well.  I was sorry to see it, and always told them so.  They got us other boys into all sorts of scrapes and trouble.  One day they would hide poor Jenny's spectacles, and then when search was made the lost treasure would be found in some one else's desk.  Or they would tie cotton reels on the four feet and tail of the old tabby cat, and launch her, with a horrid clatter, right into the middle of the room, just as I or one of the others happened to be scampering out.  Or they would turn the little boys' forms upside down, and compel them with terrible threats to sit on the iron feet, and then in the middle of the class \"sneak\" about them.  Poor Jenny couldn't manage the school at all, with such boys as Jimmy Bates and Joe Bobbins in it.  Up to boys of ten she was all right; but over ten she was all at sea.  However, she worked patiently on, and taught us all she could, and once or twice gave us a horrible fright by calling up at our houses, and reporting progress there (Mrs Hudson always received her when she came up to my uncle's).  And for all I know I might be at Jenny Wren's school still if a tremendous event hadn't happened in our village, which utterly upset the oldest established customs of Brownstroke.  We grammar-school boys never \"hit\" it exactly with the other town boys. Either they were jealous of us or we were jealous of them.  I don't know, but we hated the town boys, and they hated us.  Once or twice we had come into collision, though they always got the best of it.  One winter they snowballed us to such a pitch that as long as the snow was on the ground a lot of the little kids would no more venture to school alone than a sane man would step over the side of a balloon.  Another time they lined the street down both sides, and laughed and pointed at us as we walked to school.  That was far worse than snowballs, even with stones in them.  You should have seen us, with pale faces and hurried steps, making our way amid the jeers and gibes of our tormentors--some of the little ones blubbering, one or two of the bigger ones looking hardly comfortable, and a few of the biggest inwardly ruminating when and how it would best be possible to kill that Runnit the news-boy, or Hodge the cow-boy!  These and many other torments and terrors we \"Jenny Wrenites\" had endured at the hands of our enemies the town boys, on the whole patiently.  In process of time they got tired of one sort of torment, and before their learned heads had had time to invent a new one, we had had time to muster up courage and tell one another we didn't care what they did.  Such a period had occurred just before my story opens.  It was a whole month since the town boys had made our lives unhappy by calling, and howling, and yelling, and squeaking on every occasion they met us the following apparently inoffensive couplet:--  \"A, B, C, Look at the baby!\"  How we hated that cry, and quailed when we heard it!  However, after about a fortnight's diligent use of this terrible weapon the town boys subsided for a season, and we plucked up heart again.  Four whole weeks passed, and we were never once molested!  Something must be wrong in the village!  Of course we all came to the conclusion that the town boys had at last seen the error of their ways, and were turning over new leaves.  Rash dream!  One day when we were least expecting it, the \"Philistines were upon us\" again, and this time their device was to snatch off our caps!  It was too terrible to think of!  We could endure to be hooted at, and pelted, and said \"A, B, C\" to, but to have our little Scotch caps snatched off our heads and tossed over pailings and into puddles, was too much even for the meek disciples of Jenny Wren.  The poor little boys got their mothers to fasten elastics to go under their chins, and even so walked nearly half a mile round to avoid the market cross.  It was no use, the manoeuvre was discovered, and not only did the youngsters have their caps taken, but were flipped violently by the elastics in the face and about the ears in doing so.  As for us older ones, some ran, other walked with their caps under their tunics, others held them on with both hands.  The result was the same; our caps were captured!  Then did Jimmy Bates, and Joe Bobbins, and Harry Rasper, and I, meet one day, and declare to one another, that this sort of thing was not to be stood.  \"Let's tell Mother Wren,\" said one.  \"Or the policeman,\" said another.  \"Let's write and tell Fred Batchelor's uncle,\" said another.  That referred to my relative, who was always counted a \"nob\" in the village.  \"I say, don't do any,\" said the redoubtable Bobbins.  \"The next time they do it to me _I_ mean to kick!\"  The sentiment was loudly applauded, and a regular council of war was held, with the following decision.  We four were to go home together that afternoon, and without waiting to be chased, would ourselves give chase to the first bully we saw, and take _his_ cap!  The consequences of course might be fearful--fatal; but the blood of the \"Jenny Wrenites\" was up.  Do it we would, or perish in the attempt.  I think we all got a little nervous as the afternoon school wore on and the hour for departing approached.  Indeed, when we were about to start, Bates looked very like deserting straight away.  \"Oh, you three go on,\" he said, \"I'll catch you up; I just want to speak to Jenny.\"  \"No we don't,\" we all protested; \"we'll wait here, if it takes you till midnight to say what you've got to say to Jenny.\"  This valiant determination put an end to Bates's wavering, and with a rueful face he joined us.  \"Now, mind,\" said Rasper, \"the first you see!\"  \"Well,\" exclaimed I, starting suddenly to run, \"that's Cad Prog, the "]]]
