Park, however, witnessed numerous instances of the sad effects of the slave trade.  A singing man, the master of one of the slaves who had travelled for some time with great difficulty, and was found unable to proceed further, proposed to exchange him for a young slave girl belonging to one of the townspeople.  The poor girl was ignorant of her fate until the bundles were all laid up in the morning, and the coffle ready to depart, when, coming with some of the other young women to see the coffle set out, her master took her by the hand and delivered her to the singing man.  Never was a face of serenity more suddenly changed into one of the deepest distress; the terror she manifested on having the load put on her head and the rope round her neck, and the sorrow with which she bid adieu to her companions, were truly affecting. Notwithstanding the treatment which the slaves received, they had hearts which could feel for the white stranger amidst their infinitely greater sufferings, and they frequently of their own accord brought water to quench his thirst, and at night collected branches and leaves for his bed, during that weary journey of more than five hundred British miles.  Knowing that the greater number were doomed to a life of slavery in a foreign land, he could not part from them without feeling much emotion.  At last Pisania was reached, and Park was warmly welcomed as one risen from the dead by the Mr Ainsleys and Dr Laidley.  They had heard that the Moors had murdered him as they had murdered Major Haughton.  He learned with great sorrow that neither of his two attendants, Johnson and Demba, had returned, and that nothing was known of them.  Park gave double the amount he had promised to Kafa, and sent a present also to the good old schoolmaster at Malacotta.  Kafa, who had never before heard English spoken, listened with great attention to Park, when conversing with his friends.  His astonishment at the various articles of furniture in the houses was very great; but it was still greater when he saw Mr Ainsley's schooner lying in the river.  He could not comprehend the use of the masts and sails, or conceive how so large a body could be moved by the wind.  He was frequently heard to exclaim, with a sigh: \"Ah! black men are nothing.\"  After waiting at Pisania some time, finding no vessel likely to sail direct for England, he took his passage on board a slave vessel bound for South Carolina.  She, however, meeting with bad weather, put into Antigua, and from thence he sailed in an English packet, and arrived at Falmouth on the 22nd of December, having been from England about two years and seven months.

Soon after his return to England Park married the daughter of Mr Anderson, with whom he had served his apprenticeship, and resided a couple of years with his mother and one of his brothers on the farm that his father had occupied at Fowlshiels, in Scotland.  After this he practised his profession for some time at Peebles.  But this sort of life not satisfying his ardent temperament, on hearing from Sir Joseph Banks that another expedition into Africa to explore the Niger was proposed, he at once offered his services.  Nothing, however, was settled till the year 1803, when, being directed to hold himself in readiness to proceed to Africa, he engaged a native of Mogadore, named Sidi Omback Boubi, then residing in London, to accompany him to Scotland for the purpose of instructing him in Arabic.  Nearly another year passed before all arrangements were concluded.  It was finally determined that the expedition should consist of Park himself, his brother-in-law (Mr Anderson), and Mr George Scott, who was to act as draughtsman, together with a few boat-builders and artificers.  They were to be joined at Goree by a party of soldiers of the African corps stationed in that garrison.  Three months after this elapsed ere they set sail on board the \"Crescent\" transport on the 30th of January, 1805; and, after touching at Saint Jago to obtain asses for the journey, they reached Goree on the 28th of March.  There was no lack of volunteers, the whole garrison offering their services.  Thirty-five soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Martyn of the Royal Artillery Corps were selected, as well as two sailors from the \"Squirrel\" frigate.  They left Goree on the 6th of April, the men jumping into the boats in the highest spirits, and bidding adieu to their friends with repeated huzzas.  Landing at Kayee on the northern bank of the Gambia, they commenced their overland journey to Pisania on the 27th of April.  The weather was intensely hot, and the asses, unaccustomed to carry loads, made their march very fatiguing and troublesome, three of the animals sticking fast in a muddy rice field soon after they started.  So many delays had occurred that the rainy season was already approaching, and it would have been more prudent had the expedition remained at Goree or Pisania till the country had become again suitable for travelling.  It was just possible, however, that they might reach the Niger before the middle of June, when the rainy season usually commences, and that river could then have been navigated without much exposure or toil.  So eager, however, was Mr Park to proceed, that he disregarded the warnings of his friends, and determined to set forth on his journey.  Several days were lost at Pisania in arranging the burdens of the asses and in purchasing more animals, as those they possessed were not sufficient for carrying all the loads.  He here engaged a Mandingo priest named Isaaco, who was also a travelling merchant, to serve as a guide, and, on the 4th of May, all being ready, the caravan set forth from Pisania, whence nearly ten years before Park had commenced his adventurous journey into the interior.  The arrangements for the march were well devised.  The animals as well as their loads were marked and numbered with red paint, and a certain number allotted to the care of each of the six messes into which the soldiers were divided.  Mr Scott and Isaaco generally led, Lieutenant Martyn marched in the centre, and Anderson and Park brought up the rear.  All their forethought, however, could not guard them against the deadly attacks of the climate.  The asses from the first gave them a great deal of trouble--many, from being overloaded, lying down in the road, while others kicked off their bundles--so that the caravan made but slow progress.  They had not gone far when two of the soldiers died, and, a few days afterwards, another lost his life.  At most of the places through which they passed they were well received; but at the town of Bady the chief man demanded enormously high duties, and sent a large band of armed followers to collect them.  When Isaaco was sent over to Bady to enquire the reason of this conduct, he was seized, his weapons taken from him, and he was tied to a tree and flogged.  It was proposed to attack the place; but early the next day the guide was sent back, and the matter was settled by payment of a portion of the duties demanded.  While halting at a creek, the asses being unloaded, some of the men went in search of honey.  Unfortunately they disturbed a large swarm of bees, which, rushing out, attacked both men and beasts.  The asses, being loose, galloped off, but the horses and people were fearfully stung.  A fire, which had been kindled for cooking, being deserted, spread in all directions, setting the bamboos in flames and very nearly destroying their luggage.  Two of the asses died here, and others were missing.  Several of the soldiers now fell sick, and were mounted on the horses and spare asses.  At Toombin, which the caravan reached on the 16th of June, in the neighbourhood of Malacotta, the good old schoolmaster, Park's former friend, arrived just as the baggage had started, having travelled all night to visit him.  Park invited him to go forward to the next place where they should halt, that he might reward him for his former kindness.  After leaving the village he found Hinton, one of the party, to whom Mr Anderson had lent his horse, lying under a tree, and the horse grazing at a little distance.  Park put the sick man on the horse and drove it before him, but was at length compelled to leave him.  A mile further on he came to two others lying in the shade of a tree, whom he placed on his own and Mr Anderson's horses, and carried on to the next village. Hence he sent back for poor Hinton, and left the three in charge of the _dooty_, giving him beads to purchase provisions for them should they live, and to bury them if they died.  On the 22nd one of the carpenters was also left behind at his own request.  A soldier, Bloore, lost his way in the woods while looking for an ass which had strayed, and in the search another sick man, Walter, was found.

'Up the Country' and 'The City Bushman', included in this selection, were two of Lawson's contributions to the debate.  Please note that this is the revised edition of 1900.

In the gusty old weather,      When our hopes and our troubles were new,      In the years spent in wearing out leather,      I found you unselfish and true --      I have gathered these verses together      For the sake of our friendship and you.       You may think for awhile, and with reason,      Though still with a kindly regret,      That I've left it full late in the season      To prove I remember you yet;      But you'll never judge me by their treason      Who profit by friends -- and forget.       I remember, Old Man, I remember --      The tracks that we followed are clear --      The jovial last nights of December,      The solemn first days of the year,      Long tramps through the clearings and timber,      Short partings on platform and pier.       I can still feel the spirit that bore us,      And often the old stars will shine --      I remember the last spree in chorus      For the sake of that other Lang Syne,      When the tracks lay divided before us,      Your path through the future and mine.       Through the frost-wind that cut like whip-lashes,      Through the ever-blind haze of the drought --      And in fancy at times by the flashes      Of light in the darkness of doubt --      I have followed the tent poles and ashes      Of camps that we moved further out.       You will find in these pages a trace of      That side of our past which was bright,      And recognise sometimes the face of      A friend who has dropped out of sight --      I send them along in the place of      The letters I promised to write.

When the North was hale in the march of Time,    and the South and the West were new,  And the gorgeous East was a pantomime, as it seemed in our boyhood's view;  When Spain was first on the waves of change,    and proud in the ranks of pride,  And all was wonderful, new and strange in the days when the world was wide.   Then a man could fight if his heart were bold,    and win if his faith were true --  Were it love, or honour, or power, or gold, or all that our hearts pursue;  Could live to the world for the family name, or die for the family pride,  Could fly from sorrow, and wrong, and shame    in the days when the world was wide.   They sailed away in the ships that sailed ere science controlled the main,  When the strong, brave heart of a man prevailed    as 'twill never prevail again;  They knew not whither, nor much they cared --    let Fate or the winds decide --  The worst of the Great Unknown they dared    in the days when the world was wide.   They raised new stars on the silent sea that filled their hearts with awe;  They came to many a strange countree and marvellous sights they saw.  The villagers gaped at the tales they told,    and old eyes glistened with pride --  When barbarous cities were paved with gold    in the days when"]]]
