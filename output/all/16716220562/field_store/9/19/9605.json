Fisheries (#3)"],["body","yard.  \"What's the difference between a 'finback' and a 'humpback,' Hank?\" asked the boy, after the canvas had been stowed, the vessel under auxiliary steam having speed enough to keep up with the cetaceans, \"are they 'right' whales?\"  \"Neither of 'em,\" the gunner replied: \"there's two kinds of right whale, the bowhead and the black, and both have fine whalebone, an' that, as you know, is a sort of strainer in the mouth that takes the place of teeth. Humpbacks an' finbacks are taken for oil, an' they look quite different. A humpback is more in bulk an' has only a short fin on the back, it's a clumsy beast an' throws the flukes of the tail out of the water in soundin'. Now, a finback is built more for speed an' has a big fin on the back--that's where it gets its name. The big sulphurbottom is a kind of finback, an' is the largest animal livin'. I've seen one eighty-five feet long!\"  \"Where does the sperm whale come in?\" asked Colin.  \"It's got teeth, like the gray whale,\" was the reply, \"but you never find it in cold water. Sperm whalin' is comin' into favor again. But those two over there--the ones we're after, are finbacks. You can tell by the spout, by the fin, by not seein' the flukes of the tail, an' by the way they play around, slappin' each other in fun.\"  Three hours were spent in the fruitless chase after this little group of whales. Then Hank, who had been standing in the bow beside the gun, watching every move of the cetacean during the afternoon, suddenly signaled with his hand for \"full speed astern,\" by this maneuver stopping the ship squarely, as a whale--a medium-sized finback--came up right under the vessel's bow. The reversed screws took the craft astern so as to show the broad back about twenty-five feet away, and Hank fired.  The crashing roar of the harpoon-gun was followed by a swirl as the whale sounded for a long dive, but a moment later there came a dull, muffled report from the water, the explosive head of the harpoon, known as the 'bomb,' having burst. For a minute or two there was no sound but the swish of the line and the clank of the big winch as it ran out, while the animal sank to the bottom. There was a moment's wait, and then Hank, seeing the line tauten and hang down straight, called back:  \"We can haul in, sir; I got him just right.\"  Compared to the excitement of the chase in the open boat this seemed very tame to Colin, and he said so to the captain, when he went aft, while the steam-winch gradually drew up the finback whose end had come so suddenly.  \"My boy,\" was the reply, \"I'm not whaling for my health. Other people have a share in this, besides myself and the crew, and what they're after is whales--not sport. The business isn't what it was; in the old days whale-oil was worth a great deal and whaling was a good business. Then came the discovery of petroleum and the Standard Oil Company soon found out ways of refining the crude product so that it took the place of whale-oil in every way and at a cheaper price.\"  \"But I thought whalebone was what you were after!\" said Colin in surprise.  \"It was for a time,\" the captain answered, \"after the oil business gave out. But within the last ten years there have been so many substitutes for whalebone that its value has gone down. There's a lot of whalebone stored in New Bedford warehouses that can't be sold except at a loss.\"  \"Well, if the oil is replaced and whalebone has no value, what is to be got out of whaling now, then?\" the boy queried.  \"Oil again,\" was the reply; \"for fine lubricating work there's nothing as good. It's queer, though, how things have changed around. Fifty years ago, New Bedford was the greatest whaling port in the world, ten years ago there wasn't a ship there, they had all gone to San Francisco. Now 'Frisco is deserted by whalers, and the few in the business have gone back to the old port.\"  In the meantime, while Colin had been telling the story of the adventure with the gray whale, and the captain had been bemoaning the decay of the whaling industry, the work of bringing the dead whale to the surface had been under way. Letting out more slack on the rope attached to the harpoon a bight of it was passed through a sheave-block at the masthead, thus giving a greater purchase for the lifting of the heavy body. The winch was run by a small donkey-engine, and for about ten minutes the line was hauled in, fathom after fathom being coiled on the deck. Presently, as Colin looked over the rail, the dark body of the whale was seen coming to the surface, and as he was hauled alongside a chain was thrown around his flukes, and the body was made fast to the vessel, tail foremost.  Just as soon as the whale was secured a sailor jumped on the body, carrying with him a long steel tube, pierced with a number of holes for several inches from the bottom. To this he attached a long rubber tube, while the other end was connected with a small air-pump. The ever-handy donkey-engine was used to work the pump, and the body of the whale was slowly filled with air in the same way that a bicycle tire is inflated.  \"What's that for?\" asked Colin, who had been watching the process with much curiosity.  \"So that he will float,\" the captain answered. \"You can't tow a whale that's lying on the bottom!\"  \"But I thought you were going to cut him up!\"  \"And boil down the blubber on board?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That's very seldom done now,\" the captain explained. \"In the old days, when whaling-ships went on three and four year voyages they 'fleshed' the blubber at sea and boiled it down or 'tried it out,' as they called it, into oil. They always carried a cooper along, too, and made their own barrels, so that after a long voyage a ship would come back with her hold full of barrels of whale-oil.\"  \"What's the method now, Captain Murchison?\" asked Colin.  \"Nearly all whaling is done by steamers and not very far from the coast, say within a day's steaming. We catch the whales, blow them out in the way you see the men doing now, and tow them to the nearest 'trying out' factory. These places have conveniences that would be impossible on shipboard, they get a better quality of oil, and they use up all the animal, getting oil out of the meat as well as the blubber. Then the flesh is dried and sold for fertilizer just as the bones are. The fins and tail are shipped to Japan for table delicacies. Even the water in which the blubber has been tried out makes good glue. So, you see, it pays to tow a whale to the factory. And besides, the smell of trying out on one of the old whalers was horrible beyond description.\"  During this explanation the huge carcass of the whale had been distended to almost twice its natural size, and now it floated high out of the water. The steel tube was pulled out and a buoy with a flag was attached to the whale, which was then set adrift to be picked up and towed to the factory later.  [Illustration: FINBACK WHALE SOUNDING.]  [Illustration: LANCING FINBACK: GIVING THE DEATH-BLOW.]  [Illustration: PUMPING CARCASS WITH AIR SO THAT IT WILL FLOAT.]  [Illustration: DEAD FINBACK SET ADRIFT WITH BUOY AND FLAG.  _All Photos by permission of Mr. Roy C. Andrews._]  Almost immediately the \"tink-tink\" of the bell of the signaler to the engine-room told that the ship was headed after another whale. The sea was rising and the wind was beginning to whistle through the rigging. Colin felt well satisfied that the canvas was stowed and that he would not have to go aloft during the night. The evening light, however, was still good enough for a shot, and Hank, at the bow, was swinging the heavy gun from side to side on its stand to assure himself that it was in good condition.  Owing to the approaching darkness, there was no time to wait for an exact shot, and Hank fired at the big finback on the first opportunity. The ship was rolling and pitching, however, and the harpoon, instead of striking the big whale, went clear over her and into the water beyond, crashing into the side of a little calf whale not more than sixteen feet long, the weapon going almost through him.  Apparently unconscious of what had happened to her baby, the mother whale sounded and sounded deep, not coming up for nearly twenty minutes. When she rose, she was at least a quarter of a mile away, and Colin, who was standing by Hank in the bow, wondered why the ship did not go in pursuit.  \"Why don't we chase her up?\" he asked.  \"She'll come lookin' for her calf,\" the old whaler answered, \"an' as long as we stay near that she'll come up to us. Lots of whalers shoot the calves a-purpose, makin' it easier to get the old whales, but I don't hold with that. I've never done it. Shootin' this one was just an accident, but as long as the little chap is dead anyhow, we might as well make use of him.\"  Just as the old whaler had predicted, in less than five minutes the mother whale spouted, coming in the direction of the vessel. In less than five minutes more she spouted again, just a little distance from the calf. Not understanding what had happened, she swam around as though to persuade the little one to follow her, and as she circled round the calf she came within range of the harpoon-gun. It was far too dark to see clearly, but Hank chanced a shot. The sudden roar startled Colin.  \"Did you get her?\" he asked anxiously.  \"I hit her, all right,\" the gunner answered with a dissatisfied air, \"but not just where I wanted.\"  The boy thought it wonderful that he should have been able to hit the monster at all, so small a portion of the body was exposed and so heavily was the _Gull_ pitching. The whale, instead of sounding directly, dived at a sharp angle and the line ran out like lightning.  \"What's that, Hank?\" asked Colin in a startled voice, pointing over to the water just below the little calf, which had been hauled in by hand alongside the ship.  \"Killers, by all that's holy!\" ejaculated the whaler. \"They'll get every blessed whale we've landed to-day. Did you ever see such luck!\"  \"Wha"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21008"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Fisheries (#4)"],["body","are they after?\" asked Colin, \"the calf whale?\"  \"Yes, or any other of 'em. See, the mother has smelt 'em and knows they mean harm for the baby.\"  It was growing dark and Colin leaned over the rail to see. Suddenly up from the deep, with a rush as of a pack of maddened hounds, ten or a dozen ferocious creatures, from fifteen to twenty feet in length, snatched and bit and tore at the body of the baby whale. A big white spot behind each eye looked like a fearful organ of vision, their white and yellowish undersides and black backs flashed and gleamed and the big fins cut the water like swords. The huge curved teeth gleamed in the reddened water as the 'tigers of the sea' lashed round, infuriated with lust for blood.  Then with a violent gesture of reminder, as though he had forgotten that which was of prime importance, Hank took a few quick steps to the rope that held fast the baby whale to the ship and cut it with his sheath-knife.  \"What's that for?\" said Colin.  \"Let's get away from here,\" Hank replied, and signaled to go ahead.  As he did so, the mother whale caught sight of the remains of the body of the little one sinking through the water and dashed for it. Colin could have shouted with triumph in the hope that vengeance would be served out upon the orcas, but he was not prepared for the next turn in the tragedy. Like a pack of ravening wolves the killers hurled themselves at the mother whale, three of them at one time fastening themselves with a rending grip upon the soft lower lip, others striking viciously with their rows of sharp teeth at her eyes. The issue was not in doubt for a minute. No creature could endure such savage ferocity and such united attack. The immense whale threshed from side to side, always round the vessel, which seemed still to carry to her the scent of the baby whale.  \"Has she any chance?\" the boy asked, full of pity for the victim of such rapacity.  \"Not the ghost of a chance,\" the whaler answered.  For a minute or two the whale seemed to have thrown off her demon foes and turned away, but scarcely a moment was she left alone, for up in front of her again charged five or six killers, rending and tearing at her head, and the whale, blinded, gashed in a thousand places and maddened by fear and pain, fled in the opposite direction.  Colin heard the captain give a wild cry from the poop and felt the engines stop and reverse beneath him. He cast one glance over the rail and like every man on board was struck motionless and silent. In the phosphorescent gleams of the waves churned up by the incredible muscular power of the killers, the old whale--sixty feet in length at least, and weighing hundreds of tons--was rushing at a maddened spurt of fifteen or even twenty miles an hour straight for the vessel's side, where a blind instinct made her believe her calf still was to be found. There was a death-like pause and then--a shock.  Almost every man aboard was thrown to the deck, and the vessel heeled over to starboard until it seemed she must turn turtle. But she righted herself, heavily and with a sick lurch that spoke of disaster. The ship's carpenter ran to the pumps and sounded the well.  \"Four inches, sir!\" he called.  A moment later he dropped the rod again.  \"Five and a half inches, sir,\" he cried, \"an' comin' in fast.\"  It hardly needed the carpenter to tell the story, for the ship had a heavy list to starboard. In a minute or two the stokers came up from below and close upon their heels, the engineer.  \"The water is close to the fire-boxes, Captain Murchison,\" he said.  \"I know, Mr. Macdonald,\" the captain answered. \"Boat stations!\" he cried.  \"I'm thinkin',\" the engineer said quietly, looking at the windy sky and stormy sea, the last streaks of twilight disappearing in the west, \"I'm thinkin' it may be a wee bit cold. Are we far from land, Captain?\"  \"We're none too close,\" the skipper said shortly. \"Cook,\" he called, \"are the boats provisioned?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Water-casks in and filled?\"  Every boat reported casks in good condition.  \"Sound the well, carpenter.\"  The sounding-rod was dropped and the wet portion measured.  \"Nine inches, sir.\"  \"You've got time to get what you want from below, boys,\" said the captain, as soon as the boats were all swung out on the davits; \"she won't go down all of a hurry. Slide into warm clothes, all of you, and get a move on. Stand by to clear.\"  He waited a minute or two, then noticed one of the sailors busy on deck.  \"What are you doing there, Scotty?\" he called out.  \"Putting a buoy on the line, sir; she's our whale.\"  \"Looks to me more as though the whale had us, than we had the whale,\" the captain said grimly. \"Are you all ready?\" he added as the men came up from the fo'c'sle in oilskins and mittens. \"No, there's only fifteen of you!\"  \"I'm here, Captain Murchison,\" spoke up Colin, emerging from the companion hatch with a heavy pilot coat. \"I thought you'd need something for the boats, too.\"  The captain nodded his thanks.  \"Lower away the whale-boat first,\" the captain said. \"Never mind me, I'll come along presently. Look alive there! That's the idea, Hank! All right? Cast off. Lower away the big pram! All right. Get busy on that small pram, there. Here you, Gloomy, if I have to come down there----! All ready? Lower away. If you don't manage any better than that you'll never see land, I can tell you. Cast off.\"  The _Gull_ was rolling heavily with an uneven drunken stagger that told how fast she was filling, and the starboard rail was close to the water's edge. The captain ran his eye over the boats and counted the men to see that all had embarked safely.  \"Don't bring her too close, Hank!\" he cried warningly, as he saw the old whaler edge the boat toward him, and stepping on the poop-rail, he jumped into the sea. But the gunner, judging accurately the swell of the waves, brought the boat to the very spot where the captain had struck the water and hoisted him on board. Without a word he made his way to the stern and took the tiller.  The boat pulled away a score of strokes or so and then the men rested on their oars. The sunset colors had faded utterly but a dim after-glow remained, and overhead a young moon shone wanly through black wisps of scudding cloud. The _Gull_ sank slowly by the bow.  \"She's one of the last of the old-timers,\" said the captain sadly. \"This was her seventieth whaling season and that's old age for ship as well as man. I wish, though----\"  \"What is it, Captain Murchison?\" asked Colin.  \"Ah, it's nothing, boy,\" was the reply. \"Only we're foolish over things we love, and the _Gull_ was all that I had left. It's a dark and lonely death she's having there. I wish----\"  \"Yes, sir?\" the boy whispered.  \"I wish she'd had her lights,\" the captain said, and his hands were trembling on the tiller, \"it's hard to die in the dark.\"  For a moment Colin had a wild idea of leaping into the sea and swimming to the sinking craft, and blamed himself bitterly for not having looked after the port and starboard lights at sundown, as he often did when the watch on deck was too busy to see to them. He would have given anything to have done it, rather than to have to sit beside the captain with his eyes fixed on the desolate unlighted ship! Boy though he was, he nearly broke down.  \"Good-by, _Gull_, good-by,\" he heard the captain whisper under his breath.  Then, as if the ache in the boy's heart had been a flame to cross the sea, it seemed that a tiny spark kindled upon the sinking ship, and the captain, speechless for the moment, pointed at it.  \"Is that a light, boy?\" he said hoarsely, \"or am I going mad?\"  Like a flash, Colin remembered.  \"It's the binnacle, sir,\" he cried; \"I lighted it for the man at the wheel myself.\"  Solemnly the captain took off his hat.  \"It's where the light should be,\" he said at last, \"to shine upon her course to the very end.\"     CHAPTER II  THE FIGHT OF THE OLD BULL SEALS   The quick, uneasy pitching of the boat and a sudden dash of ice-cold spray roused the captain from the fit of abstraction into which the sinking of his ship had plunged him.  \"Step the mast, men,\" he said; \"we've got to make for the nearest land. It's going to be a dirty night, too.\"  \"Did you want us to put a reef in, sir?\" asked the old whaler.  \"When I want a sail reefed,\" the captain answered shortly, \"I'll tell you.\"  As the mast fell into place and the sail was hoisted, the whale-boat heeled sharply over and began to cut her way through the water at a good speed, leaving the two prams far in the rear. The captain, who was steering mechanically, paid no heed to them, staring moodily ahead into the darkness. Hank looked around uneasily from time to time, then in a few moments he spoke.  \"The mate's signaling, I think, sir,\" he said.  Colin looked round but could only just see the outline of the larger of the two boats, and knew it was too dark to distinguish any motions on board her. He looked inquiringly at Hank, but the old gunner was watching the captain.  \"What does he want?\" questioned the captain angrily.  \"Orders, sir, I suppose,\" the whaler answered.  The captain felt the implied rebuke and looked at him sharply, but although he was a strict disciplinarian, he knew Hank's worth as a seaman of experience and kept back the sharp reply which was upon his lips. Then turning in his seat he realized how rapidly they had sped away from the boats they were escorting, and said:  \"I'll bring her up.\"  He put the tiller over and brought the whale-boat up into the wind, and in a few minutes the mate's boat and the smaller pram came alongside.  \"Don't you want us to keep together, sir?\" cried the mate as soon as he was within hearing.  \"Of course,\" the captain answered. \"You can't keep up, eh?\"  \"Not in a breeze like this, sir,\" the mate declared.  \"All right, then,\" was the response; \"we'll reef.\" He nodded to the gunner and the reef points were quickly tied, thus enabling the three boats to keep together.
