It was to desist from their threatening strife and extinguish the flames that still flared up over the waggons. He who spoke was the one with the red cross upon his breast, its bars of bright vermilion gleaming like fire against the sombre background of his skin.  He was the chief of the Tenawa Comanches--the Horned Lizard--as Wilder had justly conjectured.  And as their chief he was instantly obeyed.  The wranglers, one and all, promptly suspended their disputes; and flinging their weapons aside, at once set to carrying out his orders.  Seizing upon the shovels, late dropped from the hands of their now lifeless antagonists, and plying them to better purpose, they soon smothered the flame, and the smoke too, till only a thin drift stole up through the sand thrown thickly over it.  Meanwhile a man, in appearance somewhat differing from the rest, was seen moving among them.  Indian in garb and guise, savage in his accoutrements, as the colour of his skin, he nevertheless, showed features more resembling races that are civilised.  His countenance was of a cast apparently Caucasian, its lineaments unlike those of the American aboriginal; above all, unlike in his having a heavy beard, growing well forward upon his cheeks, and bushing down below the chin.  True, that among the Comanche Indians bearded men are occasionally met with--_mestizos_, the descendants of renegade whites.  But none paraded as he, who now appeared stalking around the ruined caravan.  And there was another individual by his side, who had also hair upon his cheeks, though thinner and more straggling; while the speech passing between the two was not the guttural tongue of the Tenawa Comanches, but pure Mexican Spanish.  Both were on foot, having dismounted; he with the heavy beard leading, the other keeping after as if in attendance.  The former flitted from one to another of those who lay slain; in turn stooping over each corpse, and scrutinising it--to some giving but a cursory glance, to others more careful examination--then leaving each with an air of disappointment, and a corresponding exclamation.  At length, after going the complete round of the dead, he faced towards his satellite, saying,--  \"_Por dios_! he don't appear to be among them!  What can it mean?  There could be no doubt of his intention to accompany the caravan.  Here it is, and here we are; but where is he?  _Carajo_!  If he has escaped me, I shall feel as if I'd had all this trouble for nothing.\"  \"Think of the precious plunder,\" rejoined the other.  \"These grand _carretas_ are loaded with rich goods.  Surely they don't count for nothing.\"  \"A fig for the goods!  I'd give more for his scalp than all the silks and satins that were ever carried to Santa Fe.  Not that I'd care to keep such a trifle.  The Horned Lizard will be welcome to it, soon as I see it stripped from his skull.  That's what I want to see.  But where is it?  Where is he?  Certainly not among these.  There isn't one of them the least like him.  Surely it must be his party, spoken of in his letter?  No other has been heard of coming by this route.  There they lie, all stark and staring--men, mules, and horses--all but him.\"  The smoke has thinned off, only a thin film still wafting about the waggons, whose canvas tilts, now consumed, expose their contents--some of them badly burnt, some but slightly scorched.  The freebooters have commenced to drag out boxes and bales, their chief by a stern command having restrained them from returning to take the scalps of the slain. All has been the work of only a few moments--less than ten minutes of time--for it is scarce so much since Wilder and Hamersley, stealing out between the wheels, rode off under cover of the cloud.  By this he with the beard, speaking Spanish, has ceased to scrutinise the corpses, and stands facing his inferior, his countenance showing an air of puzzled disappointment, as proclaimed by his repeated speeches.  Once again he gives speech to his perplexity, exclaiming:  \"_Demonios_!  I don't understand it.  Is it possible that any of them can have got away?\"  As he puts the question there comes a shout from outside, seeming to answer it.  For it is a cry half in lamentation--a sort of wail, altogether unlike the charging war-whoop of the Comanches.  Acquainted with their signals, he knows that the one he has heard tells of an enemy trying to escape.  Hurrying outside the corral, he sees two mounted men, nearly a mile off, making in the direction of the cliffs.  And nearer, a score of other men, in the act of mounting, these being Indians, who have just caught sight of the fugitives, and are starting to pursue.  More eager than any, he rushes direct to his horse, and, having reached, bestrides him at a spring.  Then, plunging deep the spur, he dashed off across the plain towards the point where the two men are seen making away.  Who both may be he knows not, nor of one need he care; but of one he does, feeling sure it is the same for whom he has been searching among the slain.  \"Not dead yet, but soon shall be!\"  So mutters he, as with clenched teeth, bridle tight-drawn, and fingers firmly clasping the butt of a double-barrelled pistol, he spurs on after the two horsemen, who, heading straight for the cliff, seem as if they had no chance to escape; for their pursuers are closing after them in a cloud, dark as the dreaded \"norther\" that sweeps over the Texan desert, with shout symbolising the clangour that accompanies it.    CHAPTER TEN.  A BRAVE STEED ABANDONED.  In making his bold dash, Walt Wilder was not acting without a preconceived plan.  He had one.  The smoke, with its covering cloud, might be the means of concealment, and ultimate salvation; at all events, it would cover their retreat long enough to give them a start of the pursuers, and then the speed of their horses might possibly be depended upon for the rest.  They at first followed this plan, but unfortunately soon found that it would not long avail them.  The smoke was not drifting in the right direction.  The breeze carried it almost straight towards the line of the cliffs, while their only chance was to strike for the open plain. At the cliffs their flight would be stopped.  So far the smoke had favoured them.  Thick and stifling in the immediate vicinity of the waggons, it enabled them to slip unobserved through the ruck of savages.  Many of these, still mounted, had seen them pass outward, but through the blue film had mistaken them for two of their own men.  They perhaps knew nothing of there having been horses inside the corral, and did not expect to see any of their caged enemies attempting to escape in that way.  Besides, they were now busy endeavouring to extinguish the fires, all resistance being at an end.  As yet there was no sign of pursuit, and the fugitives rode up with the projecting _nimbus_ around them.  In the soft sand their horses' hoofs made no noise, and they galloped towards the cliff silent as spectres.  On reaching its base, it became necessary for them either to change the direction of their flight, or bring it to a termination.  The bluff towered vertically above them, like a wall of rude masonwork.  A cat could not have scaled it, much less horse, or man.  They did not think of making the attempt.  And now, what were they to do?  Ride out from the smoke-cloud, or remain under its favouring shelter?  In either case they were sure of being discovered and pursued.  It would soon clear off, and they would be seen from the waggons.  Already it was fast thinning around them; the Indians having nearly extinguished the fires in order to save the treasure, which had no doubt been their chief object for attacking the caravan. Soon there would be no smoke--and then?  The pursued men stayed not to reflect further.  Delay would only add to their danger; and with this thought urging them on, they wheeled their horses to the left, and headed along the line of the bluff.  Six seconds after they were riding in a pure atmosphere, under clear dazzling sunlight.  But it gave them no delight.  A yell from the savages told them they were seen, and simultaneously with the shout, they perceived a score of horsemen spurring from the crowd, and riding at full speed towards them.  They were both splendidly mounted, and might still have had a fair chance of escape; but now another sight met their eyes that once more almost drove them to despair.  A promontory of the cliff, stretching far out over the sandy plain, lay directly in their track.  Its point was nearer to the pursuers than to them.  Before they could reach, and turn it, their retreat would be intercepted.  Was there still a chance to escape in the opposite direction?  Again suddenly turning, they galloped back as they had come; again entered the belt of smoke; and, riding on through it, reached the clear sunlight beyond.  Again a torturing disappointment.  Another promontory--twin to the first--jutted out to obstruct them.  There was no mystery in the matter.  They saw the mistake they had made. In escaping under cover of the cloud they had gone too far, ridden direct into a deep embayment of the cliff!  Their pursuers, who had turned promptly as they, once more had the advantage.  The outlying point of rocks was nearer to them, and they would be almost certain to arrive at it first.  To the fugitives there appeared no alternative but to ride on, and take the chance of hewing their way through the savages surrounding--for certainly they would be surrounded.  \"Git your knife riddy, Frank!\" shouted Wilder, as he dug his heels into his horse's side and put the animal to full speed.  \"Let's keep close thegither--livin' or dead, let's keep thegither!\"  Their steeds needed no urging.  To an American horse accustomed to the prairies there is no spur like the yell of an Indian; for he knows that along with it usually comes the shock of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21240"],["title","The Lone Ranche (#8)"],["body","et, or the sting of a barbed shaft.  Both bounded off together, and went over the soft sand, silent, but swift as the wind.  In vain.  Before they could reach the projecting point, the savages had got up, and were clustering around it.  At least a score, with spears couched, bows bent, and clubs brandishing, stood ready to receive them.  It was a gauntlet the pursued men might well despair of being able to run.  Truly now seemed their retreat cut off, and surely did death appear to stare them in the face.  \"We must die, Walt,\" said the young prairie merchant, as he faced despairingly toward his companion.  \"Maybe not yet,\" answered Wilder, as with a searching glance, he directed his eye along the facade of the cliff.  The red sandstone rose rugged and frowning, full five hundred feet overhead.  To the superficial glance it seemed to forbid all chance either of being scaled, or affording concealment.  There was not even a boulder below, behind which they might find a momentary shelter from the shafts of the pursuers.  For all that, Wilder continued to scan it, as if recalling some old recollection.  \"This must be the place,\" he muttered.  \"It is, by God!\" he added more emphatically, at the same time wrenching his horse around, riding sharp off, and calling to his companion to follow him.  Hamersley obeyed, and rode after, without knowing what next.  But, in another instant, he divined the intent of this sudden change in the tactics of his fellow fugitive.  For before riding far his eyes fell upon a dark list, which indicated an opening in the escarpment.  It was a mere crack, or chine, scarce so wide as a doorway, and barely large enough to admit a man on horseback; though vertically it traversed the cliff to its top, splitting it from base to summit.  \"Off o' yur hoss!\" cried Wilder, as he pulled up in front of it, at the same time flinging himself from his own.  \"Drop the bridle, and leave him behint.  One o' 'em'll be enough for what I want, an' let that be myen.  Poor critter, it air a pity!  But it can't be helped.  We must hev some kiver to screen us.  Quick, Frank, or the skunks will be on to us!\"  Painful as it was to abandon his brave steed, Hamersley did as directed without knowing why.  The last speeches of the guide were somewhat enigmatical, though he presumed they meant an important signification.  Slipping down from his saddle, he stood by his horse's side, a noble steed, the best blood of his own State, Kentucky, famed for its fine stock.  The animal appeared to know that its master was about to part from it.  It turned its head towards him; and, with bent neck, and steaming nostrils, gave utterance to a low neigh that, while proclaiming affection, seemed to say, \"Why do you forsake me?\"  Under other circumstances the Kentuckian would have shed tears.  For months he and his horse had been as man and man together in many a long prairie journey--a companionship which unites the traveller to his steed in liens strong as human friendship, almost as lasting, and almost as painful to break.  So Frank Hamersley felt, as he flung the bridle back on the animal's withers--still retaining hold of the rein, loth to relinquish it.  But there was no alternative.  Behind were the shouting pursuers quickly coming on.  He could see their brandished spears glancing in the sun glare.  They would soon be within reach, thrusting through his body; their barbed blades piercing him between the ribs.  No time for sentiment nor dallying now, without the certainty of being slain.  He gave one last look at his steed, and then letting go the rein, turned away, as one who, by stern necessity, abandons a friend, fearing reproach for what he does, but without the power to explain it.  For a time the abandoned steed kept its place, with glances inquiringly sent after the master who had forsaken it.  Then, as the yelling crew came closer behind, it threw up its head, snorted, and tore off with trailing bridle.  Hamersley had turned to the guide, now also afoot, but still retaining hold of his horse, which he was conducting towards the crack in the cliff, with all his energies forcing it to follow him; for the animal moved reluctantly, as though suspecting danger inside the darksome cleft.  Still urging it on, he shouted back to the Kentuckian, \"You go first, Frank!  Up into the kanyon, without losin' a second's time.  Hyar, take my gun, an' load both, whiles I see to the closin' o' the gap.\"  Seizing both guns in his grasp, Hamersley sprang into the chine, stopping when he got well within its grim jaws.  Wilder went after, leading his steed, that still strained back upon the bridle.  There was a large stone across the aperture, over which the horse had to straddle.  This being above two feet in height, when the animal had got its forelegs over Wilder checked it to a stand.  Hitherto following him with forced obedience, it now trembled, and showed a strong determination to go back.  There was an expression, in its owner's eye it had never seen before--something that terribly frayed it.  But it could not now do this, though ever so inclined.  With its ribs close pressing the rocks on each side, it was unable to turn; while the bridle drawn firmly in front hindered it from retiring.  Hamersley, busily engaged in loading the rifles, nevertheless found time to glance at Wilder's doings, wondering what he was about.  \"It air a pity!\" soliloquised the latter, repeating his former words in similar tones of commiseration.  \"F'r all that, the thing must be done. If thar war a rock big enough, or a log, or anythin'.  No! thar ain't ne'er another chance to make kiver.  So hyar goes for a bit o' butcherin'.\"  As the guide thus delivered himself, Hamersley saw him jerk the bowie knife from his belt, its blade red and still reeking with human gore. In another instant its edge was drawn across the throat of the horse, from which the blood gushed forth in a thick, strong stream, like water from the spout of a pump.  The creature made a last desperate effort to get off, but with its forelegs over the rocks and head held down between them, it could not stir from the spot.  After a convulsive throe or two, it sank down till its ribs rested upon the straddled stone; and in this attitude it ended its life, the head after a time drooping down, the eyes apparently turned with a last reproachful look upon the master who had murdered it!  \"It hed to be did; thar war no help for it,\" said Wilder, as he hurriedly turned towards his companion, adding: \"Have you got the guns charged?\"  Hamersley made answer by handing him back his own rifle.  It was loaded and ready.  \"Darn the stinkin' cowarts!\" cried the guide, grasping the gun, and facing towards the plain.  \"I don't know how it may all eend, but this'll keep 'em off a while, anyhow.\"  As he spoke he threw himself behind the body of the slaughtered steed, which, sustained in an upright position between the counterpart walls, formed a safe barricade against the bullets and arrows of the Indians. These, now riding straight towards the spot, made the rocks resound with exclamations of surprise--shouts that spoke of a delayed, perhaps defeated, vengeance.  They took care, however, not to come within range of that long steel-grey tube, that, turning like a telescope on its pivot, commanded a semicircle of at least a hundred yards' radius round the opening in the cliff.  Despite all the earnestness of their vengeful anger, the pursuers were now fairly at bay, and for a time could be kept so.  Hamersley looked upon it as being but a respite--a mere temporary deliverance from danger, yet to terminate in death.  True, they had got into a position where, to all appearance, they could defend themselves as long as their ammunition lasted, or as they could withstand the agony of thirst or the cravings of hunger.  How were they to get out again? As well might they have been besieged in a cave, with no chance of sortie or escape.  These thoughts he communicated to his companion, as soon as they found time to talk.  \"Hunger an' thirst ain't nothin' to do wi' it,\" was Wilder response. \"We ain't a goin' to stay hyar not twenty minutes, if this child kin manage it as he intends ter do.  You don't s'pose I rushed into this hyar hole like a chased rabbit?  No, Frank; I've heern o' this place afore, from some fellers thet, like ourselves, made _cache_ in it from a band o' pursuin' Kimanch.  Thar's a way leads out at the back; an' just as soon as we kin throw dust in the eyes o' these yellin' varmints in front, we'll put straight for it.  I don't know what sort o' a passage thar is--up the rocks by some kind o' raven, I b'lieve.  We must do our best to find it.\"  \"But how do you intend to keep them from following us?  You speak of throwing dust in their eyes--how, Walt?\"  \"You wait, watch an' see.  You won't hev yur patience terrifically tried: for thar ain't much time to spare about it.  Thar's another passage up the cliffs, not far off; not a doubt but these Injuns know it; an' ef we don't make haste, they'll git up thar, and come in upon us by the back door, which trick won't do, nohowsomdever.  You keep yurself in readiness, and watch what I'm agoin' to do.  When you see me scoot up back'ards, follor 'ithout sayin' a word.\"  Hamersley promised compliance, and the guide, still kneeling behind the barricade he had so cruelly constructed, commenced a series of manoeuvres that held his companion in speechless conjecture.  He first placed his gun in such a position that the barrel, resting across the hips of the dead horse, projected beyond the tail.  In this position he made it fast, by tying the butt with a piece of string to a projecting part of the saddle.  He next took the cap from his head--a coonskin it was--and set it so that its upper edge could be seen alongside the pommel, and rising about three inches above the croup. The ruse was an old one, with some new additions and embellishments.  \"It's all done now,\" said"]]]
