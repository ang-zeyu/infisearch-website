But you are right, brother, in the present case; it appears quite useless, and only renders the thing more complex, and obscure.  Where there are many varieties or species of a family or order of animals, and where these species differ widely from each other in appearance and habits, then such minute classifications become necessary to assist one's memory; but I say again, brother, you are quite right as to the present case.  There is no need for the numerous divisions and subdivisions which have been made of the crocodile family.\"  \"Who made them, then?\" asked Francois.  \"Who!\" exclaimed Lucien, with some warmth; \"who but _closet_- naturalists, old mummy-hunters of museums!  Bah! it makes one angry.\"  As Lucien said this, his usually mild countenance exhibited an expression of mingled indignation and contempt.  \"What is there in it to make one angry?\" inquired Basil, looking up at his brother with some astonishment.  \"Why, to think,\" answered Lucien, \"that these same closet-naturalists should have built themselves up great names by sitting in their easy chairs measuring, and adding up, and classing into dry catalogues, objects which they knew very little about; and that little they obtained from the observations of others--true naturalists--men like the great Wilson--men who toiled, and travelled, and exposed themselves to countless dangers and fatigues for the purpose of collecting and observing; and then for these men to have the fruits of their labours filched from them, and descanted upon in dry arithmetical terms by these same catalogue-makers.--Bah!\"  \"Stay, brother; Wilson was not robbed of the fruits of his labours!  He became famous.\"  \"Yes, and he died from the struggles and hardships that made him so.  It reminds me of the fabled song of the swan, brother.  He told his beautiful tale, and died.  Ah!  Poor Wilson, he was a _true_ naturalist.\"  \"His name will live for ever.\"  \"Ay, that it will, when many of the _philosophic_ naturalists, now so much talked of, shall be forgotten, or only remembered to have their quaint theories laughed at, and their fabulous descriptions turned into ridicule.  Fortunately for Wilson, he was too poor and too humble to attract their patronage until his book was published.  Fortunately for him he knew no great Linneus or Count Buffon, else the vast stores which he had been at so much pains to collect would have been given to the world under another name.  Look at Bartram.\"  \"Bartram!\" exclaimed Francois; \"why, I never heard the name, Luce.\"  \"Nor I,\" added Basil.  \"There it is, you see.  Few know his name; and yet this same John Bartram, a farmer of Pennsylvania, who lived an hundred years ago, did more to spread, not only a knowledge of American plants, but the plants themselves, than any one who has lived since.  Most of the great gardens of England--Kew among the rest--are indebted to this indefatigable botanist for their American flora; and there were few of the naturalists of that time--Linneus not excepted--that were not largely indebted to him for their facts and their fame.  They took his plants and specimens--collected by arduous, toilsome, and perilous journeyings-- they put names to them--noble and kingly names--for king-sycophants most of them were, these same naturalists--they _described_ them as _they_ call it--such descriptions, indeed! and then adopted them as their own discoveries.  And what did they give John Bartram in return for all his trouble?  Why, the English king gave him 50 pounds to enable him to travel over thousands of miles of wilderness in search of rare plants, many of which on reaching England were worth hundreds of pounds each! This was all the poor botanist had for enriching the gardens of Kew, and sending over the first magnolias and tulip-trees that ever blossomed in England!  What did the scientific naturalists do for him?  They stole his histories and descriptions, and published them under their own names.  Now, brothers, what think you of it?  Is it not enough to spoil one's temper when one reflects upon such injustice?\"  Both Basil and Francois signified their assent.  \"It is to such men as Hearne, and Bartram, and Wilson, that we are indebted for all we know of natural history--at least, all that is worth knowing.  What to us is the dry knowledge of scientific classifications? For my part, I believe that the authors of them have obscured rather than simplified the knowledge of natural history.  Take an example. There is one before our eyes.  You see those long streamers hanging down from the live oaks?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" replied Francois; \"the Spanish moss.\"  \"Yes, Spanish moss, as we call it here, or _old-man's-beard_ moss, as they name it in other parts.  It is no moss, however, but a regular flowering plant, although a strange one.  Now, according to these philosophic naturalists, that long, stringy, silvery creeper, that looks very like an old man's beard, is of the same family of plants as the pineapple!\"  \"Ha! ha! ha!\" roared Francois; \"Spanish moss the same as a pineapple plant!  Why, they are no more like than my hat is to the steeple of a church.\"  \"They are unlike,\" continued Lucien, \"in every respect--in appearance, in properties, and uses; and yet, were you to consult the dry books of the closet-naturalists, you would learn that this Spanish moss (_Tillandsia_) was of a certain family of plants, and a few particulars of that sort, and that is all you would learn about it.  Now what is the value of such a knowledge?  What is it to compare with a knowledge of the appearance, the structure, and character of the plant--of its properties and the ends for which nature designed it--of its uses to the birds and beasts around--of its uses to man--how it makes his mattress to sleep on, stuffs his sofas, and saddles, and chairs equal to the best horse-hair, and would even feed his horse in case of a pinch?  In my opinion, these are the facts worth knowing; and who are the men who publish such facts to the world?  Not your closet-naturalists, I fancy.\"  \"True, very true, brother; but let us not vex ourselves about such things; go on, and tell us what you know of the crocodiles.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Lucien, returning to his natural tone and manner, \"as I have already said, the crocodiles are divided into three genera--_crocodiles_, _gavials_, and _alligators_.  It is Baron Cuvier who has made this distinction; and he rests it more upon the shape of the head and the set of the teeth, than upon any real difference in the appearance or habits of these animals.  The crocodiles have long, pointed, narrow snouts, and a large tooth in each side of the lower jaw, which, when the mouth shuts, passes into a groove in the upper.  `These are the _true_ crocodiles,' says Monsieur Cuvier.  The gavials have also long, pointed, narrow, roundish snouts, but their teeth are nearly equal-sized and even.  The alligators, on the contrary, have broad pike-shaped noses, with teeth very unequal, and one large one on each side of the lower jaw, that, when the mouth shuts, passes--not into a groove as with the crocodile--but, into a hole or socket in the upper jaw.  These are Monsieur Cuvier's distinctions; which he takes a world of pains to point out and prove.  He might, in my opinion, have spared himself the trouble, as there are so few varieties of the animal in existence, that they might have been treated of with greater simplicity as so many species of the genus `crocodile.'  \"Of the true crocodiles there are five species known.  Four of these are found in the rivers of Africa, while the fifth is an inhabitant of the West Indies and South America.  The gavial is found in Asia-- particularly in the Ganges and other Indian rivers, and is the crocodile of those parts.  The alligator belongs to America, where it is distributed extensively both in North and South America.  In the Spanish parts it is called `caiman,' and there are two species well-known, viz the spectacled caiman of Guiana, and the alligator of the Mississippi. No doubt, when the great rivers of South America have been properly explored, it will come to light, that there are other varieties than these.  I have heard of a species that inhabits the Lake Valencia in Venezuela, and which differs from both the American species mentioned. It is smaller than either, and is much sought after by the Indians for its flesh, which these people eat, and of which they are particularly fond.  It is probable, too, that new species of crocodiles may yet be found in Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean.  \"Now I think it is a well-ascertained fact, that all these varieties of the crocodile family have pretty much the same habits,--differing only where such difference might be expected by reason of climate, food, or other circumstances.  What I shall tell you of the alligator, then, will apply in a general way to all his scaly cousins.  You know his colour,-- dusky-brown above, and dirty yellowish-white underneath.  You know that he is covered all over with scales, and you see that on his back these scales rise into protuberances like little pyramids, and that a row of them along the upper edge of his tail give it a notched, saw-like appearance.  You notice that the tail is flattened vertically, and not like the tail of the beaver, which is compressed horizontally.  You observe that the legs are short and very muscular--that there are five toes on the fore-feet, slightly webbed or palmated, and four on the hind-feet much longer and much more webbed.  You notice that his head is somewhat like that of a pike, that the nostrils are near the end of the snout, the eyes prominent, and the opening of the ears just behind them. His eyes have dark pupils, with a lemon-coloured iris; and the pupils are not round, as in the eye of a man, but of an oval shape, something like those of a goat.  \"All these things you may observe by looking at an alligator.  But there are some things about the structure of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21236"],["title","The Boy Hunters (#8)"],["body","which are peculiar, and which may not strike you so readily.  You observe that his jaws open far back--even beyond the ears--where they are hinged or articulated into each other.  Now this is a peculiar formation, and the effect is, that when the alligator opens his mouth, his neck becomes somewhat bent upwards, giving him the appearance of having moved the upper instead of the under jaw.\"  \"Why I have often heard that that was so,\" remarked Francois.  \"Many have thought so, and said so, since the time of Herodotus, who first propagated this absurd idea.  It is not the fact, however.  It is the lower jaw that moves, as in other vertebrated animals; but the appearance I have described leads to the mistake that has been made by careless observers.  There is another point worth speaking of.  The opening of the alligator's ear is guarded by a pair of lips, which he closes the moment he goes under water.  His nostrils, too, are protected by valves, which he can also close at will.  There is also a peculiarity about his vertebrae.  These are so jointed to each other, that he cannot turn without describing a circle with his body.  He can move his head but slightly to one side or the other; and this is a fortunate circumstance, if not for him, at least for his enemies.  Were he able to turn short round, or twist himself about, as serpents do, he would be a most dangerous creature to encounter.  As it is, the great length of his body, combined with the shortness of his legs and the impossibility of his getting round quickly, renders him an easy antagonist on land, provided you keep out of reach of his great jaws, and beyond the sweep of his powerful tail.  This last is his true weapon of offence or defence; and as _it_ is not restrained by any vertebrae, he can use it with such effect as to knock the breath out of a man with one single flap.  Many of the habits of the alligator are known to you.  How the female lays eggs as big as those of a goose, and buries them in the sand, where they are hatched by the heat of the sun.  Sometimes she cannot find a sandbank to suit her purpose.  She then raises a circular platform of mud mixed with grass and sticks.  Upon this she deposits a layer of eggs, and covers them over with several inches of mud and grass.  She then lays a fresh tier of eggs, covering these also with mud, and so on until she has laid her whole hatching, which often amounts to nearly two hundred eggs, of a dirty greenish-white colour. In the end she covers all up with mud, plastering it with her tail until it assumes the appearance of a mud oven or beaver-house.  All these pains she takes to protect her eggs from raccoons and turtles, as well as vultures and other birds, that are very fond of them.  She haunts near the spot while the eggs are hatching, so as to keep off these enemies.  When the young are out, her first care is to get them to the water out of the way of such dangers.  This seems to be their first instinct, too; for no sooner are they free from the shell than they are seen scuttling off in that direction, or following their mother, many of them having climbed upon her back and shoulders.\"  \"But, brother,\" interrupted Francois, \"is it true that the old males eat their own young?\"  \"Horrible though it be, it is perfectly true, Francois.  I myself have seen it.\"  \"And I,\" said Basil, \"several times.\"  \"The first care of the mother is to get them to the water, where she can better conceal them from their unnatural parent; but, notwithstanding all her precautions, many of them fall victims, both to the old alligators, and the larger tortoises, and birds.  As soon as the young ones have learned a little sense, if I may so speak, they elude their monster fathers and uncles, as they are nimbler in their movements, and can keep out of reach of their great jaws and tails.  I have often seen the small alligators riding upon the backs of the larger ones, knowing that the latter could not reach them in that situation.\"  \"They appear to eat anything that comes in their way,\" remarked Francois.  \"They are not very particular as to that.  Fish is their favourite food, I believe, but they will eat any land animal they can kill; and it is believed they prefer it in a state of putrefaction.  That is a doubtful point.  They have been known to kill large animals in the water, and leave them at the bottom for several days; but this may have happened because they were not hungry at the time, and were merely keeping them until they should get an appetite.  The process of digestion with them, as with all reptiles, is very slow; hence they do not require such quantities of food as the warm-blooded animals--mammals and birds.  For instance, they bury themselves in the mud, and lie asleep during the whole winter without any food.\"  \"You say fish is their favourite food, Luce,\" said Basil; \"now I think they are fonder of dogs than anything else.  I have often known them to come where they had heard the yelping of a dog as if for the purpose of devouring it.  I have seen one seize a large dog that was swimming across the Bayou Boeuf, and drag him under, as quick as a trout would have taken a fly.  The dog was never seen again.\"  \"It is very true,\" replied Lucien, \"that they will eat dogs, as they will any other animals; but their being particularly fond of them is a point about which naturalists differ.  It is true they will approach the spot where they hear the yelping of a dog; but some say that this is because it so much resembles the whining of their own young, and that it is these they are in search of.\"  \"But I have seen both the males and females make towards the dog.\"  \"Just so.  The males went to devour the young, as they thought, and the females followed to protect them.  Great battles are often fought between the males and females on this account.\"  \"But how is it, Luce,\" inquired Francois, \"how is it they can catch fish that appear so much swifter than themselves?\"  \"Very few kinds of fish are swifter.  The alligator, by means of his webbed feet, and particularly his flat tail--which acts on the principle of a stern-oar to a boat, and a rudder as well--can pass through the water as swiftly as most of the finny tribe.  It is not by hunting it down, however, but by stratagem, that the alligator secures a fish for his maw.\"  \"By what stratagem?\"  \"You have often noticed them floating on the surface of the water, bent into a sort of semicircular shape, and without moving either body or limb?\"  \"Yes--yes; I have noticed it many a time.\"  \"Well, if you could have looked under the water then, you would have seen a fish somewhere upon the convex side of the semicircle.  The fish would be at rest--no doubt, watching the surface for his own prey: such flies or beetles as might come along.  Thus occupied, he does not heed the great dusky mass that is gliding slowly towards him, and which presents no threatening appearance--for the head of the alligator is at this time turned away from his intended victim.  Although apparently asleep, the alligator knows what he is about well enough.  He floats silently on, until he has got the fish within sweep of his great tail, that is all the while bent like a bow; and then, taking sure aim, he strikes the unconscious prey a `slap' that kills it at once--sometimes throwing it directly into his jaws, and sometimes flinging it several feet out of the water!  \"When on land the alligator strikes his prey in a similar manner.  As he gives the blow, his head turns so as to meet the tail half-way--the whole body thus forming a semicircle.  Should the prey not be killed by the blow of the tail, it is flung right into the jaws of the monster, where it is sure to be despatched in a trice.\"  \"But, brother,\" inquired Basil, \"why do the alligators eat stones and such substances?  I have seen one that was opened, and his stomach was nearly quarter full of stones as big as my fist, and pieces of sticks and glass.  They looked as if they had been there a long time, for the sharp edges were worn off.  This I never could understand.\"  \"No wonder, for wiser naturalists than we do not know the reason of this.  Some think it is upon the same principle, and for the same reason, that birds and other creatures swallow gravel and earth--to assist the process of digestion.  Others have affirmed that it is for the purpose of distending the stomach, so as to enable the reptile to bear his long fast while torpid during the winter.  This latter reason I look upon as very absurd, and worthy only of the fabulous Buffon.  For my part, I believe that the rubbish usually found in the alligator's stomach is collected there by accident--swallowed, from time to time, by mistake, or along with his prey; for his organs of taste are far from being delicate, and he will devour anything that is flung into the water, even a glass bottle.  These substances, of course, remain in his stomach--perhaps accumulating there during his whole lifetime--and as, like most reptiles, his stomach being very strong, they do him little, if any, injury.  We must not judge of an alligator's stomach as we would that of a human being; nor, indeed, of any of his organs.  If our brain is seriously injured, we die; but an alligator's brain may be altogether removed, even in the most violent manner, and the animal will crawl off and live for days after.  Instances have been known of alligators having had their brains blown out by a shot, and yet for hours after they would give battle to any one who might approach them.  Their brain, like that of all reptiles, is exceedingly small--proving them lower in the scale of intelligence than birds and mammals.\"  \"But, Lucien, you tell us that the habits of the crocodile family are alike, or nearly so: how comes it that the African crocodiles are so much more fierce, as we have heard, often attacking and devouring the natives of Senegal and the Upper Nile?  Our alligators are not so.  It is true they"]]]
