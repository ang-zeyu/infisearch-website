Here appear traces of vegetation--some low trees and bushes, a view of the forest inward into the country, a few buildings outside the walls, a railway-station, a cemetery, an aqueduct, a small sluggish stream, marshes and stagnant pools.  In front of the city, built upon the coral reef, stands the celebrated fortress-castle of San Juan de Ulloa.  It is about one thousand yards out from the mole, and over one of its angles towers a lighthouse.  Its walls, with the reef on which it stands (Gallega), shelter the harbour of Vera Cruz--which, in fact, is only a roadstead--from the north winds. Under the lee of San Juan the ships of commerce lie at anchor.  There are but few of them at any time.  Another large fort (Concepcion) stands upon the beach at the northern angle of the city, and a third (Santiago) defends it towards the south. A circular bastion, with heavy pieces of ordnance, sweeps the plain to the rear, commanding it as far as the sand-ridges.  Vera Cruz is a pretty picture to look at, either from the sea or from the sand-hills in the interior.  Its massive domes--its tall steeples and turreted roofs--its architecture, half Moorish, half modern--the absence of scattered suburbs or other salient objects to distract the eye--all combine to render the City of the True Cross an unique and striking picture.  In fact, its numerous architectural varieties, bound as they are into compact unity by a wall of dark lava-stone, impress you with the idea that some artist had arranged them for the sake of effect. The _coup d'oeil_ often reminded me of the engravings of cities in _Goldsmith's Epitome_, that used to be considered the bright spots in my lessons of school geography.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  At break of day, on the 10th, the army took up its line of march through hills of sand-drift.  Division lapped upon division, regiment upon regiment, extending the circle of investment by an irregular echelon. Foot rifles and light infantry drove the enemy from ridge to ridge, and through the dark mazes of the chaparral gorge.  The column continued its tortuous track, winding through deep denies, and over hot white hills, like a bristling snake.  It moved within range of the guns of the city, screened by intervening heights.  Now and then the loud cannon of Santiago opened upon it, as some regiment displayed itself, crossing a defile or pushing over the spur of a sand-hill.  The constant rattling of rifles and musketry told that our skirmishers were busy in the advance.  The arsenal was carried by a brilliant charge, and the American flag waved over the ruins of the Convent Malibran.  On the 11th the Orizava road was crossed, and the light troops of the enemy were brushed from the neighbouring hills.  They retired sullenly under shelter of their heavy guns, and within the walls of the city.  On the morning of the 12th the investment was complete.  Vera Cruz lay within a semicircle, around its centre.  The half circumference was a chain of hostile regiments that embraced the city in their concave arc. The right of this chain pitched its tents opposite the isle of Sacrificios; while five miles off to the north, its left rested upon the hamlet Vergara.  The sea covered the complement of this circle, guarded by a fleet of dark and warlike ships.  The diameter hourly grew shorter.  The lines of circum-vallation lapped closer and closer around the devoted city, until the American pickets appeared along the ridges of the nearest hills, and within range of the guns of Santiago, Concepcion, and Xjuoa.  A smooth sand-plain, only a mile in width, lay between the besiegers and the walls of the besieged.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  After tattoo-beat on the night of the 12th, with a party of my brother officers, I ascended the high hill around which winds the road leading to Orizava.  This hill overlooks the city of Vera Cruz.  After dragging ourselves wearily through the soft, yielding sand, we reached the summit, and halted on a projecting ridge.  With the exception of a variety of exclamations expressing surprise and delight, not a word for awhile was uttered by any of our party, each individual being wrapped up in the contemplation of a scene of surpassing interest.  It was moonlight, and sufficiently clear to distinguish the minutest objects on the picture that lay rolled out before us like a map.  Below our position, and seeming almost within reach of the hand, lay the City of the True Cross, rising out of the white plain, and outlined upon the blue background of the sea.  The dark grey towers and painted domes, the Gothic turret and Moorish minaret, impressed us with the idea of the antique; while here and there the tamarind, nourished on some azotea, or the fringed fronds of the palm-tree, drooping over the notched parapet, lent to the city an aspect at once southern and picturesque.  Domes, spires, and cupolas rose over the old grey walls, crowned with floating banners--the consular flags of France, and Spain, and Britain, waving alongside the eagle of the Aztecs.  Beyond, the blue waters of the Gulf rippled lightly against the sea-washed battlements of San Juan, whose brilliant lights glistened along the combing of the surf.  To the south we could distinguish the isle of Sacrificios, and the dark hulls that slept silently under the shelter of its coral reef.  Outside the fortified wall, which girt the city with its cincture of grey rock, a smooth plain stretched rearward to the foot of the hill on which we stood, and right and left along the crest of the ridge from Punta Hornos to Vergara, ranged a line of dark forms--the picket sentries of the American outposts, as they stood knee-deep in the soft, yielding sand-drift.  It was a picture of surprising interest; and, as we stood gazing upon it, the moon suddenly disappeared behind a bank of clouds; and the lamps of the city, heretofore eclipsed by her brighter beam, now burned up and glistened along the walls.  Bells rang merrily from church-towers, and bugles sounded through the echoing streets.  At intervals we could hear the shrill cries of the guard, \"_Centinela! alerte_!\"  (Sentinel, look out), and the sharp challenge, \"_Quien viva_?\"  (Who goes there?)  Then the sound of sweet music, mingled with the soft voices of women, was wafted to our ears, and with beating hearts we fancied we could hear the light tread of silken feet, as they brushed over the polished floor of the ball-room.  It was a tantalising moment, and wistful glances were cast on the beleaguered town; while more than one of our party was heard impatiently muttering a wish that it might be carried by assault.  As we continued gazing, a bright jet of flame shot out horizontally from the parapet over Puerto Nuevo.  \"Look out!\" cried Twing, at the same instant flinging his wiry little carcase squat under the brow of a sand-wreath.  Several of the party followed his example; but, before all had housed themselves, a shot came singing past, along with the loud report of a twenty-four.  The shot struck the comb of the ridge, within several yards of the group, and ricocheted off into the distant hills.  \"Try it again!\" cried one.  \"That fellow has lost a champagne supper,\" said Twing.  \"More likely he has had it, or his aim would be more steady,\" suggested an officer.  \"Oysters, too--only think of it!\" said Clayley.  \"Howld your tongue, Clayley, or by my sowl I'll charge down upon the town!\"  This came from Hennessy, upon whose imagination the contrast between champagne and oysters and the gritty pork and biscuit he had been feeding upon for several days past acted like a shock.  \"There again!\" cried Twing, whose quick eye caught the blaze upon the parapet.  \"A shell, by the powers!\" exclaimed Hennessy.  \"Let it dhrop first, or it may dhrop on ye,\" he continued, as several officers were about to fling themselves on their faces.  The bomb shot up with a hissing, hurtling sound.  A little spark could be seen as it traced its graceful curves through the dark heavens.  The report echoed from the walls, and at the same instant was heard a dull sound, as the shell buried itself in the sand-drift.  It fell close to one of the picket sentinels, who was standing upon his post within a few paces of the group.  The man appeared to be either asleep or stupefied, as he remained stock-still.  Perhaps he had mistaken it for the ricochet of a round shot.  \"It's big shooting for them to hit the hill!\" exclaimed a young officer.  The words had scarcely passed when a loud crash, like the bursting of a cannon, was heard under our feet; the ground opened like an earthquake, and, amidst the whistling of the fragments, the sand was dashed into our faces.  A cloud of dust hung for a moment above the spot.  The moon at this instant reappeared, and as the dust slowly settled away, the mutilated body of the soldier was seen upon the brow of the hill, at the distance of twenty paces from his post.  A low cheer reached us from Concepcion, the fort whence the shell had been projected.  Chagrined at the occurrence, and mortified that it had been caused by our imprudence, we were turning to leave the hill, when the \"whish\" of a rocket attracted our attention.  It rose from the chaparral, about a quarter of a mile in rear of the camp, and, before it had reached its culminating point, an answering signal shot up from the Puerto Nuevo.  At the same instant a horseman dashed out of the thicket, and headed his horse at the steep sand-hills.  After three or four desperate plunges, the fiery mustang gained the crest of the ridge upon which lay the remains of the dead soldier.  Here the rider, seeing our party, suddenly reined up and balanced for a moment in the stirrup, as if uncertain whether to advance or retreat.  We, on the other hand, taking him for some officer of our own, and wondering who it could be galloping about at such an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21242"],["title","On the Irrawaddy: A Story of the First Burmese War (#0)"],["body","The Irrawaddy: A Story of the First Burmese War By G.

With the exception of the terrible retreat from Afghanistan, none of England's many little wars have been so fatal--in proportion to the number of those engaged--as our first expedition to Burma. It was undertaken without any due comprehension of the difficulties to be encountered, from the effects of climate and the deficiency of transport; the power, and still more the obstinacy and arrogance of the court of Ava were altogether underrated; and it was considered that our possession of her ports would assuredly bring the enemy, who had wantonly forced the struggle upon us, to submission. Events, however, proved the completeness of the error. The Burman policy of carrying off every boat on the river, laying waste the whole country, and driving away the inhabitants and the herds, maintained our army as prisoners in Rangoon through the first wet season; and caused the loss of half the white officers and men first sent there. The subsequent campaign was no less fatal and, although large reinforcements had been sent, fifty percent of the whole died; so that less than two thousand fighting men remained in the ranks, when the expedition arrived within a short distance of Ava. Not until the last Burmese army had been scattered did the court of Ava submit to the by no means onerous terms we imposed.  Great, indeed, was the contrast presented by this first invasion of the country with the last war in 1885, which brought about the final annexation of Burma. Then a fleet of steamers conveyed the troops up the noble river; while in 1824 a solitary steamer was all that India could furnish, to aid the flotilla of rowboats. No worse government has ever existed than that of Burma when, with the boast that she intended to drive the British out of India, she began the war. No people were ever kept down by a more grinding tyranny, and the occupation of the country by the British has been an even greater blessing to the population than has that of India.  Several works, some by eyewitnesses, others compiled from official documents, appeared after the war. They differ remarkably in the relation of details, and still more in the spelling of the names both of persons and places. I have chiefly followed those given in the narratives of Mr. H. H. Wilson, and of Major Snodgrass, the military secretary to the commander of the expedition.    Chapter 1: A New Career.   A party was assembled in a room of an hotel in Calcutta, at the end of the year 1822. It consisted of a gentleman, a lady in deep mourning, a boy of between fourteen and fifteen, and two girls of thirteen and twelve.  \"I think you had better accept my offer, Nellie,\" the gentleman was saying. \"You will find it hard work enough to make both ends meet, with these two girls; and Stanley would be a heavy drain on you. The girls cost nothing but their clothes; but he must go to a decent school, and then there would be the trouble of thinking what to do with him, afterwards. If I could have allowed you a couple of hundred a year, it would have been altogether different; but you see I am fighting an uphill fight, myself, and need every penny that I can scrape together. I am getting on; and I can see well enough that, unless something occurs to upset the whole thing, I shall be doing a big trade, one of these days; but every half penny of profit has to go into the business. So, as you know, I cannot help you at present though, by the time the girls grow up, I hope I shall be able to do so, and that to a good extent.  \"I feel sure that it would not be a bad thing for Stanley. He will soon get to be useful to me, and in three or four years will be a valuable assistant. Speaking Hindustani as well as he does, he won't be very long in picking up enough of the various dialects in Kathee and Chittagong for our purpose and, by twenty, he will have a share of the business, and be on the highway towards making his fortune. It will be infinitely better than anything he is likely to find in England, and he will be doing a man's work at the age when he would still be a schoolboy in England.  \"I have spoken to him about it. Of course, he does not like leaving you, but he says that he should like it a thousand times better than, perhaps, having to go into some humdrum office in England.\"  \"Thank you, Tom,\" Mrs. Brooke said with a sigh. \"It will be very hard to part with him--terribly hard--but I see that it is by far the best thing for him and, as you say, in a monetary way it will be a relief to me. I think I can manage very comfortably on the pension, in some quiet place at home, with the two girls; but Stanley's schooling would be a heavy drain. I might even manage that, for I might earn a little money by painting; but there would be the question of what to do with him when he left school and, without friends or influence, it will be hopeless to get him into any good situation.  \"You see, Herbert's parents have both died since he came out here and, though he was distantly related to the Earl of Netherly, he was only a second cousin, or something of that kind, and knew nothing about the family; and of course I could not apply to them.\"  \"Certainly not, Nellie,\" her brother agreed. \"There is nothing so hateful as posing as a poor relation--and that is a connection rather than a relationship. Then you will leave the boy in my hands?\"  \"I am sure that it will be best,\" she said, with a tremor in her voice, \"and at any rate, I shall have the comfort of knowing that he will be well looked after.\"  Mrs. Brooke was the widow of a captain in one of the native regiments of the East India Company. He had, six weeks before this, been carried off suddenly by an outbreak of cholera; and she had been waiting at Calcutta, in order to see her brother, before sailing for England. She was the daughter of an English clergyman, who had died some seventeen years before. Nellie, who was then eighteen, being motherless as well as fatherless, had determined to sail for India. A great friend of hers had married and gone out, a year before. Nellie's father was at that time in bad health; and her friend had said to her, at parting:  \"Now mind, Nellie, I have your promise that, if you should find yourself alone here, you will come out to me in India. I shall be very glad to have you with me, and I don't suppose you will be on my hands very long; pretty girls don't remain single many months, in India.\"  So, seeing nothing better to do, Nellie had, shortly after her father's death, sailed for Calcutta.  Lieutenant Brooke was also a passenger on board the Ava, and during the long voyage he and Nellie Pearson became engaged; and were married, from her friend's house, a fortnight after their arrival. Nellie was told that she was a foolish girl, for that she ought to have done better; but she was perfectly happy. The pay and allowances of her husband were sufficient for them to live upon in comfort; and though, when the children came, there was little to spare, the addition of pay when he gained the rank of captain was ample for their wants. They had been, in fact, a perfectly happy couple--both had bright and sunny dispositions, and made the best of everything; and she had never had a serious care, until he was suddenly taken away from her.  Stanley had inherited his parents' disposition and, as his sisters, coming so soon after him, occupied the greater portion of his mother's care, he was left a good deal to his own devices; and became a general pet in the regiment, and was equally at home in the men's lines and in the officers' bungalows. The native language came as readily to him as English and, by the time he was ten, he could talk in their own tongue with the men from the three or four different districts from which the regiment had been recruited. His father devoted a couple of hours a day to his studies. He did not attempt to teach him Latin--which would, he thought, be altogether useless to him--but gave him a thorough grounding in English and Indian history, and arithmetic, and insisted upon his spending a certain time each day in reading standard English authors.  Tom Pearson, who was five years younger than his sister, had come out to India four years after her. He was a lad full of life and energy. As soon as he left school, finding himself the master of a hundred pounds--the last remains of the small sum that his father had left behind him--he took a second-class passage to Calcutta. As soon as he had landed, he went round to the various merchants and offices and, finding that he could not, owing to a want of references, obtain a clerkship, he took a place in the store of a Parsee merchant who dealt in English goods. Here he remained for five years, by which time he had mastered two or three native languages, and had obtained a good knowledge of business.  He now determined to start on his"]]]
