And this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leather-bottomed arm-chairs.        The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of       the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its       faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There       is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of       Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When       the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and       responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond       of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.        All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.       His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his       eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other       old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only       double, but triple.        I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:       alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!        There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that       “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It       wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when       there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted       universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple.        By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great       rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark       snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide       mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What       with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed       black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black       stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge       _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from       which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of       fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a       sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!        To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an       audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right       into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a       fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps.        The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to       get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a       minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the       midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and       then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged       himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town       Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at       once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big       _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it       so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so       fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the       devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       Vondervotteimittiss.        There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.       The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and       pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded.        “One!” said the clock.        “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every       leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said       his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”       said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig.        “Two!” continued the big bell; and        “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.        “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.        “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the       others.        “Eleven!” said the big one.        “Eleben!” assented the little ones.        “Twelve!” said the bell.        “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their       voices.        “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up       their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.        “Thirteen!” said he.        “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,       dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees.        “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is       Dirteen o’clock!!”        Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All       Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of       uproar.        “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been       ongry for dis hour!”        “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has       been done to rags for this hour!”        “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,       “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and       they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in       their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.        Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it       seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the       mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.       But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,       scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and       caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and       running under the petticoats of the people, and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters       still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost.

There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was       lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the       bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On       his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all       time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the       nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”        Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in       disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore       the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple.     LIONIZING        —— all people went      Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.                     —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.        I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the       author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,       is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of       Fum-Fudge.        The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I       mastered before I was breeched.        I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to       understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a       Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.       Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams.        When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step       with him into his study.        “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of       your existence?”        “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”        “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”        “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”        “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a       nose?”        “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I       pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To       commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that       protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”        “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am       thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am       positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his       hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]       “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time       you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing       than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me       downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God       bless you!”        As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it       a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology       forthwith.        All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.        “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.        “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.        “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.        “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.        “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.        “Great man!” said Bentley.        “Divine soul!” said Fraser.        “One of us!” said Blackwood.        “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.        “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.        “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these       people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an       artist.        The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the       Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of       This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness       of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.        I approached the artist and turned up my nose.        “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.        “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.        “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.        “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.        “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.        “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.        “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.        “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.        “I do,” said I, blowing it well.        “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.        “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.        “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a       microscope.        “None,” said I, turning it up.        “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the       beauty of the manœuvre.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Precisely,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Just so,” said I.        “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he       drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I       engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the       ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the       proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me       to dinner.        We were all lions and _recherchés_.        There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,       Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.        There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,       Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill       Health.”        There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were       philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.        There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;       bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive       intelligence and homoömeria.        There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;       heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;       Homousios and Homouioisios.        There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned       Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à       la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange       jellies _en mosaïques_.        There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and       Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.       George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and       Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.       Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his       eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.        There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of       Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of       Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of       the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.        There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of       opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in       Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.        There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking       that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in       the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth       was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of       green horns.        There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the       eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four       orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches       of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;       of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of       Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty       tragedies of Homer Junior.        There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all       about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,       fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist       and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about       blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about       cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about       antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.        There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of       myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up       my nose, and I spoke of myself.        “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.        “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of       Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.        “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me       under the chin.        “Upon honor,” said I.        “Nose and all?” she asked.        “As I live,” I replied.        “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”        “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”        “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”        “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,       and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to       suffocation.        “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther up. "]]]
