Resuming their work on the instant, they tried to bring the weapons to a keen point.  \"Kill lion,\" said Coffee, laconically; and he worked away as if the lion were round the corner waiting to be killed.  \"Then ye may just as well lave off, ye dirty little naygars; for it's my belafe that you're not going at all.\"  Dinny went off into the house leaving the two boys apparently paralysed. They dropped the assegais, stared at each other, and then lay down and howled in the misery of their disappointment.  But this did not last many seconds; for Coffee sprang up and kicked Chicory, who also rose to his feet, and in obedience to a word from his brother they took their assegais and hid them in a tree which formed their armoury--for out of its branches Chicory took the two kiris or clubs; and then the boys ran round to the front, and stood making signs.  The brothers had such a keen love of anything in the way of sport that, expecting something new, they ran out and willingly followed the two young blacks out into the grassy plain about a mile from the house, when after posting their young masters behind a bush, Coffee and Chicory whispered to them to watch, and then began to advance cautiously through the grass, kiri in hand, their eyes glistening as they keenly peered from side to side.  \"What are they going to do?\" said Dick.  \"I don't know.  Show us something.  I wish we had brought our guns. Look out!\"  There was a whirring of wings, and the two Zulu boys struck attitudes that would have been models for a sculptor; then as a large bird similar to a partridge rose up, Coffee sent his knobbed club whizzing through the air; another bird rose, and Chicory imitated his brother's act; and the result was, that the cleverly thrown kiris hit the birds, which fell in amongst the long grass, from which they were retrieved by the lads with shouts of triumph--the birds proving to be the coranne, so called from the peculiarity of their cry.  \"Well done, boys!\" cried Jack.  \"They'll be good eating.\"  \"Boss Dick, Boss Jack take Zulu boys, now?\" said the kiri-throwers, eagerly.  \"Why, of course.  You know you are going,\" replied Dick.  \"Dinny say Zulu boys not going,\" cried Chicory.  \"Then Dinny knows nothing about it,\" said Dick, angrily.  \"If he don't mind he'll be left behind himself.\"  Coffee sent his kiri spinning up in the air, Chicory followed suit, each catching the weapon again with ease; and then they both dashed off across the plain as if mad, and to the astonishment of the brothers, who took the brace of birds and walked back towards the house, to continue the preparations for the start.  For there was so much to do, packing the great long tilted waggon with necessaries, in the shape of tea, sugar, coffee, and chocolate.  Barrels of mealies or Indian corn, and wheaten flour, besides.  Salt too, had to be taken, and a large store of ammunition; for in addition to boxes well filled with cartridges, they took a keg or two of powder and a quantity of lead.  Then there were rolls of brass wire, and a quantity of showy beads--the latter commodities to take the place of money in exchanges with the natives--salt, powder, and lead answering the same purpose.  It was a delightful task to the boys, who thoroughly enjoyed the packing, and eagerly asked what every package contained, when they had no opportunity of opening it; while Mr Rogers looked on, smiling at the interest they took.  \"Here y'are, young gentlemen,\" said Dinny.  \"The masther seems to think that you're going to do nothing but suck sweet-stuff all the time you're out.\"  \"Why, what's that, Dinny?\" cried Dick, who had just brought out a heavy box.  \"Sure, it's sugar-shticks and candy,\" said Dinny; and he went off to fetch something else.  \"Why, so it is, Dick,\" said Jack.  \"I say, father, are we to pack this sweet-stuff in the waggon?  We don't want it.\"  \"Indeed, but we do,\" said his father, coming up.  \"Why a handful of sweet-stuff will make friends with a Boer, when everything else fails. Here, put this in the fore box.  Perhaps, when I bring this out you'll be glad to get at the sweet-stuff.\"  \"What is it, father?\" said Dick.  Mr Rogers opened the little deal case and turned it out, to begin packing it again.  \"Here's a bottle of chloroform, and another of castor oil; two bottles of chlorodyne; a pound of Epsom salts; four large boxes of pills; a roll of sticking-plaster; a pot of zinc ointment; and a bottle of quinine and one of rhubarb and magnesia.\"  Jack's countenance was a study.  For as his father carefully repacked the little box the lad's face grew into a hideous grimace.  He waited till Mr Rogers had finished his enumeration, and then clapping his handkerchief over his mouth, he uttered a loud \"Ugh!\" and ran and stood a few yards away.  \"I shan't go,\" he cried.  \"Why not?\" said Mr Rogers, smiling.  \"Why the waggon will smell, of nothing but physic.  What's the good of taking it, father?\"  \"The good?  Well, my boy, there's nothing like being prepared; and we are going far away from doctors, if we wanted their help.  We may none of us be unwell, but it is quite likely that we may, either of us, get a touch of fever.  Besides, we might meet with an accident; and for my part, as I have a little knowledge of medicine and surgery, I know nothing more painful than to find people sick and to be unable to give them the remedy that would make them well.  We shall be sure to find some sick people amongst the natives, and they have a wonderful appreciation of the white man's medicine.\"  \"Well, look here,\" said Jack, \"if you'll shut the box up very tightly, I'll consent to come.\"  Mr Rogers smiled, and did shut the little box up very tightly, after which the preparations went on; and it was perfectly wonderful to see what that waggon would hold.  There was a moderate case of wines and spirits, also to act as medicines; several dozens of coloured blankets for presents; waterproof sheets.  A cask of paraffin oil was swung under the floor, and by it a little cooking-stove, while beside these swung a long box containing spades and shovels, for digging the waggon-wheels out of holes, tools for repairs, wrenches, and jacks and axes, till it seemed as if there would be no end to the stores and material.  Then leather slings were nailed up under the tilt for the rifles and guns, so that they might always be ready to hand; for they were going into the land of wild beasts and savage men.  Above all, their stores had to be so packed that their positions could be remembered, and they could be obtained when wanted, and yet leave space for blankets to be spread, and the travellers find room to sleep beneath the tilt upon the top.  The preparations went on; the black driver who was to manage the oxen busied himself along with the foreloper, whose duty it is to walk with the foremost oxen, in getting their great whips in trim, and in seeing the trek-tow and dissel-boom--as the great trace and pole of the waggon are called--were perfect; and they practised the team as well.  Many of the readers may not know that for an expedition like this, where the waggon party expect to be travelling for months, perhaps for a year, through a country where roads are almost unknown, and where the great heavily-laden, but wonderfully strongly-made waggon, has to be dragged over rocks, through swamps, and into and out of rivers, a team of fourteen, sixteen, or, as in this case, even twenty oxen, will be yoked to the great chain or rope called the trek-tow.  For some of the poor animals are sure to succumb during the journey; or they may be killed for food, the loss being not so much felt when a superabundant number is taken.  With the leading pair of oxen walks the foreloper, whose duty it is to choose the best road, and to avoid stones and marshy places where the wheels would sink in; and the success of an expedition depends a good deal upon having a good foreloper.  In this case Mr Rogers had secured a trusty Kaffir, who had been frequently into the interior; but his appearance was against him, for he had lost one eye, from a thrust of a bullock's horn.  But Dinny said that the one left was as good as two, for when Dirk looked at you, it seemed to go right through your head and tickle the hair behind.  Off to the Wilds--by George Manville Fenn    CHAPTER FOUR.  INSPANNING FOR THE TRIP.  The eventful morning at last!  Bright, clear, and the dew lying thick upon the thirsty earth.  All the arrangements had been made; the waggon stood ready.  Peter the driver was upon the box in front of the waggon; the boys were mounted, and a couple of neighbours had ridden over to see them start; but to the infinite vexation of Dick and Jack, the young Zulus had not returned.  They had started off on the day when they killed the coranne, and that was the last that had been seen of them.  \"Now, Dinny, you may let the dogs loose,\" cried Dick, who looked brighter and better, his father thought, than he had been for days. Dinny at once obeyed; when, yelping and barking with delight, the four dogs--Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and Rough'un--came bounding about, leaping up at their masters, and taking short dashes out into the plain and back.  \"Where are those two boys?\" said Mr Rogers suddenly.  \"I haven't seen them for days.\"  \"Dinny offended them,\" said Jack petulantly, as he patted the arched neck of Stockings.  \"He told them they shouldn't go.\"  \"Sure I only hinted to the black young gintlemen that it was just possible the masther might lave them behind, when they took themselves off in the most ondacent way; and that's all I know, sor.\"  \"Here they are!\" cried Jack suddenly, \"Hi-yi-yi-yi--Coff!  Hi-yi-yi-yi-- Chick!\"  \"Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi!\" echoed back; and the two boys came running up, one on either side of a fierce-looking, very powerfully-built Zulu--a handful of assegais, and his long, narrow, oval shield in one hand, and for costume a fringe of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],["title","Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#4)"],["body","round the waist, a sort of tippet of the same over his back and chest, and smaller fringes just beneath each knee. His back hair was secured in a knot behind, and depending from it were some feathers, one of which drooped right down his back.  He was a noble-looking specimen of humanity, and as he came up he gazed almost haughtily round at the party, seeming as if he had come as an enemy, and not as a friend.  \"Been fetch de father,\" cried Coffee, pushing the great Zulu towards Mr Rogers.  \"Father going to boss.  Kill and hunt lion.\"  Mr Rogers raised his eyebrows a little, for he had not reckoned upon this; but one more or less on such an expedition did not matter, for plenty of provisions would be killed; and a man like this was no little addition to their strength.  \"Oh, very good,\" he said.  \"Dinny, run into the house, and fetch the bread and meat we left.  I daresay the boys are hungry.\"  Coffee and Chicory understood that, and they began to grin and rub their \"tum-tums,\" as they called a prominent part of their persons; but the next moment they had dragged their father to introduce him to Boss Dick and Boss Jack, smiling with delight on seeing their young masters shake hands with the Zulu warrior.  Dinny did not look at all pleasant as he brought out the bread and meat, which was rapidly shared by the Zulu and his boys, who evidently meant to eat the food as they went along; so after one more look round, and a glance at the two great water-casks swung behind the waggon, Mr Rogers gave the word, Peter the driver stood up on the great chest strapped in front, cracking his whip with both hands, and Dirk the foreloper followed suit.  \"Trek Hans!  Trek Buffler!  Trek Zulu!  Trek boys!  Trek!\" shouted Peter, dancing about on the chest in his excitement.  \"Trek, beauties!  Trek, beauties!  Trek!  Trek!  Trek!\" yelled Dirk.  The oxen slowly tugged at their yokes, the great trek-tow tightened, the wheels of the fine new waggon creaked; and as Mr Rogers mounted the big bay, his sons took off and waved their caps, giving a loud cheer, for now they were really off to the wilds.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A TASTE OF SOMETHING TO COME.  There was but little in the way of incident for some time.  The dogs seemed to be never weary of hunting here and there, thrusting their noses under every rock, their heads into every hole; but they found nothing till after the midday halt, when a furious barking from the setter Rough'un took the attention of all, and Mr Rogers and the boys cantered up to a thin cluster of trees, where, on what seemed to be at first a broken stump, but which on nearer inspection proved to be a tall ragged ant-hill, a vicious-looking snake was curled, swinging its head about threateningly, and darting out its forked tongue at the dog, which kept its distance, barking furiously.  \"A poisonous fellow--cobra evidently.  Now, Dick, bring it down.\"  \"No; let Jack shoot, father,\" said Dick.  \"My head aches, and I'm tired. Well, yes, I will.\"  \"That's right, my boy.  I want you to master this weakness,\" said his father.  \"And besides, I want you to try how your horse stands fire. Nip him tightly with your knees.\"  Dick cocked his double-barrelled breechloader--fired--and the serpent hissed loudly and began to descend, but a shot from Jack's rifle laid it writhing on the ground, when, before it could be prevented, Rough'un seized it behind the head, worrying it furiously.  Fortunately the creature was mortally wounded, or it might have gone hard with one of the dogs, its poison being very violent; and the others coming up soon tore it to pieces.  \"Your horses behaved admirably,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"You must train them, my boys, so that they will stand where you leave them, and take no more notice of a shot fired over their heads than at a distance.\"  They halted directly after for a midday meal, the oxen finding a plentiful supply of fresh grass and water, and after a good rest they were once more on the way, the horses behind under the care of Dinny and the Zulu warrior.  Mr Rogers and his sons were close to the oxen, Coffee and Chicory were close behind, and they were inspecting the team, which was pulling steadily and well, when Mr Rogers said,--  \"Well, boys, we may as well get our guns.  We shall soon be in the hunting country now.\"  \"Hi!  Yup-yup-yup!\" shouted Coffee.  \"Ho!  Yup-yup-yup!\" yelled Chicory.  The dogs began to yelp and bark; and in the excitement, as they saw an animal like a great long-eared spotted cat dash out of a clump of trees and make for some rocky ground, all joined in the chase; Mr Rogers ran as hard as the rest, forcing his pith hunting-helmet down over his head.  Coffee got well in front, waving his arms and shouting; but Chicory trod upon a thorn and began to limp.  As for Jack, in his excitement he tripped over a stump, and fell sprawling; while Dick had hard work to save himself from a similar mishap.  Last of all, whip in hand, came the foreloper, who had left the oxen in his excitement, flourishing and cracking his lash.  There was a sharp hunt for a few minutes, during which the followers toiled on over the rocky ground, seeing nothing after their first glimpse of the lynx--for such Mr Rogers declared it to be; then they met the dogs coming back, looking very stupid, and quite at fault.  Rough'un, however, went on with Coffee, and Jack followed, to find that the lynx had evidently gone down a deep rift, where it was impossible to follow it; so they went back to the waggons, both Jack and his father determining that in future they would never be without either gun or rifle in hand.  Every minute, almost, as they journeyed on, the boys realised the value of having the waggon made in the best manner, and of the strongest wood that could be obtained, for it bumped and swayed about, creaking dismally beneath its heavy load, and making the casks and pots slung beneath clatter together every now and then, as it went over some larger stone than usual.  They saw too the value of a good foreloper; for if a careless man were at the head of the oxen, the waggon might at any moment be wrecked over some rugged rock or sunk to the floor in a black patch of bog.  The dogs seemed rather ashamed of themselves after the chase of the lynx, and went with lolling tongues to trot behind the waggon, Pompey now and then making an angry snatch at Caesar, while Crassus threw up his muzzle and uttered a dismal yelp.  Rough'un, too, did not seem happy, but to have that lynx on his conscience; for he kept running out from beneath the waggon, and looking back as if bound to finish the chase by hunting the cat-like creature out; but he always altered his mind and went under the waggon once more, to walk close to the heels of the last pair of oxen, one of which looked back from time to time in a thoughtful meditative way, with its great soft eyes, as if in consideration whether it ought to kick out and send Rough'un flying.  This act made Rough'un run forward, and as the ox bent down snuffing at it, the dog leaped up at its muzzle, then at that of the next ox, and went on right along the whole span, saluting all in turn without getting trampled, and ending by retaking his place beneath the waggon front.  For Rough'un was a dog of a different breed to his fellows, and though he hunted with them he did not associate with them afterwards, but kept himself to himself.  There was not much to interest the boys after the first excitement of the start was over, for they had to travel over plain and mountain for some distance before they would reach ground that had not been well hunted over by the settlers; but every step took them nearer, and there were endless matters to canvass.  For instance, there were the capabilities of their horses, which grew in favour every time they were mounted; the excellences of their guns, presented to them by their father for the expedition, light handy pieces, double-barrelled breechloaders, the right-hand barrel being that of an ordinary shot-gun, the left-hand being a rifle sighted up to three hundred yards.  It would be hard to say how many times these guns were loaded and unloaded, slung across their owners' backs and taken down again, while the eagerness with which they looked forward to some good opening for trying their skill was notable.  But beyond an occasional bird which fled with a loud cry at the approach of the waggon, and a little herd of springbok seen upon the edge of a low hill quite a mile away, there was little to break the monotony of the journey over the hot sandy waste, and every one was pretty weary when, just at sundown, they came in sight of a low house, the abode of a Boer who had settled there some years before, and who, with his large family, seemed to be perfectly content, and who smiled with satisfaction on being presented with some sweets in return for his civility in pointing out the places where the out-spanned oxen could find an abundance of grass and water.  Here the first experience of sleeping in a waggon was gone through, and very comical it seemed to boys who were accustomed to the comforts of a well-regulated home.  Dick laughed, and said that it was like sleeping in the attic, while the servants slept in the kitchen, for the drivers and the three Zulus made themselves snug under the waggon, Dinny joining them very unwillingly, after a verbal encounter with Dick, who, however much he might be wanting in bodily strength, was pretty apt with his tongue.  \"Sure, Masther Dick, sir, Dinny's the last boy in the world to grumble; but I'm a good Christian, and the blacks are as haythen as can be.\"  \"Well, Dinny, and what of that?\"  \"Why, ye see, Masther Dick, I'm a white man, and they are all blacks; and,\" he added with a grin, \"I shouldn't like to catch the complaint.\"  \"What complaint, Dinny?\"  \"Why, sure, sir, it would be very painful to you and Masther Jack there, and the masther himself, if you found poor Dinny get up some fine morning as black as a "]]]
