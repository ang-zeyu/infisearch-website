Then that leaves less to tuck in at the bottom, and if you have a nightmare and kick, there you are with your feet sticking out in the cold, and have to get up and tuck them in, when you want to sleep!  And I can't endure creases.  I like the under sheet stretched as tight as tight.  Everyone likes a bed made in a special way, and it _ought_ to be done.  Think of the time one spends in bed!  A third of one's life. It's a shame not to be comfortable.  I should be an expert in bed- making.  I'd keep a book to remind me of everyone's special fancies--\"  \"And lose it the second day!  Play all the experiments you like, but leave my room alone.  I want no expert.  The ordinary common or garden housemaid is good enough for me,\" said Hereward, cruelly.  Dreda reflected sadly that a prophet was not a prophet in her own country, but she was too much fired with the new idea to relinquish it without a trial.  Besides, hidden in her heart lay the reviving thought: \"If I could prove that I could be of use in the house, perhaps they'd let me stay!  I know quite enough lessons as it is!\"  The first two nights after hearing of the changed arrangements for her own education Dreda had cried herself to sleep, and had even succeeded-- with a little difficulty--in squeezing out a few tears as she dressed in the morning, or what was the use of breaking your heart if no one were the wiser, or pitied you for your pathetic looks?  By the third morning, however, her facile nature had adapted itself to the inevitable.  She was tired of being in the dumps, and reflected that with a little diplomacy she would be able to \"manage\" the school governesses as cleverly as she had done the Spider before them, while the Currant Buns looked meek, poor-spirited creatures, who would like nothing better than to be ruled.  \"_I'll_ teach them!\" prophesied Dreda darkly, and the word was used in no educational sense.  The future was thus swallowed at a gulp; but all the same Dreda thought it worth while to interview her mother on the subject of her domestic ambitions, and was much disappointed to have her generous offer kindly but firmly refused.  \"There is no necessity, dear.  Thank you very much, all the same,\" Mrs Saxon said, smilingly.  \"We are no longer able to keep up two houses, but we can afford all the help that is needed for one.  The two housemaids can keep the bedrooms in order very easily in this fresh clean air.\"  Etheldreda put her head on one side and lengthened her upper lip, after a fashion she affected when she wished to be impressive.  \"_Still_,\" she insisted, obstinately, \"when a family is reduced in circumstances I think it _most_ important that the girls should learn to be domestic.  I have always understood that in reduced circumstances it was necessary for the mistress to overlook _everything_, and how can you learn to do that if you never begin?  It seems to me that one can never begin too young, and if we _could_ do with only one housemaid, it is our duty to do so.\"  Mrs Saxon laughed.  She always did laugh when Dreda waxed impressive, which was one of that young woman's trials in life.  \"Darling Dreda!\" she cried, affectionately.  \"You shall be as domestic as ever you please--the more domestic the better; but there is a time for everything, and this is your time for study.  You must wait until your education is finished, before you take up home duties.  We are not going to sacrifice your interests for the sake of a servant's wages. Work hard, and do your best, dear.  One thing at a time, and that done well--\"  But Dreda refused to be convinced.  \"_My_ theory,\" she announced, firmly, \"my theory is that it is stupid to waste time learning things which you will never need!  As we are `rejuiced' (the expression had stuck, until the very pronunciation was unconsciously reproduced), and I can't go to Madame Clerc's and be finished properly, I should consider that it would be wiser to stop as I am.  I am very well grounded.  We can't afford to go into society now, so I shall probably marry a man in a humble position, and it's foolish to educate me above my rank!\"  \"Oh, Dreda, Dreda!  Oh!  I haven't laughed for weeks.  You mustn't be vexed with me for laughing, dear--it's _so_ refreshing!\"  And Mrs Saxon wiped her eyes and chuckled irresistibly, the while her young daughter regarded her more in pity than in anger.  \"I can't see what I have said that is so amusing.  I was speaking _most_ seriously.  I'm fifteen.  It's my own future that is at stake.  Really, mother!\"  \"I'm sorry, dear, and I don't mean to be unsympathetic.  I know you are in earnest, but for the next few years you must consent to be guided by what father and I believe to be best.  Whatever may be before you, it is necessary that you have a good education, so put your heart into your work, and get on as quickly as possible.\"  Dreda sucked her upper lip in eloquent disgust.  \"Parents are so _trying_!\" she told herself, mentally.  \"They never seem to think it possible that you know better yourself.  I shall be quite different with my daughters.  What a pity it is that you can never manage to be your own mother!\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  During the next three weeks the Saxons settled slowly into the routine of life as it would in future be spent at the Manor.  To begin with, the house itself was greatly improved in appearance by the addition of extra furniture and draperies sent down from the lavishly equipped house in town.  The cold austerity of the entrance-hall was turned into something positively approaching cheerfulness by the presence of crimson portieres, a huge tapestry screen shutting off the staircase, and, best of all, by a brass brazier which, piled high with blazing coals, diffused both light and heat, and seemed to speak a cheery welcome to each new-comer.  The Bechstein grand piano was not only a gain from a musical point of view, but made a decided improvement in the sparsely furnished drawing-room, while a few good pictures and ornaments gave a homelike air which had hitherto been conspicuous by its absence.  Rowena regarded these improvements with the numb unconcern which a prisoner might manifest over an unimportant alteration in his cell; but Dreda, as usual, was afire with enthusiasm, and spent a radiantly happy day playing the part of a charwoman, in apron and rolled-up sleeves. She washed all the ornaments, exulting in the inky colour of the water after the operation, and insisting that each member of the household should ascend to regain the same.  \"Isn't it beautifully dirty?\" she cried in triumph.  \"I scrubbed them with the nail brush.  You should have seen the dust come out of the chinks!  I simply dote upon seeing the water turn black.  It's no fun washing things unless they are _really_ dirty!\"  When the additions were viewed as a whole, however, Dreda was not so content.  She even frowned with displeasure at sight of the luxury in the hall.  \"It's not consistent!\" she pronounced, judicially.  \"We are _rejuiced_, and it doesn't look rejuiced!  People in the neighbourhood coming to call will think we are richer instead of poorer.  You will have to explain, mother.  It wouldn't be honest if you didn't.\"  Mrs Saxon's smile was a somewhat painful effort.  \"I imagine there will be little need of explanation, Dreda.  News flies fast in a country place, and our neighbours probably know our affairs as well as we know them ourselves.\"  \"And are gossiping about us behind our backs, and longing to call and see how we bear it!\" continued Rowena, with that new edge of bitterness in her voice, which sounded so sadly in her mother's ears.  It needed a hard struggle with herself before Mrs Saxon could command herself to reply gently:  \"Curiosity is natural, perhaps, but I don't think we need fear anything unfriendly.  If there should be any exhibition of the sort, it's a comfort to feel that I can depend upon my grown-up daughter to set an example of dignity and self-restraint.  My nature is like Dreda's, so much more impulsive, that you will be a great strength to me, dear.\"  Oh, that soft answer that turneth away wrath, how omnipotent it is!  The sneer was wiped off Rowena's face as by a sponge, her blue eyes glistened, and she stooped her tall young head to press an impetuous kiss upon her mother's cheek.  For the rest of the day she was her old, sweet loving self, and the mother was rewarded a thousandfold for the effort which it had cost her to repress a hasty retort, and replace it by a word of tenderness and appreciation.  At the end of a fortnight the three boys returned to school, placidly resigned to a change of circumstances which left their own lives untouched; and no sooner had they departed than the Spider in her turn began to pack her boxes, in preparation for her own exit.  For the past ten years she had been regarded as a member of the family, spending the greater number of her holidays with her pupils, and being included in all the household festivities and rejoicings.  It was inevitable that her absence would cause a blank, and the young people experienced sundry pangs of conscience as they recalled the want of appreciation with which they had received their efforts on their behalf.  How they had teased and lazed, and plotted and schemed, to escape the tasks which she had so laboriously enforced!  How they had laughed behind her back, imitating her little mannerisms, and exhorting each other after her invariable formulae: \"Impertinence, my love, is _not_ wit!\"  \"A young lady should be composed and dignified in demeanour.\"  \"Concentration, my dear, concentration!  That is what you require.\" Poor, dear, good Spider; her methods were somewhat behind the times; but she was the kindest, most faithful of souls.  Everyone was thankful to know that owing to the recent receipt of a legacy she was able to retire comfortably from active work, and to look forward to a peaceful contented home in the family "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21118"],["title","Etheldreda the Ready: A School Story (#7)"],["body","a beloved niece.  Neither was it a very serious parting, since nothing was so certain as that so true a friend must return again and again to the scene of her labours; to see Hereward in his first uniform; to attend Rowena's marriage; Dreda's coming out; and inspect the progress of her youngest pupils.  A few tears were shed when the hour of parting actually arrived, but there was no bitterness in them on either side, nor were they of any long duration.  And now for Etheldreda's turn!  When the morning dawned on which she was to depart for school, she felt it fitting that her toilette should express the melancholy of her mood.  Dreda had a great idea of fitness, and a costume composed of an old shepherd plaid skirt, a grey flannel blouse and a black tie seemed admirably symbolic of what she herself described as \"the mourning of her soul.\"  When it was donned, however, the result was found to be so extremely unbecoming that resolution wavered, and collapsed.  After all, the most important matter was to impress her new companions, and there was no denying that that could be done most effectively in blue--in just such a blue as was at that moment hanging in the wardrobe ready for use.  With light-like speed Dreda shed her dun-coloured garments on to the floor, and in a trice was arrayed in her prettiest, most becoming costume.  This time the reflection was so pleasing that it was quite an effort to pull down her chin, and drop her eyelids, with the air of melancholy resignation which she was determined at all costs to preserve during breakfast.  Mrs Saxon's face brightened at sight of the pretty blue dress, but neither she nor any other member of the family mentioned the fatal word \"school.\"  Rather did each one try to give a cheerful turn to the conversation, and to lead it towards a discussion of those topics in which the heroine of the day was the most interested.  \"Sops!\" murmured Dreda dramatically to herself.  \"Sops!\"  She struggled hard to restrain her longing for a second helping of bacon; but her courage gave out at the thought of the motor drive across the cold open country.  \"I must strengthen myself with plenty of nourishment,\" she decided, as she handed over her plate, and accepted the offer of a third cup of coffee.  Like all pleasant things, however, the meal came to an end at last, and then the great event of the day could no longer be ignored. Maud caught the glance exchanged between her parents, and felt herself freed from her promise of silence.  \"_Now_!\" she exclaimed, with a gusty sigh of relief.  \"Now for the Buns! _Now_ you'll see which knows most, them or you.  Them, I should think, 'cause they're clever, and you forget.  Miss Bruce said your head was like a sieve.  Do you remember the day she said it?  She had on her jet chain, and jingled with the beads.  You'll have to remember not to forget, or you'll be the bottom of the class.  Fancy three Currant Buns on top!\"  She stopped short, with her characteristic throaty little laugh, and Dreda glared at her with flashing eyes.  It was really extraordinary that anyone so stupid as Maud should so often succeed in hitting upon just the most aggravating thing to say under the circumstances.  Three Currant Buns on top indeed!  Life would only be endurable if she herself could seize the leading place, and hold it relentlessly to the end.  She would not condescend to reply, and Maud was hurriedly nudged, and poked, and \"shoved\" into silence by Rowena, who was in an unusually sympathetic mood, realising how she herself would have felt had fate cast her own scholastic lot with that of the Misses Webster.  \"Never mind her,\" she whispered, consolingly, as she followed Dreda upstairs to put on hat and jacket before her departure.  \"It's not worth while troubling yourself about Maud's remarks.  It's impossible to think that any of those girls will get the better of _you_!  It's hateful, of course; but perhaps it may not be quite so hateful as we think--\"  \"Oh, I don't mind.  I'm resigned!  One can only be as miserable as one can.  Perhaps I'll have an accident some day, riding over those rough roads, and then it will all be finished.  I don't mind how soon my life is over!\" declared Dreda, harpooning her hat viciously with a pin of murderous length, ornamented at the head by a life-size imitation of a tomato.  \"But while I _do_ live, I tell you one thing, Rowena, I'll-- I'll _hold my own_!\"  \"I'm sure of that,\" assented Rowena, with conviction.  \"Look here, Dreda, would you like me to drive over with you as well as mother?  I could, you know; and it might break the ice!\"  \"No, no!  Father wanted to come, but I begged not.  Everything is arranged, and I don't want people looking on.  It will be a _hidjus_ ordeal!\"  \"Oh, my dear, come!  Don't exaggerate.  It's not so tragic as all that.\"  \"Isn't it, then?  Don't be so grown-up and horrid!  How would _you_ like it yourself, if anyone made the best of your having to teach Maud?\"  That one trenchant question was sufficient to reduce Rowena to the depths of silent despair, and the two sisters descended the staircase with aspects equally lugubrious and mournful.  It was not a cheerful send-off, despite all the efforts of the family, who stood shivering in the porch to wave farewells, and call out encouraging prognostications so long as the motor remained in sight. Dreda drew a big sigh of relief as they turned out of the drive, and spun rapidly along the highway.  The necessity for keeping up a part was over, and involuntarily she began softly whistling beneath her breath, for in truth she was by no means so miserable as she had striven to appear.  Novelty was the breath of Dreda's nostrils.  Any novelty to her was better than none, and if the chance of returning to the house had at that moment been vouchsafed, it is doubtful if she would have accepted it at the cost of missing the excitements of the next few hours.  The car spun along strongly, so that the twenty miles' distance was speedily covered, and before Etheldreda was half-way through her dreams it had turned in at a gate, and there before her eyes lay Grey House, a square, pretentious-looking building, with a door in the middle and a stretch of three windows on either side.  There, also--oh! thrilling and exciting moment--pressed against the panes of an upper window were a number of round white discs, which must obviously be the faces of pupils watching the advent of the new girl!  Dreda sat up, and throwing back her golden mane, tossed a laughing remark to her mother--the first she had volunteered since leaving home, and showed her white teeth in a determined smile.  If she were fated to arrive at all, she would arrive as a conqueror who would be regarded with envy and admiration.  Privately, she might consider herself a martyr, but that was not a role in which she chose to appear before other people.  She was smiling as she entered the drawing-room after her mother, smiling as Miss Bretherton came forward to greet them, smiling still, a forced, fixed smile, as she listened to the conversation between the two ladies.  \"Hope we shall be very happy together--\"  (\"I shan't.  I don't like you a bit!  Scraggy, cross-looking thing! Your nose looks as if it would cut!\")  \"...Dreda is fond of society.  She will enjoy working with other girls!\"  (\"Shan't, then!  I shall hate it.  I should have enjoyed it in Paris.\")  \"...Beginnings always are a little difficult; but young people _soon_ adapt themselves!\"  (\"It's easy to talk!\")  After a few minutes passed in the exchange of these and similar commonplaces, Mrs Saxon rose to depart.  On a previous visit she had been shown over the house, and had seen the room where her daughter was to sleep, and now her presence would only prolong the agony.  She cast a look at her daughter, full of yearning mother love and sympathy; but Dreda was smiling still, her grey eyes wide open, her very gums showing in the unnatural stretching of her lips.  She submitted to be kissed, but offered no caress in return, and turned with a nonchalant air to examine the photographs on the mantelshelf, while Miss Bretherton escorted her mother to the door.  They were all photographs of girls--old girls who had left school and could afford to be amiable and forgiving.  One wore a cap and gown and was evidently a crack pupil who had won honours at college; another held a baby on her knee--she was pretty, and had married young; a third supported her head on her hand and stared dreamily into space; another posed against a screen.  Dreda stared at them with eyes that grew misty and unseeing, as the motor puffed down the drive.  Now she was alone-- away from home for the first time in her life!  Miss Bretherton was coming back--Miss Bretherton with the thin face and the sharply pointed nose.  The door opened; the photographs looked mistier than ever; Miss Bretherton's voice sounded from an immense distance, saying in cheery tones:  \"Now I am going to take you upstairs to see your room, Etheldreda. Susan Webster and Nancy West will share it with you.  Susan you know already--a delightful girl; and Nancy is equally charming.  Most of the girls returned last night, but we have not yet settled into regular work: it takes a little time to arrange the classes.  Are your boots quite clean?  Better rub them once more on the mat!  Pupils are not allowed to ascend the staircase in outdoor shoes.\"  She led the way forward, while Dreda followed, looking about with curious eyes.  The carpet lasted only so long as the stair could be seen from the hall beneath, and was then replaced by oil-cloth, worn to a colourless drab by the tramp of many feet.  On the first storey a narrow passage ran the whole length of the house, and innumerable doors seemed to open on each side.  The murmur of voices could be heard from within, as one passed these closed portals; but one of the number, labelled Number 5, was not quite shut, and Dreda had a shrewd suspicion that it"]]]
