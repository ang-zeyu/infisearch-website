Two teenage boys of about the same age come from families which have been in intense rivalry for centuries.  Each of them lives in a castle set among the wild and desolate hills of Derbyshire, an almost mountainous area in the Midlands of England, known generally as the Peak District.  The boys know each other but as enemies.  Yet events occur which draw them together as allies, but they dare not call themselves friends.  A roguish band of ex-soldiers have arrived in the district, and set up camp out on the moors, from whence they descend to steal from, rob and loot the houses of the poorer folk.  The boys privately form an alliance using the men working on their fathers' land as a private army, to attack and rid the land of these desperadoes.  Their first attack results in dreadful failure.  But then they revise their ideas of what they can use for weaponry, and are finally successful.  Yet another excellent book from the prolific pen of this great author. NH _______________________________________________________________________  THE BLACK TOR, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN, A TALE OF THE REIGN OF JAMES THE FIRST.    CHAPTER ONE.  ONE CAPTAIN PURLROSE.  About as rugged, fierce-looking a gang of men as a lad could set eyes on, as they struggled up the steep cliff road leading to the castle, which frowned at the summit, where the flashing waters of the Gleame swept round three sides of its foot, half hidden by the beeches and birches, which overhung the limpid stream.  The late spring was at its brightest and best, but there had been no rain; and as the men who had waded the river lower down, climbed the steep cliff road, they kicked up the white limestone dust, and caked their wet high boots, which, in several instances, had opened holes in which toes could be seen, looking like curious reptiles deep in gnarled and crumpled shells.  \"Beggars!  What a gang!\" said Ralph Darley, a dark, swarthy lad of perhaps seventeen, but looking older, from having an appearance of something downy beginning to come up that spring about his chin, and a couple of streaks, like eyebrows out of place, upon his upper lip.  He was well dressed, in the fashion of Solomon King James's day; and he wore a sword, as he sat half up the rugged slope, on a huge block of limestone, which had fallen perhaps a hundred years before, from the cliff above, and was mossy now, and half hidden by the ivy which covered its side.  \"Beggars,\" he said again; \"and what a savage looking lot.\"  As they came on, it began to dawn upon him that they could not be beggars, for if so, they would have been the most truculent-looking party that ever asked for the contributions of the charitable.  One, who seemed to be their leader, was a fierce, grizzled, red-nosed fellow, wearing a rusty morion, in which, for want of a feather, a tuft of heather was stuck; he wore a long cloak, as rusty-looking as his helmet; and that he carried a sword was plain enough, for the well-worn scabbard had found a very convenient hole in the cloak, through which it had thrust itself in the most obtrusive manner, and looked like a tail with a vicious sting, for the cap of the leathern scabbard had been lost, and about three inches of steel blade and point were visible.  Ralph Darley was quick at observation, and took in quickly the fact that all the men were armed, and looked shabbier than their leader, though not so stout; for he was rubicund and portly, where he ought not to have been, for activity, though in a barrel a tubby space does indicate strength.  Neither were the noses of the other men so red as their leader's, albeit they were a villainous-looking lot.  \"Not beggars, but soldiers,\" thought Ralph; \"and they've been in the wars.\"  He was quite right, but he did not stop to think that there had been no wars for some years.  Still, as aforesaid, he was right, but the war the party had been in was with poverty.  \"What in the world do they want in this out-of-the-way place--on the road to nowhere?\" thought Ralph.  \"If they're not beggars, they have lost their way.\"  He pushed back the hilt of his sword, and drew up one leg, covered with its high, buff-leather boot, beneath him, holding it as he waited for the party to come slowly up; and as they did, they halted where he sat, at the side of the road, and the leader, puffing and panting, took off his rusty morion with his left hand, and wiped his pink, bald head, covered with drops of perspiration, with his right, as he rolled his eyes at the lad.  \"Hallo, young springald!\" he cried, in a blustering manner.  \"Why don't you jump up and salute your officer?\"  \"Because I can't see him,\" cried the lad sharply.  \"What?  And you carry a toasting-iron, like a rat's tail, by your side. Here, who made this cursed road, where it ought to have been a ladder?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Ralph angrily.  \"Who are you?  What do you want? This road does not lead anywhere.\"  \"That's a lie, my young cock-a-hoop; if it did not lead somewhere, it would not have been made.\"  The man's companions burst into a hoarse fit of laughter, and the boy flushed angrily.  \"Well,\" he said haughtily, \"it leads up to Cliff Castle, and no farther.\"  \"That's far enough for us, my game chicken.  Is that heap of blocks of stone on the top there the castle?\"  \"Yes!  What do you want?\"  The man looked the lad up and down, rolled one of his eyes, which looked something like that of a lobster, and then winked the lid over the inflated orb, and said:  \"Gentlemen on an ambassage don't read their despatches to every springald they see by the roadside.  Here, jump up, and show us the way, and I'll ask Sir Morton Darley to give you a stoup of wine for your trouble, or milk and water.\"  \"You ask Sir Morton to give you wine!\" cried the lad angrily.  \"Why, who are you, to dare such a thing?\"  \"What!\" roared the man.  \"Dare?  Who talks to Captain Purlrose, his Highness's trusted soldier, about dare?\" and he put on a tremendously fierce look, blew out his cheeks, drew his brows over his eyes, and slapped his sword-hilt heavily, as if to keep it in its sheath, for fear it should leap out and kill the lad, adding, directly after, in a hoarse whisper: \"Lie still, good sword, lie still.\"  All this theatrical display was evidently meant to awe the lad, but instead of doing so, it made him angry, for he flushed up, and said quickly:  \"I dare,\" and the men laughed.  \"You dare!\" cried the leader; \"and pray, who may you be, my bully boy?\"  \"I don't tell my name to every ragged fellow I meet in the road,\" said the boy haughtily.  \"What!\" roared the man, clapping his hand upon the hilt of his blade, an action imitated by his followers.  \"Keep your sword in its scabbard,\" said Ralph, without wincing in the least.  \"If you have business with my father, this way.\"  He sprang to his feet now, and gazed fiercely at the stranger.  \"What?\" cried the man, in a voice full of exuberant friendliness, which made the lad shrink in disgust, \"you the son of Sir Morton Darley?\"  \"Yes: what of it?\"  \"The son of my beloved old companion-in-arms?  Boy, let me embrace thee.\"  To Ralph's horror, the man took a step forward, and would have thrown his arms about his neck; but by a quick movement the lad stepped back, and the men laughed to see their leader grasp the wind.  \"Don't do that,\" said Ralph sternly.  \"Do you mean to say that you want to speak to my father?\"  \"Speak to him?  Yes, to fly to the hand of him whom I many a time saved from death.  And so you are the son of Morton Darley?  And a brave-looking, manly fellow too.  Why, I might have known.  Eye, nose, curled-up lip.  Yes: all there.  You are his very reflection, that I ought to have seen in the looking-glass of memory.  Excuse this weak moisture of the eyes, boy.  The sight of my old friend's son brings up the happy companionship of the past.  Time flies fast, my brave lad. Your father and I were hand and glove then.  Never separate.  We fought together, bled together, and ah! how fate is partial in the way she spreads her favours!  Your father dresses his son in velvet; while I, poor soldier of fortune--I mean misfortune--am growing rusty; sword, morion, breast-plate, body battered, and face scarred by time.\"  \"Aren't we going to have something to eat and drink, captain?\" growled one of the men, with an ugly scowl.  \"Ay, brave boys, and soon,\" cried the leader.  \"Then, leave off preaching, captain, till we've got our legs under a table.\"  \"Ah, yes.  Poor boys, they are footsore and weary with the walk across your hilly moors.  Excuse this emotion, young sir, and lead me to my old brother's side.\"  There was something comic in the boy's look of perplexity and disgust, as, after a few moments' hesitation, he began to lead the way toward the half castle, half manor-house, which crowned the great limestone cliff.  \"Surely,\" he thought, \"my father cannot wish to see such a ragamuffin as this, with his coarse, bloated features, and disgraceful rags and dirt.\"  But the next minute his thoughts took a different turn.  \"If what the man says be true, father will be only too glad to help an old brother-officer in misfortune, and be sorry to see him in such a plight.\"  With the frank generosity of youth, then, he softened his manner toward his companion, as they slowly climbed upward, the great beeches which grew out of the huge cracks and faults of the cliff shading them from the sun.  \"So this is the way?\" cried the man.  \"Yes: the castle is up there,\" and Ralph pointed.  \"What! in ruins?\" cried the captain.  \"Ruins?  No!\" cried Ralph.  \"Those stones are natural; the top of the cliff.  Our place is behind them.  They do look like ruins, though.\"  \"Hah!  But what an eagle's nest.  No wonder I find an eaglet on my way.\"  Ralph winced, for the man"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21298"],["title","The Black Tor: A Tale of the Reign of James the First (#1)"],["body","a dirty hand upon his shoulder, and gripped him fast, turning the lad into a walking-staff to help him on his road.  \"Have you come far this morning?\" said Ralph, to conceal his disgust.  \"Ay, miles and miles, over stones and streams, and in and out among mines and holes.  We were benighted, too, up yonder on the mountain.\"  \"Hill,\" said Ralph; \"we have no mountains here.\"  \"Hills when you're fresh, lad; mountains when you're footsore and weary. But we stumbled upon a niche, in a bit of a slope near the top, and turned out the bats and foxes, and slept there.\"  \"Where?\" cried Ralph quickly.  \"Was there a little stream running there--warm water?\"  \"To be sure there was.  Hard stones, and warm water: those were our bed and beverage last night.\"  \"I know the place.  Darch Scarr.\"  \"Fine scar, too, lad.  Been better if it had been healed up, with a door to keep out the cold wind.  Oh! so this is where my old comrade lives,\" he added, as he came in sight of an arched gateway, with embattled top and turrets, while through the entry, a tree-shaded courtyard could be seen.  \"And a right good dwelling too.  Come on, brave boys.  Here's rest and breakfast at last.\"  \"And I hope you'll go directly after,\" thought Ralph, as he led the way into the courtyard, and paused at a second entrance, at the top of a flight of stone steps, well commanded by loopholes on either side.  Then aloud:  \"Will you wait here a minute, while I go and tell my father?\"  \"Yes: tell him his old brother-officer is here.\"  \"I did not catch your name when you spoke before,\" said Ralph.  \"Captain Pearl Ross?\"  \"Nay, nay, boy; Purlrose.  He'll know directly you speak.  Tell him, I'm waiting to grasp him by the hand.\"  Ralph nodded, and sprang up the stone flight, while the visitor's companions threw themselves down upon the steps to rest, their leader remaining standing, and placing himself by the mounting stone on one side, hand upon sword-hilt, and arranging his ragged cloak in folds with as much care as if it had been of newest velvet.    CHAPTER TWO.  SIR MORTON RECEIVES HIS GUEST.  \"Father can't be pleased,\" thought the lad, as he hurried in through a heavy oaken door, strengthened by the twisted and scrolled iron bands of the huge hinges, and studded with great-headed nails.  This yielded heavily, as, seizing a ring which moved a lever, he raised the heavy latch, and for a moment, as he passed through, he hesitated about closing the door again upon the group below.  But as he glanced at the party, he hesitated no longer.  Their appearance begat no confidence, and the great latch clicked directly.  The next minute, he was hurrying along a dark stone passage, to spring up a few more stairs, leading into a corridor with a polished oaken floor, and mullioned windows looking down upon the courtyard; and as he reached the second, a bright, handsome girl, whose features proclaimed sisterhood, started out to meet him.  \"Oh Ralph,\" she said, \"who are those dreadful-looking men you have brought up?\"  \"Don't stop me, Min,\" he said hastily.  \"Old soldiers who want to see father.  Where is he?\"  \"In his room.\"  The lad hurried on, and entered through a door way on his left, to where, in an oaken-panelled room, a stern, slightly grey, military-looking man sat poring over an old book, but looked up directly the lad entered.  \"Ah, Ralph, boy,\" he said; \"been out?\"  \"Only on the cliff, father,\" cried the lad hastily.  \"Visitors.\"  \"Visitors?  Nonsense!  I expect no visitors.  Who are they?\"  \"Captain Purlrose and his men.\"  \"Purlrose!\" cried Sir Morton, with a look of angry disgust.  \"Here?\"  \"Yes, father,\" said Ralph, watching keenly the impression made by his words.  \"Waiting at the foot of the steps.\"  \"Bah!  I thought the drunken, bullying scoundrel was dead and gone years ago.  Hung or shot, for he deserved either.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated the lad, with a sigh of relief.  \"Then you are not glad to see him, father?\"  \"Glad to see him?  Are you mad, boy?\"  \"No, father,\" said the lad, with a merry laugh.  \"I hope not; but he said you would be, and that you were old brothers-in-arms, and that he longed to grip you by the hand; and he tried to hug me, and shed tears, and flattered me, and said all sorts of things.\"  \"Pah! the same as of old; but you said--and his men.\"  \"Yes, about a dozen like him; ruffianly-looking, rag-bags of fellows, all armed, and looking like a gang of bullies and robbers.\"  Sir Morton frowned, rose from his seat, and walked to the side of the room, where his sword and belt lay in front of a bookcase.  \"Well, I suppose I must see the fellow.  He served under me, years ago, Ralph, and I suppose he has come begging, unless he sees a chance to steal.\"  \"Then I was not unjust, father, in thinking ill of the man and disliking him.\"  \"Unjust?  Pah!  The fellow was a disgrace to the name of soldier; and now, I suppose, that there is no war on the way, he has been discharged from the king's service, with a pack of his companions.\"  \"He said he had saved your life, father.\"  Sir Morton laughed contemptuously.  \"I have no recollection of the fact, Ralph, boy, and I don't think I should have forgotten so important a matter; but I do recollect saving his, by interceding when he was about to be shot for plundering some helpless people.  There; let him and a couple of his men come in.  The poor wretch is in a bad state, I suppose, and I will give him something to help him on his road.\"  Ralph went to the door, but turned back, hesitating.  \"Well, my boy?\" said his father.  \"Had I not better tell some of the men to arm, and be ready?\" asked the lad.  \"What!  Nonsense, boy!  I know my man.  He would not dare to be insolent.\"  \"But he has a dangerous-looking gang of fellows with him.\"  \"Of the same kind as himself, Ralph.  Have no fear of that.  If there were real danger, we could soon summon a dozen stout men to deal with him and his party.  But, as I said, let him only bring in two or three with him.\"  Ralph hurried out, and found the captain and his men forming a picturesque group about the stone steps; and as soon as he appeared, the former swung himself round, and threw his cloak over his shoulder, with a swaggering gesture.  \"Hallo, my young eagle,\" he cried.  \"What saith the parent bird, the gallant lord of the castle?\"  \"My father will see you, sir,\" replied Ralph.  \"This way.\"  \"Aha!  I knew he would,\" cried the man, giving his steel cap a cock over on one side, and displaying a large pink patch of his bald head.  \"Come on, brave boys.\"  \"Stop!\" cried Ralph quickly.  \"Three of you, only, are to accompany your leader.\"  \"Eh?  What?\" cried the captain fiercely, as a low murmur arose.  \"That is what my father said, sir.\"  \"What does this mean?\" cried the man theatrically.  \"Separate me from my brave companions-in-arms?  Does this mean treachery, young sir?\"  \"Treachery?  Why should it mean that?\" cried Ralph stoutly, as the man's words endorsed the character so lately given of him.  \"If,\" argued Ralph to himself, \"the fellow were the honest, brave soldier, why should he fear treachery from the brother-officer with whom he said he had often shared danger?\"  \"The world is full of wickedness, boy,\" replied the captain; \"and I have often been misjudged.  But there; a brave man never knows fear.  You three come with me, and if in half an hour I do not come back, boys, you know what to do.\"  There was a shout at this, and hands struck sword-hilts with a loud clang.  \"Right, brave boys, and don't leave one stone upon another until you have found your captain.\"  Ralph burst out into a fit of laughter, and then felt annoyed with himself, as the man turned round scowling.  \"What do you mean by that, boy?\"  \"That your men would have their work cut out, sir,\" said Ralph sharply. \"This way, please.\"  The captain uttered a low growl, signed to three of his men, and the party followed the lad, who, to his annoyance, once more came across his sister, hurrying along the passage.  \"Salute, brave boys, salute,\" cried the captain.  \"Youth and beauty in front--the worship of the gallant soldiers of the king.\"  He struck an attitude, which was roughly imitated by the men.  \"A sister, on my life,\" cried the captain.  \"This way,\" said Ralph shortly, and with the colour coming into his cheeks, as he felt indignant with the man for daring to notice his sister, and angry with her for being there.  The door of Sir Morton's room was thrown open, and the captain strode in, followed by his men; and, as he saw the knight, standing with his back to the fireplace, he struck a fresh attitude.  \"Ah! at last!\" he cried.  \"My old brave companion-in-arms!  Well met, once more.\"  He stretched out his hands, and swaggered forward to grasp Sir Morton's.  \"Halt!\" cried that gentleman sharply, without stirring from his position.  \"Now, Captain Purlrose, what is your business with me?\"  \"Business with you?  Is this my reception, after long years of absence? Ah, I see!  The war-worn soldier forgotten once again.  Ah, Sir Morton Darley, why humble me before my gallant men?\"  \"I have not forgotten you, Captain Purlrose.  I remember you perfectly, and you are not changed in the least.  Now, if you please, be brief, and explain your business.\"  \"My business!  I thought I was coming to an old friend and brother.\"  \"No, sir; you thought nothing of the kind.  Come, you know I understand you thoroughly.  State your business, if you please.\"  The three men laughed aloud, and Sir Morton, who had not before noticed them, turned upon them sharply, with the result that the laughter died out, and they looked uncomfortable.  \"And this before my men!  Humbled thus!  Have I fallen so low?\"  \"You are wasting words, Captain Purlrose; and, as you have found where I lived, and have evidently journeyed long, tell me at once why you have come.\"  \"I will,\" cried the captain, resuming his swaggering air.  \"I, as an old soldier, sir, came to ask favours of no man.\"  \"Then why have you come, sir, if not to ask a favour?\""]]]
