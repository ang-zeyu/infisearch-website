That a fish, more than sixty feet long, and thirty feet round the body; with the bulk of three hundred fat oxen rolled into one; with the strength of many hundreds of horses; able to swim at a rate that would carry it right round the world in twenty-three days; that can smash a boat to atoms with one slap of its tail, and stave in the planks of a ship with one blow of its thick skull;--that such a monster can be caught and killed by man, is most wonderful to hear of, but I can tell from experience that it is much more wonderful to see.  There is a wise saying which I have often thought much upon.  It is this: \"Knowledge is power\".  Man is but a feeble creature, and if he had to depend on his own bodily strength alone he could make no head against even the ordinary brutes in this world.  But the knowledge which has been given to him by his Maker has clothed man with great power, so that he is more than a match for the fiercest beast in the forest, or the largest fish in the sea. Yet, with all his knowledge, with all his experience, and all his power, the killing of a great old sperm whale costs man a long, tough battle, sometimes it even costs him his life.  It is a long time now since I took to fighting the whales.  I have been at it, man and boy, for nigh forty years, and many a wonderful sight have I seen; many a desperate battle have I fought in the fisheries of the North and South Seas.  Sometimes, when I sit in the chimney-corner of a winter evening, smoking my pipe with my old messmate Tom Lokins, I stare into the fire and think of the days gone by till I forget where I am, and go on thinking so hard that the flames seem to turn into melting fires, and the bars of the grate into dead fish, and the smoke into sails and rigging, and I go to work cutting up the blubber and stirring the oil-pots, or pulling the bow-oar and driving the harpoon at such a rate that I can't help giving a shout, which causes Tom to start and cry:  \"Hallo!  Bob\" (my name is Bob Ledbury, you see).  \"Hallo!  Bob, wot's the matter?\"  To which I reply, \"Tom, can it all be true?\"  \"Can _wot_ be true?\" says he, with a stare of surprise--for Tom is getting into his dotage now.  And then I chuckle and tell him I was only thinking of old times, and so he falls to smoking again, and I to staring at the fire, and thinking as hard as ever.  The way in which I was first led to go after the whales was curious. This is how it happened.  About forty years ago, when I was a boy of nearly fifteen years of age, I lived with my mother in one of the seaport towns of England. There was great distress in the town at that time, and many of the hands were out of work. My employer, a blacksmith, had just died, and for more than six weeks I had not been able to get employment or to earn a farthing.  This caused me great distress, for my father had died without leaving a penny in the world, and my mother depended on me entirely.  The money I had saved out of my wages was soon spent, and one morning when I sat down to breakfast, my mother looked across the table and said, in a thoughtful voice:  \"Robert, dear, this meal has cost us our last halfpenny.\"  My mother was old and frail, and her voice very gentle; she was the most trustful, uncomplaining woman I ever knew.  I looked up quickly into her face as she spoke.  \"All the money gone, Mother?\"  \"Aye, all.  It will be hard for you to go without your dinner, Robert, dear.\"  \"It will be harder for _you_, Mother,\" I cried, striking the table with my fist; then a lump rose in my throat and almost choked me.  I could not utter another word.  It was with difficulty I managed to eat the little food that was before me.  After breakfast I rose hastily and rushed out of the house, determined that I would get my mother her dinner, even if I should have to beg for it.  But I must confess that a sick feeling came over me when I thought of begging.  Hurrying along the crowded streets without knowing very well what I meant to do, I at last came to an abrupt halt at the end of the pier. Here I went up to several people and offered my services in a wild sort of way.  They must have thought that I was drunk, for nearly all of them said gruffly that they did not want me.  Dinner-time drew near, but no one had given me a job, and no wonder, for the way in which I tried to get one was not likely to be successful.  At last I resolved to beg.  Observing a fat, red-faced old gentleman coming along the pier, I made up to him boldly.  He carried a cane with a large gold knob on the top of it. That gave me hope, \"for of course,\" thought I, \"he must be rich.\"  His nose, which was exactly the colour and shape of the gold knob on his cane, was stuck in the centre of a round, good-natured countenance, the mouth of which was large and firm; the eyes bright and blue.  He frowned as I went forward hat in hand; but I was not to be driven back; the thought of my starving mother gave me power to crush down my rising shame.  Yet I had no reason to be ashamed.  I was willing to work, if only I could have got employment.  Stopping in front of the old gentleman, I was about to speak when I observed him quietly button up his breeches pocket.  The blood rushed to my face, and, turning quickly on my heel, I walked away without uttering a word.  \"Hallo!\" shouted a gruff voice just as I was moving away.  I turned, and observed that the shout was uttered by a broad rough-looking jack-tar, a man of about two or three and thirty, who had been sitting all the forenoon on an old cask smoking his pipe and basking in the sun.  \"Hallo!\" said he again.  \"Well,\" said I.  \"Wot d'ye mean, youngster, by goin' on in that there fashion all the mornin', a-botherin' everybody, and makin' a fool o' yourself like that? eh!\"  \"What's that to you?\" said I savagely, for my heart was sore and heavy, and I could not stand the interference of a stranger.  \"Oh! it's nothin' to me of course,\" said the sailor, picking his pipe quietly with his clasp-knife; \"but come here, boy, I've somethin' to say to ye.\"  \"Well, what is it?\" said I, going up to him somewhat sulkily.  The man looked at me gravely through the smoke of his pipe, and said, \"You're in a passion, my young buck, that's all; and, in case you didn't know it, I thought I'd tell ye.\"  I burst into a fit of laughter.  \"Well, I believe you're not far wrong; but I'm better now.\"  \"Ah! that's right,\" said the sailor, with an approving nod of his head; \"always confess when you're in the wrong.  Now, younker, let me give you a bit of advice.  Never get into a passion if you can help it, and if you can't help it get out of it as fast as possible, and if you can't get out of it, just give a great roar to let off the steam and turn about and run.  There's nothing like that.  Passion han't got legs.  It can't hold on to a feller when he's runnin'.  If you keep it up till you a'most split your timbers, passion has no chance.  It _must_ go a-starn. Now, lad, I've been watchin' ye all the mornin', and I see there's a screw loose somewhere.  If you'll tell me wot it is, see if I don't help you!\"  The kind frank way in which this was said quite won my heart, so I sat down on the old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.  \"Boy,\" said he, when I had finished, \"I'll put you in the way o' helpin' your mother.  I can get you a berth in my ship, if you're willin' to take a trip to the whale fishery of the South Seas.\"  \"And who will look after my mother when I'm away?\" said I.  The sailor looked perplexed at the question.  \"Ah! that's a puzzler,\" he replied, knocking the ashes out of his pipe. \"Will you take me to your mother's house, lad?\"  \"Willingly,\" said I, and, jumping up, I led the way.  As we turned to go, I observed that the old gentleman with the gold-headed cane was leaning over the rail of the pier at a short distance from us.  A feeling of anger instantly rose within me, and I exclaimed, loud enough for him to hear:  \"I do believe that stingy old chap has been listening to every word we've been saying!\"  I thought I observed a frown on the sailor's brow as I said this, but he made no remark, and in a few minutes we were walking rapidly through the streets.  My companion stopped at one of those stores so common in seaport towns, where one can buy almost anything, from a tallow candle to a brass cannon.  Here he  [Transcriber's note: two pages missing from book]  I've got neither family nor friends, and I'm bound for the South Seas in six days; so, if you'll take it, you're welcome to it, and if your son Bob can manage to cast loose from you without leaving you to sink, I'll take him aboard the ship that I sail in.  He'll always find me at the Bull and Griffin, in the High Street, or at the end o' the pier.\"  While the sailor was speaking, I observed a figure standing in a dark corner of the room near the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21202"],["title","Fighting the Whales (#1)"],["body","door, and, on looking more closely, I found that it was the old gentleman with the nose like his cane knob.  Seeing that he was observed, he came forward and said:  \"I trust that you will forgive my coming here without invitation; but I happened to overhear part of the conversation between your son and this seaman, and I am willing to help you over your little difficulty, if you will allow me.\"  The old gentleman said this in a very quick, abrupt way, and looked as if he were afraid his offer might be refused.  He was much heated, with climbing our long stair no doubt, and as he stood in the middle of the room, puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief, my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair.  \"You are very kind, sir,\" she said; \"do sit down, sir.  I'm sure I don't know why you should take so much trouble.  But, dear me, you are very warm; will you take a cup of tea to cool you?\"  \"Thank you, thank you.  With much pleasure, unless, indeed, your son objects to a '_stingy old chap_' sitting beside him.\"  I blushed when he repeated my words, and attempted to make some apology; but the old gentleman stopped me by commencing to explain his intentions in short, rapid sentences.  To make a long story short, he offered to look after my mother while I was away, and, to prove his sincerity, laid down five shillings, and said he would call with that sum every week as long as I was absent. My mother, after some trouble, agreed to let me go, and, before that evening closed, everything was arranged, and the gentleman, leaving his address, went away.  The sailor had been so much filled with surprise at the suddenness of all this, that he could scarcely speak.  Immediately after the departure of the old gentleman, he said, \"Well, good-bye, mistress, good-bye, Bob,\" and throwing on his hat in a careless way, left the room.  \"Stop!\" I shouted after him, when he had got about half-way down stair.  \"Hallo! wot's wrong now?\"  \"Nothing; I only forgot to ask your name.\"  \"Tom Lokins,\" he bellowed, in the hoarse voice of a regular boatswain, \"w'ich wos my father's name before me.\"  So saying, he departed, whistling \"Rule, Britannia,\" with all his might.  Thus the matter was settled.  Six days afterwards, I rigged myself out in a blue jacket, white ducks, and a straw hat, and went to sea.     CHAPTER II  AT SEA  My first few days on the ocean were so miserable that I oftentimes repented of having left my native land.  I was, as my new friend Tom Lokins said, as sick as a dog.  But in course of time I grew well, and began to rejoice in the cool fresh breezes and the great rolling billows of the sea.  Many and many a time I used to creep out to the end of the bowsprit, when the weather was calm, and sit with my legs dangling over the deep blue water, and my eyes fixed on the great masses of rolling clouds in the sky, thinking of the new course of life I had just begun.  At such times the thought of my mother was sure to come into my mind, and I thought of her parting words, \"Put your trust in the Lord, Robert, and read His Word.\"  I resolved to try to obey her, but this I found was no easy matter, for the sailors were a rough lot of fellows, who cared little for the Bible.  But, I must say, they were a hearty, good-natured set, and much better, upon the whole, than many a ship's crew that I afterwards sailed with.  We were fortunate in having fair winds this voyage, and soon found ourselves on the other side of the _line_, as we jack-tars call the Equator.  Of course the crew did not forget the old custom of shaving all the men who had never crossed the line before.  Our captain was a jolly old man, and uncommonly fond of \"sky-larking\".  He gave us leave to do what we liked the day we crossed the line; so, as there were a number of wild spirits among us, we broke through all the ordinary rules, or, rather, we added on new rules to them.  The old hands had kept the matter quiet from us greenhorns, so that, although we knew they were going to do some sort of mischief, we didn't exactly understand what it was to be.  About noon of that day I was called on deck and told that old father Neptune was coming aboard, and we were to be ready to receive him.  A minute after I saw a tremendous monster come up over the side of the ship and jump on the deck.  He was crowned with seaweed, and painted in a wonderful fashion; his clothes were dripping wet, as if he had just come from the bottom of the sea.  After him came another monster with a petticoat made of sailcloth and a tippet of a bit of old tarpaulin. This was Neptune's wife, and these two carried on the most remarkable antics I ever saw.  I laughed heartily, and soon discovered, from the tones of their voices, which of my shipmates Neptune and his wife were. But my mirth was quickly stopped when I was suddenly seized by several men, and my face was covered over with a horrible mixture of tar and grease!  Six of us youngsters were treated in this way; then the lather was scraped off with a piece of old hoop-iron, and, after being thus shaved, buckets of cold water were thrown over us.  At last, after a prosperous voyage, we arrived at our fishing-ground in the South Seas, and a feeling of excitement and expectation began to show itself among the men, insomuch that our very eyes seemed brighter than usual.  One night those of us who had just been relieved from watch on deck were sitting on the lockers down below telling ghost stories.  It was a dead calm, and one of those intensely dark, hot nights, that cause sailors to feel uneasy, they scarce know why.  I began to feel so uncomfortable at last, listening to the horrible tales which Tom Lokins was relating to the men, that I slipt away from them with the intention of going on deck.  I moved so quietly that no one observed me; besides, every eye was fixed earnestly on Tom, whose deep low voice was the only sound that broke the stillness of all around.  As I was going very cautiously up the ladder leading to the deck, Tom had reached that part of his story where the ghost was just appearing in a dark churchyard, dressed in white, and coming slowly forward, one step at a time, towards the terrified man who saw it.  The men held their breath, and one or two of their faces turned pale as Tom went on with his description, lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper.  Just as I put my head up the hatchway the sheet of one of the sails, which was hanging loose in the still air, passed gently over my head and knocked my hat off.  At any other time I would have thought nothing of this, but Tom's story had thrown me into such an excited and nervous condition that I gave a start, missed my footing, uttered a loud cry, and fell down the ladder right in among the men with a tremendous crash, knocking over two or three oil-cans and a tin bread-basket in my fall, and upsetting the lantern, so that the place was instantly pitch-dark.  I never heard such a howl of terror as these men gave vent to when this misfortune befell me.  They rushed upon deck with their hearts in their mouths, tumbling, and peeling the skin off their shins and knuckles in their haste; and it was not until they heard the laughter of the watch on deck that they breathed freely, and, joining in the laugh, called themselves fools for being frightened by a ghost story.  I noticed, however, that, for all their pretended indifference, there was not one man among them--not even Tom Lokins himself--who would go down below to relight the lantern for at least a quarter of an hour afterwards!  Feeling none the worse for my fall, I went forward and leaned over the bow of the ship, where I was much astonished by the appearance of the sea.  It seemed as if the water was on fire.  Every time the ship's bow rose and fell, the little belt of foam made in the water seemed like a belt of blue flame with bright sparkles in it, like stars or diamonds. I had seen this curious appearance before, but never so bright as it was on that night.  \"What is it, Tom?\" said I, as my friend came forward and leaned over the ship's bulwark beside me.  \"It's blue fire, Bob,\" replied Tom, as he smoked his pipe calmly.  \"Come, you know I can't swallow that,\" said I; \"everybody knows that fire, either blue or red, can't burn in the water.\"  \"Maybe not,\" returned Tom; \"but it's blue fire for all that.  Leastwise if it's not, I don't know wot else it is.\"  Tom had often seen this light before, no doubt, but he had never given himself the trouble to find out what it could be.  Fortunately the captain came up just as I put the question, and he enlightened me on the subject.  \"It is caused by small animals,\" said he, leaning over the side.  \"Small animals!\" said I, in astonishment.  \"Aye; many parts of the sea are full of creatures so small and so thin and colourless, that you can hardly see them even in a clear glass tumbler.  Many of them are larger than others, but the most of them are very small.\"  \"But how do they shine like that, sir?\" I asked.  \"That I do not know, boy.  God has given them the power to shine, just as he has given us the power to walk or speak; and they do shine brightly, as you see; but how they do it is more than I can tell.  I think, myself, it must be anger that makes them shine, for they generally do it when they are stirred up or knocked about by oars, or ships' keels, or tumbling waves.  But I am not sure that that's the reason either, because, you know, we often sail through them without seeing the light, though of course they must be there.\"  \"P'r'aps, sir,\" said Tom Lokins; \"p'r'aps, sir, they're sleepy sometimes, an' can't be bothered gettin' angry.\"  \"Perhaps!\" answered the captain, laughing.  \"But then again, at other times, I have seen them shining over the whole sea when it was quite calm, making it like an ocean of milk; and nothing was disturbing them at that time, d'ye see.\"  \"I don' know _that_,\" objected Tom; \"they might have bin a-fightin' among theirselves.\"  \"Or playing,"]]]
