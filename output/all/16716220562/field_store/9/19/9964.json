Mrs Bracewell and Mary were very unhappy when Harry placed the state of the case before them; but they acknowledged that he ought to act as the firm wished.  My parents, to whom I wrote, expressed themselves much in the same way, only entreating that I would come and pay them a visit before starting.  As soon as I received their letter I placed it in the hands of Mr Crank, who seemed well pleased.  \"You will not have cause to regret going, as far as we are concerned,\" he observed; \"as for the rest, we must leave that to Providence.\"  Harry and I had, of course, been very often on board vessels, and made several trips down the Mersey, returning in the pilot-boat, but neither of us had ever been at sea.  It was necessary that we should both see the cargo stowed, and be acquainted with the contents of every bale.  As soon as it was stowed the brig would sail.  I therefore hastened over to the neighbourhood of Chester to pay my promised visit to my family.  \"I shall be gone only five or six months,\" I said cheerfully, fully believing that such would be the case.  \"I will take good care of myself, depend upon that.  I won't trust the black fellows, and will never sleep on shore.\"  On my return I found the vessel nearly ready to take in cargo.  Harry and I were employed from morning until night in the warehouse, examining and noting the goods.  We then both went on board, one remaining on deck to book them as they were hoisted in, the other going below to see them stowed away, so that we might know where each bale and package was to be found.  Captain Magor was also on board assisting us, as were his two mates, Tom Sherwin and Ned Capstick, both rough, honest hands, as far as I could judge, who had been chosen by the master simply because they were good seamen and bold fellows in whom he could trust.  While we stood by, notebooks in hand, it was their business to stow away the various packages; and as we were together many hours every day, we became pretty well acquainted before we sailed.  We had a few hours left after the cargo was on board and the hatches fastened down.  I should have said I had made all the inquiries I could for Captain Roderick, but could hear nothing of him, nor did he ever come near Mr Crank's house after he knew I saw him waiting at the door.  I had another reason for supposing that he had gone.  Mr Trunnion had regained his usual spirits, and looked as cheerful as he did before his brother's appearance.  \"You have acted discreetly, Westerton,\" said Mr Trunnion to me one day when I was alone with him in his private room.  \"Whether Captain Magor was right or not in the fearful accusation he brought against that unhappy man.  I know not.  The `Vulture' has, I trust, long since sailed.  I wish you to understand that, although she was once our vessel, she does not now belong to us, and I need not say how I fear she is employed.\"  I was pleased to receive this commendation from my principal.  I merely replied that I hoped to be always able to give him satisfaction in whatever way he might be pleased to employ me.  He shook hands with me warmly on parting.  \"You will receive full written directions from the firm for your guidance while on the coast, and I hope that we shall see you and Bracewell back again well and hearty in a few months with a full cargo.  I have great confidence in Captain Magor, into whose character, since he went to sea, we have made minute inquiries, and you will find him a bold and sagacious seaman, and an obliging and agreeable companion.\"  Before I left the counting-house, Mr Swab called me into his little den, into which he was wont to retire whenever he had any private business to transact, although he generally sat in the outer office, that he might keep an eye on the clerks and see that there was no idling.  \"My dear boy,\" he said in a kind tone, \"I have had a talk with Harry, and now I want to speak with you, and I'll say to you what I said to him: Work together with a will; do not let the slightest feeling of jealousy spring up between you, and give and take.  If he is right one time, you'll be ready to follow him the next; while, if your opinion proves correct, he will be ready to follow you.  I am sure you will both act as you consider best for the interest of the firm; and remember there is One above who sees you, and you must do nothing which He disapproves of--your conscience will tell you that.  You are to be engaged in a lawful traffic.  If carried on fairly, it must of necessity tend to advance the interest of the Africans.  We did them harm enough formerly when we were engaged in the slave trade, although I for one didn't see it at the time, and was entirely ignorant of the horrors it inflicted on the unfortunate natives.  If I thought at all, I thought they exchanged barbarism for civilisation; and what are called the horrors of the middle passage were not so great in those days as they are now, when the traffic has become unlawful.  We had roomy vessels, the slaves were well-fed and looked after; and the master had no fear of being chased by a man-of-war, so that they could wait in harbour when the weather was threatening, and run across the Atlantic with a favourable breeze.  You will very likely see something of the business, and hear more of it while you are up the rivers; but you must in no way interfere, either to help a slaver by supplying her with goods, provisions, or water, or by giving information to the man-of-war of her whereabouts, unless the question is asked, and you will then tell the truth.  And now about your personal conduct.  You must do all you can to keep your health.  Be strictly sober.  Do not expose yourself to the heat by day nor to the damp air by night, which is, I understand, more likely to prove injurious than even the sun's rays.  Never lose your temper with the natives, or any one else, for that matter; and, from what I can learn, you are often likely to be tried.  Many people fancy they show their spirit by losing their temper; in reality they always give an opponent an advantage over them, and the negroes are quick enough to perceive that.  Do not imagine them fools because they do not understand your language.  Indeed, I might say, as a golden rule, never hold too cheap the person with whom you are bargaining or an enemy with whom you are engaged in fighting.  You will, of course, be very exact in all your accounts, and endeavour to obtain such information as you possibly can from all directions likely to prove of further use to the firm.  Now, my dear boy, farewell.  I pray that you and Harry may be protected from the dangers to which you will be exposed.\"  The worthy man said much more to the same purpose.  The \"Arrow\" had, in the meantime, hauled out into the stream, and Harry and I went on board that evening, as she was to sail at daybreak, the tide being fair, the next morning.  Mrs Bracewell and Mary accompanied us, very naturally wishing to see the last of us; and just as we were setting out, Lucy Crank arrived, greatly to Harry's satisfaction.  \"Papa did not object to my going, and I thought that Mrs Bracewell and Mary would require some one to cheer them up,\" she said.  Mrs Bracewell smiled, for Lucy did not look as if she was very well capable of doing that.  She had evidently been crying, although she had done her best to dry her tears.  Just as we were at the water's edge, Mr Swab joined us, remarking as he did so, \"My partners are not able to come.  I wanted to have a few more words with Captain Magor, so that I shall have the satisfaction of escorting you ladies back.\"  I suspected that, in the kindness of his heart, the latter was his chief object.  \"Thank you,\" said Mrs Bracewell; \"we shall be glad of your protection. We wish to see Harry's and Mr Westerton's cabin, and the brig, now that she is ready for sea, so that we may picture them to ourselves when they are far away.\"  The evening was serene, the water smooth as glass, the slight breeze blowing down the river, being insufficient to enable us to stem the flood tide, which had then begun to make up, or we should at once have sailed.  Boats were plying backwards and forwards between the shore and the various vessels which lay in that much-frequented river.  Some, like the \"Arrow,\" ready for sea; others only just arrived, or taking cargo on board from lighters.  They were either bound to or had come from all parts of the world, the African traders perhaps predominating; but there were not a few either going to or coming from the West Indies, with which Liverpool had a considerable commerce.  There were South Sea whalers, high black vessels, with boats hoisted up on either side, and fast-sailing craft running up the Mediterranean, besides innumerable coasters.  Indeed, Liverpool had become a successful rival of Bristol, hitherto the chief commercial port of the kingdom.  The ladies were well pleased with our little berths off the main cabin, for Captain Magor had done his best to make them comfortable.  The cabin was well fitted, with a mahogany table, a sofa at the upper end, and two easy-chairs.  A swinging lamp was suspended above us, while the bulkhead in the fore part was ornamented with muskets, pistols, and cutlasses ranged in symmetrical order.  The brig carried seven guns, three on each side, and one long gun, which could be trained fore or aft to serve as a bow or stern chaser, while all told she had thirty hands, besides Harry and me; so that we were well able to cope with any ordinary enemy we were likely to meet with, either pirate or Frenchman, Spaniard or Hollander.  The captain had prepared tea on board, or rather supper. Mr Swab did his best to keep up the spirits of the party--which poor Lucy certainly failed in doing--by telling stories or cracking jokes, though he soon gave up the attempt when he saw none of us responded. Indeed, I must confess that both his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21490"],["title","The Two Supercargoes; Or, Adventures in Savage Africa (#5)"],["body","and stories were stale, and it might be added \"flat and unprofitable.\"  They did not flow naturally from him.  At length he discovered that the time was passing on; the shades of evening were already stealing over the broad surface of the magnificent stream.  The boat belonging to the firm had hauled up alongside, and Harry and I helped the ladies into her, Mr Swab following, and giving each of us a hearty shake of the hand.  As the boat rowed away they waved an adieu with their handkerchiefs, which before they were out of sight all three applied to their eyes, and even then I could distinguish Mr Swab frequently blowing his nose with his scarlet bandana.  Neither Harry nor I slept very soundly; we had too much to think about to allow \"nature's soft nurse,\" as the poet calls it, to visit our eyelids.  The boatswain's call roused up all hands.  Quickly dressing, we were on deck.  The dawn was just breaking in the eastern sky, from which direction there came a gentle breeze.  The pilot was on board, the anchor hove up, the tide was making down, sail after sail was set, and just as there was light sufficient to enable us to see our way, the brig, under a cloud of white canvas, was standing down the Mersey.  \"God bless you all!  A prosperous voyage, and a safe and happy return!\" was uttered by the pilot, as, having seen us clear of the sandbanks at the mouth of the river, he lowered himself into his boat and paddled off to his cutter, which had accompanied us.  We were now left to our own resources, and before evening we were standing down the Irish Channel with a brisk breeze on the larboard tack.    CHAPTER THREE.

Harry and I soon got our sea-legs, for although when we sailed the weather was fine, before we were well clear of the Irish Channel it began to blow fresh, and a heavy sea ran, which tumbled the vessel about not a little.  We both quickly made the acquaintance of the officers and crew, for we did not consider it beneath our dignity as supercargoes to talk to our ship mates of lower rank.  We were well repaid by the confidence they bestowed upon us, and the histories of their lives and adventures which they narrated.  Although rough in their ways, they possessed many of the best qualities in human nature.  The mates were, as I before said, good steady men, fair navigators, who could be trusted on all occasions, and had been chosen for these qualifications by Captain Magor, to whom they had long been known.  Our chief friend was Tom Tubbs, the boatswain.  Tom would have risen to a higher rank, but he was destitute of the accomplishments of reading and writing, though having to some purpose studied the book of nature, he possessed more useful knowledge than many of his fellow-men.  He, like Tom Bowling, was the darling of the crew; for although he wielded his authority with a taut hand, he could be lenient when he thought it advisable, and was ever ready to do a kind action to any of his shipmates.  He could always get them to do anything he wanted; for, instead of swearing at them, he used endearing expressions, such as \"My loves,\" \"My dear boys,\" \"My charming lads.\"  Thus, \"My darlings,\" he would sing out, \"be smart in handling that fore-topgallantsail,\" or \"Take down two reefs in the topsails, my cherubs,\" or when setting studding-sails, he would sing out, \"Haul away, my angels,\" or again, when shortening sail, \"Clew up-- haul down, my lovely dears.\"  He varied his expressions, however, according to the urgency of the case.  If more speed was required, the more endearing were his words.  I won't undertake to say that he did not sometimes rap out words of a very different signification, but that was only in extreme cases, when all others seemed to fail, or he had exhausted his vocabulary; but the men did not mind it a bit, for it only showed them that they must exert all their strength and activity if the masts were to be saved or the ship preserved from capsizing, or any other catastrophe prevented.  The men were well aware of the motive which induced him to use strong expressions.  We had two black men, who, having long served on board merchant vessels, spoke English pretty well. One of them, called Quambo, acted as steward; the other, Sambo, being ship's cook, spent a good portion of his time in the caboose, from which he carried on a conversation on either side with the men who happened to be congregated there.  He, as well as Quambo, had to do duty as a seaman, and active fellows they were, as good hands as any of the crew. Sambo, besides his other accomplishments, could play the fiddle, and in calm weather the merry tones of his instrument would set all the crew dancing, making even Tom Tubbs shuffle about out of sight of the officers; for it would have been derogatory, he considered, to have been seen thus conducting himself in public.  We had an Irishman, a Scotchman, three Finns, and a Portuguese, who was generally known as \"Portinggall.\"  The captain and the rest were Englishmen, two of whom had seen better days.  One had been a schoolmaster and the other a lawyer's clerk.  There was also a runaway from home of gentle birth, but who had so long mixed with rough characters, that not a trace of the good manners he once possessed remained by him.  We had got into the latitude of the Cape de Verde islands, and were looking out for the African coast, the wind being about east, when about two hours after noon the look-out at the masthead shouted, \"A sail in sight on the larboard bow.\"  On hearing this, the first mate, with a glass slung over his shoulder, went aloft to have a look at the stranger.  He was sometime there, and when he returned on deck I thought by his countenance that he did not like her appearance.  \"She's ship rigged, going free, and standing this way, sir,\" he said to the captain; \"and if we keep on our present course she will be within hail of us within a couple of hours at furthest.  She may be a man-of-war cruiser, or an enemy's privateer, or an honest trader; but were she that, I don't see why she should be standing this way, unless she thinks the wind will shift, and she wishes to get a good offing from Cape de Verde.  Or else she may be one of the picarooning craft which we have heard of on this coast, although it has never been my ill luck to fall in with them.\"  \"But it has been mine; and though I had the good fortune to get clear of the rascal, I never wish to meet with one of her class again; and so, in case yonder craft should be of that character, or an enemy's privateer, we shall do well to stand clear of her,\" said Captain Magor; \"and although we may lose a day or two, that will be better than running the risk of being captured or sent to the bottom.  All hands make sail--up with the helm--square away the yards.  Rig out the studding-sail booms, Mr Sherwin,\" he added, addressing the first mate as soon as the ship was before the wind.  The boatswain sounded his whistle.  \"Be smart there, my sweet lads,\" he cried out.  \"Haul away, my lovely cherubs, on the starboard studding-sail halyards.  Belay all that, my charmers;\" and so he went on whistling and shouting, until we had studding-sails extended below and aloft on either side, and both royals set, and were running along at the rate of some seven or eight knots an hour before a light breeze.  Harry and I on all occasions lent a hand when we thought we could be of use, and Tom did not fail to bestow his approving remarks upon us.  The first mate now went aloft to ascertain whether the stranger had again altered her course, or whether she was standing on as before, in which case we hoped to run her out of sight, when we could again haul on the wind.  He remained some time aloft.  When he came down he looked even grave than before.  \"It is as I feared, sir.  The fellow has clapped on all sail and is standing after us.  It is a question which has the fastest pair of heels.  If we can keep well ahead until nightfall, we may then alter our course and get clear of her.\"  \"Perhaps, after all, she is only a British man-of-war, which takes us for a slaver, or perhaps for an enemy's cruiser; for the `Arrow,' I flatter myself, doesn't look like an ordinary trader,\" observed Captain Magor.  \"That may be, sir,\" answered the mate, \"but we are doing the wisest thing to keep out of her way; and, as you said, it's better to do that and lose a day or two, than be snapped up by an enemy.\"  The captain ordered all hands to remain on deck at their stations, ready to shorten sail at a moment's notice.  I saw him frequently look astern, not so much at the stranger as at the appearance of the clouds.  \"Do you think she is coming up with us, Captain Magor?\"  I asked.  \"No doubt about that, though she is carrying less sail than we are.  She has got a stronger breeze, and I am watching lest the wind should come down on us harder than our sticks can stand.\"  A few minutes afterwards, as I moved to the fore part of the quarter-deck, where the boatswain was standing, the captain cried out, \"All hands shorten sail!\"  In an instant Tom's whistle was at his mouth, and didn't he stamp and shout.  \"In with the studding-sails, my lovely lads; let fly topgallant sheets, my sweet angels.  Haul down, trice up, my pretty boys.\"  Though what between the orders issued by the captain and mates,"]]]
