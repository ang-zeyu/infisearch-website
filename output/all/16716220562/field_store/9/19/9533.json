For pleasure hath not ceased to wait   On these expected annual rounds,   Whether the rich man's sumptuous gate   Call forth the unelaborate sounds,   Or they are offered at the door   That guard the lowliest of the poor.    How touching, when at midnight sweep   Snow-muffled winds, and all is dark,   To hear--and sink again in sleep!   Or at an earlier call, to mark,   By blazing fire, the still suspense   Of self-complacent innocence;    The mutual nod--the grave disguise   Of hearts with gladness brimming o'er,   And some unhidden tears that rise   For names once heard, and heard no more;   Tears brightened by the serenade   For infant in the cradle laid!    Ah! not for emerald fields alone,   With ambient streams more pure and bright   Than fabled Cytherea's zone   Glittering before the Thunderer's sight,   Is to my heart of hearts endeared,   The ground where we were born and reared!    Hail, ancient manners! sure defence,   Where they survive, of wholesome laws:   Remnants of love whose modest sense   Thus into narrow room withdraws;   Hail, usages of pristine mould,   And ye that guard them, Mountains old!    Bear with me, Brother! quench the thought   That slights this passion or condemns;   If thee fond fancy ever brought   From the proud margin of the Thames,   And Lambeth's venerable towers,   To humble streams and greener bowers.    Yes, they can make, who fail to find   Short leisure even in busiest days,   Moments to cast a look behind,   And profit by those kindly rays   That through the clouds do sometimes steal,   And all the far-off past reveal.    Hence, while the imperial city's din   Beats frequent on thy satiate ear,   A pleased attention I may win   To agitations less severe,   That neither overwhelm nor cloy,   But fill the hollow vale with joy!                      _William Wordsworth._     THE OLD, OLD STORY.     Listen, Lordings, unto me, a tale I will you tell,   Which, as on this night of glee, in David's town befell.   Joseph came from Nazareth, with Mary that sweet maid;   Weary were they, nigh to death; and for a lodging pray'd.   Sing high, sing high, sing low, sing low,   Sing high, sing low, sing to and fro,       Go tell it out with speed,       Cry out and shout all round about,       That Christ is born indeed.    In the inn they found no room; a scanty bed they made:   Soon a Babe from Mary's womb was in the manger laid.   Forth He came as light through glass: He came to save us all,   In the stable ox and ass before their Maker fall.                       Sing high, sing low, etc.    Shepherds lay afield that night, to keep the silly sheep,   Hosts of angels in their sight came down from heaven's high steep.   Tidings! tidings! unto you: to you a Child is born,   Purer than the drops of dew, and brighter than the morn.                       Sing high, sing low, etc.    Onward then the angels sped, the shepherds onward went,   God was in His manger bed, in worship low they bent.   In the morning see ye mind, my masters one and all,   At the altar Him to find who lay within the stall.                       Sing high, sing low, etc.                      _H. R. Bramley._     A CHRISTMAS BALLAD.     Outlanders, whence come ye last?     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   Through what green sea and great have ye past?     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    From far away, O masters mine,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   We come to bear you goodly wine:     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    From far away we come to you,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   To tell of great tidings strange and true:     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    News, news of the Trinity,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   And Mary and Joseph from over the sea:     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    For as we wandered far and wide,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   What hope do ye deem there should us betide?     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    Under a bent when the night was deep,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   There lay three shepherds tending their sheep:     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    \"O ye shepherds, what have ye seen,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   To slay your sorrow and heal your teen?\"     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    \"In an ox-stall this night we saw,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   A Babe and a maid without a flaw.     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    \"There was an old man there beside,     _The snow in the street and the wind, on the door._   His hair was white, and his hood was wide.     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    \"And as we gazed this thing upon,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   Those twain knelt down to the Little One.     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    \"And a marvellous song we straight did hear,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   That slew our sorrow and healed our care.\"     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._    News of a fair and a marvellous thing,     _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._   Nowell, nowell, nowell, we sing!     _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._                      _William Morris._     A FRENCH NOËL.  (TRANSLATED FROM GUI BARÔZAI.)     I hear along our street     Pass the minstrel throngs;   Hark! they play so sweet,     On their hautboys, Christmas songs!           Let us by the fire           Ever higher         Sing them till the night expire!    In December ring     Every day the chimes;   Loud the gleemen sing     In the streets their merry rhymes.                     Let us by the fire, etc.    Shepherds at the grange,     Where the Babe was born,   Sang, with many a change,     Christmas carols until morn.                     Let us by the fire, etc.    These good people sang     Songs devout and sweet;   While the rafters rang     There they stood with freezing feet.                     Let us by the fire, etc.    Nuns in frigid cells     At this holy tide   For want of something else     Christmas songs at times have tried.                     Let us by the fire, etc.    Washerwomen old,     To the sound they beat,   Sing by rivers cold     With uncovered heads and feet.                     Let us by the fire, etc.    Who by the fireside stands     Stamps his feet and sings;   But he who blows his hands     Not so gay a carol brings.                     Let us by the fire, etc.                      _Henry Wadsworth Longfellow._     MASTERS, IN THIS HALL.     \"To Bethl'em did they go, the shepherds three;   To Bethl'em did they go to see whe'r it were so or no,   Whether Christ were born or no       To set men free.\"        Masters, in this hall,         Hear ye news to-day       Brought over sea,         And ever I you pray.           _Nowell! Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!_             _Sing we clear!_           _Holpen are all folk on earth,_             _Born is God's Son so dear._        Going over the hills,         Through the milk-white snow,       Heard I ewes bleat         While the winds did blow.                               _Nowell, etc._        Shepherds many an one         Sat among the sheep;       No man spake more word         Than they had been asleep.                               _Nowell, etc._        Quoth I, \"Fellows mine,         Why this guise sit ye?       Making but dull cheer,         Shepherds though ye be?                               _Nowell, etc._        \"Shepherds should of right         Leap, and dance, and sing;       Thus to see you sit         Is a right strange thing.\"                               _Nowell, etc._        Quoth these fellows three,         \"To Bethl'em town we go,       To see a Mighty Lord         Lie in manger low.\"                               _Nowell, etc._        \"How name ye this Lord,         Shepherds?\" then said I.       \"Very God,\" they said,         \"Come from Heaven high.\"                               _Nowell, etc._        Then to Bethl'em town         We went two and two,       And in a sorry place         Heard the oxen low.                               _Nowell, etc._        Therein did we see         A sweet and goodly May,       And a fair old man;         Upon the straw she lay.                               _Nowell, etc._        And a little Child         On her arm had she;       \"Wot ye who is this?\"         Said the hinds to me.                               _Nowell, etc._        Ox and ass Him know,         Kneeling on their knee:       Wondrous joy had I         This little Babe to see.                               _Nowell, etc._        This is Christ the Lord:         Masters, be ye glad!       Christmas is come in,         And no folk should be sad.                               _Nowell, etc._                      _William Morris._     _The Worship Of The Babe._     \"Rejoice, our Saviour He was born   On Christmas day in the morning.\"                      _Old Carol._     TO HIS SAVIOUR, A CHILD; A PRESENT, BY A CHILD.     Go, pretty child, and bear this flower   Unto thy little Saviour;   And tell Him by that bud now blown,   He is a Rose of Sharon known.   When thou hast said so, stick it there   Upon His bib or stomacher;   And tell Him, for good handsel too,   That thou hast brought a whistle new,   Made of a clean, strait oaten reed   To charm His cries at time of need.   Tell Him for coral thou hast none,   But if thou had'st He should have one;   But poor thou art, and known to be   Even as moneyless as He.

Yet if his majesty our sovereign lord   Should of his own accord   Friendly himself invite,   And say, \"I'll be your guest to-morrow night,\"   How should we stir ourselves, call and command   All hands to work: \"Let no man idle stand.   Set me fine Spanish tables in the hall,   See they be fitted all;   Let there be room to eat,   And order taken that there want no meat.   See every sconce and candlestick made bright,   That without tapers they may give a light.   Look to the presence; are the carpets spread,   The dais o'er the head,   The cushions in the chairs,   And all the candles lighted on the stairs?   Perfume the chambers, and in any case   Let each man give attendance in his place.\"   Thus if the king were coming would we do,   And 'twere good reason too;   For 'tis a duteous thing   To show all honor to an earthly king,   And after all our travail and our cost,   So he be pleased, to think no labor lost.   But at the coming of the King of Heaven,   All's set at six and seven:   We wallow in our sin,   Christ cannot find a chamber in the inn.   We entertain Him always like a stranger,   And, as at first, still lodge Him in the manger.                      _Christ Church, Oxford, MS._     NEW PRINCE, NEW POMP.     Behold a silly, tender Babe,     In freezing winter night,   In homely manger trembling lies;     Alas! a piteous sight.    The inns are full, no man will yield     This little pilgrim bed;   But forced He is with silly beasts     In crib to shroud His head.    Despise Him not for lying there,     First what He is inquire;   An orient pearl is often found     In depth of dirty mire.    Weigh not His crib, His wooden dish,     Nor beast that by Him feed;   Weigh not His mother's poor attire,     Nor Joseph's simple weed.    This stable is a prince's court,     This crib His chair of state;   The beasts are parcel of His pomp,     The wooden dish His plate.    The persons in that poor attire     His royal liveries wear;   The Prince himself is come from heaven,     This pomp is praiséd there.    With joy approach, O Christian wight!     Do homage to thy King;   And highly praise this humble pomp     Which He from heaven doth bring.                      _Robert Southwell._     OF THE EPIPHANY.     Fair eastern star, that art ordained to run   Before the sages, to the rising sun,   Here cease thy course, and wonder that the cloud   Of this poor stable can thy Maker shroud:   Ye heavenly bodies glory to be bright,   And are esteemed as ye are rich in light;   But here on earth is taught a different way,   Since under this low roof the Highest lay.   Jerusalem erects her stately towers,   Displays her windows and adorns her bowers;   Yet there thou must not cast a trembling spark,   Let Herod's palace still continue dark;   Each school and synagogue thy force repels,   There pride enthroned in misty error dwells;   The temple, where the priests maintain their quire,   Shall taste no beam of thy celestial fire,   While this weak cottage all thy splendor takes:   A joyful gate of every chink it makes.   Here shines no golden roof, no ivory stair,   No king exalted in a stately chair,   Girt with attendants, or by heralds styled,   But straw and hay enwrap a speechless child.   Yet Sabæ's lords before this babe unfold   Their treasures, offering incense, myrrh, and gold.   The crib becomes an altar; therefore dies   No ox nor sheep; for in their fodder lies   The Prince of Peace, who, thankful for His bed,   Destroys those rites in which their blood was shed:   The quintessence of earth He takes, and fees,   And precious gums distilled from weeping trees;   Rich metals and sweet odors now declare   The glorious blessings which His laws prepare,   To clear us from the base and loathsome flood   Of sense and make us fit for angel's food,   Who lift to God for us the holy smoke   Of fervent prayers with which we Him invoke,   And try our actions in the searching fire   By which the seraphims our lips inspire:   No muddy dross pure minerals shall infect,   We shall exhale our vapors up direct:   No storm shall cross, nor glittering lights deface   Perpetual sighs which seek a happy place.                      _Sir John Beaumont._     A HYMN FOR THE EPIPHANY.  SUNG AS BY THE THREE KINGS.     _1 King._ Bright Babe! whose awful beauties make             The morn incur a sweet mistake;   _2 King._ For whom the officious heavens devise             To disinherit the sun's rise;   _3 King._ Delicately to displace             The day, and plant it fairer in Thy face;   _1 King._ O Thou born King of loves!   _2 King._ Of lights!   _3 King._ Of joys!    _Chorus._ Look up, sweet Babe, look up and see!             For love of Thee,             Thus far from home             The East is come             To seek herself in Thy sweet eyes.    _1 King._ We who strangely went astray,             Lost in a bright             Meridian night;   _2 King._ A darkness made of too much day;   _3 King._ Beckoned from far             By Thy fair star,             Lo, at last have found our way.    _Chorus._ To Thee, Thou Day of Night! Thou East of West!             Lo, we at last have found the way             To Thee, the world's great universal East,             The general and indifferent day.    _1 King._ All-circling point! all-centring sphere!             The world's one round eternal year:   _2 King._ Whose full and all-unwrinkled face             Nor sinks nor swells with time or place;   _3 King._ But everywhere and every while             Is one consistent solid smile,   _1 King._ Not vexed and tost,   _2 King._ 'Twixt spring and frost;   _3 King._ Nor by alternate shreds of light;             Sordidly shifting hands with shades and night.    _Chorus._ O little All, in Thy embrace,             The world lies warm and likes his place;             Nor does his full globe fail to be             Kissed on both his cheeks by Thee;             Time is too narrow for Thy year,             Nor makes the whole world Thy half-sphere.                      _Richard Crashaw._     A HYMN ON THE NATIVITY OF MY SAVIOUR.     I sing the birth was born to-night,   The author both of life and light;     The angels so did sound it.   And like the ravished shepherds said,   Who saw the light, and were afraid,     Yet searched, and true they found it.    The Son of God th' eternal king,   That did us all salvation bring,     And freed the soul from danger;   He whom the whole world could not take,   The Word, which heaven and earth did make,     Was now laid in a manger.    The Father's wisdom willed it so,   The Son's obedience knew no No,     Both wills were in one stature;   And as that wisdom had decreed,   The Word was now made flesh indeed,     And took on Him our nature.    What comfort by Him do we win,   Who made himself the price of sin,     To make us heirs of glory!   To see this babe all innocence;   A martyr born in our defence;     Can man forget the story?                      _Ben Jonson._     AT CHRISTMAS.     All after pleasures as I rid one day,     My horse and I both tried, body and mind,     With full cry of affections quite astray,   I took up in the next inn I could find.    There, when I came, whom found I but my dear--     My dearest Lord; expecting till the grief     Of pleasures brought me to Him; ready there   To be all passengers' most sweet relief?    O Thou, whose glorious, yet contracted light,     Wrapt in night's mantle, stole into a manger;     Since my dark soul and brutish is Thy right,   To man, of all beasts, be not Thou a stranger;    Furnish and deck my soul, that Thou may'st have   A better lodging than a rock or grave.    The shepherds sing; and shall I silent be?           My God, no hymn for Thee?   My soul's a shepherd too; a flock it feeds           Of thoughts and words and deeds;   The pasture is Thy word, the stream Thy grace,           Enriching every place.    Shepherd and flock shall sing, and all my powers           Outsing the daylight hours.   Then we will chide the sun for letting night           Take up his place and right:   We sing one common Lord; wherefore He should           Himself the candle hold.    I will go searching till I find a sun           Shall stay till we have done;   A willing shiner, that shall shine as gladly           As frost-nipt suns look sadly,   Then we will sing and shine all our own day,           And one another pay.    His beams shall cheer my breast; and both so twine,   Till ev'n his beams sing and my music shine.                      _George Herbert._     NEW HEAVEN, NEW WAR.     Come to your heaven, you heavenly quires!   Earth hath the heaven of your desires;   Remove your dwelling to your God,   A stall is now His blest abode;   Sith men their homage do deny,   Come, angels, all their fault supply.    This little Babe, so few days old,   Is come to rifle Satan's fold;   All hell doth at His presence quake,   Though He himself for cold do shake;   For in this weak, unarméd wise   The gates of hell He will surprise.    My soul, with Christ join thou in fight;   Stick to the tents that He hath pight;   Within His crib is surest ward,   This little Babe will be thy guard;   If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy,   Then flit not from this heavenly Boy.                      _Robert Southwell._     FOR CHRISTMAS DAY.       Rejoice, rejoice, with heart and voice!     In Christé's birth this day rejoice!   From Virgin's womb this day did spring   The precious seed that only savéd man;   This day let man rejoice and sweetly sing,   Since on this day salvation first began.     This day did Christ man's soul from death remove,     With glorious saints to dwell in heaven above.    This day to man came pledge of perfect peace,   This day to man came perfect unity,   This day man's grief began for to surcease,   This day did man receive a remedy     For each offence and"]]]
