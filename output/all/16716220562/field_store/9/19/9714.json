There are four groups of these stories: seven about a school called Parkhurst, detailing major events such as matches and boat races.  The second section consists of eleven discourses on different types of boy, such as \"The Sneak\".  The third section contains twelve stories about boys who have played their part in English History, such as the two young \"Princes in the Tower\", Dick Whittington, Edward the Sixth, and so on.  The final section consists of seven general stories of greater length than the foregoing.  The whole book, though not really long, is quite amusing, though of course very dated.  You'll enjoy it.  I personally prefer to listen to these books.

MY FIRST FOOTBALL MATCH.  It was a proud moment in my existence when Wright, captain of our football club, came up to me in school one Friday and said, \"Adams, your name is down to play in the match against Craven to-morrow.\"  I could have knighted him on the spot.  To be one of the picked \"fifteen,\" whose glory it was to fight the battles of their school in the Great Close, had been the leading ambition of my life--I suppose I ought to be ashamed to confess it--ever since, as a little chap of ten, I entered Parkhurst six years ago.  Not a winter Saturday but had seen me either looking on at some big match, or oftener still scrimmaging about with a score or so of other juniors in a scratch game.  But for a long time, do what I would, I always seemed as far as ever from the coveted goal, and was half despairing of ever rising to win my \"first fifteen cap.\"  Latterly, however, I had noticed Wright and a few others of our best players more than once lounging about in the Little Close, where we juniors used to play, evidently taking observations with an eye to business.  Under the awful gaze of these heroes, need I say I exerted myself as I had never done before?  What cared I for hacks or bruises, so only that I could distinguish myself in their eyes?  And never was music sweeter than the occasional \"Bravo, young 'un!\" with which some of them would applaud any special feat of skill or daring.  So I knew my time was coming at last, and only hoped it would arrive before the day of the Craven match, the great match of our season-- always looked forward to as _the_ event of the Christmas term, when victory was regarded by us boys as the summit of all human glory, and defeat as an overwhelming disgrace.  It will therefore be understood why I was almost beside myself with delight when, the very day before the match, Wright made the announcement I have referred to.  I scarcely slept a wink that night for dreaming of the wonderful exploits which were to signalise my first appearance in the Great Close--how I was to run the ball from one end of the field to the other, overturning, dodging, and distancing every one of the enemy, finishing up with a brilliant and mighty kick over the goal.  After which I was to have my broken limbs set by a doctor on the spot, to receive a perfect ovation from friend and foe, to be chaired round the field, to be the \"lion\" at the supper afterwards, and finally to have a whole column of the _Times_ devoted to my exploits!  What glorious creatures we are in our dreams!  Well, the eventful day dawned at last.  It was a holiday at Parkhurst, and as fine a day as any one could wish.  As I made my appearance, wearing the blue-and-red jersey of a \"first fifteen man\" under my jacket, I found myself quite an object of veneration among the juniors who had lately been my compeers, and I accepted their homage with a vast amount of condescension.  Nothing was talked of during the forenoon but the coming match.  Would the Craven fellows turn up a strong team?  Would that fellow Slider, who made the tremendous run last year, play for them again this?  Would Wright select the chapel end or the other, if we won the choice?  How were we off behind the scrimmage?  \"Is Adams to be trusted?\"  I heard one voice ask.  Two or three small boys promptly replied, \"Yes\"; but the seniors said nothing, except Wright, who took the opportunity of giving me a little good advice in private.  \"Look here, Adams; you are to play half-back, you know.  All you've got to take care of is to keep cool, and never let your eyes go off the ball.  You know all the rest.\"  A lecture half an hour long could not have made more impression.  I remembered those two hints, \"Keep cool, and watch the ball,\" as long as I played football, and I would advise every half-back to take them to heart in like manner.  At noon the Craven team came down in an omnibus, and had lunch in hall with us, and half an hour later found us all in a straggling procession, making for the scene of conflict in the Great Close.  There stood the goals and the boundary-posts, and there was Granger, the ground-keeper, with a brand-new lemon-shaped ball under his arm.  \"Look sharp and peel!\" cried our captain.  So we hurried to the tent, and promptly divested ourselves of our outer garments, turned up the sleeves of our jerseys, and tied an extra knot in our bootlaces.  As we emerged, the Craven men were making their appearance on the ground in battle array.  I felt so nervous myself that I could not, for the life of me, imagine how some of them could look so unconcerned, whistling, and actually playing leapfrog to keep themselves warm!  An officer in the Crimean War once described his sensation in some of the battles there as precisely similar to those he had experienced when a boy on the football field at Rugby.  I can appreciate the comparison, for one.  Certainly never soldier went into action with a more solemn do-or-die feeling than that with which I took my place on the field that afternoon.  \"They've won the choice of sides,\" said somebody, \"and are going to play with the wind.\"  \"Take your places, Parkhurst!\" shouted our captain.  The ball lies in the centre of the ground, and Wright stands ten yards or so behind it, ready for the kick-off.  Of our fifteen the ten forwards are extended in a line with the ball across the field, ready to charge after it the moment it goes flying.  The two best runners of our team are stationed quarter-back, where they can skirmish on the outskirts of the scrimmage.  I am posted a little in rear of them at half-back--an unusual post for so young a player, but one which was accorded to me by virtue of my light weight and not inconsiderable running powers.  Behind me are the two backs, on whom, when all else fails, the issue of the conflict depends.  The Craven players are similarly disposed, and waiting impatiently for our captain's kick.  \"Are you ready?\" he shouts.  Silence gives consent.  He gives a quick glance round at us, then springs forward, and in an instant the ball is soaring high in the direction of the Cravens' goal amid the shouts of onlooking friend and foe.  Our forwards were after it like lightning, but not before a Craven back had got hold of it and run some distance in the direction of our goal. He did not wait to be attacked, but by a clever drop-kick, a knack peculiar to all good backs, sent it spinning right over the forwards' heads into the hands of one of our quarter-backs.  He, tucking it under his arm and crushing his cap on to his head, started to run.  Going slowly at first, he steered straight for the forwards of the enemy till within a pace or two of them, when he doubled suddenly, and amid the shouts of our partisans slipped past them and was seen heading straight for the Craven goal.  But although he had escaped their forwards, he had yet their rearguard to escape, which was far harder work, for was not one of that rearguard the celebrated Slider himself, who by his prowess had last year carried defeat to our school; and the other, was it not the stalwart Naylor, who only a month ago had played gloriously for his county against Gravelshire?  Yet our man was not to be daunted by the prestige of these distinguished adversaries, but held on his way pluckily, and without a swerve.  It was a sight to see those two cunningly lay wait for him, like two spiders for a fly.  There was nothing for it but to plunge headlong into their web in a desperate effort to break through.  Alas! brave man!  Naylor has him in his clutches, the Craven forwards come like a deluge on the spot, our forwards pour over the Craven, and in an instant our hero and the ball have vanished from sight under a heap of writhing humanity.  \"Down!\" cries a half-choked voice, from the bottom of the heap.  It was rather an unnecessary observation, as it happens, but it served as a signal to both parties to rise to their feet and prepare for a \"scrimmage.\"  Now, if truth must be told, our school always had the reputation of being second to none in \"going through a scrimmage,\" so while the players are scrambling to their feet, and waiting for the ball to be \"grounded,\" I will explain what our method of doing the thing was.  It was nothing more nor less than a carrying out of the principle of the wedge.  The ball formed the apex; the fellows got up close to it, so as never to let it out of reach of their four feet.  Behind these two came three with locked arms, and behind the three, four.  The men in the middle pushed straight ahead, and those at the sides inwards towards the ball, while the two or three remaining forwards lent their weight to one side or other of the base, according as the exigencies of the scrimmage demanded.  Thus our wedge, embodying a concentrated pressure in the direction of the ball, the farther it advanced the farther it scattered asunder the foe,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],["title","Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#1)"],["body","fell off from its gradually widening sides without hope of getting again within reach of the ball except by retreating to the rear and beginning the struggle over afresh.  When this manoeuvre was well executed, it was almost certain to carry the ball through the scrimmage, and when that happened, then was the time for us half and quarter-backs to look out for our chance.  Our men went at it with their customary vigour and address, and presently the ball emerged on the far side of the scrimmage.  In an instant it was caught up by one of the Craven quarter-backs, and in an instant our men were upon him again before he could get a start for a run.  Scrimmage after scrimmage ensued, the ball was constantly in Chancery, but each crush brought us a yard or so nearer the enemy's goal than we had been before.  All this time I was little better than a spectator, for the ball never once came within reach of my fingers, and I was beginning to think that, after all, a big match was not so exciting a thing as one is apt to imagine.  At last, however, after one scrimmage more desperate than any that had gone before, the ball flew out suddenly, and bounded off one of the Craven men into my grasp.  Now was my chance.  \"If only I could--\"  The next thing I was conscious of was that about twenty people had fallen to the ground all of a heap, and that I and the ball were at the bottom.  \"Down!\"  I cried.  \"Pack up there, Parkhurst!\" sang out Wright.  I extricated myself as quickly as I could, and got back to my place in the rear, thinking to myself, after all, there _was_ some little excitement in football.  At last the ball got well away from the scrimmage, and who should secure it but the redoubtable Slider!  I felt a passing tremor of deep despair, as I saw that hero spring like the wind towards our goal.  \"Look out, Adams!\" shouted Wright.  Sure enough he was coming in my direction!  With the desperation of a doomed man I strode out to meet him.  He rushed furiously on--swerving slightly to avoid my reach, and stretching out his arm to ward off my grasp.  I flung myself wildly in his path.  There was a heavy thud, and the earth seemed to jump up and strike me.  The next moment I was sprawling on my back on the grass.  I don't pretend to know how it all happened, but somehow or other I had succeeded in checking the onward career of the victorious Slider; for though I had fallen half stunned before the force of his charge, he had recoiled for an instant from the same shock, and that instant gave time for Wright to get hold of him, and so put an end for the time to his progress.  \"Well played!\" said some one, as I picked myself up.  So I was comforted, and began to think that, after all, football was rather a fine game.  Time would fail me to tell of all the events of that afternoon--how Wright carried the ball within a dozen yards of our opponents' goal; how their forwards passed the ball one to another, and got a \"touch-down\" behind our line, but missed the kick; how Naylor ran twenty yards with one of our men hanging on his back; how our quarter-back sent the ball nearly over their goal with as neat a drop-kick as ever it has been my lot to witness.  The afternoon was wearing.  I heard the time-keeper call out, \"Five minutes more!\"  The partisans of either side were getting frantic with excitement.  Unless we could secure an advantage now, we should be as good as defeated, for the Craven had scored a \"touch-down\" to our nothing.  Was this desperate fight to end so?  Was victory, after all, to escape us?  But I had no time for reflection then.  \"Now, Parkhurst,\" sang out Wright, \"pull yourselves together for once!\"  A Craven man is standing to throw the ball out of \"touch,\" and either side stands in confronting rows, impatient for the fray.  Wright is at the end of the line, face to face with Naylor, and I am a little behind Wright.  \"Keep close!\" exclaims the latter to me, as the ball flies towards us.  Wright has it, but in an instant Naylor's long arms are round him, bearing him down.  \"Adams!\" ejaculates out captain, and in a trice he passes the ball into my hands, and I am off like the wind.  So suddenly has it all been done that I have already a yard or two start before my flight is discovered. There is a yelling and a rush behind me; there is a roar from the crowds on either side; there is a clear \"Follow up, Parkhurst!\" from Wright in the rear; there is a loud \"Collar him!\" from the Craven captain ahead. I am steering straight for their goal; three men only are between me and it--one, their captain, right back, and Slider and another man in front of him.  I see at a glance that my only hope is to keep as I am going and waste no time in dodging, or assuredly the pursuing host will be upon me. Slider and his companion are closing in right across my path, almost close together.  With a bound I dash between them.  Have they got me, or have I escaped them?  A shout louder than ever and a \"Bravo!\" from Wright tell me I am clear of that danger, and have now but their last defence to pass.  He is a tall, broad fellow, and a formidable foe to encounter, and waits for me close under their goal.  The pace, I feel, is telling on me; the shouting behind sounds nearer, only a few yards divides us now.  Shall I double, shall I venture a kick, or shall I charge straight at him?  \"Charge at him!\" sounds Wright's voice, as if in answer to my thought. I gather up all my remaining force, and charge.  There is a flash across my eyes, and a dull shock against my chest.  I reel and stagger, and forget where I am.  I am being swept along in a torrent; the waters with a roar rush past me and over me.  Every moment I get nearer and nearer the fatal edge--I am at it--I hang a moment on the brink, and then--  \"Down!\" shouts a voice close at my ear, and there is such a noise of cheering and rejoicing that I sit up and rub my eyes like one waking bewildered from a strange dream.  Then I find out what has happened.  When I charged at the Craven captain the shock sent me back staggering into the very arms of Wright and our forwards, who were close at my heels, and who then, in a splendid and irresistible rush, carried me and the ball and the half of the other side along with them right behind the enemy's goal-line, where we fall _en masse_ to the earth--I, with the ball under me, being at the bottom.  Even if I had been hurt--which I was not--there was no time to be wasted on condolences or congratulations.  The time-keeper held his watch in his hand, and our goal must be kicked at once, if it was to be kicked at all.  So the fifteen paces out were measured, the \"nick\" for the ball was carefully made, the enemy stood along their goal-line ready to spring the moment the ball should touch the earth.  Wright, cool and self-possessed, placed himself in readiness a yard or two behind the ball, which one of our side held an inch off the ground.  An anxious moment of expectation followed; then came a sharp \"Now!\" from our captain.  The ball was placed cunningly in the nick, the Craven forwards rushed out on it in a body, but long before they could reach it, Wright's practised foot had sent it flying straight as an arrow over the bar, and my first football match had ended in a glorious victory for the Old School.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The terms used here describe the Rugby game as it used to be played prior to 1880.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE PARKHURST PAPER-CHASE.  \"The meet is to be at one o'clock, sharp, in the Dean's Warren--don't forget!\"  So said Forwood, the \"whipper-in\" of the Parkhurst Hare and Hounds Club, to me, one March morning in the year 18--.  I had no need to be reminded of the appointment; for this was the day of the \"great hunt\" of the year, always held by the running set at Parkhurst School to yield in interest to no other fixture of the athletic calendar.  In fine weather, and over good country, a paper-chase is one of the grandest sports ever indulged in--at least, so we thought when we were boys--and the \"great hunt\" was, of course, the grandest run of the year, and looked forward to, consequently, with the utmost eagerness by all lovers of running in our school.  This year, too, I had a special interest in the event, for it was my turn to run \"hare\"--in other words, to be, with another fellow, the object of the united pursuit of some twenty or thirty of my schoolfellows, who would glory in running me down not a whit less than I should glory in escaping them.  For some weeks previously we had been taking short trial runs, to test our pace and powers of endurance; and Birch (my fellow-\"hare\") and I had more than once surveyed the course we proposed to take on the occasion of the \"great hunt,\" making ourselves, as far as possible, acquainted with the bearings of several streams, ploughed fields, and high walls to be avoided, and the whereabouts of certain gaps, woods, and hollows to be desired.  We were glad afterwards that we had taken this precaution, as the reader will see.  I can't say if the Parkhurst method of conducting our \"hunts\" was the orthodox one; I know _we_ considered it was, as our rules were our own making, or rather a legacy left to us by a former generation of runners at the school.  We were to take, in all, a twelve miles' course, of nearly an oval shape, six miles out and six miles home.  Any amount of dodging or doubling was to be allowed to us hares, except crossing our own path. We were to get five minutes' clear start, and, of course, were expected to drop our paper \"scent\" wherever we went.  Luckily for me, Birch was an old hand at running hare, and up to all sorts of dodges, so that I knew all it was needful for me to do was to husband my \"wind,\" and run evenly with him, leaving him to shape our course and regulate our pace.  It was a lively scene at the Dean's Warren, when we reached it a few minutes before the appointed time that afternoon.  The \"pack\"--that "]]]
