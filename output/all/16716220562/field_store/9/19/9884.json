About daybreak Johnson came and told him that the Moors were asleep.  The awful crisis had now arrived; a cold perspiration stood on his brow as he thought of the dreadful alternative and reflected that one way or the other his fate must be decided in the course of the day. To deliberate was to lose the only chance of escape; so, taking up his bundle, he stepped gently over the negroes sleeping in the air, mounted his horse, bade Johnson farewell, desiring him to take particular care of the papers with which he had intrusted him, and to say that he had left him in good health, on his way to Bambarra.  He rode on, expecting every moment to be overtaken by the Moorish horsemen.  Some shepherds he encountered followed, hooting and throwing stones at him.  Scarcely was he out of their reach, and was again indulging in the hopes of escaping, when he heard somebody call behind him, and on looking back, he saw three Moors on horseback galloping at full speed and brandishing their weapons.  To escape was vain.  He stopped, and one of them, presenting his musket, told him that he must go back to Ali.  The effect of this announcement was to benumb his faculties.  He rode back with apparent unconcern, but he had not gone far when the Moors, stopping, ordered him to untie his bundle.  Having examined the articles, they found nothing worth taking except his cloak, and one of them, pulling it off, wrapped it about himself.  It had served to protect him from the rain in the day and the dews at night, and was of the greatest value to him.  He earnestly begged the robbers to return it, but his petition was unheeded.  As he attempted to follow them to regain his cloak, one of the robbers struck his horse over the head, and presenting his musket, ordered him to proceed no further. Finding that the sole object of the Moors had been to plunder him, he turned his horse's head towards the east, thankful to have escaped with his life.  As soon as he was out of sight of the robbers, he struck into the woods and pushed on with all possible speed.  He had at length obtained his liberty--his limbs felt light, even the desert looked pleasant.  He soon recollected, however, that he had no means of procuring food, nor a prospect of finding water.  He directed his course by compass in the hopes of at length reaching some town or village in the kingdom of Bambarra.  His thirst, in consequence of the burning heat of the sun, reflected with double violence on the sand, became intense.  He climbed a tree in the hopes of seeing some human habitation.  Nothing appeared around but thick underwood and hillocks of white sand.  At sunset he again climbed a tree, but the same sight met his eyes. Descending, after taking the saddle off his horse's back, he was suddenly seized with giddiness, and fell to the ground believing that the hour of death was fast approaching.  He recovered, however, just as the sun was sinking behind the trees, and now, summoning up all his resolution, he determined to make another effort to prolong his existence.  He had gone on some distance further when he perceived some lightening in the north-east, a delightful sight, for it promised rain, and soon he heard the wind roaring among the bushes.  He was expecting the refreshing drops, when in an instant he was covered with a cloud of sand.  It continued to fly for nearly an hour; then more lightening followed and then down came a few heavy drops of rain, enabling him to quench his thirst by wringing and sucking his clothes.  He travelled on during the night, which was intensely dark, till he perceived a light ahead.  Cautiously approaching it he heard the lowing of cattle and the clamorous tongues of the herdsmen, which made him suspect that it was a watering-place belonging to the Moors.  Rather than run the risk of falling into their hands he retreated, but being dreadfully thirsty, and fearing the approach of the burning day, he thought it prudent to search for the wells which he expected to find at no great distance.  While thus engaged he was perceived by a woman, who screaming out, two people ran to her assistance from the neighbouring tents and passed close to him.  Happily he escaped from them and, plunging again into the woods, after proceeding a mile he heard a loud and confused noise.  Great was his delight to find that it arose from the croaking of frogs, which was music to his ears.  At daybreak he reached some shallow pools full of large frogs, which so frightened his horse that he was obliged to keep them quiet by beating the water till he had drank.  Having quenched his own thirst, he ascended a tree to ascertain the best course to take, when he observed a pillar of smoke about twelve miles off.  Directing his course to it he reached a Foulah village belonging to Ali.  Hunger compelled him to enter it, but he was denied admittance to the _dooty's_ house, and could not obtain even a handful of corn.  Reaching, however, a humble hut at which an old motherly-looking woman sat spinning cotton, he made signs that he was hungry.  She immediately laid down her distaff, and desired him in Arabic to come in, setting before him a dish of _kous-kous_.  In return he gave her one of his pocket-handkerchiefs, and asked for a little corn for his horse, which she readily brought him.  While his horse was feeding the people collected round him, and from their conversation he discovered that they proposed seizing him and conveying him back to Ali.  He therefore tied up his corn and, lest it might be supposed that he was running from the Moors, driving his horse before him he took a northerly direction, followed by the boys and girls of the town.  Having got rid of his troublesome attendants he struck into the woods, where he was compelled to pass the night with his saddle for a pillow.  He was awakened by three Foulahs, who, taking him for a Moor, told him that it was time to pray.  Without answering them he saddled his horse and made his escape.  The next day he took shelter in the tent of a Foulah shepherd, who charitably gave him boiled corn and dates, although he was recognised as a Christian.  He here purchased some corn in exchange for some brass buttons, and again took the road to Bambarra, which he resolved to follow for the night.  Hearing some people approaching, he thought it prudent to hide himself, which he did in the thick brushwood.  He there sat holding his horse by the nose to prevent him neighing, equally afraid of the natives without and the wild beasts within the forest. The former took their departure, and he went on till past midnight, when the croaking of frogs induced him to turn off from the road, that he and his steed might quench their thirst.  Having discovered an open place with a single tree in the midst of it, he lay down for the night.  He was disturbed towards morning by the sound of wolves, which made him once more mount.  On the morning of the 5th of July he reached a negro town in the confines of Bambarra.  It was a small place surrounded by high walls, inhabited by a mixture of Mandingoes and Foulahs, chiefly employed in the cultivation of corn.  The people were suspicious of his character, some supposing him to be an Arab, others a Moorish sultan, but the _dooty_, or chief magistrate, who had been at Gambia, took his part, and assured them that he was a white man.  On its being reported that he was going to Sego, the capital, several women came and begged that he would enquire of Mansong what had become of their children, who had been carried off to fight.  He was allowed to take his departure without molestation, and on the 6th reached the town of Dingyee.  When he was about to depart the next morning, the landlord begged him to give him a lock of his hair, understanding that white men's hair made a _saphie_, or charm, which would bestow on the possessor all their knowledge.  This he willingly promised to do, but the landlord's thirst for learning was such that he cropped nearly the whole of one side of his head, and would have done the same with the other had not Park told him that he wished to reserve some of this precious merchandise for a future occasion.  Having reached the town of Wassiboo, shortly afterwards eight fugitive Kaartan negroes, who had escaped from the tyrannical government of the Moors, arrived, on their road to offer their allegiance to the king of Bambarra.  Park gladly accepted their invitation to accompany them on their road.  His horse at the end of three days, becoming completely knocked up, he dismounted and desired his companions to ride on, telling them he would follow; but they declined leaving him, declaring that lions were numerous, and that, though they would not attack a body of people, they would soon find out a single individual and destroy him.  One of the party, therefore, insisted on remaining with him, and he and his friend, after he had rested, overtook their companions, passing through several of the numerous towns in this part of the country.  His horse, now becoming weaker and weaker, he was obliged to drive the animal on before him the greater part of the day, so that he did not reach Geosorro till late in the evening.  The _dooty_ of the place refused to give him or his companions food, so he lay down supperless to sleep.  Their host, however, relented, and about midnight he was awakened with the joyful information that victuals were prepared.  Next day his fellow-travellers, having better horses, went on ahead, and he was walking barefoot, driving his own poor animal before him, when he met a coffle, or caravan, of about seventy slaves coming from Sego. They were tied together by their necks with thongs of bullock's hide twisted like a rope, seven slaves upon a thong, and a man with a musket between every seven.  They were bound for Morocco.  On arriving at the next place he found that his companions had gone on without him, but he fell in, the following"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],["title","Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#5)"],["body","y, with two negroes going to Sego, who afforded him their company.  In the village through which he passed he was constantly taken for a Moor.  The people jeered at him, laughing at his tattered and forlorn appearance.  He, however, again overtook the Kaartans, who promised to introduce him to the king.  As they were riding along over some marshy ground, and he was anxiously looking around for the river which he now supposed to be near, one of his companions called out, \"_Geo affilli_!\"  (\"See water!\") and, looking forward, he saw with infinite pleasure the great object of his mission-- the long-sought-for majestic Niger, glittering in the morning sun, as broad as the Thames at Westminster, and flowing slowly to the east.  He hastened to the brink, and having drunk of the water, offered up his fervent thanks in prayer to the Great Ruler of all things for having thus far crowned his endeavours with success.  Sego, the capital of Bambarra--at which he had now arrived--consists, properly speaking, of four distinct towns: two on the north and two on the south bank of the Niger.  They are surrounded by high mud walls. The houses are built of clay, of a square form with flat roofs--some of them of two stories, and many of them are whitewashed.  Moorish mosques are seen in every quarter; and the streets, though narrow, are broad enough for every useful purpose in a country where wheel-carriages are unknown.  It contains about thirty thousand inhabitants.  While waiting to cross the river, a messenger arrived, informing him that the king could not possibly see him until he knew what had brought him into the country, and that he must not venture to cross the river without his majesty's permission.  He was directed to pass the night in a distant village; but when he reached it, no one would admit him.  He was regarded with astonishment and fear, and was obliged to sit all day without food in the shade of a tree.  He fully expected to have to pass the night in the same place; but about sunset, after he had turned his horse loose, a woman, perceiving that he was weary and dejected, enquired into his situation.  Casting looks of pity upon him, she took up his saddle and bridle, and told him to follow her.  Having conducted him into her hut, she lighted her lamp, spread a mat on the floor and signified that he might remain there for the night.  Finding that he was very hungry, she brought him a fine fish for supper.  Having thus attended to the stranger, telling him that he might sleep in safety she called her women around her and desired them to resume their task of spinning cotton, in which they continued to employ themselves the greater part of the night, lightening their labours by songs, some of which had reference to their white visitor.  Several days passed, when a messenger arrived from Mansong with a bag in his hands.  He told Park that it was his Majesty's pleasure he should forthwith depart from the neighbourhood of Sego, but that the king, wishing to relieve a white man in distress, had sent him five thousand cowries.  From the conversation Park had with the guide, he ascertained that Mansong would willingly have seen him, but that he was apprehensive of being unable to protect him against the blind and inveterate malice of the Moorish inhabitants.  His conduct, therefore, was at once prudent and liberal.  He was the same evening conducted to a village about seven miles to the eastward, where he was well received.  His guide told him that if Jenne was really the place of his destination, the journey was one of greater danger than he might suppose; for, although that town was nominally a part of the King of Bambarra's dominions, it was in fact a city of the Moors--the chief part of the inhabitants being Bushreens, a fanatical Mahommedan sect.  He heard, too, that Timbuctoo, the great object of his search, was entirely in possession of that savage and merciless people, who allow no Christian to live there.  He had, however, advanced too far to think of returning with uncertain information, and he determined to proceed.  Being provided with a guide, he left the village on the morning of the 24th, travelling through a highly cultivated country, the scenery bearing a greater resemblance to that of England than he had expected to find in the middle of Africa.  The people were everywhere employed in collecting the fruit of the shea trees, from which they prepared vegetable butter.  In the evening he reached the large town of Sansanding, the resort of numerous Moorish caravans from the shores of the Mediterranean.  In the harbour he observed twenty large canoes, and others arrived while he was there.  He was received into the house of the _dooty_, Counti Mamadi.  Scarcely had he arrived when hundreds of people surrounded him, all speaking different dialects, several of them declaring that they had seen him in various parts of the continent.  It was evident that they mistook him for somebody else.  One of them, a _shereef_, from Suat, declared that if he refused to go to the mosque he would carry him there.  He had little doubt that the Moor would have put his threat into execution had not his host interposed in his behalf.  The latter said that, if he would let his guest alone for the night, in the morning he should be sent about his business.  This somewhat appeased them, but even after he had retired to his hut the people climbed over the pailings to look at him.  At midnight, when the Moors had retired, Mamadi paid him a visit and earnestly desired him to write a _saphie_, or charm, observing, \"If a Moor's _saphie_ is good, a white man's must needs be better.\"  Park readily furnished him with one, which was in reality the Lord's Prayer, a reed serving for a pen, charcoal and gum-water for ink and a thin board for paper.  Allowed to proceed, as he and his guide were crossing an open plain with a few scattered bushes, the guide wheeled his horse round, called loudly to him and, warning him that a lion was at hand, made signs that he should ride away.  His horse was too much fatigued to do this, so they rode slowly past the bush, and he, not seeing anything himself, thought the guide had been mistaken.  Suddenly the Foulah put his hand to his mouth exclaiming, \"God preserve us!\"  To his great surprise he then perceived a large red lion a short distance from the bush, his head couched between his fore paws.  Park expected that the creature would instantly spring upon him, and instinctively pulled his foot from the stirrups to throw himself on the ground, that his horse might become the victim rather than himself; but probably the lion was not hungry, for he quietly allowed the traveller to pass though fairly within his reach.  The next day his horse completely broke down, and the united strength of himself and his guide could not place the animal again upon his legs. He sat down for some time beside the worn-out associate of his adventures; but, finding him still unable to rise, he took off the saddle and bridle and placed a quantity of grass before him.  While he surveyed his poor steed as he lay panting on the ground, he could not suppress the sad apprehension that he should himself in a short time lie down and perish in the same manner from fatigue and hunger.  With this foreboding he left his horse, and with great reluctance followed his guide on foot along the banks of the river until he reached the small village of Kea.  Here he parted from his Foulah guide, whom he requested to look after his horse on his return, which he promised to do.  From Kea he went down the river in a canoe, and thence to Moorzan, a fishing town on the northern bank, and was then conveyed across the stream to Silla, a large town.  Here, after much entreaty, the _dooty_ allowed him to enter his house to avoid the rain, but the place was damp and he had a smart attack of fever.  Worn down by sickness, exhausted with hunger, and fatigued, half-naked, without any article of value by which he could procure provisions, clothes, or lodgings, he began to reflect seriously on his situation, and was convinced by painful experience that the obstacles to his further progress were insurmountable.  The _dooty_ approved of the resolution he had arrived at of returning, and procured a fisherman to carry him across to Moorzan, whence he got back to Kea.  The brother of the _dooty_ was starting for Modiboo.  He took his saddle, which he had left at Kea, intending to present it to the king of Bambarra.  Travelling along the banks of the river, the footprints of a lion quite fresh in the mud were seen.  His companion, therefore, proceeded with great circumspection, insisting that Park should walk before him.  This he declined doing, when his guide threw down the saddle and left him alone.  He therefore continued his course along the bank, and believing that the lion was at no great distance, he became much alarmed, and took a long circuit through the bushes.  He at last arrived at Modiboo.  While conversing with the _dooty_ of the place he heard a horse neigh in one of the huts.  The _dooty_ inquired with a smile if he knew who was speaking to him.  He explained himself by telling Park that his horse was still alive and somewhat recovered from his fatigue, and that he must take the animal with him.  Though tolerably well treated at the villages where he stopped, he in vain endeavoured to obtain a guide.  The rains were now falling, and the country, it was supposed, would soon be completely flooded.  He heard that a report had been abroad that he had come to Bambarra as a spy and that, as Mansong had not admitted him into his presence, the _dooties_ of the different towns might treat him as they pleased.  A little before sunset of the 11th of August he reached Sansanding. Here even Mamadi, who had formerly been so kind to him, scarcely gave him a welcome, and everyone seemed to shun him.  Mamadi, however, came privately to him in the evening, and told him"]]]
