[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21241"],["title","The Rifle Rangers (#2)"],["body","tree-cactus \"Foconoztle\" (_Opuntia arborescens_), and the tall \"pitahaya\" (_Cereus giganteus_), with columnar shafts and straight upright arms, like the branches of gigantic candelabra; the echino-cacti, too--those huge mammals of the vegetable world, resting their globular or egg-shaped forms, without trunk or stalk, upon the surface of the earth.  There, too, I behold gigantic thistles (_cardonales_) and mimosas, both shrubby and arborescent--the tree-mimosa, and the sensitive-plant (_Mimosa frutescens_), that shrinks at my approach, and closes its delicate leaflets until I have passed out of sight.  This is the favourite land of the acacia; and immense tracts, covered with its various species, form impenetrable thickets (_chapparals_).  I distinguish in these thickets the honey-locust, with its long purple legumes, the \"algarobo\" (carob-tree), and the thorny \"mezquite\"; and, rising over all the rest, I descry the tall, slender stem of the _Fouquiera splendens_, with panicles of cube-shaped crimson flowers.  There is less of animal life here; but even these wild ridges have their denizens.  The cochineal insect crawls upon the cactus leaf, and huge winged ants build their clay nests upon the branches of the acacia-tree. The ant-bear squats upon the ground, and projects his glutinous tongue over the beaten highway, where the busy insects rob the mimosse of their aromatic leaves.  The armadillo, with his bands and rhomboidal scales, takes refuge in the dry recesses of the rocks, or, clewing himself up, rolls over the cliff to escape his pursuer.  Herds of cattle, half wild, roam through the glassy glades or over the tufted ridges, lowing for water; and black vultures (zopilotes) sail through the cloudless heavens, waiting for some scene of death to be enacted in the thickets below.  Here, too, I pass through scenes of cultivation.  Here is the hut of the peon and the rancho of the small proprietor; but they are structures of a more substantial kind than in the region of the palm.  They are of stone.  Here, too, is the hacienda, with its low white walls and prison-like windows; and the pueblita, with its church and cross and gaily-painted steeple.  Here the Indian corn takes the place of the sugarcane, and I ride through wide fields of the broad-leafed tobacco-plant.  Here grow the jalap and the guaiacum, the sweet-scented sassafras and the sanitary copaiba.  I ride onward, climbing steep ridges and descending into chasms (_barrancas_) that yawn deeply and gloomily.  Many of these are thousands of feet in depth; and the road that enables me to reach their bottoms is often no more than a narrow ledge of the impending cliff, running terrace-like over a foaming torrent.  Still onward and upward I go, until the \"foot-hills\" are passed, and I enter a defile of the mountains themselves--a pass of the Mexican Andes.  I ride through, under the shadow of dark forests and rocks of blue porphyry.  I emerge upon the other side of the sierra.  A new scene opens before my eyes--a scene of such soft loveliness that I suddenly rein up my horse, and gaze upon it with mingled feelings of admiration and astonishment.  I am looking upon one of the \"valles\" of Mexico, those great table-plains that lie within the Cordilleras of the Andes, thousands of feet above ocean-level, and, along with these mountains, stretching from the tropic almost to the shores of the Arctic Sea.  The plain before me is level, as though its surface were liquid.  I see mountains bounding it on all sides; but there are passes through them that lead into other plains (_valus_).  These mountains have no foot-hills.  They _stand up_ directly from the plain itself, sometimes with sloping conical sides--sometimes in precipitous cliffs.  I ride into the plain and survey its features.  There is no resemblance to the land I have left--the _tierra caliente_.  I am now in the _tierra templada_.  New objects present themselves--a new aspect is before, a new atmosphere around me.  The air is colder, but it is only the temperature of spring.  To me it feels chilly, coming so lately from the hot lands below; and I fold my cloak closely around me, and ride on.  The view is open, for the _valu_ is almost treeless.  The scene is no longer wild.  The earth has a cultivated aspect--an aspect of civilisation: for these high plateaux--the _tierras templadas_--are the seat of Mexican civilisation.  Here are the towns--the great cities, with their rich cathedrals and convents--here dwells the bulk of the population.  Here the rancho is built of unburnt bricks (_adobe's_)--a mud cabin, often inclosed by hedges of the columnar cactus.  Here are whole villages of such huts, inhabited by the dark-skinned descendants of the ancient Aztecs.  Fertile fields are around me.  I behold the maguey of culture (_Agave Americana_), in all its giant proportions.  The lance-like blades of the zea maize wave with a rich rustling in the breeze, for here that beautiful plant grows in its greatest luxuriance.  Immense plains are covered with wheat, with capsicum, and the Spanish bean (_frijoles_). My eyes are gladdened by the sight of roses climbing along the wall or twining the portal.  Here, too, the potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) flourishes in its native soil; the pear and the pomegranate, the quince and the apple, are seen in the orchard; and the cereals of the temperate zone grow side by side with the _Cucurbitacece_ of the tropics.  I pass from one _valu_ into another, by crossing a low ridge of the dividing mountains.  Mark the change!  A surface of green is before me, reaching on all sides to the mountain foot; and upon this roam countless herds, tended by mounted \"vaqueros\" (herdsmen).  I pass another ridge, and another _valid_ stretches before me.  Again a change!  A desert of sand, over the surface of which move tall dun columns of swirling dust, like the gigantic phantoms of some spirit-world.  I look into another _valle_, and behold shining waters-- lakes like inland seas--with sedgy shores and surrounded by green savannas, and vast swamps covered with reeds and \"tulares\" (bulrush).  Still another plain, black with lava and the scoriae of extinct volcanoes--black, treeless, and herbless--with not an atom of organic matter upon its desolate surface.  Such are the features of the plateau-land--varied, and vast, and full of wild interest.  I leave it and climb higher--nearer to the sky--up the steep sides of the Cordilleras--up to the _tierra fria_.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  I stand ten thousand feet above the level of the ocean.  I am under the deep shadows of a forest.  Huge trunks grow around me, hindering a distant view.  Where am I?  Not in the tropic, surely, for these trees are of a northern _sylva_.  I recognise the gnarled limbs and lobed leaves of the oak, the silvery branches of the mountain-ash, the cones and needles of the pine.  The wind, as it swirls among the dead leaves, causes me to shiver; and high up among the twigs there is the music of winter in its moaning.  Yet I am in the torrid zone; and the same sun that now glances coldly through the boughs of the oak, but a few hours before scorched me as it glistened from the fronds of the palm-tree.  The forest opens, and I behold hills under culture--fields of hemp and flax, and the hardy cereals of the frigid zone.  The rancho of the husbandman is a log cabin, with shingled roof and long projecting eaves, unlike the dwellings either of the great _valus_ or the _tierras calientes_.  I pass the smoking pits of the \"carbonero\", and I meet the \"arriero\" with his \"atajo\" of mules heavily laden with ice of the glaciers.  They are passing with their cargoes, to cool the wine-cups in the great cities of the plains.  Upward and upward!  The oak is left behind, and the pine grows stunted and dwarfish.  The wind blows colder and colder.  A wintry aspect is around me.  Upward still.  The pine disappears.  No vegetable form is seen save the mosses and lichens that cling to the rocks, as within the Arctic Circle. I am on the selvage of the snow--the eternal snow.  I walk upon glaciers, and through their translucent mass I behold the lichens growing beneath.  The scene is bleak and desolate, and I am chilled to the marrow of my bones.  _Excelsior! excelsior_!  The highest point is not yet reached.  Through drifts of snow and over fields of ice, up steep ledges, along the slippery escarpment that overhangs the giddy abysm, with wearied knees, and panting breath, and frozen fingers, onward and upward I go.  Ha!  I have won the goal.  I am on the summit!  I stand on the \"cumbre\" of Orizava--the mountain of the \"burning star\"-- more than three miles above the ocean level.  My face is turned to the east, and I look downward.  The snow, the cincture of lichens and naked rocks, the dark belt of pines, the lighter foliage of the oaks, the fields of barley, the waving maize, the thickets of yucca and acacia trees, the palm forest, the shore, the sea itself with its azure waves-- all these at a single vision!  From the summit of Orizava to the shores of the Mexican Sea, I glance through every gradation of the thermal line.  I am looking, as it were, from the pole to the equator!  I am alone.  My brain is giddy.  My pulse vibrates irregularly, and my heart beats with an audible distinctness.  I am oppressed with a sense of my own nothingness--an atom, almost invisible, upon the breast of the mighty earth.  I gaze and listen.  I see, but I hear not.  Here is sight, but no sound. Around me reigns an awful stillness--the sublime silence of the Omnipotent, who alone is here.  Hark! the silence is broken!  Was it the rumbling of thunder?  No.  It was the crash of the falling avalanche.  I tremble at its voice.  It is the voice of the Invisible--the whisper of a God!  I tremble and worship.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Reader, could you thus stand upon the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21241"],["title","The Rifle Rangers (#3)"],["body","of Orizava, and look down to the shores of the Mexican Gulf, you would have before you, as on a map, the scene of our \"adventures.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.

In the \"fall\" of 1846 I found myself in the city of New Orleans, filling up one of those pauses that occur between the chapters of an eventful life--doing nothing.  I have said an _eventful_ life.  In the retrospect of ten years, I could not remember as many weeks spent in one place.  I had traversed the continent from north to south, and crossed it from sea to sea.  My foot had pressed the summits of the Andes, and climbed the Cordilleras of the Sierra Madre.  I had steamed it down the Mississippi, and sculled it up the Orinoco.  I had hunted buffaloes with the Pawnees of the Platte, and ostriches upon the pampas of the Plata: to-day, shivering in the hut of an Esquimaux--a month after, taking my _siesta_ in an aery couch under the gossamer frondage of the corozo palm.  I had eaten raw meat with the trappers of the Rocky Mountains, and roast monkey among the Mosquito Indians; and much more, which might weary the reader, and ought to have made the writer a wiser man.  But, I fear, the spirit of adventure--its thirst--is within me slakeless.  I had just returned from a \"scurry\" among the Comanches of Western Texas, and the idea of \"settling down\" was as far from my mind as ever.  \"What next? what next?\" thought I.  \"Ha! the war with Mexico.\"  The war between the United States and that country had now fairly commenced.  My sword--a fine Toledo, taken from a Spanish officer at San Jacinto--hung over the mantel, rusting ingloriously.  Near it were my pistols--a pair of Colt's revolvers--pointing at each other in sullen muteness.  A warlike ardour seized upon me, and clutching, not the sword, but my pen, I wrote to the War Department for a commission; and, summoning all my patience, awaited the answer.  But I waited in vain.  Every bulletin from Washington exhibited its list of new-made officers, but my name appeared not among them.  In New Orleans--that most patriotic of republican cities--epaulettes gleamed upon every shoulder, whilst I, with the anguish of a Tantalus, was compelled to look idly and enviously on.  Despatches came in daily from the seat of war, filled with newly-glorious names; and steamers from the same quarter brought fresh batches of heroes--some legless, some armless, and others with a bullet-hole through the cheek, and perhaps the loss of a dozen teeth or so; but all thickly covered with laurels.  November came, but no commission.  Impatience and ennui had fairly mastered me.  The time hung heavily upon my hands.  \"How can I best pass the hour?  I shall go to the French opera, and hear Calve.\"  Such were my reflections as I sat one evening in my solitary chamber. In obedience to this impulse, I repaired to the theatre; but the bellicose strains of the opera, instead of soothing, only heightened my warlike enthusiasm, and I walked homeward, abusing, as I went, the president and the secretary-at-war, and the whole government-- legislative, judicial, and executive.  \"Republics _are_ ungrateful,\" soliloquised I, in a spiteful mood.  \"I have `surely put in strong enough' for it; my political connections--besides, the government owes me a favour--\"  \"Cl'ar out, ye niggers!  What de yer want?\"  This was a voice that reached me as I passed through the dark corner of the Faubourg Treme.  Then followed some exclamations in French; a scuffle ensued, a pistol went off, and I heard the same voice again calling out:  \"Four till one!  Injuns!  Murder!  Help, hyur!\"  I ran up.  It was very dark; but the glimmer of a distant lamp enabled me to perceive a man out in the middle of the street, defending himself against four others.  He was a man of giant size, and flourished a bright weapon, which I took to be a bowie-knife, while his assailants struck at him on all sides with sticks and stilettoes.  A small boy ran back and forth upon the banquette, calling for help.  Supposing it to be some street quarrel, I endeavoured to separate the parties by remonstrance.  I rushed between them, holding out my cane; but a sharp cut across the knuckles, which I had received from one of the small men, together with his evident intention to follow it up, robbed me of all zest for pacific meditation; and, keeping my eye upon the one who had cut me, I drew a pistol (I could not otherwise defend myself), and fired.  The man fell dead in his tracks, without a groan. His comrades, hearing me re-cock, took to their heels, and disappeared up a neighbouring alley.  The whole scene did not occupy the time you have spent in reading this relation of it.  One minute I was plodding quietly homeward; the next, I stood in the middle of the street; beside me a stranger of gigantic proportions; at my feet a black mass of dead humanity, half doubled up in the mud as it had fallen; on the banquette, the slight, shivering form of a boy; while above and around were silence and darkness.  I was beginning to fancy the whole thing a dream, when the voice of the man at my side dispelled this illusion.  \"Mister,\" said he, placing his arms akimbo, and facing me, \"if ye'll tell me yur name, I ain't a-gwine to forgit it.  No, Bob Linkin ain't that sorter.\"  \"What!  Bob Lincoln?  Bob Lincoln of the Peaks?\"  In the voice I had recognised a celebrated mountain trapper, and an old acquaintance, whom I had not met for several years.  \"Why, Lord save us from Injuns! it ain't you, Cap'n Haller?  May I be dog-goned if it ain't!  Whooray!--whoop!  I knowed it warn't no store-keeper fired that shot.  Haroo! whar are yur, Jack?\"  \"Here I am,\" answered the boy, from the pavement.  \"Kum hyur, then.  Ye ain't badly skeert, air yur?\"  \"No,\" firmly responded the boy, crossing over.  \"I tuk him from a scoundrelly Crow thet I overhauled on a fork of the Yellerstone.  He gin me a long pedigree, that is, afore I kilt the skunk.  He made out as how his people hed tuk the boy from the Kimanches, who hed brought him from somewhar down the Grande.  I know'd it wur all bamboozle.  The boy's white--American white.  Who ever seed a yeller-hided Mexikin with them eyes and ha'r?  Jack, this hyur's Cap'n Haller.  If yur kin iver save his life by givin' yur own, yur must do it, de ye hear?\"  \"I will,\" said the boy resolutely.  \"Come, Lincoln,\" I interposed, \"these conditions are not necessary.  You remember I was in your debt.\"  \"Ain't worth mentioning Cap; let bygones be bygones!\"  \"But what brought you to New Orleans? or, more particularly, how came you into this scrape?\"  \"Wal, Cap'n, bein' as the last question is the most partickler, I'll gin yur the answer to it fust.  I hed jest twelve dollars in my pouch, an' I tuk a idee inter my head thet I mout as well double it.  So I stepped into a shanty whar they wur a-playin' craps.  After bettin' a good spell, I won somewhar about a hundred dollars.  Not likin' the sign I seed about, I tuk Jack and put out.  Wal, jest as I was kummin' roun' this hyur corner, four fellers--them ye seed--run out and jumped me, like so many catamounts.  I tuk them for the same chaps I hed seed parley vooin' at the craps-table; an' tho't they wur only jokin', till one of them gin me a sockdolloger over the head, an' fired a pistol.  I then drewed my bowie, an' the skrimmage begun; an' thet's all I know about it, cap'n, more'n yurself.  \"Let's see if it's all up with this'n,\" continued the hunter, stooping. \"I'deed, yes,\" he drawled out; \"dead as a buck.  Thunder! ye've gin it him atween the eyes, plum.  He _is_ one of the fellers, es my name's Bob Linkin.  I kud sw'ar to them mowstaches among a million.\"  At this moment a patrol of night gendarmes came up; and Lincoln, and Jack, and myself were carried off to the calaboose, where we spent the remainder of the night.  In the morning we were brought before the recorder; but I had taken the precaution to send for some friends, who introduced me to his worship in a proper manner.  As my story corroborated Lincoln's, and his mine, and \"Jack's\" substantiated both; and as the comrades of the dead Creole did not appear, and he himself was identified by the police as a notorious robber, the recorder dismissed the case as one of \"justifiable homicide in self-defence\"; and the hunter and I were permitted to go our way without further interruption.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note.  Craps is a game of dice.    CHAPTER THREE.  A VOLUNTEER RENDEZVOUS.  \"Now, Cap,\" said Lincoln, as we seated ourselves at the table of a cafe, \"I'll answer t'other question yur put last night.  I wur up on the head of Arkansaw, an' hearin' they wur raisin' volunteers down hyur, I kim down ter jine.  It ain't often I trouble the settlements; but I've a mighty _puncheon_, as the Frenchmen says, to hev a crack at them yeller-bellies.  I hain't forgot a mean trick they sarved me two yeern ago, up thar by Santer Fe.\"  \"And so you have joined the volunteers?\"  \"That's sartin.  But why ain't you a-gwine to Mexico?  That 'ere's a wonder to me, cap, why you ain't.  Thur's a mighty grist o' venturin', I heern; beats Injun fightin' all holler, an' yur jest the beaver I'd 'spect to find in that 'ar dam.  Why don't you go?\"  \"So I purposed long since, and wrote on to Washington for a commission; but the government seems to have forgotten me.\"  \"Dod rot the government! git a commission for yourself.\"  \"How?\"  I asked.  \"Jine us, an' be illected--thet's how.\"  This had crossed my mind before; but,"]]]
