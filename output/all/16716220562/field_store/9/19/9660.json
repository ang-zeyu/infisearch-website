Seaton swung number six visiplate around, looked once, and switched on the radio.  \"Well, Dunark,\" he said grimly. \"You get your wish. That bird is coming out, with at least twice the acceleration we could get with both motors full on. He saw us all the time, and was waiting for us.\"  \"Go on--get away if you can. You can stand a higher acceleration than we can. We'll hold him as long as possible.\"  \"I would, if it would do any good, but it won't. He's so much faster than we are that he could catch us anyway, if he wanted to, no matter how much of a start we had--and it looks now as though he wanted us. Two of us stand a lot better chance than one of licking him if he's looking for trouble. Spread out a mile or two, and pretend this is all the speed we've got. What'll we give him first?\"  \"Give him everything at once. Rays six, seven, eight, nine, and ten....\" Crane, with Seaton, began making contacts, rapidly but with precision. \"Heat wave two-seven. Induction, five-eight. Oscillation, everything under point oh six three. All the explosive copper we can get in. Right?\"  \"Right--and if worse comes to worst, remember the zone of force. Let him shoot first, because he may be peaceable--but it doesn't look like olive branches to me.\"  \"Got both your screens out?\"  \"Yes. Mart, you might take number two visiplate and work the guns--I'll handle the rest of this stuff. Better strap yourselves in solid, folks--this may develop into a kind of rough party, by the looks of things right now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As he spoke, a pyrotechnic display enveloped the entire ship as a radiation from the foreign vessel struck the other neutralizing screen and dissipated its force harmlessly in the ether. Instantly Seaton threw on the full power of his refrigerating system and shot in the master switch that actuated the complex offensive armament of his dreadnought of the skies. An intense, livid violet glow hid completely main and auxiliary power bars, and long flashes leaped between metallic objects in all parts of the vessel. The passengers felt each hair striving to stand on end as the very air became more and more highly charged--and this was but the slight corona-loss of the frightful stream of destruction being hurled at the other space-cruiser, now scarcely a mile away!  Seaton stared into number one visiplate, manipulating levers and dials as he drove the _Skylark_ hither and yon, dodging frantically, the while the automatic focusing devices remained centered upon the enemy and the enormous generators continued to pour forth their deadly frequencies. The bars glowed more fiercely as they were advanced to full working load--the stranger was one blaze of incandescent ionization, but she still fought on; and Seaton noticed that the pyrometers recording the temperature of the shell were mounting rapidly, in spite of the refrigerators.  \"Dunark, put everything you've got upon one spot--right on the end of his nose!\"  As the first shell struck the mark, Seaton concentrated every force at his command upon the designated point. The air in the _Skylark_ crackled and hissed and intense violet flames leaped from the bars as they were driven almost to the point of disruption. From the forward end of the strange craft there erupted prominence after prominence of searing, unbearable flame as the terrific charges of explosive copper struck the mark and exploded, liberating instantaneously their millions upon millions of kilowatt-hours of intra-atomic energy. Each prominence enveloped all three of the fighting vessels and extended for hundreds of miles out into space--but still the enemy warship continued to hurl forth solid and vibratory destruction.  A brilliant orange light flared upon the panel, and Seaton gasped as he swung his visiplate upon his defenses, which he had supposed impregnable. His outer screen was already down, although its mighty copper generator was exerting its utmost power. Black areas had already appeared and were spreading rapidly, where there should have been only incandescent radiance; and the inner screen was even now radiating far into the ultra-violet and was certainly doomed. Knowing as he did the stupendous power driving those screens, he knew that there were superhuman and inconceivable forces being directed against them, and his right hand flashed to the switch controlling the zone of force. Fast as he was, much happened in the mere moment that passed before his flying hand could close the switch. In the last infinitesimal instant of time before the zone closed in, a gaping black hole appeared in the incandescence of the inner screen, and a small portion of a ray of energy so stupendous as to be palpable, struck, like a tangible projectile, the exposed flank of the _Skylark_. Instantly the refractory arenak turned an intense, dazzling white and more than a foot of the forty-eight-inch skin of the vessel melted away, like snow before an oxy-acetylene flame: melting and flying away in molten globes and sparkling gases--the refrigerating coils lining the hull were of no avail against the concentrated energy of that titanic thrust. As Seaton shut off his power, intense darkness and utter silence closed in, and he snapped on the lights.  \"They take one trick!\" he blazed, his eyes almost emitting sparks, and leaped for the generators. He had forgotten the efforts of the zone of force, however, and only sprawled grotesquely in the air until he floated within reach of a line.  \"Hold everything, Dick!\" Crane snapped, as Seaton bent over one of the bars. \"What are you going to do?\"  \"I'm going to put as heavy bars in these ray-generators as they'll stand and go out and get that bird. We can't lick him with Osnomian rays or with our explosive copper, but I can carve that sausage into slices with a zone of force, and I'm going to do it.\"  \"Steady, old man--take it easy. I see your point, but remember that you must release the zone of force before you can use it as a weapon. Furthermore, you must discover his exact location, and must get close enough to him to use the zone as a weapon, all without its protection. Can those ray-screens be made sufficiently powerful to withstand the beam they employed last, even for a second?\"  \"Hm ... m ... m. Never thought of that, Mart,\" Seaton replied, the fire dying out of his eyes. \"Wonder how long the battle lasted?\"  \"Eight and two-tenths seconds, from first to last, but they had had that heavy ray in action only a fraction of one second when you cut in the zone of force. Either they underestimated our strength at first, or else it required about eight seconds to tune in their heavy generators--probably the former.\"  \"But we've _got_ to do something, man! We can't just sit here and twiddle our thumbs!\"  \"Why, and why not? That course seems eminently wise and proper. In fact, at the present time, thumb-twiddling is distinctly indicated.\"  \"Oh, you're full of little red ants! We can't do a thing with that zone on--and you say just sit here. Suppose they know all about that zone of force? Suppose they can crack it? Suppose they ram us?\"  \"I shall take up your objections in order,\" Crane had lighted a cigarette and was smoking meditatively. \"First, they may or may not know about it. At present, that point is immaterial. Second, whether or not they know about it, it is almost a certainty that they cannot crack it. It had been up for more than three minutes, and they have undoubtedly concentrated everything possible upon us during that time. It is still standing. I really expected it to go down in the first few seconds, but now that it has held this long it will, in all probability, continue to hold indefinitely. Third, they most certainly will not ram us, for several reasons. They probably have encountered few, if any, foreign vessels able to stand against them for a minute, and will act accordingly. Then, too, it is probably safe to assume that their vessel is damaged, to some slight extent at least; for I do not believe that any possible armament could withstand the forces you directed against them and escape entirely unscathed. Finally, if they did ram us, what would happen? Would we feel the shock? That barrier in the ether seems impervious, and if so, it could not transmit a blow. I do not see exactly how it would affect the ship dealing the blow. You are the one who works out the new problems in unexplored mathematics--some time you must take a few months off and work it out.\"  \"Yes, it would take that long, too, I guess--but you're right, he can't hurt us. That's using the old bean, Mart! I was going off half-cocked again, darn it! I'll pipe down, and we'll go into a huddle.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Seaton noticed that Dorothy's face was white and that she was fighting for self-control. Drawing himself over to her, he picked her up in a tight embrace.  \"Cheer up, Red-Top! This man's war ain't started yet!\"  \"Not started? What do you mean? Haven't you and Martin just been admitting to each other that you can't do anything? Doesn't that mean that we are beaten?\"  \"Beaten! Us? How do you get that way? Not on your sweet young life!\" he ejaculated, and the surprise on his face was so manifest that she recovered instantly. \"We've just dug a hole and pulled the hole in after us, that's all! When we get everything doped out to suit us, we'll snap out of it and that bird'll think he's been petting a wildcat!\"  \"Mart, you're the thinking end of this partnership,\" he continued, thoughtfully. \"You've got the analytical mind and the judicial disposition, and can think circles around me. From what little you've seen of those folks, tell me who, what, and where they are. I'm getting the germ of an idea, and maybe we can make it work.\"  \"I will try it.\" Crane paused. \"They are, of course, neither from the Earth nor from Osnome.

D.   Late Professor in Columbia University     D. C. Heath & Co., Publishers   Boston   New York   Chicago       Copyright, 1906 and 1909,   By D. C. Heath & Co   419     Printed in U.S.A.     PREFACE   This book is designed to accompany an introductory study of the history of German literature. It is assumed that the history itself will be learned, so far as necessary, either from lectures or from some other book devoted to the subject. As the selections were made, for the most part, while I was writing my own short history of German literature for the series published under the general editorship of Mr. Edmund Gosse and known as “Literatures of the World,” it was natural that the Anthology should take on, to some extent, the character of a companion book to the History. At the same time I did not desire that either book should necessarily involve the use of the other. Hence the absence of cross references; and hence also, in the Anthology, the brief introductory notes, giving important dates and summary characterizations. These are meant to enable the student to read the selections intelligently without constant recourse to some other book.  In preparing Part First, I have had in mind the student who has learned to read the language of Goethe and Schiller with some facility, and would like to know something of the earlier periods, but has not studied, and may not care to study, Old and Middle German. On this account the selections are given in modern German translations. The original texts are omitted because space was very precious, and because the book was intended as an aid to literary rather than linguistic study. In making the selections, my first principle was to give a good deal of the best rather than a little of everything. I wished to make friends for medieval German poetry, and it seemed to me that this could best be done by showing it in its strength and its beauty. So I have ignored much that might have had a historical or linguistic interest for the scholar, and have steadily applied the criterion of literary worth.  My second principle was to give preference to that which is truly German, in contradistinction from that which is Latin, or European, or merely Christian. The Latinists of every epoch are in general disregarded, as not being of German literature in the strict sense; yet I have devoted eight pages to _Waltharius_ and three to _Rudlieb_, on the ground that the matter of these poems is essentially German, albeit their form is Latin. On the other hand, Hrotswith is not represented at all, because, while an interesting personage in her way, she belongs to German literature neither by her form nor by her matter. The religious poetry of the twelfth century receives rather scant attention, partly because it is mostly pretty poor stuff--there is not much else like the beautiful Arnstein hymn to the Virgin, No. XIII--and partly because it embodies ideas and feelings that belonged to medieval Christianity everywhere.  For each selection I have given the best translation that I could find, and where nothing satisfactory could be found in print I have made a translation myself. Where nothing is said as to the authorship of a translation, it is to be understood as my own. In this part of my work I have tried to preserve the form and savor of the originals, and at the same time to keep as close to the exact sense as the constraints of rime and meter would allow. In Nos. XI to XVII a somewhat perplexing problem was presented. The originals frequently have assonance instead of rime and the verse is sometimes crude in other ways. An attempt to imitate the assonances and crudities in modern German would simply have given the effect of bad verse-making. On the other hand, to translate into smooth tetrameters, with perfect rime everywhere, would have given an illusory appearance of regularity and have made the translation _zu schön_. (I fear that No. VII, the selections from Otfried, for the translation of which I am not responsible, is open to this charge.) So I adopted the expedient of a line-for-line prose version, dropping into rime only where the modern equivalent of the Middle German took the form of rime naturally. After regular rime becomes established--with Heinrich von Veldeke--I have employed it in all my translations. For my shortcomings as a German versifier I hope to be regarded with a measure of indulgence. The question of inclusion or exclusion could not be made to turn on the preëxistence of a good translation, because too much that is important and interesting would have had to be omitted. I should have been glad to take the advice of Mephisto,    Associiert euch mit einem Poeten,  but I was unable to effect a partnership of that kind.  Beginning with No. XL, the selections are given in their original form without modernization. While Part Second, no less than Part First, looks to literary rather than linguistic study, it seemed to me very desirable that the selections from writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries should represent the literary language of that time. By modernizing I could have dispensed with many a footnote and have made the texts somewhat easier to read; but that gain would have entailed a very unfortunate loss of savor, and have deprived the selections of all incidental value as _Sprachproben_. On the other hand, I could see no advantage in a scrupulous reproduction of careless punctuation, mere mistakes, or meaningless peculiarities of spelling. As there is no logical stopping-place when an editor once begins to retouch a text, I finally decided to follow, in each selection, either a trustworthy reprint or else a good critical edition, without attempting to harmonize the different editors or to apply any general rules of my own. The reader is thus assured of a fairly authentic text, though he will find inconsistencies of spelling due to the idiosyncrasy of editors. Thus one editor may preserve _vnd_ or _vnnd_, while another prints _und_; one may have _itzt_, another _jtzt_, and so on.  Finally, I desire to call attention here to the fact that, while a few selections from Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller are given, by way of illustrating their early work in its relation to the literary renascence, no attempt is made to deal adequately with the classical literature of the eighteenth century. The book extends _to_ the classics. I must admit that the limit thus set is a little vague, and from a theoretical point of view not quite satisfactory; but practical considerations decided in favor of it. To have done justice to the classics, on the scale adopted for the rest of the book, would have required an additional hundred pages, devoted to long extracts from works which, for the most part, have been carefully edited for American students, are commonly read in schools and colleges, and could be presumed to be familiar to most users of the Anthology. As the additional matter would thus have been largely useless, it seemed to me that the ideal gain in symmetry would be more than offset by the increased bulk and cost of the book, which was already large enough. I hold of course that anthologies have their use in the study of literary history; but it would be a mistake, in my judgment, for any student to take up a volume of selections without having first read the more important works of Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller.
