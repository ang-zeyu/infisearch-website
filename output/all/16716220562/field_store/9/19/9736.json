Now, how long d'ye think it would take them?--guess.\"  Fred Borders smiled as he said this, and looked round the circle of men.  \"I know,\" cried one; \"it would take the whole forty thousand _a week_ to do it.\"  \"Oh! nonsense, they could do it easy in two days,\" said another.  \"That shows how little you know about big numbers,\" observed Tom Lokins, knocking the ashes out of his pipe.  \"I'm pretty sure it couldn't be done in much less than six months; workin' hard all day, and makin' allowance for only one hour off for dinner.\"  \"You're all wrong, shipmates,\" said Fred Borders.  \"That young doctor told me that if they'd begun work at the day of creation they would only have just finished the job last year!\"  \"Oh! gammon, you're jokin',\" cried Bill Blunt.  \"No, I'm not,\" said Fred, \"for I was told afterwards by an old clergyman that the young doctor was quite right, and that anyone who was good at 'rithmetic could work the thing out for himself in less than half an hour.\"  Just as Fred said this there came a loud cry from the mast-head that made us all spring to our feet like lightning.  \"There she blows!  There she breaches!\"  The captain was on deck in a moment.  \"Where away?\" he cried.  \"On the lee beam, sir.  Sperm whale, about two miles off.  There she blows!\"  Every man was at his station in a moment; for, after being some months out, we became so used to the work, that we acted together like a piece of machinery.  But our excitement never abated in the least.  \"Sing out when the ship heads for her.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  \"Keep her away!\" said the captain to the man at the helm.  \"Bob Ledbury, hand me the spy-glass.\"  \"Steady,\" from the mast-head.  \"Steady it is,\" answered the man at the helm.  While we were all looking eagerly out ahead we heard a thundering snore behind us, followed by a heavy splash.  Turning quickly round, we saw the flukes of an enormous whale sweeping through the air not more than six hundred yards astern of us.  \"Down your helm,\" roared the captain; \"haul up the mainsail, and square the yards.  Call all hands.\"  \"All hands, ahoy!\" roared Bill Blunt, in a voice of thunder, and in another moment every man in the ship was on deck.  \"Hoist and swing the boats,\" cried the captain.  \"Lower away.\"  Down went the boats into the water; the men were into their places almost before you could wink, and we pulled away from the ship just as the whale rose the second time, about half a mile away to leeward.  From the appearance of this whale we felt certain that it was one of the largest we had yet seen, so we pulled after it with right good will.  I occupied my usual place in the captain's boat, next the bow oar, just beside Tom Lokins, who was ready with his harpoons in the bow.  Young Borders pulled the oar directly in front of me.  The captain himself steered, and, as our crew was a picked one, we soon left the other two boats behind us.  Presently a small whale rose close beside us, and, sending a shower of spray over the boat, went down in a pool of foam.  Before we had time to speak, another whale rose on the opposite side of the boat, and then another on our starboard bow.  We had got into the middle of a shoal of whales, which commenced leaping and spouting all round us, little aware of the dangerous enemy that was so near.  In a few minutes more up comes the big one again that we had first seen.  He seemed very active and wild.  After blowing on the surface once or twice, about a quarter of a mile off, he peaked his flukes, and pitched down head foremost.  \"Now then, lads, he's down for a long dive,\" said the captain; \"spring your oars like men, we'll get that fish for certain, if you'll only pull.\"  The captain was mistaken; the whale had only gone down deep in order to come up and breach, or spring out of the water, for the next minute he came up not a hundred yards from us, and leaped his whole length into the air.  A shout of surprise broke from the men, and no wonder, for this was the largest fish I ever saw or heard of, and he came up so clear of the water that we could see him from head to tail as he turned over in the air, exposing his white belly to view, and came down on his great side with a crash like thunder, that might have been heard six miles off.  A splendid mass of pure white spray burst from the spot where he fell, and in another moment he was gone.  \"I do believe it's _New Zealand Tom_,\" cried Bill Blunt, referring to an old bull whale that had become famous among the men who frequented these seas for its immense size and fierceness, and for the great trouble it had given them, smashing some of their boats, and carrying away many of their harpoons.  \"I don't know whether it's New Zealand Tom or not,\" said the captain, \"but it's pretty clear that he's an old sperm bull.  Give way, lads, we must get that whale whatever it should cost us.\"  We did not need a second bidding; the size of the fish was so great that we felt more excited than we had yet been during the voyage, so we bent our oars till we almost pulled the boat out of the water.  The other boats had got separated, chasing the little whales, so we had this one all to ourselves.  \"There she blows!\" said Tom Lokins, in a low voice, as the fish came up a short distance astern of us.  We had overshot our mark, so, turning about, we made for the whale, which kept for a considerable time near the top of the water, spouting now and then, and going slowly to windward.  We at last got within a few feet of the monster, and the captain suddenly gave the word, \"Stand up.\"  This was to our harpooner, Tom Lokins, who jumped up on the instant, and buried two harpoons deep in the blubber.  \"Stern all!\" was the next word, and we backed off with all our might. It was just in time, for, in his agony, the whale tossed his tail right over our heads, the flukes were so big that they could have completely covered the boat, and he brought them down flat on the sea with a clap that made our ears tingle, while a shower of spray drenched us to the skin.  For one moment I thought it was all over with us, but we were soon out of immediate danger, and lay on our oars watching the writhings of the wounded monster as he lashed the ocean into foam.  The water all round us soon became white like milk, and the foam near the whale was red with blood.  Suddenly this ceased, and, before we could pull up to lance him, he went down, taking the line out at such a rate that the boat spun round, and sparks of fire flew from the loggerhead from the chafing of the rope.  \"Hold on!\" cried the captain, and next moment we were tearing over the sea at a fearful rate, with a bank of white foam rolling before us, high above our bows, and away on each side of us like the track of a steamer, so that we expected it every moment to rush inboard and swamp us.  I had never seen anything like this before.  From the first I had a kind of feeling that some evil would befall us.  While we were tearing over the water in this way, we saw the other whales coming up every now and then and blowing quite near to us, and presently we passed close enough to the first mate's boat to see that he was fast to a fish, and unable, therefore, to render us help if we should need it.  In a short time the line began to slack, so we hauled it in hand over hand, and Tom Lokins coiled it away in the tub in the stern of the boat, while the captain took his place in the bow to be ready with the lance.  The whale soon came up, and we pulled with all our might towards him.  Instead of making off again, however, he turned round and made straight at the boat.  I now thought that destruction was certain, for, when I saw his great blunt forehead coming down on us like a steamboat, I felt that we could not escape.  I was mistaken.  The captain received him on the point of his lance, and the whale has such a dislike to pain, that even a small prick will sometimes turn him.  For some time we kept dodging round this fellow; but he was so old and wise, that he always turned his head to us, and prevented us from getting a chance to lance him.  At last he turned a little to one side, and the captain plunged the lance deep into his vitals.  \"Ha! that's touched his life,\" cried Tom, as a stream of blood flew up from his blowholes, a sure sign that he was mortally wounded.  But he was not yet conquered.  After receiving the cruel stab with the lance, he pitched right down, head foremost, and once more the line began to fly out over the bow.  We tried to hold on, but he was going so straight down that the boat was almost swamped, and we had to slack off to prevent our being pulled under water.  Before many yards of the line had run out, one of the coils in the tub became entangled.  \"Look out, lads!\" cried Tom, and at once throwing the turn off the logger-head, he made an attempt to clear it.  The captain, in trying to do the same thing, slipped and fell.  Seeing this, I sprang up, and, grasping the coil as it flew past, tried to clear it.  Before I could think, a turn whipped round my left wrist.  I felt a wrench as if my arm had been torn out of the socket, and in a moment I was overboard, going down with almost lightning speed into the depths of the sea. Strange to say, I did not lose my presence of mind.  I knew exactly what had happened.  I felt myself rushing down, down, down with terrific speed; a stream of fire seemed to be whizzing past my eyes; there was a dreadful pressure on my brain, and a roaring as if of thunder in my ears.  Yet, even in that dread moment, thoughts of eternity, of my sins, and of meeting with my God, flashed into my mind, for thought is quicker than the lightning flash.

Nobody knew exactly how long he had made his home there because his neighbors seldom saw him. He might have been in the garden a whole summer before anybody set eyes on him.  Those that were acquainted with him called him Grandfather Mole. And the reason why his friends didn't meet him oftener was because he spent most of his time underground. Grandfather Mole's house was in a mound at one end of the garden. He had made the house himself, for he was a great digger. And Mr. Meadow Mouse often remarked that it had more halls than any other dwelling he had ever seen. He had visited it when Grandfather Mole was away from home, so he knew what it was like.  Some of those halls that Mr. Meadow Mouse mentioned ran right out beneath the surface of the garden. Grandfather Mole had dug them for a certain purpose. Through them he made his way in the darkness, whenever he was hungry (which was most of the time, for he had a huge appetite!). And when he took an underground stroll he was almost sure to find a few angleworms, which furnished most of his meals.  To be sure, he did not despise a grub--if he happened to meet one--nor a cutworm nor a wire-worm.  The wonder of it was that Grandfather Mole ever found anything to eat, for the old gentleman was all but blind. The only good Grandfather Mole's eyes did him was to let him tell darkness from light. They were so small that his neighbors claimed he hadn't any at all.  Another odd thing about this odd person was his ears. The neighbors said they couldn't see them, either. But they were in his head, even if they didn't show. And Grandfather Mole himself sometimes remarked that he didn't know how he could have burrowed as he did if he had been forever getting dirt in his eyes and ears. He seemed quite satisfied to be just as he was.  And he used to say that he didn't know what good eyes were to anyone whether he was under the ground or on top of it!  Liking to dig as he did, he certainly had nothing to complain about. His long nose was as good as a drill. And his front legs were just long enough so that he could reach his large, spade-like feet beyond his nose and throw the dirt back. His fur lay in one direction as easily as in another, never troubling him in the least when he was boring his way through the dry, loose soil of Farmer Green's garden.  So in spite of what might seem great drawbacks to others, Grandfather Mole was contented with his lot. The only thing he was ever known to grumble about was the scarcity of angleworms.     II  WHAT THE CAT CAUGHT   EVERYBODY knew the cat at Farmer Green's to be a great hunter. She had long since disposed of the last mouse that was so foolish as to venture inside her home. And being very big, and not at all timid, she had made such a name for herself in the neighborhood that even the rats looked on her as a monster to be avoided.  Now it often happened that this capable cat turned up her nose at the saucer of milk that Farmer Green's wife set before her with great regularity. And off she would go--sometimes to the barn, sometimes to the fields--to see what she could find that would furnish her both food and a frolic. For she thought it great sport to capture some small creature.  She was crossing the garden early one morning, on her way to the meadow, when she came upon Grandfather Mole. And having no pity for him--in spite of his blindness--she thought there was no sense in going any further for her breakfast. She would enjoy it right there in the garden. But first she would play with Grandfather Mole, before eating. For she was a pleasure-loving dame. She must have her sport, no matter if her breakfast waited.  Grandfather Mole had blundered that morning. Burrowing his way just under the surface of the ground, he had broken through the sun-baked crust of the garden before he knew it. And as he groped about, surprised to find himself in the open, Miss Kitty had pounced upon him.  Grandfather Mole struggled to escape. And his captor let him go, to give herself the pleasure of pouncing upon him again. She knew well enough that he couldn't get away from her. He could run quite spryly for an old gentleman--it is true. But when he couldn't see where he was going, of what use was running?  Farmer Green's cat didn't know the answer to that question herself. She captured and freed Grandfather Mole several times. And to tell the truth, she couldn't help wishing he could see, so he could make the game livelier. But she was the sort of cat that believes in making the best of things. And she kept pretending that Grandfather Mole almost got away from her. She would let him run about for a few moments and then she would leap upon him as if she had nearly lost him.  It was great fun for the cat. But Grandfather Mole did not enjoy it in the least. He thought such treatment far from neighborly. And he quite agreed with old Mr. Crow, who had come hurrying up to see what was going on.  \"Give him a chance! Give him a chance!\" Mr. Crow called to the cat, as he glared down at her from a tree close by.  The cat had been about to spring at Grandfather Mole again when Mr. Crow spoke to her. It was only natural that she should pause and turn her head. And she looked at Mr. Crow none too pleasantly.  \"I'll thank you to mind your own affairs,\" she said, and her voice was not nearly so polite as her words. \"No gentleman would interrupt a lady at her breakfast,\" she added.  Something seemed to amuse Mr. Crow, for he laughed loudly. The cat didn't know what he was laughing at. And after staring at him a few moments longer she turned her head to look at Grandfather Mole.  It wasn't more than ten seconds since she had taken her eyes off him. But Grandfather Mole had vanished.     III  A BREAKFAST LOST   WHEN Farmer Green's cat looked around and discovered that Grandfather Mole had disappeared from the garden a puzzled look came over her face. She couldn't think where he had gone in just a few seconds.  But she knew then why Mr. Crow had laughed. And she was not pleased.  \"Where is he?\" she asked Mr. Crow. \"You interrupted me at my breakfast and now I've lost it.\"  Mr. Crow was rocking back and forth on his perch, for a joke--on anybody except himself--always delighted him.  [Illustration: Grandfather Mole Escapes From Miss Kitty. (_Page 8_)]  \"Grandfather Mole is right here in the garden,\" he declared.  \"Then he must have hidden beneath a vegetable,\" the cat observed.  \"I shouldn't say that, exactly,\" Mr. Crow replied.  \"How far away is he?\" the cat demanded.  \"That would be hard to tell,\" Mr. Crow answered.  Farmer Green's cat had never liked Mr. Crow, for no particular reason. And now she certainly had a very special reason for being angry with him.  \"It's all your fault,\" she scolded. \"If you hadn't spoken to me I'd never have taken my eyes off Grandfather Mole.... The least you can do,\" she added, \"is to tell me this instant where Grandfather Mole is.\"  \"I've already told you,\" Mr. Crow reminded her. \"He's here in the garden. Find him if you can!\"  At that Farmer Green's cat began to run up and down between the rows of vegetables. But she had no luck at all. So after a while she came back and told Mr. Crow that she didn't believe him.  \"Tut, tut!\" said Mr. Crow. \"You haven't looked in the right place.\"  \"I've searched the whole garden!\""]]]
