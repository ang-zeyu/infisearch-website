The episcopal dwelling steadily rose in magnificence and size. It boasted noble residents besides the Bishops, for John of Gaunt died here in 1399, having probably been hospitably taken in after the burning of his own palace at the Savoy. The strawberries of Ely Garden were famous, and Shakespeare makes reference to them, thus following closely Holinshed. But in the reign of Queen Elizabeth a blight fell on the Bishops. It began with the envious desires of Sir Christopher Hatton, who, by reason of his dancing and courtly tricks, had won the susceptible Queen's fancy and been made Lord Chancellor. He settled down on Ely Place, taking the gate-house as his residence, excepting the two rooms reserved as cells and the lodge. He held also part of the garden on a lease of twenty-one years, and the nominal rent he had to pay was a red rose, ten loads of hay, and £10 per annum. The Bishop had the right of passing through the gate-house, of walking in his own garden, and of gathering twenty bushels of roses yearly. Hatton spent much money (borrowed from the Queen) in improving and beautifying the estate, which pleased him so well that he farther petitioned the Queen to grant him the whole property. The poor, ill-used Bishop protested, but was sternly repressed, and the only concession he could obtain was the right to buy back the estate if he could at any time repay Hatton the sums which had been spent on it. But Hatton did not remain unpunished. The Queen, a hard creditor, demanded the immense sums which she had lent to him, and it is said he died of a broken heart, crushed at being unable to repay them. His nephew Newport, who took the name of Hatton, was, however, allowed to succeed him. The widow of this second Hatton married Sir Edward Coke, the ceremony being performed in St. Andrew's Church. The Bishops' and the Hattons' rights of property seem to have been somewhat involved, for after the death of this widow the Bishops returned, and in the beginning of the eighteenth century the Hatton property was saddled with an annual rent-charge of £100 payable to the See; and, in 1772, when, on the death of the last Hatton heir, the property fell to the Crown, the See was paid £200 per annum, and given a house in Dover Street, Piccadilly, in lieu of Ely Place. Malcolm says: \"When a more convenient Excise Office was lately wanted, the ground on which Ely House stood was thought of for it, but its situation was objected to. When an intention was formed of removing the Fleet Prison, Ely House was judged proper on account of the quantity of ground about it, but the neighbouring inhabitants in Hatton Garden petitioned against the prison being built there. A scheme is now (1773) said to be in agitation for converting it into a Stamp Office, that business being at present carried on in chambers in Lincoln's Inn.\" So much for the history and ownership of a place which played a considerable part in London history. The fabric itself must have been very magnificent. There was a venerable hall 74 feet long, with six Gothic windows. At Ely House were held magnificent feasts by the Serjeants-at-Law, one of which continued for five days, and was honoured on the first day by the presence of Henry VIII. and Katherine of Aragon. Stow's account of this festival is perhaps worth quoting:      \"It were tedious to set down the preparation of fish, flesh, and     other victuals spent in this feast, and would seem almost     incredible, and, as to me it seemeth, wanted little of a feast at a     coronation; nevertheless, a little I will touch, for declaration of     the charge of prices. There were brought to the slaughter-house     twenty-four great beefs at twenty-six shillings and eightpence the     piece from the shambles, one carcass of an ox at twenty-four     shillings, one hundred fat muttons two shillings and tenpence the     piece, fifty-two great veals at four shillings and eightpence the     piece, thirty-four porks three shillings and eightpence the piece,     ninety-one pigs sixpence the piece, capons of geese, of one     poulterer (for they had three), ten dozens at twenty-pence the     piece, capons of Kent nine dozens and six at twelvepence the piece,     capons coarse nineteen dozen at sixpence the piece, cocks of grose     seven dozen and nine at eightpence the piece, cocks coarse fourteen     dozen and eight at threepence the piece, pullets, the best,     twopence halfpenny, other pullets twopence, pigeons thirty-seven     dozen at tenpence the dozen, swans fourteen dozen, larks three     hundred and forty dozen at fivepence the dozen, &c. Edward Nevill     was seneschal or steward, Thomas Ratcliffe, comptroller, Thomas     Wildon, clerk of the Kitchen\" (Thomas's edit. Stow, pp. 144, 145).  During the Civil War the house was used both as a hospital and a prison. Great part of it was demolished during the imprisonment of Bishop Wren by the Commonwealth, and some of the surrounding streets were built on the site of the garden. Vine Street, Hatton Garden, Saffron Hill, of which the lower end was once Field Lane, carry their origin in their names. Evelyn, writing June 7, 1659, says that he came to see the \"foundations now laying for a long streete and buildings on Hatton Garden, designed for a little towne, lately an ample garden.\" The chapel, dedicated to St. Ethelreda, now alone remains. It was for a time held by a Welsh Episcopalian congregation, but in 1874 was obtained by Roman Catholics, the Welsh congregation passing on to St. Benet's, on St. Benet's Hill in Thames Street. The chapel stands back from the street, and is faced by a stone wall and arched porch surmounted by a cross. This stonework is all modern. An entrance immediately facing the porch leads into the crypt, which is picturesque with old stone walls and heavily-timbered roof. This is by far the older part of the building, the chapel above being a rebuilding on the same foundation. The crypt probably dates back from the first foundation of De Luda, and the chapel from the restoration of Arundel. When the Roman Catholics came into possession, the late Sir Gilbert Scott was employed in a thorough restoration, during which a heavy stone bowl, about the size of a small font, was dug up. It is of granite, and is supposed to be of considerably more ancient date than the fabric itself, being pre-Saxon. From the size, it is improbable it was used as a font, being more likely a holy-water stoup, for which purpose it is now employed. Having been placed on a fitting shaft, it stands outside the entrance to the church, on the south side, in the cloister, which is probably on the site of the ancient cloister. There is a simple Early English porch, beautifully proportioned with mouldings of the period. Within the church corresponds in shape with the crypt; two magnificent windows east and west are worthy of a much larger building. Those on each side are of recent date, having been reconstructed from a filled-in window on the south side of the chancel. The reliquary contains a great treasure--a portion of the hand of St. Ethelreda, which member, having been taken from the chapel, after many wanderings, fell into the possession of a convent of nuns, who refused to give it up. Finally judgment was given to the effect that the nuns should retain a portion, while the part of a finger was granted to the church, which was accordingly done. It was this saint who gave rise to our word \"tawdry.\" She was popularly known as St. Awdrey, and strings of beads sold in her name at fairs, etc., came to be made of any worthless glass or rubbish, and were called tawdry. The crypt is used as a regular church, and is filled with seats; service is held here as well as above.  The timber beams in the roof are now (1903) undergoing thorough restoration, and the outer walls of the chapel are being repointed.  From this quaint relic of past times, rich with the indefinable attraction which nothing but a history of centuries can give, we pass out into Ely Place. This is a quiet cul-de-sac composed almost wholly of the offices of business men, solicitors, etc. At the north end, beyond the chapel, the old houses are down, and new ones will be erected in their place. At the end a small watchman's lodge stands on the spot where stood the Bishops' Gateway, in which the parasite, Sir Christopher Hatton, first fastened on his host.  Hatton Garden is a wide thoroughfare with some modern offices and many older houses, with bracketed doorways and carved woodwork. It has long been associated with the diamond merchant's trade, and now diamond merchants occupy quite half of the offices. It is also the centre of the gold and silver trade. The City Orthopædic Hospital is on the east side.  In Charles Street is the Bleeding Heart public-house, which derives its name from an old religious sign, the Pierced Heart of the Virgin. This is close to Bleeding Heart Yard, referred to in \"Little Dorrit,\" and easily recalled by any reader of Dickens.  In Cross Street there is an old charity school, with stuccoed figures of a charity boy and girl on the frontage. The Caledonian School was formerly in this street; it was removed to its present situation in 1828. Whiston, friend of Sir Isaac Newton, lived here, and here Edward Irving first displayed his powers of preaching.  Kirkby Street recalls what has already been said about the first Bishop of Ely, who purchased land whereon his successors should build a palace. It is a broad street, and in times past was a place of residence for well-to-do people.  The lower part of Saffron Hill was known at first as Field Lane, and is described by Strype as \"narrow and mean, full of Butchers and Tripe Dressers, because the Ditch runs at the back of their Slaughter houses, and carries away the filth.\" He also says that Saffron Hill is a place of small account, \"both as to buildings and inhabitants, and pestered with small and ordinary alleys "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21412"],["title","The Tale of Bobby Bobolink (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"You Were Mistaken,\" Said Mrs. Bobolink.                          _Frontispiece_--(_Page_ 35)]             _SLEEPY-TIME TALES_        (Trademark Registered)              THE TALE OF               BOBBY              BOBOLINK                 BY        ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY           [Illustration]          GROSSET & DUNLAP            PUBLISHERS     COPYRIGHT, 1920, BY GROSSET & DUNLAP     CONTENTS   CHAPTER                                 PAGE        I SOMEBODY IS EXPECTED               1      II THE LATEST ARRIVAL                 6     III GREETINGS                         11      IV SINGING FOR SOME ONE              16       V AN INVITATION                     21      VI MRS.

They were expecting somebody.  \"Have you seen him?\" Rusty Wren asked Jolly Robin.  Jolly Robin said that he hadn't; but he added that he was on the lookout.  \"Have you heard his song?\" little Mr. Chippy inquired eagerly of Mr. Blackbird.  \"No!\" that dusky rascal replied. \"Not yet! Maybe he isn't coming here this summer.\" Mr. Blackbird liked to tease little Mr. Chippy. And generally when he tried to, he succeeded.  \"Oh! Don't say that!\" Mr. Chippy exclaimed. \"If I couldn't hear his gay voice I shouldn't care to spend a summer here myself.\"  Over the meadow, beyond the stone wall where Mr. Chippy made his home in a wild grapevine, Mr. Meadowlark flew to the swampy place where the rushes grew, just to find a Red-winged Blackbird that he knew, in order to learn whether he had seen or heard the friend everybody was watching for.  Perched upon a swaying last year's cattail, Mr. Red-winged Blackbird shook his head in reply. And he said that no doubt it would be a week before the looked-for arrival. \"The season's a bit backward,\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird remarked. \"So I don't expect to set eyes on him to-day--though I have known him to get here as early as May Day.\"  Mr. Meadowlark confessed that he was disappointed.  \"It would be a much gayer May Day,\" he said, \"if his rollicking song rang over the meadow.\"  \"What's the matter with your own singing?\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird asked him--meaning that in his opinion Mr. Meadowlark had no reason to be ashamed of his own voice.  \"My song is not like his,\" Mr. Meadowlark answered. And he sighed as he spoke. \"To be sure, some people are kind enough to say that my singing is unusually sweet. But you know yourself that there isn't a songster anywhere that can carol so joyfully as Bobby Bobolink.\"  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird did not dispute that statement. How could he, when the birds were all waiting so eagerly to hear Bobby Bobolink's voice?  \"He has a way\"--Mr. Meadowlark went on--\"a way of making almost any summer's day a gay holiday. He is just bubbling over with happiness; and he can't seem to get his notes out fast enough.\"  \"Yes!\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird chimed in. \"He's a cheerful, happy-go-lucky chap. And he wears gay clothes, too.\"  \"What's the matter with your own clothes?\" Mr. Meadowlark inquired--meaning that in his opinion Mr. Red-winged Blackbird's black suit, with the shoulders scarlet and buff, was about as striking as anybody could want.  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird was pleased. Anybody could see that. He bowed and spread his wings and tail, and uttered his well-known call, \"Conk-err-ee!\" before he made any reply.  \"People often compliment me on my taste in colors,\" he said at last. \"And for year-round wear I do think _my_ suit is about as good as anybody could ask for. But you know yourself that during the first half of the summer Bobby Bobolink makes a cheerful sight, when his black and white and buff back flashes above the meadow.\"  And Mr. Meadowlark couldn't deny it; for he knew that it was true.     II  THE LATEST ARRIVAL   BOBBY BOBOLINK did not reach Pleasant Valley in time to spend May Day with his old friends of the summer before. And although everybody was disappointed not to see him--and hear him--the feathered folk tried to be cheerful and told one another that Bobby ought to arrive almost any day.  \"He always finds it hard to leave the rice fields in the South,\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird observed with a knowing wink at old Mr. Crow, as the two stopped for a chat on the morning after May Day. \"It's rice-planting time in the South,\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird explained. \"Somewhat like corn-planting time here!\" And he winked once more.  Although Mr. Crow was in the habit of scratching up Farmer Green's newly-planted corn, just as Bobby Bobolink uncovered the freshly-sown rice in the South, Mr. Crow never cared to have any of his neighbors even hint that he did such a thing. And now he glared at Mr. Red-winged Blackbird, who continued to wink at him.  \"Is there something in your eye?\" Mr. Crow inquired in his coldest manner.  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird had no wish to make Mr. Crow angry. So he stopped winking at once.  \"When you see your friend Bobby Bobolink you'd better tell him to leave the corn strictly alone,\" Mr. Crow remarked. \"Farmer Green expects to begin planting in about three weeks. And he counts on me to watch the field for him. If I catch Bobby Bobolink there he'll wish he had stayed in the rice fields, down South.\"  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird smiled. And he told old Mr. Crow not to worry.  \"Bobby Bobolink won't touch the corn,\" he said. \"During the first half of the summer he lives on such things as caterpillars and grasshoppers, with a bit of grass-seed now and then.\"  Old Mr. Crow replied that he was glad to know that.  \"He's wise to leave the corn alone,\" he added. \"If Farmer Green was on the lookout for him--with a gun handy--Bobby Bobolink wouldn't act so care-free as he generally does. He wouldn't sing such rollicking songs in the meadow. And now that you've mentioned how he spends his springs in the South, I don't wonder that he appears glad to get to Pleasant Valley. For you may well believe that folks are not so fond of him down there where the rice grows. And unless I'm much mistaken the planters actually order him out of their fields.\"  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird told Mr. Crow that he hadn't a doubt that everything Mr. Crow said was so. And he was just about to remark that he should think Mr. Crow must lead a care-free, happy-go-lucky life in winter, in the South, because Farmer Green always stayed in Pleasant Valley the whole year round. But as he opened his bill to speak he heard a sound over in the meadow that made him forget what was on the tip of his tongue.  \"Did you hear that song?\" he cried. \"Hurrah!\"  Old Mr. Crow cocked his head on one side and listened. \"Yes!\" he agreed. \"There's no doubt about it. Bobby Bobolink is here at last!\"     III  GREETINGS   AS fast as they could fly, old Mr. Crow and Mr. Red-winged Blackbird hurried over to the meadow, where they had heard Bobby Bobolink's bubbling notes.  They found him enjoying himself with a lively company of careless bachelors--all distant cousins of Bobby Bobolink--who had travelled with him in a roistering flock all the way from the South.  They were all wonderful singers--those happy Bobolinks. They could scarcely have kept still if they had wanted to. But somehow Bobby Bobolink seemed to be just a bit the best singer of the lot.  Perched on a fence-post, Mr. Meadowlark was drinking in Bobby's merry songs. Jolly Robin had stolen away from the orchard to greet the newcomer and listen to his first concert. And even Rusty Wren had forsaken the cherry tree beside the farmhouse. Although Rusty and his wife were in the midst of putting their summer house to rights, he had not been able to resist telling Mrs. Wren, who did not like to have him away from home, that he must make a short visit in the meadow, \"to see a friend.\"  Mr. Red-winged Blackbird called \"Conk-err-ee!\" several times to Bobby Bobolink, meaning that he was glad Bobby was back in Pleasant Valley and that he hoped he was in good health, and that Bobby certainly hadn't forgotten how to sing.  As for old Mr. Crow, he winked at Bobby Bobolink and said in a hoarse voice, \"I hear they're planting rice down South.\"  Bobby Bobolink was not like Mr. Crow, who would have flown into a rage had any one made such a remark to him.  \"I stayed a while in the rice fields,\" he answered. \"And if I hadn't come away when I did,\" he added with a laugh, \"I'd have been too fat to fly way up here to Pleasant Valley.\"  Then a torrent of notes came tumbling out of his throat as he darted right over the head of old Mr. Crow (who stood on a hillock) and swerved and zigzagged and wheeled through the air, until Mr. Crow almost tied his neck into a knot, just watching him.  \"By the way,\" Mr. Meadowlark said in an undertone to Mr. Red-winged Blackbird, \"our friend Bobby has a different suit from the one he wore when I last saw him.\"  \"When was that?\" Mr. Red-winged Blackbird inquired.  \"About the middle of last summer!\" Mr. Meadowlark explained.  \"Ah! This is the second suit he has had since then,\" said Mr. Red-winged Blackbird. \"If you had been with us in the swamp last fall you'd have known that Bobby had a new one then. And here he is"]]]
